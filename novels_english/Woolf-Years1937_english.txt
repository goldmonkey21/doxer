The Years

1880


It was an uncertain spring. The weather, perpetually changing,
sent clouds of blue and of purple flying over the land. In the
country farmers, looking at the fields, were apprehensive; in
London umbrellas were opened and then shut by people looking up at
the sky. But in April such weather was to be expected. Thousands
of shop assistants made that remark, as they handed neat parcels to
ladies in flounced dresses standing on the other side of the
counter at Whiteley's and the Army and Navy Stores. Interminable
processions of shoppers in the West end, of business men in the
East, paraded the pavements, like caravans perpetually marching, - 
so it seemed to those who had any reason to pause, say, to post a
letter, or at a club window in Piccadilly. The stream of landaus,
victorias and hansom cabs was incessant; for the season was
beginning. In the quieter streets musicians doled out their frail
and for the most part melancholy pipe of sound, which was echoed,
or parodied, here in the trees of Hyde Park, here in St. James's by
the twitter of sparrows and the sudden outbursts of the amorous but
intermittent thrush. The pigeons in the squares shuffled in the
tree tops, letting fall a twig or two, and crooned over and over
again the lullaby that was always interrupted. The gates at the
Marble Arch and Apsley House were blocked in the afternoon by
ladies in many-coloured dresses wearing bustles, and by gentlemen
in frock coats carrying canes, wearing carnations. Here came the
Princess, and as she passed hats were lifted. In the basements of
the long avenues of the residential quarters servant girls in cap
and apron prepared tea. Deviously ascending from the basement the
silver teapot was placed on the table, and virgins and spinsters
with hands that had staunched the sores of Bermondsey and Hoxton
carefully measured out one, two, three, four spoonfuls of tea.
When the sun went down a million little gaslights, shaped like the
eyes in peacocks' feathers, opened in their glass cages, but
nevertheless broad stretches of darkness were left on the pavement.
The mixed light of the lamps and the setting sun was reflected
equally in the placid waters of the Round Pond and the Serpentine.
Diners-out, trotting over the Bridge in hansom cabs, looked for a
moment at the charming vista. At length the moon rose and its
polished coin, though obscured now and then by wisps of cloud,
shone out with serenity, with severity, or perhaps with complete
indifference. Slowly wheeling, like the rays of a searchlight, the
days, the weeks, the years passed one after another across the sky.



Colonel Abel Pargiter was sitting after luncheon in his club
talking. Since his companions in the leather armchairs were men of
his own type, men who had been soldiers, civil servants, men who
had now retired, they were reviving with old jokes and stories now
their past in India, Africa, Egypt, and then, by a natural
transition, they turned to the present. It was a question of some
appointment, of some possible appointment.

Suddenly the youngest and the sprucest of the three leant forward.
Yesterday he had lunched with . . . Here the voice of the speaker
fell. The others bent towards him; with a brief wave of his hand
Colonel Abel dismissed the servant who was removing the coffee
cups. The three baldish and greyish heads remained close together
for a few minutes. Then Colonel Abel threw himself back in his
chair. The curious gleam which had come into all their eyes when
Major Elkin began his story had faded completely from Colonel
Pargiter's face. He sat staring ahead of him with bright blue eyes
that seemed a little screwed up, as if the glare of the East were
still in them; and puckered at the corners as if the dust were
still in them. Some thought had struck him that made what the
others were saying of no interest to him; indeed, it was
disagreeable to him. He rose and looked out of the window down
into Piccadilly. Holding his cigar suspended he looked down on the
tops of omnibuses, hansom cabs, victorias, vans and landaus. He
was out of it all, his attitude seemed to say; he had no longer any
finger in that pie. Gloom settled on his red handsome face as he
stood gazing. Suddenly a thought struck him. He had a question to
ask; he turned to ask it; but his friends were gone. The little
group had broken up. Elkins was already hurrying through the door;
Brand had moved off to talk to another man. Colonel Pargiter shut
his mouth on the thing he might have said, and turned back again to
the window overlooking Piccadilly. Everybody in the crowded
street, it seemed, had some end in view. Everybody was hurrying
along to keep some appointment. Even the ladies in their victorias
and broughams were trotting down Piccadilly on some errand or
other. People were coming back to London; they were settling in
for the season. But for him there would be no season; for him
there was nothing to do. His wife was dying; but she did not die.
She was better today; would be worse tomorrow; a new nurse was
coming; and so it went on. He picked up a paper and turned over
the pages. He looked at a picture of the west front of Cologne
Cathedral. He tossed the paper back into its place among the other
papers. One of these days - that was his euphemism for the time
when his wife was dead - he would give up London, he thought, and
live in the country. But then there was the house; then there were
the children; and there was also . . . his face changed; it became
less discontented; but also a little furtive and uneasy.

He had somewhere to go, after all. While they were gossiping he
had kept that thought at the back of his mind. When he turned
round and found them gone, that was the balm he clapped on his
wound. He would go and see Mira; Mira at least would be glad to
see him. Thus when he left the club he turned not East, where the
busy men were going; nor West where his own house in Abercorn
Terrace was; but took his way along the hard paths through the
Green Park towards Westminster. The grass was very green; the
leaves were beginning to shoot; little green claws, like birds'
claws, were pushing out from the branches; there was a sparkle, an
animation everywhere; the air smelt clean and brisk. But Colonel
Pargiter saw neither the grass nor the trees. He marched through
the Park, in his closely buttoned coat, looking straight ahead of
him. But when he came to Westminster he stopped. He did not like
this part of the business at all. Every time he approached the
little street that lay under the huge bulk of the Abbey, the street
of dingy little houses, with yellow curtains and cards in the
window, the street where the muffin man seemed always to be ringing
his bell, where children screamed and hopped in and out of white
chalk-marks on the pavement, he paused, looked to the right, looked
to the left; and then walked very sharply to Number Thirty and rang
the bell. He gazed straight at the door as he waited with his head
rather sunk. He did not wish to be seen standing on that door-
step. He did not like waiting to be let in. He did not like it
when Mrs Sims let him in. There was always a smell in the house;
there were always dirty clothes hanging on a line in the back
garden. He went up the stairs, sulkily and heavily, and entered
the sitting-room.

Nobody was there; he was too early. He looked round the room with
distaste. There were too many little objects about. He felt out
of place, and altogether too large as he stood upright before the
draped fireplace in front of a screen upon which was painted a
kingfisher in the act of alighting on some bulrushes. Footsteps
scurried about hither and thither on the floor above. Was there
somebody with her? he asked himself listening. Children screamed
in the street outside. It was sordid; it was mean; it was furtive.
One of these days, he said to himself . . . but the door opened and
his mistress, Mira, came in.

"Oh Bogy, dear!" she exclaimed. Her hair was very untidy; she was
a little fluffy-looking; but she was very much younger than he was
and really glad to see him, he thought. The little dog bounced up
at her.

"Lulu, Lulu," she cried, catching the little dog in one hand while
she put the other to her hair, "come and let Uncle Bogy look at
you."

The Colonel settled himself in the creaking basket-chair. She put
the dog on his knee. There was a red patch - possibly eczema - 
behind one of its ears. The Colonel put on his glasses and bent
down to look at the dog's ear. Mira kissed him where his collar
met his neck. Then his glasses fell off. She snatched them and
put them on the dog. The old boy was out of spirits today, she
felt. In that mysterious world of clubs and family life of which
he never spoke to her something was wrong. He had come before she
had done her hair, which was a nuisance. But her duty was to
distract him. So she flitted - her figure, enlarging as it was,
still allowed her to glide between table and chair - hither and
thither; removed the fire-screen and set a light, before he could
stop her, to the grudging lodging-house fire. Then she perched on
the arm of his chair.

"Oh, Mira!" she said, glancing at herself in the looking-glass and
shifting her hair-pins, "what a dreadfully untidy girl you are!"
She loosed a long coil and let it fall over her shoulders. It was
beautiful gold-glancing hair still, though she was nearing forty
and had, if the truth were known, a daughter of eight boarded out
with friends at Bedford. The hair began to fall of its own accord,
of its own weight, and Bogy seeing it fall stooped and kissed her
hair. A barrel-organ had begun to play down the street and the
children all rushed in that direction, leaving a sudden silence.
The Colonel began to stroke her neck. He began fumbling, with the
hand that had lost two fingers, rather lower down, where the neck
joins the shoulders. Mira slipped onto the floor and leant her
back against his knee.

Then there was a creaking on the stairs; someone tapped as if to
warn them of her presence. Mira at once pinned her hair together,
got up and shut the door.

The Colonel began in his methodical way to examine the dog's ears
again. Was it eczema? or was it not eczema? He looked at the red
patch, then set the dog on its legs in the basket and waited. He
did not like the prolonged whispering on the landing outside. At
length Mira came back; she looked worried; and when she looked
worried she looked old. She began hunting about under cushions and
covers. She wanted her bag, she said; where had she put her bag?
In that litter of things, the Colonel thought, it might be
anywhere. It was a lean, poverty-stricken-looking bag when she
found it under the cushions in the corner of the sofa. She turned
it upside down. Pocket handkerchiefs, screwed up bits of paper,
silver and coppers fell out as she shook it. But there should have
been a sovereign, she said. "I'm sure I had one yesterday," she
murmured.

"How much?" said the Colonel.

It came to one pound - no, it came to one pound eight and sixpence,
she said, muttering something about the washing. The Colonel
slipped two sovereigns out of his little gold case and gave them to
her. She took them and there was more whispering on the landing.

"Washing . . . ?" thought the Colonel, looking round the room. It
was a dingy little hole; but being so much older than she was it
did not do to ask questions about the washing. Here she was again.
She flitted across the room and sat on the floor and put her head
against his knee. The grudging fire which had been flickering
feebly had died down now. "Let it be," he said impatiently, as she
took up the poker. "Let it go out." She resigned the poker. The
dog snored; the barrel organ played. His hand began its voyage up
and down her neck, in and out of the long thick hair. In this
small room, so close to the other houses, dusk came quickly; and
the curtains were half drawn. He drew her to him; he kissed her on
the nape of the neck; and then the hand that had lost two fingers
began to fumble rather lower down where the neck joins the
shoulders.



A sudden squall of rain struck the pavement, and the children, who
had been skipping in and out of their chalk cages, scudded away
home. The elderly street singer, who had been swaying along the
kerb, with a fisherman's cap stuck jauntily on the back of his
head, lustily chanting "Count your blessings, Count your blessings - "
turned up his coat collar and took refuge under the portico of a
public house where he finished his injunction: "Count your
blessings. Every One." Then the sun shone again; and dried the
pavement.



"It's not boiling," said Milly Pargiter, looking at the tea-kettle.
She was sitting at the round table in the front drawing-room of the
house in Abercorn Terrace. "Not nearly boiling," she repeated.
The kettle was an old-fashioned brass kettle, chased with a design
of roses that was almost obliterated. A feeble little flame
flickered up and down beneath the brass bowl. Her sister Delia,
lying back in a chair beside her, watched it too. "Must a kettle
boil?" she asked idly after a moment, as if she expected no answer,
and Milly did not answer. They sat in silence watching the little
flame on a tuft of yellow wick. There were many plates and cups as
if other people were coming; but at the moment they were alone.
The room was full of furniture. Opposite them stood a Dutch
cabinet with blue china on the shelves; the sun of the April
evening made a bright stain here and there on the glass. Over the
fireplace the portrait of a red-haired young woman in white muslin
holding a basket of flowers on her lap smiled down on them.

Milly took a hairpin from her head and began to fray the wick into
separate strands so as to increase the size of the flame.

"But that doesn't  do any good," Delia said irritably as she watched
her. She fidgeted. Everything seemed to take such an intolerable
time. Then Crosby came in and said, should she boil the kettle in
the kitchen? and Milly said No. How can I put a stop to this
fiddling and trifling, she said to herself, tapping a knife on the
table and looking at the feeble flame that her sister was teasing
with a hairpin. A gnat's voice began to wail under the kettle; but
here the door burst open again and a little girl in a stiff pink
frock came in.

"I think Nurse might have put you on a clean pinafore," said Milly
severely, imitating the manner of a grown-up person. There was a
green smudge on her pinafore as if she had been climbing trees.

"It hadn't  come back from the wash," said Rose, the little girl,
grumpily. She looked at the table, but there was no question of
tea yet.

Milly applied her hairpin to the wick again. Delia leant back and
glanced over her shoulder out of the window. From where she sat
she could see the front door steps.

"Now, there's Martin," she said gloomily. The door slammed; books
were slapped down on the hall table, and Martin, a boy of twelve,
came in. He had the red hair of the woman in the picture, but it
was rumpled.

"Go and make yourself tidy," said Delia severely. "You've  plenty
of time," she added. "The kettle isn't  boiling yet."

They all looked at the kettle. It still kept up its faint
melancholy singing as the little flame flickered under the swinging
bowl of brass.

"Blast that kettle," said Martin, turning sharply away.

"Mama wouldn't  like you to use language like that," Milly reproved
him as if in imitation of an older person; for their mother had
been ill so long that both sisters had taken to imitating her
manner with the children. The door opened again.

"The tray, Miss . . ." said Crosby, keeping the door open with her
foot. She had an invalid's tray in her hands.

"The tray," said Milly. "Now who's going to take up the tray?"
Again she imitated the manner of an older person who wishes to be
tactful with children.

"Not you, Rose. It's too heavy. Let Martin carry it; and you can
go with him. But don't  stay. Just tell Mama what you've  been
doing; and then the kettle . . . the kettle. . . ."

Here she applied her hairpin to the wick again. A thin puff of
steam issued from the serpent-shaped spout. At first intermittent,
it gradually became more and more powerful, until, just as they
heard steps on the stairs, one jet of powerful steam issued from
the spout.

"It's boiling!" Milly exclaimed. "It's boiling!"



They ate in silence. The sun, judging from the changing lights on
the glass of the Dutch cabinet, seemed to be going in and out.
Sometimes a bowl shone deep blue; then became livid. Lights rested
furtively upon the furniture in the other room. Here was a
pattern; here was a bald patch. Somewhere there's beauty, Delia
thought, somewhere there's freedom, and somewhere, she thought, HE
is - wearing his white flower. . . . But a stick grated in the
hall.

"It's Papa!" Milly exclaimed warningly.

Instantly Martin wriggled out of his father's armchair; Delia sat
upright. Milly at once moved forward a very large rose-sprinkled
cup that did not match the rest. The Colonel stood at the door and
surveyed the group rather fiercely. His small blue eyes looked
round them as if to find fault; at the moment there was no
particular fault to find; but he was out of temper; they knew at
once before he spoke that he was out of temper.

"Grubby little ruffian," he said, pinching Rose by the ear as he
passed her. She put her hand at once over the stain on her
pinafore.

"Mama all right?" he said, letting himself down in one solid mass
into the big armchair. He detested tea; but he always sipped a
little from the huge old cup that had been his father's. He raised
it and sipped perfunctorily.

"And what have you all been up to?" he asked.

He looked round him with the smoky but shrewd gaze that could be
genial, but was surly now.

"Delia had her music lesson, and I went to Whiteley's - " Milly
began, rather as if she were a child reciting a lesson.

"Spending money, eh?" said her father sharply, but not unkindly.

"No, Papa; I told you. They sent the wrong sheets - "

"And you, Martin?" Colonel Pargiter asked, cutting short his
daughter's statement. "Bottom of the class as usual?"

"Top!" shouted Martin, bolting the word out as if he had restrained
it with difficulty until this moment.

"Hm - you don't  say so," said his father. His gloom relaxed a
little. He put his hand into his trouser pocket and brought out a
handful of silver. His children watched him as he tried to single
out one sixpence from all the florins. He had lost two fingers of
the right hand in the Mutiny, and the muscles had shrunk so that
the right hand resembled the claw of some aged bird. He shuffled
and fumbled; but as he always ignored the injury, his children
dared not help him. The shiny knobs of the mutilated fingers
fascinated Rose.

"Here you are, Martin," he said at length, handing the sixpence to
his son. Then he sipped his tea again and wiped his moustaches.

"Where's Eleanor?" he said at last, as if to break the silence.

"It's her Grove day," Milly reminded him.

"Oh, her Grove day," muttered the Colonel. He stirred the sugar
round and round in the cup as if to demolish it.

"The dear old Levys," said Delia tentatively. She was his
favourite daughter; but she felt uncertain in his present mood how
much she could venture.

He said nothing.

"Bertie Levy's got six toes on one foot," Rose piped up suddenly.
The others laughed. But the Colonel cut them short.

"You hurry up and get off to your prep., my boy," he said, glancing
at Martin, who was still eating.

"Let him finish his tea, Papa," said Milly, again imitating the
manner of an older person.

"And the new nurse?" the Colonel asked, drumming on the edge of the
table. "Has she come?"

"Yes . . ." Milly began. But there was a rustling in the hall and
in came Eleanor. It was much to their relief; especially to
Milly's. Thank goodness, there's Eleanor she thought, looking up - 
the soother, the maker-up of quarrels, the buffer between her and
the intensities and strifes of family life. She adored her sister.
She would have called her goddess and endowed her with a beauty
that was not hers, with clothes that were not hers, had she not
been carrying a pile of little mottled books and two black gloves.
Protect me, she thought, handing her a teacup, who am such a mousy,
downtrodden inefficient little chit, compared with Delia, who
always gets her way, while I'm always snubbed by Papa, who was
grumpy for some reason. The Colonel smiled at Eleanor. And the
red dog on the hearthrug looked up too and wagged his tail, as if
he recognised her for one of those satisfactory women who give you
a bone, but wash their hands afterwards. She was the eldest of the
daughters, about twenty-two, no beauty, but healthy, and though
tired at the moment, naturally cheerful.

"I'm sorry I'm late," she said. "I got kept. And I didn't  expect - "
She looked at her father.

"I got off earlier than I thought," he said hastily. "The meeting - "
he stopped short. There had been another row with Mira.

"And how's your Grove, eh?" he added.

"Oh, my Grove - " she repeated; but Milly handed her the covered
dish.

"I got kept," Eleanor said again, helping herself. She began to
eat; the atmosphere lightened.

"Now tell us, Papa," said Delia boldly - she was his favourite
daughter - "what you've  been doing with yourself. Had any
adventures?"

The remark was unfortunate.

"There aren't  any adventures for an old fogy like me," said the
Colonel surlily. He ground the grains of sugar against the walls
of his cup. Then he seemed to repent of his gruffness; he pondered
for a moment.

"I met old Burke at the Club; asked me to bring one of you to
dinner; Robin's back, on leave," he said.

He drank up his tea. Some drops fell on his little pointed beard.
He took out his large silk handkerchief and wiped his chin
impatiently. Eleanor, sitting on her low chair, saw a curious look
first on Milly's face, then on Delia's. She had an impression of
hostility between them. But they said nothing. They went on
eating and drinking until the Colonel took up his cup, saw there
was nothing in it, and put it down firmly with a little chink. The
ceremony of tea-drinking was over.

"Now, my boy, take yourself off and get on with your prep.," he
said to Martin.

Martin withdrew the hand that was stretched towards a plate.

"Cut along," said the Colonel imperiously. Martin got up and went,
drawing his hand reluctantly along the chairs and tables as if to
delay his passage. He slammed the door rather sharply behind him.
The Colonel rose and stood upright among them in his tightly
buttoned frock-coat.

"And I must be off too," he said. But he paused a moment, as if
there was nothing particular for him to be off to. He stood there
very erect among them, as if he wished to give some order, but
could not at the moment think of any order to give. Then he
recollected.

"I wish one of you would remember," he said, addressing his
daughters impartially, "to write to Edward. . . . Tell him to
write to Mama."

"Yes," said Eleanor.

He moved towards the door. But he stopped.

"And let me know when Mama wants to see me," he remarked. Then he
paused and pinched his youngest daughter by the ear.

"Grubby little ruffian," he said, pointing to the green stain on
her pinafore. She covered it with her hand. At the door he paused
again.

"Don't  forget," he said, fumbling with the handle, "don't  forget to
write to Edward." At last he had turned the handle and was gone.



They were silent. There was something strained in the atmosphere,
Eleanor felt. She took one of the little books that she had
dropped on the table and laid it open on her knee. But she did not
look at it. Her glance fixed itself rather absent-mindedly upon
the farther room. The trees were coming out in the back garden;
there were little leaves - little ear-shaped leaves on the bushes.
The sun was shining, fitfully; it was going in and it was going
out, lighting up now this, now - 

"Eleanor," Rose interrupted. She held herself in a way that was
oddly like her father's.

"Eleanor," she repeated in a low voice, for her sister was not
attending.

"Well?" said Eleanor, looking at her.

"I want to go to Lamley's," said Rose.

She looked the image of her father, standing there with her hands
behind her back.

"It's too late for Lamley's," said Eleanor.

"They don't  shut till seven," said Rose.

"Then ask Martin to go with you," said Eleanor.

The little girl moved off slowly towards the door. Eleanor took up
her account-books again.

"But you're not to go alone, Rose; you're not to go alone," she
said, looking up over them as Rose reached the door. Nodding her
head in silence, Rose disappeared.



She went upstairs. She paused outside her mother's bedroom and
snuffed the sour-sweet smell that seemed to hang about the jugs,
the tumblers, the covered bowls on the table outside the door. Up
she went again, and stopped outside the schoolroom door. She did
not want to go in, for she had quarrelled with Martin. They had
quarrelled first about Erridge and the microscope and then about
shooting Miss Pym's cats next door. But Eleanor had told her to
ask him. She opened the door.

"Hullo, Martin - " she began.

He was sitting at a table with a book propped in front of him,
muttering to himself - perhaps it was Greek, perhaps it was Latin.

"Eleanor told me - " she began, noting how flushed he looked, and
how his hand closed on a bit of paper as if he were going to screw
it into a ball. "To ask you . . ." she began, and braced herself
and stood with her back against the door.



Eleanor leant back in her chair. The sun now was on the trees in
the back garden. The buds were beginning to swell. The spring
light of course showed up the shabbiness of the chair-covers. The
large armchair had a dark stain on it where her father had rested
his head, she noticed. But what a number of chairs there were - how
roomy, how airy it was after that bedroom where old Mrs Levy - But
Milly and Delia were both silent. It was the question of the
dinner-party, she remembered. Which of them was to go? They both
wanted to go. She wished people would not say, "Bring one of your
daughters." She wished they would say, "Bring Eleanor," or "Bring
Milly," or "Bring Delia," instead of lumping them all together.
Then there could be no question.

"Well," said Delia abruptly, "I shall . . ."

She got up as if she were going somewhere. But she stopped. Then
she strolled over to the window that looked out onto the street.
The houses opposite all had the same little front gardens; the same
steps; the same pillars; the same bow windows. But now dusk was
falling and they looked spectral and insubstantial in the dim
light. Lamps were being lit; a light glowed in the drawing-room
opposite; then the curtains were drawn, and the room was blotted
out. Delia stood looking down at the street. A woman of the lower
classes was wheeling a perambulator; an old man tottered along with
his hands behind his back. Then the street was empty; there was a
pause. Here came a hansom jingling down the road. Delia was
momentarily interested. Was it going to stop at their door or not?
She gazed more intently. But then, to her regret, the cabman
jerked his reins, the horse stumbled on; the cab stopped two doors
lower down.

"Someone's calling on the Stapletons," she called back, holding
apart the muslin blind. Milly came and stood beside her sister,
and together, through the slit, they watched a young man in a top-
hat get out of the cab. He stretched his hand up to pay the
driver.

"Don't  be caught looking," said Eleanor warningly. The young man
ran up the steps into the house; the door shut upon him and the cab
drove away.

But for the moment the two girls stood at the window looking into
the street. The crocuses were yellow and purple in the front
gardens. The almond trees and privets were tipped with green. A
sudden gust of wind tore down the street, blowing a piece of paper
along the pavement; and a little swirl of dry dust followed after.
Above the roofs was one of those red and fitful London sunsets that
make window after window burn gold. There was a wildness in the
spring evening; even here, in Abercorn Terrace the light was
changing from gold to black, from black to gold. Dropping the
blind, Delia turned, and coming back into the drawing-room, said
suddenly:

"Oh my God!"

Eleanor, who had taken her books again, looked up disturbed.

"Eight times eight . . ." she said aloud. "What's eight times
eight?"

Putting her finger on the page to mark the place, she looked at her
sister. As she stood there with her head thrown back and her hair
red in the sunset glow, she looked for a moment defiant, even
beautiful. Beside her Milly was mouse-coloured and nondescript.

"Look here, Delia," said Eleanor, shutting her book, "you've  only
got to wait . . ." She meant but she could not say it, "until Mama
dies."

"No, no, no," said Delia, stretching her arms out. "It's
hopeless. . . ." she began. But she broke off, for Crosby had come
in. She was carrying a tray. One by one with an exasperating
little chink she put the cups, the plates, the knives, the jam-pots,
the dishes of cake and the dishes of bread and butter, on the tray.
Then, balancing it carefully in front of her, she went out. There
was a pause. In she came again and folded the table-cloth and moved
the tables. Again there was a pause. A moment or two later back
she came carrying two silk-shaded lamps. She set one in the front
room, one in the back room. Then she went, creaking in her cheap
shoes, to the window and drew the curtains. They slid with a
familiar click along the brass rod, and soon the windows were
obscured by thick sculptured folds of claret-coloured plush. When
she had drawn the curtains in both rooms, a profound silence seemed
to fall upon the drawing-room. The world outside seemed thickly
and entirely cut off. Far away down the next street they heard the
voice of a street hawker droning; the heavy hooves of van horses
clopped slowly down the road. For a moment wheels ground on the
road; then they died out and the silence was complete.

Two yellow circles of light fell under the lamps. Eleanor drew her
chair up under one of them, bent her head and went on with the part
of her work that she always left to the last because she disliked
it so much - adding up figures. Her lips moved and her pencil made
little dots on the paper as she added eights to sixes, fives to
fours.

"There!" she said at last. "That's done. Now I'll go and sit with
Mama."

She stooped to pick up her gloves.

"No," said Milly, throwing aside a magazine she had opened, "I'll
go . . ."

Delia suddenly emerged from the back room in which she had been
prowling.

"I've  nothing whatever to do," she said briefly. "I'll go."



She went upstairs, step by step, very slowly. When she came to the
bedroom door with the jugs and glasses on the table outside, she
paused. The sour-sweet smell of illness slightly sickened her.
She could not force herself to go in. Through the little window at
the end of the passage she could see flamingo-coloured curls of
cloud lying on a pale-blue sky. After the dusk of the drawing-
room, her eyes dazzled. She seemed fixed there for a moment by the
light. Then on the floor above she heard children's voices - Martin
and Rose quarrelling.

"Don't  then!" she heard Rose say. A door slammed. She paused.
Then she drew in a deep breath of air, looked once more at the
fiery sky, and tapped on the bedroom door.

The nurse rose quietly; put her finger to her lips, and left the
room. Mrs Pargiter was asleep. Lying in a cleft of the pillows
with one hand under her cheek, Mrs Pargiter moaned slightly as if
she wandered in a world where even in sleep little obstacles lay
across her path. Her face was pouched and heavy; the skin was
stained with brown patches; the hair which had been red was now
white, save that there were queer yellow patches in it, as if some
locks had been dipped in the yolk of an egg. Bare of all rings
save her wedding ring, her fingers alone seemed to indicate that
she had entered the private world of illness. But she did not look
as if she were dying; she looked as if she might go on existing in
this borderland between life and death for ever. Delia could see
no change in her. As she sat down, everything seemed to be at full
tide in her. A long narrow glass by the bedside reflected a
section of the sky; it was dazzled at the moment with red light.
The dressing-table was illuminated. The light struck on silver
bottles and on glass bottles, all set out in the perfect order of
things that are not used. At this hour of the evening the sick-
room had an unreal cleanliness, quiet and order. There by the
bedside was a little table set with spectacles, prayer-book and a
vase of lilies of the valley. The flowers, too, looked unreal.
There was nothing to do but to look.

She stared at the yellow drawing of her grandfather with the high
light on his nose; at the photograph of her Uncle Horace in his
uniform; at the lean and twisted figure on the crucifix to the
right.

"But you don't  believe in it!" she said savagely, looking at her
mother sunk in sleep. "You don't  want to die."

She longed for her to die. There she was - soft, decayed but
everlasting, lying in the cleft of the pillows, an obstacle, a
prevention, an impediment to all life. She tried to whip up some
feeling of affection, of pity. For instance, that summer, she told
herself, at Sidmouth, when she called me up the garden steps. . . .
But the scene melted as she tried to look at it. There was the
other scene of course - the man in the frock-coat with the flower in
his button-hole. But she had sworn not to think of that till
bedtime. What then should she think of? Grandpapa with the white
light on his nose? The prayer-book? The lilies of the valley? Or
the looking-glass? The sun had gone in; the glass was dim and
reflected now only a dun-coloured patch of sky. She could resist
no longer.

"Wearing a white flower in his button-hole," she began. It
required a few minutes' preparation. There must be a hall; banks
of palms; a floor beneath them crowded with people's heads. The
charm was beginning to work. She became permeated with delicious
starts of flattering and exciting emotion. She was on the
platform; there was a huge audience; everybody was shouting, waving
handkerchiefs, hissing and whistling. Then she stood up. She rose
all in white in the middle of the platform; Mr Parnell was by her
side.

"I am speaking in the cause of Liberty," she began, throwing out
her hands, "in the cause of Justice. . . ." They were standing
side by side. He was very pale but his dark eyes glowed. He
turned to her and whispered. . . .

There was a sudden interruption. Mrs Pargiter had raised herself
on her pillows.

"Where am I?" she cried. She was frightened and bewildered, as she
often was on waking. She raised her hand; she seemed to appeal for
help. "Where am I?" she repeated. For a moment Delia was
bewildered too. Where was she?

"Here, Mama! Here!" she said wildly. "Here, in your own room."

She laid her hand on the counterpane. Mrs Pargiter clutched it
nervously. She looked round the room as if she were seeking
someone. She did not seem to recognise her daughter.

"What's happening?" she said. "Where am I?" Then she looked at
Delia and remembered.

"Oh, Delia - I was dreaming," she murmured half apologetically. She
lay for a moment looking out of the window. The lamps were being
lit, and a sudden soft spurt of light came in the street outside.

"It's been a fine day . . ." she hesitated, "for . . ." It seemed
as if she could not remember what for.

"A lovely day, yes, Mama," Delia repeated with mechanical
cheerfulness.

". . . for . . ." her mother tried again.

What day was it? Delia could not remember.

". . . for your Uncle Digby's birthday," Mrs Pargiter at last
brought out.

"Tell him from me - tell him how very glad I am."

"I'll tell him," said Delia. She had forgotten her uncle's
birthday; but her mother was punctilious about such things.

"Aunt Eugénie - " she began.

But her mother was staring at the dressing-table. Some gleam from
the lamp outside made the white cloth look extremely white.

"Another clean table-cloth!" Mrs Pargiter murmured peevishly. "The
expense, Delia, the expense - that's what worries me - "

"That's all right, Mama," said Delia dully. Her eyes were fixed
upon her grandfather's portrait; why, she wondered, had the artist
put a dab of white chalk on the tip of his nose?

"Aunt Eugénie brought you some flowers," she said.

For some reason Mrs Pargiter seemed pleased. Her eyes rested
contemplatively on the clean table-cloth that had suggested the
washing bill a moment before.

"Aunt Eugénie . . ." she said. "How well I remember" - her voice
seemed to get fuller and rounder - "the day the engagement was
announced. We were all of us in the garden; there came a letter."
She paused. "There came a letter," she repeated. Then she said no
more for a time. She seemed to be going over some memory.

"The dear little boy died, but save for that . . ." She stopped
again. She seemed weaker tonight, Delia thought; and a start of
joy ran through her. Her sentences were more broken than usual.
What little boy had died? She began counting the twists on the
counterpane as she waited for her mother to speak.

"You know all the cousins used to come together in the summer," her
mother suddenly resumed. "There was your Uncle Horace. . . ."

"The one with the glass eye," said Delia.

"Yes. He hurt his eye on the rocking-horse. The aunts thought so
much of Horace. They would say . . ." Here there was a long
pause. She seemed to be fumbling to find the exact words.

"When Horace comes . . . remember to ask him about the dining-room
door."

A curious amusement seemed to fill Mrs Pargiter. She actually
laughed. She must be thinking of some long-past family joke, Delia
supposed, as she watched the smile flicker and fade away. There
was complete silence. Her mother lay with her eyes shut; the hand
with the single ring, the white and wasted hand, lay on the
counterpane. In the silence they could hear a coal click in the
grate and a street hawker droning down the road. Mrs Pargiter said
no more. She lay perfectly still. Then she sighed profoundly.

The door opened, and the nurse came in. Delia rose and went out.
Where am I? she asked herself, staring at a white jug stained pink
by the setting sun. For a moment she seemed to be in some
borderland between life and death. Where am I? she repeated,
looking at the pink jug, for it all looked strange. Then she heard
water rushing and feet thudding on the floor above.



"Here you are, Rosie," said Nurse, looking up from the wheel of the
sewing-machine as Rose came in.

The nursery was brightly lit; there was an unshaded lamp on the
table. Mrs C., who came every week with the washing, was sitting
in the armchair with a cup in her hand. "Go and get your sewing,
there's a good girl," said Nurse as Rose shook hands with Mrs C.,
"or you'll never be done in time for Papa's birthday," she added,
clearing a space on the nursery table.

Rose opened the table drawer and took out the boot-bag that she was
embroidering with a design of blue and red flowers for her father's
birthday. There were still several clusters of little pencilled
roses to be worked. She spread it on the table and examined it as
Nurse resumed what she was saying to Mrs C. about Mrs Kirby's
daughter. But Rose did not listen.

Then I shall go by myself, she decided, straightening out the boot-
bag. If Martin won't  come with me, then I shall go by myself.

"I left my work-box in the drawing-room," she said aloud.

"Well, then, go and fetch it," said Nurse, but she was not
attending; she wanted to go on with what she was saying to Mrs C.
about the grocer's daughter.



Now the adventure has begun, Rose said to herself as she stole on
tiptoe to the night nursery. Now she must provide herself with
ammunition and provisions; she must steal Nurse's latchkey; but
where was it? Every night it was hidden in a new place for fear of
burglars. It would be either under the handkerchief-case or in the
little box where she kept her mother's gold watch-chain. There it
was. Now she had her pistol and her shot, she thought, taking her
own purse from her own drawer, and enough provisions, she thought,
as she hung her hat and coat over her arm, to last a fortnight.

She stole past the nursery, down the stairs. She listened intently
as she passed the schoolroom door. She must be careful not to
tread on a dry branch, or to let any twig crack under her, she told
herself, as she went on tiptoe. Again she stopped and listened as
she passed her mother's bedroom door. All was silent. Then she
stood for a moment on the landing, looking down into the hall. The
dog was asleep on the mat; the coast was clear; the hall was empty.
She heard voices murmuring in the drawing-room.

She turned the latch of the front door with extreme gentleness, and
closed it with scarcely a click behind her. Until she was round
the corner she crouched close to the wall so that nobody could see
her. When she reached the corner under the laburnum tree she stood
erect.

"I am Pargiter of Pargiter's Horse," she said, flourishing her
hand, "riding to the rescue!"

She was riding by night on a desperate mission to a besieged
garrison, she told herself. She had a secret message - she clenched
her fist on her purse - to deliver to the General in person. All
their lives depended upon it. The British flag was still flying on
the central tower - Lamley's shop was the central tower; the General
was standing on the roof of Lamley's shop with his telescope to his
eye. All their lives depended upon her riding to them through the
enemy's country. Here she was galloping across the desert. She
began to trot. It was growing dark. The street lamps were being
lit. The lamplighter was poking his stick up into the little trap-
door; the trees in the front gardens made a wavering network of
shadow on the pavement; the pavement stretched before her broad and
dark. Then there was the crossing; and then there was Lamley's
shop on the little island of shops opposite. She had only to cross
the desert, to ford the river, and she was safe. Flourishing the
arm that held the pistol, she clapped spurs to her horse and
galloped down Melrose Avenue. As she ran past the pillar-box the
figure of a man suddenly emerged under the gas lamp.

"The enemy!" Rose cried to herself. "The enemy! Bang!" she cried,
pulling the trigger of her pistol and looking him full in the face
as she passed him. It was a horrid face: white, peeled, pock-
marked; he leered at her. He put out his arm as if to stop her.
He almost caught her. She dashed past him. The game was over.

She was herself again, a little girl who had disobeyed her sister,
in her house shoes, flying for safety to Lamley's shop.



Fresh-faced Mrs Lamley was standing behind the counter folding up
the newspapers. She was pondering among her twopenny watches,
cards of tools, toy boats and boxes of cheap stationery something
pleasant, it seemed; for she was smiling. Then Rose burst in. She
looked up enquiringly.

"Hullo, Rosie!" she exclaimed. "What d'you want, my dear?"

She kept her hand on the pile of newspapers. Rose stood there
panting. She had forgotten what she had come for.

"I want the box of ducks in the window," Rose at last remembered.

Mrs Lamley waddled round to fetch it.

"Isn't  it rather late for a little girl like you to be out alone?"
she asked, looking at her as if she knew she had come out in her
house shoes, disobeying her sister.

"Good-night, my dear, and run along home," she said, giving her the
parcel. The child seemed to hesitate on the doorstep: she stood
there staring at the toys under the hanging oil lamp; then out she
went reluctantly.



I gave my message to the General in person, she said to herself as
she stood outside on the pavement again. And this is the trophy,
she said, grasping the box under her arm. I am returning in
triumph with the head of the chief rebel, she told herself, as she
surveyed the stretch of Melrose Avenue before her. I must set
spurs to my horse and gallop. But the story no longer worked.
Melrose Avenue remained Melrose Avenue. She looked down it. There
was the long stretch of bare street in front of her. The trees
were trembling their shadows over the pavement. The lamps stood at
great distances apart, and there were pools of darkness between.
She began to trot. Suddenly, as she passed the lamp-post, she saw
the man again. He was leaning with his back against the lamp-post,
and the light from the gas lamp flickered over his face. As she
passed he sucked his lips in and out. He made a mewing noise. But
he did not stretch his hands out at her; they were unbuttoning his
clothes.

She fled past him. She thought that she heard him coming after
her. She heard his feet padding on the pavement. Everything shook
as she ran; pink and black spots danced before her eyes as she ran
up the door-steps, fitted her key in the latch and opened the hall
door. She did not care whether she made a noise or not. She hoped
somebody would come out and speak to her. But nobody heard her.
The hall was empty. The dog was asleep on the mat. Voices still
murmured in the drawing-room.



"And when it does catch," Eleanor was saying, "it'll be much too
hot."

Crosby had piled the coals into a great black promontory. A plume
of yellow smoke was sullenly twining round it; it was beginning to
burn, and when it did burn it would be much too hot.

"She can see Nurse stealing the sugar, she says. She can see her
shadow on the wall," Milly was saying. They were talking about
their mother.

"And then Edward," she added, "forgetting to write."

"That reminds me," said Eleanor. She must remember to write to
Edward. But there would be time after dinner. She did not want to
write; she did not want to talk; always when she came back from the
Grove she felt as if several things were going on at the same time.
Words went on repeating themselves in her mind - words and sights.
She was thinking of old Mrs Levy, sitting propped up in bed with
her white hair in a thick flop like a wig and her face cracked like
an old glazed pot.

"Them that's been good to me, them I remember . . . them that's
ridden in their coaches when I was a poor widder woman scrubbing
and mangling - " Here she stretched out her arm, which was wrung
and white like the root of a tree. "Them that's been good to me,
them I remember . . ." Eleanor repeated as she looked at the fire.
Then the daughter came in who was working for a tailor. She wore
pearls as big as hen's eggs; she had taken to painting her face;
she was wonderfully handsome. But Milly made a little movement.

"I was thinking," said Eleanor on the spur of the moment, "the poor
enjoy themselves more than we do."

"The Levys?" said Milly absent-mindedly. Then she brightened.

"Do tell me about the Levys," she added. Eleanor's relations with
"the poor" - the Levys, the Grubbs, the Paravicinis, the Zwinglers
and the Cobbs - always amused her. But Eleanor did not like talking
about "the poor" as if they were people in a book. She had a great
admiration for Mrs Levy, who was dying of cancer.

"Oh, they're much as usual," she said sharply. Milly looked at
her. Eleanor's "broody" she thought. The family joke was, "Look
out. Eleanor's broody. It's her Grove day." Eleanor was ashamed,
but she always was irritable for some reason when she came back
from the Grove - so many different things were going on in her head
at the same time: Canning Place; Abercorn Terrace; this room; that
room. There was the old Jewess sitting up in bed in her hot little
room; then one came back here, and there was Mama ill; Papa grumpy;
and Delia and Milly quarrelling about a party. . . . But she
checked herself. She ought to try to say something to amuse her
sister.

"Mrs Levy had her rent ready, for a wonder," she said. "Lily helps
her. Lily's got a job at a tailor's in Shoreditch. She came in
all covered with pearls and things. They do love finery - Jews,"
she added.

"Jews?" said Milly. She seemed to consider the taste of the Jews;
and then to dimiss it.

"Yes," she said. "Shiny."

"She's extraordinarily handsome," said Eleanor, thinking of the red
cheeks and the white pearls.

Milly smiled; Eleanor always would stick up for the poor. She
thought Eleanor the best, the wisest, the most remarkable person
she knew.

"I believe you like going there more than anything," she said. "I
believe you'd like to go and live there if you had your way," she
added, with a little sigh.

Eleanor shifted in her chair. She had her dreams, her plans, of
course; but she did not want to discuss them.

"Perhaps you will, when you're married?" said Milly. There was
something peevish yet plaintive in her voice. The dinner-party;
the Burkes' dinner-party, Eleanor thought. She wished Milly did
not always bring the conversation back to marriage. And what do
they know about marriage? she asked herself. They stay at home too
much, she thought; they never see anyone outside their own set.
Here they are cooped up, day after day. . . . That was why she had
said, "The poor enjoy themselves more than we do." It had struck
her coming back into that drawing-room, with all the furniture and
the flowers and the hospital nurses. . . . Again she stopped
herself. She must wait till she was alone - till she was brushing
her teeth at night. When she was with the others she must stop
herself from thinking of two things at the same time. She took the
poker and struck the coal.

"Look! What a beauty!" she exclaimed. A flame danced on top of
the coal, a nimble and irrelevant flame. It was the sort of flame
they used to make when they were children, by throwing salt on the
fire. She struck again, and a shower of gold-eyed sparks went
volleying up the chimney. "D'you remember," she said, "how we used
to play at firemen, and Morris and I set the chimney on fire?"

"And Pippy went and fetched Papa," said Milly. She paused. There
was a sound in the hall. A stick grated; someone was hanging up a
coat. Eleanor's eyes brightened. That was Morris - yes; she knew
the sound he made. Now he was coming in. She looked round with a
smile as the door opened. Milly jumped up.

Morris tried to stop her.

"Don't  go - " he began.

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "I shall go. I shall go and have a bath,"
she added on the spur of the moment. She left them.



Morris sat down in the chair she had left empty. He was glad to
find Eleanor alone. Neither of them spoke for a moment. They
watched the yellow plume of smoke, and the little flame dancing
nimbly, irrelevantly, here and there on the black promontory of
coals. Then he asked the usual question:

"How's Mama?"

She told him; there was no change: "except that she sleeps more,"
she said. He wrinkled his forehead. He was losing his boyish
look, Eleanor thought. That was the worst of the Bar, everyone
said; one had to wait. He was devilling for Sanders Curry; and it
was dreary work, hanging about the Courts all day, waiting.

"How's old Curry?" she asked - old Curry had a temper.

"A bit liverish," said Morris grimly.

"And what have you been doing all day?" she asked.

"Nothing in particular," he replied.

"Still Evans v. Carter?"

"Yes," he said briefly.

"And who's going to win?" she asked.

"Carter, of course," he replied.

Why "of course" she wanted to ask? But she had said something
silly the other day - something that showed that she had not been
attending. She muddled things up; for example, what was the
difference between Common Law and the other kind of law? She said
nothing. They sat in silence, and watched the flame playing on the
coals. It was a green flame, nimble, irrelevant.

"D'you think I've  been an awful fool," he asked suddenly. "With
all this illness, and Edward and Martin to be paid for - Papa must
find it a bit of a strain." He wrinkled his brow up in the way
that made her say to herself that he was losing his boyish look.

"Of course not," she said emphatically. Of course it would have
been absurd for him to go into business; his passion was for the
Law.

"You'll be Lord Chancellor one of these days," she said. "I'm sure
of it." He shook his head, smiling.

"Quite sure," she said, looking at him as she used to look at him
when he came back from school and Edward had all the prizes and
Morris sat silent - she could see him now - bolting his food with
nobody making a fuss of him. But even while she looked, a doubt
came over her. Lord Chancellor, she had said. Ought she not to
have said Lord Chief Justice? She never could remember which was
which: and that was why he would not discuss Evans v. Carter with
her.

She never told him about the Levys either, except by way of a joke.
That was the worst of growing up, she thought; they couldn't  share
things as they used to share them. When they met they never had
time to talk as they used to talk - about things in general - they
always talked about facts - little facts. She poked the fire.
Suddenly a blare of sound rang through the room. It was Crosby
applying herself to the gong in the hall. She was like a savage
wreaking vengeance upon some brazen victim. Ripples of rough sound
rang through the room. "Lord, that's the dressing-bell!" said
Morris. He got up and stretched himself. He raised his arms and
held them for a moment suspended above his head. That's what he'll
look like when he's the father of a family, Eleanor thought. He
let his arms fall and left the room. She sat brooding for a
moment; then she roused herself. What must I remember? she asked
herself. To write to Edward, she mused, crossing over to her
mother's writing-table. It'll be my table now, she thought,
looking at the silver candlestick, the miniature of her grandfather,
the tradesmen's books - one had a gilt cow stamped on it - and the
spotted walrus with a brush in its back that Martin had given his
mother on her last birthday.



Crosby held open the door of the dining-room as she waited for them
to come down. The silver paid for polishing, she thought. Knives
and forks rayed out round the table. The whole room, with its
carved chairs, oil paintings, the two daggers on the mantel-piece,
and the handsome sideboard - all the solid objects that Crosby
dusted and polished every day - looked at its best in the evening.
Meat-smelling and serge-curtained by day, it looked lit up, semi-
transparent in the evening. And they were a handsome family, she
thought as they filed in - the young ladies in their pretty dresses
of blue and white sprigged muslin; the gentlemen so spruce in their
dinner jackets. She pulled the Colonel's chair out for him. He
was always at his best in the evening; he enjoyed his dinner; and
for some reason his gloom had vanished. He was in his jovial mood.
His children's spirits rose as they noted it.

"That's a pretty frock you're wearing," he said to Delia as he sat
down.

"This old one?" she said, patting the blue muslin.

There was an opulence, an ease and a charm about him when he was in
a good temper that she liked particularly. People always said she
was like him; sometimes she was glad of it - tonight for instance.
He looked so pink and clean and genial in his dinner-jacket. They
became children again when he was in this mood, and were spurred on
to make family jokes at which they all laughed for no particular
reason.

"Eleanor's broody," said her father, winking at them. "It's her
Grove day."

Everybody laughed; Eleanor had thought he was talking about Rover,
the dog, when in fact he was talking about Mrs Egerton, the lady.
Crosby, who was handing the soup, crinkled up her face because she
wanted to laugh too. Sometimes the Colonel made Crosby laugh so
much that she had to turn away and pretend to be doing something at
the sideboard.

"Oh, Mrs Egerton - " said Eleanor, beginning her soup.

"Yes, Mrs Egerton," said her father, and went on telling his story
about Mrs Egerton, "whose golden hair was said by the voice of
slander not to be entirely her own."

Delia liked listening to her father's stories about India. They
were crisp, and at the same time romantic. They conveyed an
atmosphere of officers dining together in mess jackets on a very
hot night with a huge silver trophy in the middle of the table.

He used always to be like this when we were small, she thought. He
used to jump over the bonfire on her birthday, she remembered. She
watched him flicking cutlets dexterously on to plates with his left
hand. She admired his decision, his common sense. Flicking the
cutlets on to plates, he went on - 

"Talking of the lovely Mrs Egerton reminds me - did I ever tell you
the story of old Badger Parkes and - "

"Miss - " said Crosby in a whisper, opening the door behind
Eleanor's back. She whispered a few words to Eleanor privately.

"I'll come," said Eleanor, getting up.

"What's that - what's that?" said the Colonel, stopping in the
middle of his sentence. Eleanor left the room.

"Some message from Nurse," said Milly.

The Colonel, who had just helped himself to cutlets, held his knife
and fork in his hand. They all held their knives suspended.
Nobody liked to go on eating.

"Well, let's get on with our dinner," said the Colonel, abruptly
attacking his cutlet. He had lost his geniality. Morris helped
himself tentatively to potatoes. Then Crosby reappeared. She
stood at the door, with her pale-blue eyes looking very prominent.

"What is it, Crosby? What is it?" said the Colonel.

"The Mistress, sir, taken worse, I think, sir," she said with a
curious whimper in her voice. Everybody got up.

"You wait. I'll go and see," said Morris. They all followed him
out into the hall. The Colonel was still holding his dinner
napkin. Morris ran upstairs; in a moment he came down again.

"Mama's had a fainting-fit," he said to the Colonel. "I'm going to
fetch Prentice." He snatched his hat and coat and ran down the
front steps. They heard him whistling for a cab as they stood
uncertainly in the hall.

"Finish your dinner, girls," said the Colonel peremptorily. But he
paced up and down the drawing-room, holding his dinner napkin in
his hand.



"It has come," Delia said to herself; "it has come!" An
extraordinary feeling of relief and excitement possessed her. Her
father was pacing from one drawing-room to the other; she followed
him in; but she avoided him. They were too much alike; each knew
what the other was feeling. She stood at the window looking up the
street. There had been a shower of rain. The street was wet; the
roofs were shining. Dark clouds were moving across the sky; the
branches were tossing up and down in the light of the street lamps.
Something in her was tossing up and down too. Something unknown
seemed to be approaching. Then a gulping sound behind her made her
turn. It was Milly. She was standing by the mantelpiece under the
picture of the white-robed girl with the flower-basket, and the
tears slid slowly down her cheeks. Delia moved towards her; she
ought to go up to her and put her arms round her shoulders; but she
could not do it. Real tears were sliding down Milly's cheeks. But
her own eyes were dry. She turned to the window again. The street
was empty - only the branches were tossing up and down in the
lamplight. The Colonel paced up and down; once he knocked against
a table and said "Damn!" They heard steps moving about in the room
upstairs. They heard voices murmuring. Delia turned to the
window.

A hansom came trotting down the street. Morris jumped out directly
the cab stopped. Dr. Prentice followed him. He went straight
upstairs and Morris joined them in the drawing-room.

"Why not finish your dinner?" the Colonel said gruffly, coming to a
halt and standing upright before them.

"Oh, after he's gone," said Morris irritably.

The Colonel resumed his pacing.

Then he stopped his pacing, and stood with his hands behind him in
front of the fire. He had a braced look as if he were holding
himself ready for an emergency.

We're both acting, Delia thought to herself, stealing a glance at
him, but he's doing it better than I am.

She looked out of the window again. The rain was falling. When it
crossed the lamplight it glanced in long strips of silver light.

"It's raining," she said in a low voice, but nobody answered her.

At last they heard footsteps on the stairs and Dr. Prentice came
in. He shut the door quietly but said nothing.

"Well?" said the Colonel, facing up to him.

There was a prolonged pause.

"How d'you find her?" said the Colonel.

Dr. Prentice moved his shoulders slightly.

"She's rallied," he said. "For the moment," he added.

Delia felt as if his words struck her violently a blow on the head.
She sank down on the arm of a chair.

So you're not going to die, she said, looking at the girl balanced
on the trunk of a tree; she seemed to simper down at her daughter
with smiling malice. You're not going to die - never, never! she
cried clenching her hands together beneath her mother's picture.

"Now, shall we get on with our dinner?" said the Colonel, taking up
the napkin which he had dropped on the drawing-room table.



It was a pity - the dinner was spoilt, Crosby thought, bringing up
the cutlets from the kitchen again. The meat was dried up, and the
potatoes had a brown crust on top of them. One of the candles was
scorching its shade too, she observed as she put the dish down in
front of the Colonel. Then she shut the door on them, and they
began to eat their dinner.



All was quiet in the house. The dog slept on its mat at the foot
of the stairs. All was quiet outside the sickroom door. A faint
sound of snoring came from the bedroom where Martin lay asleep. In
the day nursery Mrs C. and the nurse had resumed their supper,
which they had interrupted when they heard sounds in the hall
below. Rose lay asleep in the night nursery. For some time she
slept profoundly, curled round with the blankets tight twisted over
her head. Then she stirred and stretched her arms out. Something
had swum up on top of the blackness. An oval white shape hung in
front of her dangling, as if it hung from a string. She half
opened her eyes and looked at it. It bubbled with grey spots that
went in and out. She woke completely. A face was hanging close to
her as if it dangled on a bit of string. She shut her eyes; but
the face was still there, bubbling in and out, grey, white,
purplish and pock-marked. She put out her hand to touch the big
bed next hers. But it was empty. She listened. She heard the
clatter of knives and the chatter of voices in the day nursery
across the passage. But she could not sleep.

She made herself think of a flock of sheep penned up in a hurdle in
a field. She made one of the sheep jump the hurdle; then another.
She counted them as they jumped. One, two, three, four - they
jumped over the hurdle. But the fifth sheep would not jump. It
turned round and looked at her. Its long narrow face was grey; its
lips moved; it was the face of the man at the pillar-box, and she
was alone with it. If she shut her eyes there it was; if she
opened them, there it was still.

She sat up in bed and cried out, "Nurse! Nurse!"

There was dead silence everywhere. The clatter of knives and forks
in the next room had ceased. She was alone with something
horrible. Then she heard a shuffling in the passage. It came
closer and closer. It was the man himself. His hand was on the
door. The door opened. An angle of light fell across the wash-
stand. The jug and basin were lit up. The man was actually in the
room with her . . . but it was Eleanor.



"Why aren't  you asleep?" said Eleanor. She put down her candle and
began to straighten the bedclothes. They were all crumpled up.
She looked at Rose. Her eyes were very bright and her cheeks were
flushed. What was the matter? Had they woken her, moving about
downstairs in Mama's room?

"What's been keeping you awake?" she asked. Rose yawned again; but
it was a sigh rather than a yawn. She could not tell Eleanor what
she had seen. She had a profound feeling of guilt; for some reason
she must lie about the face she had seen.

"I had a bad dream," she said. "I was frightened." A queer
nervous jerk ran through her body as she sat up in bed. What was
the matter? Eleanor wondered, again. Had she been fighting with
Martin? Had she been chasing cats in Miss Pym's garden again?

"Have you been chasing cats again?" she asked. "Poor cats," she
added; "they mind it just as much as you would," she said. But she
knew that Rose's fright had nothing to do with the cats. She was
grasping her finger tightly; she was staring ahead of her with a
queer look in her eyes.

"What was your dream about?" she asked, sitting down on the edge of
the bed. Rose stared at her; she could not tell her; but at all
costs Eleanor must be made to stay with her.

"I thought I heard a man in the room," she brought out at last. "A
robber," she added.

"A robber? Here?" said Eleanor. "But Rose, how could a robber get
into your nursery? There's Papa, there's Morris - they would never
let a robber come into your room."

"No," said Rose. "Papa would kill him," she added. There was
something queer about the way she twitched.

"But what are you all doing?" she said restlessly. "Haven't  you
gone to bed yet? Isn't  it very late?"

"What are we all doing?" said Eleanor. "We're sitting in the
drawing-room. It's not very late." As she spoke a faint sound
boomed through the room. When the wind was in the right direction
they could hear St. Paul's. The soft circles spread out in the
air: one, two, three, four - Eleanor counted eight, nine, ten. She
was surprised that the strokes stopped so soon.

"There, it's only ten o'clock, you see," she said. It had seemed
to her much later. But the last stroke dissolved in the air. "So
now you'll go to sleep," she said. Rose clutched her hand.

"Don't  go, Eleanor; not yet," she implored her.

"But tell me, what's frightened you?" Eleanor began. Something was
being hidden from her, she was sure.

"I saw . . ." Rose began. She made a great effort to tell her the
truth; to tell her about the man at the pillar-box. "I saw . . ."
she repeated. But here the door opened and Nurse came in.

"I don't  know what's come over Rosie tonight," she said, bustling
in. She felt a little guilty; she had stayed downstairs with the
other servants gossiping about the mistress.

"She sleeps so sound generally," she said, coming over to the bed.

"Now, here's Nurse," said Eleanor. "She's coming to bed. So you
won't  be frightened any more, will you?" She smoothed down the
bed-clothes and kissed her. She got up and took her candle.

"Good-night, Nurse," she said, turning to leave the room.

"Good-night, Miss Eleanor," said Nurse, putting some sympathy into
her voice; for they were saying downstairs that the mistress
couldn't  last much longer.

"Turn over and go to sleep, dearie," she said, kissing Rose on the
forehead. For she was sorry for the little girl who would so soon
be motherless. Then she slipped the silver links out of her cuffs
and began to take the hairpins out of her hair, standing in her
petticoats in front of the yellow chest of drawers.



"I saw," Eleanor repeated, as she shut the nursery door. "I
saw . . ." What had she seen? Something horrible, something
hidden. But what? There it was, hidden behind her strained eyes.
She held the candle slightly slanting in her hand. Three drops of
grease fell on the polished skirting before she noticed them. She
straightened the candle and walked down the stairs. She listened
as she went. There was silence. Martin was asleep. Her mother
was asleep. As she passed the doors and went downstairs a weight
seemed to descend on her. She paused, looking down into the hall.
A blankness came over her. Where am I? she asked herself, staring
at a heavy frame. What is that? She seemed to be alone in the
midst of nothingness; yet must descend, must carry her burden - she
raised her arms slightly, as if she were carrying a pitcher, an
earthenware pitcher on her head. Again she stopped. The rim of a
bowl outlined itself upon her eyeballs; there was water in it; and
something yellow. It was the dog's bowl, she realised; that was
the sulphur in the dog's bowl; the dog was lying curled up at the
bottom of the stairs. She stepped carefully over the body of the
sleeping dog and went into the drawing-room.



They all looked up as she came in; Morris had a book in his hand
but he was not reading; Milly had some stuff in her hand but she
was not sewing; Delia was lying back in her chair, doing nothing
whatever. She stood there hesitating for a moment. Then she
turned to the writing-table. "I'll write to Edward," she murmured.
She took up the pen, but she hesitated. She found it difficult to
write to Edward, seeing him before her, when she took up the pen,
when she smoothed the notepaper on the writing-table. His eyes
were too close together; he brushed up his crest before the
looking-glass in the lobby in a way that irritated her. 'Nigs' was
her nickname for him. "My dear Edward," she began to write,
choosing 'Edward' not 'Nigs' on this occasion.

Morris looked up from the book he was trying to read. The
scratching of Eleanor's pen irritated him. She stopped; then she
wrote; then she put her hand to her head. All the worries were put
on her of course. Still she irritated him. She always asked
questions; she never listened to the answers. He glanced at his
book again. But what was the use of trying to read? The
atmosphere of suppressed emotion was distasteful to him. There was
nothing that anybody could do, but there they all sat in attitudes
of suppressed emotion. Milly's stitching irritated him, and Delia
lying back in her chair doing nothing as usual. There he was
cooped up with all these women in an atmosphere of unreal emotion.
And Eleanor went on writing, writing, writing. There was nothing
to write about - but here she licked the envelope and dabbed down
the stamp.



"Shall I take it?" he said, dropping his book.

He got up as if he were glad to have something to do. Eleanor went
to the front door with him and stood holding it open while he went
to the pillar-box. It was raining gently, and as she stood at the
door, breathing in the mild damp air, she watched the curious
shadows that trembled on the pavement under the trees. Morris
disappeared under the shadows round the corner. She remembered how
she used to stand at the door when he was a small boy and went to a
day school with a satchel in his hand. She used to wave to him;
and when he got to the corner he always turned and waved back. It
was a curious little ceremony, dropped now that they were both
grown up. The shadows shook as she stood waiting; in a moment he
emerged from the shadows. He came along the street and up the
steps.

"He'll get that tomorrow," he said - "anyhow by the second post."

He shut the door and stooped to fasten the chain. It seemed to
her, as the chain rattled, that they both accepted the fact that
nothing more was going to happen tonight. They avoided each
other's eyes; neither of them wanted any more emotion tonight.
They went back into the drawing-room.

"Well," said Eleanor, looking round her, "I think I shall go to
bed. Nurse will ring," she said, "if she wants anything."

"We may as well all go," said Morris. Milly began to roll up her
embroidery. Morris began to rake out the fire.

"What an absurd fire - " he exclaimed irritably. The coals were all
stuck together. They were blazing fiercely.

Suddenly a bell rang.

"Nurse!" Eleanor exclaimed. She looked at Morris. She left the
room hurriedly. Morris followed her.

But what's the good? Delia thought to herself. It's only another
false alarm. She got up. "It's only Nurse," she said to Milly,
who was standing up with a look of alarm on her face. She can't  be
going to cry again, she thought, and strolled off into the front
room. Candles were burning on the mantelpiece; they lit up the
picture of her mother. She glanced at the portrait of her mother.
The girl in white seemed to be presiding over the protracted affair
of her own deathbed with a smiling indifference that outraged her
daughter.

"You're not going to die - you're not going to die!" said Delia
bitterly, looking up at her. Her father, alarmed by the bell, had
come into the room. He was wearing a red smoking-cap with an
absurd tassel.

But it's all for nothing, Delia said silently, looking at her
father. She felt that they must both check their rising
excitement. "Nothing's going to happen - nothing whatever," she
said, looking at him. But at that moment Eleanor came into the
room. She was very white.

"Where's Papa?" she said, looking round. She saw him. "Come,
Papa, come," she said, stretching out her hand. "Mama's dying. . . .
And the children," she said to Milly over her shoulder.

Two little white patches appeared above her father's ears, Delia
noticed. His eyes fixed themselves. He braced himself. He strode
past them up the stairs. They all followed in a little procession
behind. The dog, Delia noticed, tried to come upstairs with them;
but Morris cuffed him back. The Colonel went first into the
bedroom; then Eleanor; then Morris; then Martin came down, pulling
on a dressing-gown; then Milly brought Rose wrapped in a shawl.
But Delia hung back behind the others. There were so many of them
in the room that she could get no further than the doorway. She
could see two nurses standing with their backs to the wall
opposite. One of them was crying - the one, she observed, who had
only come that afternoon. She could not see the bed from where she
stood. But she could see that Morris had fallen on his knees.
Ought I to kneel too? she wondered. Not in the passage, she
decided. She looked away; she saw the little window at the end of
the passage. Rain was falling; there was a light somewhere that
made the raindrops shine. One drop after another slid down the
pane; they slid and they paused; one drop joined another drop and
then they slid again. There was complete silence in the bedroom.

Is this death? Delia asked herself. For a moment there seemed to
be something there. A wall of water seemed to gape apart; the two
walls held themselves apart. She listened. There was complete
silence. Then there was a stir, a shuffle of feet in the bedroom
and out came her father, stumbling.

"Rose!" he cried. "Rose! Rose!" He held his arms with the fists
clenched out in front of him.

You did that very well, Delia told him as he passed her. It was
like a scene in a play. She observed quite dispassionately that
the raindrops were still falling. One sliding met another and
together in one drop they rolled to the bottom of the window-pane.



It was raining. A fine rain, a gentle shower, was peppering the
pavements and making them greasy. Was it worth while opening an
umbrella, was it necessary to hail a hansom, people coming out from
the theatres asked themselves, looking up at the mild, milky sky in
which the stars were blunted. Where it fell on earth, on fields
and gardens, it drew up the smell of earth. Here a drop poised on
a grass-blade; there filled the cup of a wild flower, till the
breeze stirred and the rain was spilt. Was it worth while to
shelter under the hawthorn, under the hedge, the sheep seemed to
question; and the cows, already turned out in the grey fields,
under the dim hedges, munched on, sleepily chewing with raindrops
on their hides. Down on the roofs it fell - here in Westminster,
there in the Ladbroke Grove; on the wide sea a million points
pricked the blue monster like an innumerable shower bath. Over the
vast domes, the soaring spires of slumbering University cities,
over the leaded libraries, and the museums, now shrouded in brown
holland, the gentle rain slid down, till, reaching the mouths of
those fantastic laughers, the many-clawed gargoyles, it splayed out
in a thousand odd indentations. A drunken man slipping in a narrow
passage outside the public house, cursed it. Women in childbirth
heard the doctor say to the midwife, "It's raining." And the
walloping Oxford bells, turning over and over like slow porpoises
in a sea of oil, contemplatively intoned their musical incantation.
The fine rain, the gentle rain, poured equally over the mitred and
the bareheaded with an impartiality which suggested that the god of
rain, if there were a god, was thinking Let it not be restricted to
the very wise, the very great, but let all breathing kind, the
munchers and chewers, the ignorant, the unhappy, those who toil in
the furnace making innumerable copies of the same pot, those who
bore red hot minds through contorted letters, and also Mrs Jones in
the alley, share my bounty.



It was raining in Oxford. The rain fell gently, persistently,
making a little chuckling and burbling noise in the gutters.
Edward, leaning out of the window, could still see the trees in the
college garden, whitened by the falling rain. Save for the rustle
of the trees and the rain falling, it was perfectly quiet. A damp,
earthy smell came up from the wet ground. Lamps were being lit
here and there in the dark mass of the college; and there was a
pale-yellowish mound in one corner where lamplight fell upon a
flowering tree. The grass was becoming invisible, fluid, grey,
like water.

He drew in a long breath of satisfaction. Of all the moments in
the day he liked this best, when he stood and looked out into the
garden. He breathed in again the cool damp air, and then
straightened himself and turned back into the room. He was working
very hard. His day was parcelled out on the advice of his tutor
into hours and half-hours; but he still had five minutes before he
need begin. He turned up the reading-lamp. It was partly the
green light that made him look a little pale and thin, but he was
very handsome. With his clear-cut features and the fair hair that
he brushed up with a flick of his fingers into a crest, he looked
like a Greek boy on a frieze. He smiled. He was thinking as he
watched the rain how, after the interview between his father and
his tutor - when old Harbottle had said "Your son has a chance" - the
old boy had insisted upon looking up the rooms that his own father
had had when his father was at college. They had burst in and
found a chap called Thompson on his knees blowing up the fire with
a bellows.

"My father had these rooms, sir," the Colonel had said, by way of
apology. The young man had got very red and said, "Don't  mention
it." Edward smiled. "Don't  mention it," he repeated. It was time
to begin. He turned the lamp a little higher. When the lamp was
turned higher he saw his work cut out in a sharp circle of bright
light from the surrounding dimness. He looked at the textbooks, at
the dictionaries lying before him. He always had some doubts
before he began. His father would be frightfully cut-up if he
failed. His heart was set on it. He had sent him a dozen of fine
old port "by way of a stirrup-cup," so he said. But after all
Marsham was in for it; then there was the clever little Jew-boy
from Birmingham - but it was time to begin. One after another the
bells of Oxford began pushing their slow chimes through the air.
They tolled ponderously, unequally, as if they had to roll the air
out of their way and the air was heavy. He loved the sound of the
bells. He listened till the last stroke had struck; then pulled
his chair to the table; time was up; he must work now.

A little dint sharpened between his brows. He frowned as he read.
He read; and made a note; then he read again. All sounds were
blotted out. He saw nothing but the Greek in front of him. But as
he read, his brain gradually warmed; he was conscious of something
quickening and tightening in his forehead. He caught phrase after
phrase exactly, firmly, more exactly, he noted, making a brief note
in the margin, than the night before. Little negligible words now
revealed shade of meaning which altered the meaning. He made
another note; THAT was the meaning. His own dexterity in catching
the phrase plumb in the middle gave him a thrill of excitement.
There it was, clean and entire. But he must be precise; exact;
even his little scribbled notes must be clear as print. He turned
to this book; then that book. Then he leant back to see, with his
eyes shut. He must let nothing dwindle off into vagueness. The
clocks began striking. He listened. The clocks went on striking.
The lines that had graved themselves on his face slackened; he
leant back; his muscles relaxed; he looked up from his books into
the dimness. He felt as if he had thrown himself down on the turf
after running a race. But for a moment it seemed to him that he
was still running; his mind went on without the book. It travelled
by itself without impediments through a world of pure meaning; but
gradually it lost its meaning. The books stood out on the wall: he
saw the cream-coloured panels; a bunch of poppies in a blue vase.
The last of the strokes had sounded. He gave a sigh and rose from
the table.

He stood by the window again. It was raining, but the whiteness
had gone. Save for a wet leaf shining here and there, the garden
was all dark now - the yellow mound of the flowering tree had
vanished. The college buildings lay round the garden in a low
couched mass, here red-stained, here yellow-stained, where lights
burnt behind curtains; and there lay the chapel, huddling its bulk
against the sky which, because of the rain, seemed to tremble
slightly. But it was no longer silent. He listened; there was no
sound in particular; but, as he stood looking out, the building
hummed with life. There was a sudden roar of laughter; then the
tinkle of a piano; then a nondescript clatter and chatter - of china
partly; then again the sound of rain falling, and the gutters
chuckling and burbling as they sucked up the water. He turned back
into the room.

It had grown chilly; the fire was almost out; only a little red
glowed under the grey ash. Opportunely he remembered his father's
gift - the wine that had come that morning. He went to the side
table and poured himself out a glass of port. As he raised it
against the light he smiled. He saw again his father's hand with
two smooth knobs instead of fingers holding the glass, as he always
held the glass, to the light before he drank.

"You can't  drive a bayonet through a chap's body in cold blood," he
remembered him saying.

"And you can't  go in for an exam. without drinking," said Edward.
He hesitated; he held the glass to the light in imitation of his
father. Then he sipped. He set the glass on the table in front of
him. He turned again to the Antigone. He read; then he sipped;
then he read; then he sipped again. A soft glow spread over his
spine at the nape of his neck. The wine seemed to press open
little dividing doors in his brain. And whether it was the wine or
the words or both, a luminous shell formed, a purple fume, from
which out stepped a Greek girl; yet she was English. There she
stood among the marble and the asphodel, yet there she was among
the Morris wall-papers and the cabinets - his cousin Kitty, as he
had seen her last time he dined at the lodge. She was both of
them - Antigone and Kitty; here in the book; there in the room; lit
up, risen, like a purple flower. No, he exclaimed, not in the
least like a flower! For if ever a girl held herself upright,
lived, laughed and breathed, it was Kitty, in the white and blue
dress that she had worn last time he dined at the Lodge. He
crossed to the window. Red squares showed through the trees.
There was a party at the Lodge. Who was she talking to? What was
she saying? He went back to the table.

"Oh, damn!" he exclaimed, prodding the paper with his pencil. The
point broke. Then there was a tap at the door, a sliding tap, not
a commanding tap, the tap of one who passes, not of one who comes
in. He went and opened the door. There on the stair above loomed
the figure of a huge young man who was leaning over the banisters.
"Come in," said Edward.

The huge young man came slowly down the stairs. He was very large.
His eyes, which were prominent, became apprehensive at the sight of
the books on the table. He looked at the books on the table. They
were Greek. But there was wine after all.

Edward poured out wine. Beside Gibbs he looked what Eleanor called
'finicky.' He felt the contrast himself. The hand with which he
lifted his glass was like a girl's beside Gibbs's great red paw.
Gibbs's hand was burnt bright scarlet; it was like a piece of raw
meat.

Hunting was the subject they had in common. They talked about
hunting. Edward leant back and let Gibbs do the talking. It was
all very pleasant, listening to Gibbs, riding through these English
lanes. He was talking about cubbing in September; and a raw but
handy hack. He was saying, "You remember that farm on the right as
you go up to Stapleys? and the pretty girl?" - he winked - "worse
luck, she's married to a keeper." He was saying - Edward watched
him gulping down his port - how he wished this damned summer were
over. Then, again, he was telling the old story about the spaniel
bitch. "You'll come and stop with us in September," he was saying
when the door opened so silently that Gibbs did not hear it, and in
glided another man - quite another man.

It was Ashley who came in. He was the very opposite of Gibbs. He
was neither tall nor short, neither dark nor fair. But he was not
negligible - far from it. It was partly the way he moved, as if
chair and table rayed out some influence which he could feel by
means of some invisible antennae, or whiskers, like a cat. Now he
sank down, cautiously, gingerly, and looked at the table and half
read a line in a book. Gibbs stopped in the middle of his
sentence.

"Hullo, Ashley," he said rather curtly. He stretched out and
poured himself another glass of the Colonel's port. Now the
decanter was empty.

"Sorry," he said, glancing at Ashley.

"Don't  open another bottle for me," said Ashley quickly. His voice
sounded a little squeaky, as if he were ill at ease.

"Oh, but we shall want some more too," said Edward casually. He
went into the dining-room to fetch it.

"Damned awkward," he reflected as he stooped among the bottles. It
meant, he reflected grimly as he chose his bottle, another row with
Ashley, and he had had two rows with Ashley about Gibbs already
this term.

He went back with the bottle and sat down on a low stool between
them. He uncorked the wine and poured it out. They both looked at
him, as he sat between them, admiringly. The vanity, which Eleanor
always laughed at in her brother, was flattered. He liked to feel
their eyes on him. And yet he was at his ease with both of them,
he thought; the thought pleased him; he could talk hunting with
Gibbs and books with Ashley. But Ashley could only talk about
books, and Gibbs - he smiled - could only talk about girls. Girls
and horses. He poured out three glasses of wine.

Ashley sipped gingerly, and Gibbs, with his great red hands on the
glass, gulped rather. They talked about races; then they talked
about examinations. Then Ashley, glancing at the books on the
table, said:

"And what about you?"

"I've  not the ghost of a chance," said Edward. His indifference
was affected. He pretended to despise examinations; but it was
pretence. Gibbs was taken in by him; but Ashley saw through him.
He often caught Edward out in small vanities like this; but they
only served to endear him the more. How beautiful he looks, he was
thinking: there he sat between them with the light falling on the
top of his fair hair; like a Greek boy; strong; yet in some way,
weak, needing his protection.

He ought to be rescued from brutes like Gibbs, he thought savagely.
For how Edward could tolerate that clumsy brute, he thought looking
at him, who always seemed to smell of beer and horses  he was
listening to him  Ashley could not conceive. As he came in he had
caught the tail of an infuriating sentence - of a sentence that
seemed to show that they had made some plan together.

"Well, then, I'll see Storey about that hack," Gibbs was saying
now, as if he were finishing some private talk that they had been
having before he came in. A spasm of jealousy ran through Ashley.
To hide it, he stretched out his hand and took up a book that lay
open on the table. He pretended to read it.

He did it to insult him, Gibbs felt. Ashley, he knew, thought him
a great hulking brute; the dirty little swine came in, spoilt the
talk, and then began to give himself airs at Gibbs's expense. Very
well; he had been going to go; now he would stay; he would twist
his tail for him - he knew how. He turned to Edward and went on
talking.

"You won't  mind pigging it," he said. "My people will be up in
Scotland."

Ashley turned a page viciously. They would be alone then. Edward
began to relish the situation; he played up to it maliciously.

"All right," he said. "But you'll have to see I don't  make a fool
of myself," he added.

"Oh, it'll only be cubbing," said Gibbs. Ashley turned another
page. Edward glanced at the book. It was being held upside down.
But as he glanced at Ashley he caught his head against the panels
and the poppies. How civilised he looked, he thought, compared
with Gibbs; and how ironical. He respected him immensely. Gibbs
had lost his glamour. There he was, telling the same old story of
the spaniel bitch all over again. There would be a devil's own row
tomorrow, he thought, and glanced surreptitiously at his watch. It
was past eleven; and he must do an hour's work before breakfast.
He swallowed down the last drops of his wine, stretched himself,
yawned ostentatiously and rose.

"I'm off to bed," he said. Ashley looked at him appealingly.
Edward could torture him horribly. Edward began unbuttoning his
waistcoat; he had a perfect figure, Ashley thought, looking at him,
standing between them.

"But don't  you hurry" said Edward, yawning again. "Finish your
drinks." He smiled at the thought of Ashley and Gibbs finishing
their drinks together.

"There's plenty more in there if you want it." He indicated the
next room and left them.

"Let 'em fight it out together," he thought as he shut the bedroom
door. His own fight would come soon enough; he knew that from the
look on Ashley's face. He was infernally jealous. He began to
undress. He put his money methodically in two heaps on either side
of the looking-glass, for he was a little near about money; folded
his waistcoat carefully on a chair; then glanced at himself in the
looking-glass, and brushed his crest up with the half-conscious
gesture that irritated his sister. Then he listened.

A door slammed outside. One of them had gone - either Gibbs or
Ashley. But one, he rather thought, was still there. He listened
intently. He heard someone moving about in the sitting-room. Very
quickly, very firmly, he turned the key in the door. A moment
later the handle moved.

"Edward!" said Ashley. His voice was low and controlled.

Edward made no answer.

"Edward!" said Ashley, rattling the handle.

The voice was sharp and appealing.

"Good-night," said Edward sharply. He listened. There was a
pause. Then he heard the door shut. Ashley was gone.

"Lord! What a row there'll be tomorrow," said Edward, going to the
window and looking out at the rain that was still falling.



The party at the Lodge was over. The ladies stood in the doorway
in their flowing gowns, and looked up at the sky from which a
gentle rain was falling.

"Is that a nightingale?" said Mrs Larpent, hearing a bird twitter
in the bushes. Then old Chuffy - the great Dr. Andrews - standing
slightly behind her with his domed head exposed to the drizzle and
his hirsute, powerful but not prepossessing countenance turned
upward, gave a roar of laughter. It was a thrush, he said. The
laughter was echoed back like a hyena laughing from the stone
walls. Then, with a wave of the hand dictated by centuries of
tradition, Mrs Larpent drew back her foot, as if she had encroached
upon one of the chalk marks which decorate academic lintels and,
signifying that Mrs Lathom, wife of the Divinity professor, should
precede her, they passed out into the rain.



In the long drawing-room at the Lodge they were all standing up.

"I'm so glad Chuffy - Dr. Andrews - came up to your expectations,"
Mrs Malone was saying in her courteous manner. As residents they
called the great Doctor "Chuffy"; he was Dr. Andrews to American
visitors.

The other guests had gone. But the Howard Fripps, the Americans,
were staying in the house. Mrs Howard Fripp was saying that Dr.
Andrews had been perfectly charming to her. And her husband, the
Professor, was saying something equally polite to the Master.
Kitty, the daughter, standing a little in the background, wished
that they would get it over and come to bed. But she had to stand
there until her mother gave the signal for them to move.

"Yes, I never knew Chuffy in better form," her father continued,
implying a compliment to the little American lady who had made such
a conquest. She was small and vivacious, and Chuffy liked ladies
to be small and vivacious.

"I adore his books," she said in her queer nasal voice. "But I
never expected to have the pleasure of sitting next him at dinner."

Did you really like the way he spits when he talks? Kitty wondered,
looking at her. She was extraordinarily pretty and gay. All the
other women had looked dowdy and dumpy beside her, except her
mother. For Mrs Malone, standing by the fireplace with her foot on
the fender, with her crisp white hair curled stiffly, never looked
in the fashion or out of it. Mrs Fripp, on the contrary, looked in
the fashion.

And yet they laughed at her, Kitty thought. She had caught the
Oxford ladies lifting their eyebrows at some of Mrs Fripp's
American phrases. But Kitty liked her American phrases; they were
so different from what she was used to. She was American, a real
American; but nobody would have taken her husband for an American,
Kitty thought, looking at him. He might have been any professor,
from any University, she thought, with his distinguished wrinkled
face, his goatee beard and the black ribbon of his eyeglass
crossing his shirt-front as if it were some foreign order. He
spoke without any accent - at least without any American accent.
Yet he too was different somehow. She had dropped her handkerchief.
He stooped at once and gave it her with a bow that was almost too
courteous - it made her shy. She bent her head and smiled at the
Professor, rather shyly, as she took the handkerchief.

"Thank you so much," she said. He made her feel awkward. Beside
Mrs Fripp she felt even larger than usual. Her hair, of the true
Rigby red, never lay smooth as it should have done; Mrs Fripp's
hair looked beautiful, glossy and tidy.

But now Mrs Malone, glancing at Mrs Fripp, said, "Well, ladies - ?"
and waved her hand.

There was something authoritative about her action - as if she had
done it again and again; and been obeyed again and again. They
moved towards the door. Tonight there was a little ceremony at the
door; Professor Fripp bent very low over Mrs Malone's hand, not
quite so low over Kitty's hand, and held the door wide open for
them.

"He rather overdoes it," Kitty thought to herself as they passed
out.

The ladies took their candles and went in single file up the wide
low stairs. Portraits of former masters of Katharine's looked down
on them as they mounted. The light of the candles flickered over
the dark gold-framed faces as they went up stair after stair.

Now she'll stop, thought Kitty, following behind, and ask who THAT
is.

But Mrs Fripp did not stop. Kitty gave her good marks for that.
She compared favourably with most of their visitors, Kitty thought.
She had never done the Bodleian quite so quick as she had done it
that morning. Indeed, she had felt rather guilty. There were a
great many more sights to be seen, had they wished it. But in less
than an hour of it Mrs Fripp had turned to Kitty and had said in
her fascinating, if nasal, voice:

"Well, my dear, I guess you're a bit fed-up with sights - what d'you
say to an ice in that dear old bun-shop with the bow windows?"

And they had eaten ices when they ought to have been going round
the Bodleian.

The procession had now reached the first landing, and Mrs Malone
stopped at the door of the famous room where distinguished guests
always slept when they stayed at the Lodge. She gave one look
round as she held the door open.

"The bed where Queen Elizabeth did NOT sleep," she said, making the
usual little joke as they looked at the great four-poster. The
fire was burning; the water-jug was swaddled up like an old woman
with the toothache; and the candles were lit on the dressing-table.
But there was something strange about the room tonight, Kitty
thought, glancing over her mother's shoulder; a dressing-gown
flashed green and silver upon the bed. And on the dressing-table
there were a number of little pots and jars and a large powder-puff
stained pink. Could it be, was it possible, that the reason why
Mrs Fripp looked so very bright and the Oxford ladies looked so
very dingy was that Mrs Fripp - But Mrs Malone was saying, "You have
everything you want?" with such extreme politeness that Kitty
guessed that Mrs Malone too had seen the dressing-table. Kitty
held out her hand. To her surprise, instead of taking it, Mrs
Fripp pulled her down and kissed her.

"Thanks a thousand times for showing me all those sights," she
said. "And remember, you're coming to stay with us in America,"
she added. For she had liked the big shy girl who had so obviously
preferred eating ices to showing her the Bodleian; and she had felt
sorry for her too for some reason.

"Good-night, Kitty," said her mother as she shut the door; and they
touched each other perfunctorily on the cheek.



Kitty went on upstairs to her own room. She still felt the spot
where Mrs Fripp had kissed her; the kiss had left a little glow on
her cheek.

She shut the door. The room was very stuffy. It was a warm night,
but they always shut the windows and drew the curtains. She opened
the windows and drew the curtains. It was raining as usual.
Arrows of silver rain crossed the dark trees in the garden. Then
she kicked off her shoes. That was the worst of being so large - 
shoes were always too tight; white satin shoes in particular. Then
she began to unhook her dress. It was difficult; there were so
many hooks and all at the back; but at last the white satin dress
was off and laid neatly across the chair; and then she began to
brush her hair. It had been Thursday at its very worst, she
reflected; sights in the morning; people for lunch; undergraduates
for tea; and a dinner-party in the evening.

However, she concluded, tugging the comb through her hair, it's
over . . . it's over.

The candles flickered and then the muslin blind, blowing out in a
white balloon, almost touched the flame. She opened her eyes with
a start. She was standing at the open window with a light beside
her in her petticoat.

"Anybody might see in," her mother had said, scolding her only the
other day.

Now, she said, moving the candle to a table at the right, nobody
can see in.

She began to brush her hair again. But with the light at the side
instead of in front she saw her face from a different angle.

Am I pretty? she asked herself, putting down her comb and looking
in the glass. Her cheek-bones were too prominent; her eyes were
set too far apart. She was not pretty; no, her size was against
her. What did Mrs Fripp think of me, she wondered?

She kissed me, she suddenly remembered with a start of pleasure,
feeling again the glow on her cheek. She asked me to go with them
in America. What fun that would be! she thought. What fun to
leave Oxford and go to America! She tugged the comb through her
hair, which was like a fuzz bush.

But the bells were making their usual commotion. She hated the
sound of the bells; it always seemed to her a dismal sound; and
then, just as one stopped, here was another beginning. They went
walloping one over another, one after another, as if they would
never be finished. She counted eleven, twelve, and then they went
on thirteen, fourteen . . . clock repeating clock through the damp,
drizzling air. It was late. She began to brush her teeth. She
glanced at the calendar above the washstand and tore off Thursday
and screwed it into a ball, as if she were saying "That's over!
That's over!" Friday in large red letters confronted her. Friday
was a good day; on Friday she had her lesson with Lucy; she was
going to tea with the Robsons. "Blessed is he who has found his
work" she read on the calendar. Calendars always seemed to be
talking at you. She had not done her work. She glanced at a row
of blue volumes, "The Constitutional History of England, by Dr.
Andrews." There was a paper slip in volume three. She should have
finished her chapter for Lucy; but not tonight. She was too tired
tonight. She turned to the window. A roar of laughter floated out
from the undergraduates' quarters. What are they laughing at, she
wondered as she stood by the window. It sounded as if they were
enjoying themselves. They never laugh like that when they come to
tea at the Lodge, she thought, as the laughter died away. The
little man from Balliol sat twisting his fingers, twisting his
fingers. He would not talk; but he would not go. Then she blew
out the candle and got into bed. I rather like him, she thought,
stretching out in the cool sheets, though he twists his fingers.
As for Tony Ashton, she thought, turning on her pillow, I don't 
like him. He always seemed to be cross-examining her about Edward,
whom Eleanor, she thought, calls 'Nigs'. His eyes were too close
together. A bit of a barber's block, she thought. He had followed
her at the picnic the other day - the picnic when the ant got into
Mrs Lathom's skirts. There he was always beside her. But she
didn't  want to marry him. She didn't  want to be a Don's wife and
live in Oxford for ever. No, no, no! She yawned, turned on her
pillow, and listening to a belated bell that went walloping like a
slow porpoise through the thick drizzling air, yawned once more and
fell asleep.



The rain fell steadily all night long, making a faint mist over the
fields, chuckling and burbling in the gutters. In gardens it fell
over flowering bushes of lilac and laburnum. It slipped gently
over the leaden domes of libraries, and splayed out of the laughing
mouths of gargoyles. It smeared the window where the Jew boy from
Birmingham sat mugging up Greek with a wet towel round his head;
where Dr. Malone sat up late writing another chapter in his
monumental history of the college. And in the garden of the Lodge
outside Kitty's window it sluiced the ancient tree under which
Kings and poets had sat drinking three centuries ago, but now it
was half fallen and had to be propped up by a stake in the middle.



"Umbrella, Miss?" said Hiscock, offering Kitty an umbrella as she
left the house rather later than she should have left it the
following afternoon. There was a chilliness in the air which made
her glad, as she caught sight of a party with white and yellow
frocks and cushions bound for the river, that she was not going to
sit in a boat today. No parties today, she thought, no parties
today. But she was late, the clock warned her.

She strode along until she came to the cheap red villas that her
father disliked so much that he would always make a round to avoid
them. But as it was in one of these cheap red villas that Miss
Craddock lived, Kitty saw them haloed with romance. Her heart beat
faster as she turned the corner by the new chapel and saw the steep
steps of the house where Miss Craddock actually lived. Lucy went
up those steps and down them every day; that was her window; this
was her bell. The bell came out with a jerk when she pulled it;
but it did not go back again, for everything was ramshackle in
Lucy's house; but everything was romantic. There was Lucy's
umbrella in the stand; and it too was not like other umbrellas; it
had a parrot's head for a handle. But as she went up the steep
shiny stairs excitement became mixed with fear: once more she had
scamped her work; she had not "given her mind to it" again this
week.



"She's coming!" thought Miss Craddock, holding her pen suspended.
Her nose was red-tipped; there was something owl-like about the
eyes, round which there was a sallow, hollow depression. There was
the bell. The pen had been dipped in red ink; she had been
correcting Kitty's essay. Now she heard her step on the stairs.
"She's coming!" she thought with a little catch of her breath,
laying down the pen.

"I'm awfully sorry, Miss Craddock," Kitty said, taking off her
things and sitting down at the table. "But we had people staying
in the house."

Miss Craddock brushed her hand over her mouth in a way she had when
she was disappointed.

"I see," she said. "So you haven't  done any work this week
either."

Miss Craddock took up her pen and dipped it in the red ink. Then
she turned to the essay.

"It wasn't  worth correcting," she remarked, pausing with her pen in
the air.

"A child of ten would have been ashamed of it." Kitty blushed
bright red.

"And the odd thing is," said Miss Craddock putting down her pen
when the lesson was over, "that you've  got quite an original mind."

Kitty flushed bright red with pleasure.

"But you don't  use it," said Miss Craddock. "Why don't  you use
it?" she added, looking at her out of her fine grey eyes.

"You see, Miss Craddock," Kitty began eagerly, "my mother - "

"Hm . . . hm . . . hm . . ." Miss Craddock stopped her.
Confidences were not what Dr. Malone paid her for. She got up.

"Look at my flowers," she said, feeling that she had snubbed her
too severely. There was a bowl of flowers on the table; wild
flowers, blue and white, stuck into a cushion of wet green moss.

"My sister sent them from the moors," she said.

"The moors?" said Kitty. "Which moors?" She stooped and touched
the little flowers tenderly. How lovely she is, Miss Craddock
thought; for she was sentimental about Kitty. But I will not be
sentimental, she told herself.

"The Scarborough moors," she said aloud. "If you keep the moss
damp but not too damp, they'll last for weeks," she added, looking
at the flowers.

"Damp, but not too damp," Kitty smiled. "That's easy in Oxford, I
should think. It's always raining here." She looked at the
window. Mild rain was falling.

"If I lived up there, Miss Craddock - " she began, taking her
umbrella. But she stopped. The lesson was over.

"You'd find it very dull," said Miss Craddock, looking at her. She
was putting on her cloak. Certainly she looked very lovely,
putting on her cloak.

"When I was your age," Miss Craddock continued, remembering her
r"le as teacher, "I would have given my eyes to have the
opportunities you have, to meet the people you meet; to know the
people you know."

"Old Chuffy?" said Kitty, remembering Miss Craddock's profound
admiration for that light of learning.

"You irreverent girl!" Miss Craddock expostulated. "The greatest
historian of his age!"

"Well, he doesn't  talk history to me," said Kitty, remembering the
damp feel of a heavy hand on her knee.

She hesitated; but the lesson was over; another pupil was coming.
She glanced round the room. There was a plate of oranges on the
top of a pile of shiny exercise-books: a box that looked as if it
contained biscuits. Was this her only room, she wondered? Did she
sleep on the lumpy-looking sofa with the shawl thrown over it?
There was no looking-glass, and she stuck her hat on rather to one
side, thinking as she did so that Miss Craddock despised clothes.

But Miss Craddock was thinking how wonderful it was to be young and
lovely and to meet brilliant men.

"I'm going to tea with the Robsons," said Kitty, holding out her
hand. The girl, Nelly Robson, was Miss Craddock's favourite pupil;
the only girl, she used to say, who knew what work meant.

"Are you walking?" said Miss Craddock, looking at her clothes.
"It's some way, you know. Down Ringmer Road, past the gasworks."

"Yes, I'm walking," said Kitty, shaking hands.

"And I will try to work hard this week," she said, looking down on
her with eyes full of love and admiration. Then she descended the
steep stairs whose oilcloth shone bright with romance; and glanced
at the umbrella that had a parrot for handle.



The son of the Professor, who had done it all off his own bat, "a
most creditable performance", to quote Dr. Malone, was mending the
hen coops in the back garden at Prestwich Terrace - a scratched up
little place. Hammer, hammer, hammer, he went, fixing a board to
the rotten roof. His hands were white, unlike his father's, and
long fingered too. He had no love of doing these jobs himself.
But his father mended the boots on Sunday. Down came the hammer.
He went at it, hammering the long shiny nails that sometimes split
the wood, or drove outside. For it was rotten. He hated hens too,
imbecile fowls, a huddle of feathers, watching him out of their red
beady eyes. They scratched up the path; left little curls of
feather here and there on the beds, which were more to his fancy.
But nothing grew there. How grow flowers like other people if one
kept hens? A bell rang.

"Curse it! There's some old woman come to tea," he said, holding
his hammer suspended; and then brought it down on the nail.



As she stood on the step, noting the cheap lace curtains and the
blue and orange glass, Kitty tried to remember what it was that her
father had said about Nelly's father. But a little maid let her
in. I'm much too large, Kitty thought, as she stood for a moment
in the room to which the maid had admitted her. It was a small
room, crowded with objects. And I'm too well dressed she thought,
looking at herself in the glass over the fireplace. But here her
friend Nelly came in. She was dumpy; over her large grey eyes she
wore steel spectacles, and her brown holland overall seemed to
increase her air of uncompromising veracity.

"We're having tea in the back room," she said, looking her up and
down. What has she been doing? Why is she dressed in an overall?
Kitty thought, following her into the room where tea had already
begun.

"Pleased to see you," said Mrs Robson formally, looking over her
shoulder. But nobody seemed in the least pleased to see her. Two
children were already eating. Slices of bread and butter were in
their hands, but they stayed the bread and butter and stared at
Kitty as she sat down.

She seemed to see the whole room at once. It was bare yet crowded.
The table was too large; there were hard green-plush chairs; yet
the table-cloth was coarse; darned in the middle; and the china was
cheap with its florid red roses. The light was extraordinarily
bright in her eyes. A sound of hammering came in from the garden
outside. She looked at the garden; it was a scratched-up, earthy
garden without flower-beds; and there was a shed at the end of the
garden from which the sound of hammering came.

They're all so short too, Kitty thought, glancing at Mrs Robson.
Only her shoulders came above the tea things; but her shoulders
were substantial. She was a little like Bigge, the cook at the
Lodge, but more formidable. She gave one brief look at Mrs Robson
and then began to pull off her gloves secretly, swiftly, under the
cover of the table-cloth. But why does nobody talk? she thought
nervously. The children kept their eyes fixed upon her with a look
of solemn amazement. Their owl-like stare went up and down over
her uncompromisingly. Happily before they could express their
disapproval, Mrs Robson told them sharply to go on with their tea;
and the bread and butter slowly rose to their mouths again.

Why don't  they say something? Kitty thought again, glancing at
Nelly. She was about to speak when an umbrella grated in the hall;
and Mrs Robson looked up and said to her daughter:

"There's Dad!"

Next moment in trotted a little man, who was so short that he
looked as if his jacket should have been an Eton jacket, and his
collar a round collar. He wore, too, a very thick watch-chain,
made of silver, like a schoolboy's. But his eyes were keen and
fierce, his moustache bristly, and he spoke with a curious accent.

"Pleased to see you," he said, and gripped her hand hard in his.
He sat down, tucked a napkin under his chin so that it obscured his
heavy silver watch-chain under its stiff white shield. Hammer,
hammer, hammer came from the shed in the garden.

"Tell Jo tea's on the table," said Mrs Robson to Nelly, who had
brought in a dish with a cover on it. The cover was removed.
Actually they were going to eat fried fish and potatoes at tea-
time, Kitty remarked.

But Mr Robson had turned his rather alarming blue eyes upon her.
She expected him to say, "How is your father, Miss Malone?"

But he said:

"You're reading history with Lucy Craddock?"

"Yes," she said. She liked the way he said Lucy Craddock, as if he
respected her. So many of the Dons sneered at her. She liked
feeling too, as he made her feel, that she was nobody's daughter in
particular.

"You're interested in history?" he said, applying himself to his
fish and potatoes.

"I love it," she said. His bright blue eyes, gazing straight at
her rather fiercely, seemed to make her say quite shortly what she
meant.

"But I'm frightfully lazy," she added. Here Mrs Robson looked at
her rather sternly, and handed her a thick slice of bread on the
point of a knife.

Anyhow their taste is awful, she said by way of revenge for the
snub that she felt was intended. She focussed her eyes on a
picture opposite - an oily landscape in a heavy gilt frame. There
was a blue and red Japanese plate on either side of it. Everything
was ugly, especially the pictures.

"The moor at the back of our house," said Mr Robson, seeing her
look at a picture.

It struck Kitty that the accent with which he spoke was a Yorkshire
accent. In looking at the picture he had increased his accent.

"In Yorkshire?" she said. "We come from there too. My mother's
family I mean," she added.

"Your mother's family?" said Mr Robson.

"Rigby," she said, and blushed slightly.

"Rigby?" said Mrs Robson, looking up.

"I wur-r-rked for a Miss Rigby before I married."

What sort of wur-r-rk had Mrs Robson done? Kitty wondered. Sam
explained.

"My wife was a cook, Miss Malone, before we married," he said.
Again he increased his accent as if he were proud of it. I had a
great-uncle who rode in a circus, she felt inclined to say: and an
Aunt who married . . . but here Mrs Robson interrupted her.

"The Hollies," she said. "Two very old ladies; Miss Ann and Miss
Matilda." She spoke more gently.

"But they must be dead long ago," she concluded. For the first
time she leant back in her chair and stirred her tea, just as old
Snap at the farm, Kitty thought, stirred her tea round and round
and round.

"Tell Jo we're not sparing the cake," said Mr Robson, cutting
himself a slice of that craggy-looking object; and Nell went out of
the room once more. The hammering stopped in the garden. The door
opened. Kitty, who had altered the focus of her eyes to suit the
smallness of the Robson family, was taken by surprise. The young
man seemed immense in that little room. He was a handsome young
man. He brushed his hand through his hair as came in, for a wood
shaving had stuck in it.

"Our Jo," said Mrs Robson, introducing them. "Go and get the
kittle, Jo," she added; and he went at once as if he were used to
it. When he came back with the kettle, Sam began chaffing him
about a hencoop.

"It takes you a long time, my son, to mend a hencoop," he said.
There was some family joke which Kitty could not follow about
mending boots and hencoops. She watched him eating steadily under
his father's banter. He was not Eton or Harrow, or Rugby or
Winchester; or reading or rowing. He reminded her of Alf, the farm
hand up at Carter's, who had kissed her under the shadow of the
haystack when she was fifteen, and old Carter loomed up leading a
bull with a ring through its nose and said "Stop that!" She looked
down again. She would rather like Jo to kiss her; better than
Edward, she thought to herself suddenly. She remembered her own
appearance, which she had forgotten. She liked him. Yes, she
liked them all very much, she told herself; very much indeed. She
felt as if she had given her nurse the slip and run off on her own.

Then the children began scrambling down off their chairs; the meal
was over. She began to fish under the table for her gloves.

"These them?" said Jo, picking them up off the floor. She took
them and crumpled them up in her hand.

He cast one quick sulky look at her as she stood in the doorway.
She's a stunner, he said to himself, but my word, she gives herself
airs!

Mrs Robson ushered her into the little room where, before tea, she
had looked in the glass. It was crowded with objects. There were
bamboo tables; velvet books with brass hinges; marble gladiators
askew on the mantelpiece and innumerable pictures. . . . But Mrs
Robson, with a gesture that was exactly like Mrs Malone's when she
pointed to the Gainsborough that was not quite certainly a
Gainsborough, was displaying a huge silver salver with an
inscription.

"The salver my husband's pupils gave him," Mrs Robson began,
pointing to the inscription. Kitty began to spell out the
inscription.

"And this . . ." said Mrs Robson, when she had done, pointing to a
document framed like a text on the wall.

But here Sam, who stood in the background fiddling with his watch-
chain, stepped forward and indicated with his stubby forefinger the
picture of an old woman looking rather over life size in the
photographer's chair.

"My mother," he said and stopped. He gave a queer little chuckle.

"Your mother?" Kitty repeated, stooping to look. The unwieldy old
lady, posed in all the stiffness of her best clothes, was plain in
the extreme. And yet Kitty felt that admiration was expected.

"You're very like her, Mr Robson," was all she could find to say.
Indeed they had something of the same sturdy look; the same
piercing eyes; and they were both very plain. He gave an odd
little chuckle.

"Glad you think so," he said. "Brought us all up. Not one of them
a patch on her though." He gave his odd little chuckle again.

Then he turned to his daughter, who had come in and was standing
there in her overall.

"Not a patch on her," he repeated, pinching Nell on the shoulder.
As she stood there with her father's hand on her shoulder under the
portrait of her grandmother, a sudden rush of self-pity came over
Kitty. If she had been the daughter of people like the Robsons,
she thought; if she had lived in the north - but it was clear they
wanted her to go. Nobody ever sat down in this room. They were
all standing up. Nobody pressed her to stay. When she said that
she must go, they all came out into the little hall with her. They
were all about to go on with what they were doing, she felt. Nell
was about to go into the kitchen and wash up the tea things; Jo was
about to return to his hencoops; the children were about to be put
to bed by their mother; and Sam - what was he about to do? She
looked at him standing there with his heavy watch-chain, like a
schoolboy's. You are the nicest man I have ever met, she thought,
holding out her hand.

"Pleased to have made your acquaintance," said Mrs Robson in her
stately way.

"Hope you'll come again soon," said Mr Robson, grasping her hand
very hard.

"Oh, I should love to!" she exclaimed, pressing their hands as hard
as she could. Did they know how much she admired them? she wanted
to say. Would they accept her in spite of her hat and her gloves?
she wanted to ask. But they were all going off to their work. And
I am going home to dress for dinner, she thought as she walked down
the little front steps, pressing her pale kid gloves in her hands.



The sun was shining again; the damp pavements gleamed; a gust of
wind tossed up the wet branches of the almond trees in the villa
gardens; little twigs and tufts of blossom whirled onto the
pavement and stuck there. As she stood still for a second at a
crossing she too seemed to be tossed aloft out of her usual
surroundings. She forgot where she was. The sky, blown into a
blue open space, seemed to be looking down not here upon streets
and houses, but upon open country, where the wind brushed the
moors, and sheep, with grey fleeces ruffled, sheltered under stone
walls. She could almost see the moors brighten and darken as the
clouds passed over them.

But then in two strides the unfamiliar street became the street she
had always known. Here she was again in the paved alley; there
were the old curiosity shops with their blue china and their brass
warming-pans; and next moment she was out in the famous crooked
street with all the domes and steeples. The sun lay in broad
stripes across it. There were the cabs and the awnings and the
book-shops; the old men in black gowns billowing; the young women
in pink and blue dresses flowing; and the young men in straw hats
carrying cushions under their arms. But for a moment all seemed to
her obsolete, frivolous, inane. The usual undergraduate in cap and
gown with books under his arm looked silly. And the portentous old
men with their exaggerated features, looked like gargoyles, carved,
mediaeval, unreal. They were all like people dressed up and acting
parts, she thought. Now she stood at her own door and waited for
Hiscock, the butler, to take his feet off the fender and waddle
upstairs. Why can't  you talk like a human being? she thought, as
he took her umbrella and mumbled his usual remark about the
weather.



Slowly, as if a weight had got into her feet too, she went
upstairs, seeing through open windows and open doors the smooth
lawn, the recumbent tree and the faded chintzes. Down she sank on
the edge of her bed. It was very stuffy. A bluebottle buzzed
round and round; a lawn mower squeaked in the garden below. Far
away pigeons were cooing - Take two coos, Taffy. Take two coos.
Tak. . . . Her eyes half shut. It seemed to her that she was
sitting on the terrace of an Italian inn. There was her father
pressing gentians on to a rough sheet of blotting paper. The lake
below lapped and dazzled. She plucked up courage and said to her
father: "Father . . ." He looked up very kindly over his
spectacles. He held the little blue flower between his thumb and
finger. "I want . . ." she began slipping off the balustrade upon
which she was sitting. But here a bell struck. She rose and
crossed to the washing-table. What would Nell think of this, she
thought, tilting up the beautifully polished brass jug and dipping
her hands in the hot water. Another bell tolled. She crossed to
the dressing-table. The air from the garden outside was full of
murmurings and cooings. Wood shavings, she said as she took up her
brush and comb - he had wood shavings in his hair. A servant passed
with a pile of tin dishes on his head. The pigeons were cooing
Take two coos, Taffy. Take two coos. . . . But there was the
dinner bell. In a moment she had pinned her hair up, hooked her
dress on, and ran down the slippery stairs, sliding her palm along
the banisters as she used to do when she was a child in a hurry.
And there they all were.



Her parents were standing in the hall. A tall man was with them.
His gown was thrown back and one last ray of sunshine lit up his
genial, authoritative face. Who was he? Kitty could not remember.

"My word!" he exclaimed, looking up at her with admiration.

"It IS Kitty, isn't  it?" he said. Then he took her hand and
pressed it.

"How you've  grown!" he exclaimed. He looked at her as if he were
looking not at her but at his own past.

"You don't  remember me?" he added.

"Chingachgook!" she exclaimed, recalling some childish memory.

"But he is now Sir Richard Norton," said her mother, giving him a
proud little pat on the shoulder; and they turned away, for the
gentlemen were dining in Hall.



It was dull fish, Kitty thought; the plates were half cold. It was
stale bread she thought, cut in meagre little squares; the colour,
the gaiety of Prestwich Terrace was still in her eyes, in her ears.
She granted, as she looked round, the superiority of the Lodge
china and silver; and the Japanese plates and the picture had been
hideous; but this dining-room with its hanging creepers and its
vast cracked canvases was so dark. At Prestwich Terrace the room
was full of light; the sound of hammer, hammer, hammer still rang
in her ears. She looked out at the fading greens in the garden.
For the thousandth time she echoed her childish wish that the tree
would either lie down or stand up instead of doing neither. It was
not actually raining, but gusts of whiteness seemed to blow about
the garden as the wind stirred the thick leaves on the laurels.

"Didn't  you notice it?" Mrs Malone suddenly appealed to her.

"What, Mama?" Kitty asked. She had not been attending.

"The odd taste in the fish," said her mother.

"I don't  think I did," she said; and Mrs Malone went on talking to
the butler. The plates were changed; another dish was brought in.
But Kitty was not hungry. She bit one of the green sweets that
were provided for her, and then the modest dinner, retrieved for
the ladies from the relics of last night's party, was over and she
followed her mother into the drawing-room.

It was too big when they were alone, but they always sat there.
The pictures seemed to be looking down at the empty chairs, and the
empty chairs seemed to be looking up at the pictures. The old
gentleman who had ruled the college over a hundred years ago seemed
to vanish in the daytime, but he came back when the lamps were lit.
The face was placid, solid and smiling, and singularly like Dr.
Malone, who, had a frame been set round him, might have hung over
the fireplace too.

"It's nice to have a quiet evening once in a way," Mrs Malone was
saying, "though the Fripps . . ." Her voice tailed off as she put
on her spectacles and took up The Times. This was her moment of
relaxation and recuperation after the day's work. She suppressed a
little yawn as she glanced up and down the columns of the
newspaper.

"What a charming man he was," she observed casually, as she looked
at the births and deaths. "One would hardly have taken him for an
American."

Kitty recalled her thoughts. She was thinking of the Robsons. Her
mother was talking about the Fripps.

"And I liked her too," she said rashly. "Wasn't  she lovely?"

"Hum - m - m. A little overdressed for my taste," said Mrs Malone
dryly. "And that accent - " she went on, looking through the paper,
"I sometimes hardly understood what she said."

Kitty was silent. Here they differed; as they did about so many
things.

Suddenly Mrs Malone looked up:

"Yes, just what I was saying to Bigge this morning," she said,
laying down the paper.

"What, Mama?" said Kitty.

"This man - in the leading article," said Mrs Malone. She touched
it with her finger.

"'With the best flesh, fish and fowl in the world,'" she read, "'we
shall not be able to turn them to account because we have none to
cook them' - what I was saying to Bigge this morning." She gave her
quick little sigh. Just when one wanted to impress people, like
those Americans, something went wrong. It had been the fish this
time. She foraged for her work things, and Kitty took up the
paper.

"It's the leading article," said Mrs Malone. That man almost
always said the very thing that she was thinking, which comforted
her, and gave her a sense of security in a world which seemed to
her to be changing for the worse.

"'Before the rigid and now universal enforcement of school
attendance . . . ?'" Kitty read out.

"Yes. That's it," said Mrs Malone, opening her work-box and
looking for her scissors.

"'. . . the children saw a good deal of cooking which, poor as it
was, yet gave them some taste and inkling of knowledge. They now
see nothing and they do nothing but read, write, sum, sew or
knit,'" Kitty read out.

"Yes, yes," said Mrs Malone. She unrolled the long strip of
embroidery upon which she was working a design of birds pecking at
fruit copied from a tomb at Ravenna. It was for the spare bedroom.

The leading article bored Kitty with its pompous fluency. She
searched the paper for some little piece of news that might
interest her mother. Mrs Malone liked someone to talk to her or
read aloud to her as she worked. Night after night her embroidery
served to weave the after-dinner talk into a pleasant harmony. One
said something and stitched; looked at the design, chose another
coloured silk, and stitched again. Sometimes Dr Malone read poetry
aloud - Pope: Tennyson. Tonight she would have liked Kitty to talk
to her. But she was becoming increasingly conscious of difficulty
with Kitty. Why? She glanced at her. What was wrong? she
wondered. She gave her quick little sigh.

Kitty turned over the large pages. Sheep had the fluke; Turks
wanted religious liberty; there was the General Election.

"Mr Gladstone - " she began.

Mrs Malone had lost her scissors. It annoyed her.

"Who can have taken them again?" she began. Kitty went down on the
floor to look for them. Mrs Malone ferreted in the work-box; then
she plunged her hand into the fissure between the cushion and the
chair frame and brought up not only the scissors but also a little
mother-of-pearl paper-knife that had been missing for ever so long.
The discovery annoyed her. It proved Ellen never shook up the
cushions properly.

"Here they are, Kitty," she said. They were silent. There was
always some constraint between them now.

"Did you enjoy your party at the Robsons', Kitty?" she asked,
resuming her embroidery. Kitty did not answer. She turned the
paper.

"There's been an experiment," she said. "An experiment with
electric light. 'A brilliant light,'" she read, "'was seen to
shoot forth suddenly shooting out a profound ray across the water
to the Rock. Everything was lit up as if by daylight.'" She
paused. She saw the bright light from the ships on the drawing-
room chair. But here the door opened and Hiscock came in with a
note on a salver.

Mrs Malone took it and read it in silence.

"No answer," she said. From the tone of her mother's voice Kitty
knew that something had happened. She sat holding the note in her
hand. Hiscock shut the door.

"Rose is dead!" said Mrs Malone. "Cousin Rose."

The note lay open on her knee.

"It's from Edward," she said.

"Cousin Rose is dead?" said Kitty. A moment before she had been
thinking of a bright light on a red rock. Now everything looked
dingy. There was a pause. There was silence. Tears stood in her
mother's eyes.

"Just when the children most wanted her," she said, sticking the
needle into her embroidery. She began to roll it up very slowly.
Kitty folded The Times and laid it on a little table, slowly, so
that it should not crackle. She had only seen Cousin Rose once or
twice. She felt awkward.

"Fetch me my engagement book," said her mother at last. Kitty
brought it.

"We must put off our dinner on Monday," said Mrs Malone, looking
through her engagements.

"And the Lathoms' party on Wednesday," Kitty murmured, looking over
her mother's shoulder.

"We can't  put off everything," said her mother sharply, and Kitty
felt rebuked.

But there were notes to be written. She wrote them at her mother's
dictation.

Why is she so ready to put off all our engagements? thought Mrs
Malone, watching her write. Why doesn't  she enjoy going out with
me any more? She glanced through the notes that her daughter
brought her.

"Why don't  you take more interest in things here, Kitty?" she said
irritably, pushing the letters away.

"Mama, dear - " Kitty began, deprecating the usual argument.

"But what is it you want to do?" her mother persisted. She had put
away her embroidery; she was sitting upright, she was looking
rather formidable.

"Your father and I only want you to do what you want to do," she
continued.

"Mama, dear - " Kitty repeated.

"You could help your father if it bores you helping me," said Mrs
Malone. "Papa told me the other day that you never come to him
now." She referred, Kitty knew, to his history of the college. He
had suggested that she should help him. Again she saw the ink
flowing - she had made an awkward brush with her arm - over five
generations of Oxford men, obliterating hours of her father's
exquisite penmanship; and could hear him say with his usual
courteous irony, "Nature did not intend you to be a scholar, my
dear," as he applied the blotting-paper.

"I know," she said guiltily. "I haven't  been to Papa lately. But
then there's always something - " She hesitated.

"Naturally," said Mrs Malone, "with a man in your father's
position . . ." Kitty sat silent. They both sat silent. They both
disliked this petty bickering; they both detested these recurring
scenes; and yet they seemed inevitable. Kitty got up, took the
letters she had written and put them in the hall.

What does she want? Mrs Malone asked herself, looking up at the
picture without seeing it. When I was her age . . . she thought,
and smiled. How well she remembered sitting at home on a spring
evening like this up in Yorkshire, miles from anywhere. You could
hear the beat of a horse's hoof on the road miles away. She could
remember flinging up her bedroom window and looking down on the
dark shrubs in the garden and crying out, "Is this life?" And in
the winter there was the snow. She could still hear the snow
flopping off the trees in the garden. And here was Kitty, living
in Oxford, in the midst of everything.

Kitty came back into the drawing-room and yawned very slightly.
She raised her hand to her face with an unconscious gesture of
fatigue that touched her mother.

"Tired, Kitty?" she said. "It's been a long day; you look pale."

"And you look tired too," said Kitty.

The bells came pushing forth one after another, one on top of
another, through the damp, heavy air.

"Go to bed, Kitty," said Mrs Malone. "There! It's striking ten."

"But aren't  you coming too, Mama?" said Kitty, standing beside her
chair.

"Your father won't  be back just yet," said Mrs Malone, putting on
her spectacles again.

Kitty knew it was useless to try to persuade her. It was part of
the mysterious ritual of her parents' lives. She bent down and
gave her mother the little perfunctory peck that was the only sign
they ever gave each other outwardly of their affection. Yet they
were very fond of each other; yet they always quarrelled.

"Good-night, and sleep well," said Mrs Malone.

"I don't  like to see your roses fade," she added, putting her arm
round her for once in a way.



She sat still after Kitty had gone. Rose is dead, she thought - 
Rose who was about her own age. She read the note again. It was
from Edward. And Edward, she mused, is in love with Kitty, but I
don't  know that I want her to marry him, she thought, taking up her
needle. No, not Edward. . . . There was young Lord Lasswade. . . .
That would be a nice marriage, she thought. Not that I want her
to be rich, not that I care about rank, she thought, threading her
needle. No, but he could give her what she wants. . . . What was
it? . . . Scope, she decided, beginning to stitch. Then again her
thoughts turned to Rose. Rose was dead. Rose who was about her
own age. That must have been the first time he proposed to her,
she thought, the day we had the picnic on the moors. It was a
spring day. They were sitting on the grass. She could see Rose
wearing a black hat with a cock's feather in it over her bright red
hair. She could still see her blush and look extremely pretty when
Abel rode up, much to their surprise - he was stationed at
Scarborough - the day they had the picnic on the moors.



The house at Abercorn Terrace was very dark. It smelt strongly of
spring flowers. For some days now wreaths had been piled one on
top of another on the hall table. In the dimness - all the blinds
were drawn - the flowers gleamed; and the hall smelt with the
amorous intensity of a hot-house. Wreath after wreath, they kept
arriving. There were lilies with broad bars of gold in them;
others with spotted throats sticky with honey; white tulips, white
lilac - flowers of all kinds, some with petals as thick as velvet,
others transparent, paper-thin; but all white, and clubbed
together, head to head, in circles, in ovals, in crosses so that
they scarcely looked like flowers. Black-edged cards were attached
to them, "With deep sympathy from Major and Mrs Brand"; "With love
and sympathy from General and Mrs Elkin"; "For dearest Rose from
Susan." Each card had a few words written on it.

Even now with the hearse at the door the bell rang; a messenger boy
appeared bearing more lilies. He raised his cap, as he stood in
the hall, for men were lurching down the stairs carrying the
coffin. Rose, in deep black, prompted by her nurse, stepped
forward and dropped her little bunch of violets on the coffin. But
it slipped off as it swayed down the brilliant sunlit steps on the
slanting shoulders of Whiteleys' men. The family followed after.



It was an uncertain day, with passing shadows and darting rays of
bright sunshine. The funeral started at a walking pace. Delia,
getting into the second carriage with Milly and Edward, noticed
that the houses opposite had their blinds drawn in sympathy, but a
servant peeped. The others, she noticed, did not seem to see her;
they were thinking of their mother. When they got into the main
road the pace quickened, for the drive to the cemetery was a long
one. Through the slit of the blind, Delia noticed dogs playing; a
beggar singing; men raising their hats as the hearse passed them.
But by the time their own carriage passed, the hats were on again.
Men walked briskly and unconcernedly along the pavement. The shops
were already gay with spring clothing; women paused and looked in
at the windows. But they would have to wear nothing but black all
the summer, Delia thought, looking at Edward's coal-black trousers.

They scarcely spoke, or only in little formal sentences, as if they
were already taking part in the ceremony. Somehow their relations
had changed. They were more considerate, and a little important
too, as if their mother's death had laid new responsibilities on
them. But the others knew how to behave; it was only she who had
to make an effort. She remained outside, and so did her father,
she thought. When Martin suddenly burst out laughing at tea, and
then stopped and looked guilty, she felt - that is what Papa would
do, that is what I should do if we were honest.

She glanced out of the window again. Another man raised his hat - a
tall man, a man in a frock-coat, but she would not allow herself to
think of Mr Parnell until the funeral was over.

At last they reached the cemetery. As she took her place in the
little group behind the coffin and walked up the church, she was
relieved to find that she was overcome by some generalised and
solemn emotion. People stood up on both sides of the church and
she felt their eyes on her. Then the service began. A clergyman,
a cousin, read it. The first words struck out with a rush of
extraordinary beauty. Delia, standing behind her father, noticed
how he braced himself and squared his shoulders.

"I am the resurrection and the life."

Pent up as she had been all these days in the half-lit house which
smelt of flowers, the outspoken words filled her with glory. This
she could feel genuinely; this was something that she said herself.
But then, as Cousin James went on reading, something slipped. The
sense was blurred. She could not follow with her reason. Then in
the midst of the argument came another burst of familiar beauty.
"And fade away suddenly like the grass, in the morning it is green,
and groweth up; but in the evening it is cut down, dried up, and
withered." She could feel the beauty of that. Again it was like
music; but then Cousin James seemed to hurry, as if he did not
altogether believe what he was saying. He seemed to pass from the
known to the unknown; from what he believed to what he did not
believe; even his voice altered. He looked clean, he looked
starched and ironed like his robes. But what did he mean by what
he was saying? She gave it up. Either one understood or one did
not understand, she thought. Her mind wandered.

But I will not think of him, she thought, seeing a tall man who
stood beside her on a platform and raised his hat, until it's over.
She fixed her eyes upon her father. She watched him dab a great
white pocket-handkerchief to his eyes and put it in his pocket;
then he pulled it out and dabbed his eyes with it again. Then the
voice stopped; he put his handkerchief finally in his pocket; and
again they all formed up, the little group of the family, behind
the coffin and again the dark people on either side rose, and
watched them and let them go first and followed after.

It was a relief to feel the soft damp air blowing its leafy smell
in her face again. But again now that she was out of doors, she
began to notice things. She noticed how the black funeral horses
were pawing the ground; they were scraping little pits with their
hooves in the yellow gravel. She remembered hearing that funeral
horses came from Belgium and were very vicious. They looked
vicious she thought; their black necks were flecked with foam - but
she recalled herself. They went straggling in ones and twos along
a path until they reached a fresh mound of yellow earth heaped
beside a pit; and there again she noticed how the grave-diggers
stood at a little distance, rather behind, with their spades.

There was a pause; people kept on arriving and took up their
positions, some a little higher, some a little lower. She observed
a poor-looking shabby woman prowling on the outskirts, and tried to
think whether she were some old servant, but she could not put a
name to her. Her Uncle Digby, her father's brother, stood directly
opposite her, with his top-hat held like some sacred vessel between
his hands, the image of grave decorum. Some of the women were
crying; but not the men; the men had one pose; the women had
another, she observed. Then it all began again. The splendid gust
of music blew through them - "Man that is born of a woman": the
ceremony had renewed itself; once more they were grouped, united.
The family pressed a little closer to the graveside and looked
fixedly at the coffin which lay with its polish and its brass
handles there in the earth to be buried for ever. It looked too
new to be buried for ever. She stared down into the grave. There
lay her mother; in that coffin - the woman she had loved and hated
so. Her eyes dazzled. She was afraid that she might faint; but
she must look; she must feel; it was the last chance that was left
her. Earth dropped on the coffin; three pebbles fell on the hard
shiny surface; and as they dropped she was possessed by a sense of
something everlasting; of life mixing with death, of death becoming
life. For as she looked she heard the sparrows chirp quicker and
quicker; she heard wheels in the distance sound louder and louder;
life came closer and closer. . . .

"We give thee hearty thanks," said the voice, "for that it has
pleased thee to deliver this our sister out of the miseries of this
sinful world - "

What a lie! she cried to herself. What a damnable lie! He had
robbed her of the one feeling that was genuine; he had spoilt her
one moment of understanding.

She looked up. She saw Morris and Eleanor side by side; their
faces were blurred; their noses were red; the tears were running
down them. As for her father he was so stiff and so rigid that she
had a convulsive desire to laugh aloud. Nobody can feel like that,
she thought. He's overdoing it. None of us feel anything at all,
she thought: we're all pretending.

Then there was a general movement; the attempt at concentration was
over. People strolled off this way and that; there was no attempt
now to form into a procession; little groups came together; people
shook hands rather furtively, among the graves, and even smiled.

"How good of you to come!" said Edward, shaking hands with old Sir
James Graham, who gave him a little pat on the shoulder. Ought she
to go and thank him too? The graves made it difficult. It was
becoming a shrouded and subdued morning party among the graves.
She hesitated - she did not know what she ought to do next. Her
father had walked on. She looked back. The grave-diggers had come
forward; they were piling the wreaths one on top of another neatly;
and the prowling woman had joined them and was stooping down to
read the names on the cards. The ceremony was over; rain was
falling.



1891


The autumn wind blew over England. It twitched the leaves off the
trees, and down they fluttered, spotted red and yellow, or sent
them floating, flaunting in wide curves before they settled. In
towns coming in gusts round the corners, the wind blew here a hat
off; there lifted a veil high above a woman's head. Money was in
brisk circulation. The streets were crowded. Upon the sloping
desks of the offices near St. Paul's, clerks paused with their pens
on the ruled page. It was difficult to work after the holidays.
Margate, Eastbourne and Brighton had bronzed them and tanned them.
The sparrows and starlings, making their discordant chatter round
the eaves of St. Martin's, whitened the heads of the sleek statues
holding rods or rolls of paper in Parliament Square. Blowing
behind the boat train, the wind ruffled the channel, tossed the
grapes in Provence, and made the lazy fisher boy, who was lying on
his back in his boat in the Mediterranean, roll over and snatch a
rope.

But in England, in the North, it was cold. Kitty, Lady Lasswade,
sitting on the terrace beside her husband and his spaniel, drew the
cloak round her shoulders. She was looking at the hill top, where
the snuffer-shaped monument raised by the old Earl made a mark for
ships at sea. There was mist on the woods. Near at hand the stone
ladies on the terrace had scarlet flowers in their urns. Thin blue
smoke drifted across the flaming dahlias in the long beds that went
down to the river. "Burning weeds," she said aloud. Then there
was a tap on the window, and her little boy in a pink frock
stumbled out, holding his spotted horse.

In Devonshire where the round red hills and the steep valleys
hoarded the sea air leaves were still thick on the trees - too
thick, Hugh Gibbs said at breakfast. Too thick for shooting, he
said, and Milly, his wife, left him to go to his meeting. With her
basket on her arm she walked down the well-kept crazy pavement with
the swaying movement of a woman with child. There hung the yellow
pears on the orchard wall, lifting the leaves over them, they were
so swollen. But the wasps had got at them - the skin was broken.
With her hand on the fruit she paused. Pop, pop, pop sounded in
the distant woods. Someone was shooting.

The smoke hung in veils over the spires and domes of the University
cities. Here it choked the mouth of a gargoyle; there it clung to
the walls that were peeled yellow. Edward, who was taking his
brisk constitutional, noted smell, sound and colour; which
suggested how complex impressions are; few poets compress enough;
but there must be some line in Greek or Latin, he was thinking,
which sums up the contrast, - when Mrs Lathom passed him and he
raised his cap.

In the Law Courts the leaves lay dry and angular on the flagstones.
Morris, remembering his childhood, shuffled his feet through them
on his way to his chambers, and they scattered edgeways along the
gutters. Not yet trodden down they lay in Kensington Gardens, and
children, crunching the shells as they ran, scooped up a handful
and scudded on through the mist down the avenues, with their hoops.

Racing over the hills in the country the wind blew vast rings of
shadow that dwindled again to green. But in London the streets
narrowed the clouds; mist hung thick in the East End by the river;
made the voices of men crying "Any old iron to sell, any old iron,"
sound distant; and in the suburbs the organs were muted. The wind
blew the smoke - for in every back garden in the angle of the ivy-
grown wall that still sheltered a few last geraniums, leaves were
heaped up; keen fanged flames were eating them - out into the
street, into windows that stood open in the drawing-room in the
morning. For it was October, the birth of the year.



Eleanor was sitting at her writing-table with her pen in her hand.
It's awfully queer, she thought, touching the ink-corroded patch of
bristle on the back of Martin's walrus with the point of her pen,
that THAT should have gone on all these years. That solid object
might survive them all. If she threw it away it would still exist
somewhere or other. But she never had thrown it away because it
was part of other things - her mother for example. . . . She drew
on her blotting paper; a dot with strokes raying out round it.
Then she looked up. They were burning weeds in the back garden;
there was a drift of smoke; a sharp acrid smell; and leaves were
falling. A barrel organ was playing up the street. "Sur le pont
d'Avignon" she hummed in time to it. How did it go? - the song
Pippy used to sing as she wiped your ears with a piece of slimy
flannel?

"Ron, ron, ron, et plon, plon plon," she hummed. Then the tune
stopped. The organ had moved further away. She dipped her pen in
the ink.

"Three times eight," she murmured, "is twenty-four," she said
decidedly; wrote a figure at the bottom of the page, swept together
the little red and blue books and took them to her father's study.



"Here's the housekeeper!" he said good-humouredly as she came in.
He was sitting in his leather armchair reading a pinkish financial
paper.

"Here's the housekeeper," he repeated, looking up over his glasses.
He was getting slower and slower, she thought; and she was in a
hurry. But they got on extremely well; they were almost like
brother and sister. He put down his paper and went to the writing-
table.

But I wish you would hurry, Papa, she thought as she watched the
deliberate way in which he unlocked the drawer in which he kept his
cheque-book, or I shall be late.

"Milk's very high," he said, tapping the book with the gilt cow.
"Yes. It's eggs in October," she said.

As he made out the cheque with extreme deliberation she glanced
round the room. It looked like an office, with its files of papers
and its deed-boxes, except that horses' bits hung by the fireplace,
and there was the silver cup he had won at polo. Would he sit
there all the morning reading the financial papers and considering
his investments, she wondered? He stopped writing.

"And where are you off to now?" he asked with his shrewd little
smile.

"A Committee," she said.

"A Committee," he repeated, signing his firm heavy signature.
"Well, stand up for yourself; don't  be sat on, Nell." He entered a
figure in the ledger.

"Are you coming with me this afternoon, Papa?" she said as he
finished writing the figure. "It's Morris's case you know; at the
Law Courts."

He shook his head.

"No; I've  got to be in the City at three," he said.

"Then I shall see you at lunch," she said, making a movement to go.
But he held up his hand. He had something to say, but he
hesitated. He was getting rather heavier in the face, she noted;
there were little veins in his nose; he was getting rather too red
and heavy.

"I was thinking of looking in at the Digbys'," he said, at length.
He got up and walked to the window. He looked out at the back
garden. She fidgeted.

"How the leaves are falling!" he remarked.

"Yes," she said. "They're burning weeds."

He stood looking at the smoke for a moment.

"Burning weeds," he repeated, and stopped.

"It's Maggie's birthday," at last he came out with it. "I thought
I'd take her some little present - " He paused. He meant that he
wished her to buy it, she knew.

"What would you like to give her?" she asked.

"Well," he said vaguely, 'something pretty you know - something she
could wear."

Eleanor reflected - Maggie, her little cousin; was she seven or
eight?

"A necklace? A brooch? Something like that?" she asked quickly.

"Yes, something like that," said her father, settling down in his
chair again. "Something pretty, something she could wear, you
know." He opened the paper and gave her a little nod. "Thank you,
my dear," he said as she left the room.



On the hall table, between a silver salver laden with visiting-
cards - some with their corners turned down, some large, some small - 
and a piece of purple plush with which the Colonel polished his
top hat - lay a thin foreign envelope with "England" marked in large
letters in the corner. Eleanor, running down the stairs in a
hurry, swept it into her bag as she passed. Then she ran at a
peculiar ambling trot down the Terrace. At the corner she stopped
and looked anxiously down the road. Among the other traffic she
singled out one bulky form; mercifully, it was yellow; mercifully
she had caught her bus. She hailed it and climbed on top. She
sighed with relief as she pulled the leather apron over her knees.
All responsibility now rested with the driver. She relaxed; she
breathed in the soft London air; she heard the dull London roar
with pleasure. She looked along the street and relished the sight
of cabs, vans and carriages all trotting past with an end in view.
She liked coming back in October to the full stir of life after the
summer was over. She had been staying in Devonshire with the
Gibbses. That's turned out very well, she thought, thinking of her
sister's marriage to Hugh Gibbs, seeing Milly with her babies. And
Hugh - she smiled. He rode about on a great white horse, breaking
up litters. But there are too many trees and cows and too many
little hills instead of one big one, she thought. She did not like
Devonshire. She was glad to be back in London, on top of the
yellow bus, with her bag stuffed with papers, and everything
beginning again in October. They had left the residential quarter;
the houses were changing; they were turning into shops. This was
her world; here she was in her element. The streets were crowded;
women were swarming in and out of shops with their shopping
baskets. There was something customary, rhythmical about it, she
thought, like rooks swooping in a field, rising and falling.

She, too, was going to her work - she turned her watch on her wrist
without looking at it. After the Committee, Duffus; after Duffus,
Dickson. Then lunch; and the Law Courts . . . then lunch and the
Law Courts at two-thirty, she repeated. The bus trundled along the
Bayswater Road. The streets were becoming poorer and poorer.

Perhaps I oughtn't  to have given the job to Duffus, she said to
herself - she was thinking of Peter Street where she had built
houses; the roof was leaking again; there was a bad smell in the
sink. But here the omnibus stopped; people got in and out; the
omnibus went on again - but it's better to give the work to a small
man, she thought, looking at the huge plate-glass windows of one of
the large shops, instead of going to one of those big firms. There
were always small shops side by side with big shops. It puzzled
her. How did the small shops manage to make a living? she
wondered. But if Duffus, she began - here the omnibus stopped; she
looked up; she rose " - if Duffus thinks he can bully me," she said
as she went down the steps, "he'll find he's mistaken."

She walked quickly up the cinder path to the galvanised iron shed
in which the meeting took place. She was late; there they were
already. It was her first meeting since the holidays, and they all
smiled at her. Judd even took his toothpick out of his mouth - a
sign of recognition that flattered her. Here we all are again, she
thought, taking her place and laying her papers on the table.

But she meant "them", not herself. She did not exist; she was not
anybody at all. But there they all were - Brocket, Cufnell, Miss
Sims, Ramsden, Major Porter and Mrs Lazenby. The Major preaching
organisation; Miss Sims  ex-mill hand  scenting condescension; Mrs
Lazenby, offering to write to her cousin Sir John, upon which Judd,
the retired shopkeeper, snubbed her. She smiled as she took her
seat. Miriam Parrish was reading letters. But why starve
yourself, Eleanor asked as she listened. She was thinner than
ever.

She looked round the room as the letters were read. There had been
a dance. Festoons of red and yellow paper were slung across the
ceiling. The coloured picture of the Princess of Wales had loops
of yellow roses at the corners; a sea-green ribbon across her
breast, a round yellow dog on her lap, and pearls slung and knotted
over her shoulders. She wore an air of serenity, of indifference;
a queer comment upon their divisions, Eleanor thought; something
that the Lazenbys worshipped; that Miss Sims derided; that Judd
looked at cocking his eyebrows, picking his teeth. If he had had a
son, he had told her, he would have sent him to the Varsity. But
she recalled herself. Major Porter had turned to her.

"Now, Miss Pargiter," he said, drawing her in, because they were
both of the same social standing, "you haven't  given us your
opinion."

She pulled herself together and gave him her opinion. She had an
opinion - a very definite opinion. She cleared her throat and
began.



The smoke blowing through Peter Street had condensed, between the
narrowness of the houses, into a fine grey veil. But the houses on
either side were clearly visible. Save for two in the middle of
the street, they were all precisely the same - yellow-grey boxes
with slate tents on top. Nothing whatever was happening; a few
children were playing in the street, two cats turned something over
in the gutter with their paws. Yet a woman leaning out of the
windows searched this way, that way, up and down the street as if
she were raking every cranny for something to feed on. Her eyes,
rapacious, greedy, like the eyes of a bird of prey, were also sulky
and sleepy, as if they had nothing to feed their hunger upon.
Nothing happened - nothing whatever. Still she gazed up and down
with her indolent dissatisfied stare. Then a trap turned the
corner. She watched it. It stopped in front of the houses
opposite which, since the sills were green, and there was a plaque
with a sunflower stamped on it over the door, were different from
the others. A little man in a tweed cap got out and rapped at the
door. It was opened by a woman who was about to have a baby. She
shook her head; looked up and down the street; then shut the door.
The man waited. The horse stood patiently with the reins drooping
and its head bent. Another woman appeared at the window, with a
white many-chinned face, and an under lip that stood out like a
ledge. Leaning out of the window side by side the two women
watched the man. He was bandy-legged; he was smoking. They passed
some remark about him together. He walked up and down as if he
were waiting for somebody. Now he threw away his cigarette. They
watched him. What would he do next? Was he going to give his
horse a feed? But here a tall woman wearing a coat and skirt of
grey tweed came round the corner hastily; and the little man turned
and touched his cap.



"Sorry I'm late," Eleanor called out, and Duffus touched his cap
with the friendly smile that always pleased her.

"That's all right, Miss Pargiter," he said. She always hoped that
he did not feel that she was the ordinary employer.

"Now we'll go over it," she said. She hated the job, but it had to
be done.

The door was opened by Mrs Toms, the downstairs lodger.

Oh dear, thought Eleanor, observing the slant of her apron, another
baby coming, after all I told her.

They went from room to room of the little house, Mrs Toms and Mrs
Grove following after. There was a crack here; a stain there.
Duffus had a foot-rule in his hand with which he tapped the
plaster. The worst of it is, she thought, as she let Mrs Toms do
the talking, that I can't  help liking him. It was his Welsh accent
largely; he was a charming ruffian. He was as supple as an eel,
she knew; but when he talked like that, in that sing-song, which
reminded her of Welsh valleys. . . . But he had cheated her at
every point. There was a hole you could poke your finger through
in the plaster.

"Look at that, Mr Duffus, there - " she said, stooping and poking
her finger. He was licking his pencil. She loved going to his
yard with him and seeing him size up planks and bricks; she loved
his technical words for things, his little hard words.

"Now we'll go upstairs," she said. He seemed to her like a fly
struggling to haul itself up out of a saucer. It was touch and go
with small employers like Duffus; they might haul themselves up and
become the Judds of their day and send their sons to the Varsity;
or on the other hand they might fall in and then - He had a wife and
five children; she had seen them in the room behind the shop,
playing with reels of cotton on the floor. And she always hoped
that they would ask her in. . . . But here was the top floor where
old Mrs Potter lay bedridden. She knocked; she called out in a
loud cheerful voice, "May we come in?"

There was no answer. The old woman was stone deaf; so in they
went. There she was, as usual, doing nothing whatever, propped up
in the corner of her bed.

"I've  brought Mr Duffus to look at your ceiling," Eleanor shouted.

The old woman looked up and began plucking with her hands like a
large tousled ape. She looked at them wildly, suspiciously.

"The ceiling, Mr Duffus," said Eleanor. She pointed to a yellow
stain on the ceiling. The house had only been built five years;
and yet everything wanted repairing. Duffus threw open the window
and leant out. Mrs Potter clutched hold of Eleanor's hand, as if
she suspected that they were going to hurt her.

"We've  come to look at your ceiling," Eleanor repeated very loudly.
But the words conveyed nothing. The old woman went off into a
whining plaint; the words ran themselves together into a chant that
was half plaint, half curse. If only the Lord would take her.
Every night, she said, she implored Him to let her go. All her
children were dead.

"When I wake in the morning . . ." she began.

"Yes, yes, Mrs Potter," Eleanor tried to soothe her; but her hands
were firmly grasped.

"I pray Him to let me go," Mrs Potter continued.

"It's the leaves in the gutter," said Duffus, popping his head in
again.

"And the pain - " Mrs Potter stretched out her hands; they were
knotted and grooved like the gnarled roots of a tree.

"Yes, yes," said Eleanor. "But there's a leak; it's not only the
dead leaves," she said to Duffus.

Duffus put his head out again.

"We're going to make you more comfortable," Eleanor shouted to the
old woman. Now she was cringing and fawning; now she had pressed
her hand to her lips.

Duffus drew his head in again.

"Have you found out what's wrong?" Eleanor said to him sharply. He
was entering something in his pocket-book. She longed to go. Mrs
Potter was asking her to feel her shoulder. She felt her shoulder.
Her hand was still grasped. There was medicine on the table;
Miriam Parrish came every week. Why do we do it? she asked herself
as Mrs Potter went on talking. Why do we force her to live? she
asked, looking at the medicine on the table. She could stand it no
longer. She withdrew her hand.

"Good-bye, Mrs Potter," she shouted. She was insincere; she was
hearty. "We're going to mend your ceiling," she shouted. She shut
the door. Mrs Groves waddled in advance of her to show her the
sink in the scullery. A wisp of yellow hair hung down behind her
dirty ears. If I had to do this every day of my life, Eleanor
thought, as she followed them down into the scullery, I should
become a bag of bones like Miriam; with a string of beads. . . .
And what's the use of that? she thought, stooping to smell the sink
in the scullery.

"Well, Duffus," she said, facing him when the inspection was over,
with the smell of drains still in her nose. "What d'you propose to
do about it?"

Her anger was rising; it was his fault largely. He had swindled
her. But as she stood facing him and observed his little underfed
body, and how his bow tie had worked up over his collar, she felt
uncomfortable.

He shuffled and squirmed; she felt that she was going to lose her
temper.

"If you can't  make a good job of it," she said curtly, "I shall
employ somebody else." She adopted the tone of the Colonel's
daughter; the upper middle-class tone that she detested. She saw
him turn sullen before her eyes. But she rubbed it in.

"You ought to be ashamed of it," she told him. He was impressed
she could see. "Good morning," she said briefly.

The ingratiating smile was not produced for her benefit again, she
observed. But you have to bully them or else they despise you, she
thought as Mrs Toms let her out, and once more she observed the
slant in her apron. A crowd of children stood round staring at
Duffus's pony. But none of them, she noticed, dared stroke the
pony's nose.



She was late. She gave one look at the sunflower on the terra-
cotta plaque. That symbol of her girlish sentiment amused her
grimly. She had meant it to signify flowers, fields in the heart
of London; but now it was cracked. She broke into her usual
ambling trot. The movement seemed to break up the disagreeable
crust; to jolt off the grasp of the old woman's hand that was still
on her shoulder. She ran; she dodged. Shopping women got in her
way. She dashed into the road waving her hand among the carts and
horses. The conductor saw her, curved his arm round her and hauled
her up. She had caught her bus.

She trod on the toe of a man in the corner, and pitched down
between two elderly women. She was panting slightly; her hair was
coming down; she was red with running. She cast a glance at her
fellow-passengers. They all looked settled, elderly, as if their
minds were made up. For some reason she always felt that she was
the youngest person in an omnibus, but today, since she had won her
scrap with Judd, she felt that she was grown up. The grey line of
houses jolted up and down before her eyes as the omnibus trundled
along the Bayswater Road. The shops were turning into houses;
there were big houses and little houses; public houses and private
houses. And here a church raised its filigree spire. Underneath
were pipes, wires, drains. . . . Her lips began moving. She was
talking to herself. There's always a public house, a library and a
church, she was muttering.



The man on whose toe she had trodden sized her up; a well-known
type; with a bag; philanthropic; well nourished; a spinster; a
virgin; like all the women of her class, cold; her passions had
never been touched; yet not unattractive. She was laughing. . . .
Here she looked up and caught his eye. She had been talking aloud
to herself in an omnibus. She must cure herself of the habit. She
must wait till she brushed her teeth. But luckily the bus was
stopping. She jumped out. She began to walk quickly up Melrose
Place. She felt vigorous and young. She noticed everything
freshly after Devonshire. She looked down the long many-pillared
vista of Abercorn Terrace. The houses, with their pillars and
their front gardens, all looked highly respectable; in every front
room she seemed to see a parlourmaid's arm sweep over the table,
laying it for luncheon. In several rooms they were already sitting
down to luncheon; she could see them between the tent-shaped
opening made by the curtains. She would be late for her own
luncheon, she thought as she ran up the front steps and fitted her
latch-key in the door. Then, as if someone were speaking, words
formed in her mind. "Something pretty, something to wear." She
stopped with her key in the lock. Maggie's birthday; her father's
present; she had forgotten it. She paused. She turned, she ran
down the steps again. She must go to Lamley's.

Mrs Lamley, who had grown stout these last years, was masticating a
mouthful of cold mutton in the back room when she saw Miss Eleanor
through the glass door.

"Good morning, Miss Eleanor," she began, coming out.

"Something pretty, something to wear," Eleanor panted. She was
looking very well - quite brown after her holiday, Mrs Lamley
noticed.

"For my niece - I mean cousin. Sir Digby's little girl," Eleanor
brought out.

Mrs Lamley deprecated the cheapness of her goods.

There were toy boats; dolls; twopenny gold watches - but nothing
nice enough for Sir Digby's little girl. But Miss Eleanor was in a
hurry.

"There," she said, pointing to a card of bead necklaces. "That'll
do."

It looked a little cheap, Mrs Lamley thought; reaching down a blue
necklace with gold spots, but Miss Eleanor was in such a hurry that
she wouldn't  even have it wrapped in brown paper.

"I shall be late as it is, Mrs Lamley," she said, with a genial
wave of her hand; and off she ran.

Mrs Lamley liked her. She always seemed so friendly. It was such
a pity she didn't  marry - such a mistake to let the younger sister
marry before the elder. But then she had the Colonel to look
after, and he was getting on now, Mrs Lamley concluded, going back
to her mutton in the back shop.



"Miss Eleanor won't  be a minute," said the Colonel as Crosby
brought in the dishes. "Leave the covers on." He stood with his
back to the fireplace waiting for her. Yes, he thought, I don't 
see why not. "I don't  see why not," he repeated, looking at the
dish-cover. Mira was on the scene again; the other fellow had
turned out, as he knew he would, a bad egg. And what provision was
he to make for Mira? What was he to do about it? It had struck
him that he would like to put the whole thing before Eleanor. Why
not after all? She's not a child any longer, he thought; and he
didn't  like this business of - of - shutting things up in drawers.
But he felt some shyness at the thought of telling his own
daughter.

"Here she is," he said abruptly to Crosby, who stood waiting mutely
behind him.

No, no, he said to himself with sudden conviction, as Eleanor came
in. I can't  do it. For some reason when he saw her he realised
that he could not tell her. And after all, he thought, seeing how
bright-cheeked, how unconcerned she looked, she has her own life to
live. A spasm of jealousy passed through him. She's got her own
affairs to think about, he thought as they sat down.

She pushed a necklace across the table towards him.

"Hullo, what's that?" he said, looking at it blankly.

"Maggie's present, Papa," she said. "The best I could do. . . .
I'm afraid it's rather cheap."

"Yes; that'll do very nicely," he said, glancing at it
absentmindedly. "Just what she'll like," he added, shoving it to
one side. He began to carve the chicken.

She was very hungry; she was still rather breathless. She felt a
little 'spun round," as she put it to herself. What did you spin
things round on? she wondered, helping herself to bread sauce - a
pivot? The scene had changed so often that morning; and every
scene required a different adjustment; bringing this to the front;
sinking that to the depths. And now she felt nothing; hungry
merely; merely a chicken-eater; blank. But as she ate, the sense
of her father imposed itself. She liked his solidity, as he sat
opposite her munching his chicken methodically. What had he been
doing, she wondered. Taking shares out of one company and putting
them in another? He roused himself.

"Well, how was the Committee?" he asked. She told him,
exaggerating her triumph with Judd.

"That's right. Stand up to 'em, Nell. Don't  let yourself be sat
on," he said. He was proud of her in his own way; and she liked
him to be proud of her. At the same time she did not mention
Duffus and Rigby Cottages. He had no sympathy with people who were
foolish about money, and she never got a penny interest: it all
went on repairs. She turned the conversation to Morris and his
case at the Law Courts. She looked at her watch again. Her
sister-in-law Celia had told her to meet her at the Law Courts at
two-thirty sharp.

"I shall have to hurry," she said.

"Ah, but these lawyer chaps always know how to spin things out,"
said the Colonel. "Who's the Judge?"

"Sanders Curry," said Eleanor.

'Then it'll last till Domesday," said the Colonel.

"Which Court's he sitting in?" he asked.

Eleanor did not know.

"Here, Crosby - " said the Colonel. He sent Crosby for The Times.
He began opening and turning the great sheets with his clumsy
fingers as Eleanor swallowed her tart. By the time she had poured
out coffee he had found out in which court the case was being
heard.

"And you're going to the City, Papa?" she said as she put down her
cup.

"Yes. To a meeting," he said. He loved going to the City,
whatever he did there.

"Odd it should be Curry who's trying the case," she said, rising.
They had dined with him not long ago in a dreary great house
somewhere off Queen's Gate.

"D'you remember that party?" she said, getting up. "The old oak?"
Curry collected oak chests.

"All shams I suspect," said her father. "Don't  hurry," he
expostulated. "Take a cab, Nell - if you want any change - " he
began, fumbling with his curtailed fingers for silver. As she
watched him Eleanor felt the old childish feeling that his pockets
were bottomless silver mines from which half-crowns could be dug
eternally.

"Well, then," she said, taking the coins, "we shall meet at tea."

"No," he reminded her, "I'm going round by the Digbys'."

He took the necklace in his large hairy hand. It looked a little
cheap, Eleanor was afraid.

"And what about a box for this, eh?" he asked.

"Crosby, find a box for the necklace," said Eleanor. And Crosby,
suddenly radiating importance, hurried off to the basement.

"It'll be dinner then," she said to her father. That'll mean, she
thought with relief, that I needn't  be back for tea.

"Yes, dinner," he said. He held a spill of paper in his hand which
he was applying to the end of his cigar. He sucked. A little puff
of smoke rose from the cigar. She liked the smell of cigars. She
stood for a moment and drew it in.

"And give my love to Aunt Eugénie," she said. He nodded as he
puffed at his cigar.



It was a treat to take a hansom - it saved fifteen minutes. She
leant back in the corner, with a little sigh of content, as the
flaps clicked above her knees. For a minute her mind was
completely vacant. She enjoyed the peace, the silence, the rest
from exertion as she sat there in the corner of the cab. She felt
detached, a spectator, as it trotted along. The morning had been a
rush; one thing on top of another. Now, until she reached the Law
Courts, she could sit and do nothing. It was a long way; and the
horse was a plodding horse, a red-coated hairy horse. It kept up
its steady jog-trot all down the Bayswater Road. There was very
little traffic; people were still at luncheon. A soft grey mist
filled up the distance; the bells jingled; the houses passed. She
ceased to notice what houses they were passing. She half shut her
eyes, and then, involuntarily, she saw her own hand take a letter
from the hall table. When? That very morning. What had she done
with it? Put it in her bag? Yes. There it was, unopened; a
letter from Martin in India. She would read it as they drove
along. It was written on very thin paper in Martin's little hand.
It was longer than usual; it was about an adventure with somebody
called Renton. Who was Renton? She could not remember. "We
started at dawn," she read.

She looked out of the window. They were being held up by traffic
at the Marble Arch. Carriages were coming out of the Park. A
horse pranced; but the coachman had him well in hand.

She read again: "I found myself alone in the middle of the
jungle. . . ."

But what were you doing? she asked.

She saw her brother; his red hair; his round face; and the rather
pugnacious expression which always made her afraid that he would
get himself into trouble one of these days. And so he had,
apparently.

"I had lost my way; and the sun was sinking," she read.

"The sun was sinking . . ." Eleanor repeated, glancing ahead of her
down Oxford Street. The sun shone on dresses in a window. A
jungle was a very thick wood, she supposed; made of stunted little
trees; dark green in colour. Martin was in the jungle alone, and
the sun was sinking. What happened next? "I thought it better to
stay where I was." So he stood in the midst of little trees alone,
in the jungle; and the sun was sinking. The street before her lost
its detail. It must have been cold, she thought, when the sun
sank. She read again. He had to make a fire. "I looked in my
pocket and found that I had only two matches . . . The first match
went out." She saw a heap of dry sticks and Martin alone watching
the match go out. "Then I lit the other, and by sheer luck it
did the trick." The paper began to burn; the twigs caught; a fan
of fire blazed up. She skipped on in her anxiety to reach the
end . . . - "once I thought I heard voices shouting, but they died
away."

"They died away!" said Eleanor aloud.

They had stopped at Chancery Lane. An old woman was being helped
across the road by a policeman; but the road was a jungle.

"They died away," she said. "And then?"

". . . I climbed a tree . . . I saw the track . . . the sun was
rising. . . . They had given me up for dead."

The cab stopped. For a moment Eleanor sat still. She saw nothing
but stunted little trees, and her brother looking at the sun rising
over the jungle. The sun was rising. Flames for a moment danced
over the vast funereal mass of the Law Courts. It was the second
match that did the trick, she said to herself as she paid the
driver and went in.



"Oh, there you are!" cried a little woman in furs, who was standing
by one of the doors.

"I had given you up. I was just going in." She was a small cat-
faced woman, worried, but very proud of her husband.

They pushed through the swing doors into the Court where the case
was being tried. It seemed dark and crowded at first. Men in wigs
and gowns were getting up and sitting down and coming in and going
out like a flock of birds settling here and there on a field. They
all looked unfamiliar; she could not see Morris. She looked about
her, trying to find him.

"There he is," Celia whispered.

One of the barristers in the front row turned his head. It was
Morris; but how odd he looked in his yellow wig! His glance passed
over them without any sign of recognition. Nor did she smile at
him; the solemn sallow atmosphere forbade personalities; there was
something ceremonial about it all. From where she sat she could
see his face in profile; the wig squared his forehead, and gave him
a framed look, like a picture. Never had she seen him to such
advantage; with such a brow, with such a nose. She glanced round.
They all looked like pictures; all the barristers looked emphatic,
cut out, like eighteenth-century portraits hung upon a wall. They
were still rising and settling, laughing, talking. . . . Suddenly
a door was thrown open. The usher demanded silence for his
lordship. There was silence; everybody stood up; and the Judge
came in. He made one bow and took his seat under the Lion and the
Unicorn. Eleanor felt a little thrill of awe run through her.
That was old Curry. But how transformed! Last time she had seen
him he was sitting at the head of a dinner-table; a long yellow
strip of embroidery went rippling down the middle; and he had taken
her, with a candle, round the drawing-room to look at his old oak.
But now, there he was, awful, magisterial, in his robes.

A barrister had risen. She tried to follow what the man with a big
nose was saying; but it was difficult to pick it up now. She
listened, however. Then another barrister rose - a chicken-breasted
little man, wearing gold pince-nez. He was reading some document;
then he too began to argue. She could understand parts of what he
was saying; though how it bore on the case she did not know. When
was Morris going to speak, she wondered? Not yet apparently. As
her father had said, these lawyer chaps knew how to spin things
out. There had been no need to hurry over luncheon; an omnibus
would have done just as well. She fixed her eyes on Morris. He
was cracking some joke with the sandy man next to him. Those were
his cronies, she thought; this was his life. She remembered his
passion for the Bar as a boy. It was she who had talked Papa
round; one morning she had taken her life in her hand and gone to
his study . . . but now, to her excitement, Morris himself got up.

She felt her sister-in-law stiffen with nervousness and clasp her
little bag tightly. Morris looked very tall, and very black and
white as he began. One hand was on the edge of his gown. How well
she knew that gesture of Morris's, she thought - grasping something,
so that you saw the white scar where he had cut himself bathing.
But she did not recognise the other gesture - the way he flung his
arm out. That belonged to his public life, his life in the Courts.
And his voice was unfamiliar. But every now and then as he warmed
to his speech, there was a tone in his voice that made her smile;
it was his private voice. She could not help half turning to her
sister-in-law as if to say, How like Morris! But Celia was looking
with absolute fixity ahead of her at her husband. Eleanor, too,
tried to fix her mind upon the argument. He spoke with
extraordinary clearness; he spaced his words beautifully. Suddenly
the Judge interrupted:

"Do I understand you to hold, Mr Pargiter . . . ?" he said in urbane
yet awful tones; and Eleanor was thrilled to see how instantly
Morris stopped short; how respectfully he bent his head as the
Judge spoke.

But will he know the answer? she thought, as if he were a child,
shifting in her seat with nervousness lest he might break down.
But he had the answer at his finger-ends. Without hurry or flutter
he opened a book; found his place; read out a passage, upon which
old Curry nodded, and made a note in the great volume that lay open
in front of him. She was immensely relieved.

"How well he did that!" she whispered. Her sister-in-law nodded;
but she still grasped her bag tightly. Eleanor felt that she could
relax. She glanced round her. It was an odd mixture of solemnity
and licence. Barristers kept coming in and out. They stood
leaning against the wall of the Court. In the pale top light all
their faces looked parchment-coloured; all their features seemed
cut out. They had lit the gas. She gazed at the Judge himself.
He was now lying back in his great carved chair under the Lion and
the Unicorn, listening. He looked infinitely sad and wise, as if
words had been beating upon him for centuries. Now he opened his
heavy eyes, wrinkled his forehead, and the little hand that emerged
frailly from the enormous cuff wrote a few words in the great
volume. Then again he lapsed with half-shut eyes into his eternal
vigil over the strife of unhappy human beings. Her mind wandered.
She leant back against the hard wooden seat and let the tide of
oblivion flow over her. Scenes from her morning began to form
themselves; to obtrude themselves. Judd at the Committee; her
father reading the paper; the old woman plucking at her hand; the
parlourmaid sweeping the silver over the table; and Martin lighting
his second match in the jungle. . . .

She fidgeted. The air was fuggy; the light dim; and the Judge now
that the first glamour had worn off, looked fretful; no longer
immune from human weakness, and she remembered with a smile how
very gullible he was, there in that hideous house in Queen's Gate,
about old oak. "This I picked up at Whitby," he had said. And it
was a sham. She wanted to laugh; she wanted to move. She rose and
whispered:

"I'm going."

Her sister-in-law made a little murmur, perhaps of protest. But
Eleanor made her way as silently as she could through the swing
doors, out into the street.



The uproar, the confusion, the space of the Strand came upon her
with a shock of relief. She felt herself expand. It was still
daylight here; a rush, a stir, a turmoil of variegated life came
racing towards her. It was as if something had broken loose - in
her, in the world. She seemed, after her concentration, to be
dissipated, tossed about. She wandered along the Strand, looking
with pleasure at the racing street; at the shops full of bright
chains and leather cases; at the white-faced churches; at the
irregular jagged roofs laced across and across with wires. Above
was the dazzle of a watery but gleaming sky. The wind blew in her
face. She breathed in a gulp of fresh wet air. And that man, she
thought, thinking of the dark little Court and its cut-out faces,
has to sit there all day, every day. She saw Sanders Curry again,
lying back in his great chair, with his face falling in folds of
iron. Every day, all day, she thought, arguing points of law. How
could Morris stand it? But he had always wanted to go to the Bar.

Cabs, vans and omnibuses streamed past; they seemed to rush the air
into her face; they splashed the mud onto the pavement. People
jostled and hustled and she quickened her pace in time with theirs.
She was stopped by a van turning down one of the little steep
streets that led to the river. She looked up and saw the clouds
moving between the roofs, dark clouds, rain-swollen; wandering,
indifferent clouds. She walked on.

Again she was stopped at the entrance to Charing Cross station.
The sky was wide at that point. She saw a file of birds flying
high, flying together; crossing the sky. She watched them. Again
she walked on. People on foot, people in cabs were being sucked in
like straws round the piers of a bridge; she had to wait. Cabs
piled with boxes went past her.

She envied them. She wished she were going abroad; to Italy, to
India. . . . Then she felt vaguely that something was happening.
The paper boys at the gates were dealing out papers with unusual
rapidity. Men were snatching them and opening them and reading
them as they walked on. She looked at a placard that was crumpled
across a boy's legs. "Death" was written in very large black
letters.

Then the placard blew straight, and she read another word:
"Parnell."

"Dead" . . . she repeated. "Parnell." She was dazed for a
moment. How could he be dead - Parnell? She bought a paper. They
said so. . . .

"Parnell is dead!" she said aloud. She looked up and saw the sky
again; clouds were passing; she looked down into the street. A man
pointed at the news with his forefinger. Parnell is dead he was
saying. He was gloating. But how could he be dead? It was like
something fading in the sky.

She walked slowly along towards Trafalgar Square, holding the paper
in her hand. Suddenly the whole scene froze into immobility. A
man was joined to a pillar; a lion was joined to a man; they seemed
stilled, connected, as if they would never move again.

She crossed into Trafalgar Square. Birds chattered shrilly
somewhere. She stopped by the fountain and looked down into the
large basin full of water. The water rippled black as the wind
ruffled it. There were reflections in the water, branches and a
pale strip of sky. What a dream, she murmured; what a dream . . .
But someone jostled her. She turned. She must go to Delia. Delia
had cared. Delia had cared passionately. What was it she used to
say - flinging out of the house, leaving them all for the Cause, for
this man? Justice, Liberty? She must go to her. This would be
the end of all her dreams. She turned and hailed a cab.

She leant over the flaps of the cab looking out. The streets they
were driving through were horribly poor; and not only poor, she
thought, but vicious. Here was the vice, the obscenity, the
reality of London. It was lurid in the mixed evening light. Lamps
were being lit. Paper-boys were crying, Parnell . . . Parnell.
He's dead, she said to herself, still conscious of the two worlds;
one flowing in wide sweeps overhead, the other tip-tapping
circumscribed upon the pavement. But here she was . . . She held
up her hand. She stopped the cab opposite a little row of posts in
an alley. She got out and made her way into the Square.

The sound of the traffic was dulled. It was very silent here. In
the October afternoon, with dead leaves falling, the old faded
Square looked dingy and decrepit and full of mist. The houses were
let out in offices, to societies, to people whose names were pinned
up on the door-posts. The whole neighbourhood seemed to her
foreign and sinister. She came to the old Queen Anne doorway with
its heavy carved eyebrows and pressed the bell at the top of six or
seven bells. Names were written over them, sometimes only on
visiting-cards. Nobody came. She pushed the door open and went
in; she mounted the wooden stairs with carved banisters, that
seemed to have been degraded from their past dignity. Jugs of milk
with bills under them stood in the deep window-seats. Some of the
panes were broken. Outside Delia's door, at the top, there was a
milk-jug too, but it was empty. Her card was fixed by a drawing-
pin to a panel. She knocked and waited. There was no sound. She
turned the handle. The door was locked. She stood for a moment
listening. A little window at the side gave on to the square.
Pigeons crooned on the tree-tops. The traffic hummed far off; she
could just hear paperboys crying death . . . death . . . death.
The leaves were falling. She turned and went downstairs.

She strolled along the streets. Children had chalked the pavement
into squares; women leant from the upper windows, raking the street
with a rapacious, dissatisfied stare. Rooms were let out to single
gentlemen only. There were cards in them which said "Furnished
Apartments" or "Bed and Breakfast." She guessed at the life that
went on behind those thick yellow curtains. This was the purlieus
in which her sister lived, she thought, turning; she must often
come back this way at night alone. Then she went back to the
Square and climbed the stairs and rattled at the door again. But
there was no sound within. She stood for a moment watching the
leaves fall; she heard the paper-boys crying and the pigeons
crooning in the tree-tops. Take two coos, Taffy; take two coos,
Taffy; tak . . . Then a leaf fell.



The traffic at Charing Cross thickened as the afternoon wore on.
People on foot, people in cabs were being sucked in at the gates of
the station. Men swung along at a great pace as if there were some
demon in the station who would be enraged if they kept him waiting.
But even so they paused and snatched a paper as they passed. The
clouds parting and massing let the light shine and then veiled it.
The mud, now dark brown, now liquid gold, was splashed up by the
wheels and hooves, and in the general churn and uproar the shrill
chatter of the birds on the eaves was silenced. The hansoms
jingled and passed; jingled and passed. At last among all the
jingling cabs came one in which sat a stout red-faced man holding a
flower wrapped in tissue-paper - the Colonel.



"Hi!" he cried as the cab passed the gates; and drove one hand
through the trap-door in the roof. He leant out and a paper was
thrust up at him.

"Parnell!" he exclaimed, as he fumbled for his glasses. "Dead, by
Jove!"

The cab trotted on. He read the news two or three times over.
He's dead, he said, taking off his glasses. A shock of something
like relief, of something that had a tinge of triumph in it, went
through him as he leant back in the corner. Well, he said to
himself, he's dead - that unscrupulous adventurer - that agitator who
had done all the mischief, that man . . . Some feeling connected
with his own daughter here formed in him; he could not say exactly
what, but it made him frown. Anyhow he's dead now, he thought.
How had he died? Had he killed himself? It wouldn't  be
surprising. . . . Anyhow he was dead and that was an end of it.
He sat holding the paper crumpled in one hand, the flower wrapped
in tissue paper in the other, as the cab drove down Whitehall. . . .
One could respect him, he thought, as the cab passed the House
of Commons, which was more than could be said for some of the other
fellows . . . and there'd been a lot of nonsense talked about the
divorce case. He looked out. The cab was driving near a certain
street where he used to stop and look about him years ago. He
turned and glanced down a street to the right. But a man in public
life can't  afford to do those things, he thought. He gave a little
nod as the cab passed on. And now she's written to ask me for
money, he thought. The other chap had turned out, as he knew he
would, a bad egg. She'd lost all her looks, he was thinking; she
had grown very stout. Well, he could afford to be generous. He
put on his glasses again and read the City news.

It would make no difference, Parnell's death, coming now, he
thought. Had he lived, had the scandal died down - he looked up.
The cab was going the long way round as usual. "Left!" he shouted,
"Left!" as the driver, as they always did, took the wrong turning.



In the rather dark basement at Browne Street, the Italian
manservant was reading the paper in his shirt sleeves, when the
housemaid waltzed in carrying a hat.

"Look what she's given me!" she cried. To atone for the mess in
the drawing-room, Lady Pargiter had given her a hat. "Ain't  I
stylish?" she said, pausing in front of the glass with the great
Italian hat that looked as if it were made of spun glass on one
side of her head. And Antonio had to drop his paper and catch her
round the waist from sheer gallantry, since she was no beauty, and
her action was merely a parody of what he remembered in the hill
towns of Tuscany. But a cab stopped in front of the railings; two
legs stood still there, and he must detach himself, put on his
jacket and go upstairs to answer the bell.



He takes his time, the Colonel thought, as he stood on the door-
step waiting. The shock of the death had been absorbed almost; it
still swept round in his system; but did not prevent him from
thinking, as he stood there, that they had had the bricks re-
pointed; but how had they money to spare, with the three boys to
educate, and the two little girls? Eugénie was a clever woman of
course; but he wished she would get a parlourmaid instead of these
Italian dagoes who always seemed to be swallowing macaroni. Here
the door opened, and as he went upstairs he thought he heard, from
somewhere in the background, a shout of laughter.

He liked Eugénie's drawing-room, he thought, as he stood there
waiting. It was very untidy. There was a litter of shavings from
something that was being unpacked on the floor. They had been to
Italy, he remembered. A looking-glass stood on the table. It was
probably one of the things she had picked up there: the sort of
thing that people did pick up in Italy; an old glass, covered with
spots. He straightened his tie in front of it.

But I prefer a glass in which one can see oneself, he thought,
turning away. There was the piano open; and the tea - he smiled - 
with the cup half full as usual; and branches stuck about the room,
branches of withering red and yellow leaves. She liked flowers.
He was glad he had remembered to bring her his usual gift. He held
the flower wrapped in tissue paper in front of him. But why was
the room so full of smoke? A gust blew in. Both windows in the
back room were open, and the smoke was blowing in from the garden.
Were they burning weeds, he wondered? He walked to the window and
looked out. Yes, there they were - Eugénie and the two little
girls. There was a bonfire. As he looked, Magdalena, the little
girl who was his favourite, tossed a whole armful of dead leaves.
She jerked them as high as she could, and the fire blazed up. A
great fan of red flame flung out.

"That's dangerous!" he called out.

Eugénie pulled the children back. They were dancing with
excitement. The other little girl, Sara, ducked under her mother's
arm, seized another armful of leaves and flung them again. A great
fan of red flame flung out. Then the Italian servant came and
mentioned his name. He tapped on the window. Eugénie turned and
saw him. She held the children back with one hand and raised the
other in welcome.

"Stay where you are!" she cried. "We're coming!"

A cloud of smoke blew straight at him; it made his eyes water, and
he turned and sat down in the chair by the sofa. In another second
she came, hurrying towards him with both her hands stretched out.
He rose and took them.

"We're having a bonfire," she said. Her eyes were glowing; her
hair was looping down. "That's why I'm all so blown-about," she
added, putting her hand to her head. She was untidy, but extremely
handsome all the same, Abel thought. A fine large woman, growing
ample, he noted as she shook hands; but it suited her. He admired
that type more than the pink-and-white pretty Englishwoman. The
flesh flowed over her like warm yellow wax; she had great dark eyes
like a foreigner, and a nose with a ripple in it. He held out his
camellia; his customary gift. She made a little exclamation as she
took the flower from the tissue paper and sat down.

"How very good of you!" she said, and held it for a moment in front
of her, and then did what he had often seen her do with a flower - 
put the stalk between her lips. Her movements charmed him as
usual.

"Having a bonfire for the birthday?" he asked. . . . "No, no, no,"
he protested, "I don't  want tea."

She had taken her cup, and sipped the cold tea that was left in it.
As he watched her, some memory of the East came back to him; so
women sat in hot countries in their doorways in the sun. But it
was very cold at the moment with the window open and the smoke
blowing in. He still had his newspaper in his hand; he laid it on
the table.

"Seen the news?" he asked.

She put down her cup and slightly opened her large dark eyes.
Immense reserves of emotion seemed to dwell in them. As she waited
for him to speak, she raised her hand as if in expectation.

"Parnell," said Abel briefly. "He's dead."

"Dead?" Eugénie echoed him. She let her hand fall dramatically.

"Yes. At Brighton. Yesterday."

"Parnell is dead!" she repeated.

"So they say," said the Colonel. Her emotion always made him feel
more matter-of-fact; but he liked it. She took up the paper.

"Poor thing!" she exclaimed, letting it fall.

"Poor thing?" he repeated. Her eyes were full of tears. He was
puzzled. Did she mean Kitty O'Shea? He hadn't  thought of her.

"She ruined his career for him," he said with a little snort.

"Ah, but how she must have loved him!" she murmured.

She drew her hand over her eyes. The Colonel was silent for a
moment. Her emotion seemed to him out of all proportion to its
object; but it was genuine. He liked it.

"Yes," he said, rather stiffly. "Yes, I suppose so." Eugénie
picked up the flower again and held it, twirling it. She was oddly
absentminded now and then, but he always felt at his ease with her.
His body relaxed. He felt relieved of some obstruction in her
presence.

"How people suffer! . . ." she murmured, looking at the flower.
"How they suffer, Abel!" she said. She turned and looked straight
at him.

A great gust of smoke blew in from the other room.

"You don't  mind the draught?" he asked, looking at the window. She
did not answer at once; she was twirling her flower. Then she
roused herself and smiled.

"Yes, yes. Shut it!" she said with a wave of her hand. He went
and shut the window. When he turned round, she had got up and was
standing at the looking-glass, arranging her hair.

"We've  had a bonfire for Maggie's birthday," she murmured, looking
at herself in the Venetian glass that was covered with spots.
"That's why, that's why - " she smoothed her hair and fixed the
camellia in her dress. "I'm so very - "

She put her head a little on one side as if to observe the effect
of the flower in her dress. The Colonel sat down and waited. He
glanced at his paper.

"They seem to be hushing things up," he said.

"You don't  mean - " Eugénie was beginning; but here the door opened
and the children came in. Maggie, the elder, came first; the other
little girl, Sara, hung back behind her.

"Hullo!" the Colonel exclaimed. "Here they are!" He turned round.
He was very fond of children. "Many happy returns of the day to
you, Maggie!" He felt in his pocket for the necklace that Crosby
had done up in a cardboard box. Maggie came up to him to take it.
Her hair had been brushed, and she was dressed in a stiff clean
frock. She took the parcel and undid it; she held the blue-and-
gold necklace dangling from her finger. For a moment the Colonel
doubted whether she liked it. It looked a little garish as she
held it dangling in her hand. And she was silent. Her mother at
once supplied the words she should have spoken.

"How lovely, Maggie! How perfectly lovely!"

Maggie held the beads in her hand and said nothing.

"Thank Uncle Abel for the lovely necklace," her mother prompted
her.

"Thank you for the necklace, Uncle Abel," said Maggie. She spoke
directly and accurately, but the Colonel felt another twinge of
doubt. A pang of disappointment out of all proportion to its
object came over him. Her mother, however, fastened it round her
neck. Then she turned away to her sister, who was peeping from
behind a chair.

"Come, Sara," said her mother. "Come and say how-d'you-do."

She held out her hand partly to coax the little girl, partly, Abel
guessed, in order to conceal the very slight deformity that always
made him uncomfortable. She had been dropped when she was a baby;
one shoulder was slightly higher than the other; it made him feel
squeamish; he could not bear the least deformity in a child. It
did not affect her spirits, however. She skipped up to him,
whirling round on her toe, and kissed him lightly on the cheek.
Then she tugged at her sister's frock, and they both rushed away
into the back room laughing.

"They are going to admire your lovely present, Abel," said Eugénie.
"How you spoil them! - and me too," she added, touching the camellia
on her breast.

"I hope she liked it?" he asked. Eugénie did not answer him. She
had taken up the cup of cold tea again and was sipping it in her
indolent Southern manner.

"And now," she said, leaning back comfortably, "tell me all your
news."

The Colonel, too, lay back in his chair. He pondered for a moment.
What was his news? Nothing occurred to him on the spur of the
moment. With Eugénie, too, he always wanted to make a little
splash; she put a shine on things. While he hesitated, she began:

"We've  been having a wonderful time in Venice! I took the
children. That's why we're all so brown. We had rooms not on the
Grand Canal - I hate the Grand Canal - but just off it. Two weeks of
blazing sun; and the colours" - she hesitated - "marvellous!" she
exclaimed, "marvellous!" She threw out her hand. She had gestures
of extraordinary significance. That's how she rigs things up, he
thought. But he liked her for it.

He had not been to Venice for years.

"Any pleasant people there?" he asked.

"Not a soul," she said. "Not a soul. No one except a dreadful
Miss - . One of those women who make one ashamed of one's country,"
she said energetically.

"I know 'em," he chuckled.

"But coming back from the Lido in the evening," she resumed, "with
the clouds above and the water below - we had a balcony; we used to
sit there." She paused.

"Was Digby with you?" the Colonel asked.

"No, poor Digby. He took his holiday earlier, in August. He was
up in Scotland with the Lasswades shooting. It does him good, you
know." There she goes, rigging thing's up again, he thought.

But she resumed.

"Now tell me about the family. Martin and Eleanor, Hugh and Milly,
Morris and . . ." She hesitated; he suspected that she had
forgotten the name of Morris' wife.

"Celia," he said. He stopped. He wanted to tell her about Mira.
But he told her about the family: Hugh and Milly; Morris and Celia.
And Edward.

"They seem to think a lot of him at Oxford," he said gruffly. He
was very proud of Edward.

"And Delia?" said Eugénie. She glanced at the paper. The Colonel
at once lost his affability. He looked glum and formidable, like
an old bull with his head down, she thought.

"Perhaps it will bring her to her senses," he said sternly. They
were silent for a moment. There were shouts of laughter from the
garden.

"Oh those children!" she exclaimed. She rose and went to the
window. The Colonel followed her. The children had stolen back
into the garden. The bonfire was burning fiercely. A clear pillar
of flame rose in the middle of the garden. The little girls were
laughing and shouting as they danced round it. A shabby old man,
something like a decayed groom to look at, stood there with a rake
in his hand. Eugénie flung up the window and cried out. But they
went on dancing. The Colonel leant out too; they looked like wild
creatures with their hair flying. He would have liked to go down
and jump over the bonfire, but he was too old. The flames leapt
high - clear gold, bright red.

"Bravo!" he cried, clapping his hands. "Bravo!"

"Little demons!" said Eugénie. She was as much excited as they
were, he observed. She leant out of the window and cried to the
old man with the rake:

"Make it blaze! Make it blaze!"

But the old man was raking out the fire. The sticks were
scattered. The flames had sunk.

The old man pushed the children away.

"Well, that's over," said Eugénie, heaving a sigh. She turned.
Someone had come into the room.

"Oh, Digby, I never heard you!" she exclaimed. Digby stood there
with a case in his hands.



"Hullo, Digby!" said Abel, shaking hands.

"What's all this smoke?" said Digby, looking round him.

He's aged a bit, Abel thought. There he stood in his frock coat
with the top buttons undone. His coat was a little threadbare; his
hair was white on top. But he was very handsome; beside him the
Colonel felt large, weather-beaten and rough. He was a little
ashamed that he had been caught leaning out of the window clapping
his hands. He looks older, he thought, as they stood side by side;
yet he's five years younger than I am. He was a distinguished man
in his way; the top of his tree; a knight and all the rest of it.
But he's not as rich as I am, he remembered with satisfaction; for
he had always been the failure of the two.

"You look so tired, Digby!" Eugénie exclaimed, sitting down. "He
ought to take a real holiday," she said, turning to Abel. "I wish
you'd tell him so." Digby brushed away a white thread that had
stuck to his trousers. He coughed slightly. The room was full of
smoke.

"What's all this smoke for?" he asked his wife.

"We've  been having a bonfire for Maggie's birthday," she said as if
excusing herself.

"Oh yes," he said. Abel was irritated; Maggie was his favourite;
her father ought to have remembered her birthday.

"Yes," said Eugénie, turning to Abel again, "he lets everybody else
take a holiday, but he never takes one himself. And then, when
he's done a full day's work at the office, he comes back with his
bag full of papers - " She pointed at the bag.

"You shouldn't  work after dinner," said Abel. "That's a bad
habit." Digby did look a bit off-colour, he thought. Digby
brushed aside this feminine effusiveness.

"Seen the news?" he said to his brother, indicating the paper.

"Yes. By Jove!" said Abel. He liked talking politics with his
brother, though he slightly resented his official airs as if he
could say more but must not. And then it's all in the papers the
day after, he thought. Still they always talked politics. Eugénie
lying back in her corner always let them talk; she never
interrupted. But at length she got up and began tidying the litter
that had fallen from the packing-case. Digby stopped what he was
saying and watched her. He was looking at the glass.

"Like it?" said Eugénie, with her hand on the frame.

"Yes," said Digby; but there was a hint of criticism in his voice.
"Quite a pretty one."

"It's only for my bedroom," she said quickly. Digby watched her
stuffing the bits of paper into the box.

"Remember," he said, "we're dining with the Chathams tonight."

"I know." She touched her hair again. "I shall have to make
myself tidy," she said. Who were "the Chathams?" Abel wondered.
Bigwigs, mandarins, he supposed half contemptuously. They moved a
great deal in that world. He took it as a hint that he should go.
They had come to the end of what they had to say to each other - he
and Digby. He still hoped, however, that he might talk with
Eugénie alone.

"About this African business - " he began, bethinking him of another
question - when the children came in; they had come to say good-
night. Maggie was wearing his necklace and it looked very pretty,
he thought, or was it she who looked so pretty? But their frocks,
their clean blue and pink frocks, were crumpled; they were smudged
with the sooty London leaves that they had been holding in their
arms.

"Grubby little ruffians!" he said, smiling at them. "Why d'you
wear your best clothes to play in the garden?" said Sir Digby, as
he kissed Maggie. He said it jokingly, but there was a hint of
disapproval in his tones. Maggie made no answer. Her eyes were
riveted on the camellia that her mother wore in the front of her
dress. She went up and stood looking at her.

"And you - what a little sweep!" said Sir Digby, pointing to Sara.

"It's Maggie's birthday," said Eugénie, holding out her arm again
as if to protect the little girl.

"That is a reason, I should have thought," said Sir Digby,
surveying his daughters, "to - er - to - er - reform one's habits." He
stumbled, trying to make his sentence sound playful; but it turned
out as it generally did when he talked to the children, lame and
rather pompous.

Sara looked at her father as if she were considering him.

"To - er - to - er - reform one's habits," she repeated. Emptied of
all meaning, she had got the rhythm of his words exactly. The
effect was somehow comic. The Colonel laughed; but Digby, he felt,
was annoyed. He only patted Sara on the head when she came to say
good-night; but he kissed Maggie as she passed him.

"Had a nice birthday?" he said, pulling her to him. Abel made it
an excuse to go.

"But there is no need for you to go yet, Abel?" Eugénie protested
as he held out his hand.

She kept hold of his hand as if to prevent him from going. What
did she mean? Did she want him to stay, did she want him to go?
Her eyes, her large dark eyes, were ambiguous.

"But you're dining out?" he said.

"Yes," she replied, letting his hand fall, and as she said no more
there was nothing for it, he supposed - he must take himself off.

"Oh, I can find my way out alone," he said as he left the room.

He went downstairs rather slowly. He felt depressed and
disappointed. He had not seen her alone; he had not told her
anything. Perhaps he never would tell anybody anything. After
all, he thought as he went downstairs, slowly, heavily, it was his
own affair; it didn't  matter to anybody else. One must burn one's
own smoke, he thought as he took his hat. He glanced round.

Yes . . . the house was full of pretty things. He looked vaguely
at a great crimson chair with gilt claws that stood in the hall.
He envied Digby his house, his wife, his children. He was getting
old, he felt. All his children were grown-up; they had left him.
He paused on the doorstep and looked out into the street. It was
quite dark; lamps were lit; the autumn was drawing in; and as he
marched up the dark windy street, now spotted with raindrops, a
puff of smoke blew full in his face; and leaves were falling.



1907


It was midsummer; and the nights were hot. The moon, falling on
water, made it white, inscrutable, whether deep or shallow. But
where the moonlight fell on solid objects it gave them a burnish
and a silver plating, so that even the leaves in country roads
seemed varnished. All along the silent country roads leading to
London carts plodded; the iron reins fixed in the iron hands, for
vegetables, fruit, flowers travelled slowly. Heaped high with
round crates of cabbage, cherries, carnations, they looked like
caravans piled with the goods of tribes migrating in search of
water, driven by enemies to seek new pasturage. On they plodded,
down this road, that road, keeping close to the kerb. Even the
horses, had they been blind, could have heard the hum of London in
the distance; and the drivers, dozing, yet saw through half shut
eyes the fiery gauze of the eternally burning city. At dawn, at
Covent Garden, they laid down their burdens; tables and trestles,
even the cobbles were frilled as with some celestial laundry with
cabbages, cherries and carnations.

All the windows were open. Music sounded. From behind crimson
curtains, rendered semi-transparent and sometimes blowing wide came
the sound of the eternal waltz - After the ball is over, after the
dance is done - like a serpent that swallowed its own tail, since
the ring was complete from Hammersmith to Shoreditch. Over and
over again it was repeated by trombones outside public houses;
errand boys whistled it; bands inside private rooms where people
were dancing played it. There they sat at little tables at Wapping
in the romantic Inn that overhung the river, between timber
warehouses where barges were moored; and here again in Mayfair.
Each table had its lamp; its canopy of tight red silk, and the
flowers that had sucked damp from the earth that noon relaxed and
spread their petals in vases. Each table had its pyramid of
strawberries, its pale plump quail; and Martin, after India, after
Africa, found it exciting to talk to a girl with bare shoulders, to
a woman iridescent with green beetles wings in her hair in a manner
that the waltz condoned and half concealed under its amorous
blandishments. Did it matter what one said? For she looked over
her shoulder, only half listening, as a man came in wearing
decorations, and a lady, in black with diamonds, beckoned him to a
private corner.

As the night wore on a tender blue light lay on the market carts
still plodding close to the kerb, past Westminster, past the yellow
round clocks, the coffee stalls and the statues that stood there in
the dawn holding so stiffly their rods or rolls of paper. And the
scavengers followed after, sluicing the pavements. Cigarette ends,
little bits of silver paper, orange peel - all the litter of the day
was swept off the pavement and still the carts plodded, and the
cabs trotted, indefatigably, along the dowdy pavements of
Kensington, under the sparkling lights of Mayfair, carrying ladies
with high head dresses and gentlemen in white waistcoats along the
hammered dry roads which looked in the moonlight as if they were
plated with silver.

"Look!" said Eugénie as the cab trotted over the bridge in the
summer twilight. "Isn't  that lovely?"

She waved her hand at the water. They were crossing the
Serpentine; but her exclamation was only an aside; she was
listening to what her husband was saying. Their daughter Magdalena
was with them; and she looked where her mother pointed. There was
the Serpentine, red in the setting sun; the trees grouped together,
sculptured, losing their detail; and the ghostly architecture of
the little bridge, white at the end, composed the scene. The
lights - the sun-light and the artificial light - were strangely
mixed.

". . . of course it's put the Government in a fix," Sir Digby was
saying. "But then that's what he wants."

"Yes . . . he'll make a name for himself, that young man," said
Lady Pargiter.

The cab passed over the bridge. It entered the shadow of the
trees. Now it left the Park and joined the long line of cabs,
taking people in evening dress to plays, to dinner-parties, that
was streaming towards the Marble Arch. The light grew more and
more artificial; yellower and yellower. Eugénie leant across and
touched something on her daughter's dress. Maggie looked up. She
had thought that they were still talking politics.

"So," said her mother, arranging the flower in front of her dress.
She put her head a little on one side and looked at her daughter
approvingly. Then she gave a sudden laugh and threw her hand out.
"D'you know what made me so late?" she said. "That imp, Sally . . ."

But her husband interrupted her. He had caught sight of an
illuminated clock.

"We shall be late," he said.

"But eight-fifteen means eight-thirty," said Eugénie as they turned
down a side street.



All was silent in the house at Browne Street. A ray from the
street lamp fell through the fanlight and, rather capriciously, lit
up a tray of glasses on the hall table; a top hat; and a chair with
gilt paws. The chair, standing empty, as if waiting for someone,
had a look of ceremony; as if it stood on the cracked floor of some
Italian ante-room. But all was silent. Antonio, the man servant,
was asleep; Mollie, the housemaid, was asleep; downstairs in the
basement a door flapped to and fro - otherwise all was silent.



Sally in her bedroom at the top of the house turned on her side and
listened intently. She thought she heard the front door click. A
burst of dance music came in through the open window and made it
impossible to hear.

She sat up in bed and looked out through the slit of the blind.
Through the gap she could see a slice of the sky; then roofs; then
the tree in the garden; then the backs of houses opposite standing
in a long row. One of the houses was brilliantly lit and from the
long open windows came dance music. They were waltzing. She saw
shadows twirling across the blind. It was impossible to read;
impossible to sleep. First there was the music; then a burst of
talk; then people came out into the garden; voices chattered, then
the music began again.

It was a hot summer's night, and though it was late, the whole
world seemed to be alive; the rush of traffic sounded distant but
incessant.

A faded brown book lay on her bed; as if she had been reading. But
it was impossible to read; impossible to sleep. She lay back on
the pillow with her hands behind her head.

"And he says," she murmured, "the world is nothing but . . ." She
paused. What did he say? Nothing but thought, was it? she asked
herself as if she had already forgotten. Well, since it was
impossible to read and impossible to sleep, she would let herself
BE thought. It was easier to act things than to think them. Legs,
body, hands, the whole of her must be laid out passively to take
part in this universal process of thinking which the man said was
the world living. She stretched herself out. Where did thought
begin?

In the feet? she asked. There they were, jutting out under the
single sheet. They seemed separated, very far away. She closed
her eyes. Then against her will something in her hardened. It was
impossible to act thought. She became something; a root; lying
sunk in the earth; veins seemed to thread the cold mass; the tree
put forth branches; the branches had leaves.

" - the sun shines through the leaves," she said, waggling her
finger. She opened her eyes in order to verify the sun on the
leaves and saw the actual tree standing out there in the garden.
Far from being dappled with sunlight, it had no leaves at all. She
felt for a moment as if she had been contradicted. For the tree
was black, dead black.

She leant her elbow on the sill and looked out at the tree. A
confused clapping sound came from the room where they were having
the dance. The music had stopped; people began to come down the
iron staircase into the garden which was marked out with blue and
yellow lamps dotted along the wall. The voices grew louder. More
people came and more people came. The dotted square of green was
full of the flowing pale figures of women in evening dress; of the
upright black-and-white figures of men in evening dress. She
watched them moving in and out. They were talking and laughing;
but they were too far off for her to hear what they were saying.
Sometimes a single word or a laugh rose above the rest, and then
there was a confused babble of sound. In their own garden all was
empty and silent. A cat slid stealthily along the top of a wall;
stopped; and then went on again as if drawn on some secret errand.
Another dance struck up.

"Over again, over and over again!" she exclaimed impatiently. The
air, laden with the curious dry smell of London earth, puffed in
her face, blowing the blind out. Stretched flat on her bed, she
saw the moon; it seemed immensely high above her. Little vapours
were moving across the surface. Now they parted and she saw
engravings chased over the white disc. What were they, she
wondered - mountains? valleys? And if valleys, she said to herself
half closing her eyes, then white trees; then icy hollows, and
nightingales, two nightingales calling to each other, calling and
answering each other across the valleys. The waltz music took the
words "calling and answering each other" and flung them out; but as
it repeated the same rhythm again and again, it coarsened them, it
destroyed them. The dance music interfered with everything. At
first exciting, then it became boring and finally intolerable. Yet
it was only twenty minutes to one.

Her lip raised itself, like that of a horse that is going to bite.
The little brown book was dull. She reached her hand above her
head and took down another book from the shelf of battered books
without looking at it. She opened the book at random; but her eye
was caught by one of the couples who were still sitting out in the
garden though the others had gone in. What were they saying, she
wondered? There was something gleaming in the grass, and, as far
as she could see, the black-and-white figure stooped and picked it
up.

"And as he picks it up," she murmured, looking out, "he says to the
lady beside him: Behold, Miss Smith, what I have found on the
grass - a fragment of my heart; of my broken heart, he says. I have
found it in the grass; and I wear it on my breast" - she hummed the
words in time to the melancholy waltz music - "my broken heart, this
broken glass, for love - " she paused and glanced at the book. On
the fly-leaf was written:

"Sara Pargiter from her Cousin Edward Pargiter."

". . . for love," she concluded, "is best."

She turned to the title-page.

"The Antigone of Sophocles, done into English verse by Edward
Pargiter," she read.

Once more she looked out of the window. The couple had moved.
They were going up the iron staircase. She watched them. They
went into the ballroom. "And suppose in the middle of the dance,"
she murmured, 'she takes it out; and looks at it and says, 'What is
this?' and it's only a piece of broken glass - of broken glass. . . ."
She looked down at the book again.

"The Antigone of Sophocles," she read. The book was brand-new; it
cracked as she opened it; this was the first time she had opened
it.

"The Antigone of Sophocles, done into English verse by Edward
Pargiter," she read again. He had given it her in Oxford; one hot
afternoon when they had been trailing through chapels and
libraries. "Trailing and wailing," she hummed, turning over the
pages, "and he said to me, getting up from the low armchair, and
brushing his hand through his hair" - she glanced out of the window - 
"'my wasted youth, my wasted youth.'" The waltz was now at its
most intense, its most melancholy. "Taking in his hand," she
hummed in time to it, "this broken glass, this faded heart, he said
to me . . ." Here the music stopped; there was a sound of
clapping; the dancers once more came out into the garden.

She skipped through the pages. At first she read a line or two at
random; then, from the litter of broken words, scenes rose,
quickly, inaccurately, as she skipped. The unburied body of a
murdered man lay like a fallen tree-trunk, like a statue, with one
foot stark in the air. Vultures gathered. Down they flopped on
the silver sand. With a lurch, with a reel, the top-heavy birds
came waddling; with a flap of the grey throat swinging, they
hopped - she beat her hand on the counterpane as she read - to that
lump there. Quick, quick, quick with repeated jerks they struck
the mouldy flesh. Yes. She glanced at the tree outside in the
garden. The unburied body of the murdered man lay on the sand.
Then in a yellow cloud came whirling - who? She turned the page
quickly. Antigone? She came whirling out of the dust-cloud to
where the vultures were reeling and flung white sand over the
blackened foot. She stood there letting fall white dust over the
blackened foot. Then behold! there were more clouds; dark clouds;
the horsemen leapt down; she was seized; her wrists were bound with
withies; and they bore her, thus bound - where?

There was a roar of laughter from the garden. She looked up.
Where did they take her? she asked. The garden was full of people.
She could not hear a word that they were saying. The figures were
moving in and out.

"To the estimable court of the respected ruler?" she murmured,
picking up a word or two at random, for she was still looking out
into the garden. The man's name was Creon. He buried her. It was
a moonlight night. The blades of the cactuses were sharp silver.
The man in the loincloth gave three sharp taps with his mallet on
the brick. She was buried alive. The tomb was a brick mound.
There was just room for her to lie straight out. Straight out in a
brick tomb, she said. And that's the end, she yawned, shutting the
book.

She laid herself out, under the cold smooth sheets, and pulled the
pillow over her ears. The one sheet and the one blanket fitted
softly round her. At the bottom of the bed was a long stretch of
cool fresh mattress. The sound of the dance music became dulled.
Her body dropped suddenly; then reached ground. A dark wing
brushed her mind, leaving a pause; a blank space. Everything - the
music, the voices - became stretched and generalised. The book fell
on the floor. She was asleep.

"It's a lovely night," said the girl who was going up the iron
steps with her partner. She rested her hand on the balustrade. It
felt very cold. She looked up; a slice of yellow light lay round
the moon. It seemed to laugh round it. Her partner looked up too,
and then mounted another step without saying anything for he was
shy.

"Going to the match tomorrow?" he said stiffly, for they scarcely
knew each other.

"If my brother gets off in time to take me," she said, and went up
another step too. Then, as they entered the ballroom, he gave her
a little bow and left her; for his partner was waiting.

The moon which was now clear of clouds lay in a bare space as if
the light had consumed the heaviness of the clouds and left a
perfectly clear pavement, a dancing ground for revelry. For some
time the dappled iridescence of the sky remained unbroken. Then
there was a puff of wind; and a little cloud crossed the moon.



There was a sound in the bedroom. Sara turned over.

"Who's that?" she murmured. She sat up and rubbed her eyes.

It was her sister. She stood at the door, hesitating. "Asleep?"
she said in a low voice.

"No," said Sara. She rubbed her eyes. "I'm awake," she said,
opening them.

Maggie came across the room and sat down on the edge of the bed.
The blind was blowing out; the sheets were slipping off the bed.
She felt dazed for a moment. After the ballroom, it looked so
untidy. There was a tumbler with a toothbrush in it on the wash-
stand; the towel was crumpled on the towel-horse; and a book had
fallen on the floor. She stooped and picked up the book. As she
did so, the music burst out down the street. She held back the
blind. The women in pale dresses, the men in black and white, were
crowding up the stairs into the ballroom. Snatches of talk and
laughter were blown across the garden.

"Is there a dance?" she asked.

"Yes. Down the street," said Sara.

Maggie looked out. At this distance the music sounded romantic,
mysterious, and the colours flowed over each other, neither pink
nor white nor blue.

Maggie stretched herself and unpinned the flower that she was
wearing. It was drooping; the white petals were stained with black
marks. She looked out of the window again. The mixture of lights
was very odd; one leaf was a lurid green; another was a bright
white. The branches crossed each other at different levels. Then
Sally laughed.

"Did anybody give you a piece of glass," she said, 'saying to you,
Miss Pargiter . . . my broken heart?"

"No," said Maggie, "why should they?" The flower fell off her lap
onto the floor.

"I was thinking," said Sara. "The people in the garden . . ."

She waved her hand at the window. They were silent for a moment,
listening to the dance music.

"And who did you sit next?" Sara asked after a time.

"A man in gold lace," said Maggie.

"In gold lace?" Sara repeated.

Maggie was silent. She was getting used to the room; the
discrepancy between this litter and the shiny ballroom was leaving
her. She envied her sister lying in bed with the window open and
the breeze blowing in.

"Because he was going to a party," she said. She paused.
Something had caught her eye. A branch swayed up and down in the
little breeze. Maggie held the blind so that the window was
uncurtained. Now she could see the whole sky, and the houses and
the branches in the garden.

"It's the moon," she said. It was the moon that was making the
leaves white. They both looked at the moon, which shone like a
silver coin, perfectly polished, very sharp and hard.

"But if they don't  say O my broken heart," said Sara, "what do they
say, at parties?"

Maggie flicked off a white fleck that had stuck to her arm from her
gloves.

"Some people say one thing," she said, getting up, "and some people
say another."

She picked up the little brown book which lay on the counterpane
and smoothed out the bedclothes. Sara took the book out of her
hand.

"This man," she said, tapping the ugly little brown volume, 'says
the world's nothing but thought, Maggie."

"Does he?" said Maggie, putting the book on the wash-stand. It was
a device, she knew, to keep her standing there, talking.

"D'you think it's true?" Sara asked.

"Possibly," said Maggie, without thinking what she was saying. She
put out her hand to draw the curtain.

"The world's nothing but thought, does he say?" she repeated,
holding the curtain apart.

She had been thinking something of the kind when the cab crossed
the Serpentine; when her mother interrupted her. She had been
thinking, Am I that, or am I this? Are we one, or are we separate - 
something of the kind.

"Then what about trees and colours?" she said, turning round.

"Trees and colours?" Sara repeated.

"Would there be trees if we didn't  see them?" said Maggie.

"What's 'I'? . . . 'I' . . ." She stopped. She did not know what
she meant. She was talking nonsense.

"Yes," said Sara. "What's 'I'?" She held her sister tight by the
skirt, whether she wanted to prevent her from going, or whether she
wanted to argue the question.

"What's 'I'?" she repeated.

But there was a rustling outside the door and her mother came in.



"Oh my dear children!" she exclaimed, 'still out of bed? Still
talking?"

She came across the room, beaming, glowing, as if she were still
under the influence of the party. Jewels flashed on her neck and
her arms. She was extraordinarily handsome. She glanced round
her.

"And the flower's on the floor, and everything's so untidy," she
said. She picked up the flower that Maggie had dropped and put it
to her lips.

"Because I was reading, Mama, because I was waiting," said Sara.
She took her mother's hand and stroked the bare arm. She imitated
her mother's manner so exactly that Maggie smiled. They were the
very opposite of each other - Lady Pargiter so sumptuous; Sally so
angular. But it's worked, she thought to herself, as Lady Pargiter
allowed herself to be pulled down onto the bed. The imitation had
been perfect.

"But you must go to sleep, Sal," she protested. "What did the
doctor say? Lie straight, lie still, he said." She pushed her
back onto the pillows.

"I am lying straight and still," said Sara. "Now" - she looked up
at her - "tell me about the party."

Maggie stood upright in the window. She watched the couples coming
down the iron staircase. Soon the garden was full of pale whites
and pinks, moving in and out. She half heard them behind her
talking about the party.

"It was a very nice party," her mother was saying.

Maggie looked out of the window. The square of the garden was
filled with differently tinted colours. They seemed to ripple one
over the other until they entered the angle where the light from
the house fell, when they suddenly turned to ladies and gentlemen
in full evening dress.

"No fish-knives?" she heard Sara saying.

She turned.

"Who was the man I sat next?" she asked.

"Sir Matthew Mayhew," said Lady Pargiter.

"Who is Sir Matthew Mayhew?" said Maggie.

"A most distinguished man, Maggie!" said her mother, flinging her
hand out.

"A most distinguished man," Sara echoed her.

"But he is," Lady Pargiter repeated, smiling at her daughter whom
she loved, perhaps because of her shoulder.

"It was a great honour to sit next him, Maggie," she continued. "A
great honour," she said reprovingly. She paused, as if she saw a
little scene. She looked up.

"And then," she resumed, "when Mary Palmer says to me, Which is
your daughter? I see Maggie, miles away, at the other end of the
room, talking to Martin, whom she might have met every day of her
life in an omnibus!"

Her words were stressed so that they seemed to rise and fall. She
emphasised the rhythm still further by tapping with her fingers on
Sally's bare arm.

"But I don't  see Martin every day," Maggie protested.

"I haven't  seen him since he came back from Africa." Her mother
interrupted her.

"But you don't  go to parties, my dear Maggie, to talk to your own
cousins. You go to parties to - "

Here the dance music crashed out. The first chords seemed
possessed of frantic energy, as if they were summoning the dancers
imperiously to return. Lady Pargiter stopped in the middle of her
sentence. She sighed; her body seemed to become indolent and
suave. The heavy lids lowered themselves slightly over her large
dark eyes. She swayed her head slowly in time to the music.

"What's that they're playing?" she murmured. She hummed the tune,
beating time with her hand. "Something I used to dance to."

"Dance it now, Mama," said Sara.

"Yes, Mama. Show us how you used to dance," Maggie urged her.

"But without a partner - ?" Lady Pargiter protested.

Maggie pushed a chair away.

"Imagine a partner," Sara urged her.

"Well," said Lady Pargiter. She rose. "It was something like
this," she said. She paused; she held her skirt out with one hand;
she slightly crooked the other in which she held the flower; she
twirled round and round in the space which Maggie had cleared. She
moved with extraordinary stateliness. All her limbs seemed to bend
and flow in the lilt and the curve of the music; which became
louder and clearer as she danced to it. She circled in and out
among the chairs and tables and then, as the music stopped,
"There!" she exclaimed. Her body seemed to fold and close itself
together as she sighed "There!" and sank all in one movement on the
edge of the bed.

"Wonderful!" Maggie exclaimed. Her eyes rested on her mother with
admiration.

"Nonsense," Lady Pargiter laughed, panting slightly. "I'm much too
old to dance now; but when I was young; when I was your age - " She
sat there panting.

"You danced out of the house onto the terrace and found a little
note folded in your bouquet - " said Sara, stroking her mother's
arm. "Tell us that story, Mama."

"Not tonight," said Lady Pargiter. "Listen - there's the clock
striking!"

Since the Abbey was so near, the sound of the hour filled the room;
softly, tumultuously, as if it were a flurry of soft sighs hurrying
one on top of another, yet concealing something hard. Lady
Pargiter counted. It was very late.

"I'll tell you the true story one of these days," she said as she
bent to kiss her daughter goodnight.

"Now! Now!" cried Sara, holding her fast.

"No, not now - not now!" Lady Pargiter laughed, snatching away her
hand. "There's Papa calling me!"

They heard footsteps in the passage outside, and then Sir Digby's
voice at the door.

"Eugénie! It's very late, Eugénie!" they heard him say.

"Coming!" she cried. "Coming!"

Sara caught her by the train of her dress. "You haven't  told us
the story of the bouquet, Mamma!" she cried.

"Eugénie!" Sir Digby repeated. His voice sounded peremptory.
"Have you locked - "

"Yes, yes, yes," said Eugénie. "I will tell you the true story
another time," she said, freeing herself from her daughter's grasp.
She kissed them both quickly and went out of the room.



"She won't  tell us," said Maggie, picking up her gloves. She spoke
with some bitterness.

They listened to the voices talking in the passage. They could
hear their father's voice. He was expostulating. His voice
sounded querulous and cross.

"Pirouetting up and down with his sword between his legs; with his
opera hat under his arm and his sword between his legs," said Sara,
pummelling her pillows viciously.

The voices went further away, downstairs.

"Who was the note from, d'you think?" said Maggie. She paused,
looking at her sister burrowing into her pillows.

"The note? What note?" said Sara. "Oh, the note in the bouquet.
I don't  remember," she said. She yawned.

Maggie shut the window and pulled the curtain but she left a chink
of light.

"Pull it tight, Maggie," said Sara irritably. "Shut out that din."

She curled herself up with her back to the window. She had raised
a hump of pillow against her head as if to shut out the dance music
that was still going on. She pressed her face into a cleft of the
pillows. She looked like a chrysalis wrapped round in the sharp
white folds of the sheet. Only the tip of her nose was visible.
Her hip and her feet jutted out at the end of the bed covered by a
single sheet. She gave a profound sigh that was half a snore; she
was asleep already.



Maggie went along the passage. Then she saw that there were lights
in the hall beneath. She stopped and looked down over the
banister. The hall was lit up. She could see the great Italian
chair with the gilt claws that stood in the hall. Her mother had
thrown her evening cloak over it, so that it fell in soft golden
folds over the crimson cover. She could see a tray with whisky and
a soda-water syphon on the hall table. Then she heard the voices
of her father and mother as they came up the kitchen stairs. They
had been down in the basement; there had been a burglary up the
street; her mother had promised to have a new lock put on the
kitchen door but had forgotten. She could hear her father say:

". . . they'd melt it down; we should never get it back again."

Maggie went on a few steps upstairs.

"I'm so sorry, Digby," Eugénie said as they came into the hall.
"I will tie a knot in my handkerchief; I will go directly after
breakfast tomorrow morning. . . . Yes," she said, gathering her
cloak in her arms, "I will go myself, and I will say 'I've  had
enough of your excuses, Mr Toye. No, Mr Toye, you have deceived me
once too often. And after all these years!'"

Then there was a pause. Maggie could hear soda-water squirted into
a tumbler; the chink of a glass; and then the lights went out.



1908


It was March and the wind was blowing. But it was not "blowing."
It was scraping, scourging. It was so cruel. So unbecoming. Not
merely did it bleach faces and raise red spots on noses; it tweaked
up skirts; showed stout legs; made trousers reveal skeleton shins.
There was no roundness, no fruit in it. Rather it was like the
curve of a scythe which cuts, not corn, usefully; but destroys,
revelling in sheer sterility. With one blast it blew out colour - 
even a Rembrandt in the National Gallery, even a solid ruby in a
Bond Street window: one blast and they were gone. Had it any
breeding place it was in the Isle of Dogs among tin cans lying
beside a workhouse drab on the banks of a polluted city. It tossed
up rotten leaves, gave them another span of degraded existence;
scorned, derided them, yet had nothing to put in the place of the
scorned, the derided. Down they fell. Uncreative, unproductive,
yelling its joy in destruction, its power to peel off the bark, the
bloom, and show the bare bone, it paled every window; drove old
gentlemen further and further into the leather smelling recesses of
clubs; and old ladies to sit eyeless, leather cheeked, joyless
among the tassels and antimacassars of their bedrooms and kitchens.
Triumphing in its wantonness it emptied the streets; swept flesh
before it; and coming smack against a dust cart standing outside
the Army and Navy Stores, scattered along the pavement a litter of
old envelopes; twists of hair; papers already blood smeared, yellow
smeared, smudged with print and sent them scudding to plaster legs,
lamp posts, pillar boxes, and fold themselves frantically against
area railings.



Matty Stiles, the caretaker, huddled in the basement of the house
in Browne Street, looked up. There was a rattle of dust along the
pavement. It worked its way under the doors, through the window
frames; on to chests and dressers. But she didn't  care. She was
one of the unlucky ones. She had been thinking it was a safe job,
sure to last the summer out anyhow. The lady was dead; the
gentleman too. She had got the job through her son the policeman.
The house with its basement would never let this side of Christmas - 
so they told her. She had only to show parties round who came
with orders to view from the agent. And she always mentioned the
basement - how damp it was. "Look at that stain on the ceiling."
There it was, sure enough. All the same, the party from China took
a fancy to it. It suited him, he said. He had business in the
city. She was one of the unlucky ones - after three months to turn
out and lodge with her son in Pimlico.

A bell rang. Let him ring, ring, ring, she growled. She wasn't 
going to open the door any more. There he was standing on the
door-step. She could see a pair of legs against the railing. Let
him ring as much as he liked. The house was sold. Couldn't  he see
the notice on the board? Couldn't  he read it? Hadn't  he eyes?
She huddled closer to the fire, which was covered with pale ash.
She could see his legs there, standing on the door-step, between
the canaries' cage and the dirty linen which she had been going to
wash, but this wind made her shoulder ache cruel. Let him ring the
house down, for all she cared.



Martin was standing there.

"Sold" was written on a strip of bright red paper pasted across the
house-agent's board.

"Already!" said Martin. He had made a little circle to look at the
house in Browne Street. And it was already sold. The red strip
gave him a shock. It was sold already, and Digby had only been
dead three months - Eugénie not much more than a year. He stood for
a moment gazing at the black windows now grimed with dust. It was
a house of character; built some time in the eighteenth century.
Eugénie had been proud of it. And I used to like going there, he
thought. But now an old newspaper was on the door-step; wisps of
straw had caught in the railings; and he could see, for there were
no blinds, into an empty room. A woman was peering up at him from
behind the bars of a cage in the basement. It was no use ringing.
He turned away. A feeling of something extinguished came over him
as he went down the street.

It's a grimy, it's a sordid end, he thought; I used to enjoy going
there. But he disliked brooding over unpleasant thoughts. What's
the good of it? he asked himself.

"The King of Spain's daughter," he hummed as he turned the corner,
"came to visit me . . ."



"And how much longer," he asked himself, pressing the bell, as he
stood on the door-step of the house in Abercorn Terrace, "is old
Crosby going to keep me waiting?" The wind was very cold.

He stood there, looking at the buff-coloured front of the large,
architecturally insignificant, but no doubt convenient family
mansion in which his father and sister still lived. "She takes her
time nowadays," he thought, shivering in the wind. But here the
door opened, and Crosby appeared.

"Hullo, Crosby!" he said.

She beamed on him so that her gold tooth showed. He was always her
favourite, they said, and the thought pleased him today.

"How's the world treating you?" he asked, as he gave her his hat.

She was just the same - more shrivelled, more gnat-like, and her
blue eyes were more prominent than ever.

"Feeling the rheumatics?" he asked, as she helped him off with his
coat. She grinned, silently. He felt friendly; he was glad to
find her much as usual. "And Miss Eleanor?" he asked, as he opened
the drawing-room door. The room was empty. She was not there.
But she had been there, for there was a book on the table. Nothing
had been changed he was glad to see. He stood in front of the fire
and looked at his mother's picture. In the course of the past few
years it had ceased to be his mother; it had become a work of art.
But it was dirty.

There used to be a flower in the grass, he thought, peering into a
dark corner: but now there was nothing but dirty brown paint. And
what's she been reading? he wondered. He took the book that was
propped up against the teapot and looked at it. "Renan," he read.
"Why Renan?" he asked himself, beginning to read as he waited.



"Mr Martin, Miss," said Crosby, opening the study door. Eleanor
looked round. She was standing by her father's chair with her
hands full of long strips of newspaper cuttings, as if she had been
reading them aloud. There was a chess-board in front of him; the
chess-men were set out for a game; but he was lying back in his
chair. He looked lethargic, and rather gloomy.

"Put 'em away. . . . Keep 'em safe somewhere," he said, jerking
his thumb at the cuttings. That was a sign that he had grown very
old, Eleanor thought - wanting newspaper cuttings kept. He had
grown inert and ponderous after his stroke; there were red veins in
his nose and in his cheeks. She too felt old, heavy and dull.

"Mr Martin's called," Crosby repeated.

"Martin's come," Eleanor said. Her father seemed not to hear. He
sat still with his head sunk on his breast. "Martin," Eleanor
repeated. "Martin . . ."

Did he want to see him or did he not want to see him? She waited
as if for some sluggish thought to rise. At last he gave a little
grunt; but what it meant she was not certain.

"I'll send him in after tea," she said. She paused for a moment.
He roused himself and began fumbling with his chess-men. He still
had courage, she observed with pride. He still insisted upon doing
things for himself.



She went into the drawing-room and found Martin standing in front
of the placid, smiling picture of their mother. He held a book in
his hand.

"Why Renan?" he said as she came in. He shut the book and kissed
her. "Why Renan?" he repeated. She flushed slightly. It made her
shy, for some reason, that he had found the book there, open. She
sat down and laid the press cuttings on the tea-table.

"How's Papa?" he asked. She had lost something of her bright
colour, he thought, glancing at her, and her hair had a tuft of
grey in it.

"Rather gloomy," she said, glancing at the press cuttings.

"I wonder," she added, "who writes that sort of thing?"

"What sort of thing?" said Martin. He picked up one of the
crinkled strips and began reading it: "'. . . an exceptionally
able public servant . . . a man of wide interests. . . .' Oh,
Digby," he said. "Obituaries. I passed the house this afternoon,"
he added. "It's sold."

"Already?" said Eleanor.

"It looked very shut-up and desolate," he added. "There was a
dirty old woman in the basement."

Eleanor took out a hair-pin and began fraying the wick of the
kettle. Martin watched her for a moment in silence.

"I liked going there," he said at length. "I liked Eugénie," he
added.

Eleanor paused.

"Yes . . ." she said doubtfully. She had never felt at her ease
with her. "She exaggerated," she added.

"Well of course," Martin laughed. He smiled, recalling some
memory. "She had less sense of truth than . . . that's no sort of
use, Nell," he broke off, irritated by her fumbling with the wick.

"Yes, yes," she protested. "It boils in time."

She paused. Stretching out towards the tea-caddy, she measured the
tea. "One, two, three, four," she counted.

She still used the nice old silver tea-caddy, he noticed, with the
sliding lid. He watched her measuring the tea methodically - one,
two, three, four. He was silent.

"We can't  tell a lie to save our souls," he said abruptly.

What makes him say that? Eleanor wondered.

"When I was with them in Italy - ," she said aloud. But here the
door opened and Crosby came in carrying some sort of dish. She
left the door ajar and a dog pushed in after her.

"I mean - " Eleanor added; but she could not say what she meant with
Crosby in the room fidgeting about.

"It's time Miss Eleanor got a new kettle," said Martin, pointing to
the old brass kettle, faintly engraved with a design of roses,
which he had always hated.

"Crosby," said Eleanor, still poking with her pin, "doesn't  hold
with new inventions. Crosby won't  trust herself in the Tube, will
you, Crosby?"

Crosby grinned. They always spoke to her in the third person,
because she never answered but only grinned. The dog snuffed at
the dish she had just put down. "Crosby's letting that beast get
much too fat," said Martin, pointing at the dog.

"That's what I'm always telling her," said Eleanor.

"If I were you, Crosby," said Martin, "I'd cut down his meals and
take him for a brisk run round the park every morning." Crosby
opened her mouth wide.

"Oh, Mr Martin!" she protested, shocked by his brutality into
speech.

The dog followed her out of the room.

"Crosby's the same as ever," said Martin.

Eleanor had lifted the lid of the kettle and was looking in. There
were no bubbles on the water yet.

"Damn that kettle," said Martin. He took up one of the newspaper
cuttings and began to make it into a spill.

"No, no, Papa wants them kept," said Eleanor. "But he wasn't  like
that," she said, laying her hand on the newspaper cuttings. "Not
in the least."

"What was he like?" Martin asked.

Eleanor paused. She could see her uncle clearly in her mind's eye;
he held his top-hat in his hand; he laid his hand on her shoulder
as they stopped in front of some picture. But how could she
describe him?

"He used to take me to the National Gallery," she said.

"Very cultivated, of course," said Martin. "But he was such a
damned snob."

"Only on the surface," said Eleanor.

"And always finding fault with Eugénie about little things," Martin
added.

"But think of living with her," said Eleanor.

"That manner - " She threw her hand out; but not as Eugénie threw
her hand out, Martin thought.

"I liked her," he said. "I liked going there." He saw the untidy
room; the piano open; the window open; a wind blowing the curtains,
and his aunt coming forward with her arms open. "What a pleasure,
Martin! what a pleasure!" she would say. What had her private life
been, he wondered - her love affairs? She must have had them - 
obviously, obviously.

"Wasn't  there some story," he began, "about a letter?" He wanted
to say, Didn't  she have an affair with somebody? But it was more
difficult to be open with his sister than with other women, because
she treated him as if he were a small boy still. Had Eleanor ever
been in love, he wondered, looking at her.

"Yes," she said. "There was a story - "

But here the electric bell rang sharply. She stopped.

"Papa," she said. She half rose.

"No," said Martin. "I'll go." He got up. "I promised him a game
of chess."

"Thanks, Martin. He'll enjoy that," said Eleanor with relief as he
left the room, and she found herself alone.



She leant back in her chair. How terrible old age was, she
thought; shearing off all one's faculties, one by one, but leaving
something alive in the centre: leaving - she swept up the press
cuttings - a game of chess, a drive in the park, and a visit from
old General Arbuthnot in the evening.

It was better to die, like Eugénie and Digby, in the prime of life
with all one's faculties about one. But he wasn't  like that, she
thought, glancing at the press cuttings. "A man of singularly
handsome presence . . . shot, fished, and played golf." No, not
like that in the least. He had been a curious man; weak;
sensitive; liking titles; liking pictures; and often depressed, she
guessed, by his wife's exuberance. She pushed the cuttings away
and took up her book. It was odd how different the same person
seemed to two different people, she thought. There was Martin,
liking Eugénie; and she, liking Digby. She began to read.

She had always wanted to know about Christianity - how it began;
what it meant, originally. God is love, The kingdom of Heaven is
within us, sayings like that she thought, turning over the pages,
what did they mean? The actual words were very beautiful. But who
said them - when? Then the spout of the tea-kettle puffed steam at
her and she moved it away. The wind was rattling the windows in
the back room; it was bending the little bushes; they still had no
leaves on them. It was what a man said under a fig tree, on a
hill, she thought. And then another man wrote it down. But
suppose that what that man says is just as false as what this man - 
she touched the press cuttings with her spoon - says about Digby?
And here am I, she thought, looking at the china in the Dutch
cabinet, in this drawing-room, getting a little spark from what
someone said all those years ago - here it comes  the china was
changing from blue to livid  skipping over all those mountains, all
those seas. She found her place and began to read.

But a sound in the hall interrupted her. Was someone coming in?
She listened. No, it was the wind. The wind was terrific. It
pressed on the house; gripped it tight, then let it fall apart.
Upstairs a door slammed; a window must be open in the bedroom
above. A blind was tapping. It was difficult to fix her mind on
Renan. She liked it, though. French she could read easily of
course; and Italian; and a little German. But what vast gaps there
were, what blank spaces, she thought leaning back in her chair, in
her knowledge! How little she knew about anything. Take this cup
for instance; she held it out in front of her. What was it made
of? Atoms? And what were atoms, and how did they stick together?
The smooth hard surface of the china with its red flowers seemed to
her for a second a marvellous mystery. But there was another sound
in the hall. It was the wind, but it was also a voice, talking.
It must be Martin. But who could he be talking to, she wondered?
She listened, but she could not hear what he was saying because of
the wind. And why, she asked herself, did he say We can't  tell a
lie to save our souls? He was thinking about himself; one always
knew when people were thinking about themselves by their tone of
voice. Perhaps he was justifying himself for having left the Army.
That had been courageous, she thought; but isn't  it odd, she mused,
listening to the voices, that he should be such a dandy too? He
was wearing a new blue suit with white stripes on it. And he had
shaved off his moustache. He ought never to have been a soldier,
she thought; he was much too pugnacious. . . . They were still
talking. She could not hear what he was saying, but from the sound
of his voice it came over her that he must have a great many love
affairs. Yes - it became perfectly obvious to her, listening to his
voice through the door, that he had a great many love affairs. But
who with? and why do men think love affairs so important? she asked
as the door opened.



"Hullo, Rose!" she exclaimed, surprised to see her sister come in
too. "I thought you were in Northumberland!"

"You thought I was in Northumberland!" Rose laughed, kissing her.
"But why? I said the eighteenth."

"But isn't  today the eleventh?" said Eleanor.

"You're only a week behind the times, Nell," said Martin.

"Then I must have dated all my letters wrong!" Eleanor exclaimed.
She glanced apprehensively at her writing-table. The walrus, with
a worn patch in its bristles, no longer stood there.

"Tea, Rose?" she asked.

"No. It's a bath I want," said Rose. She threw off her hat and
ran her fingers through her hair.

"You're looking very well," said Eleanor, thinking how handsome she
looked. But she had a scratch on her chin.

"A positive beauty, isn't  she?" Martin laughed at her.

Rose threw her head up rather like a horse. They always bickered,
Eleanor thought - Martin and Rose. Rose was handsome, but she
wished she dressed better. She was dressed in a green hairy coat
and skirt with leather buttons, and she carried a shiny bag. She
had been holding meetings in the North.

"I want a bath," Rose repeated. "I'm dirty. And what's all this?"
she said, pointing to the press cuttings on the table. "Oh, Uncle
Digby," she added casually, pushing them away. He had been dead
some months now; they were already yellowish and curled.

"Martin says the house has been sold," said Eleanor.

"Has it?" she said indifferently. She broke off a piece of cake
and began munching it. "Spoiling my dinner," she said. "But I had
no time for lunch."

"What a woman of action she is!" Martin chaffed her.

"And the meetings?" Eleanor asked.

"Yes. What about the North?" said Martin.

They began to discuss politics. She had been speaking at a by-
election. A stone had been thrown at her; she put her hand to her
chin. But she had enjoyed it.

"I think we gave 'em something to think about," she said, breaking
off another piece of cake.

She ought to have been the soldier, Eleanor thought. She was
exactly like the picture of old Uncle Pargiter of Pargiter's Horse.
Martin, now that he had shaved his moustache off and showed his
lips, ought to have been - what? Perhaps an architect, she thought.
He's so - she looked up. Now it was hailing. White rods came
across the window in the back room. There was a great gust of
wind; the little bushes blanched and bent under it. And a window
banged upstairs in her mother's bedroom. Perhaps I ought to go and
shut it, she thought. The rain must be coming in.

"Eleanor - 'said Rose. "Eleanor" - she repeated.

Eleanor started.

"Eleanor's broody," said Martin.

"No, not at all - not at all," she protested. "What are you talking
about?"

"I was asking you," said Rose. "Do you remember that row when the
microscope was broken? Well, I met that boy - that horrid, ferret-
faced boy - Erridge - up in the North."

"He wasn't  horrid," said Martin.

"He was," Rose persisted. "A horrid little sneak. He pretended
that it was I who broke the microscope and it was he who broke
it. . . . D'you remember that row?" She turned to Eleanor.

"I don't  remember that row," said Eleanor. "There were so many,"
she added.

"That was one of the worst," said Martin.

"It was," said Rose. She pursed her lips together. Some memory
seemed to have come back to her. "And after it was over," she
said, turning to Martin, "you came up into the nursery and asked me
to go beetling with you in the Round Pond. D'you remember?"

She paused. There was something queer about the memory, Eleanor
could see. She spoke with a curious intensity.

"And you said, 'I'll ask you three times; and if you don't  answer
the third time, I'll go alone.' And I swore, 'I'll let him go
alone.'" Her blue eyes blazed.

"I can see you," said Martin. "Wearing a pink frock, with a knife
in your hand."

"And you went," Rose said; she spoke with suppressed vehemence.
"And I dashed into the bathroom and cut this gash" - she held out
her wrist. Eleanor looked at it. There was a thin white scar just
above the wrist joint.

When did she do that? Eleanor thought. She could not remember.
Rose had locked herself into the bathroom with a knife and cut her
wrist. She had known nothing about it. She looked at the white
mark. It must have bled.

"Oh, Rose always was a firebrand!" said Martin. He got up. "She
always had the devil's own temper," he added. He stood for a
moment looking round the drawing-room, cluttered up with several
hideous pieces of furniture that he would have got rid of had be
been Eleanor, he thought, and forced to live there. But perhaps
she did not mind things like that.

"Dining out?" she said. He dined out every night. She would like
to have asked him where he was dining.

He nodded without saying anything. He met all sorts of people she
did not know, she reflected; and he did not want to talk about
them. He had turned to the fireplace.

"That picture wants cleaning," he said, pointing to the picture of
their mother.

"It's a nice picture," he added, looking at it critically. "But
usen't  there to be a flower in the grass?"

Eleanor looked at it. She had not looked at it, so as to see it,
for many years.

"Was there?" she said.

"Yes. A little blue flower," said Martin. "I can remember it when
I was a child. . . ."

He turned. Some memory from his childhood came over him as he saw
Rose sitting there at the tea table with her fist still clenched.
He saw her standing with her back to the school-room door; very red
in the face, with her lips tight shut as they were now. She had
wanted him to do something. And he had crumpled a ball of paper in
his hand and shied it at her.

"What awful lives children live!" he said, waving his hand at her
as he crossed the room. "Don't  they, Rose?"

"Yes," said Rose. "And they can't  tell anybody," she added.

There was another gust and the sound of glass crashing.

"Miss Pym's conservatory?" said Martin, pausing with his hand on
the door.

"Miss Pym?" said Eleanor. "She's been dead these twenty years!"



1910


In the country it was an ordinary day enough; one of the long reel
of days that turned as the years passed from green to orange; from
grass to harvest. It was neither hot nor cold, an English spring
day, bright enough, but a purple cloud behind the hill might mean
rain. The grasses rippled with shadow, and then with sunlight.

In London, however, the stricture and pressure of the season were
already felt, especially in the West End, where flags flew; canes
tapped; dresses flowed; and houses freshly painted had awnings
spread and swinging baskets of red geraniums. The Parks too - St.
James's, the Green Park, Hyde Park - were making ready. Already in
the morning before there was a chance of a procession, the green
chairs were ranged among the plump brown flower beds with their
curled hyacinths, as if waiting for something to happen; for a
curtain to rise; for Queen Alexandra to come, bowing through the
gates. She had a face like a flower petal, and always wore her
pink carnation.

Men lay flat on the grass reading newspapers with their shirts
open; on the bald scrubbed space by the Marble Arch speakers
congregated; nursemaids vacantly regarded them; and mothers,
squatted on the grass, watched their children play. Down Park Lane
and Piccadilly vans, cars, omnibuses ran along the streets as if
the streets were slots; stopped and jerked; as if a puzzle were
solved, and then broken, for it was the season, and the streets
were crowded. Over Park Lane and Piccadilly the clouds kept their
freedom, wandering fitfully, staining windows gold, daubing them
black, passed and vanished, though marble in Italy looked no more
solid, gleaming in the quarries, veined with yellow, than the
clouds over Park Lane.



If the bus stopped here, Rose thought, looking down over the side,
she would get up. The bus stopped, and she rose. It was a pity,
she thought, as she stepped onto the pavement and caught a glimpse
of her own figure in a tailor's window, not to dress better, not to
look nicer. Always reach-me-downs, coats and skirts from
Whiteleys. But they saved time, and the years after all - she was
over forty - made one care very little what people thought. They
used to say, why don't  you marry? Why don't  you do this or that,
interfering. But not any longer.

She paused in one of the little alcoves that were scooped out in
the bridge, from habit. People always stopped to look at the
river. It was running fast, a muddy gold this morning with smooth
breadths and ripples, for the tide was high. And there was the
usual tug and the usual barges with black tarpaulins and corn
showing. The water swirled round the arches. As she stood there,
looking down at the water, some buried feeling began to arrange the
stream into a pattern. The pattern was painful. She remembered
how she had stood there on the night of a certain engagement,
crying; her tears had fallen, her happiness, it seemed to her, had
fallen. Then she had turned - here she turned - and had seen the
churches, the masts and roofs of the city. There's THAT, she had
said to herself. Indeed it was a splendid view. . . . She looked,
and then again she turned. There were the Houses of Parliament. A
queer expression, half frown, half smile, formed on her face and
she threw herself slightly backwards, as if she were leading an
army.

"Damned humbugs!" she said aloud, striking her fist on the
balustrade. A clerk who was passing looked at her with surprise.
She laughed. She often talked aloud. Why not? That too was one
of the consolations, like her coat and skirt, and the hat she stuck
on without giving a look in the glass. If people chose to laugh,
let them. She strode on. She was lunching in Hyams Place with her
cousins. She had asked herself on the spur of the moment, meeting
Maggie in a shop. First she had heard a voice; then seen a hand.
And it was odd, considering how little she knew them - they had
lived abroad - how strongly, sitting there at the counter before
Maggie saw her, simply from the sound of her voice, she had felt - 
she supposed it was affection? - some feeling bred of blood in
common. She had got up and said May I come and see you? busy as
she was, hating to break her day in the middle. She walked on.
They lived in Hyams Place, over the river - Hyams Place, that little
crescent of old houses with the name carved in the middle which she
used to pass so often when she lived down here. She used to ask
herself in those far-off days Who was Hyam? But she had never
solved the question to her satisfaction. She walked on, across the
river.



The shabby street on the south side of the river was very noisy.
Now and again a voice detached itself from the general clamour. A
woman shouted to her neighbour; a child cried. A man trundling a
barrow opened his mouth and bawled up at the windows as he passed.
There were bedsteads, grates, pokers and odd pieces of twisted iron
on his barrow. But whether he was selling old iron or buying old
iron it was impossible to say; the rhythm persisted; but the words
were almost rubbed out.

The swarm of sound, the rush of traffic, the shouts of the hawkers,
the single cries and the general cries, came into the upper room of
the house in Hyams Place where Sara Pargiter sat at the piano. She
was singing. Then she stopped; she watched her sister laying the
table.

"Go search the valleys," she murmured, as she watched her, "pluck
up every rose." She paused. "That's very nice," she added,
dreamily. Maggie had taken a bunch of flowers; had cut the tight
little string which bound them, and had laid them side by side on
the table; and was arranging them in an earthenware pot. They were
differently coloured, blue, white and purple. Sara watched her
arranging them. She laughed suddenly.

"What are you laughing at?" said Maggie absent-mindedly. She added
a purple flower to the bunch and looked at it.

"Dazed in a rapture of contemplation," said Sara, 'shading her eyes
with peacocks' feathers dipped in morning dew - " she pointed to the
table. "Maggie said," she jumped up and pirouetted about the room,
"three's the same as two, three's the same as two." She pointed to
the table upon which three places had been laid.

"But we are three," said Maggie. "Rose is coming." Sara stopped.
Her face fell.

"Rose is coming?" she repeated.

"I told you," said Maggie. "I said to you, Rose is coming to
luncheon on Friday. It is Friday. And Rose is coming to luncheon.
Any minute now," she said. She got up and began to fold some stuff
that was lying on the floor.

"It is Friday, and Rose is coming to luncheon," Sara repeated.

"I told you," said Maggie. "I was in a shop. I was buying stuff.
And somebody" - she paused to make her fold more accurately - "came
out from behind a counter and said, 'I'm your cousin. I'm Rose,'
she said. 'Can I come and see you? Any day, any time,' she said.
So I said," she put the stuff on a chair, "lunch."

She looked round the room to see that everything was in readiness.
Chairs were missing. Sara pulled up a chair.

"Rose is coming," she said, "and this is where she'll sit." She
placed the chair at the table facing the window. "And she'll take
off her gloves; and she'll lay one on this side, one on that. And
she'll say, I've  never been in this part of London before.'"

"And then?" said Maggie, looking at the table.

"You'll say 'It's so convenient for the theatres.'"

"And then?" said Maggie.

"And then she'll say rather wistfully, smiling, putting her head on
one side, 'D'you often go to the theatre, Maggie?'"

"No," said Maggie. "Rose has red hair."

"Red hair?" Sara exclaimed. "I thought it was grey - a little wisp
straggling from under a black bonnet," she added.

"No," said Maggie. "She has a great deal of hair; and it's red."

"Red hair; red Rose," Sara exclaimed. She spun round on her toe.

"Rose of the flaming heart; Rose of the burning breast; Rose of the
weary world - red, red Rose!"

A door slammed below; they heard footsteps mounting the stairs.
"There she is," said Maggie.

The steps stopped. They heard a voice saying, "Still further up?
On the very top? Thank you." Then the steps began mounting the
stairs again.

"This is the worst torture . . ." Sara began, screwing her hands
together and clinging to her sister, "that life. . . ."

"Don't  be such an ass," said Maggie, pushing her away, as the door
opened.



Rose came in.

"It's ages since we met," she said, shaking hands.

She wondered what had made her come. Everything was different from
what she expected. The room was rather poverty-stricken; the
carpet did not cover the floor. There was a sewing-machine in the
corner, and Maggie too looked different from what she had looked in
the shop. But there was a crimson-and-gilt chair; she recognised
it with relief.

"That used to stand in the hall, didn't  it?" she said, putting her
bag down on the chair.

"Yes," said Maggie.

"And that glass - " said Rose, looking at the old Italian glass
blurred with spots that hung between the windows, "wasn't  that
there too?"

"Yes," said Maggie, "in my mother's bedroom."

There was a pause. There seemed to be nothing to say.

"What nice rooms you've  found!" Rose continued, making
conversation. It was a large room and the door-posts had little
carvings on them. "But don't  you find it rather noisy?" she
continued.

The man was crying under the window. She looked out of the window.
Opposite there was a row of slate roofs, like half-opened
umbrellas; and, rising high above them, a great building which,
save for thin black strokes across it, seemed to be made entirely
of glass. It was a factory. The man bawled in the street
underneath.

"Yes, it's noisy," said Maggie. "But very convenient."

"Very convenient for the theatres," said Sara, as she put down the
meat.

"So I remember finding," said Rose, turning to look at her, "when I
lived here myself."

"Did you live here?" said Maggie, beginning to help the cutlets.

"Not here," she said. "Round the corner. With a friend."

"We thought you lived in Abercorn Terrace," said Sara.

"Can't  one live in more places than one?" Rose asked, feeling
vaguely annoyed, for she had lived in many places, felt many
passions, and done many things.

"I remember Abercorn Terrace," said Maggie. She paused. "There
was a long room; and a tree at the end; and a picture over the
fireplace, of a girl with red hair?"

Rose nodded. "Mama when she was young," she said.

"And a round table in the middle?" Maggie continued.

Rose nodded.

"And you had a parlourmaid with very prominent blue eyes?"

"Crosby. She's still with us."

They ate in silence.

"And then?" said Sara, as if she were a child asking for a story.

"And then?" said Rose. "Well then" - she looked at Maggie, thinking
of her as a little girl who had come to tea.

She saw them sitting round a table; and a detail that she had not
thought of for years came back to her - how Milly used to take her
hair-pin and fray the wick of the kettle. And she saw Eleanor
sitting with her account books; and she saw herself go up to her
and say: "Eleanor, I want to go to Lamley's."

Her past seemed to be rising above her present. And for some
reason she wanted to talk about her past; to tell them something
about herself that she had never told anybody - something hidden.
She paused, gazing at the flowers in the middle of the table
without seeing them. There was a blue knot in the yellow glaze she
noticed.

"I remember Uncle Abel," said Maggie. "He gave me a necklace; a
blue necklace with gold spots."

"He's still alive," said Rose.

They talked, she thought, as if Abercorn Terrace were a scene in a
play. They talked as if they were speaking of people who were
real, but not real in the way in which she felt herself to be real.
It puzzled her; it made her feel that she was two different people
at the same time; that she was living at two different times at the
same moment. She was a little girl wearing a pink frock; and here
she was in this room, now. But there was a great rattle under the
windows. A dray went roaring past. The glasses jingled on the
table. She started slightly, roused from her thoughts about her
childhood, and separated the glasses.

"Don't  you find it very noisy here?" she said.

"Yes. But very convenient for the theatres," said Sara.

Rose looked up. She had repeated herself. She thinks me an old
fool, Rose thought, making the same remark twice over. She blushed
slightly.

What is the use, she thought, of trying to tell people about one's
past? What is one's past? She stared at the pot with the blue
knot loosely tied in the yellow glaze. Why did I come, she
thought, when they only laugh at me? Sally rose and cleared away
the plates.

"And Delia - " Maggie began as they waited. She pulled the pot
towards her, and began to arrange the flowers. She was not
listening; she was thinking her own thoughts. She reminded Rose,
as she watched her, of Digby - absorbed in the arrangement of a
bunch of flowers, as if to arrange flowers, to put the white by the
blue, were the most important thing in the world.

"She married an Irishman," she said aloud.

Maggie took a blue flower and placed it beside a white flower.

"And Edward?" she asked.

"Edward . . ." Rose was beginning, when Sally came in with the
pudding.

"Edward!" she exclaimed, catching the word.

"Oh blasted eyes of my deceased wife's sister - withered prop of my
defunct old age . . ." She put down the pudding. "That's Edward,"
she said. "A quotation from a book he gave me. 'My wasted youth - 
my wasted youth' . . ." The voice was Edward's; Rose could hear
him say it. For he had a way of belittling himself, when in fact
he had a very good opinion of himself.

But it was not the whole of Edward. And she would not have him
laughed at; for she was very fond of her brother and very proud of
him.

"There's not much of 'my wasted youth' about Edward now," she said.

"I thought not," said Sara, taking her place opposite.

They were silent. Rose looked at the flower again. Why did I
come? she kept asking herself. Why had she broken up her morning,
and interrupted her day's work, when it was clear to her that they
had not wished to see her?

"Go on, Rose," said Maggie, helping the pudding. "Go on telling us
about the Pargiters."

"About the Pargiters?" said Rose. She saw herself running along
the broad avenue in the lamplight.

"What could be more ordinary?" she said. "A large family, living
in a large house . . ." And yet she felt that she had been herself
very interesting. She paused. Sara looked at her.

"It's not ordinary," she said. "The Pargiters - " She was holding
a fork in her hand, and she drew a line on the table-cloth. "The
Pargiters," she repeated, "going on and on and on" - here her fork
touched a salt-cellar - "until they come to a rock," she said; "and
then Rose" - she looked at her again: Rose drew herself up slightly,
" - Rose claps spurs to her horse, rides straight up to a man in a
gold coat, and says 'Damn your eyes!' Isn't  that Rose, Maggie?"
she said, looking at her sister as if she had been drawing her
picture on the table-cloth.

That is true, Rose thought as she took her pudding. That is
myself. Again she had the odd feeling of being two people at the
same time.

"Well, that's done," said Maggie, pushing away her plate. "Come
and sit in the armchair, Rose," she said.

She went over to the fireplace and pulled out an armchair, which
had springs like hoops, Rose noticed, in the seat.

They were poor, Rose thought, glancing round her. That was why
they had chosen this house to live in - because it was cheap. They
cooked their own food - Sally had gone into the kitchen to make the
coffee. She drew her chair up beside Maggie's.

"You make your own clothes?" she said, pointing to the sewing-
machine in the corner. There was silk folded on it.

"Yes," said Maggie, looking at the sewing-machine.

"For a party?" said Rose. The stuff was silk, green, with blue
rays on it.

"Tomorrow night," said Maggie. She raised her hand with a curious
gesture to her face, as if she wanted to conceal something. She
wants to hide herself from me, Rose thought, as I want to hide
myself from her. She watched her; she had got up, had fetched the
silk and the sewing-machine, and was threading the needle. Her
hands were large and thin and strong, Rose noticed.

"I never could make my own clothes," she said, watching her arrange
the silk smoothly under the needle. She was beginning to feel at
her ease. She took off her hat and threw it on the floor. Maggie
looked at her with approval. She was handsome, in a ravaged way;
more like a man than a woman.

"But then," said Maggie, beginning to turn the handle rather
cautiously, "you did other things." She spoke in the absorbed
tones of someone who is using their hands.

The machine made a comfortable whirring sound as the needle pricked
through the silk.

"Yes, I did other things," said Rose, stroking the cat that had
stretched itself against her knee, "when I lived down here."

"But that was years ago," she added, "when I was young. I lived
here with a friend," she sighed, "and taught little thieves."

Maggie said nothing; she was whirring the machine round and round.

"I always liked thieves better than other people," Rose added after
a time.

"Yes," said Maggie.

"I never liked being at home," said Rose. "I liked being on my own
much better."

"Yes," said Maggie.

Rose went on talking.

It was quite easy to talk, she found; quite easy. And there was no
need to say anything clever; or to talk about one's self. She was
talking about the Waterloo Road as she remembered it when Sara came
in with the coffee.

"What was that about clinging to a fat man in the Campagna?" she
asked, setting her tray down.

"The Campagna?" said Rose. "There was nothing about the Campagna."

"Heard through a door," said Sara, pouring out the coffee, "talk
sounds very odd." She gave Rose her cup.

"I thought you were talking about Italy; about the Campagna, about
the moonlight."

Rose shook her head. "We were talking about the Waterloo Road,"
she said. But what had she been talking about? Not simply about
the Waterloo Road. Perhaps she had been talking nonsense. She had
been saying the first thing that came into her head.

"All talk would be nonsense, I suppose, if it were written down,"
she said, stirring her coffee.

Maggie stopped the machine for a moment and smiled.

"And even if it isn't ," she said.

"But it's the only way we have of knowing each other," Rose
protested. She looked at her watch. It was later than she
thought. She got up.

"I must go," she said. "But why don't  you come with me?" she added
on the spur of the moment.

Maggie looked up at her. "Where?" she said.

Rose was silent. "To a meeting," she said at length. She
wanted to conceal the thing that interested her most; she felt
extraordinarily shy. And yet she wanted them to come. But why?
she asked herself, as she stood there awkwardly waiting. There was
a pause.

"You could wait upstairs," she said suddenly. "And you'd see
Eleanor; you'd see Martin - the Pargiters in the flesh," she added.
She remembered Sara's phrase, "the caravan crossing the desert,"
she said.

She looked at Sara. She was balancing herself on the arm of a
chair, sipping her coffee and swinging her foot up and down.

"Shall I come?" she asked, vaguely, still swinging her foot up and
down.

Rose shrugged her shoulders. "If you like," she said.

"But should I like it?" Sara continued, still swinging her foot.
". . . this meeting? What do you think, Maggie?" she said,
appealing to her sister. "Shall I go, or shan't  I? Shall I go, or
shan't  I?" Maggie said nothing.

Then Sara got up, went to the window and stood there for a moment
humming a tune. "Go search the valleys; pluck up every rose," she
hummed. The man was passing; he was crying "Any old iron? Any old
iron?" She turned round with a sudden jerk.

"I'll come," she said, as if she had made up her mind. "I'll fling
on my clothes and come."

She sprang up and went into the bedroom. She's like one of those
birds at the Zoo, Rose thought, that never flies but hops rapidly
across the grass.

She turned to the window. It was a depressing little street, she
thought. There was a public house at the corner. The houses
opposite looked very dingy, and it was very noisy. "Any old iron
to sell?" the man was crying under the window, "any old iron?"
Children were screaming in the road; they were playing a game with
chalk-marks on the pavement. She stood there looking down on them.

"Poor little wretches!" she said. She picked up her hat and ran
two bonnet-pins sharply through it. "Don't  you find it rather
unpleasant," she said, giving her hat a little pat on one side as
she looked in the looking-glass, "coming home late at night
sometimes with that public house at the corner?"

"Drunken men, you mean?" said Maggie.

"Yes," said Rose. She buttoned the row of leather buttons on her
tailor-made suit and gave herself a little pat here and there, as
if she were making ready.

"And now what are you talking about?" said Sara, coming in carrying
her shoes. "Another visit to Italy?"

"No," said Maggie. She spoke indistinctly because her mouth was
full of pins. "Drunken men following one."

"Drunken men following one," said Sara. She sat down and began to
put on her shoes.

"But they don't  follow me," she said. Rose smiled. That was
obvious. She was sallow, angular and plain. "I can walk over
Waterloo Bridge at any hour of the day or night," she continued,
tugging at her shoelaces, "and nobody notices." The shoe-lace was
in a knot; she fumbled with it. "But I can remember," she
continued, "being told by a woman - a very beautiful woman - she was
like - "

"Hurry up," Maggie interrupted. "Rose is waiting."

". . . Rose is waiting - well, the woman told me, when she went into
Regent's Park to have an ice" - she stood up, trying to fit her shoe
on to her foot, " - to have an ice, at one of those little tables
under the trees, one of those little round tables laid with a cloth
under the trees" - she hopped about with one shoe off and one shoe
on - "the eyes, she said, came through every leaf like the darts of
the sun; and her ice was melted. . . . Her ice was melted!" she
repeated, tapping her sister on the shoulder as she twirled round
on her toe.

Rose held out her hand. "You're going to stay and finish your
dress?" she said. "You won't  come with us?" It was Maggie she
wanted to come.

"No, I won't  come," said Maggie, shaking hands. "I should hate
it," she added, smiling at Rose with a candour that was baffling.

Did she mean me? thought Rose as she went down the stairs. Did she
mean that she hated me? When I liked her so much?



In the alley that led into the old square off Holborn an elderly
man, battered and red-nosed, as if he had weathered out many years
at street corners, was selling violets. He had his pitch by a row
of posts. The bunches, tightly laced, each with a green frill of
leaves round the rather withered flowers, lay in a row on the tray;
for he had not sold many.

"Nice vilets, fresh vilets," he repeated automatically as the
people passed. Most of them went by without looking. But he went
on repeating his formula automatically. "Nice vilets, fresh
vilets," as if he scarcely expected any one to buy. Then two
ladies came; and he held out his violets, and he said once more
"Nice vilets, fresh vilets." One of them slapped down two coppers
on his tray; and he looked up. The other lady stopped, put her
hand on the post, and said, "Here I leave you." Upon which the one
who was short and stout, struck her on the shoulder and said,
"Don't  be such an ass!" And the tall lady gave a sudden cackle of
laughter, took a bunch of violets from the tray as if she had paid
for it; and off they walked. She's an odd customer, he thought - 
she took the violets though she hadn't  paid for them. He watched
them walking round the square; then he began muttering again, "Nice
vilets, sweet vilets."



"Is this the place where you meet?" said Sara as they walked along
the square.

It was very quiet. The noise of the traffic had ceased. The trees
were not in full leaf yet, and pigeons were shuffling and crooning
on the tree tops. Little bits of twig fell on the pavement as the
birds fidgeted among the branches. A soft air puffed in their
faces. They walked on round the square.

"That's the house over there," said Rose, pointing. She stopped
when she reached a house with a carved doorway, and many names on
the door-post. The windows on the ground floor were open; the
curtains blew in and out, and through them they could see a row of
heads, as if people were sitting round a table, talking.

Rose paused on the door-step.

"Are you coming in," she said, "or aren't  you?"

Sara hesitated. She peered in. Then she brandished her bunch of
violets in Rose's face and cried out, "All right!" she cried.
"Ride on!"



Miriam Parrish was reading a letter. Eleanor was blackening the
strokes on her blotting-paper. I've  heard all this, I've  done all
this so often, she was thinking. She glanced round the table.
People's faces even seemed to repeat themselves. There's the Judd
type there's the Lazenby type, and there's Miriam, she thought,
drawing on her blotting-paper. I know what he's going to say, I
know what she's going to say, she thought, digging a little hole in
the blotting-paper. Here Rose came in. But who's that with her,
Eleanor asked? She did not recognise her. Whoever it was was
waved by Rose to a seat in the corner, and the meeting went on.
Why must we do it? Eleanor thought, drawing a spoke from the hole
in the middle. She looked up. Someone was rattling a stick along
the railings and whistling; the branches of a tree swung up and
down in the garden outside. The leaves were already unfolding. . . .
Miriam put down her papers; Mr Spicer rose.

There's no other way, I suppose, she thought, taking up her pencil
again. She made a note as Mr Spicer spoke. She found that her
pencil could take notes quite accurately while she herself thought
of something else. She seemed able to divide herself into two.
One person followed the argument - and he's putting it very well,
she thought; while the other, for it was a fine afternoon, and she
had wanted to go to Kew, walked down a green glade and stopped in
front of a flowering tree. Is it a magnolia? she asked herself, or
are they already over? Magnolias, she remembered, have no leaves,
but masses of white blossom. . . . She drew a line on the
blotting-paper.

Now Pickford . . . she said, looking up again. Mr Pickford spoke.
She drew more spokes; blackened them. Then she looked up, for
there was a change in the tone of voice.

"I know Westminster very well," Miss Ashford was saying.

"So do I!" said Mr Pickford. "I've  lived there for forty years."

Eleanor was surprised. She had always thought he lived at Ealing.
He lived at Westminster, did he? He was a clean-shaven, dapper
little man, whom she had always seen in her mind's eye running to
catch a train with a newspaper under his arm. But he lived at
Westminster, did he? That was odd, she thought.

Then they went on arguing again. The cooing of the pigeons became
audible. Take two coos, take two coos, tak . . . they were
crooning. Martin was speaking. And he speaks very well, she
thought . . . but he shouldn't  be sarcastic; it puts people's backs
up. She drew another stroke.

Then she heard the rush of a car outside; it stopped outside the
window. Martin stopped speaking. There was a momentary pause.
Then the door opened and in came a tall woman in evening dress.
Everybody looked up.

"Lady Lasswade!" said Mr Pickford, getting up and scraping back his
chair.

"Kitty!" Eleanor exclaimed. She half rose, but she sat down again.
There was a little stir. A chair was found for her. Lady Lasswade
took her place opposite Eleanor.

"I'm so sorry," she apologised, "to be so late. And for coming in
these ridiculous clothes," she added, touching her cloak. She did
look strange, dressed in evening dress in the broad daylight.
There was something shining in her hair.

"The Opera?" said Martin as she sat down beside him.

"Yes," she said briefly. She laid her white gloves in a
businesslike way on the table. Her cloak opened and showed the
gleam of a silver dress beneath. She did look odd compared with
the others; but it's very good of her to come, Eleanor thought,
looking at her, considering she's going on to the Opera. The
meeting began again.

How long has she been married? Eleanor wondered. How long is it
since we broke the swing together at Oxford? She drew another
stroke on the blotting-paper. The dot was now surrounded with
strokes.

". . . and we discussed the whole matter perfectly frankly," Kitty
was saying. Eleanor listened. That's the manner I like, she
thought. She had been meeting Sir Edward at dinner. . . . It's
the great ladies' manner, Eleanor thought . . . authoritative,
natural. She listened again. The great ladies' manner charmed Mr
Pickford; but it irritated Martin, she knew. He was pooh-poohing
Sir Edward and his frankness. Then Mr Spicer was off again; and
Kitty had joined in. Now there was Rose. They were all at
loggerheads. Eleanor listened. She became more and more
irritated. All it comes to is: I'm right and you're wrong, she
thought. This bickering merely wasted time. If we could only get
at something, something deeper, deeper, she thought, prodding her
pencil on the blotting-paper. Suddenly she saw the only point that
was of any importance. She had the words on the tip of her tongue.
She opened her mouth to speak. But just as she cleared her throat,
Mr Pickford swept his papers together and rose. Would they pardon
him? he said. He had to be at the Law Courts. He rose and went.

The meeting dragged on. The ash-tray in the middle of the table
became full of cigarette-stumps; the air became thick with smoke;
then Mr Spicer went; Miss Bodham went; Miss Ashford wound a scarf
tightly round her neck, snapped her attaché-case to, and strode out
of the room. Miriam Parrish took off her pince-nez and fixed them
to a hook that was sewn onto the front of her dress. Everybody was
going; the meeting was over. Eleanor got up. She wanted to speak
to Kitty. But Miriam intercepted her.

"About coming to see you on Wednesday," she began.

"Yes," said Eleanor.

"I've  just remembered I've  promised to take a niece to the
dentist," said Miriam.

"Saturday would suit me just as well," said Eleanor.

Miriam paused. She pondered.

"Would Monday do instead?" she said.

"I'll write," said Eleanor with an irritation that she could never
conceal, saint though Miriam was, and Miriam fluttered away with a
guilty air as if she were a little dog caught stealing.



Eleanor turned. The others were still arguing.

"You'll agree with me one of these days," Martin was saying.

"Never! Never!" said Kitty, slapping her gloves on the table. She
looked very handsome; at the same time rather absurd in her evening
dress.

"Why didn't  you speak, Nell?" she said, turning on her.

"Because - " Eleanor began, "I don't  know," she added, rather
feebly. She felt suddenly shabby and dowdy compared with Kitty,
who stood there in full evening dress with something shining in her
hair.

"Well," said Kitty, turning away. "I must be off. But can't  I
give anyone a lift?" she said, pointing to the window. There was
her car.

"What a magnificent car!" said Martin, looking at it, with a sneer
in his voice.

"It's Charlie's," said Kitty rather sharply.

"What about you, Eleanor?" she said, turning to her.

"Thanks," said Eleanor: " - one moment."

She had muddled her things up. She had left her gloves somewhere.
Had she brought an umbrella, or hadn't  she? She felt flustered and
dowdy, as if she were a schoolgirl suddenly. There was the
magnificent car waiting, and the chauffeur held the door open with
a rug in his hand.

"Get in," said Kitty. And she got in and the chauffeur put the rug
over her knees.

"We'll leave them," said Kitty, with a wave of her hand,
"caballing." And the car drove off.



"What a pig-headed set they are!" said Kitty, turning to Eleanor.

"Force is always wrong - don't  you agree with me? - always wrong!"
she repeated, drawing the rug over her knees. She was still under
the influence of the meeting. Yet she wanted to talk to Eleanor.
They met so seldom; she liked her so much. But she was shy,
sitting there in her absurd clothes, and she could not jerk her
mind out of the rut of the meeting in which it was running.

"What a pig-headed set they are!" she repeated. Then she began:

"Tell me. . . ."

There were many things that she wanted to ask; but the engine was
so powerful; the car swept in and out of the traffic so smoothly;
before she had time to say any of the things she wanted to say
Eleanor had put her hand out because they had reached the Tube
station.

"Would he stop here?" she said, rising.

"But must you get out?" Kitty began. She had wanted to talk to
her. "I must, I must," said Eleanor. "Papa's expecting me." She
felt like a child again beside this great lady and the chauffeur,
who was holding the door open.

"Do come and see me - do let us meet again soon, Nell," said Kitty,
taking her hand.



The car started on again. Lady Lasswade sat back in her corner.
She wished she saw more of Eleanor, she thought; but she never
could get her to come and dine. It was always "Papa's expecting
me" or some other excuse, she thought rather bitterly. They had
gone such different ways, they had lived such different lives,
since Oxford. . . . The car slowed down. It had to take its place
in the long line of cars that moved at a foot's pace, now stopping
dead, now jerking on, down the narrow street, blocked by market
carts, that led to the Opera House. Men and women in full evening
dress were walking along the pavement. They looked uncomfortable
and self-conscious as they dodged between costers' barrows, with
their high piled hair and their evening cloaks; with their button-
holes and their white waistcoats, in the glare of the afternoon
sun. The ladies tripped uncomfortably on their high-heeled shoes;
now and then they put their hands to their heads. The gentlemen
kept close beside them as though protecting them. It's absurd,
Kitty thought; it's ridiculous to come out in full evening dress at
this time of day. She leant back in her corner. Covent Garden
porters, dingy little clerks in their ordinary working clothes,
coarse-looking women in aprons stared in at her. The air smelt
strongly of oranges and bananas. But the car was coming to a
standstill. It drew up under the archway; she pushed through the
glass doors and went in.

She felt at once a sense of relief. Now that the daylight was
extinguished and the air glowed yellow and crimson, she no longer
felt absurd. On the contrary, she felt appropriate. The ladies
and gentlemen who were mounting the stairs were dressed exactly as
she was. The smell of oranges and bananas had been replaced by
another smell - a subtle mixture of clothes and gloves and flowers
that affected her pleasantly. The carpet was thick beneath her
feet. She went along the corridor till she came to her own box
with the card on it. She went in and the whole Opera House opened
in front of her. She was not late after all. The orchestra was
still tuning up; the players were laughing, talking and turning
round in their seats as they fiddled busily with their instruments.
She stood looking down at the stalls. The floor of the house was
in a state of great agitation. People were passing to their seats;
they were sitting down and getting up again; they were taking off
their cloaks and signalling to friends. They were like birds
settling on a field. In the boxes white figures were appearing
here and there; white arms rested on the ledges of boxes; white
shirt-fronts shone beside them. The whole house glowed - red, gold,
cream-coloured, and smelt of clothes and flowers, and echoed with
the squeaks and trills of the instruments and with the buzz and hum
of voices. She glanced at the programme that was laid on the ledge
of her box. It was Siegfried - her favourite opera. In a little
space within the highly decorated border the names of the cast were
given. She stooped to read them; then a thought struck her and she
glanced at the royal box. It was empty. As she looked the door
opened and two men came in; one was her cousin Edward; the other a
boy, a cousin of her husband's.

"They haven't  put it off?" he said as he shook hands. "I was
afraid they might." He was something in the Foreign Office; with a
handsome Roman head.

They all looked instinctively at the royal box. Programmes lay
along the edge; but there was no bouquet of pink carnations. The
box was empty.

"The doctors have given him up," said the young man, looking very
important. They all think they know everything, Kitty thought,
smiling at his air of private information.

"But if he dies?" she said, looking at the royal box, "d'you think
they'll stop it?"

The young man shrugged his shoulders. About that he could not be
positive apparently. The house was filling up. Lights winked on
ladies' arms as they turned; ripples of light flashed, stopped, and
then flashed the opposite way as they turned their heads.

But now the conductor pushed his way through the orchestra to his
raised seat. There was an outburst of applause; he turned, bowed
to the audience; turned again, all the lights sank down; the
overture had begun.

Kitty leant back against the wall of the box; her face was shaded
by the folds of the curtain. She was glad to be shaded. As they
played the overture she looked at Edward. She could only see the
outline of his face in the red glow; it was heavier than it used to
be; but he looked intellectual, handsome and a little remote as he
listened to the overture. It wouldn't  have done, she thought; I'm
much too . . . she did not finish the sentence. He has never
married, she thought; and she had. And I've  three boys. I've  been
in Australia, I've  been in India. . . . The music made her think
of herself and her own life as she seldom did. It exalted her; it
cast a flattering light over herself, her past. But why did Martin
laugh at me for having a car? she thought. What's the good of
laughing? she asked.

Here the curtain went up. She leant forward and looked at the
stage. The dwarf was hammering at the sword. Hammer, hammer,
hammer, he went with little short, sharp strokes. She listened.
The music had changed. HE, she thought, looking at the handsome
boy, knows exactly what the music means. He was already completely
possessed by the music. She liked the look of complete absorption
that had swum up on top of his immaculate respectability, making
him seem almost stern. . . . But here was Siegfried. She leant
forward. Dressed in leopard-skins, very fat, with nut-brown
thighs, leading a bear - here he was. She liked the fat bouncing
young man in his flaxen wig: his voice was magnificent. Hammer,
hammer, hammer he went. She leant back again. What did that make
her think of? A young man who came into a room with shavings in
his hair . . . when she was very young. In Oxford? She had gone
to tea with them; had sat on a hard chair; in a very light room;
and there was a sound of hammering in the garden. And then a boy
came in with shavings in his hair. And she had wanted him to kiss
her. Or was it the farm hand up at Carter's, when old Carter had
loomed up suddenly leading a bull with a ring through its nose?

"That's the sort of life I like," she thought, taking up her opera-
glasses. "That's the sort of person I am. . . ." she finished her
sentence.

Then she put the opera-glasses to her eyes. The scenery suddenly
became bright and close; the grass seemed to be made of thick green
wool; she could see Siegfried's fat brown arms glistening with
paint. His face was shiny. She put down the glasses and leant
back in her corner.

And old Lucy Craddock - she saw Lucy sitting at a table; with her
red nose, and her patient, kind eyes. "So you've  done no work this
week again, Kitty!" she said reproachfully. How I loved her! Kitty
thought. And then she had gone back to the Lodge; and there was
the tree, with a prop in the middle; and her mother sitting bolt
upright. . . . I wish I hadn't  quarrelled so much with my mother,
she thought, overcome with a sudden sense of the passage of time
and its tragedy. Then the music changed.

She looked at the stage again. The Wanderer had come in. He was
sitting on a bank in a long grey dressing-gown; and a patch wobbled
uncomfortably over one of his eyes. On and on he went; on and on.
Her attention flagged. She glanced round the dim red house; she
could only see white elbows pointed on the ledges of boxes; here
and there a sharp pinpoint of light showed as some one followed the
score with a torch. Edward's fine profile again caught her eye.
He was listening, critically, intently. It wouldn't  have done, she
thought, it wouldn't  have done at all.

At last the Wanderer had gone. And now? she asked herself, leaning
forward. Siegfried burst in. Dressed in his leopard-skins,
laughing and singing, here he was again. The music excited her.
It was magnificent. Siegfried took the broken pieces of the sword
and blew on the fire and hammered, hammered, hammered. The
singing, the hammering and the fire leaping all went on at the same
time. Quicker and quicker, more and more rhythmically, more and
more triumphantly he hammered, until at last up he swung the sword
high above his head and brought it down - crack! The anvil burst
asunder. And then he brandished the sword over his head and
shouted and sang; and the music rushed higher and higher; and the
curtain fell.

The lights opened in the middle of the house. All the colour came
back. The whole Opera House leapt into life again with its faces
and its diamonds and its men and women. They were clapping and
waving their programmes. The whole house seemed to be fluttering
with white squares of paper. The curtains fell apart and were held
back by tall footmen in knee-breeches. Kitty stood up and clapped.
Again the curtains closed; again they parted. The footmen were
almost pulled off their feet by the heavy folds that they had to
hold back. Again and again they held the curtain back; and even
when they had let it fall and the singers had disappeared and the
orchestra were leaving their seats, the audience still stood
clapping and waving their programmes.

Kitty turned to the young man in her box. He was leaning over the
ledge. He was still clapping. He was shouting "Bravo! Bravo!"
He had forgotten her. He had forgotten himself.

"Wasn't  that marvellous?" he said at last, turning round.

There was an odd look on his face as if he were in two worlds at
once and had to draw them together.

"Marvellous!" she agreed. She looked at him with a pang of envy.

"And now," she said, gathering her things together, "let us have
dinner."



At Hyams Place they had finished dinner. The table was cleared;
only a few crumbs remained, and the pot of flowers stood in the
middle of the table like a sentry. The only sound in the room was
the stitching of a needle, pricking through silk, for Maggie was
sewing. Sara sat hunched on the music stool, but she was not
playing.

"Sing something," said Maggie suddenly. Sara turned and struck the
notes.

"Brandishing, flourishing my sword in my hand. . ." she sang. The
words were the words of some pompous eighteenth century march, but
her voice was reedy and thin. Her voice broke. She stopped
singing.

She sat silent with her hands on the notes. "What's the good of
singing if one hasn't  any voice?" she murmured. Maggie went on
sewing.

"What did you do today?" she said at length, looking up abruptly.

"Went out with Rose," said Sara.

"And what did you do with Rose?" said Maggie. She spoke absent-
mindedly. Sara turned and glanced at her. Then she began to play
again. "Stood on the bridge and looked into the water," she
murmured.

"Stood on the bridge and looked into the water," she hummed, in
time to the music. "Running water; flowing water. May my bones
turn to coral; and fish light their lanthorns; fish light their
green lanthorns in my eyes." She half turned and looked round at
Maggie. But she was not attending. Sara was silent. She looked
at the notes again. But she did not see the notes, she saw a
garden; flowers; and her sister; and a young man with a big nose
who stooped to pick a flower that was gleaming in the dark. And he
held the flower out in his hand in the moonlight . . . Maggie
interrupted her.

"You went out with Rose," she said. "Where to?"

Sara left the piano and stood in front of the fireplace.

"We got into a bus and went to Holborn," she said. "And we walked
along a street," she went on; "and suddenly," she jerked her hand
out, "I felt a clap on my shoulder." "Damned liar!" said Rose,
"and took me and flung me against a public house wall!"

Maggie stitched on in silence.

"You got into a bus and went to Holborn," she repeated mechanically
after a time. "And then?"

"Then we went in to a room," Sara continued, "and there were
people - multitudes of people. And I said to myself . . ." she
paused.

"A meeting?" Maggie murmured. "Where?"

"In a room," Sara answered. "A pale greenish light. A woman
hanging clothes on a line in the back garden; and someone went by
rattling a stick on the railings."

"I see," said Maggie. She stitched on quickly.

"I said to myself," Sara resumed, "whose heads are those . . ." she
paused.

"A meeting," Maggie interrupted her. "What for? What about?"

"There were pigeons cooing," Sara went on. "Take two coos, Taffy.
Take two coos . . . Tak . . . And then a wing darkened the air,
and in came Kitty clothed in starlight; and sat on a chair."

She paused. Maggie was silent. She went on stitching for a
moment.

"Who came in?" she asked at length.

"Somebody very beautiful; clothed in starlight; with green in her
hair," said Sara. "Whereupon" - here she changed her voice and
imitated the tones in which a middle-class man might be supposed to
welcome a lady of fashion, "up jumps Mr Pickford, and says 'Oh,
Lady Lasswade, won't  you take this chair?'"

She pushed a chair in front of her.

"And then," she went on, flourishing her hands, "Lady Lasswade sits
down; puts her gloves on the table," - she patted a cushion - "like
that."

Maggie looked up over her sewing. She had a general impression of
a room full of people; sticks rattling on the railings; clothes
hanging out to dry, and someone coming in with beetles' wings in
her hair.

"What happened then?" she asked.

"Then withered Rose, spiky Rose, tawny Rose, thorny Rose," Sara
burst out laughing, 'shed a tear."

"No, no," said Maggie. There was something wrong with the story;
something impossible. She looked up. The light of a passing car
slid across the ceiling. It was growing too dark to see. The lamp
from the public-house opposite made a yellow glare in the room; the
ceiling trembled with a watery pattern of fluctuating light. There
was a sound of brawling in the street outside; a scuffling and
trampling as if the police were hauling someone along the street
against his will. Voices jeered and shouted after him.

"Another row?" Maggie murmured, sticking her needle in the stuff.

Sara got up and went to the window. A crowd had gathered outside
the public house. A man was being thrown out. There he came,
staggering. He fell against a lamp-post to which he clung. The
scene was lit up by the glare of the lamp over the public house
door. Sara stood for a moment at the window watching them. Then
she turned; her face in the mixed light looked cadaverous and worn,
as if she were no longer a girl, but an old woman worn out by a
life of childbirth, debauchery and crime. She stood there hunched
up, with her hands clenched together.

"In time to come," she said, looking at her sister, "people,
looking into this room - this cave, this little antre, scooped out
of mud and dung, will hold their fingers to their noses" - she held
her fingers to her nose - "and say 'Pah! They stink!'" She fell
down into a chair.

Maggie looked at her. Curled round, with her hair falling over her
face and her hands screwed together she looked like some great ape,
crouching there in a little cave of mud and dung. "Pah!" Maggie
repeated to herself, "They stink" . . . She drove her needle
through the stuff in a spasm of disgust. It was true, she thought;
they were nasty little creatures, driven by uncontrollable lusts.
The night was full of roaring and cursing; of violence and unrest,
also of beauty and joy. She got up, holding the dress in her
hands. The folds of silk fell down to the floor and she ran her
hand over them.

"That's done. That's finished," she said, laying the dress on the
table. There was nothing more she could do with her hands. She
folded the dress up and put it away. Then the cat, which had been
asleep, rose very slowly, arched its back and stretched itself to
its full length.

"You want your supper, do you?" said Maggie. She went into the
kitchen and came back with a saucer of milk. "There, poor puss,"
she said, putting the saucer down on the floor. She stood watching
the cat lap up its milk, mouthful by mouthful; then it stretched
itself out again with extraordinary grace.

Sara, standing at a little distance, watched her. Then she
imitated her.

"There, poor puss, there, poor puss," she repeated. "As you rock
the cradle, Maggie," she added.

Maggie raised her arms as if to ward off some implacable destiny;
then let them fall. Sara smiled as she watched her; then tears
brimmed, fell and ran slowly down her cheeks. But as she put up
her hand to wipe them there was a sound of knocking; somebody was
hammering on the door of the next house. The hammering stopped.
Then it began again - hammer, hammer, hammer.

They listened.

"Upcher's come home drunk and wants to be let in," said Maggie.
The knocking ceased. Then it began again.

Sara dried her eyes, roughly, energetically.

"Bring up your children on a desert island where the ships only
come when the moon's full!" she exclaimed.

"Or have none?" said Maggie. A window was thrown open. A woman's
voice was heard shrieking abuse at the man. He bawled back in a
thick drunken voice from the doorstep. Then the door slammed.

They listened.

"Now he'll stagger against the wall and be sick," said Maggie.
They could hear heavy footsteps lurching up the stairs in the next
house. Then there was silence.

Maggie crossed the room to shut the window. The great windows of
the factory opposite were all lit up; it looked like a palace of
glass with thin black bars across it. A glaze of yellow light lit
up the lower halves of the houses opposite; the slate roofs shone
blue, for the sky hung down in a heavy canopy of yellow light.
Footsteps tapped on the pavement, for people were still walking in
the street. Far off a voice was crying hoarsely. Maggie leant
out. The night was windy and warm.

"What's he crying?" she said.

The voice came nearer and nearer.

"Death . . . ?" she said.

"Death . . . ?" said Sara. They leant out. But they could not hear
the rest of the sentence. Then a man who was wheeling a barrow
along the street shouted up to them:

"The King's dead!"



1911


The sun was rising. Very slowly it came up over the horizon
shaking out light. But the sky was so vast, so cloudless, that to
fill it with light took time. Very gradually the clouds turned
blue; leaves on forest trees sparkled; down below a flower shone;
eyes of beasts - tigers, monkeys, birds - sparkled. Slowly the world
emerged from darkness. The sea became like the skin of an
innumerable scaled fish, glittering gold. Here in the South of
France the furrowed vineyards caught the light; the little vines
turned purple and yellow; and the sun coming through the slats of
the blinds striped the white walls. Maggie, standing at the
window, looked down on the courtyard, and saw her husband's book
cracked across with shadow from the vine above; and the glass that
stood beside him glowed yellow. Cries of peasants working came
through the open window.

The sun, crossing the Channel, beat vainly on the blanket of thick
sea mist. Light slowly permeated the haze over London; struck on
the statues in Parliament Square, and on the Palace where the flag
flew though the King, borne under a white and blue Union Jack, lay
in the caverns at Frogmore. It was hotter than ever. Horses'
noses hissed as they drank from the troughs; their hoofs made
ridges hard and brittle as plaster on the country roads. Fires
tearing over the moors left charcoal twigs behind them. It was
August, the holiday season. The glass roofs of the great railway
stations were globes incandescent with light. Travellers watched
the hands of the round yellow clocks as they followed porters,
wheeling portmanteaus, with dogs on leashes. In all the stations
trains were ready to bore their way through England; to the North,
to the South, to the West. Now the guard standing with his hand
raised dropped his flag and the tea-urn slid past. Off the trains
swung through the public gardens with asphalt paths; past the
factories; into open country. Men standing on bridges fishing
looked up; horses cantered; women came to doors and shaded their
eyes; the shadow of the smoke floated over the corn, looped down
and caught a tree. And on they passed.



In the station yard at Wittering, Mrs Chinnery's old victoria stood
waiting. The train was late; it was very hot. William the
gardener sat on the box in his buff-coloured coat with the plated
buttons flicking the flies off. The flies were troublesome. They
had gathered in little brown clusters on the horses' ears. He
flicked his whip; the old mare stamped her hoofs; and shook her
ears, for the flies had settled again. It was very hot. The sun
beat down on the station yard, on the carts and flies and traps
waiting for the train. At last the signal dropped; a puff of smoke
blew over the hedge; and in a minute people came streaming out into
the yard, and here was Miss Pargiter carrying her bag in her hand
and a white umbrella. William touched his hat.

"Sorry to be so late," said Eleanor, smiling up at him, for she
knew him; she came every year.

She put her bag on the seat and sat back under the shade of her
white umbrella. The leather of the carriage was hot behind her
back; it was very hot - hotter even than Toledo. They turned into
the High Street; the heat seemed to make everything drowsy and
silent. The broad street was full of traps and carts with the
reins hanging loose and the horses' heads drooping. But after the
din of the foreign market-places how quiet it seemed! Men in
gaiters were leaning against the walls; the shops had their awnings
out; the pavement was barred with shadow. They had parcels to
fetch. At the fishmonger's they stopped; and a damp white parcel
was handed out to them. At the ironmonger's they stopped; and
William came back with a scythe. Then they stopped at the
chemist's; but there they had to wait, because the lotion was not
yet ready.

Eleanor sat back under the shade of her white umbrella. The air
seemed to hum with the heat. The air seemed to smell of soap and
chemicals. How thoroughly people wash in England, she thought,
looking at the yellow soap, the green soap, and the pink soap in
the chemist's window. In Spain she had hardly washed at all; she
had dried herself with a pocket handkerchief standing among the
white dry stones of the Guadalquivir. In Spain it was all parched
and shrivelled. But here - she looked down the High Street - every
shop was full of vegetables; of shining silver fish; of yellow-
clawed, soft-breasted chickens; of buckets, rakes and wheel-
barrows. And how friendly people were!

She noticed how often hats were touched; hands were grasped; people
stopped, talking, in the middle of the road. But now the chemist
came out with a large bottle wrapped in tissue paper. It was
stowed away under the scythe.

"Midges very bad this year, William?" she asked, recognising the
lotion.

"Tarrible bad, miss, tarrible," he said, touching his hat. There
hadn't  been such a drought since the Jubilee she understood him to
say; but his accent, his singsong and Dorsetshire rhythm, made it
difficult to catch what he said. Then he flicked his whip and they
drove on; past the market cross; past the red brick town hall, with
the arches under it; along a street of bow-windowed eighteenth-
century houses, the residences of doctors and solicitors; past the
pond with chains linking white posts together and a horse drinking;
and so out into the country. The road was laid with soft white
dust; the hedges, hung with wreaths of travellers' joy, seemed also
thick with dust. The old horse settled down into his mechanical
jog-trot, and Eleanor lay back under her white umbrella.

Every summer she came to visit Morris at his mother-in-law's house.
Seven times, eight times she had come she counted; but this year it
was different. This year everything was different. Her father was
dead; her house was shut up; she had no attachment at the moment
anywhere. As she jolted through the hot lanes she thought
drowsily, What shall I do now? Live there? she asked herself, as
she passed a very respectable Georgian villa in the middle of a
street. No, not in a village she said to herself; and they jogged
through the village. What about that house then, she said to
herself, looking at a house with a verandah among some trees. But
then she thought, I should turn into a grey-haired lady cutting
flowers with a pair of scissors and tapping at cottage doors. She
did not want to tap at cottage doors. And the clergyman - a
clergyman was wheeling his bicycle up the hill - would come to tea
with her. But she did not want the clergyman to come to tea with
her. How spick and span it all is she thought; for they were
passing through the village. The little gardens were bright with
red and yellow flowers. Then they began to meet village people; a
procession. Some of the women carried parcels; there was a
gleaming silver object on the quilt of a perambulator; and one old
man clasped a hairy-headed coco-nut to his breast. There had been
a F te she supposed; here it was, returning. They drew to the side
of the road as the carriage trotted past, and cast steady curious
looks at the lady sitting under her green and white umbrella. Now
they came to a white gate; trotted briskly down a short avenue; and
drew up with a flourish of the whip in front of two slender
columns; door-scrapers like bristling hedgehogs; and a wide open
hall door.

She waited for a moment in the hall. Her eyes were dimmed after
the glare of the road. Everything seemed pale and frail and
friendly. The rugs were faded; the pictures were faded. Even the
Admiral in his cocked hat over the fireplace wore a curious look of
faded urbanity. In Greece one was always going back two thousand
years. Here it was always the eighteenth century. Like everything
English, she thought, laying down her umbrella on the refectory
table beside the china bowl, with dried rose leaves in it, the past
seemed near, domestic, friendly.



The door opened. "Oh Eleanor!" her sister-in-law exclaimed,
running into the hall in her fly-away summer clothes, "How nice to
see you! How brown you look! Come into the cool!"

She led her into the drawing-room. The drawing-room piano was
strewn with white baby-linen; pink and green fruit glimmered in
glass bottles.

"We're in such a mess," said Celia, sinking onto the sofa. "Lady
St. Austell has only just this minute gone, and the Bishop."

She fanned herself with a sheet of paper.

"But it's been a great success. We had the bazaar in the garden.
They acted." It was a programme with which she was fanning
herself.

"A play?" said Eleanor.

"Yes, a scene from Shakespeare," said Celia. "Midsummer-Night? As
You Like It? I forget which. Miss Green got it up. Happily it
was so fine. Last year it poured. But how my feet are aching!"
The long window opened onto the lawn. Eleanor could see people
dragging tables.

"What an undertaking!" she said.

"It was!" Celia panted. "We had Lady St. Austell and the Bishop,
coco-nut shies and a pig; but I think it all went off very well.
They enjoyed it."

"For the Church?" Eleanor asked.

"Yes. The new steeple," said Celia.

"What a business!" said Eleanor again. She looked out onto the
lawn. The grass was already scorched and yellow; the laurel bushes
looked shrivelled. Tables were standing against the laurel bushes.
Morris passed, dragging a table.

"Was it nice in Spain?" Celia was asking. "Did you see wonderful
things?"

"Oh yes!" Eleanor exclaimed. "I saw . . ." She stopped. She had
seen wonderful things - buildings, mountains, a red city in a plain.
But how could she describe it?

"You must tell me all about it afterwards," said Celia getting up.
"It's time we got ready. But I'm afraid," she said, toiling rather
painfully up the broad staircase, "I must ask you to be careful,
because we're very short of water. The well. . . ." she stopped.
The well, Eleanor remembered, always gave out in a hot summer.
They walked together down the broad passage, past the old yellow
globe which stood under the pleasant eighteenth-century picture of
all the little Chinnerys in long drawers and nankeen trousers
standing round their father and mother in the garden. Celia paused
with her hand on the bedroom door. The sound of doves cooing came
in through the open window.

"We're putting you in the Blue room this time," she said.
Generally Eleanor had the Pink room. She glanced in. "I hope
you've  got everything - " she began.

"Yes, I'm sure I've  got everything," said Eleanor, and Celia left
her.



The maid had already unpacked her things. There they were - laid on
the bed. Eleanor took off her dress, and stood in her white
petticoat washing herself, methodically but carefully, since they
were short of water. The English sun still made her face prickle
all over where the Spanish sun had burnt it. Her neck had been cut
off from her chest as if it had been painted brown, she thought, as
she slipped on her evening dress in front of the looking-glass.
She twisted her thick hair, with the grey strand in it, rapidly
into a coil; hung the jewel, a red blob like congealed raspberry
jam with a gold seed in the centre, round her neck; and gave one
glance at the woman who had been for fifty-five years so familiar
that she no longer saw her - Eleanor Pargiter. That she was getting
old was obvious; there were wrinkles across her forehead; hollows
and creases where the flesh used to be firm.

And what was my good point? she asked herself, running the comb
once more through her hair. My eyes? Her eyes laughed back at her
as she looked at them. My eyes, yes, she thought. Somebody had
once praised her eyes. She made herself open them instead of
screwing them together. Round each eye were several little white
strokes, where she had crinkled them up to avoid the glare on the
Acropolis, at Naples, at Granada and Toledo. But that's over, she
thought, people praising my eyes, and finished her dressing.

She stood for a moment looking at the burnt, dry lawn. The grass
was almost yellow; the elm trees were beginning to turn brown; red-
and-white cows were munching on the far side of the sunk hedge.
But England was disappointing, she thought; it was small; it was
pretty; she felt no affection for her native land - none whatever.
Then she went down, for she wanted if possible to see Morris alone.



But he was not alone. He got up as she came in and introduced her
to a stoutish, white-haired old man in a dinner-jacket.

"You know each other, don't  you?" said Morris.

"Eleanor - Sir William Whatney." He put a little stress humorously
upon the "Sir" which for a moment confused Eleanor.

"We used to know each other," said Sir William, coming forward and
smiling as he took her hand.

She looked at him. Could it be William Whatney - old Dubbin - who
used to come to Abercorn Terrace years ago? It was. She had not
seen him since he went to India.

But are we all like that? she asked herself, looking from the
grisled, crumpled red-and-yellow face of the boy she had known - he
was almost hairless - at her own brother Morris. He looked bald and
thin; but surely he was in the prime of life, as she was herself?
Or had they all suddenly become old fogies like Sir William? Then
her nephew North and her niece Peggy came in with their mother and
they went in to dinner. Old Mrs Chinnery dined upstairs.

How has Dubbin become Sir William Whatney? she wondered, glancing
at him as they ate the fish that had been brought up in the damp
parcel. She had last seen him - in a boat on the river. They had
gone for a picnic; they had supped on an island in the middle of
the river. Maidenhead, was it?

They were talking about the F te. Craster had won the pig; Mrs
Grice had won the silver-plated salver.

"That's what I saw on the perambulator," said Eleanor. "I met the
F te coming back," she explained. She described the procession.
And they talked about the F te.

"Don't  you envy my sister-in-law?" said Celia, turning to Sir
William. "She's just back from a tour in Greece."

"Indeed!" said Sir William. "Which part of Greece?"

"We went to Athens, then to Olympia, then to Delphi," Eleanor
began, reciting the usual formula. They were on purely formal
terms evidently - she and Dubbin.

"My brother-in-law, Edward," Celia explained, "takes these
delightful tours."

"You remember Edward?" said Morris. "Weren't  you up with him?"

"No, he was junior to me," said Sir William. "But I've  heard of
him, of course. He's - let me think - what is he - a great swell,
isn't  he?"

"Oh, he's at the top of his tree," said Morris.

He was not jealous of Edward, Eleanor thought; but there was a
certain note in his voice which told her that he was comparing his
career with Edward's.

"They loved him," she said. She smiled; she saw Edward lecturing
troops of devout school mistresses on the Acropolis. Out came
their notebooks and down they scribbled every word he said. But he
had been very generous; very kind; he had looked after her all the
time.

"Did you meet anyone at the Embassy?" Sir William asked her. Then
he corrected himself. "Not an Embassy though, is it?"

"No. Athens is not an Embassy," said Morris. Here there was a
diversion; what was the difference between an Embassy and a
Legation? Then they began to discuss the situation in the Balkans.

"There's going to be trouble there in the near future," Sir William
was saying. He turned to Morris; they discussed the situation in
the Balkans.

Eleanor's attention wandered. What's he done? she wondered.
Certain words and gestures brought him back to her as he had been
thirty years ago. There were relics of the old Dubbin if one half-
shut one's eyes. She half-shut her eyes. Suddenly she remembered - 
it was HE who had praised her eyes. "Your sister has the
brightest eyes I ever saw," he had said. Morris had told her. And
she had hidden her face behind a newspaper in the train going home
to conceal her pleasure. She looked at him again. He was talking.
She listened. He seemed too big for the quiet, English dining-
room; his voice boomed out. He wanted an audience.

He was telling a story. He spoke in clipped, nervous sentences as
if there were a ring round them - a style she admired, but she had
missed the beginning. His glass was empty.

"Give Sir William some more wine," Celia whispered to the nervous
parlour-maid. There was some juggling with decanters on the
sideboard. Celia frowned nervously. A girl from the village who
doesn't  know her job, Eleanor reflected. The story was reaching
its climax; but she had missed several links.

". . . and I found myself in an old pair of riding-breeches
standing under a peacock umbrella; and all the good people were
crouching with their heads to the ground. 'Good Lord,' I said to
myself, 'if they only knew what a bally ass I feel!'" He held out
his glass to be filled. "That's how we were taught our job in
those days," he added.

He was boasting, of course; that was natural. He came back to
England after ruling a district "about the size of Ireland," as
they always said; and nobody had ever heard of him. She had a
feeling that she would hear a great many more stories that sailed
serenely to his own advantage, during the week-end. But he talked
very well. He had done a great many interesting things. She
wished that Morris would tell stories too. She wished that he
would assert himself instead of leaning back and passing his hand - 
the hand with the cut on it - over his forehead.

Ought I to have urged him to go to the Bar? she thought. Her
father had been against it. But once it's done there it is; he
married; the children came; he had to go on, whether he wanted to
or not. How irrevocable things are, she thought. We make our
experiments, then they make theirs. She looked at her nephew North
and at her niece Peggy. They sat opposite her with the sun on
their faces. Their perfectly healthy egg-shell faces looked
extraordinarily young. Peggy's blue dress stuck out like a child's
muslin frock; North was still a brown-eyed cricketing boy. He was
listening intently; Peggy was looking down at her plate. She had
the non-committal look which well brought up children have when
they listen to the talk of their elders. She might be amused; or
bored? Eleanor could not be sure which it was.

"There he goes," Peggy said, suddenly looking up. "The owl . . ."
she said, catching Eleanor's eye. Eleanor turned to look out of
the window behind her. She missed the owl; she saw the heavy
trees, gold in the setting sun; and the cows slowly moving as they
munched their way across the meadow.

"You can time him," said Peggy, "he's so regular." Then Celia made
a move.

"Shall we leave the gentlemen to their politics," she said, "and
have our coffee on the terrace?" and they shut the door upon the
gentlemen and their politics.

"I'll fetch my glasses," said Eleanor, and she went upstairs.

She wanted to see the owl before it got too dark. She was becoming
more and more interested in birds. It was a sign of old age, she
supposed, as she went into her bedroom. An old maid who washes and
watches birds, she said to herself as she looked in the glass.
There were her eyes - they still seemed to her rather bright, in
spite of the lines round them - the eyes she had shaded in the
railway carriage because Dubbin praised them. But now I'm
labelled, she thought - an old maid who washes and watches birds.
That's what they think I am. But I'm not - I'm not in the least
like that, she said. She shook her head, and turned away from the
glass. It was a nice room; shady, civilised, cool after the
bedrooms in foreign inns, with marks on the wall where someone had
squashed bugs and men brawling under the window. But where were
her glasses? Put away in some drawer? She turned to look for
them.



"Did father say Sir William was in love with her?" Peggy asked as
they waited on the terrace.

"Oh I don't  know about that," said Celia. "But I wish they could
have married. I wish she had children of her own. And then they
could have settled here," she added. "He's such a delightful man."

Peggy was silent. There was a pause.

Celia resumed:

"I hope you were polite to the Robinsons this afternoon, dreadful
as they are. . . ."

"They give ripping parties anyhow," said Peggy.

"'Ripping, ripping,'" her mother complained half laughing. "I wish
you wouldn't  pick up all North's slang, my dear. . . . Oh, here's
Eleanor," she broke off.

Eleanor came out onto the terrace with her glasses, and sat down
beside Celia. It was still very warm; it was still light enough to
see the hills in the distance.

"He'll be back in a minute," said Peggy, drawing up a chair.
"He'll come along that hedge."

She pointed to the dark line of hedge that went across the meadow.
Eleanor focussed her glasses and waited.

"Now," said Celia, pouring out the coffee. "There are so many
things I want to ask you." She paused. She always had a hoard of
questions to ask; she had not seen Eleanor since April. In four
months questions accumulated. Out they came drop by drop.

"In the first place," she began. "No. . . ." She rejected that
question in favour of another.

"What's all this about Rose?" she asked.

"What?" said Eleanor absentmindedly, altering the focus of her
glasses. "It's getting too dark," she said; the field was blurred.

"Morris says she's been had up in a police-court," said Celia. She
dropped her voice slightly though they were alone.

"She threw a brick - " said Eleanor. She focused her glasses on the
hedge again. She held them poised in case the owl should come that
way again.

"Will she be put in prison?" Peggy asked quickly.

"Not this time," said Eleanor. "Next time - Ah, here he comes!" she
broke off. The blunt-headed bird came swinging along the hedge.
He looked almost white in the dusk. Eleanor got him within the
circle of her lens. He held a little black spot in front of him.

"He's got a mouse in his claws!" she exclaimed. "He's got a nest
in the steeple," said Peggy. The owl swooped out of the field of
vision.

"Now I can't  see him any more," said Eleanor. She lowered her
glasses. They were silent for a moment, sipping their coffee.
Celia was thinking of her next question; Eleanor anticipated her.

"Tell me about William Whatney," she said. "When I last saw him he
was a slim young man in a boat." Peggy burst out laughing.

"That must have been ages ago!" she said.

"Not so very long," said Eleanor. She felt rather nettled. "Well - "
she reflected, "twenty years - twenty-five years perhaps."

It seemed a very short time to her; but then, she thought, it was
before Peggy was born. She could only be sixteen or seventeen.

"Isn't  he a delightful man?" Celia exclaimed. "He was in India,
you know. Now he's retired, and we do hope he'll take a house
here; but Morris thinks he'd find it too dull."

They sat silent for a moment, looking out over the meadow. The
cows coughed now and then as they munched and moved a step further
through the grass. A sweet scent of cows and grass was wafted up
to them.

"It's going to be another hot day tomorrow," said Peggy. The sky
was perfectly smooth; it seemed made of innumerable grey-blue atoms
the colour of an Italian officer's cloak; until it reached the
horizon where there was a long bar of pure green. Everything
looked very settled; very still; very pure. There was not a single
cloud, and the stars were not yet showing.

It was small; it was smug; it was petty after Spain, but still, now
that the sun had sunk and the trees were massed together without
separate leaves it had its beauty, Eleanor thought. The downs were
becoming larger and simpler; they were becoming part of the sky.

"How lovely it is!" she exclaimed, as if she were making amends to
England after Spain.

"If only Mr Robinson doesn't  build!" sighed Celia; and Eleanor
remembered - they were the local scourge; rich people who threatened
to build. "I did my best to be polite to them at the bazaar
today," Celia continued. "Some people won't  ask them; but I say
one must be polite to neighbours in the country. . . ."

Then she paused. "There are so many things I want to ask you," she
said. The bottle was tilted on its end again. Eleanor waited
obediently.

"Have you had an offer for Abercorn Terrace yet?" Celia demanded.
Drop, drop, drop, out her questions came.

"Not yet," said Eleanor. "The agent wants me to cut it up into
flats."

Celia pondered. Then she hopped on again.

"And now about Maggie - when's her baby going to be born?"

"In November, I think," said Eleanor. "In Paris," she added.

"I hope it'll be all right," said Celia. "But I do wish it could
have been born in England." She reflected again. "Her children
will be French, I suppose?" she said.

"Yes; French, I suppose," said Eleanor. She was looking at the
green bar; it was fading; it was turning blue. It was becoming
night.

"Everybody says he's a very nice fellow," said Celia. "But René - 
René," her accent was bad, " - it doesn't  sound like a man's name."

"You can call him Renny," said Peggy, pronouncing it in the English
way.

"But that reminds me of Ronny; and I don't  like Ronny. We had a
stable-boy called Ronny."

"Who stole the hay," said Peggy. They were silent again, "It's
such a pity - " Celia began. Then she stopped. The maid had come
to clear away the coffee.

"It's a wonderful night, isn't  it?" said Celia, adapting her voice
to the presence of servants. "It looks as if it would never rain
again. In which case I don't  know. . . ." And she went on
prattling about the drought; about the lack of water. The well
always ran dry. Eleanor, looking at the hills, hardly listened.
"Oh, but there's quite enough for everybody at present," she heard
Celia saying. And for some reason she held the sentence suspended
without a meaning in her mind's ear, " - quite enough for everybody
at present," she repeated. After all the foreign languages she had
been hearing, it sounded to her pure English. What a lovely
language, she thought, saying over to herself again the commonplace
words, spoken by Celia quite simply, but with some indescribable
burr in the r's, for the Chinnerys had lived in Dorsetshire since
the beginning of time.

The maid had gone.

"What was I saying?" Celia resumed. "I was saying, It's such a
pity. Yes. . . ." But there was a sound of voices; a scent of
cigar smoke; the gentlemen were upon them. "Oh, here they are!"
she broke off. And the chairs were pulled up and re-arranged.

They sat in a semicircle looking across the meadows at the fading
hills. The broad bar of green that lay across the horizon had
vanished. Only a tinge was left in the sky. It had become
peaceful and cool; in them too something seemed to be smoothed out.
There was no need to talk. The owl flew down the meadow again;
they could just see the white of his wing against the dark of the
hedge.

"There he goes," said North, puffing at a cigar which was his
first, Eleanor guessed, Sir William's gift. The elm trees had
become dead black against the sky. Their leaves hung in a fretted
pattern like black lace with holes in it. Through a hole Eleanor
saw the point of a star. She looked up. There was another.

"It's going to be a fine day tomorrow," said Morris, knocking out
his pipe against his shoe. Far away on a distant road there was a
rattle of cart-wheels; then a chorus of voices singing - country
people going home. This is England, Eleanor thought to herself;
she felt as if she were slowly sinking into some fine mesh made of
branches shaking, hills growing dark, and leaves hanging like black
lace with stars among them. But a bat swooped low over their
heads.

"I hate bats!" Celia exclaimed, raising her hand to her head
nervously.

"Do you?" said Sir William. "I rather like them." His voice was
quiet and almost melancholy. Now Celia will say, They get into
one's hair, Eleanor thought.

"They get into one's hair," Celia said.

"But I haven't  any hair," said Sir William. His bald head, his
large face gleamed out in the darkness.

The bat swooped again, skimming the ground at their feet. A little
cool air stirred at their ankles. The trees had become part of the
sky. There was no moon, but the stars were coming out. There's
another, Eleanor thought, gazing at a twinkling light ahead of her.
But it was too low; too yellow; it was another house she realised,
not a star. And then Celia began talking to Sir William, whom she
wanted to settle near them; and Lady St. Austell had told her that
the Grange was to let. Was that the Grange, Eleanor wondered,
looking at a light, or a star? And they went on talking.



Tired of her own company, old Mrs Chinnery had come down early.
There she sat in the drawing-room waiting. She had made a formal
entry, but there was nobody there. Arrayed in her old lady's dress
of black satin, with a lace cap on her head, she sat waiting. Her
hawk-like nose was curved in her shrivelled cheeks; a little red
rim showed on one of her drooping eyelids.

"Why don't  they come in?" she said peevishly to Ellen, the discreet
black maid who stood behind her. Ellen went to the window and
tapped on the pane.

Celia stopped talking and turned round. "That's Mama," she said.
"We must go in." She got up and pushed back her chair.

After the dark, the drawing-room with its lamps lit had the effect
of a stage. Old Mrs Chinnery sitting in her wheeled chair with her
ear trumpet seemed to sit there awaiting homage. She looked
exactly the same; not a day older; as vigorous as ever. As Eleanor
bent to give her the customary kiss, life once more took on its
familiar proportions. So she had bent, night after night, over her
father. She was glad to stoop down; it made her feel younger
herself. She knew the whole procedure by heart. They, the middle-
aged, deferred to the very old; the very old were courteous to
them; and then came the usual pause. They had nothing to say to
her; she had nothing to say to them. What happened next? Eleanor
saw the old lady's eyes suddenly brighten. What made the eyes of
an old woman of ninety turn blue? Cards? Yes. Celia had fetched
the green baize table; Mrs Chinnery had a passion for whist. But
she too had her ceremony; she too had her manners.

"Not tonight," she said, making a little gesture as if to push away
the table. "I am sure it will bore Sir William?" She gave a nod
in the direction of the large man who stood there seeming a little
outside the family party.

"Not at all. Not at all," he said with alacrity. "Nothing would
please me more," he assured her.

You're a good fellow, Dubbin, Eleanor thought. And they drew up
the chairs; and dealt the cards; and Morris chaffed his mother-in-
law down her ear-trumpet and they played rubber after rubber.
North read a book; Peggy strummed on the piano; and Celia, dozing
over her embroidery, now and then gave a sudden start and put her
hand over her mouth. At last the door opened stealthily. Ellen,
the discreet black maid stood behind Mrs Chinnery's chair, waiting.
Mrs Chinnery pretended to ignore her, but the others were glad to
stop. Ellen stepped forward and Mrs Chinnery, submitting, was
wheeled off to the mysterious upper chamber of extreme old age.
Her pleasure was over.

Celia yawned openly.

"The bazaar," she said, rolling up her embroidery. "I shall go to
bed. Come, Peggy. Come, Eleanor."

North jumped up with alacrity to open the door. Celia lit the
brass candlesticks and began, rather heavily, to climb the stairs.
Eleanor followed after. But Peggy lagged behind. Eleanor heard
her whispering with her brother in the hall.

"Come along, Peggy," Celia called back over the banister as she
toiled upstairs. When she got to the landing at the top she
stopped under the picture of the little Chinnerys and called back
again rather sharply:

"Come, Peggy." There was a pause. Then Peggy came, reluctantly.
She kissed her mother obediently; but she did not look in the least
sleepy. She looked extremely pretty and rather flushed. She did
not mean to go to bed, Eleanor felt sure.



She went into her room and undressed. All the windows were open
and she heard the trees rustling in the garden. It was so hot
still that she lay in her nightgown on top of the bed with only the
sheet over her. The candle burnt its little pear-shaped flame on
the table by her side. She lay listening vaguely to the trees in
the garden; and watched the shadow of a moth that dashed round and
round the room. Either I must get up and shut the window or blow
out the candle, she thought drowsily. She did not want to do
either. She wanted to lie still. It was a relief to lie in the
semi-darkness after the talk, after the cards. She could still see
the cards falling; black, red and yellow; kings, queens and knaves;
on a green baize table. She looked drowsily round her. A nice
vase of flowers stood on the dressing-table; there was the polished
wardrobe and a china box by her bedside. She lifted the lid. Yes;
four biscuits and a pale piece of chocolate - in case she should be
hungry in the night. Celia had provided books too, The Diary of a
Nobody, Ruff's Tour in Northumberland and an odd volume of Dante,
in case she should wish to read in the night. She took one of the
books and laid it on the counterpane beside her. Perhaps because
she had been travelling, it seemed as if the ship were still
padding softly through the sea; as if the train were still swinging
from side to side as it rattled across France. She felt as if
things were moving past her as she lay stretched on the bed under
the single sheet. But it's not the landscape any longer, she
thought; it's people's lives, their changing lives.

The door of the pink bedroom shut. William Whatney coughed next
door. She heard him cross the room. Now he was standing by the
window, smoking a last cigar. What's he thinking, she wondered - 
about India? - how he stood under a peacock umbrella? Then he began
moving about the room, undressing. She could hear him take up a
brush and put it down again on his dressing-table. And it's to
him, she thought, remembering the wide sweep of his chin and the
floating stains of pink and yellow that lay underneath it, that I
owe that moment, which had been more than pleasure, when she hid
her face behind the newspaper in the corner of the third-class
railway carriage.

Now there were three moths dashing round the ceiling. They made a
little tapping noise as they dashed round and round from corner to
corner. If she left the window open much longer the room would be
full of moths. A board creaked in the passage outside. She
listened. Peggy, was it, escaping, to join her brother? She felt
sure there was some scheme on foot. But she could only hear the
heavy-laden branches moving up and down in the garden; a cow
lowing; a bird chirping, and then, to her delight, the liquid call
of an owl going from tree to tree looping them with silver.

She lay looking at the ceiling. A faint water mark appeared there.
It was like a hill. It reminded her of one of the great desolate
mountains in Greece or in Spain, which looked as if nobody had ever
set foot there since the beginning of time.

She opened the book that lay on the counterpane. She hoped it was
Ruff's Tour, or the Diary of a Nobody; but it was Dante, and she
was too lazy to change it. She read a few lines, here and there.
But her Italian was rusty; the meaning escaped her. There was a
meaning however; a hook seemed to scratch the surface of her mind.


 chč per quanti si dice piů lě nostro
 tanto possiede piů di ben ciascuno.


What did that mean? She read the English translation.


 For by so many more there are who say 'ours'
 So much the more of good doth each possess.


Brushed lightly by her mind that was watching the moths on the
ceiling, and listening to the call of the owl as it looped from
tree to tree with its liquid cry, the words did not give out their
full meaning, but seemed to hold something furled up in the hard
shell of the archaic Italian. I'll read it one of these days,
she thought, shutting the book. When I've  pensioned Crosby off,
when. . . . Should she take another house? Should she travel?
Should she go to India, at last? Sir William was getting into bed
next door, his life was over; hers was beginning. No, I don't  mean
to take another house, not another house, she thought, looking at
the stain on the ceiling. Again the sense came to her of a ship
padding softly through the waves; of a train swinging from side to
side down a railway-line. Things can't  go on for ever, she thought.
Things pass, things change, she thought, looking up at the ceiling.
And where are we going? Where? Where? . . . The moths were
dashing round the ceiling; the book slipped on to the floor.
Craster won the pig, but who was it won the silver salver? she
mused; made an effort; turned round, and blew out the candle.
Darkness reigned.



1913


It was January. Snow was falling; snow had fallen all day. The
sky spread like a grey goose's wing from which feathers were
falling all over England. The sky was nothing but a flurry of
falling flakes. Lanes were levelled; hollows filled; the snow
clogged the streams; obscured windows, and lay wedged against
doors. There was a faint murmur in the air, a slight crepitation,
as if the air itself were turning to snow; otherwise all was
silent, save when a sheep coughed, snow flopped from a branch, or
slipped in an avalanche down some roof in London. Now and again a
shaft of light spread slowly across the sky as a car drove through
the muffled roads. But as the night wore on, snow covered the
wheel ruts; softened to nothingness the marks of the traffic, and
coated monuments, palaces and statues with a thick vestment of
snow.



It was still snowing when the young man came from the House Agents
to see over Abercorn Terrace. The snow cast a hard white glare
upon the walls of the bathroom, showed up the cracks on the enamel
bath, and the stains on the wall. Eleanor stood looking out of the
window. The trees in the back garden were heavily lined with snow;
all the roofs were softly moulded with snow; it was still falling.
She turned. The young man turned too. The light was unbecoming to
them both, yet the snow - she saw it through the window at the end
of the passage - was beautiful, falling.

Mr Grice turned to her as they went downstairs,

"The fact is, our clients expect more lavatory accommodation
nowadays," he said, stopping outside a bedroom door.

Why can't  he say "baths" and have done with it, she thought.
Slowly she went downstairs. Now she could see the snow falling
through the panels of the hall door. As he went downstairs, she
noticed the red ears which stood out over his high collar; and the
neck which he had washed imperfectly in some sink at Wandsworth.
She was annoyed; as he went round the house, sniffing and peering,
he had indicted their cleanliness, their humanity; and he used
absurd long words. He was hauling himself up into the class above
him, she supposed, by means of long words. Now he stepped
cautiously over the body of the sleeping dog; took his hat from the
hall table, and went down the front door-steps in his business
man's buttoned boots, leaving yellow footprints in the thick white
cushion of snow. A four-wheeler was waiting.

Eleanor turned. There was Crosby, dodging about in her best bonnet
and mantle. She had been following Eleanor about the house like a
dog all the morning; the odious moment could no longer be put off.
Her four-wheeler was at the door; they had to say good-bye.

"Well, Crosby, it all looks very empty, doesn't  it?" said Eleanor,
looking in at the empty drawing-room. The white light of the snow
glared in on the walls. It showed up the marks on the walls where
the furniture had stood, where the pictures had hung.

"It does, Miss Eleanor," said Crosby. She stood looking too.
Eleanor knew that she was going to cry. She did not want her to
cry. She did not want to cry herself.

"I can still see you all sitting round that table, Miss Eleanor,"
said Crosby. But the table had gone. Morris had taken this; Delia
had taken that; everything had been shared out and separated.

"And the kettle that wouldn't  boil," said Eleanor. "D'you remember
that?" She tried to laugh.

"Oh, Miss Eleanor," said Crosby, shaking her head, "I remember
everything!" The tears were forming; Eleanor looked away into the
further room.

There too were marks on the wall, where the bookcase had stood,
where the writing-table had stood. She thought of herself sitting
there, drawing a pattern on the blotting-paper; digging a hole,
adding up tradesmen's books. . . . Then she turned. There was
Crosby. Crosby was crying. The mixture of emotions was positively
painful; she was so glad to be quit of it all, but for Crosby it
was the end of everything.

She had known every cupboard, flagstone, chair and table in that
large rambling house, not from five or six feet of distance as they
had known it; but from her knees, as she scrubbed and polished; she
had known every groove, stain, fork, knife, napkin and cupboard.
They and their doings had made her entire world. And now she was
going off, alone, to a single room at Richmond.

"I should think you'd be glad to be out of that basement anyhow,
Crosby," said Eleanor, turning into the hall again. She had never
realised how dark, how low it was, until, looking at it with "our
Mr Grice," she had felt ashamed.

"It was my home for forty years, Miss," said Crosby. The tears
were running. For forty years! Eleanor thought with a start. She
had been a little girl of thirteen or fourteen when Crosby came to
them, looking so stiff and smart. Now her blue gnat's eyes
protruded and her cheeks were sunk.

Crosby was stooping to put Rover on the chain.

"You're sure you want him?" said Eleanor, looking at the rather
smelly, wheezy and unattractive old dog. "We could easily find a
nice home for him in the country."

"Oh, miss, don't  ask me to give him up!" said Crosby. Tears
checked her speech. Tears were running freely down her cheeks.
For all Eleanor could do to prevent it, tears formed in her eyes
too.

"Dear Crosby, good-bye," she said. She bent and kissed her. She
had a curious dry quality of skin she noticed. But her own tears
were falling. Then Crosby, holding Rover on the chain, began to
edge sideways down the slippery steps. Eleanor, holding the door
open, looked after her. It was a dreadful moment; unhappy;
muddled; altogether wrong. Crosby was so miserable; she was so
glad. Yet as she held the door open her tears formed and fell.
They had all lived here; she had stood here to wave Morris to
school; there was the little garden in which they used to plant
crocuses. And now Crosby, with flakes of snow falling on her black
bonnet, climbed into the four-wheeler, holding Rover in her arms.
Eleanor shut the door and went in.



Snow was falling as the cab trotted along the streets. There were
long yellow ruts on the pavement where people, shopping, had
pressed it into slush. It was beginning to thaw slightly; loads of
snow slipped off the roofs and fell onto the pavement. Little
boys, too, were snowballing; one of them threw a ball which struck
the cab as it passed. But when it turned into Richmond Green the
whole of the vast space was completely white. Nobody seemed to
have crossed the snow there; everything was white. The grass was
white; the trees were white; the railings were white; the only
marks in the whole vista were the rooks, sitting huddled black on
the tree tops. The cab trotted on.

The carts had churned the snow to a yellowish clotted mixture by
the time the cab stopped in front of the little house off the
Green. Crosby, carrying Rover in her arms lest his feet should
mark the stairs, went up the steps. There was Louisa Burt standing
to welcome her; and Mr Bishop, the lodger from the top floor who
had been a butler. He lent a hand with the luggage, and Crosby
followed after, to her little room.



Her room was at the top, and at the back, overlooking the garden.
It was small, but when she had unpacked her things it was
comfortable enough. It had a look of Abercorn Terrace. Indeed for
many years she had been hoarding odds and ends with a view to her
retirement. Indian elephants, silver vases, the walrus that she
had found in the waste-paper basket one morning, when the guns were
firing for the old Queen's funeral - there they all were. She
ranged them askew on the mantelpiece, and when she had hung the
portraits of the family - some in wedding-dress, some in wigs and
gowns, and Mr Martin in his uniform in the middle because he was
her favourite - it was quite like home.

But whether it was the change to Richmond, or whether he had caught
cold in the snow, Rover sickened immediately. He refused his food.
His nose was hot. His eczema broke out again. When she tried to
take him shopping with her next morning he rolled over with his
feet in the air as if he begged to be left alone. Mr Bishop had to
tell Mrs Crosby - for she wore the courtesy title in Richmond - that
in his opinion the poor old chap  here he patted his head  was
better out of the way.

"Come along with me, my dear," said Mrs Burt, putting her arm on
Crosby's shoulder, "and let Bishop do it."

"He won't  suffer, I can assure you," said Mr Bishop, rising from
his knees. He had put her Ladyship's dogs to sleep scores of time
before this. "He'll just take one sniff" - Mr Bishop had his
pocket-handkerchief in his hand - "and he'll be off in a jiffy."

"It'll be for his good, Annie," Mrs Burt added, trying to draw her
away.

Indeed, the poor old dog looked very miserable. But Crosby shook
her head. He had wagged his tail; his eyes were open. He was
alive. There was a gleam of what she had long considered a smile
on his face. He depended on her, she felt. She was not going to
hand him over to strangers. She sat by his side for three days and
nights; she fed him with a teaspoon on Brand's Essence; but at last
he refused to open his lips; his body grew stiffer and stiffer; a
fly walked across his nose without its twitching. This was in the
early morning with the sparrows twittering on the trees outside.



"It's a mercy she's got something to distract her," said Mrs Burt
as Crosby passed the kitchen window the day after the funeral in
her best mantle and bonnet; for it was Thursday, when she fetched
Mr Pargiter's socks from Ebury Street. "But he ought to have been
put down long ago," she added, turning back to the sink. His
breath had smelt.



Crosby took the District Railway to Sloane Square and then she
walked. She walked slowly, with her elbows jutting out from her
sides as if to protect herself from the haphazardry of the streets.
She still looked sad; but the change from Richmond to Ebury Street
did her good. She felt more herself in Ebury Street than in
Richmond. A common sort of people lived in Richmond she always
felt. Here the ladies and gentlemen had the same kind of way with
them. She glanced approvingly into the shops as she passed. And
General Arbuthnot, who used to visit the Master, lived in Ebury
Street she reflected as she turned into that gloomy thoroughfare.
He was dead now; Louisa had shown her the notice in the papers.
But when he was alive, he had lived here. She had reached Mr
Martin's lodgings. She paused on the steps and adjusted her
bonnet. She always had a word with Martin when she came to fetch
his socks; it was one of her pleasures; and she enjoyed a gossip
with Mrs Briggs, his landlady. Today she would have the pleasure
of telling her of the death of Rover. Sidling cautiously down the
area steps which were slippery with sleet she stood at the back
door and rang the bell.



Martin sat in his room reading his newspaper. The war in the
Balkans was over; but there was more trouble brewing - that he was
sure. Quite sure. He turned the page. The room was very dark
with the sleet falling. And he could never read while he was
waiting. Crosby was coming; he could hear voices in the hall. How
they gossiped! How they chattered! he thought impatiently. He
threw the paper down and waited. Now she was coming; her hand was
on the door. But what was he to say to her? he wondered, as he saw
the handle turning. He put down the paper. He made use of the
usual formula: "Well, Crosby, how's the world treating you?" as
she came in.

She remembered Rover; and the tears started to her eyes.

Martin listened to the story; he wrinkled his brow sympathetically.
Then he got up, went into his bedroom, and came back holding a
pyjama jacket in his hand.

"What d'you call THAT, Crosby?" he said. He pointed to a hole
under the collar, fringed with brown. Crosby adjusted her gold-
rimmed spectacles.

"A burn, sir," she said with conviction.

"Brand new pyjamas; only worn them twice," said Martin, holding
them extended. Crosby touched them. They were made of the finest
silk, she could tell.

"Tut - tut - tut!" she said, shaking her head.

"Will you please take this pyjama to Mrs What's-her-name," he went
on, holding it out in front of him. He wanted to use a metaphor;
but one had to be very literal and use only the simplest language,
he remembered, when one talked to Crosby.

"Tell her to get another laundress," he concluded, "and send the
old one to the devil."

Crosby gathered the injured pyjama tenderly to her breast; Mr
Martin never could abide wool next the skin, she remembered.
Martin paused. One must pass the time of the day with Crosby, but
the death of Rover had seriously limited their topics of
conversation.

"How's the rheumatics?" he asked, as she stood very upright at the
door of the room with the pyjamas on her arm. She had grown
distinctly smaller, he thought. She shook her head, Richmond was
very low compared with Abercorn Terrace, she said. Her face
dropped. She was thinking of Rover, he supposed. He must get her
mind off that; he could not bear tears.

"Seen Miss Eleanor's new flat?" he asked. Crosby had. But she did
not like flats. In her opinion Miss Eleanor wore herself out.

"And the people's not worth it, sir," she said, referring to the
Zwinglers, Paravicinis and Cobbs who used to come to the back door
for cast-off clothing in the old days.

Martin shook his head. He could not think what to say next. He
hated talking to servants; it always made him feel insincere.
Either one simpers, or one's hearty, he was thinking. In either
case it's a lie.

"And are you keeping pretty well yourself, Master Martin?" Crosby
asked him, using the diminutive, which was a perquisite of her long
service.

"Not married yet, Crosby," said Martin.

Crosby cast her eye round the room. It was a bachelor's apartment,
with its leather chairs; its chessmen on top of a pile of books and
its soda-water syphon on a tray. She ventured to say that she was
sure that there were plenty of nice young ladies who would be very
glad to take care of him.

"Ah, but I like lying in bed of a morning," said Martin.

"You always did, sir," she said, smiling. And then it was possible
for Martin to take out his watch, step briskly to the window and
exclaim as if he had suddenly remembered an appointment,

"By Jove, Crosby, I must be off!" and the door shut upon Crosby.



It was a lie. He had no engagement. One always lies to servants,
he thought, looking out of the window. The mean outlines of the
Ebury Street houses showed through the falling sleet. Everybody
lies, he thought. His father had lied - after his death they had
found letters from a woman called Mira tied up in his table-drawer.
And he had seen Mira - a stout respectable lady who wanted help with
her roof. Why had his father lied? What was the harm of keeping a
mistress? And he had lied himself; about the room off the Fulham
Road where he and Dodge and Erridge used to smoke cheap cigars and
tell smutty stories. It was an abominable system, he thought;
family life; Abercorn Terrace. No wonder the house would not let.
It had one bathroom, and a basement; and there all those different
people had lived, boxed up together, telling lies.

Then as he stood at the window looking at the little figures
slinking along the wet pavement he saw Crosby come up the area
steps with a parcel under her arm. She stood for a moment, like a
frightened little animal, peering round her before she ventured to
brave the dangers of the street. At last, off she trotted. He saw
the snow falling on her black bonnet as she disappeared. He turned
away.



1914


It was a brilliant spring; the day was radiant. Even the air
seemed to have a burr in it as it touched the tree tops; it
vibrated, it rippled. The leaves were sharp and green. In the
country old church clocks rasped out the hour; the rusty sound went
over fields that were red with clover, and up went the rooks as if
flung by the bells. Round they wheeled; then settled on the tree
tops.

In London all was gallant and strident; the season was beginning;
horns hooted; the traffic roared; flags flew taut as trout in a
stream. And from all the spires of all the London churches - the
fashionable saints of Mayfair, the dowdy saints of Kensington, the
hoary saints of the city - the hour was proclaimed. The air over
London seemed a rough sea of sound through which circles travelled.
But the clocks were irregular, as if the saints themselves were
divided. There were pauses, silences. . . . Then the clocks
struck again.



Here in Ebury Street some distant frail-voiced clock was striking.
It was eleven. Martin, standing at his window, looked down on the
narrow street. The sun was bright; he was in the best of spirits;
he was going to visit his stockbroker in the city. His affairs
were turning out well. At one time, he was thinking, his father
had made a lot of money; then he lost it; then he made it; but in
the end he had done very well.

He stood at the window for a moment admiring a lady of fashion in a
charming hat who was looking at a pot in the curiosity shop
opposite. It was a blue pot on a Chinese stand with green brocade
behind it. The sloping symmetrical body, the depth of blue, the
little cracks in the glaze pleased him. And the lady looking at
the pot was also charming.

He took his hat and stick and went out into the street. He would
walk part of the way to the City. "The King of Spain's daughter"
he hummed as he turned up Sloane Street, "came to visit me. All
for the sake of. . . ." He looked into the shop windows as he
passed. They were full of summer dresses; charming confections of
green and gauze, and there were flights of hats stuck on little
rods. ". . . all for the sake of" he hummed as he walked on, "my
silver nutmeg tree." But what was a silver nutmeg tree he
wondered? An organ was fluting its merry little jig further down
the street. The organ moved round and round, shifted this way and
that, as if the old man who played it were half dancing to the
tune. A pretty servant girl ran up the area steps and gave him a
penny. His supple Italian face wrinkled all over as he whipped off
his cap and bowed to her. The girl smiled and slipped back into
the kitchen.

". . . all for the sake of my silver nutmeg tree" Martin hummed,
peering down through the area railings into the kitchen where they
were sitting. They looked very snug, with teapots and bread and
butter on the kitchen table. His stick swung from side to side
like the tail of a cheerful dog. Everybody seemed light-hearted
and irresponsible, sallying out of their houses, flaunting along
the streets with pennies for the organ-grinders and pennies for the
beggars. Everybody seemed to have money to spend. Women clustered
round the plate-glass windows. He too stopped, looked at the model
of a toy boat; at dressing-cases, shining yellow with rows of
silver bottles. But who wrote that song, he wondered, as he
strolled on, about the King of Spain's daughter, the song that
Pippy used to sing him, as she wiped his ears with a piece of slimy
flannel? She used to take him on her knee and croak out in her
wheezy rattle of a voice, "The King of Spain's daughter came to
visit me, all for the sake of. . . ." And then suddenly her knee
gave, and down he was tumbled onto the floor.

Here he was at Hyde Park Corner. The scene was extremely animated.
Vans, motor-cars, motor omnibuses were streaming down the hill.
The trees in the Park had little green leaves on them. Cars with
gay ladies in pale dresses were already passing in at the gates.
Everybody was going about their business. And somebody, he
observed, had written the words "God is Love" in pink chalk on the
gates of Apsley House. That must need some pluck, he thought, to
write "God is love" on the gates of Apsley House when at any moment
a policeman might nab you. But here came his bus; and he climbed
on top.

"To St. Paul's," he said, handing the conductor his coppers.



The omnibuses swirled and circled in a perpetual current round the
steps of St. Paul's. The statue of Queen Anne seemed to preside
over the chaos and to supply it with a centre, like the hub of a
wheel. It seemed as if the white lady ruled the traffic with her
sceptre; directed the activities of the little men in bowler hats
and round coats; of the women carrying attaché cases; of the vans,
the lorries and the motor omnibuses. Now and then single figures
broke off from the rest and went up the steps into the church. The
doors of the Cathedral kept opening and shutting. Now and again a
blast of faint organ music was blown out into the air. The pigeons
waddled; the sparrows fluttered. Soon after midday a little old
man carrying a paper bag took up his station half-way up the steps
and proceeded to feed the birds. He held out a slice of bread.
His lips moved. He seemed to be wheedling and coaxing them. Soon
he was haloed by a circle of fluttering wings. Sparrows perched on
his head and his hands. Pigeons waddled close to his feet. A
little crowd gathered to watch him feeding the sparrows. He tossed
his bread round him in a circle. Then there was a ripple in the
air. The great clock, all the clocks of the city, seemed to be
gathering their forces together; they seemed to be whirring a
preliminary warning. Then the stroke struck. "One" blared out.
All the sparrows fluttered up into the air; even the pigeons were
frightened; some of them made a little flight round the head of
Queen Anne.



As the last ripple of the stroke died away, Martin came out in the
open space in front of the Cathedral.

He crossed over and stood with his back against a shop window
looking up at the great dome. All the weights in his body seemed
to shift. He had a curious sense of something moving in his body
in harmony with the building; it righted itself: it came to a full
stop. It was exciting - this change of proportion. He wished he
had been an architect. He stood with his back pressed against the
shop trying to get the whole of the cathedral clear. But it was
difficult with so many people passing. They knocked against him
and brushed in front of him. It was the rush hour, of course, when
City men were making for their luncheons. They were taking short
cuts across the steps. The pigeons were swirling up and then
settling down again. The doors were opening and shutting as he
mounted the steps. The pigeons were a nuisance, he thought, making
a mess on the steps. He climbed up slowly.

"And who's that?" he thought, looking at someone who was standing
against one of the pillars. "Don't  I know her?"

Her lips were moving. She was talking to herself.

"It's Sally!" he thought. He hesitated; should he speak to her, or
should he not? But she was company; and he was tired of his own.

"A penny for your thoughts, Sal!" he said, tapping her on the
shoulder.

She turned; her expression changed instantly. "Just as I was
thinking of you, Martin!" she exclaimed.

"What a lie!" he said, shaking hands.

"When I think of people, I always see them," she said. She gave
her queer little shuffle as if she were a bird, a somewhat
dishevelled fowl, for her cloak was not in the fashion. They stood
for a moment on the steps, looking down at the crowded street
beneath. A gust of organ music came out from the Cathedral behind
them as the doors opened and shut. The faint ecclesiastical murmur
was vaguely impressive, and the dark space of the Cathedral seen
through the door.

"What were you thinking . . . ?" he began. But he broke off. "Come
and lunch," he said. "I'll take you to a City chop house," and he
shepherded her down the steps, along a narrow alley, blocked by
carts, into which packages were being shot from the warehouses.
They pushed through the swing doors into the chop house.

"Very full today, Alfred," said Martin affably, as the waiter took
his coat and hat and hung them on the rack. He knew the waiter; he
often lunched there; the waiter knew him too.

"Very full, Captain," he said.

"Now," he said, sitting down, "what shall we have?"

A vast brownish-yellow joint was being trundled from table to table
on a lorry.

"That," said Sara, waving her hand at it.

"And drink?" said Martin. He took the wine-list and consulted it.

"Drink - " said Sara, "drink, I leave to you." She took off her
gloves and laid them on a small reddish-brown book that was
obviously a prayer-book.

"Drink you leave to me," said Martin. Why, he wondered, do prayer-
books always have their leaves gilt with red and gold? He chose
the wine.

"And what were you doing," he said, dismissing the waiter, "at St.
Paul's?"

"Listening to the service," she said. She looked round her. The
room was very hot and crowded. The walls were covered with gold
leaves encrusted on a brown surface. People were passing them and
coming in and out all the time. The waiter brought the wine.
Martin poured her out a glass.

"I didn't  know you went to services," he said, looking at her
prayer-book.

She did not answer. She kept looking round her, watching the
people come in and go out. She sipped her wine. The colour was
coming into her cheeks. She took up her knife and fork and began
to eat the admirable mutton. They ate in silence for a moment.

He wanted to make her talk.

"And what, Sal," he said, touching the little book, "d'you make of
it?"

She opened the prayer-book at random and began to read:

"The father incomprehensible; the son incomprehensible - " she spoke
in her ordinary voice.

"Hush!" he stopped her. "Somebody's listening."

In deference to him she assumed the manner of a lady lunching with
a gentleman in a City restaurant.

"And what were you doing," she asked, "at St. Paul's?"

"Wishing I'd been an architect," he said. "But they sent me into
the Army instead, which I loathed." He spoke emphatically.

"Hush," she whispered. "Somebody's listening."

He looked round quickly; then he laughed. The waiter was setting
their tart in front of them. They ate in silence. He filled her
glass again. Her cheeks were flushed; her eyes were bright. He
envied her the generalised sensation of universal wellbeing that he
used to get from a glass of wine. Wine was good - it broke down
barriers. He wanted to make her talk.

"I didn't  know you went to services," he said, looking at her
prayer-book. "And what do you think of it?" She looked at it too.
Then she tapped it with her fork.

"What do THEY think of it, Martin?" she asked. "The woman praying
and the man with a long white beard?"

"Much what Crosby thinks when she comes to see me," he said. He
thought of the old woman standing at the door of his room with the
pyjama jacket over her arm, and the devout look on her face.

"I'm Crosby's God," he said, helping her to brussels sprouts.

"Crosby's God! Almighty, all-powerful Mr Martin!" She laughed.

She raised her glass to him. Was she laughing at him? he wondered.
He hoped she did not think him very old. "You remember Crosby,
don't  you?" he said. "She's retired, and her dog's dead."

"Retired and her dog's dead?" she repeated. She looked again over
her shoulder. Conversation in a restaurant was impossible; it was
broken into little fragments. City men in their neat striped suits
and bowler hats were brushing past them all the time.

"It's a fine church," she said, turning round. She had hopped back
to St. Paul's, he supposed.

"Magnificent," he replied. "Were you looking at the monuments?"

Somebody had come in whom he recognised: Erridge, the stockbroker.
He raised a finger and beckoned. Martin rose and went to speak to
him. When he came back she had filled her glass again. She was
sitting there, looking at the people, as if she were a child that
he had taken to a pantomime.

"And what are you doing this afternoon?" he asked.

"The Round Pond at four," she said. She drummed on the table "The
Round Pond at four." Now she had passed, he guessed, into the
drowsy benevolence which waits on a good dinner and a glass of
wine.

"Meeting somebody?" he asked.

"Yes. Maggie," she said.

They ate in silence. Fragments of other people's talk reached them
in broken sentences. Then the man to whom Martin had spoken
touched him on the shoulder as he went out.

"Wednesday at eight," he said.

"Right you are," said Martin. He made a note in his pocket-book.

"And what are you doing this afternoon?" she asked.

"Ought to see my sister in prison," he said, lighting a cigarette.

"In prison?" she asked.

"Rose. For throwing a brick," he said.

"Red Rose, tawny Rose," she began, reaching out her hand for the
wine again, "wild Rose, thorny Rose - "

"No," he said, putting his hand over the mouth of the bottle,
"you've  had enough." A little excited her. He must damp her
excitement. There were people listening.

"A damned unpleasant thing," he said, "being in prison."

She drew back her glass and sat gazing at it, as if the engine of
the brain were suddenly cut off. She was very like her mother - 
except when she laughed.

He would have liked to talk to her about her mother. But it was
impossible to talk. Too many people were listening, and they were
smoking. Smoke mixed with the smell of meat made the air heavy.
He was thinking of the past when she exclaimed:

"Sitting on a three-legged stool having meat crammed down her
throat!"

He roused himself. She was thinking of Rose, was she?

"Crash came a brick!" she laughed, flourishing her fork.

"'Roll up the map of Europe,' said the man to the flunkey. 'I
don't  believe in force'!" She brought down her fork. A plum-stone
jumped. Martin looked round. People were listening. He got up.

"Shall we go?" he said, " - if you've  had enough?"

She got up and looked for her cloak.

"Well, I've  enjoyed it," she said, taking her cloak. "Thanks,
Martin, for my good lunch."

He beckoned to the waiter who came with alacrity and totted up the
bill. Martin laid a sovereign on the plate. Sara began to thrust
her arms into the sleeves of her cloak.

"Shall I come with you," he said, helping her, "to the Round Pond
at four?"

"Yes!" she said, spinning round on her heel. "To the Round Pond at
four!"

She walked off, a little unsteadily he observed, past the City men
who were still eating.

Here the waiter came up with the change and Martin began to slip it
in his pocket. He kept back one coin for the tip. But as he was
about to give it, he was struck by something shifty in Alfred's
expression. He flicked up the flap of the bill; a two-shilling
piece lay beneath. It was the usual trick. He lost his temper.

"What's this?" he said angrily.

"Didn't  know it was there, sir," the waiter stammered.

Martin felt his blood rise to his ears. He felt exactly like his
father in a rage; as if he had white spots above his temples. He
pocketed the coin that he had been going to give the waiter; and
marched past him, brushing aside his hand. The man slunk back with
a murmur.

"Let's be off," he said, hustling Sara along the crowded room.
"Let's get out of this."

He hurried her into the street. The fug, the warm meaty smell of
the City chop-house, had suddenly become intolerable.

"How I hate being cheated!" he said as he put on his hat.

"Sorry, Sara," he apologised. "I oughtn't  to have taken you there.
It's a beastly hole."

He drew in a breath of fresh air. The street noises, the
unconcerned, business-like look of things, were refreshing after
the hot steamy room. There were the carts waiting, drawn up along
the street; and the packages sliding down into them from the
warehouses. Again they came out in front of St. Paul's. He looked
up. There was the same old man still feeding the sparrows. And
there was the Cathedral. He wished he could feel again the sense
of weights changing in his body and coming to a stop; but the queer
thrill of some correspondence between his own body and the stone no
longer came to him. He felt nothing except anger. Also, Sara
distracted him. She was about to cross the crowded road. He put
out his hand to stop her. "Take care," he said. Then they
crossed.

"Shall we walk?" he asked. She nodded. They began to walk along
Fleet Street. Conversation was impossible. The pavement was so
narrow that he had to step on and off in order to keep beside her.
He still felt the discomfort of anger, but the anger itself was
cooling. What ought I to have done? he thought, seeing himself
brush past the waiter without giving him a tip. Not that; he
thought, no, not that. People pressing against him made him step
off the pavement. After all, the poor devil had to make a living.
He liked being generous: he liked to leave people smiling; and two
shillings meant nothing to him. But what's the use, he thought,
now it's done? He began to hum his little song - and then stopped,
remembering that he was with someone.

"Look at that, Sal," he said, clutching at her arm. "Look at
that!"

He pointed at the splayed-out figure at Temple Bar; it looked as
ridiculous as usual - something between a serpent and a fowl.

"Look at that!" he repeated laughing. They paused for a moment to
look at the little flattened figures lodged so uncomfortably
against the pediment of Temple Bar: Queen Victoria: King Edward.
Then they walked on. It was impossible to talk because of the
crowd. Men in wigs and gowns hurried across the street: some
carried red bags, others blue bags.

"The Law Courts," he said, pointing at the cold mass of decorated
stone. It looked very gloomy and funereal, ". . . where Morris
spends his time," he said aloud.

He still felt uncomfortable at having lost his temper. But the
feeling was passing. Only a little ridge of roughness remained in
his mind.

"D'you think I ought to have been . . ." he began, a barrister he
meant; but also Ought I to have done that - lost his temper with the
waiter.

"Ought to have been - ought to have done?" she asked, bending
towards him. She had not caught his meaning in the roar of the
traffic. It was impossible to talk; but at any rate the feeling
that he had lost his temper was diminishing. That little sting was
being successfully smoothed over. Then back it came because he saw
a beggar selling violets. And that poor devil, he thought, had to
go without his tip because he cheated me. . . . He fixed his eyes
on a pillar-box. Then he looked at a car. It was odd how soon one
got used to cars without horses, he thought. They used to look
ridiculous. They passed the woman selling violets. She wore a hat
over her face. He dropped a sixpence in her tray to make amends to
the waiter. He shook his head. No violets, he meant; and indeed
they were faded. But he caught sight of her face. She had no
nose; her face was seamed with white patches; there were red rims
for nostrils. She had no nose - she had pulled her hat down to hide
that fact.

"Let's cross," he said, abruptly. He took Sara's arm and made her
cross between the omnibuses. She must have seen such sights often;
he had, often; but not together - that made a difference. He
hurried her on to the further pavement.

"We'll get a bus," he said, "Come along."

He took her by the elbow to make her step out briskly. But it was
impossible; a cart blocked the way; there were people passing.
They were approaching Charing Cross. It was like the piers of a
bridge; men and women were sucked in instead of water. They had to
stop. Newspaper boys held placards against their legs. Men were
buying papers: some loitered; others snatched them. Martin bought
one and held it in his hand.

"We'll wait here," he said. "The bus'll come." An old straw hat
with a purple ribbon round it, he thought opening his paper. The
sight persisted. He looked up. The station clock's always fast,
he assured a man who was hurrying to catch a train. Always fast,
he said to himself as he opened the paper. But there was no clock.
He turned to read the news from Ireland. Omnibus after omnibus
stopped, then swooped off again. It was difficult to concentrate
on the news from Ireland; he looked up.

"This is ours," he said, as the right bus came. They climbed on
top and sat side by side overlooking the driver.

"Two to Hyde Park Corner," he said, producing a handful of silver,
and looked through the pages of the evening paper; but it was only
an early edition.

"Nothing in it," he said, stuffing the paper under the seat. "And
now - " he began, filling his pipe. They were running smoothly down
the incline of Piccadilly. " - where my old father used to sit," he
broke off, waving his pipe at Club windows. ". . . and now" - he
lit a match, " - and now, Sally, you can say whatever you like.
Nobody's listening. Say something," he added, throwing his match
overboard, "very profound."

He turned to her. He wanted her to speak. Down they dipped; up
they swooped again. He wanted her to speak; or he must speak
himself. And what could he say? He had buried his feeling. But
some emotion remained. He wanted her to speak it: but she was
silent. No, he thought, biting the stem of his pipe. I won't  say
it. If I did she'd think me . . .

He looked at her. The sun was blazing on the windows of St.
George's Hospital. She was looking at it with rapture. But why
with rapture? he wondered, as the bus stopped and he got down.



The scene since the morning had changed slightly. Clocks in the
distance were just striking three. There were more cars; more
women in pale summer dresses; more men in tail-coats and grey top-
hats. The procession through the gates into the park was
beginning. Everyone looked festive. Even the little dressmakers'
apprentices with band-boxes looked as if they were taking part in
some ceremonial. Green chairs were drawn up at the edge of the
Row. They were full of people looking about them as if they had
taken seats at a play. Riders cantered to the end of the Row;
pulled up their horses; turned and cantered the other way. The
wind, coming from the west, moved white clouds grained with gold
across the sky. The windows of Park Lane shone with blue and gold
reflections.

Martin stepped out briskly.

"Come along," he said; "come - come!" He walked on. I'm young, he
thought; I'm in the prime of life. There was a tang of earth in
the air; even in the Park there was some faint smell of spring, of
the country.

"How I like - " he said aloud. He looked round. He had spoken to
the empty air. Sara had lagged behind; there she was, tying her
shoe-lace. But he felt as if he had missed a step going
downstairs.

"What a fool one feels when one talks aloud to oneself," he said as
she came up. She pointed.

"But look," she said, "they all do it."

A middle-aged woman was coming towards them. She was talking to
herself. Her lips moved; she was gesticulating with her hand.

"It's the spring," he said, as she passed them.

"No. Once in winter I came here," she said, "and there was a
negro, laughing aloud in the snow."

"In the snow," said Martin. "A negro." The sun was bright on the
grass; they were passing a bed in which the many-coloured hyacinths
were curled and glossy.

"Don't  let's think of the snow," he said. "Let's think - " A young
woman was wheeling a perambulator; a sudden thought came into his
head. "Maggie," he said. "Tell me. I haven't  seen her since her
baby was born. And I've  never met the Frenchman - what d'you call
him? - René?"

"Renny," she said. She was still under the influence of the wine;
of the wandering airs; of the people passing. He too felt the same
distraction; but he wanted to end it.

"Yes. What's he like, this man René; Renny?"

He pronounced the word first in the French way; then as she did, in
the English. He wanted to wake her. He took her arm.

"Renny!" Sara repeated. She threw her head back and laughed. "Let
me see," she said. "He wears a red tie with white spots. And has
dark eyes. And he takes an orange - suppose we're at dinner, and
says, looking straight at you, 'This orange, Sara - '" She rolled
her r's. She paused.

"There's another person talking to himself," she broke off. A
young man came past them in a closely buttoned-up coat as if he had
no shirt. He was muttering as he walked. He scowled at them as he
passed them.

"But Renny?" said Martin.

"We were talking about Renny," he reminded her. "He takes an
orange - "

". . . and pours himself out a glass of wine," she resumed.
"'Science is the religion of the future!'" she exclaimed, waving
her hand as if she held a glass of wine.

"Of wine?" said Martin. Half listening, he had visualised an
earnest French professor - a little picture to which now he must add
inappropriately a glass of wine.

"Yes, wine," she repeated. "His father was a merchant," she
continued. "A man with a black beard; a merchant at Bordeaux. And
one day," she continued, "when he was a little boy, playing in the
garden, there was a tap on the window. 'Don't  make so much noise.
Play further away,' said a woman in a white cap. His mother was
dead. . . . And he was afraid to tell his father that the horse
was too big to ride . . . and they sent him to England. . . ."

She was skipping over railings.

"And then what happened?" said Martin, joining her. "They became
engaged?"

She was silent. He waited for her to explain - why they had
married - Maggie and Renny. He waited, but she said no more. Well,
she married him and they're happy he thought. He was jealous for a
moment. The Park was full of couples walking together. Everything
seemed fresh and full of sweetness. The air puffed soft in their
faces. It was laden with murmurs; with the stir of branches; the
rush of wheels; dogs barking, and now and again the intermittent
song of a thrush.

Here a lady passed them, talking to herself. As they looked at her
she turned and whistled, as if to her dog. But the dog she had
whistled was another person's dog. It bounded off in the opposite
direction. The lady hurried on pursing her lips together.

"People don't  like being looked at," said Sara, "when they're
talking to themselves." Martin roused himself.

"Look here," he said. "We've  gone the wrong way." Voices floated
out to them.

They had been walking in the wrong direction. They were near the
bald rubbed space where the speakers congregate. Meetings were in
full swing. Groups had gathered round the different orators.
Mounted on their platforms, or sometimes only on boxes, the
speakers were holding forth. The voices became louder, louder and
louder as they approached.

"Let's listen," said Martin. A thin man was leaning forward
holding a slate in his hand. They could hear him say, "Ladies and
gentlemen . . ." They stopped in front of him. "Fix your eyes on
me," he said. They fixed their eyes on him. "Don't  be afraid," he
said, crooking his finger. He had an ingratiating manner. He
turned his slate over. "Do I look like a Jew?" he asked. Then he
turned his slate and looked on the other side. And they heard him
say that his mother was born in Bermondsey, as they strolled on,
and his father in the Isle of - The voice died away.

"What about this chap?" said Martin. Here was a large man, banging
on the rail of his platform.

"Fellow citizens!" he was shouting. They stopped. The crowd of
loafers, errand-boys and nursemaids gaped up at him with their
mouths falling open and their eyes gazing blankly. His hand raked
in the line of cars that was passing with a superb gesture of
scorn. His shirt appeared under his waistcoat.

"Joostice and liberty," said Martin, repeating his words, as the
fist thumped on the railing. They waited. Then it all came over
again.

"But he's a jolly good speaker," said Martin, turning. The voice
died away. "And now, what's the old lady saying?" They strolled
on.

The old lady's audience was extremely small. Her voice was hardly
audible. She held a little book in her hand and she was saying
something about sparrows. But her voice tapered off into a thin
frail pipe. A chorus of little boys imitated her.

They listened for a moment. Then Martin turned again. "Come
along, Sall," he said, putting his hand on her shoulder.

The voices grew fainter, fainter and fainter. Soon they ceased
altogether. They strolled on across the smooth slope that rose and
fell like a breadth of green cloth striped with straight brown
paths in front of them. Great white dogs were gambolling; through
the trees shone the waters of the Serpentine, set here and there
with little boats. The urbanity of the Park, the gleam of the
water, the sweep and curve and composition of the scene, as if
somebody had designed it, affected Martin agreeably.

"Joostice and liberty," he said half to himself, as they came to
the water's edge and stood a moment, watching the gulls cut the air
into sharp white patterns with their wings.

"Did you agree with him?" he asked, taking Sara's arm to rouse her;
for her lips were moving; she was talking to herself. "That fat
man," he explained, "who flung his arm out." She started.

"Oi, oi, oi!" she exclaimed, imitating his cockney accent.

Yes, thought Martin, as they walked on. Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi.
It's always that. There wouldn't  be much justice or liberty for
the likes of him if the fat man had his way - or beauty either.

"And the poor old lady whom nobody listened to?" he said, "talking
about the sparrows. . . ."

He could still see in his mind's eye the thin man persuasively
crooking his finger; the fat man who flung his arms out so that his
braces showed; and the little old lady who tried to make her voice
heard above the cat-calls and whistles. There was a mixture of
comedy and tragedy in the scene.

But they had reached the gate into Kensington Gardens. A long row
of cars and carriages was drawn up by the kerb. Striped umbrellas
were open over the little round tables where people were already
sitting, waiting for their tea. Waitresses were hurrying in and
out with trays; the season had begun. The scene was very gay.

A lady, fashionably dressed with a purple feather dipping down on
one side of her hat, sat there sipping an ice. The sun dappled the
table and gave her a curious look of transparency, as if she were
caught in a net of light; as if she were composed of lozenges of
floating colours. Martin half thought that he knew her; he half
raised his hat. But she sat there looking in front of her; sipping
her ice. No, he thought; he did not know her, and he stopped for a
moment to light his pipe. What would the world be, he said to
himself - he was still thinking of the fat man brandishing his arm - 
without "I" in it? He lit the match. He looked at the flame that
had become almost invisible in the sun. He stood for a second
drawing at his pipe. Sara had walked on. She too was netted with
floating lights from between the leaves. A primal innocence seemed
to brood over the scene. The birds made a fitful sweet chirping in
the branches; the roar of London encircled the open space in a ring
of distant but complete sound. The pink and white chestnut
blossoms rode up and down as the branches moved in the breeze. The
sun dappling the leaves gave everything a curious look of
insubstantiality as if it were broken into separate points of
light. He too, himself, seemed dispersed. His mind for a moment
was a blank. Then he roused himself, threw away his match, and
caught up Sally.

"Come along!" he said. "Come along. . . . The Round Pond at
four!"

They walked on arm in arm in silence, down the long avenue with the
Palace and the phantom church at the end of its vista. The size of
the human figure seemed to have shrunk. Instead of full-grown
people, children were now in the majority. Dogs of all sorts
abounded. The air was full of barking and sudden shrill cries.
Coveys of nursemaids pushed perambulators along the paths. Babies
lay fast asleep in them like images of faintly tinted wax; their
perfectly smooth eyelids fitted over their eyes as if they sealed
them completely. He looked down; he liked children. Sally had
looked like that the first time he saw her, asleep in her
perambulator in the hall in Browne Street.

He stopped short. They had reached the Pond.

"Where's Maggie?" he said. "There - is that her?" He pointed to a
young woman who was lifting a baby out of its perambulator under a
tree.

"Where?" said Sara. She looked in the wrong direction.

He pointed.

"There, under that tree."

"Yes," she said, "that's Maggie."

They walked in that direction.

"But is it?" said Martin. He was suddenly doubtful; for she had
the unconsciousness of a person who is unaware that she is being
looked at. It made her unfamiliar. With one hand she held the
child; with the other she arranged the pillows of the perambulator.
She too was dappled with lozenges of floating light.

"Yes," he said, noticing something about her gesture, "that's
Maggie."

She turned and saw them.

She held up her hand as if to warn them to approach quietly. She
put a finger to her lips. They approached silently. As they
reached her, the distant sound of a clock striking was wafted on
the breeze. One, two, three, four it struck. . . . Then it
ceased.



"We met at St. Paul's," said Martin in a whisper. He dragged up
two chairs and sat down. They were silent for a moment. The child
was not asleep. Then Maggie bent over and looked at the child.

"You needn't  talk in a whisper," she said aloud. "He's asleep."

"We met at St. Paul's," Martin repeated in his ordinary voice.
"I'd been seeing my stockbroker." He took off his hat and laid
it on the grass. "And when I came out," he resumed, "there was
Sally. . . ." He looked at her. She had never told him, he
remembered, what it was that she was thinking, as she stood there,
with her lips moving, on the steps of St. Paul's.

Now she was yawning. Instead of taking the little hard green chair
which he had pulled up for her, she had thrown herself down on the
grass. She had folded herself like a grasshopper with her back
against the tree. The prayer-book, with its red and gold leaves,
was lying on the ground tented over with trembling blades of grass.
She yawned; she stretched. She was already half asleep.

He drew his chair beside Maggie's; and looked at the scene in front
of them.

It was admirably composed. There was the white figure of Queen
Victoria against a green bank; beyond, was the red brick of the old
palace; the phantom Church raised its spire, and the Round Pond
made a pool of blue. A race of yachts was going forward. The
boats leant on their sides so that the sails touched the water.
There was a nice little breeze.

"And what did you talk about?" said Maggie.

Martin could not remember. "She was tipsy," he said, pointing to
Sara. "And now she's going to sleep." He felt sleepy himself.
The sun for the first time was almost hot on his head.

Then he answered her question.

"The whole world," he said, "Politics; religion; morality." He
yawned. Gulls were screaming as they rose and sank over a lady who
was feeding them. Maggie was watching them. He looked at her.

"I haven't  seen you," he said, 'since your baby was born." It's
changed her, having a child, he thought. It's improved her, he
thought. But she was watching the gulls; the lady had thrown a
handful of fish. The gulls swooped round and round her head.

"D'you like having a child?" he said.

"Yes," she said, rousing herself to answer him. "It's a tie
though."

"But it's nice having ties, isn't  it?" he enquired. He was fond of
children. He looked at the sleeping baby with its eyes sealed and
its thumb in its mouth.

"D'you want them?" she asked.

"Just what I was asking myself," he said, "before - "

Here Sara made a click at the back of her throat; he dropped his
voice to a whisper. "Before I met her at St. Paul's," he said.
They were silent. The baby was asleep; Sara was asleep; the
presence of the two sleepers seemed to enclose them in a circle of
privacy. Two of the racing yachts were coming together as if they
must collide; but one passed just ahead of the other. Martin
watched them. Life had resumed its ordinary proportions.
Everything once more was back in its place. The boats were
sailing; the men walking; the little boys dabbled in the pond for
minnows; the waters of the pond rippled bright blue. Everything
was full of the stir, the potency, the fecundity of spring.

Suddenly he said aloud:

"Possessiveness is the devil."

Maggie looked at him. Did he mean herself - herself and the baby?
No. There was a tone in his voice that told her he was thinking
not of her.

"What are you thinking?" she asked.

"About the woman I'm in love with," he said. "Love ought to stop
on both sides, don't  you think, simultaneously?" He spoke without
any stress on the words, so as not to wake the sleepers. "But it
won't  - that's the devil," he added in the same undertone.

"Bored, are you?" she murmured.

"Stiff," he said. "Bored stiff." He stooped and disinterred a
pebble in the grass.

"And jealous?" she murmured. Her voice was very low and soft.

"Horribly," he whispered. It was true, now that she referred to
it. Here the baby half woke and stretched out its hand. Maggie
rocked the perambulator. Sara stirred. Their privacy was
imperilled. It would be destroyed at any moment, he felt; and he
wanted to talk.

He glanced at the sleepers. The baby's eyes were shut, and Sara's
too. Still they seemed encircled in a ring of solitude. Speaking
in a low voice without accent, he told her his story; the story of
the lady; how she wanted to keep him, and he wanted to be free. It
was an ordinary story, but painful - mixed. As he told it, however,
the sting was drawn. They sat silent, looking in front of them.

Another race was starting; men crouched at the edge of the pond,
each with his stick resting on a toy boat. It was a charming
scene, gay, innocent and a trifle ridiculous. The signal was
given; off the boats went. And will he, Martin thought, looking at
the sleeping baby, go through the same thing too? He was thinking
of himself - of his jealousy.

"My father," he said suddenly, but softly, "had a lady. . . . She
called him 'Bogy'." And he told her the story of the lady who kept
a boarding house at Putney - the very respectable lady, grown stout,
who wanted help with her roof. Maggie laughed, but very gently, so
as not to wake the sleepers. Both were still sleeping soundly.

"Was he in love," Martin asked her, "with your mother?"

She was looking at the gulls, cutting patterns on the blue distance
with their wings. His question seemed to sink through what she was
seeing; then suddenly it reached her.

"Are we brother and sister?" she asked; and laughed out loud. The
child opened its eyes, and uncurled its fingers.

"We've  woken him," said Martin. He began to cry. Maggie had to
soothe him. Their privacy was over. The child cried; and the
clocks began striking. The sound came wafted gently towards them
on the breeze. One, two, three, four, five. . . .

"It's time to go," said Maggie, as the last stroke died away. She
laid the baby back on its pillow, and turned. Sara was still
asleep. She lay crumpled up with her back to the tree. Martin
stooped and threw a twig at her. She opened her eyes but shut them
again.

"No, no," she protested, stretching her arms over her head.

"It's time," said Maggie. She pulled herself up. "Time is it?"
she sighed. "How strange . . . !" she murmured. She sat up and
rubbed her eyes.

"Martin!" she exclaimed. She looked at him as he stood over her in
his blue suit holding his stick in his hand. She looked at him as
if she were bringing him back to the field of vision.

"Martin!" she said again.

"Yes, Martin!" he replied. "Did you hear what we've  been saying?"
he asked her.

"Voices," she yawned, shaking her head. "Only voices."

He paused for a moment, looking down at her. "Well, I'm off," he
said, taking up his hat, "to dine with a cousin in Grosvenor
Square," he added. He turned and left them.

He looked back at them after he had gone a little distance. They
were still sitting by the perambulator under the trees. He walked
on. Then he looked back again. The ground sloped, and the trees
were hidden. A very stout lady was being tugged along the path by
a small dog on a chain. He could see them no longer.



The sun was setting as he drove across the Park, an hour or two
later. He was thinking that he had forgotten something; but what,
he did not know. Scene passed over scene; one obliterated another.
Now he was crossing the bridge over the Serpentine. The water
glowed with sunset light; twisted poles of lamp light lay on the
water, and there, at the end the white bridge composed the scene.
The cab entered the shadow of the trees, and joined the long line
of cabs that was streaming towards the Marble Arch. People in
evening dress were going to plays and parties. The light became
yellower and yellower. The road was beaten to a metallic silver.
Everything looked festive.

But I'm going to be late, he thought, for the cab was held up in a
block by the Marble Arch. He looked at his watch - it was just on
eight-thirty. But eight-thirty means eight-forty-five he thought,
as the cab moved on. Indeed as it turned into the square there was
a car at the door, and a man getting out. So I'm just on time, he
thought, and paid the driver.



The door opened almost before he touched the bell, as if he had
trod on a spring. The door opened, and two footmen started forward
to take his things directly he entered the black-and-white paved
hall. He followed another man up the imposing staircase of white
marble, sweeping in a curve. A succession of large, dark pictures
hung on the wall, and at the top outside the door was a yellow-and-
blue picture of Venetian palaces and pale green canals.

"Canaletto or the school of?" he thought, pausing to let the other
man precede him. Then he gave his name to the footman.

"Captain Pargiter," the man boomed out; and there was Kitty
standing at the door. She was formal; fashionable; with a dash of
red on her lips. She gave him her hand; but he moved on for other
guests were arriving. "A saloon?" he said to himself, for the room
with its chandeliers, yellow panels, and sofas and chairs dotted
about had the air of a grandiose waiting-room. Seven or eight
people were already there. It's not going to work this time, he
said to himself as he chatted with his host, who had been racing.
His face shone as if it had only that moment been taken out of the
sun. One almost expected, Martin thought, as he stood talking, to
see a pair of glasses slung round his shoulders, just as there was
a red mark across his forehead where his hat had been. No, it's
not going to work, Martin thought as they talked about horses. He
heard a paper boy calling in the street below, and the hooting of
horns. He preserved clearly his sense of the identity of different
objects, and their differences. When a party worked all things,
all sounds merged into one. He looked at an old lady with a wedge-
shaped stone-coloured face sitting ensconced on a sofa. He glanced
at Kitty's portrait by a fashionable portrait painter as he
chatted, standing first on this foot, then on that, to the grizzled
man with the bloodhound eyes and the urbane manner whom Kitty had
married instead of Edward. Then she came up and introduced him to
a girl all in white who was standing alone with her hand on the
back of a chair.

"Miss Ann Hillier," she said. "My cousin, Captain Pargiter."

She stood for a moment beside them as if to facilitate their
introduction. But she was a little stiff always; she did nothing
but flick her fan up and down.

"Been to the races, Kitty?" Martin said, because he knew that she
hated racing, and he always felt a wish to tease her.

"I? No; I don't  go to races," she replied rather shortly. She
turned away because somebody else had come in - a man in gold lace,
with a star.

I should have been better off, Martin thought, reading my book.

"Have you been to the races?" he said aloud to the girl whom he was
to take down to dinner. She shook her head. She had white arms; a
white dress; and a pearl necklace. Purely virginal, he said to
himself; and only an hour ago I was lying stark naked in my bath in
Ebury Street, he thought.

"I've  been watching polo," she said. He looked down at his shoes,
and noticed that they had creases across them; they were old; he
had meant to buy a new pair, but had forgotten. That was what he
had forgotten, he thought, seeing himself again in the cab,
crossing the bridge over the Serpentine.

But they were going down to dinner. He gave her his arm. As they
went down the stairs, and he watched the ladies' dresses in front
of them trail from step to step, he thought, What on earth am I
going to say to her? Then they crossed the black-and-white squares
and went into the dining-room. It was harmoniously shrouded;
pictures with hooded bars of light under them shone out; and the
dinner table glowed; but no light shone directly on their faces.
If this doesn't  work, he thought, looking at the portrait of a
nobleman with a crimson cloak and a star that hung luminous in
front of him, I'll never do it again. Then he braced himself to
talk to the virginal girl who sat beside him. But he had to reject
almost everything that occurred to him - she was so young.

"I've  thought of three subjects to talk about," he began straight
off, without thinking how the sentence was to end. "Racing; the
Russian ballet; and" - he hesitated for a moment - "Ireland. Which
interests you?" He unfolded his napkin.

"Please," she said, bending slightly towards him, 'say that again."

He laughed. She had a charming way of putting her head on one side
and bending towards him.

"Don't  let's talk of any of them," he said. "Let's talk of
something interesting. Do you enjoy parties?" he asked her. She
was dipping her spoon in her soup. She looked up at him as she
lifted it with eyes that seemed like bright stones under a film of
water. They're like drops of glass under water, he thought. She
was extraordinarily pretty.

"But I've  only been to three parties in my life!" she said. She
gave a charming little laugh.

"You don't  say so!" he exclaimed. "This is the third, then; or is
it the fourth?"

He listened to the sounds in the street. He could just hear the
cars hooting; but they had gone far away; they made a continuous
rushing noise. It was beginning to work. He held out his glass.
He would like her to say, he thought, as his glass was filled,
"What a charming man I sat next!" when she went to bed that night.

"This is my third REAL party," she said, stressing the word "real"
in a way that seemed to him slightly pathetic. She must have been
in the nursery three months ago, he thought, eating bread and
butter.

"And I was thinking as I shaved," he said, "that I would never go
to a party again." It was true; he had seen a hole in the
bookcase. Who's taken my life of Wren? he had thought, holding his
razor out; and had wanted to stay and read, alone. But now - what
little piece of his vast experience could he break off and give to
her, he wondered?

"Do you live in London?" she asked.

"Ebury Street," he told her. And she knew Ebury Street, because it
was on the way to Victoria; she often went to Victoria, because
they had a house in Sussex.

"And now tell me," he said, feeling that they had broken the ice - 
when she turned her head to answer some remark of the man on the
other side. He was annoyed. The whole fabric that he had been
building, like a game of spillikins in which one frail little bone
is hooked on top of another, was dashed to the ground. Ann was
talking as if she had known the other man all her life; he had hair
that looked as if a rake had been drawn through it; he was very
young. Martin sat silent. He looked at the great portrait
opposite. A footman was standing beneath it; a row of decanters
obscured the folds of the cloak on the floor. That's the third
Earl, or the fourth? he asked himself. He knew his eighteenth
century; it was the fourth Earl who had made the great marriage.
But after all, he thought, looking at Kitty at the head of the
table, the Rigbys are a better family than they are. He smiled; he
checked himself. I only think of "better families" when I dine in
this sort of place, he thought. He looked at another picture; a
lady in sea green; the famous Gainsborough. But here Lady
Margaret, the woman on his left, turned to him.

"I'm sure you'll agree with me," she said, "Captain Pargiter" - he
noticed that she swept her eyes over the name on his card before
she spoke it, although they had met often before - "that it's a
devilish thing to have done?"

She spoke so pouncingly that the fork she held upright seemed like
a weapon with which she was about to pinion him. He threw himself
into their conversation. It was about politics of course, about
Ireland. "Tell me - what's your opinion?" she asked, with her fork
poised. For a moment he had the illusion that he too was behind
the scenes. The screen was down; the lights were up; and he too
was behind the scenes. It was an illusion of course; they were
only throwing him scraps from their larder; but it was an agreeable
sensation while it lasted. He listened. Now she was holding forth
to a distinguished old man at the end of the table. He watched
him. He had let down a mask of infinitely wise tolerance over his
face as she harangued them. He was arranging three crusts of bread
by the side of his plate as if he were playing a mysterious little
game of profound significance. "So," he seemed to be saying, "So,"
as if they were fragments of human destiny, not crusts, that he
held in his fingers. The mask might conceal anything - or nothing?
Anyhow it was a mask of great distinction. But here Lady Margaret
pinioned him too with her fork; and he raised his eyebrows and
moved one of the crusts a little to one side before he spoke.
Martin leant forward to listen.

"When I was in Ireland," he began, "in 1880 . . ." He spoke very
simply; he was offering them a memory; he told his story perfectly;
it held its meaning without spilling a single drop. And he had
played a great part. Martin listened attentively. Yes, it was
absorbing. Here we are, he thought, going on and on and on. . . .
He leant forward trying to catch every word. But he was conscious
of some interruption; Ann had turned to him.

"Do tell me" - she was asking him - "who HE is?" She bent her head
to the right. She was under the impression that he knew everybody,
apparently. He was flattered. He looked along the table. Who was
it? Somebody he had met; somebody, he guessed, who was not quite
at his ease.

"I know him," he said. "I know him - " He had a rather white, fat
face; he was talking away at a great rate. And the young married
woman to whom he was talking was saying "I see; I see," with little
nods of her head. But there was a slight look of strain on her
face. You needn't  put yourself to all that trouble, my good
fellow, Martin felt inclined to say to him. She doesn't  understand
a word you're saying.

"I can't  put a name to him," he said aloud. "But I've  met him - let
me see - where? In Oxford or Cambridge?"

A faint look of amusement came into Ann's eyes. She had spotted
the difference. She coupled them together. They were not her
world - no.

"Have you seen the Russian dancers?" she was saying. She had been
there with her young man, it seemed. And what's your world, Martin
thought, as she rapped out her slender stock of adjectives - 
"heavenly," "amazing," "marvellous," and so on. Is it "the" world?
he mused. He looked down the table. Anyhow no other world had a
chance against it, he thought. And it's a good world too, he
added; large; generous; hospitable. And very nice-looking. He
glanced from face to face. Dinner was drawing to an end. They all
looked as if they had been rubbed with wash leather, like precious
stones; yet the bloom seemed ingrained; it went through the stone.
And the stone was clear-cut; there was no blur, no indecision.
Here a footman's white-gloved hand removing dishes knocked over a
glass of wine. A red splash trickled onto the lady's dress. But
she did not move a muscle; she went on talking. Then she
straightened the clean napkin that had been brought her,
nonchalantly, over the stain.

That's what I like, Martin thought. He admired that. She would
have blown her fingers on her nose like an applewoman if she wanted
to, he thought. But Ann was talking.

"And when he gives that leap!" she exclaimed - she raised her hand
with a lovely gesture in the air - "and then comes down!" She let
her hand fall in her lap.

"Marvellous!" Martin agreed. He had got the very accent, he
thought; he had got it from the young man whose hair looked as if a
rake had gone through it.

"Yes: Nijinsky's marvellous," he agreed. "Marvellous," he
repeated.

"And my aunt has asked me to meet him at a party," said Ann.

"Your aunt?" he said aloud.

She mentioned a well-known name.

"Oh, she's your aunt, is she?" he said. He placed her. So THAT
was her world. He wanted to ask her - for he found her charming in
her youth, her simplicity - but it was too late. Ann was rising.

"I hope - " he began. She bent her head towards him as if she
longed to stay, catch his last word, his least word; but could not,
since Lady Lasswade had risen; and it was time for her to go.

Lady Lasswade had risen; everybody rose. All the pink, grey, sea-
coloured dresses lengthened themselves, and for a moment the tall
women standing by the table looked like the famous Gainsborough
hanging on the wall. The table, strewn with napkins and wine-
glasses, had a derelict air as they left it. For a moment the
ladies clustered at the door; then the little old woman in black
hobbled past them with remarkable dignity; and Kitty, coming last,
put her arm round Ann's shoulder and led her out. The door shut on
the ladies.



Kitty paused for a moment.

"I hope you liked my old cousin?" she said to Ann as they walked
upstairs together. She put her hand to her dress and straightened
something as they passed a looking-glass.

"I thought him charming!" Ann exclaimed. "And what a lovely tree!"
She spoke of Martin and the tree in exactly the same tone. They
paused for a moment to look at a tree that was covered with pink
blossoms in a china tub standing at the door. Some of the flowers
were fully out; others were still unopened. As they looked a petal
dropped.

"It's cruel to keep it here," said Kitty, "in this hot air."

They went in. While they dined the servants had opened the folding
doors and lit lights in a further room so that it seemed as if they
came into another room freshly made ready for them. There was a
great fire blazing between two stately fire-dogs; but it seemed
cordial and decorative rather than hot. Two or three of the ladies
stood before it, opening and shutting their fingers as they spread
them to the blaze; but they turned to make room for their hostess.

"How I love that picture of you, Kitty!" said Mrs Aislabie, looking
up at the portrait of Lady Lasswade as a young woman. Her hair had
been very red in those days; she was toying with a basket of roses.
Fiery but tender, she looked, emerging from a cloud of white
muslin.

Kitty glanced at it and then turned away.

"One never likes one's own picture," she said.

"But it's the image of you!" said another lady.

"Not now," said Kitty, laughing off the compliment rather
awkwardly. Always after dinner women paid each other compliments
about their clothes or their looks, she thought. She did not like
being alone with women after dinner; it made her shy. She stood
there, upright among them, while footmen went round with trays of
coffee.

"By the way, I hope the wine - " she paused and helped herself to
coffee, "the wine didn't  stain your frock, Cynthia?" she said to
the young married woman who had taken the disaster so coolly.

"And such a lovely frock," said Lady Margaret, fondling the folds
of golden satin between her finger and thumb.

"D'you like it?" said the young woman.

"It's perfectly lovely! I've  been looking at it the whole
evening!" said Mrs Treyer, an Oriental-looking woman, with a
feather floating back from her head in harmony with her nose, which
was Jewish.

Kitty looked at them admiring the lovely frock. Eleanor would have
found herself out of it, she thought. She had refused her
invitation to dinner. That annoyed her.

"Do tell me," Lady Cynthia interrupted, "who was the man I sat
next? One always meets such interesting people at your house," she
added.

"The man you sat next?" said Kitty. She considered a moment.
"Tony Ashton," she said.

"Is that the man who's been lecturing on French poetry at Mortimer
House?" chimed in Mrs Aislabie. "I longed to go to those lectures.
I heard they were wonderfully interesting."

"Mildred went," said Mrs Treyer.

"Why should we all stand?" said Kitty. She made a movement with
her hands towards the seats. She did things like that so abruptly
that they called her, behind her back, "The Grenadier." They all
moved this way and that, and she herself, after seeing how the
couples sorted themselves, sat down by old Aunt Warburton, who was
enthroned in the great chair.

"Tell me about my delightful godson," the old lady began. She
meant Kitty's second son, who was with the fleet at Malta.

"He's at Malta - " she began. She sat down on a low chair and began
answering her questions. But the fire was too hot for Aunt
Warburton. She raised her knobbed old hand.

"Priestley wants to roast us all alive," said Kitty. She got up
and went to the window. The ladies smiled as she strode across the
room and jerked up the top of the long window. Just for a moment,
as the curtains hung apart, she looked at the square outside.
There was a spatter of leaf-shadow and lamplight on the pavement;
the usual policeman was balancing himself as he patrolled; the
usual little men and women, foreshortened from this height, hurried
along by the railings. So she saw them hurrying, the other way,
when she brushed her teeth in the morning. Then she came back and
sat down on a low stool beside old Aunt Warburton. The worldly old
woman was honest, in her way.

"And the little red-haired ruffian whom I love?" she asked. He was
her favourite; the little boy at Eton.

"He's been in trouble," said Kitty. "He's been swished." She
smiled. He was her favourite too.

The old lady grinned. She liked boys who got into trouble. She
had a wedge-shaped yellow face with an occasional bristle on her
chin; she was over eighty; but she sat as if she were riding a
hunter, Kitty thought, glancing at her hands. They were coarse
hands, with big finger-joints; red and white sparks flashed from
her rings as she moved them.

"And you, my dear," said the old lady, looking at her shrewdly
under her bushy eyebrows, "busy as usual?"

"Yes. Much as usual," said Kitty, evading the shrewd old eyes; for
she did things on the sly that they - the ladies over there - did not
approve.

They were chattering together. Yet animated as it sounded, to
Kitty's ear the talk lacked substance. It was a battledore and
shuttlecock talk, to be kept going until the door opened and the
gentlemen came in. Then it would stop. They were talking about a
by-election. She could hear Lady Margaret telling some story that
was rather coarse presumably, in the eighteenth-century way, since
she dropped her voice.

" - turned her upside down and slapped her," she could hear her say.
There was a twitter of laughter.

"I'm so delighted he got in in spite of them," said Mrs Treyer.
They dropped their voices.

"I'm a tiresome old woman," said Aunt Warburton, raising one of her
knobbed hands to her shoulder. "But now I'm going to ask you to
shut that window." The draught was getting at her rheumatic joint.

Kitty strode to the window. "Damn these women!" she said to
herself. She laid hold of the long stick with a beak at the end
that stood in the window and poked; but the window stuck. She
would have liked to fleece them of their clothes, of their jewels,
of their intrigues, of their gossip. The window went up with a
jerk. There was Ann standing about with nobody to talk to.

"Come and talk to us, Ann," she said, beckoning to her. Ann drew
up a footstool and sat down at Aunt Warburton's feet. There was a
pause. Old Aunt Warburton disliked young girls; but they had
relations in common.

"Where's Timmy, Ann?" she asked.

"Harrow," said Ann.

"Ah, you've  always been to Harrow," said Aunt Warburton. And then
the old lady, with the beautiful breeding that simulated at least
human charity, flattered the girl, likening her to her grandmother,
a famous beauty.

"How I should love to have known her!" Ann exclaimed. "Do tell me - 
what was she like?"

The old lady began making a selection from her memoirs; it was only
a selection; an edition with asterisks; for it was a story that
could hardly be told to a girl in white satin. Kitty's mind
wandered. If Charles stayed much longer downstairs, she thought,
glancing at the clock, she would miss her train. Could Priestley
be trusted to whisper a message in his ears? She would give them
another ten minutes; she turned to Aunt Warburton again.

"She must have been wonderful!" Ann was saying. She sat with her
hands clasped round her knees looking up into the face of the hairy
old dowager. Kitty felt a moment's pity. Her face will be like
their faces, she thought, looking at the little group at the other
side of the room. Their faces looked harassed, worried; their
hands moved restlessly. Yet they're brave, she thought; and
generous. They gave as much as they took. Had Eleanor after all
any right to despise them? Had she done more with her life than
Margaret Marrable? And I? she thought. And I? . . . Who's right?
she thought. Who's wrong? . . . Here mercifully the door opened.

The gentlemen came in. They came in reluctantly, rather slowly, as
if they had just stopped talking, and had to get their bearings in
the drawing-room. They were a little flushed and still laughing,
as if they had stopped in the middle of what they were saying.
They filed in; and the distinguished old man moved across the room
with the air of a ship making port, and all the ladies stirred
without rising. The game was over; the battledores and shuttlecocks
put away. They were like gulls settling on fish, Kitty thought.
There was a rising and a fluttering. The great man let himself
slowly down into a chair beside his old friend Lady Warburton. He
put the tips of his fingers together and began "Well . . . ?" as if
he were continuing a conversation left unfinished the night before.
Yes, she thought, there was something - was it human? civilised? she
could not find the word she wanted - about the old couple, talking,
as they had talked for the past fifty years. . . . They were all
talking. They had all settled in to add another sentence to the
story that was just ending, or in the middle, or about to begin.

But there was Tony Ashton standing by himself without a sentence to
add to the story. She went up to him therefore.

"Have you seen Edward lately?" he asked her as usual.

"Yes, today," she said. "I lunched with him. We walked in the
Park. . . ." She stopped. They had walked in the Park. A thrush
had been singing; they had stopped to listen. "That's the wise
thrush that sings each song twice over . . ." he had said. "Does
he?" she had asked innocently. And it had been a quotation.

She had felt foolish; Oxford always made her feel foolish. She
disliked Oxford; yet she respected Edward and Tony too, she thought
looking at him. A snob on the surface; underneath a scholar. . . .
They had a standard. . . . But she roused herself.

He would like to talk to some smart woman - Mrs Aislabie, or
Margaret Marrable. But they were both engaged - both were adding
sentences with considerable vivacity. There was a pause. She was
not a good hostess, she reflected; this sort of hitch always
happened at her parties. There was Ann; Ann about to be captured
by a youth she knew. But Kitty beckoned. Ann came instantly and
submissively.

"Come and be introduced," she said, "to Mr Ashton. He's been
lecturing at Mortimer House," she explained, "about - " She
hesitated.

"Mallarmé," he said with his odd little squeak, as if his voice had
been pinched off.



Kitty turned away. Martin came up to her.

"A very brilliant party, Lady Lasswade," he said with his usual
tiresome irony.

"This? Oh, not at all," she said brusquely. This wasn't  a party.
Her parties were never brilliant. Martin was trying to tease her
as usual. She looked down and saw his shabby shoes.

"Come and talk to me," she said, feeling the old family affection
return. She noticed with amusement that he was a little flushed, a
little, as the nurses used to say, "above himself". How many
"parties" would it need, she wondered, to turn her satirical,
uncompromising cousin into an obedient member of society?

"Let's sit down and talk sense," she said, sinking on to a little
sofa. He sat down beside her.

"Tell me, what's Nell doing?" she asked.

"She sent her love," said Martin. "She told me to say how much she
wanted to see you."

"Then why wouldn't  she come tonight?" said Kitty. She felt hurt.
She could not help it.

"She hasn't  the right kind of hairpin," he said with a laugh,
looking down at his shoes. Kitty looked down at them too.

"My shoes, you see, don't  matter," he said. "But then I'm a man."

"It's such nonsense . . ." Kitty began. "What does it matter . . ."

But he was looking round him at the groups of beautifully dressed
women; then at the picture.

"That's a horrid daub of you over the mantelpiece," he said,
looking at the red-haired girl. "Who did it?"

"I forget . . . Don't  let's look at it," she said.

"Let's talk . . ." Then she stopped.

He was looking round the room. It was crowded; there were little
tables with photographs; ornate cabinets with vases of flowers; and
panels of yellow brocade let into the walls. She felt that he was
criticising the room and herself too.

"I always want to take a knife and scrape it all off," she said.
But what's the use, she thought? If she moved a picture, "Where's
Uncle Bill on the old cob?" her husband would say, and back it had
to go again.

"Like a hotel, isn't  it?" she continued.

"A saloon," he remarked. He did not know why he always wanted to
hurt her; but he did; it was a fact.

"I was asking myself," he dropped his voice, "Why have a picture
like that" - he nodded his head at the portrait - "when they've  a
Gainsborough . . ."

"And why," she dropped her voice, imitating his tone that was half
sneering, half humorous, "come and eat their food when you despise
them?"

"I don't ! Not a bit!" he exclaimed. "I'm enjoying myself
immensely. I like seeing you, Kitty," he added. It was true - he
always liked her. "You haven't  dropped your poor relations.
That's very nice of you."

"It's they who've  dropped me," she said.

"Oh, Eleanor," he said. "She's a queer old bird."

"It's all so . . ." Kitty began. But there was something wrong
about the disposition of her party; she stopped in the middle of
her sentence. "You've  got to come and talk to Mrs Treyer," she
said getting up.

Why does one do it? he wondered as he followed her. He had wanted
to talk to Kitty; he had nothing to say to that Oriental-looking
harpy with a pheasant's feather floating at the back of her head.
Still, if you drink the good wine of the noble countess, he said
bowing, you have to entertain her less desirable friends. He led
her off.

Kitty went back to the fireplace. She dealt the coal a blow, and
the sparks went volleying up the chimney. She was irritable; she
was restless. Time was passing; if they stayed much longer she
would miss her train. Surreptitiously she noted that the hands of
the clock were close on eleven. The party was bound to break up
soon; it was only the prelude to another party. Yet they were all
talking, and talking, as if they would never go.

She glanced at the groups that seemed immovable. Then the clock
chimed a succession of petulant little strokes, on the last of
which the door opened and Priestley advanced. With his inscrutable
butler's eyes and crooked forefinger he summoned Ann Hillier.

"That's Mama fetching me," said Ann, advancing down the room with a
little flutter.

"She's taking you on?" said Kitty. She held her hand for a moment.
Why? she asked herself, looking at the lovely face, empty of
meaning, or character, like a page on which nothing has been
written but youth. She held her hand for a moment.

"Must you go?" she said.

"I'm afraid I must," said Ann, withdrawing her hand.

There was a general rising and movement, like the flutter of white-
winged gulls.

"Coming with us?" Martin heard Ann say to the youth through whose
hair the rake seemed to have been passed. They turned to leave
together. As she passed Martin, who stood with his hand out, Ann
gave him the least bend of her head, as if his image had been
already swept from her mind. He was dashed; his feeling was out of
all proportion to its object. He felt a strong desire to go with
them, wherever it was. But he had not been asked; Ashton had; he
was following in their wake.

"What a toady!" he thought to himself with a bitterness that
surprised him. It was odd how jealous he felt for a moment. They
were all "going on," it seemed. He hung about a little awkwardly.
Only the old fogies were left - no, even the great man was going on,
it seemed. Only the old lady was left. She was hobbling across
the room on Lasswade's arm. She wanted to confirm something that
she had been saying about a miniature. Lasswade had taken it off
the wall; he held it under a lamp so that she could pronounce her
verdict. Was it Grandpapa on the cob, or was it Uncle William?

"Sit down, Martin, and let us talk," said Kitty. He sat down: but
he had a feeling that she wanted him to go. He had seen her glance
at the clock. They chatted for a moment. Now the old lady came
back; she was proving, beyond a doubt, from her unexampled store of
anecdotes, that it must be Uncle William on the cob; not Grandpapa.
She was going. But she took her time. Martin waited till she was
fairly in the doorway, leaning on her nephew's arm. He hesitated;
they were alone now; should he stay, or should he go? But Kitty
was standing up. She was holding out her hand.

"Come again soon and see me alone," she said. She had dismissed
him, he felt.

That's what people always say, he said to himself as he made his
way slowly downstairs behind Lady Warburton. Come again: but I
don't  know that I shall. . . . Lady Warburton went downstairs like
a crab, holding on to the banisters with one hand, to Lasswade's
arm with the other. He lingered behind her. He looked at the
Canaletto once more. A nice picture: but a copy, he said to
himself. He peered over the banisters and saw the black-and-white
slabs on the hall beneath.

It did work, he said to himself, descending step by step into the
hall. Off and on; by fits and starts. But was it worth it? he
asked himself, letting the footman help him into his coat. The
double doors stood wide open into the street. One or two people
were passing; they peered in curiously, looking at the footmen, at
the bright big hall; and at the old lady who paused for a moment on
the black-and-white squares. She was robing herself. Now she was
accepting her cloak with a violet slash in it; now her furs. A bag
dangled from her wrist. She was hung about with chains; her
fingers were knobbed with rings. Her sharp stone-coloured face,
riddled with lines and wrinkled into creases, looked out from its
soft nest of fur and laces. The eyes were still bright.

The nineteenth century going to bed, Martin said to himself as he
watched her hobble down the steps on the arm of her footman. She
was helped into her carriage. Then he shook hands with that good
fellow his host, who had had quite as much wine as was good for
him, and walked off through Grosvenor Square.



Upstairs in the bedroom at the top of the house Kitty's maid Baxter
was looking out of the window, watching the guests drive off.
There - that was the old lady going. She wished they would hurry;
if the party went on much longer her own little jaunt would be done
for. She was going up the river tomorrow with her young man. She
turned and looked round her. She had everything ready - her
ladyship's coat, skirt, and the bag with the ticket in it. It was
long past eleven. She stood at the dressing-table waiting. The
three-folded mirror reflected silver pots, powder puffs, combs and
brushes. Baxter stooped down and smirked at herself in the glass - 
that was how she would look when she went up the river - then she
drew herself up; she heard footsteps in the passage. Her ladyship
was coming. Here she was.

Lady Lasswade came in, slipping the rings from her fingers. "Sorry
to be so late, Baxter," she said. "Now I must hurry."

Baxter, without speaking, unhooked her dress; slipped it
dexterously to her feet, and bore it away. Kitty sat down at her
dressing-table and kicked off her shoes. Satin shoes were always
too tight. She glanced at the clock on her dressing-table. She
just had time.

Baxter was handing her coat. Now she was handing her bag.

"The ticket's in there, m'lady," she said, touching the bag.

"Now my hat," said Kitty. She stooped to settle it in front of the
mirror. The little tweed travelling-hat poised on the top of her
hair made her look quite a different person; the person she liked
being. She stood in her travelling-dress, wondering if she had
forgotten anything. Her mind was a perfect blank for a moment.
Where am I? she wondered. What am I doing? Where am I going? Her
eyes fixed themselves on the dressing-table; vaguely she remembered
some other room, and some other time when she was a girl. At
Oxford was it?

"The ticket, Baxter?" she said perfunctorily.

"In your bag, m'lady," Baxter reminded her. She was holding it in
her hand.

"So that's everything," said Kitty, glancing round her.

She felt a moment's compunction.

"Thanks, Baxter," she said. "I hope you'll enjoy your. . ." - she
hesitated: she did not know what Baxter did on her day off - ". . .
your play," she said at a venture. Baxter gave a queer little
bitten-off smile. Maids bothered Kitty with their demure
politeness; with their inscrutable, pursed-up faces. But they were
very useful.

"Good-night!" she said to Baxter at the door of the bedroom; for
there Baxter turned back as if her responsibility for her mistress
ended. Somebody else had charge of the stairs.

Kitty looked in at the drawing-room, in case her husband should be
there. But the room was empty. The fire was still blazing; the
chairs, drawn out in a circle, still seemed to hold the skeleton of
the party in their empty arms. But the car was waiting for her at
the door.

"Plenty of time?" she said to the chauffeur as he laid the rug
across her knees. Off they started.



It was a clear still night and every tree in the square was
visible; some were black, others were sprinkled with strange
patches of green artificial light. Above the arc lamps rose shafts
of darkness. Although it was close on midnight, it scarcely seemed
to be night; but rather some ethereal disembodied day, for there
were so many lamps in the streets; cars passing; men in white
mufflers with their light overcoats open walking along the clean
dry pavements, and many houses were still lit up, for everyone was
giving parties. The town changed as they drew smoothly through
Mayfair. The public houses were closing; here was a group
clustered round a lamp-post at the corner. A drunken man was
bawling out some loud song; a tipsy girl with a feather bobbing in
her eyes was swaying as she clung to the lamp-post . . . but
Kitty's eyes alone registered what she saw. After the talk, the
effort and the hurry, she could add nothing to what she saw. And
they swept on quickly. Now they had turned, and the car was
gliding at full speed up a long bright avenue of great shuttered
shops. The streets were almost empty. The yellow station clock
showed that they had five minutes to spare.

Just in time, she said to herself. The usual exhilaration mounted
in her as she walked along the platform. Diffused light poured
down from a great height. Men's cries and the clangour of shunting
carriages echoed in the immense vacancy. The train was waiting;
travellers were making ready to start. Some were standing with one
foot on the step of the carriage drinking out of thick cups as if
they were afraid to go far from their seats. She looked down the
length of the train and saw the engine sucking water from a hose.
It seemed all body, all muscle; even the neck had been consumed
into the smooth barrel of the body. This was "the" train; the
others were toys in comparison. She snuffed up the sulphurous air,
which left a slight tinge of acid at the back of the throat, as if
it already had a tang of the north.

The guard had seen her and was coming towards her with his whistle
in his hand.

"Good evening, m'lady," he said.

"Good evening, Purvis. Run it rather fine," she said as he
unlocked the door of her carriage.

"Yes, m'lady. Only just in time," he replied.

He locked the door. Kitty turned and looked round the small
lighted room in which she was to spend the night. Everything was
ready; the bed was made; the sheets were turned down; her bag was
on the seat. The guard passed the window, holding his flag in his
hand.

A man who had only just caught the train ran across the platform
with his arms spread out. A door slammed.

"Just in time," Kitty said to herself as she stood there. Then the
train gave a gentle tug. She could hardly believe that so great a
monster could start so gently on so long a journey. Then she saw
the tea-urn sliding past.

"We're off," she said to herself, sinking back onto the seat.
"We're off!"

All the tension went out of her body. She was alone; and the train
was moving. The last lamp on the platform slid away. The last
figure on the platform vanished.

"What fun!" she said to herself, as if she were a little girl who
had run away from her nurse and escaped. "We're off!"



She sat still for a moment in her brightly lit compartment; then
she tugged the blind and it sprang up with a jerk. Elongated
lights slid past; lights in factories and warehouses; lights in
obscure back streets. Then there were asphalt paths; more lights
in public gardens; and then bushes and a hedge in a field. They
were leaving London behind them; leaving that blaze of light which
seemed, as the train rushed into the darkness, to contract itself
into one fiery circle. The train rushed with a roar through a
tunnel. It seemed to perform an act of amputation; now she was cut
off from that circle of light.

She looked round the narrow little compartment in which she was
isolated. Everything shook slightly. There was a perpetual faint
vibration. She seemed to be passing from one world to another;
this was the moment of transition. She sat still for a moment;
then undressed and paused with her hand on the blind. The train
had got into its stride now; it was rushing at full speed through
the country. A few distant lights twinkled here and there. Black
clumps of trees stood in the grey summer fields; the fields were
full of summer grasses. The light from the engine lit up a quiet
group of cows; and a hedge of hawthorn. They were in open country
now.

She pulled down the blind and climbed into her bed. She laid
herself out on the rather hard shelf with her back to the carriage
wall, so that she felt a faint vibration against her head. She lay
listening to the humming noise which the train made, now that it
had got into its stride. Smoothly and powerfully she was being
drawn through England to the north. I need do nothing, she
thought, nothing, nothing, but let myself be drawn on. She turned
and pulled the blue shade over the lamp. The sound of the train
became louder in the darkness; its roar, its vibration, seemed to
fall into a regular rhythm of sound, raking through her mind,
rolling out her thoughts.

Ah, but not all of them, she thought, turning restlessly on her
shelf. Some still jutted up. One's not a child, she thought,
staring at the light under the blue shade, any longer. The years
changed things; destroyed things; heaped things up - worries and
bothers; here they were again. Fragments of talk kept coming back
to her; sights came before her. She saw herself raise the window
with a jerk; and the bristles on Aunt Warburton's chin. She saw
the women rising, and the men filing in. She sighed as she turned
on her ledge. All their clothes are the same, she thought; all
their lives are the same. And which is right? she thought, turning
restlessly on her shelf. Which is wrong? She turned again.

The train rushed her on. The sound had deepened; it had become a
continuous roar. How could she sleep? How could she prevent
herself from thinking? She turned away from the light. NOW where
are we? she said to herself. Where is the train at this moment?
NOW, she murmured, shutting her eyes, we are passing the white
house on the hill; NOW we are going through the tunnel; NOW we are
crossing the bridge over the river. . . . A blank intervened; her
thoughts became spaced; they became muddled. Past and present
became jumbled together. She saw Margaret Marrable pinching the
dress in her fingers, but she was leading a bull with a ring
through its nose. . . . This is sleep, she said to herself, half
opening her eyes; thank goodness, she said to herself, shutting
them again, this is sleep. And she resigned herself to the charge
of the train, whose roar now became dulled and distant.



There was a tap at her door. She lay for a moment, wondering why
the room shook so; then the scene settled itself; she was in the
train; she was in the country; they were nearing the station. She
got up.

She dressed rapidly and stood in the corridor. It was still early.
She watched the fields galloping past. They were the bare fields,
the angular fields of the north. The spring was late here; the
trees were not fully out yet. The smoke looped down and caught a
tree in its white cloud. When it lifted, she thought how fine the
light was; clear and sharp, white and grey. The land had none of
the softness, none of the greenness of the land in the south. But
here was the junction; here was the gasometer; they were running
into the station. The train slowed down, and all the lamp-posts on
the platform gradually came to a standstill.

She got out and drew in a deep breath of the cold raw air. The car
was waiting for her; and directly she saw it she remembered - it was
the new car; a birthday present from her husband. She had never
driven in it yet. Cole touched his hat.

"Let's have it open, Cole," she said, and he opened the stiff new
hood, and she got in beside him. Very slowly, for the engine
seemed to beat intermittently, starting and stopping and then
starting again, they moved off. They drove through the town; all
the shops were still shut; women were on their knees scrubbing
doorsteps; blinds were still drawn in bedrooms and sitting-rooms;
there was very little traffic about. Only milk-carts rattled past.
Dogs roamed down the middle of the street on private errands of
their own. Cole had to hoot again and again.

"They'll learn in time, m'lady," he said as a great brindled cur
slunk out of their way. In the town he drove carefully; but once
they were outside he speeded up. Kitty watched the needle jump
forward on the speedometer.

"She does it easily?" she asked, listening to the soft purr of the
engine.

Cole lifted his foot to show how lightly it touched the
accelerator. Then he touched it again and the car sped on. They
were driving too fast, Kitty thought; but the road - she kept her
eye on it - was still empty. Only two or three lumbering farm
waggons passed them; the men went to the horses' heads and held
them as they went by. The road stretched pearl-white in front of
them; the hedges were decked with the little pointed leaves of
early spring.

"Spring's very late up here," said Kitty; "cold winds I suppose?"

Cole nodded. He had none of the servile ways of the London
flunkey; she was at her ease with him; she could be silent. The
air seemed to have different grades of warmth and chill in it; now
sweet; now - they were passing a farmyard - strong-smelling, acrid
from the sour smell of manure. She leant back, holding her hat to
her head as they rushed a hill. "You won't  get her up this on top,
Cole," she said. The pace slackened a little; they were climbing
the familiar Crabbs hill, with the yellow streaks where carters had
put on their brakes. In the old days, when she drove horses, they
used to get out here and walk. Cole said nothing. He was going to
show off his engine, she suspected. The car swept up finely. But
the hill was long; there was a level stretch; then the road mounted
again. The car faltered. Cole coaxed her on. Kitty saw him jerk
his body slightly backwards and forwards as if he were encouraging
horses. She felt the tension of his muscles. They slowed - they
almost stopped. No, now they were on the crest of the hill. She
had done it on top!

"Well done!" she exclaimed. He said nothing; but he was very
proud, she knew.

"We couldn't  have done that on the old car," she said.

"Ah, but it wasn't  her fault," said Cole.

He was a very humane man; the kind of man she liked, she reflected - 
silent, reserved. On they swept again. Now they were passing the
grey stone house where the mad lady lived alone with her peacocks
and her bloodhounds. They had passed it. Now the woods were on
their right hand and the air came singing through them. It was
like the sea, Kitty thought, looking, as they passed, down a dark
green drive patched with yellow sunlight. On they went again. Now
heaps of ruddy brown leaves lay by the roadside staining the
puddles red.

"It's been raining?" she said. He nodded. They came out on the
high ridge with woods beneath and there, in a clearing among the
trees, was the grey tower of the Castle. She always looked for it
and greeted it as if she were raising a hand to a friend. They
were on their own land now. Gateposts were branded with their
initials; their arms swung above the doorways of inns; their crest
was mounted over cottage doors. Cole looked at the clock. The
needle leapt again.

Too fast, too fast! Kitty said to herself. But she liked the rush
of the wind in her face. Now they reached the Lodge gate; Mrs
Preedy was holding it open with a white-haired child on her arm.
They rushed through the Park. The deer looked up and hopped away
lightly through the fern.

"Two minutes under the quarter, m'lady," said Cole as they swept in
a circle and drew up at the door. Kitty stood for a moment looking
at the car. She laid her hand on the bonnet. It was hot. She
gave it a little pat. "She did it beautifully, Cole," she said.
"I'll tell his Lordship." Cole smiled; he was happy.

She went in. Nobody was about; they had arrived earlier than was
expected. She crossed the great stone-flagged hall, with the
armour and the busts, and went into the morning-room where
breakfast was laid.

The green light dazzled her as she went in. It was as if she stood
in the hollow of an emerald. All was green outside. The statues
of grey French ladies stood on the terrace, holding their baskets;
but the baskets were empty. In summer flowers would burn there.
Green turf fell down in broad swaths between clipped yews; dipped
to the river; and then rose again to the hill that was crested with
woods. There was a curl of mist on the woods now - the light mist
of early morning. As she gazed a bee buzzed in her ear; she
thought she heard the murmur of the river over the stones; pigeons
crooned in the tree tops. It was the voice of early morning, the
voice of summer. But the door opened. Here was breakfast.

She breakfasted; she felt warm, stored, and comfortable as she lay
back in her chair. And she had nothing to do - nothing whatever.
The whole day was hers. It was fine too. The sunlight suddenly
quickened in the room, and laid a broad bar of light across the
floor. The sun was on the flowers outside. A tortoiseshell
butterfly flaunted across the window; she saw it settle on a leaf,
and there it sat, opening its wings and shutting them, opening and
shutting them, as if it feasted on the sunlight. She watched it.
The down was soft rust-red on its wings. Off it flaunted again.
Then, admitted by an invisible hand, the chow stalked in; came
straight up to her; sniffed at her skirt, and flung himself down in
a bright patch of sunlight.

Heartless brute! she thought, but his indifference pleased her. He
asked nothing of her either. She stretched her hand for a
cigarette. And what would Martin say, she wondered, as she took
the enamel box that turned from green to blue, as she opened it.
Hideous? Vulgar? Possibly - but what did it matter what people
said? Criticism seemed light as smoke this morning. What did it
matter what he said, what they said, what anybody said, since she
had a whole day to herself? - since she was alone? And there they
are, still asleep, in their houses, she thought, standing at the
window, looking at the green-grey grass, after their dances, after
their parties . . . The thought pleased her. She threw away her
cigarette and went upstairs to change her clothes.

The sun was much stronger when she came down again. The garden had
already lost its look of purity; the mist was off the woods. She
could hear the squeak of the lawn mower as she stepped out of the
window. The rubber-shoed pony was pacing up and down the lawns
leaving a pale wake in the grass behind him. The birds were
singing in their scattered way. The starlings in their bright mail
were feeding on the grass. Dew shone, red, violet, gold on the
trembling tips of the grass blades. It was a perfect May morning.

She sauntered slowly along the terrace. As she passed she glanced
in at the long windows of the library. Everything was shrouded and
shut up. But the long room looked more than usually stately, its
proportions seemly; and the brown books in their long rows seemed
to exist silently, with dignity, by themselves, for themselves.
She left the terrace and strolled down the long grass path. The
garden was still empty; only a man in his shirt sleeves was doing
something to a tree; but she need speak to nobody. The chow
stalked after her; he too was silent. She walked on past the
flower-beds to the river. There she always stopped, on the bridge,
with the cannon-balls at intervals. The water always fascinated
her. The quick northern river came down from the moors; it was
never smooth and green, never deep and placid like southern rivers.
It raced; it hurried. It splayed itself, red, yellow and clear
brown, over the pebbles on the bed. Resting her elbows on the
balustrade, she watched it eddy round the arches; she watched it
make diamonds and sharp arrow streaks over the stones. She
listened. She knew the different sounds it made in summer and
winter; now it hurried, it raced.

But the chow was bored; he marched on. She followed him. She went
up the green ride towards the snuffer-shaped monument on the crest
of the hill. Every path through the woods had its name. There was
Keepers' Path, Lovers' Walk, Ladies' Mile, and here was the Earl's
Ride. But before she went into the woods, she stopped and looked
back at the house. Times out of number she had stopped here; the
Castle looked grey and stately; asleep this morning, with the
blinds drawn, and no flag on the flagstaff. Very noble it looked,
and ancient, and enduring. Then she went on into the woods.

The wind seemed to rise as she walked under the trees. It sang in
their tops, but it was silent beneath. The dead leaves crackled
under foot; among them sprang up the pale spring flowers, the
loveliest of the year - blue flowers and white flowers, trembling on
cushions of green moss. Spring was sad always, she thought; it
brought back memories. All passes, all changes, she thought, as
she climbed up the little path between the trees. Nothing of this
belonged to her; her son would inherit; his wife would walk here
after her. She broke off a twig; she picked a flower and put it to
her lips. But she was in the prime of life; she was vigorous. She
strode on. The ground rose sharply; her muscles felt strong and
flexible as she pressed her thick-soled shoes to the ground. She
threw away her flower. The trees thinned as she strode higher and
higher. Suddenly she saw the sky between two striped tree trunks
extraordinarily blue. She came out on the top. The wind ceased;
the country spread wide all round her. Her body seemed to shrink;
her eyes to widen. She threw herself on the ground, and looked
over the billowing land that went rising and falling, away and
away, until somewhere far off it reached the sea. Uncultivated,
uninhabited, existing by itself, for itself, without towns or
houses it looked from this height. Dark wedges of shadow, bright
breadths of light lay side by side. Then, as she watched, light
moved and dark moved; light and shadow went travelling over the
hills and over the valleys. A deep murmur sang in her ears - the
land itself, singing to itself, a chorus, alone. She lay there
listening. She was happy, completely. Time had ceased.



1917


A very cold winter's night, so silent that the air seemed frozen,
and, since there was no moon, congealed to the stillness of glass
spread over England. Ponds and ditches were frozen; the puddles
made glazed eyes in the roads, and on the pavement the frost had
raised slippery knobs. Darkness pressed on the windows; towns had
merged themselves in open country. No light shone, save when a
searchlight rayed round the sky, and stopped, here and there, as if
to ponder some fleecy patch.



"If that is the river," said Eleanor, pausing in the dark street
outside the station, "Westminster must be there." The omnibus in
which she had come, with its silent passengers looking cadaverous
in the blue light, had already vanished. She turned.

She was dining with Renny and Maggie, who lived in one of the
obscure little streets under the shadow of the Abbey. She walked
on. The further side of the street was almost invisible. The
lamps were shrouded in blue. She flashed her torch onto a name on
a street corner. Again she flashed her torch. Here it lit up a
brick wall; there a dark green tuft of ivy. At last the number
thirty, the number she was looking for, shone out. She knocked and
rang at the same moment, for the darkness seemed to muffle sound as
well as sight. Silence weighed on her as she stood there waiting.
Then the door opened and a man's voice said, "Come in!"

He shut the door behind him, quickly, as if to shut out the light.
It looked strange after the streets - the perambulator in the hall;
the umbrellas in the stand; the carpet, the pictures: they all
seemed intensified.

"Come in!" said Renny again, and led her into the sitting-room
ablaze with light. Another man was standing in the room, and she
was surprised because she had expected to find them alone. But the
man was somebody whom she did not know.

For a moment they stared at each other; then Renny said, "You know
Nicholas . . ." but he did not speak the surname distinctly, and it
was so long that she could not catch it. A foreign name, she
thought. A foreigner. He was clearly not English. He shook hands
with a bow like a foreigner, and he went on talking, as if he were
in the middle of a sentence that he wished to finish . . . "we are
talking about Napoleon - " he said, turning to her.

"I see," she said. But she had no notion what he was saying. They
were in the middle of an argument, she supposed. But it came to an
end without her understanding a word of it, except that it had to
do with Napoleon. She took off her coat and laid it down. They
stopped talking.

"I will go and tell Maggie," said Renny. He left them abruptly.

"You were talking about Napoleon?" Eleanor said. She looked at the
man whose surname she had not heard. He was very dark; he had a
rounded head and dark eyes. Did she like him or not? She did not
know.

I've  interrupted them, she felt, and I've  nothing whatever to say.
She felt dazed and cold. She spread her hands over the fire. It
was a real fire; wood blocks were blazing; the flame ran along the
streaks of shiny tar. A little trickle of feeble gas was all that
was left her at home.

"Napoleon," she said, warming her hands. She spoke without any
meaning.

"We were considering the psychology of great men," he said, "by the
light of modern science," he added with a little laugh. She wished
the argument had been more within her reach.

"That's very interesting," she said shyly.

"Yes - if we knew anything about it," he said.

"If we knew anything about it . . ." she repeated. There was a
pause. She felt numb all over - not only her hands, but her brain.

"The psychology of great men - " she said, for she did not wish him
to think her a fool, ". . . was that what you were discussing?"

"We were saying - " He paused. She guessed that he found it
difficult to sum up their argument - they had evidently been talking
for some time, judging by the newspapers lying about and the
cigarette-ends on the table.

"I was saying," he went on, "I was saying we do not know ourselves,
ordinary people; and if we do not know ourselves, how then can we
make religions, laws, that - " he used his hands as people do who
find language obdurate, "that - "

"That fit - that fit," she said, supplying him with a word that was
shorter, she felt sure, than the dictionary word that foreigners
always used.

" - that fit, that fit," he said, taking the word and repeating it
as if he were grateful for her help.

". . . that fit," she repeated. She had no idea what they were
talking about. Then suddenly, as she bent to warm her hands over
the fire words floated together in her mind and made one
intelligible sentence. It seemed to her that what he had said was,
"We cannot make laws and religions that fit because we do not know
ourselves."

"How odd that you should say that!" she said, smiling at him,
"because I've  so often thought it myself!"

"Why is that odd?" he said. "We all think the same things; only we
do not say them."

"Coming along in the omnibus tonight," she began, "I was thinking
about this war - I don't  feel this, but other people do . . ." She
stopped. He looked puzzled; probably she had misunderstood what he
had said; she had not made her own meaning plain.

"I mean," she began again, "I was thinking as I came along in the
bus - "

But here Renny came in.

He was carrying a tray with bottles and glasses.

"It is a great thing," said Nicholas, "being the son of a wine
merchant."

It sounded like a quotation from the French grammar.

The son of the wine merchant, Eleanor repeated to herself, looking
at his red cheeks, dark eyes and large nose. The other man must be
Russian, she thought. Russian, Polish, Jewish? - she had no idea
what he was, who he was.

She drank; the wine seemed to caress a knob in her spine. Here
Maggie came in.

"Good evening," she said, disregarding the foreigner's bow as if
she knew him too well to greet him.

"Papers," she protested, looking at the litter on the floor,
"papers, papers." The floor was strewn with papers.

"We dine in the basement," she continued, turning to Eleanor,
"because we've  no servants." She led the way down the steep little
stairs.

"But Magdalena," said Nicholas, as they stood in the little low-
ceilinged room in which dinner was laid, "Sara said, 'We shall meet
tomorrow night at Maggie's . . .' She is not here."

He stood; the others had sat down.

"She will come in time," said Maggie.

"I shall ring her up," said Nicholas. He left the room.

"Isn't  it much nicer," said Eleanor, taking her plate, "not having
servants . . ."

"We have a woman to do the washing-up," said Maggie.

"And we are extremely dirty," said Renny.

He took up a fork and examined it between the prongs.

"No, this fork, as it happens, is clean," he said, and put it down
again.

Nicholas came back into the room. He looked perturbed. "She is
not there," he said to Maggie. "I rang her up, but I could get no
answer."

"Probably she's coming," said Maggie. "Or she may have
forgotten. . . ."

She handed him his soup. But he sat looking at his plate without
moving. Wrinkles had come on his forehead; he made no attempt to
hide his anxiety. He was without self-consciousness. "There!" he
suddenly exclaimed, interrupting them as they talked. "She is
coming!" he added. He put down his spoon and waited. Someone was
coming slowly down the steep stairs.

The door opened and Sara came in. She looked pinched with the
cold. Her cheeks were white here and red there, and she blinked as
if she were still dazed from her walk through the blue-shrouded
streets. She gave her hand to Nicholas and he kissed it. But she
wore no engagement ring, Eleanor observed.

"Yes, we are dirty," said Maggie, looking at her; she was in her
day clothes. "In rags," she added, for a loop of gold thread hung
down from her own sleeve as she helped the soup.

"I was thinking how beautiful . . ." said Eleanor, for her eyes had
been resting on the silver dress with gold threads in it. "Where
did you get it?"

"In Constantinople, from a Turk," said Maggie.

"A turbaned and fantastic Turk," Sara murmured, stroking the sleeve
as she took her plate. She still seemed dazed.

"And the plates," said Eleanor, looking at the purple birds on her
plate, "Don't  I remember them?" she asked.

"In the cabinet in the drawing-room at home," said Maggie. "But it
seemed silly - keeping them in a cabinet."

"We break one every week," said Renny.

"They'll last the war," said Maggie.

Eleanor observed a curious mask-like expression come down over
Renny's face as she said "the war." Like all the French, she
thought, he cares passionately for his country. But contradictorily,
she felt, looking at him. He was silent. His silence oppressed
her. There was something formidable about his silence.

"And why were you so late?" said Nicholas, turning to Sara. He
spoke gently, reproachfully, rather as if she were a child. He
poured her out a glass of wine.

Take care, Eleanor felt inclined to say to her; the wine goes to
one's head. She had not drunk wine for months. She was feeling
already a little blurred; a little light-headed. It was the light
after the dark; talk after silence; the war, perhaps, removing
barriers.

But Sara drank. Then she burst out:

"Because of that damned fool."

"Damned fool?" said Maggie. "Which?"

"Eleanor's nephew," said Sara. "North. Eleanor's nephew, North."
She held her glass towards Eleanor, as if she were addressing her.
"North . . ." Then she smiled. "There I was, sitting alone. The
bell rang. 'That's the wash,' I said. Footsteps came up the
stairs. There was North - North," she raised her hand to her head
as if in salute, "cutting a figure like this - 'What the devil's
that for?' I asked. 'I leave for the Front tonight,' he said,
clicking his heels together. 'I'm a lieutenant in - ' whatever it
was - Royal Regiment of Rat-catchers or something. . . . And he
hung his cap on the bust of our grandfather. And I poured out tea.
'How many lumps of sugar does a lieutenant in the Royal Rat-
catchers require?' I asked. 'One. Two. Three. Four. . . .'"

She dropped pellets of bread on to the table. As each fell, it
seemed to emphasise her bitterness. She looked older, more worn;
though she laughed, she was bitter.

"Who is North?" Nicholas asked. He pronounced the word "North" as
if it were a point on the compass.

"My nephew. My brother Morris's son," Eleanor explained.

"There he sat," Sara resumed, "in his mud-coloured uniform, with
his switch between his legs, and his ears sticking out on either
side of his pink, foolish face, and whatever I said, 'Good,' he
said, 'Good,' 'Good,' until I took up the poker and tongs" - she
took up her knife and fork - "and played 'God save the King, Happy
and Glorious, Long to reign over us - '" She held her knife and
fork as if they were weapons.

I'm sorry he's gone, Eleanor thought. A picture came before her
eyes - the picture of a nice cricketing boy smoking a cigar on a
terrace. I'm sorry. . . . Then another picture formed. She was
sitting on the same terrace; but now the sun was setting; a maid
came out and said, "The soldiers are guarding the line with fixed
bayonets!" That was how she had heard of the war - three years
ago. And she had thought, putting down her coffee-cup on a little
table, Not if I can help it! overcome by an absurd but vehement
desire to protect those hills; she had looked at the hills across
the meadow. . . . Now she looked at the foreigner opposite.

"How unfair you are," Nicholas was saying to Sara. "Prejudiced;
narrow; unfair," he repeated, tapping her hand with his finger.

He was saying what Eleanor felt herself.

"Yes. Isn't  it natural . . ." she began. "Could you allow the
Germans to invade England and do nothing?" she said, turning to
Renny. She was sorry she had spoken; and the words were not the
ones she had meant to use. There was an expression of suffering,
or was it anger? on his face.

"I?" he said. "I help them to make shells."

Maggie stood behind him. She had brought in the meat. "Carve,"
she said. He was staring at the meat which she had put down in
front of him. He took up the knife and began to carve mechanically.

"Now, Nurse," she reminded him. He cut another helping.

"Yes," said Eleanor awkwardly as Maggie took away the plate. She
did not know what to say. She spoke without thinking. "Let's end
it as quickly as possible and then . . ." She looked at him. He
was silent. He turned away. He had turned to listen to what the
others were saying, as if to take refuge from speaking himself.

"Poppycock, poppycock . . . don't  talk such damned poppycock - 
that's what you really said," Nicholas was saying. His hands were
large and clean and the finger-nails were trimmed very close,
Eleanor noticed. He might be a doctor, she thought.

"What's 'poppy-cock'?" she asked, turning to Renny. For she did
not know the word.

"American," said Renny. "He's an American," he said, nodding at
Nicholas.

"No," said Nicholas, turning round, "I am a Pole."

"His mother was a Princess," said Maggie as if she were teasing
him. That explains the seal on his chain, Eleanor thought. He
wore a large old seal on his chain.

"She was," he said quite seriously. "One of the noblest families
in Poland. But my father was an ordinary man - a man of the
people. . . . You should have had more self-control," he added,
turning again to Sara.

"So I should," she sighed. "But then he gave his bridle reins a
shake and said, 'Adieu for evermore, adieu for evermore!'" She
stretched out her hand and poured herself another glass of wine.

"You shall have no more to drink," said Nicholas, moving away the
bottle. "She saw herself," he explained, turning to Eleanor, "on
top of a tower, waving a white handkerchief to a knight in armour."

"And the moon was rising over a dark moor," Sara murmured, touching
a pepper-pot.

The pepper-pot's a dark moor, Eleanor thought, looking at it. A
little blur had come round the edges of things. It was the wine;
it was the war. Things seemed to have lost their skins; to be
freed from some surface hardness; even the chair with gilt claws,
at which she was looking, seemed porous; it seemed to radiate out
some warmth, some glamour, as she looked at it.

"I remember that chair," she said to Maggie. "And your mother . . ."
she added. But she always saw Eugénie not sitting but in
movement.

". . . dancing," she added.

"Dancing . . ." Sara repeated. She began drumming on the table
with her fork.

"When I was young, I used to dance," she hummed.

"All men loved me when I was young. . . . Roses and syringas hung,
when I was young, when I was young. D'you remember, Maggie?" She
looked at her sister as if they both remembered the same thing.

Maggie nodded. "In the bedroom. A waltz," she said.

"A waltz . . ." said Eleanor. Sara was drumming a waltz rhythm on
the table. Eleanor began to hum in time to it: "Hoity te, toity
te, hoity te. . . ."

A long-drawn hollow sound wailed out.

"No, no!" she protested, as if somebody had given her the wrong
note. But the sound wailed again.

"A fog-horn?" she said. "On the river?"

But as she said it she knew what it was.

The siren wailed again.

"The Germans!" said Renny. "Those damned Germans!" He put down
his knife and fork with an exaggerated gesture of boredom.

"Another raid," said Maggie, getting up. She left the room; Renny
followed her.



"The Germans . . ." said Eleanor as the door shut. She felt as if
some dull bore had interrupted an interesting conversation. The
colours began to fade. She had been looking at the red chair. It
lost its radiance as she looked at it, as if a light had been
extinguished underneath.

They heard the rush of wheels in the street. Everything seemed to
be going past very quickly. There was the round of feet tapping on
the pavement. Eleanor got up and drew the curtains slightly apart.
The basement was sunk beneath the pavement, so that she only saw
people's legs and skirts as they went past the area railings. Two
men came by walking very quickly; then an old woman, with her skirt
swinging from side to side, walked past.

"Oughtn't  we to ask people in?" she said, turning round. But when
she looked back the old woman had disappeared. So had the men.
The street was now quite empty. The houses opposite were
completely curtained. She drew their own curtain carefully. The
table, with the gay china and the lamp, seemed ringed in a circle
of bright light as she turned back.

She sat down again. "D'you mind air raids?" Nicholas asked,
looking at her with his inquisitive expression. "People differ so
much."

"Not at all," she said. She would have crumbled a piece of bread
to show him that she was at her ease; but as she was not afraid,
the action seemed to her unnecessary.

"The chances of being hit oneself are so small," she said. "What
were we saying?" she added.

It seemed to her that they had been saying something extremely
interesting; but she could not remember what. They sat silent for
a moment. Then they heard a shuffling on the stairs.

"The children . . ." said Sara. They heard the dull boom of a gun
in the distance.

Here Renny came in.

"Bring your plates," he said.

"In here." He led them into the cellar. It was a large cellar.
With its crypt-like ceiling and stone walls it had a damp
ecclesiastical look. It was used partly for coal, partly for wine.
The light in the centre shone on glittering heaps of coal; bottles
of wine wrapped in straw lay on their sides on stone shelves.
There was a mouldy smell of wine, straw and damp. It was chilly
after the dining-room. Sara came in carrying quilts and dressing-
gowns which she had fetched from upstairs. Eleanor was glad to
wrap herself in a blue dressing-gown; she wrapped it round her and
sat holding her plate on her knees. It was cold.

"And now?" said Sara, holding her spoon erect.

They all looked as if they were waiting for something to happen.
Maggie came in carrying a plum pudding.

"We may as well finish our dinner," she said. But she spoke too
sensibly; she was anxious about the children, Eleanor guessed.
They were in the kitchen. She had seen them as she passed.

"Are they asleep?" she asked.

"Yes. But if the guns . . ." she began, helping the pudding.
Another gun boomed out. This time it was distinctly louder.

"They've  got through the defences," said Nicholas.

They began to eat their pudding.

A gun boomed again. This time there was a bark in its boom.

"Hampstead," said Nicholas. He took out his watch. The silence
was profound. Nothing happened. Eleanor looked at the blocks of
stone arched over their heads. She noticed a spider's web in one
corner. Another gun boomed. A sigh of air rushed up with it. It
was right on top of them this time.

"The Embankment," said Nicholas. Maggie put down her plate and
went into the kitchen.

There was profound silence. Nothing happened. Nicholas looked at
his watch as if he were timing the guns. There was something queer
about him, Eleanor thought; medical, priestly? He wore a seal that
hung down from his watch-chain. The number on the box opposite was
1397. She noticed everything. The Germans must be overhead now.
She felt a curious heaviness on top of her head. One, two, three,
four, she counted, looking up at the greenish-grey stone. Then
there was a violent crack of sound, like the split of lightning in
the sky. The spider's web oscillated.

"On top of us," said Nicholas, looking up. They all looked up. At
any moment a bomb might fall. There was dead silence. In the
silence they heard Maggie's voice in the kitchen.

"That was nothing. Turn round and go to sleep." She spoke very
calmly and soothingly.

One, two, three four, Eleanor counted. The spider's web was
swaying. That stone may fall, she thought, fixing a certain stone
with her eyes. Then a gun boomed again. It was fainter - further
away.

"That's over," said Nicholas. He shut his watch with a click. And
they all turned and shifted on their hard chairs as if they had
been cramped.



Maggie came in.

"Well, that's over," she said.  "He woke for a moment, but he went
off to sleep again," she said in an undertone to Renny, "but the
baby slept right through."  She sat down and took the plate that
Renny was holding for her.

"Now let's finish our pudding," she said, speaking in her natural
voice.

"Now we will have some wine," said Renny. He examined one bottle;
then another; finally he took a third and wiped it carefully with
the tail of his dressing-gown. He placed the bottle on a wooden
case and they sat round in a circle.

"It didn't  come to much, did it?" said Sara. She was tilting back
her chair as she held out her glass.

"Ah, but we were frightened," said Nicholas. "Look - how pale we
all are."

They looked at each other. Draped in their quilts and dressing-
gowns, against the grey-green walls, they all looked whitish,
greenish.

"It's partly the light," said Maggie. "Eleanor," she said, looking
at her, "looks like an abbess."

The deep-blue dressing-gown which hid the foolish little ornaments,
the tabs of velvet and lace on her dress, had improved her
appearance. Her middle-aged face was crinkled like an old glove
that has been creased into a multitude of fine lines by the
gestures of a hand.

"Untidy, am I?" she said, putting her hand to her hair.

"No. Don't  touch it," said Maggie.

"And what were we talking about before the raid?" Eleanor asked.
Again she felt that they had been in the middle of saying something
very interesting when they were interrupted. But there had been a
complete break; none of them could remember what they had been
saying.

"Well, it's over now," said Sara. "So let's drink a health - Here's
to the New World!" she exclaimed. She raised her glass with a
flourish. They all felt a sudden desire to talk and laugh.

"Here's to the New World!" they all cried, raising their glasses,
and clinking them together.

The five glasses filled with yellow liquid came together in a
bunch.

"To the New World!" they cried and drank. The yellow liquid swayed
up and down in their glasses.

"Now, Nicholas," said Sara, setting her glass down with a tap on
the box, "a speech! A speech!"

"Ladies and gentlemen!" he began, flinging his hand out like an
orator. "Ladies and gentlemen . . ."

"We don't  want speeches," Renny interrupted him.

Eleanor was disappointed. She would have liked a speech. But he
seemed to take the interruption good-humouredly; he sat there
nodding and smiling.

"Let's go upstairs," said Renny, pushing away the box.

"And leave this cellar," said Sara, stretching her arms out, "this
cave of mud and dung. . . ."

"Listen!" Maggie interrupted. She held up her hand. "I thought I
heard the guns again. . . ."

They listened. The guns were still firing, but far away in the
distance. There was a sound like the breaking of waves on a shore
far away.

"They're only killing other people," said Renny savagely. He
kicked the wooden box.

"But you must let us think of something else," Eleanor protested.
The mask had come down over his face.

"And what nonsense, what nonsense Renny talks," said Nicholas,
turning to her privately. "Only children letting off fireworks in
the back garden," he muttered as he helped her out of her dressing-
gown. They went upstairs.



Eleanor came into the drawing-room. It looked larger than she
remembered it, and very spacious and comfortable. Papers were
strewn on the floor; the fire was burning brightly; it was warm; it
was cheerful. She felt very tired. She sank down into an
armchair. Sara and Nicholas had lagged behind. The others were
helping the nurse to carry the children up to bed, she supposed.
She lay back in the chair. Everything seemed to become quiet and
natural again. A feeling of great calm possessed her. It was as
if another space of time had been issued to her, but, robbed by the
presence of death of something personal, she felt - she hesitated
for a word; "immune?" Was that what she meant? Immune, she said,
looking at a picture without seeing it. Immune, she repeated. It
was a picture of a hill and a village perhaps in the South of
France; perhaps in Italy. There were olive trees; and white roofs
grouped against a hillside. Immune, she repeated, looking at the
picture.

She could hear a gentle thudding on the floor above; Maggie and
Renny were settling the children into their beds again, she
supposed. There was a little squeak, like a sleepy bird chirping
in its nest. It was very private and peaceful after the guns. But
here the others came in.

"Did they mind it?" she said, sitting up, " - the children?"

"No," said Maggie. "They slept through it."

"But they may have dreamt," said Sara, pulling up a chair. Nobody
spoke. It was very quiet. The clocks that used to boom out the
hour in Westminster were silent.

Maggie took the poker and struck the wood blocks. The sparks went
volleying up the chimney in a shower of gold eyes.

"How that makes me . . ." Eleanor began.

She stopped.

"Yes?" said Nicholas.

". . . think of my childhood," she added.

She was thinking of Morris and herself, and old Pippy; but had she
told them nobody would know what she meant. They were silent.
Suddenly a clear flute-like note rang out in the street below.

"What's that?" said Maggie. She started; she looked at the window;
she half rose.

"The bugles," said Renny, putting out his hand to stop her.

The bugles blew again beneath the window. Then they heard them
further down the street; then further away still down the next
street. Almost directly the hooting of cars began again, and the
rushing of wheels as if the traffic had been released and the usual
night life of London had begun again.

"It's over," said Maggie. She lay back in her chair; she looked
very tired for a moment. Then she pulled a basket towards her and
began to darn a sock.

"I'm glad I'm alive," said Eleanor. "Is that wrong, Renny?" she
asked. She wanted him to speak. It seemed to her that he hoarded
immense supplies of emotion that he could not express. He did not
answer. He was leaning on his elbow, smoking a cigar and looking
into the fire.

"I have spent the evening sitting in a coal cellar while other
people try to kill each other above my head," he said suddenly.
Then he stretched out and took up a paper.

"Renny, Renny, Renny," said Nicholas, as if he were expostulating
with a naughty child. He went on reading. The rush of wheels and
the hooting of motor cars had run themselves into one continuous
sound.

As Renny was reading and Maggie was darning there was silence in
the room. Eleanor watched the fire run along veins of tar and
blaze and sink.

"What are you thinking, Eleanor?" Nicholas interrupted her. He
calls me Eleanor, she thought; that's right.

"About the new world . . ." she said aloud. "D'you think we're
going to improve?" she asked.

"Yes, yes," he said, nodding his head.

He spoke quietly as if he did not wish to rouse Renny who was
reading, or Maggie who was darning, or Sara who was lying back in
her chair half asleep. They seemed to be talking, privately,
together.

"But how. . ." she began, " - how can we improve ourselves . . .
live more. . ." - she dropped her voice as if she were afraid of
waking sleepers - ". . . live more naturally . . . better . . . How
can we?"

"It is only a question," he said - he stopped. He drew himself
close to her - "of learning. The soul . . ." Again he stopped.

"Yes - the soul?" she prompted him.

"The soul - the whole being," he explained. He hollowed his hands
as if to enclose a circle. "It wishes to expand; to adventure; to
form - new combinations?"

"Yes, yes," she said, as if to assure him that his words were
right.

"Whereas now," - he drew himself together; put his feet together; he
looked like an old lady who is afraid of mice - "this is how we
live, screwed up into one hard little, tight little - knot?"

"Knot, knot - yes, that's right," she nodded.

"Each is his own little cubicle; each with his own cross or holy
book; each with his fire, his wife . . ."

"Darning socks," Maggie interrupted.

Eleanor started. She had seemed to be looking into the future.
But they had been overheard. Their privacy was ended.

Renny threw down his paper. "It's all damned rot!" he said.
Whether he referred to the paper, or to what they were saying,
Eleanor did not know. But talk in private was impossible.

"Why d'you buy them then?" she said, pointing to the papers.

"To light fires with," said Renny.

Maggie laughed and threw down the sock she was mending. "There!"
she exclaimed. "Mended. . . ."

Again they sat silent, looking at the fire. Eleanor wished that he
would go on talking - the man she called Nicholas. When, she wanted
to ask him, when will this new world come? When shall we be free?
When shall we live adventurously, wholly, not like cripples in a
cave? He seemed to have released something in her; she felt not
only a new space of time, but new powers, something unknown within
her. She watched his cigarette moving up and down. Then Maggie
took the poker and struck the wood and again a shower of red-eyed
sparks went volleying up the chimney. We shall be free, we shall
be free, Eleanor thought.

"And what have you been thinking all this time?" said Nicholas,
laying his hand on Sara's knee. She started. "Or have you been
asleep?" he added.

"I heard what you were saying," she said.

"What were we saying?" he asked.

"The soul flying upwards like sparks up the chimney," she said.
The sparks were flying up the chimney.

"Not such a bad shot," said Nicholas.

"Because people always say the same thing," she laughed. She
roused herself and sat up. "There's Maggie - she says nothing.
There's Renny - he says 'What damned rot!' Eleanor says 'That's
just what I was thinking.' . . . And Nicholas, Nicholas," - she
patted him on the knee - "who ought to be in prison, says, 'Oh, my
dear friends, let us improve the soul!'"

"Ought to be in prison?" said Eleanor, looking at him.

"Because he loves," Sara explained. She paused. " - the other sex,
the other sex, you see," she said lightly, waving her hand in the
way that was so like her mother's.

For a second a sharp shiver of repugnance passed over Eleanor's
skin as if a knife had sliced it. Then she realised that it
touched nothing of importance. The sharp shiver passed.
Underneath was - what? She looked at Nicholas. He was watching
her.

"Does that," he said, hesitating a little, "make you dislike me,
Eleanor?"

"Not in the least! Not in the least!" she exclaimed spontaneously.
All the evening, off and on, she had been feeling about him; this,
that, and the other; but now all the feelings came together and
made one feeling, one whole - liking. "Not in the least," she said
again. He gave her a little bow. She returned it with a little
bow. But the clock on the mantelpiece was striking. Renny was
yawning. It was late. She got up. She went to the window and
parted the curtains and looked out. All the houses were still
curtained. The cold winter's night was almost black. It was like
looking into the hollow of a dark-blue stone. Here and there a
star pierced the blue. She had a sense of immensity and peace - as
if something had been consumed. . . .

"Shall I get you a cab?" Renny interrupted.

"No, I'll walk," she said, turning. "I like walking in London."

"We will come with you," said Nicholas. "Come, Sara," he said.
She was lying back in her chair swinging her foot up and down.

"But I don't  want to come," she said, waving him away. "I want to
stay; I want to talk; I want to sing - a hymn of praise - a song of
thanksgiving. . . ."

"Here is your hat; here is your bag," said Nicholas, giving them to
her.

"Come," he said, taking her by the shoulder and pushing her out of
the room. "Come."

Eleanor went up to say good-night to Maggie.

"I should like to stay too," she said. "There are so many things I
should like to talk about - "

"But I want to go to bed - I want to go to bed," Renny protested.
He stood there with his hands stretched above his head, yawning.

Maggie rose. "So you shall," she laughed at him.

"Don't  bother to come downstairs," Eleanor protested as he opened
the door for her. But he insisted. He is very rude and at the
same time very polite, she thought, as she followed him down the
stairs. A man who feels many different things, and all
passionately, all at the same time, she thought. . . . But they
had reached the hall. Nicholas and Sara were standing there.

"Cease to laugh at me for once, Sara," Nicholas was saying as he
put on his coat.

"And cease to lecture me," she said, opening the front door.

Renny smiled at Eleanor as they stood for a moment by the
perambulator.

"Educating themselves!" he said.

"Good-night," she said, smiling as she shook hands. That is the
man, she said to herself, with a sudden rush of conviction, as she
came out into the frosty air, that I should like to have married.
She recognised a feeling which she had never felt. But he's twenty
years younger than I am, she thought, and married to my cousin.
For a moment she resented the passage of time and the accidents of
life which had swept her away - from all that, she said to herself.
And a scene came before her; Maggie and Renny sitting over the
fire. A happy marriage, she thought, that's what I was feeling all
the time. A happy marriage. She looked up as she walked down the
dark little street behind the others. A broad fan of light, like
the sail of a windmill, was sweeping slowly across the sky. It
seemed to take what she was feeling and to express it broadly and
simply, as if another voice were speaking in another language.
Then the light stopped and examined a fleecy patch of sky, a
suspected spot.

The raid! she said to herself. I'd forgotten the raid!

The others had come to the crossing; there they stood.

"I'd forgotten the raid!" she said aloud as she came up with them.
She was surprised; but it was true.

They were in Victoria Street. The street curved away, looking
wider and darker than usual. Little figures were hurrying along
the pavement; they emerged for a moment under a lamp, then vanished
into darkness again. The street was very empty.

"Will the omnibuses be running as usual?" Eleanor asked as they
stood there.

They looked round them. Nothing was coming along the street at the
moment.

"I shall wait here," said Eleanor.

"Then I shall go," said Sara abruptly. "Goodnight!"

She waved her hand and walked away. Eleanor took it for granted
that Nicholas would go with her.

"I shall wait here," she repeated.

But he did not move. Sara had already vanished. Eleanor looked at
him. Was he angry? Was he unhappy? She did not know. But here a
great form loomed up through the darkness; its lights were shrouded
with blue paint. Inside silent people sat huddled up; they looked
cadaverous and unreal in the blue light. "Good-night," she said,
shaking hands with Nicholas. She looked back and saw him still
standing on the pavement. He still held his hat in his hand. He
looked tall, impressive and solitary standing there alone, while
the searchlights wheeled across the sky.



The omnibus moved on. She found herself staring at an old man in
the corner who was eating something out of a paper bag. He looked
up and caught her staring at him.

"Like to see what I've  got for supper, lady?" he said, cocking one
eyebrow over his rheumy, twinkling old eyes. And he held out for
her inspection a hunk of bread on which was laid a slice of cold
meat or sausage.



1918


A veil of mist covered the November sky; a many folded veil, so
fine-meshed that it made one density. It was not raining, but here
and there the mist condensed on the surface into dampness and made
pavements greasy. Here and there on a grass blade or on a hedge
leaf a drop hung motionless. It was windless and calm. Sounds
coming through the veil - the bleat of sheep, the croak of rooks - 
were deadened. The uproar of the traffic merged into one growl.
Now and then as if a door opened and shut, or the veil parted and
closed, the roar boomed and faded.



"Dirty brute," Crosby muttered as she hobbled along the asphalt
path across Richmond Green. Her legs were paining her. It was not
actually raining, but the great open space was full of mist; and
there was nobody near, so that she could talk aloud.

"Dirty brute," she muttered again. She had got into the habit of
talking aloud. There was nobody in sight; the end of the path was
lost in mist. It was very silent. Only the rooks gathered on the
tree tops now and then let fall a queer little croak, and a leaf,
spotted with black, fell to the ground. Her face twitched as she
walked, as if her muscles had got into the habit of protesting,
involuntarily, against the spites and obstacles that tormented her.
She had aged greatly during the past four years. She looked so
small and hunched that it seemed doubtful if she could make her way
across the wide open space, shrouded in white mist. But she had to
go to the High Street to do her shopping.

"The dirty brute," she muttered again. She had had some words that
morning with Mrs Burt about the Count's bath. He spat in it, and
Mrs Burt had told her to clean it.

"Count indeed - he's no more Count than you are," she continued.
She was talking to Mrs Burt now. "I'm quite willing to oblige
you," she went on. Even out here, in the mist, where she was free
to say what she liked, she adopted a conciliatory tone, because she
knew that they wanted to be rid of her. She gesticulated with the
hand that was not carrying the bag as she told Louisa that she was
quite ready to oblige her. She hobbled on. "And I shouldn't  mind
going either," she added bitterly, but this was spoken to herself
only. It was no pleasure to her to live in the house any more; but
there was nowhere else for her to go; that the Burts knew very
well.

"And I'm quite ready to oblige you," she added aloud, as indeed she
had said to Louisa herself. But the truth was that she was no
longer able to work as she had done. Her legs pained her. It took
all the strength out of her to do her own shopping, let alone to
clean the bath. But it was all take-it-or-leave-it now. In the
old days she would have sent the whole lot packing.

"Drabs . . . hussies," she muttered. She was now addressing the
red-haired servant girl who had flung out of the house yesterday
without warning. SHE could easily get another job. It didn't 
matter to her. So it was left to Crosby to clean the Count's bath.

"Dirty brute, dirty brute," she repeated; her pale-blue eyes glared
impotently. She saw once more the blob of spittle that the Count
had left on the side of his bath - the Belgian who called himself a
Count. "I've  been used to work for gentlefolk, not for dirty
foreigners like you," she told him as she hobbled.

The roar of traffic sounded louder as she approached the ghostly
line of trees. She could see houses now beyond the trees. Her
pale-blue eyes peered forward through the mist as she made her way
towards the railings. Her eyes alone seemed to express an
unconquerable determination; she was not going to give in; she was
bent on surviving. The soft mist was slowly lifting. Leaves lay
damp and purple on the asphalt path. The rooks croaked and
shuffled on the tree tops. Now a dark line of railings emerged
from the mist. The roar of traffic in the High Street sounded
louder and louder. Crosby stopped and rested her bag on the
railing before she went on to do battle with the crowd of shoppers
in the High Street. She would have to shove and push, and be
jostled this way and that; and her feet pained her. They didn't 
mind if you bought or not, she thought; and often she was pushed
out of her place by some bold-faced drab. She thought of the red-
haired girl again, as she stood there, panting slightly, with her
bag on the railing. Her legs pained her. Suddenly the long-drawn
note of a siren floated out its melancholy wail of sound; then
there was a dull explosion.

"Them guns again," Crosby muttered, looking up at the pale-grey sky
with peevish irritation. The rooks, scared by the gun-fire, rose
and wheeled round the tree tops. Then there was another dull boom.
A man on a ladder who was painting the windows of one of the houses
paused with his brush in his hand and looked round. A woman who
was walking along carrying a loaf of bread that stuck half out of
its paper wrapping stopped too. They both waited as if for
something to happen. A topple of smoke drifted over and flopped
down from the chimneys. The guns boomed again. The man on the
ladder said something to the woman on the pavement. She nodded her
head. Then he dipped his brush in the pot and went on painting.
The woman walked on. Crosby pulled herself together and tottered
across the road into the High Street. The guns went on booming and
the sirens wailed. The war was over - so somebody told her as she
took her place in the queue at the grocer's shop. The guns went on
booming and the sirens wailed.



PRESENT DAY


It was a summer evening; the sun was setting; the sky was blue
still, but tinged with gold, as if a thin veil of gauze hung over
it, and here and there in the gold-blue amplitude an island of
cloud lay suspended. In the fields the trees stood majestically
caparisoned, with their innumerable leaves gilt. Sheep and cows,
pearl white and parti-coloured, lay recumbent or munched their way
through the half transparent grass. An edge of light surrounded
everything. A red-gold fume rose from the dust on the roads. Even
the little red brick villas on the high roads had become porous,
incandescent with light, and the flowers in cottage gardens, lilac
and pink like cotton dresses, shone veined as if lit from within.
Faces of people standing at cottage doors or padding along
pavements showed the same red glow as they fronted the slowly
sinking sun.



Eleanor came out of her flat and shut the door. Her face was lit
up by the glow of the sun as it sank over London, and for a moment
she was dazzled and looked out over the roofs and spires that lay
beneath. There were people talking inside her room, and she wanted
to have a word with her nephew alone. North, her brother Morris's
son, had just come back from Africa, and she had scarcely seen him
alone. So many people had dropped in that evening - Miriam Parrish;
Ralph Pickersgill; Antony Wedd; her niece Peggy, and on top of them
all, that very talkative man, her friend Nicholas Pomjalovsky, whom
they called Brown for short. She had scarcely had a word with
North alone. For a moment they stood in the bright square of
sunshine that fell on the stone floor of the passage. Voices were
still talking within. She put her hand on his shoulder.

"It's so nice to see you," she said. "And you haven't  changed . . ."
She looked at him. She still saw traces of the brown-eyed
cricketing boy in the massive man, who was so burnt, and a little
grey too over the ears. "We sha'n't  let you go back," she
continued, beginning to walk downstairs with him, "to that horrid
farm."

He smiled. "And you haven't  changed either," he said.

She looked very vigorous. She had been in India. Her face was
tanned with the sun. With her white hair and her brown cheeks she
scarcely looked her age, but she must be well over seventy, he was
thinking. They walked downstairs arm-in-arm. There were six
flights of stone steps to descend, but she insisted upon coming all
the way down with him, to see him off.

"And North," she said, when they reached the hall, "you will be
careful. . . ." She stopped on the doorstep. "Driving in London,"
she said, "isn't  the same as driving in Africa."

There was his little sports car outside; a man was going past the
door in the evening sunlight crying "Old chairs and baskets to
mend."

He shook his head; his voice was drowned by the voice of the man
crying. He glanced at a board that hung in the hall with names on
it. Who was in and who was out was signified with a care that
amused him slightly, after Africa. The voice of the man crying
"Old chairs and baskets to mend," slowly died away.

"Well, good-bye, Eleanor," he said turning. "We shall meet later."
He got into his car.

"Oh, but North - " she cried, suddenly remembering something she
wanted to say to him. But he had turned on the engine; he did not
hear her voice. He waved his hand to her - there she stood at the
top of the steps with her hair blowing in the wind. The car
started off with a jerk. She gave another wave of her hand to him
as he turned the corner.

Eleanor is just the same, he thought: more erratic perhaps. With a
room full of people - her little room had been crowded - she had
insisted upon showing him her new shower-bath. "You press that
knob," she had said, "and look - " Innumerable needles of water
shot down. He laughed aloud. They had sat on the edge of the bath
together.

But the cars behind him hooted persistently; they hooted and
hooted. What at? he asked. Suddenly he realised that they were
hooting at him. The light had changed; it was green now, he had
been blocking the way. He started off with a violent jerk. He had
not mastered the art of driving in London.

The noise of London still seemed to him deafening, and the speed at
which people drove was terrifying. But it was exciting after
Africa. The shops even, he thought, as he shot past rows of plate-
glass windows, were marvellous. Along the kerb, too, there were
barrows of fruit and flowers. Everywhere there was profusion;
plenty. . . . Again the red light shone out; he pulled up.

He looked about him. He was somewhere in Oxford Street; the
pavement was crowded with people; jostling each other; swarming
round the plate-glass windows which were still lit up. The gaiety,
the colour, the variety, were amazing after Africa. All these
years, he thought to himself, looking at a floating banner of
transparent silk, he had been used to raw goods; hides and fleeces;
here was the finished article. A dressing-case, of yellow leather
fitted with silver bottles, caught his eye. But the light was
green again. On he jerked.

He had only been back ten days, and his mind was a jumble of odds
and ends. It seemed to him that he had never stopped talking:
shaking hands; saying How-d'you-do? People sprang up everywhere;
his father; his sister; old men got up from armchairs and said, You
don't  remember me? Children he had left in the nursery were grown-
up men at college; girls with pigtails were now married women. He
was still confused by it all; they talked so fast; they must think
him very slow, he thought. He had to withdraw into the window and
say, "What, what, what do they mean by it?"

For instance, this evening at Eleanor's there was a man there with
a foreign accent who squeezed lemon into his tea. Who might he be,
he wondered? "One of Nell's dentists," said his sister Peggy,
wrinkling her lip. For they all had lines cut; phrases ready-made.
But that was the silent man on the sofa. It was the other one he
meant - squeezing lemon in his tea. "We call him Brown," she
murmured. Why Brown if he's a foreigner, he wondered. Anyhow they
all romanticized solitude and savagery - "I wish I'd done what you
did," said a little man called Pickersgill - except this man Brown,
who had said something that interested him. "If we do not know
ourselves, how can we know other people?" he had said. They had
been discussing dictators; Napoleon; the psychology of great men.
But there was the green light - "GO". He shot on again. And then
the lady with the ear-rings gushed about the beauties of Nature.
He glanced at the name of the street on the left. He was going to
dine with Sara but he had not much notion how to get there. He had
only heard her voice on the telephone saying, "Come and dine with
me - Milton Street, fifty-two, my name's on the door." It was near
the Prison Tower. But this man Brown - it was difficult to place
him at once. He talked, spreading his fingers out with the
volubility of a man who will in the end become a bore. And Eleanor
wandered about, holding a cup, telling people about her shower-
bath. He wished they would stick to the point. Talk interested
him. Serious talk on abstract subjects. "Was solitude good; was
society bad?" That was interesting; but they hopped from thing to
thing. When the large man said, "Solitary confinement is the
greatest torture we inflict," the meagre old woman with the wispy
hair at once piped up, laying her hand on her heart, "It ought to
be abolished!" She visited prisons, it seemed.

"Where the dickens am I now?" he asked, peering at the name on the
street corner. Somebody had chalked a circle on the wall with a
jagged line in it. He looked down the long vista. Door after
door, window after window, repeated the same pattern. There was a
red-yellow glow over it all, for the sun was sinking through the
London dust. Everything was tinged with a warm yellow haze.
Barrows full of fruit and flowers were drawn up at the kerb. The
sun gilded the fruit; the flowers had a blurred brilliance; there
were roses, carnations and lilies too. He had half a mind to stop
and buy a bunch to take to Sally. But the cars were hooting behind
him. He went on. A bunch of flowers, he thought, held in the hand
would soften the awkwardness of meeting and the usual things that
had to be said. "How nice to see you - you've  filled out," and so
on. He had only heard her voice on the telephone, and people
changed after all these years. Whether this was the right street
or not, he could not be sure; he filtered slowly round the corner.
Then stopped; then went on again. This was Milton Street, a dusky
street, with old houses, now let out as lodgings; but they had seen
better days.

"The odds on that side; the evens on this," he said. The street
was blocked with vans. He hooted. He stopped. He hooted again.
A man went to the horse's head, for it was a coal-cart, and the
horse slowly plodded on. Fifty-two was just along the row. He
dribbled up to the door. He stopped.

A voice pealed out across the street, the voice of a woman singing
scales.

"What a dirty," he said, as he sat still in the car for a moment - 
here a woman crossed the street with a jug under her arm - 'sordid,"
he added, "low-down street to live in." He cut off his engine; got
out, and examined the names on the door. Names mounted one above
another; here on a visiting-card, here engraved on brass - Foster;
Abrahamson; Roberts; S. Pargiter was near the top, punched on a
strip of aluminium. He rang one of the many bells. No one came.
The woman went on singing scales, mounting slowly. The mood comes,
the mood goes, he thought. He used to write poetry; now the mood
had come again as he stood there waiting. He pressed the bell two
or three times sharply. But no one answered. Then he gave the
door a push; it was open. There was a curious smell in the hall;
of vegetables cooking; and the oily brown paper made it dark. He
went up the stairs of what had once been a gentleman's residence.
The banisters were carved; but they had been daubed over with some
cheap yellow varnish. He mounted slowly and stood on the landing,
uncertain which door to knock at. He was always finding himself
now outside the doors of strange houses. He had a feeling that he
was no one and nowhere in particular. From across the road came
the voice of the singer deliberately ascending the scale, as if the
notes were stairs; and here she stopped indolently, languidly,
flinging out the voice that was nothing but pure sound. Then he
heard somebody inside, laughing.

That's her voice, he said. But there is somebody with her. He was
annoyed. He had hoped to find her alone. The voice was speaking
and did not answer when he knocked. Very cautiously he opened the
door and went in.

"Yes, yes, yes," Sara was saying. She was kneeling at the
telephone talking; but there was nobody there. She raised her hand
when she saw him and smiled at him; but she kept her hand raised as
if the noise he had made caused her to lose what she was trying to
hear.

"What?" she said, speaking into the telephone. "What?" He stood
silent, looking at the silhouettes of his grandparents on the
mantelpiece. There were no flowers, he observed. He wished he had
brought her some. He listened to what she was saying; he tried to
piece it together.

"Yes, now I can hear. . . . Yes, you're right. Someone has come
in. . . . Who? North. My cousin from Africa. . . ."

That's me, North thought. "My cousin from Africa." That's my
label.

"You've  met him?" she was saying. There was a pause. "D'you think
so?" she said. She turned and looked at him. They must be
discussing him, he thought. He felt uncomfortable.

"Good-bye," she said, and put down the telephone.

"He says he met you tonight," she said, going up to him and taking
his hand. "And liked you," she added, smiling.

"Who was that?" he asked, feeling awkward; but he had no flowers to
give her.

"A man you met at Eleanor's," she said.

"A foreigner?" he asked.

"Yes. Called Brown," she said, pushing up a chair for him.

He sat down on the chair she had pushed out for him, and she curled
up opposite with her foot under her. He remembered the attitude;
she came back in sections; first the voice; then the attitude; but
something remained unknown.

"You've  not changed," he said - the face he meant. A plain face
scarcely changed; whereas beautiful faces wither. She looked
neither young nor old; but shabby; and the room, with the pampas
grass in a pot in the corner, was untidy. A lodging-house room
tidied in a hurry he guessed.

"And you - " she said, looking at him. It was as if she were trying
to put two different versions of him together; the one on the
telephone perhaps and the one on the chair. Or was there some
other? This half knowing people, this half being known, this
feeling of the eye on the flesh, like a fly crawling - how
uncomfortable it was, he thought; but inevitable, after all these
years. The tables were littered; he hesitated, holding his hat in
his hand. She smiled at him, as he sat there, holding his hat
uncertainly.

"Who's the young Frenchman," she said, "with the top hat in the
picture?"

"What picture?" he asked.

"The one who sits looking puzzled with his hat in his hand," she
said. He put his hat on the table, but awkwardly. A book fell to
the floor.

"Sorry," he said. She meant, presumably, when she compared him to
the puzzled man in the picture, that he was clumsy; he always had
been.

"This isn't  the room where I came last time?" he asked.

He recognised a chair - a chair with gilt claws; there was the usual
piano.

"No - that was on the other side of the river," she said, "when you
came to say good-bye."

He remembered. He had come to her the evening before he left for
the war; and he had hung his cap on the bust of their grandfather - 
that had vanished. And she had mocked him.

"How many lumps of sugar does a lieutenant in His Majesty's Royal
Regiment of Rat-catchers require?" she had sneered. He could see
her now dropping lumps of sugar into his tea. And they had
quarrelled. And he had left her. It was the night of the raid, he
remembered. He remembered the dark night; the searchlights that
slowly swept over the sky; here and there they stopped to ponder a
fleecy patch; little pellets of shot fell; and people scudded along
the empty blue shrouded streets. He had been going to Kensington
to dine with his family; he had said good-bye to his mother; he had
never seen her again.

The voice of the singer interrupted. "Ah - h-h, oh-h-h, ah - h-h,
oh - h-h," she sang, languidly climbing up and down the scale on the
other side of the street.

"Does she go on like that every night?" he asked. Sara nodded.
The notes coming through the humming evening air sounded slow and
sensuous. The singer seemed to have endless leisure; she could
rest on every stair.

And there was no sign of dinner, he observed; only a dish of fruit
on the cheap lodging-house tablecloth, already yellowed with some
gravy stain.

"Why d'you always choose slums - " he was beginning, for children
were screaming in the street below, when the door opened and a girl
came in carrying a bunch of knives and forks. The regular lodging-
house skivvy, North thought; with red hands, and one of those
jaunty white caps that girls in lodging-houses clap on top of their
hair when the lodger has a party. In her presence they had to make
conversation. "I've  been seeing Eleanor," he said. "That was
where I met your friend Brown. . . ."

The girl made a clatter laying the table with the knives and forks
she held in a bunch.

"Oh, Eleanor," said Sara. "Eleanor - " But she watched the girl
going clumsily round the table; she breathed rather hard as she
laid it.

"She's just back from India," he said. He too watched the girl
laying the table. Now she stood a bottle of wine among the cheap
lodging-house crockery.

"Gallivanting round the world," Sara murmured.

"And entertaining the oddest set of old fogies," he added. He
thought of the little man with the fierce blue eyes who wished he
had been in Africa; and the wispy woman with beads who visited
prisons it seemed.

". . . and that man, your friend - " he began. Here the girl went
out of the room, but she left the door open, a sign that she was
about to come back.

"Nicholas," said Sara, finishing his sentence. "The man you call
Brown."

There was a pause. "And what did you talk about?" she asked.

He tried to remember.

"Napoleon; the psychology of great men; if we don't  know ourselves
how can we know other people . . ." He stopped. It was difficult
to remember accurately what had been said even one hour ago.

"And then," she said, holding out one hand and touching a finger
exactly as Brown had done, " - how can we make laws, religions, that
fit, that fit, when we don't  know ourselves?"

"Yes! Yes!" he exclaimed. She had caught his manner exactly; the
slight foreign accent; the repetition of the little word "fit", as
if he were not quite sure of the shorter words in English.

"And Eleanor," Sara continued, 'says . . . 'Can we improve - can we
improve ourselves?' sitting on the edge of the sofa?"

"Of the bath," he laughed, correcting her.

"You've  had that talk before," he said. That was precisely what he
was feeling. They had talked before. "And then," he continued,
"we discussed. . . ."

But here the girl burst in again. She had plates in her hand this
time; blue-ringed plates, cheap lodging-house plates: " - society or
solitude; which is best," he finished his sentence.

Sara kept looking at the table. "And which," she asked, in the
distracted way of someone who with their surface senses watches
what is being done, but at the same time thinks of something else
" - which did you say? You who've  been alone all these years," she
said. The girl left the room again. " - among your sheep, North."
She broke off; for now a trombone player had struck up in the
street below, and as the voice of the woman practising her scales
continued, they sounded like two people trying to express
completely different views of the world in general at one and the
same time. The voice ascended; the trombone wailed. They laughed.

". . . Sitting on the verandah," she resumed, "looking at the
stars."

He looked up: was she quoting something? He remembered he had
written to her when he first went out. "Yes, looking at the
stars," he said.

"Sitting on the verandah in the silence," she added. A van went
past the window. All sounds were for the moment obliterated.

"And then . . ." she said as the van rattled away - she paused as if
she were referring to something else that he had written.

" - then you saddled a horse," she said, "and rode away!"

She jumped up, and for the first time he saw her face in the full
light. There was a smudge on the side of her nose.

"D'you know," he said, looking at her, "that you've  a smudge on
your face?"

She touched the wrong cheek.

"Not that side - the other," he said.

She left the room without looking in the glass. From which we
deduce the fact, he said to himself, as if he were writing a novel,
that Miss Sara Pargiter has never attracted the love of men. Or
had she? He did not know. These little snapshot pictures of
people left much to be desired, these little surface pictures that
one made, like a fly crawling over a face, and feeling, here's the
nose, here's the brow.



He strolled to the window. The sun must be setting, for the brick
of the house at the corner blushed a yellowish pink. One or two
high windows were burnished gold. The girl was in the room, and
she distracted him; also the noise of London still bothered him.
Against the dull background of traffic noises, of wheels turning
and brakes squeaking, there rose near at hand the cry of a woman
suddenly alarmed for her child; the monotonous cry of a man selling
vegetables; and far away a barrel organ was playing. It stopped;
it began again. I used to write to her, he thought, late at night,
when I felt lonely, when I was young. He looked at himself in the
glass. He saw his sunburnt face with the broad cheek bones and the
little brown eyes.

The girl had been sucked down into the lower portion of the house.
The door stood open. Nothing seemed to be happening. He waited.
He felt an outsider. After all these years, he thought, everyone
was paired off; settled down; busy with their own affairs. You
found them telephoning, remembering other conversations; they went
out of the room; they left one alone. He took up a book and read a
sentence.

"A shadow like an angel with bright hair . . ."



Next moment she came in. But there seemed to be some hitch in the
proceedings. The door was open; the table laid; but nothing
happened. They stood together, waiting, with their backs to the
fireplace.

"How strange it must be," she resumed, "coming back after all these
years - as if you'd dropped from the clouds in an aeroplane," she
pointed to the table as if that were the field in which he had
landed.

"On to an unknown land," said North. He leant forward and touched
a knife on the table.

" - and finding people talking," she added.

" - talking, talking," he said, "about money and politics," he
added, giving the fender behind him a vicious little kick with his
heel.

Here the girl came in. She wore an air of importance derived
apparently from the dish she carried, for it was covered with a
great metal cover. She raised the cover with a certain flourish.
There was a leg of mutton underneath. "Let's dine," said Sara.

"I'm hungry," he added.

They sat down and she took the carving-knife and made a long
incision. A thin trickle of red juice ran out; it was underdone.
She looked at it.

"Mutton oughtn't  to be like that," she said. "Beef - but not
mutton."

They watched the red juice running down into the well of the dish.

"Shall we send it back," she said, "or eat it as it is?"

"Eat it," he said. "I've  eaten far worse joints than this," he
added.

"In Africa . . ." she said, lifting the lids of the vegetable
dishes. There was a slabbed-down mass of cabbage in one oozing
green water; in the other, yellow potatoes that looked hard.

". . . in Africa, in the wilds of Africa," she resumed, helping
him to cabbage, "in that farm you were on, where no one came for
months at a time, and you sat on the verandah listening - "

"To sheep," he said. He was cutting his mutton into strips. It
was tough.

"And there was nothing to break the silence," she went on, helping
herself to potatoes, "but a tree falling, or a rock breaking from
the side of a distant mountain - " She looked at him as if to
verify the sentences that she was quoting from his letters.

"Yes," he said. "It was very silent."

"And hot," she added. "Blazing hot at midday: an old tramp tapped
on your door . . . ?"

He nodded. He saw himself again, a young man, and very lonely.

"And then - " she began again. But a great lorry came crashing down
the street. Something rattled on the table. The walls and the
floor seemed to tremble. She parted two glasses that were jingling
together. The lorry passed; they heard it rumbling away in the
distance.

"And the birds," she went on. "The nightingales, singing in the
moonlight?"

He felt uncomfortable at the vision she called up. "I must have
written you a lot of nonsense!" he exclaimed. "I wish you'd torn
them up - those letters!"

"No! They were beautiful letters! Wonderful letters!" she
exclaimed, raising her glass. A thimbleful of wine always made her
tipsy, he remembered. Her eyes shone; her cheeks glowed.

"And then you had a day off," she went on, "and jolted along a
rough white road in a springless cart to the next town - "

"Sixty miles away," he said.

"And went to a bar; and met a man from the next - ranch?" She
hesitated as if the word might be the wrong one.

"Ranch, yes, ranch," he confirmed her. "I went to the town and had
a drink at the bar - "

"And then?" she said. He laughed. There were some things he had
not told her. He was silent.

"Then you stopped writing," she said. She put her glass down.

"When I forgot what you were like," he said, looking at her.

"You gave up writing too," he said.

"Yes, I too," she said.

The trombone had moved his station and was wailing lugubriously
under the window. The doleful sound, as if a dog had thrown back
its head and were baying the moon, floated up to them. She waved
her fork in time to it.

"Our hearts full of tears, our lips full of laughter, we passed on
the stairs" - she dragged her words out to fit the wail of the
trombone - "we passed on the stair-r-r-r-s" - but here the trombone
changed its measure to a jig. "He to sorrow, I to bliss," she
jigged with it, "he to bliss and I to sorrow, we passed on the
stair-r-r-s."

She set her glass down.

"Another cut off the joint?" she asked.

"No, thank you," he said, looking at the rather stringy
disagreeable object which was still bleeding into the well. The
willow-pattern plate was daubed with gory streaks. She stretched
her hand out and rang the bell. She rang; she rang a second time.
No one came.

"Your bells don't  ring," he said.

"No," she smiled. "The bells don't  ring, and the taps don't  run."
She thumped on the floor. They waited. No one came. The trombone
wailed outside.

"But there was one letter you wrote me," he continued as they
waited. "An angry letter; a cruel letter."

He looked at her. She had lifted her lip like a horse that is
going to bite. That, too, he remembered.

"Yes?" she said.

"The night you came in from the Strand," he reminded her.

Here the girl came in with the pudding. It was an ornate pudding,
semi-transparent, pink, ornamented with blobs of cream.

"I remember," said Sara, sticking her spoon into the quivering
jelly, "a still autumn night; the lights lit; and people padding
along the pavement with wreaths in their hands?"

"Yes," he nodded. "That was it."

"And I said to myself," she paused, "this is Hell. We are the
damned?" He nodded.

She helped him to pudding.

"And I," he said, as he took his plate, "was among the damned." He
stuck his spoon into the quivering mass that she had given him.

"Coward; hypocrite, with your switch in your hand; and your cap on
your head - " He seemed to quote from a letter that she had written
him. He paused. She smiled at him.

"But what was the word - the word I used?" she asked, as if she were
trying to remember.

"Poppycock!" he reminded her. She nodded.

"And then I went over the bridge," she resumed, raising her spoon
half-way to her mouth, "and stopped in one of those little alcoves,
bays, what d'you call 'em? - scooped out over the water, and looked
down - " She looked down at her plate.

"When you lived on the other side of the river," he prompted her.

"Stood and looked down," she said, looking at her glass which she
held in front of her, "and thought; Running water, flowing water,
water that crinkles up the lights; moonlight; starlight - " She
drank and was silent.

"Then the car came," he prompted her.

"Yes; the Rolls-Royce. It stopped in the lamplight and there they
sat - "

"Two people," he reminded her.

"Two people. Yes," she said. "He was smoking a cigar. An upper-
class Englishman with a big nose, in a dress suit. And she,
sitting beside him, in a fur-trimmed cloak, took advantage of the
pause under the lamplight to raise her hand" - she raised her hand - 
"and polish that spade, her mouth."

She swallowed her mouthful.

"And the peroration?" he prompted her.

She shook her head.

They were silent. North had finished his pudding. He took out his
cigarette-case. Save for a dish of rather fly-blown fruit, apples
and bananas, there was no more to eat apparently.

"We were very foolish when we were young, Sal," he said, as he lit
his cigarette, "writing purple passages . . ."

"At dawn with the sparrows chirping," she said, pulling the plate
of fruit towards her. She began peeling a banana, as if she were
unsheathing some soft glove. He took an apple and peeled it. The
curl of apple-skin lay on his plate, coiled up like a snake's skin,
he thought; and the banana-skin was like the finger of a glove that
had been ripped open.

The street was now quiet. The woman had stopped singing. The
trombone-player had moved off. The rush hour was over and nothing
went down the street. He looked at her, biting little bits off her
banana.

When she came to the fourth of June, he remembered, she wore her
skirt the wrong way round. She was crooked in those days too; and
they had laughed at her - he and Peggy. She had never married; he
wondered why not. He swept up the broken coils of apple-peel on
his plate.

"What does he do," he said suddenly, " - that man who throws his
hands out?"

"Like this?" she said. She threw her hands out.

"Yes," he nodded. That was the man - one of those voluble
foreigners with a theory about everything. Yet he had liked him - 
he gave off an aroma; a whirr; his flexible supple face worked
amusingly; he had a round forehead; good eyes; and was bald.

"What does he do?" he repeated.

"Talks," she replied, "about the soul." She smiled. Again he felt
an outsider; so many talks there must have been between them; such
intimacy.

"About the soul," she continued, taking a cigarette. "Lectures,"
she added, lighting it. "Ten and six for a seat in the front row,"
she puffed her smoke out. "There's standing room at half a crown;
but then," she puffed, "you don't  hear so well. You only catch
half the lesson of the Teacher, the Master," she laughed.

She was sneering at him now; she conveyed the impression that he
was a charlatan. Yet Peggy had said that they were very intimate - 
she and this foreigner. The vision of the man at Eleanor's changed
slightly like an air ball blown aside.

"I thought he was a friend of yours," he said aloud.

"Nicholas?" she exclaimed. "I love him!"

Her eyes certainly glowed. They fixed themselves upon a salt
cellar with a look of rapture that made North feel once more
puzzled.

"You love him. . ." he began. But here the telephone rang.

"There he is!" she exclaimed. "That's him! That's Nicholas!"

She spoke with extreme irritation.

The telephone rang again. "I'm not here!" she said. The telephone
rang again. "Not here! Not here! Not here!" she repeated in time
to the bell. She made no attempt to answer it. He could stand the
stab of her voice and the bell no longer. He went over to the
telephone. There was a pause as he stood with the receiver in his
hand.

"Tell him I'm not here!" she said.

"Hullo," he said, answering the telephone. But there was a pause.
He looked at her sitting on the edge of her chair, swinging her
foot up and down. Then a voice spoke.

"I'm North," he answered the telephone. "I'm dining with Sara. . . .
Yes, I'll tell her. . . ." He looked at her again. "She is
sitting on the edge of her chair," he said, "with a smudge on her
face, swinging her foot up and down."



Eleanor stood holding the telephone. She smiled, and for a moment
after she had put the receiver back stood there, still smiling,
before she turned to her niece Peggy who had been dining with her.

"North is dining with Sara," she said, smiling at the little
telephone picture of two people at the other end of London, one of
whom was sitting on the edge of her chair with a smudge on her
face.

"He's dining with Sara," she said again. But her niece did not
smile, for she had not seen the picture, and she was slightly
irritated because, in the middle of what they were saying, Eleanor
suddenly got up and said, "I'll just remind Sara."

"Oh, is he?" she said casually.

Eleanor came and sat down.

"We were saying - " she began.

"You've  had it cleaned," said Peggy simultaneously. While Eleanor
telephoned, she had been looking at the picture of her grandmother
over the writing-table.

"Yes," Eleanor glanced back over her shoulder. "Yes. And do you
see there's a flower fallen on the grass?" she said. She turned
and looked at the picture. The face, the dress, the basket of
flowers all shone softly melting into each other, as if the paint
were one smooth coat of enamel. There was a flower - a little sprig
of blue - lying in the grass.

"It was hidden by the dirt," said Eleanor. "But I can just
remember it, when I was a child. That reminds me, if you want a
good man to clean pictures - "

"But was it like her?" Peggy interrupted.

Somebody had told her that she was like her grandmother: and she
did not want to be like her. She wanted to be dark and aquiline:
but in fact she was blue-eyed and round-faced - like her
grandmother.

"I've  got the address somewhere," Eleanor went on.

"Don't  bother - don't  bother," said Peggy, irritated by her aunt's
habit of adding unnecessary details. It was age coming on, she
supposed: age that loosened screws and made the whole apparatus of
the mind rattle and jingle.

"Was it like her?" she asked again.

"Not as I remember her," said Eleanor, glancing once more at the
picture. "When I was a child perhaps - no, I don't  think even as a
child. What's so interesting," she continued, "is that what they
thought ugly - red hair for instance - we think pretty; so that I
often ask myself," she paused, puffing at her cheroot, "'What is
pretty?'"

"Yes," said Peggy. "That's what we were saying."

For when Eleanor suddenly took it into her head that she must
remind Sara of the party, they had been talking about Eleanor's
childhood - how things had changed; one thing seemed good to one
generation, another to another. She liked getting Eleanor to talk
about her past; it seemed to her so peaceful and so safe.

"Is there any standard, d'you think?" she said, wishing to bring
her back to what they were saying.

"I wonder," said Eleanor absentmindedly. She was thinking of
something else.

"How annoying!" she exclaimed suddenly. "I had it on the tip of my
tongue - something I want to ask you. Then I thought of Delia's
party: then North made me laugh - Sally sitting on the edge of her
chair with a smudge on her nose; and that's put it out of my head."
She shook her head.

"D'you know the feeling when one's been on the point of saying
something, and been interrupted; how it seems to stick HERE," she
tapped her forehead, 'so that it stops everything else? Not that
it was anything of importance," she added. She wandered about the
room for a moment. "No, I give it up; I give it up," she said,
shaking her head.

"I shall go and get ready now, if you'll call a cab."

She went into the bedroom. Soon there was the sound of running
water.

Peggy lit another cigarette. If Eleanor were going to wash, as
seemed likely from the sounds in the bedroom, there was no need to
hurry about the cab. She glanced at the letters on the
mantelpiece. An address stuck out on the top of one of them - "Mon
Repos, Wimbledon." One of Eleanor's dentists, Peggy thought to
herself. The man she went botanising with on Wimbledon Common
perhaps. A charming man. Eleanor had described him. "He says
every tooth is quite unlike every other tooth. And he knows all
about plants. . . ." It was difficult to get her to stick to her
childhood.

She crossed to the telephone; she gave the number. There was a
pause. As she waited she looked at her hands holding the
telephone. Efficient, shell-like, polished but not painted,
they're a compromise, she thought, looking at her finger-nails,
between science and . . . But here a voice said "Number, please,"
and she gave it.

Again she waited. As she sat where Eleanor had sat she saw the
telephone picture that Eleanor had seen - Sally sitting on the edge
of her chair with a smudge on her face. What a fool, she thought
bitterly, and a thrill ran down her thigh. Why was she bitter?
For she prided herself upon being honest - she was a doctor - and
that thrill she knew meant bitterness. Did she envy her because
she was happy, or was it the croak of some ancestral prudery - did
she disapprove of these friendships with men who did not love
women? She looked at the picture of her grandmother as if to ask
her opinion. But she had assumed the immunity of a work of art;
she seemed as she sat there, smiling at her roses, to be
indifferent to our right and wrong.

"Hullo," said a gruff voice, which suggested sawdust and a shelter,
and she gave the address and put down the telephone just as Eleanor
came in - she was wearing a red-gold Arab cloak with a silver veil
over her hair.

"One of these days d'you think you'll be able to see things at the
end of the telephone?" Peggy said, getting up. Eleanor's hair was
her beauty, she thought; and her silver-washed dark eyes - a fine
old prophetess, a queer old bird, venerable and funny at one and
the same time. She was burnt from her travels so that her hair
looked whiter than ever.

"What's that?" said Eleanor, for she had not caught her remark
about the telephone. Peggy did not repeat it. They stood at the
window waiting for the cab. They stood there side by side, silent,
looking out, because there was a pause to fill up, and the view
from the window, which was so high over the roofs, over the squares
and angles of back gardens to the blue line of hills in the
distance served, like another voice speaking, to fill up the pause.
The sun was setting; one cloud lay curled like a red feather in the
blue. She looked down. It was queer to see cabs turning corners,
going round this street and down the other, and not to hear the
sound they made. It was like a map of London; a section laid
beneath them. The summer day was fading; lights were being lit,
primrose lights, still separate, for the glow of the sunset was
still in the air. Eleanor pointed at the sky.

"That's where I saw my first aeroplane - there between those
chimneys," she said. There were high chimneys, factory chimneys,
in the distance; and a great building - Westminster Cathedral was
it? - over there riding above the roofs.

"I was standing here, looking out," Eleanor went on. "It must have
been just after I'd got into the flat, a summer's day, and I saw a
black spot in the sky, and I said to whoever it was - Miriam
Parrish, I think, yes, for she came to help me to get into the
flat - I hope Delia, by the way, remembered to ask her - " . . .
that's old age, Peggy noted, bringing in one thing after another.

"You said to Miriam - " she prompted her.

"I said to Miriam, 'Is it a bird? No, I don't  think it can be a
bird. It's too big. Yet it moves.' And suddenly it came over me,
that's an aeroplane! And it was! You know they'd flown the
Channel not so very long before. I was staying with you in Dorset
at the time: and I remember reading it out in the paper, and
someone - your father, I think - said: 'The world will never be the
same again!"

"Oh, well - " Peggy laughed. She was about to say that aeroplanes
hadn't  made all that difference, for it was her line to disabuse
her elders of their belief in science, partly because their
credulity amused her, partly because she was daily impressed by the
ignorance of doctors - when Eleanor sighed.

"Oh dear," she murmured.

She turned away from the window.

Old age again, Peggy thought. Some gust blew open a door: one of
the many millions in Eleanor's seventy-odd years; out came a
painful thought; which she at once concealed - she had gone to her
writing-table and was fidgeting with papers - with the humble
generosity, the painful humility of the old.

"What, Nell - ?" Peggy began.

"Nothing, nothing," said Eleanor. She had seen the sky; and that
sky was laid with pictures - she had seen it so often; any one of
which might come uppermost when she looked at it. Now, because she
had been talking to North, it brought back the war; how she had
stood there one night, watching the searchlights. She had come
home, after a raid; she had been dining in Westminster with Renny
and Maggie. They had sat in a cellar; and Nicholas - it was the
first time she had met him - had said that the war was of no
importance. "We are children playing with fireworks in the back
garden" . . . she remembered his phrase; and how, sitting round a
wooden packing-case, they had drunk to a new world. "A new world - 
a new world!" Sally had cried, drumming with her spoon on top of
the packing-case. She turned to her writing-table, tore up a
letter and threw it away.

"Yes," she said, fumbling among her papers, looking for something.
"Yes - I don't  know about aeroplanes, I've  never been up in one; but
motor cars - I could do without motor cars. I was almost knocked
down by one, did I tell you? In the Brompton Road. All my own
fault - I wasn't  looking. . . . And wireless - that's a nuisance - 
the people downstairs turn it on after breakfast; but on the other
hand - hot water; electric light; and those new - " She paused.
"Ah, there it is!" she exclaimed. She pounced upon some paper that
she had been hunting for. "If Edward's there tonight, do remind
me - I'll tie a knot in my handkerchief. . . ."

She opened her bag, took out a silk handkerchief, and proceeded
solemnly to tie it into a knot . . . "to ask him about Runcorn's
boy."

The bell rang.

"The taxi," she said.

She glanced about to make sure that she had forgotten nothing. She
stopped suddenly. Her eye had been caught by the evening paper,
which lay on the floor with its broad bar of print and its blurred
photograph. She picked it up.

"What a face!" she exclaimed, flattening it out on the table.

As far as Peggy could see, but she was short-sighted, it was the
usual evening paper's blurred picture of a fat man gesticulating.

"Damned - " Eleanor shot out suddenly, "bully!" She tore the paper
across with one sweep of her hand and flung it on the floor. Peggy
was shocked. A little shiver ran over her skin as the paper tore.
The word "damned" on her aunt's lips had shocked her.

Next moment she was amused; but still she had been shocked. For
when Eleanor, who used English so reticently, said "damned" and
then "bully," it meant much more than the words she and her friends
used. And her gesture, tearing the paper . . . What a queer set
they are, she thought, as she followed Eleanor down the stairs.
Her red-gold cloak trailed from step to step. So she had seen her
father crumple The Times and sit trembling with rage because
somebody had said something in a newspaper. How odd!

And the way she tore it! she thought, half laughing, and she flung
out her hand as Eleanor had flung hers. Eleanor's figure still
seemed erect with indignation. It would be simple, she thought, it
would be satisfactory, she thought, following her down flight after
flight of stone steps, to be like that. The little knob on her
cloak tapped on the stairs. They descended rather slowly.

"Take my aunt," she said to herself, beginning to arrange the scene
into an argument she had been having with a man at the hospital,
"take my aunt, living alone in a sort of workman's flat at the top
of six flights of stairs . . ." Eleanor stopped.

"Don't  tell me," she said, "that I left the letter upstairs - 
Runcorn's letter that I want to show Edward, about the boy?" She
opened her bag. "No: here it is." There it was in her bag. They
went on downstairs.

Eleanor gave the address to the cabman and sat down with a jerk in
her corner. Peggy glanced at her out of the corner of her eye.

It was the force that she had put into the words that impressed
her, not the words. It was as if she still believed with
passion - she, old Eleanor - in the things that man had destroyed.
A wonderful generation, she thought, as they drove off.
Believers . . .

"You see," Eleanor interrupted, as if she wanted to explain her
words, "it means the end of everything we cared for."

"Freedom?" said Peggy perfunctorily.

"Yes," said Eleanor. "Freedom and justice."

The cab drove off down the mild respectable little streets where
every house had its bow window, its strip of garden, its private
name. As they drove on, into the big main street, the scene in the
flat composed itself in Peggy's mind as she would tell it to the
man in the hospital. "Suddenly she lost her temper," she said,
"took the paper and tore it across - my aunt, who's over seventy."
She glanced at Eleanor to verify the details. Her aunt interrupted
her.

"That's where we used to live," she said. She waved her hand
towards a long lamp-starred street on the left. Peggy, looking
out, could just see the imposing unbroken avenue with its
succession of pale pillars and steps. The repeated columns, the
orderly architecture, had even a pale pompous beauty as one stucco
column repeated another stucco column all down the street.

"Abercorn Terrace," said Eleanor; ". . . the pillar-box," she
murmured as they drove past. Why the pillar-box? Peggy asked
herself. Another door had been opened. Old age must have endless
avenues, stretching away and away down its darkness, she supposed,
and now one door opened and then another.

"Aren't  people - " Eleanor began. Then she stopped. As usual, she
had begun in the wrong place.

"Yes?" said Peggy. She was irritated by this inconsequence.

"I was going to say - the pillar-box made me think," Eleanor began;
then she laughed. She gave up the attempt to account for the order
in which her thoughts came to her. There was an order, doubtless;
but it took so long to find it, and this rambling, she knew,
annoyed Peggy, for young people's minds worked so quickly.

"That's where we used to dine," she broke off, nodding at a big
house at the corner of a square. "Your father and I. The man he
used to read with. What was his name? He became a Judge. . . .
We used to dine there, the three of us. Morris, my father and
I. . . . They had very large parties in those days. Always legal
people. And he collected old oak. Mostly shams," she added with a
little chuckle.

"You used to dine . . ." Peggy began. She wished to get her back
to her past. It was so interesting; so safe; so unreal - that past
of the 'eighties; and to her, so beautiful in its unreality.

"Tell me about your youth . . ." she began.

"But your lives are much more interesting than ours were," said
Eleanor. Peggy was silent.

They were driving along a bright crowded street; here stained ruby
with the light from picture palaces; here yellow from shop windows
gay with summer dresses, for the shops, though shut, were still lit
up, and people were still looking at dresses, at flights of hats on
little rods, at jewels.

When my Aunt Delia comes to town, Peggy continued the story of
Eleanor that she was telling her friend at the hospital, she says,
We must have a party. Then they all flock together. They love it.
As for herself, she hated it. She would far rather have stayed at
home or gone to the pictures. It's the sense of the family, she
added, glancing at Eleanor as if to collect another little fact
about her to add to her portrait of a Victorian spinster. Eleanor
was looking out of the window. Then she turned.

"And the experiment with the guinea-pig - how did that go off?" she
asked. Peggy was puzzled.

Then she remembered and told her.

"I see. So it proved nothing. So you've  got to begin all over
again. That's very interesting. Now I wish you'd explain to
me . . ." There was another problem that puzzled her.

The things she wants explained, Peggy said to her friend at the
Hospital, are either as simple as two and two make four, or so
difficult that nobody in the world knows the answer. And if you
say to her, "What's eight times eight?" - she smiled at the profile
of her aunt against the window - she taps her forehead and says . . .
but again Eleanor interrupted her.

"It's so good of you to come," she said, giving her a little pat on
the knee.  But did I show her, Peggy thought, that I hate coming? 

"It's a way of seeing people," Eleanor continued. "And now that
we're all getting on - not you, us - one doesn't  like to miss
chances."

They drove on. And how does one get THAT right? Peggy thought,
trying to add another touch to the portrait. "Sentimental" was
it? Or, on the contrary, was it good to feel like that . . .
natural . . . right? She shook her head. I'm no use at describing
people, she said to her friend at the Hospital. They're too
difficult. . . . She's not like that - not like that at all, she
said, making a little dash with her hand as if to rub out an outline
that she had drawn wrongly. As she did so, her friend at the
Hospital vanished.

She was alone with Eleanor in the cab. And they were passing
houses. Where does she begin, and where do I end? she thought. . . .
On they drove. They were two living people, driving across
London; two sparks of life enclosed in two separate bodies; and
those sparks of life enclosed in two separate bodies are at this
moment, she thought, driving past a picture palace. But what is
this moment; and what are we? The puzzle was too difficult for her
to solve it. She sighed.

"You're too young to feel that," said Eleanor.

"What?" Peggy asked with a little start.

"About meeting people. About not missing chances of seeing them."

"Young?" said Peggy. "I shall never be as young as you are!"
She patted her Aunt's knee in her turn. "Gallivanting off to
India . . ." she laughed.

"Oh, India. India's nothing nowadays," said Eleanor. "Travel's so
easy. You just take a ticket; just get on board ship. . . . But
what I want to see before I die," she continued, "is something
different. . . ." She waved her hand out of the window. They were
passing public buildings; offices of some sort. ". . . another
kind of civilisation. Tibet, for instance. I was reading a book
by a man called - now what was he called?"

She paused, distracted by the sights in the street. "Don't  people
wear pretty clothes nowadays?" she said, pointing to a girl with
fair hair and a young man in evening dress.

"Yes," said Peggy perfunctorily, looking at the painted face and
the bright shawl; at the white waistcoat and the smoothed back
hair. Anything distracts Eleanor, everything interests her, she
thought.

"Was it that you were suppressed when you were young?" she said
aloud, recalling vaguely some childish memory; her grandfather with
the shiny stumps instead of fingers; and a long dark drawing-room.
Eleanor turned. She was surprised.

"Suppressed?" she repeated. She so seldom thought about herself
now that she was surprised.

"Oh, I see what you mean," she added after a moment. A picture - 
another picture - had swum to the surface. There was Delia standing
in the middle of the room; Oh my God! Oh my God! she was saying; a
hansom cab had stopped at the house next door; and she herself was
watching Morris - was it Morris? - going down the street to post a
letter. . . . She was silent. I do not want to go back into my
past, she was thinking. I want the present.

"Where's he taking us?" she said, looking out. They had reached
the public part of London; the illuminated. The light fell on
broad pavements; on white brilliantly lit-up public offices; on a
pallid, hoary-looking church. Advertisements popped in and out.
Here was a bottle of beer: it poured: then stopped: then poured
again. They had reached the theatre quarter. There was the usual
garish confusion. Men and women in evening dress were walking in
the middle of the road. Cabs were wheeling and stopping. Their
own taxi was held up. It stopped dead under a statue: the lights
shone on its cadaverous pallor.

"Always reminds me of an advertisement of sanitary towels," said
Peggy, glancing at the figure of a woman in nurse's uniform holding
out her hand.

Eleanor was shocked for a moment. A knife seemed to slice her
skin, leaving a ripple of unpleasant sensation; but what was solid
in her body it did not touch, she realised after a moment. That
she said because of Charles, she thought, feeling the bitterness in
her tone - her brother, a nice dull boy who had been killed.

"The only fine thing that was said in the war," she said aloud,
reading the words cut on the pedestal.

"It didn't  come to much," said Peggy sharply.

The cab remained fixed in the block.

The pause seemed to hold them in the light of some thought that
they both wished to put away.

"Don't  people wear pretty clothes nowadays?" said Eleanor, pointing
to another girl with fair hair in a long bright cloak and another
young man in evening dress.

"Yes," said Peggy briefly.

But why don't  you enjoy yourself more? Eleanor said to herself.
Her brother's death had been very sad, but she had always found
North much the more interesting of the two. The cab threaded its
way through the traffic and passed into a back street. He was
stopped now by a red light. "It's nice, having North back again,"
Eleanor said.

"Yes," said Peggy. "He says we talk of nothing but money and
politics," she added. She finds fault with him because he was not
the one to be killed; but that's wrong, Eleanor thought.

"Does he?" she said. "But then . . ." A newspaper placard, with
large black letters, seemed to finish her sentence for her. They
were approaching the square in which Delia lived. She began to
fumble with her purse. She looked at the metre which had mounted
rather high. The man was going the long way round.

"He'll find his way in time," she said. They were gliding slowly
round the square. She waited patiently, holding her purse in her
hand. She saw a breadth of dark sky over the roofs. The sun had
sunk. For a moment the sky had the quiet look of the sky that lies
above fields and woods in the country.

"He'll have to turn, that's all," she said. "I'm not despondent,"
she added, as the taxi turned. "Travelling, you see: when one has
to mix up with all sorts of other people on board ship, or in one
of those little places where one has to stay - off the beaten track - "
The taxi was sliding tentatively past house after house - "You
ought to go there, Peggy," she broke off; "you ought to travel:
the natives are so beautiful you know; half naked: going down to
the river in the moonlight; - that's the house over there - " She
tapped on the window - the taxi slowed down. "What was I saying?
I'm not despondent, no, because people are so kind, so good at
heart. . . . So that if only ordinary people, ordinary people like
ourselves . . ."

The cab drew up at a house whose windows were lit up. Peggy leant
forward and opened the door. She jumped out and paid the driver.
Eleanor bundled out after her. "No, no, no, Peggy," she began.

"It's my cab. It's my cab," Peggy protested.

"But I insist on paying my share," said Eleanor, opening her purse.



"That's Eleanor," said North. He left the telephone and turned to
Sara. She was still swinging her foot up and down.

"She told me to tell you to come to Delia's party," he said.

"To Delia's party? Why to Delia's party?" she asked.

"Because they're old and want you to come," he said, standing over
her.

"Old Eleanor; wandering Eleanor; Eleanor with the wild eyes . . ."
she mused. "Shall I, shan't  I, shall I, shan't  I?" she hummed,
looking up at him. "No," she said, putting her feet to the ground,
"I shan't ."

"You must," he said. For her manner irritated him - Eleanor's voice
was still in his ears.

"I must, must I?" she said, making the coffee.

"Then," she said, giving him his cup and picking up the book at the
same time, "read until we must go."

She curled herself up again, holding her cup in her hand.

It was still early, it was true. But why, he thought as he opened
the book again and turned over the pages, won't  she come? Is she
afraid? he wondered. He looked at her crumpled in her chair. Her
dress was shabby. He looked at the book again, but he could hardly
see to read. She had not lit the lamp.

"I can't  see to read without a light," he said. It grew dark soon
in this street; the houses were so close. Now a car passed and a
light slid across the ceiling.

"Shall I turn on the light?" she asked.

"No," he said. "I'll try to remember something." He began to say
aloud the only poem he knew by heart. As he spoke the words out
into the semi-darkness they sounded extremely beautiful, he
thought, because they could not see each other, perhaps.

He paused at the end of the verse.

"Go on," she said.

He began again. The words going out into the room seemed like
actual presences, hard and independent; yet as she was listening
they were changed by their contact with her. But as he reached the
end of the second verse - 


 Society is all but rude - 
 To this delicious solitude . . .


he heard a sound. Was it in the poem or outside of it, he
wondered? Inside, he thought, and was about to go on, when she
raised her hand. He stopped. He heard heavy footsteps outside the
door. Was someone coming in? Her eyes were on the door.

"The Jew," she murmured.

"The Jew?" he said. They listened. He could hear quite distinctly
now. Somebody was turning on taps; somebody was having a bath in
the room opposite.

"The Jew having a bath," she said.

"The Jew having a bath?" he repeated.

"And tomorrow there'll be a line of grease round the bath," she
said.

"Damn the Jew!" he exclaimed. The thought of a line of grease from
a strange man's body on the bath next door disgusted him.

"Go on - " said Sara: "Society is all but rude," she repeated the
last lines, "to this delicious solitude."

"No," he said.

They listened to the water running. The man was coughing and
clearing his throat as he sponged.

"Who is this Jew?" he asked.

"Abrahamson, in the tallow trade," she said.

They listened.

"Engaged to a pretty girl in a tailor's shop," she added.

They could hear the sounds through the thin walls very distinctly.

He was snorting as he sponged himself.

"But he leaves hairs in the bath," she concluded.

North felt a shiver run through him. Hairs in food, hairs on
basins, other people's hairs made him feel physically sick.

"D'you share a bath with him?" he asked.

She nodded.

He made a noise like "Pah!"

"'Pah.' That's what I said," she laughed. "'Pah!' - when I went
into the bathroom on a cold winter's morning - 'Pah!' - she threw her
hand out - "'Pah!'" She paused.

"And then - ?" he asked.

"And then," she said, sipping her coffee, "I came back into the
sitting-room. And breakfast was waiting. Fried eggs and a bit of
toast. Lydia with her blouse torn and her hair down. The
unemployed singing hymns under the window. And I said to myself - "
she flung her hand out, "'Polluted city, unbelieving city, city of
dead fish and worn-out frying-pans' - thinking of a river's bank,
when the tide's out," she explained.

"Go on," he nodded.

"So I put on my hat and coat and rushed out in a rage," she
continued, "and stood on the bridge, and said, 'Am I a weed,
carried this way, that way, on a tide that comes twice a day
without a meaning?'"

"Yes?" he prompted her.

"And there were people passing; the strutting; the tiptoeing; the
pasty; the ferret-eyed; the bowler-hatted, servile innumerable army
of workers. And I said, 'Must I join your conspiracy? Stain the
hand, the unstained hand,'" - he could see her hand gleam as she
waved it in the half-light of the sitting-room, "' - and sign on,
and serve a master; all because of a Jew in my bath, all because of
a Jew?'"

She sat up and laughed, excited by the sound of her own voice which
had run in to a jog-trot rhythm.

"Go on, go on," he said.

"But I had a talisman, a glowing gem, a lucent emerald" - she picked
up an envelope that lay on the floor - "a letter of introduction.
And I said to the flunkey in peach-blossom trousers, 'Admit me,
sirrah,' and he led me along corridors piled with purple till I
came to a door, a mahogany door, and knocked; and a voice said,
'Enter.' And what did I find?" She paused. "A stout man with red
cheeks. On his table three orchids in a vase. Pressed into your
hand, I thought, as the car crunches the gravel by your wife at
parting. And over the fireplace the usual picture - "

"Stop!" North interrupted her. "You have come to an office," he
tapped the table. "You are presenting a letter of introduction - 
but to whom?"

"Oh, to whom?" she laughed. "To a man in sponge-bag trousers. 'I
knew your father at Oxford,' he said, toying with the blotting-
paper, ornamented in one corner with a cartwheel. But what do YOU
find insoluble, I asked him, looking at the mahogany man, the
clean-shaven, rosy-gilled, mutton-fed man - "

"The man in a newspaper office," North checked her, "who knew your
father. And then?"

"There was a humming and a grinding. The great machines went
round; and little boys popped in with elongated sheets; black
sheets; smudged; damp with printer's ink. 'Pardon me a moment,' he
said, and made a note in the margin. But the Jew's in my bath, I
said - the Jew . . . the Jew - " She stopped suddenly and emptied
her glass.

Yes, he thought, there's the voice; there's the attitude; and the
reflection in other people's faces; but then there's something
true - in the silence perhaps. But it was not silent. They could
hear the Jew thudding in the bathroom; he seemed to stagger from
foot to foot as he dried himself. Now he unlocked the door, and
they heard him go upstairs. The pipes began to give forth hollow
gurgling sounds.

"How much of that was true?" he asked her. But she had lapsed into
silence. The actual words he supposed - the actual words floated
together and formed a sentence in his mind - meant that she was
poor; that she must earn her living, but the excitement with which
she had spoken, due to wine perhaps, had created yet another
person; another semblance, which one must solidify into one whole.

The house was quiet now, save for the sound of the bath water
running away. A watery pattern fluctuated on the ceiling. The
street lamps jiggering up and down outside made the houses opposite
a curious pale red. The uproar of the day had died away; no carts
were rattling down the street. The vegetable-sellers, the organ-
grinders, the woman practising her scales, the man playing the
trombone, had all trundled away their barrows, pulled down their
shutters, and closed the lids of their pianos. It was so still
that for a moment North thought he was in Africa, sitting on the
verandah in the moonlight; but he roused himself. "What about this
party?" he said. He got up and threw away his cigarette. He
stretched himself and looked at his watch. "It's time to go," he
said. "Go and get ready," he urged her. For if one went to a
party, he thought, it was absurd to go just as people were leaving.
And the party must have begun.



"What were you saying - what were you saying, Nell?" said Peggy, in
order to distract Eleanor from paying her share of the cab, as they
stood on the doorstep. "Ordinary people - ordinary people ought to
do what?" she asked.

Eleanor was still fumbling with her purse and did not answer.

"No, I can't  allow that," she said. "Here, take this - "

But Peggy brushed aside the hand, and the coins rolled on the
doorstep. They both stooped simultaneously and their heads
collided.

"Don't  bother," said Eleanor as a coin rolled away. "It was all my
fault." The maid was holding the door open.

"And where do we take our cloaks off?" she said. "In here?"

They went into a room on the ground floor which, though an office,
had been arranged so that it could be used as a cloak-room. There
was a looking-glass on the table: and in front of it trays of pins
and combs and brushes. She went up to the glass and gave herself
one brief glance.

"What a gipsy I look!" she said, and ran a comb through her hair.
"Burnt as brown as a nigger!" Then she gave way to Peggy and
waited.

"I wonder if this was the room . . ." she said.

"What room?" said Peggy abstractedly: she was attending to her
face.

". . . where we used to meet," said Eleanor. She looked about her.
It was still used as an office apparently; but now there were
house-agents' placards on the wall.

"I wonder if Kitty'll come tonight," she mused.

Peggy was gazing into the glass and did not answer.

"She doesn't  often come to town now. Only for weddings and
christenings and so on," Eleanor continued.

Peggy was drawing a line with a tube of some sort round her lips.

"Suddenly you meet a young man six-foot-two and you realise this is
the baby," Eleanor went on.

Peggy was still absorbed in her face.

"D'you have to do that fresh every time?" said Eleanor.

"I should look a fright if I didn't ," said Peggy. The tightness
round her lips and eyes seemed to her visible. She had never felt
less in the mood for a party.

"Oh, how kind of you . . ." Eleanor broke off. The maid had
brought in a sixpence.

"Now, Peggy," said she, proffering the coin, "let me pay my share."

"Don't  be an ass," said Peggy, brushing away her hand.

"But it was my cab," Eleanor insisted. Peggy walked on. "Because
I hate going to parties," Eleanor continued, following her, still
holding out the coin, "on the cheap. You don't  remember your
grandfather? He always said, 'Don't  spoil a good ship for a
ha'porth of tar.' If you went shopping with him," she went on as
they began mounting the stairs, "'Show me the very best thing
you've  got,' he'd say."

"I remember him," said Peggy.

"Do you?" said Eleanor. She was pleased that anyone should
remember her father. "They've  lent these rooms, I suppose," she
added as they walked upstairs. Doors were open. "That's a
solicitor's," she said, looking at some deed-boxes with white names
painted on them.

"Yes, I see what you mean about painting - making-up," she
continued, glancing at her niece. "You do look nice. You look
lit-up. I like it on young people. Not for myself. I should feel
bedizened - bedizzened? - how d'you pronounce it? And what am I to
do with these coppers if you won't  take them? I ought to have left
them in my bag downstairs." They mounted higher and higher. "I
suppose they've  opened all these rooms," she continued - they had
now reached a strip of red carpet - 'so that if Delia's little room
gets too full - but of course the party's hardly begun yet. We're
early. Everybody's upstairs. I hear them talking. Come along.
Shall I go first?"

A babble of voices sounded behind a door. A maid intercepted them.

"Miss Pargiter," said Eleanor.

"Miss Pargiter!" the maid called out, opening the door.



"Go and get ready," said North. He crossed the room and fumbled
with the switch.

He touched the switch, and the electric light in the middle of the
room came on. The shade had been taken off, and a cone of greenish
paper had been twisted round it.

"Go and get ready," he repeated. Sara did not answer. She had
pulled a book towards her and pretended to read it.

"He's killed the king," she said. "So what'll he do next?" She
held her finger between the pages of the book and looked up at him;
a device, he knew, to put off the moment of action. He did not
want to go either. Still, if Eleanor wanted them to go - he
hesitated, looking at his watch.

"What'll he do next?" she repeated.

"Comedy," he said briefly, "Contrast," he said, remembering
something he had read. "The only form of continuity," he added at
a venture.

"Well, go on reading," she said, handing him the book.

He opened it at random.

"The scene is a rocky island in the middle of the sea," he said.
He paused.

Always before reading he had to arrange the scene; to let this
sink; that come forward. A rocky island in the middle of the sea,
he said to himself - there were green pools, tufts of silver grass,
sand, and far away the soft sigh of waves breaking. He opened his
mouth to read. Then there was a sound behind him; a presence - in
the play or in the room? He looked up.

"Maggie!" Sara exclaimed. There she was standing at the open door
in evening dress.



"Were you asleep?" she said, coming into the room. "We've  been
ringing and ringing."

She stood smiling at them, amused, as if she had wakened sleepers.

"Why d'you trouble to have a bell when it's always broken?" said a
man who stood behind her.

North rose. At first he scarcely remembered them. The surface
sight was strange on top of his memory of them, as he had seen them
years ago.

"The bells don't  ring, and the taps don't  run," he said, awkwardly.
"Or they don't  stop running," he added, for the bath water was
still gurgling in the pipes.

"Luckily the door was open," said Maggie. She stood at the table
looking at the broken apple peel and the dish of fly-blown fruit.
Some beauty, North thought, withers; some, he looked at her, grows
more beautiful with age. Her hair was grey; her children must be
grown up now, he supposed. But why do women purse their lips up
when they look in the glass? he wondered. She was looking in the
glass. She was pursing her lips. Then she crossed the room, and
sat down in the chair by the fireplace.

"And why has Renny been crying?" said Sara. North looked at him.
There were wet marks on either side of his large nose.

"Because we've  been to a very bad play," he said, "and should like
something to drink," he added.

Sara went to the cupboard and began clinking glasses. "Were you
reading?" said Renny, looking at the book which had fallen on the
floor.

"We were on a rocky island in the middle of the sea," said Sara,
putting the glasses on the table. Renny began to pour out whisky.

Now I remember him, North thought. Last time they had met was
before he went to the war. It was in a little house in
Westminster. They had sat in front of the fire. And a child had
played with a spotted horse. And he had envied them their
happiness. And they had talked about science. And Renny had said,
"I help them to make shells," and a mask had come down over his
face. A man who made shells; a man who loved peace; a man of
science; a man who cried. . . .

"Stop!" cried Renny. "Stop!" Sara had spurted the soda water over
the table.

"When did you get back?" Renny asked him, taking his glass and
looking at him with eyes still wet with tears.

"About a week ago," he said.

"You've  sold your farm?" said Renny. He sat down with his glass in
his hand.

"Yes, sold it," said North. "Whether I shall stay, or go back," he
said, taking his glass and raising it to his lips, "I don't  know."

"Where was your farm?" said Renny, bending towards him. And they
talked about Africa.



Maggie looked at them drinking and talking. The twisted cone of
paper over the electric light was oddly stained. The mottled light
made their faces look greenish. The two grooves on each side of
Renny's nose were still wet. His face was all peaks and hollows;
North's face was round and snub-nosed and rather blueish about the
lips. She gave her chair a little push so that she got the two
heads in relation side by side. They were very different. And as
they talked about Africa their faces changed, as if some twitch had
been given to the fine network under the skin and the weights fell
into different sockets. A thrill ran through her as if the weights
in her own body had changed too. But there was something about the
light that puzzled her. She looked round. A lamp must be flaring
in the street outside. Its light, flickering up and down, mixed
with the electric light under the greenish cone of mottled paper.
It was that which. . . . She started; a voice had reached her.

"To Africa?" she said, looking at North.

"To Delia's party," he said. "I asked if you were coming. . . ."
She had not been listening.

"One moment . . ." Renny interrupted. He held up his hand like a
policeman stopping traffic. And again they went on, talking about
Africa.

Maggie lay back in her chair. Behind their heads rose the curve of
the mahogany chair back. And behind the curve of the chair back
was a crinkled glass with a red lip; then there was the straight
line of the mantelpiece with little black-and-white squares on it;
and then three rods ending in soft yellow plumes. She ran her eye
from thing to thing. In and out it went, collecting, gathering,
summing up into one whole, when, just as she was about to complete
the pattern, Renny exclaimed:

"We must - we must!"

He had got up. He had pushed away his glass of whisky. He stood
there like somebody commanding a troop, North thought; so emphatic
was his voice, so commanding his gesture. Yet it was only a
question of going round to an old woman's party. Or was there
always, he thought, as he too rose and looked for his hat,
something that came to the surface, inappropriately, unexpectedly,
from the depths of people, and made ordinary actions, ordinary
words, expressive of the whole being, so that he felt, as he turned
to follow Renny to Delia's party, as if he were riding to the
relief of a besieged garrison across a desert?

He stopped with his hand on the door. Sara had come in from the
bedroom. She had changed; she was in evening dress; there was
something odd about her - perhaps it was the effect of the evening
dress estranging her?

"I am ready," she said, looking at them.

She stooped and picked up the book that North had let fall.

"We must go - " she said, turning to her sister.

She put the book on the table; she gave it a sad little pat as she
shut it.

"We must go," she repeated, and followed them down the stairs.

Maggie rose. She gave one more look at the cheap lodging-house
room. There was the pampas grass in its terra-cotta pot; the green
vase with the crinkled lip; and the mahogany chair. On the dinner
table lay the dish of fruit; the heavy sensual apples lay side by
side with the yellow spotted bananas. It was an odd combination - 
the round and the tapering, the rosy and the yellow. She switched
off the light. The room now was almost dark, save for a watery
pattern fluctuating on the ceiling. In this phantom evanescent
light only the outlines showed; ghostly apples, ghostly bananas,
and the spectre of a chair. Colour was slowly returning, as her
eyes grew used to the darkness, and substance. . . . She stood
there for a moment looking. Then a voice shouted:

"Maggie! Maggie!"

"I'm coming!" she cried, and followed them down the stairs.



"And your name, miss?" said the maid to Peggy as she hung back
behind Eleanor.

"Miss Margaret Pargiter," said Peggy.

"Miss Margaret Pargiter!" the maid called out into the room.

There was a babble of voices; lights opened brightly in front of
her, and Delia came forward. "Oh, Peggy!" she exclaimed. "How
nice of you to come!"

She went in; but she felt plated, coated over with some cold skin.
They had come too early - the room was almost empty. Only a few
people stood about, talking too loudly, as if to fill the room.
Making believe, Peggy thought to herself as she shook hands with
Delia and passed on, that something pleasant is about to happen.
She saw with extreme clearness the Persian rug and the carved
fireplace, but there was an empty space in the middle of the room.

What is the tip for this particular situation? she asked herself,
as if she were prescribing for a patient. Take notes, she added.
Do them up in a bottle with a glossy green cover, she thought.
Take notes and the pain goes. Take notes and the pain goes, she
repeated to herself as she stood there alone. Delia hurried past
her. She was talking, but talking at random.

"It's all very well for you people who live in London - " she was
saying. But the nuisance of taking notes of what people say, Peggy
went on as Delia passed her, is that they talk such nonsense . . .
such complete nonsense, she thought, drawing herself back against
the wall. Here her father came in. He paused at the door; put his
head up as if he were looking for someone, and advanced with his
hand out.

And what's this? she asked, for the sight of her father in his
rather worn shoes had given her a direct spontaneous feeling. This
sudden warm spurt? she asked, examining it. She watched him cross
the room. His shoes always affected her strangely. Part sex; part
pity, she thought. Can one call it "love"? But she forced herself
to move. Now that I have drugged myself into a state of
comparative insensibility, she said to herself, I will walk across
the room boldly; I will go to Uncle Patrick, who is standing by the
sofa picking his teeth, and I will say to him - what shall I say?

A sentence suggested itself for no rhyme or reason as she crossed
the room: "How's the man who cut his toes off with the hatchet?"

"How's the man who cut his toes off with the hatchet?" she said,
speaking the words exactly as she thought them. The handsome old
Irishman bent down, for he was very tall, and hollowed his hand,
for he was hard of hearing.

"Hacket? Hacket?" he repeated. She smiled. The steps from brain
to brain must be cut very shallow, if thought is to mount them, she
noted.

"Cut his toes off with the hatchet when I was staying with you,"
she said. She remembered how when she last stayed with them in
Ireland the gardener had cut his foot with a hatchet.

"Hacket? Hacket?" he repeated. He looked puzzled. Then
understanding dawned.

"Oh, the Hackets!" he said. "Dear old Peter Hacket - yes." It
seemed that there were Hackets in Galway, and the mistake, which
she did not trouble to explain, was all to the good, for it set him
off, and he told her stories about the Hackets as they sat side by
side on the sofa.

A grown woman, she thought, crosses London to talk to a deaf old
man about the Hackets, whom she's never heard of, when she meant to
ask after the gardener who cut his toe off with a hatchet. But
does it matter? Hackets or hatchets? She laughed, happily in time
with a joke, so that it seemed appropriate. But one wants somebody
to laugh with, she thought. Pleasure is increased by sharing it.
Does the same hold good of pain? she mused. Is that the reason why
we all talk so much of ill-health - because sharing things lessens
things? Give pain, give pleasure an outer body, and by increasing
the surface diminish them. . . . But the thought slipped. He was
off telling his old stories. Gently, methodically, like a man
setting in motion some still serviceable but rather weary nag, he
was off remembering old days, old dogs, old memories that slowly
shaped themselves, as he warmed, into little figures of country
house life. She fancied as she half listened that she was looking
at a faded snapshot of cricketers; of shooting parties on the many
steps of some country mansion.

How many people, she wondered, listen? This 'sharing," then, is a
bit of a farce. She made herself attend.

"Ah yes, those were fine old days!" he was saying. The light came
into his faded eyes.

She looked once more at the snapshot of the men in gaiters, and the
women in flowing skirts on the broad white steps with the dogs
curled up at their feet. But he was off again.

"Did you ever hear from your father of a man called Roddy Jenkins
who lived in the little white house on the right-hand side as you
go along the road?" he asked. "But you must know that story?" he
added.

"No," she said, screwing up her eyes as if she referred to the
files of memory. "Tell me."

And he told her the story.

I'm good, she thought, at fact-collecting. But what makes up a
person - ,  she hollowed her hand , the circumference, - no, I'm not
good at that. There was her Aunt Delia. She watched her moving
quickly about the room. What do I know about her? That she's
wearing a dress with gold spots; has wavy hair, that was red, is
white; is handsome; ravaged; with a past. But what past? She
married Patrick. . . . The long story that Patrick was telling her
kept breaking up the surface of her mind like oars dipping into
water. Nothing could settle. There was a lake in the story too,
for it was a story about duck-shooting.

She married Patrick, she thought, looking at his battered weather-
worn face with the single hairs on it. Why did Delia marry
Patrick? she wondered. How do they manage it - love, childbirth?
The people who touch each other and go up in a cloud of smoke: red
smoke? His face reminded her of the red skin of a gooseberry with
the little stray hairs. But none of the lines on his face was
sharp enough, she thought, to explain how they came together and
had three children. They were lines that came from shooting; lines
that came from worry; for the old days were over, he was saying.
They had to cut things down.

"Yes, we're all finding that," she said perfunctorily. She turned
her wrist cautiously so that she could read her watch. Fifteen
minutes only had passed. But the room was filling with people she
did not know. There was an Indian in a pink turban.

"Ah, but I'm boring you with these old stories," said her uncle,
wagging his head. He was hurt, she felt.

"No, no, no!" she said, feeling uncomfortable. He was off again,
but out of good manners this time, she felt. Pain must outbalance
pleasure by two parts to one, she thought; in all social relations.
Or am I the exception, the peculiar person? she continued, for the
others seemed happy enough. Yes, she thought, looking straight
ahead of her, and feeling again the stretched skin round her lips
and eyes tight from the tiredness of sitting up late with a woman
in childbirth, I'm the exception; hard; cold; in a groove already;
merely a doctor.

Getting out of grooves is damned unpleasant, she thought, before
the chill of death has set in, like bending frozen boots. . . .
She bent her head to listen. To smile, to bend, to make believe
you're amused when you're bored, how painful it is, she thought.
All ways, every way's painful, she thought; staring at the Indian
in the pink turban.

"Who's that fellow?" Patrick asked, nodding his head in his
direction.

"One of Eleanor's Indians I expect," she said aloud, and thought,
If only the merciful powers of darkness would obliterate the
external exposure of the sensitive nerve and I could get up
and. . . . There was a pause.

"But I mustn't  keep you here, listening to my old stories," said
Uncle Patrick. His weather-beaten nag with the broken knees had
stopped.

"But tell me, does old Biddy still keep the little shop," she
asked, "where we used to buy sweets?"

"Poor old body - " he began. He was off again. All her patients
said that, she thought. Rest - rest - let me rest. How to deaden;
how to cease to feel; that was the cry of the woman bearing
children; to rest, to cease to be. In the Middle Ages, she
thought, it was the cell; the monastery; now it's the laboratory;
the professions; not to live; not to feel; to make money, always
money, and in the end, when I'm old and worn like a horse, no, it's
a cow. . . - for part of old Patrick's story had imposed itself upon
her mind: ". . . for there's no sale for the beasts at all," he was
saying, "no sale at all. Ah, there's Julia Cromarty - " he
exclaimed, and waved his hand, his large loose-jointed hand, at a
charming compatriot.

She was left sitting alone on the sofa. For her uncle rose and
went off with both hands outstretched to greet the bird-like old
woman who had come in chattering.

She was left alone. She was glad to be alone. She had no wish to
talk. But next moment somebody stood beside her. It was Martin.
He sat down beside her. She changed her attitude completely.

"Hullo, Martin!" she greeted him cordially.

"Done your duty by the old mare, Peggy?" he said. He referred to
the stories that old Patrick always told them.

"Did I look very glum?" she asked.

"Well," he said, glancing at her, "not exactly enraptured."

"One knows the end of his stories by now," she excused herself,
looking at Martin. He had taken to brushing his hair up like a
waiter's. He never looked her fully in the face. He never felt
entirely at his ease with her. She was his doctor; she knew that
he dreaded cancer. She must try to distract him from thinking,
Does she see any symptoms?

"I was wondering how they came to marry," she said. "Were they in
love?" She spoke at random to distract him.

"Of course he was in love," he said. He looked at Delia. She was
standing by the fireplace talking to the Indian. She was still a
very handsome woman, with her presence, with her gestures.

"We were all in love," he said, glancing sideways at Peggy. The
younger generation were so serious.

"Oh, of course," she said, smiling. She liked his eternal pursuit
of one love after another love - his gallant clutch upon the flying
tail, the slippery tail of youth - even he, even now.

"But you," he said, stretching his feet out, hitching up his
trousers, "your generation I mean - you miss a great deal . . . you
miss a great deal," he repeated. She waited.

"Loving only your own sex," he added.

He liked to assert his own youth in that way, she thought; to say
things that he thought up to date.

"I'm not that generation," she said.

"Well, well, well," he chuckled, shrugging his shoulder and
glancing at her sideways. He knew very little about her private
life. But she looked serious; she looked tired. She works too
hard, he thought.

"I'm getting on," said Peggy. "Getting into a groove. So Eleanor
told me tonight."

Or was it she, on the other hand, who had told Eleanor she was
'suppressed"? One or the other.

"Eleanor's a gay old dog," he said. "Look!" He pointed.

There she was, talking to the Indian in her red cloak.

"Just back from India," he added. "A present from Bengal, eh?" he
said, referring to the cloak.

"And next year she's off to China," said Peggy.

"But Delia - " she asked; Delia was passing them. "Was she in
love?"  What you in your generation called "in love," she added to
herself. 

He wagged his head from side to side and pursed his lips. He
always liked his little joke, she remembered.

"I don't  know - I don't  know about Delia," he said. "There was the
cause, you know - what she called in those days The Cause." He
screwed his face up. "Ireland, you know. Parnell. Ever heard of
a man called Parnell?" he asked.

"Yes," said Peggy.

"And Edward?" she added. He had come in; he looked very
distinguished, too, in his elaborate, if conscious simplicity.

"Edward - yes," said Martin. "Edward was in love. Surely you know
that old story - Edward and Kitty?"

"The one who married - what was his name? - Lasswade?" Peggy murmured
as Edward passed them.

"Yes, she married the other man - Lasswade. But he was in love - he
was very much in love," Martin murmured. "But you," he gave her a
quick little glance. There was something in her that chilled him.
"Of course, you have your profession," he added. He looked at the
ground. He was thinking of his dread of cancer, she supposed. He
was afraid that she had noted some symptom.

"Oh, doctors are great humbugs," she threw out at random.

"Why? People live longer than they used, don't  they?" he said.
"They don't  die so painfully anyhow," he added.

"We've  learnt a few little tricks," she conceded. He stared ahead
of him with a look that moved her pity.

"You'll live to be eighty - if you want to live to be eighty," she
said. He looked at her.

"Of course I'm all in favour of living to be eighty!" he exclaimed.
"I want to go to America. I want to see their buildings. I'm on
that side, you see. I enjoy life." He did, enormously.

He must be over sixty himself, she supposed. But he was
wonderfully got up; as sprig and spruce as a man of forty, with his
canary-coloured lady in Kensington.

"I don't  know," she said aloud.

"Come, Peggy, come," he said. "Don't  tell me you don't  enjoy - 
here's Rose."

Rose came up. She had grown very stout.

"Don't  you want to be eighty?" he said to her. He had to say it
twice over. She was deaf.

"I do. Of course I do!" she said when she understood him. She
faced them. She made an odd angle with her head thrown back, Peggy
thought, as if she were a military man.

"Of course I do," she said, sitting down abruptly on the sofa
beside them.

"Ah, but then - " Peggy began. She paused. Rose was deaf, she
remembered. She had to shout. "People hadn't  made such fools of
themselves in your day," she shouted. But she doubted if Rose
heard.

"I want to see what's going to happen," said Rose. "We live in a
very interesting world," she added.

"Nonsense," Martin teased her. "You want to live," he bawled in
her ear, "because you enjoy living."

"And I'm not ashamed of it," she said. "I like my kind - on the
whole."

"What you like is fighting them," he bawled.

"D'you think you can get a rise out of me at this time o' day?" she
said, tapping him on the arm.

Now they'll talk about being children; climbing trees in the back
garden, thought Peggy, and how they shot somebody's cats. Each
person had a certain line laid down in their minds, she thought,
and along it came the same old sayings. One's mind must be
crisscrossed like the palm of one's hand, she thought, looking at
the palm of her hand.

"She always was a spitfire," said Martin, turning to Peggy.

"And they always put the blame on me," Rose said. "HE had the
school-room. Where was I to sit? 'Oh, run away and play in the
nursery!'" she waved her hand.

"And so she went into the bathroom and cut her wrist with a knife,"
Martin jeered.

"No, that was Erridge: that was about the microscope," she
corrected him.

It's like a kitten catching its tail, Peggy thought; round and
round they go in a circle. But it's what they enjoy, she thought;
it's what they come to parties for. Martin went on teasing Rose.

"And where's your red ribbon?" he was asking.

Some decoration had been given her, Peggy remembered, for her work
in the war.

"Aren't  we worthy to see you in your war paint?" he teased her.

"This fellow's jealous," she said, turning to Peggy again. "He's
never done a stroke of work in his life."

"I work - I work," Martin insisted. "I sit in an office all day
long - "

"Doing what?" said Rose.

Then they became suddenly silent. That turn was over - the old-
brother-and-sister turn. Now they could only go back and repeat
the same thing over again.

"Look here," said Martin, "we must go and do our duty." He rose.
They parted.



"Doing what?" Peggy repeated, as she crossed the room. "Doing
what?" she repeated. She was feeling reckless; nothing that she
did mattered. She walked to the window and twitched the curtain
apart. There were the stars pricked in little holes in the blue-
black sky. There was a row of chimney-pots against the sky. Then
the stars. Inscrutable, eternal, indifferent - those were the
words; the right words. But I don't  feel it, she said, looking at
the stars. So why pretend to? What they're really like, she
thought, screwing up her eyes to look at them, is little bits of
frosty steel. And the moon - there it was - is a polished dish-
cover. But she felt nothing, even when she had reduced moon and
stars to that. Then she turned and found herself face to face with
a young man she thought she knew but could not put a name to. He
had a fine brow, but a receding chin and he was pale, pasty.

"How-d'you-do?" she said. Was his name Leacock or Laycock?

"Last time we met," she said, "was at the races." She connected
him, incongruously, with a Cornish field, stone walls, farmers and
rough ponies jumping.

"No, that's Paul," he said. "My brother Paul." He was tart about
it. What did he do, then, that made him superior in his own esteem
to Paul?

"You live in London?" she said.

He nodded.

"You write?" she hazarded. But why, because he was a writer - she
remembered now seeing his name in the papers - throw your head back
when you say "Yes"? She preferred Paul; he looked healthy; this
one had a queer face; knit up; nerve-drawn; fixed.

"Poetry?" she said.

"Yes." But why bite off that word as if it were a cherry on the
end of a stalk? she thought. There was nobody coming; they were
bound to sit down side by side, on chairs by the wall.

"How do you manage, if you're in an office?" she said. Apparently
in his spare time.

"My uncle," he began. ". . . You've  met him?"

Yes, a nice commonplace man; he had been very kind to her about a
passport once. This boy, of course, though she only half listened,
sneered at him. Then why go into his office? she asked herself.
My people, he was saying . . . hunted. Her attention wandered.
She had heard it all before. I, I, I - he went on. It was like a
vulture's beak pecking, or a vacuum-cleaner sucking, or a telephone
bell ringing. I, I, I. But he couldn't  help it, not with that
nerve-drawn egotist's face, she thought, glancing at him. He could
not free himself, could not detach himself. He was bound on the
wheel with tight iron hoops. He had to expose, had to exhibit.
But why let him? she thought, as he went on talking. For what do I
care about his "I, I, I"? Or his poetry? Let me shake him off
then, she said to herself, feeling like a person whose blood has
been sucked, leaving all the nerve-centres pale. She paused. He
noted her lack of sympathy. He thought her stupid, she supposed.

"I'm tired," she apologised. "I've  been up all night," she
explained. "I'm a doctor - "

The fire went out of his face when she said "I." That's done it - 
now he'll go, she thought. He can't  be "you" - he must be "I." She
smiled. For up he got and off he went.



She turned round and stood at the window. Poor little wretch, she
thought; atrophied, withered; cold as steel; hard as steel; bald as
steel. And I too, she thought, looking at the sky. The stars
seemed pricked haphazard in the sky, except that there, to the
right over the chimney-pots, hung that phantom wheel-barrow - what
did they call it? The name escaped her. I will count them, she
thought, returning to her notebook, and had begun one, two, three,
four . . . when a voice exclaimed behind her: "Peggy! Aren't  your
ears tingling?" She turned. It was Delia of course, with her
genial ways, her imitation Irish flattery: " - because they ought to
be," said Delia, laying a hand on her shoulder, "considering what
HE'S been saying" - she pointed to a grey-haired man - "what praises
he's been singing of you."

Peggy looked where she pointed. There was her teacher over there,
her master. Yes, she knew he thought her clever. She was, she
supposed. They all said so. Very clever.

"He's been telling me - " Delia began. But she broke off.

"Just help me open this window," she said. "It's getting hot."

"Let me," said Peggy. She gave the window a jerk, but it stuck,
for it was old and the frames did not fit.

"Here, Peggy," said somebody, coming behind her. It was her
father. His hand was on the window, his hand with the scar. He
pushed; the window went up.

"Thanks, Morris, that's better," said Delia. "I was telling Peggy
her ears ought to be tingling," she began again: "'My most
brilliant pupil!' That's what HE said," Delia went on. "I assure
you I felt quite proud. 'But she's my niece,' I said. He hadn't 
known it - "

There, said Peggy, that's pleasure. The nerve down her spine
seemed to tingle as the praise reached her father. Each emotion
touched a different nerve. A sneer rasped the thigh; pleasure
thrilled the spine; and also affected the sight. The stars had
softened; they quivered. Her father brushed her shoulder as he
dropped his hand; but neither of them spoke.

"D'you want it open at the bottom too?" he said.

"No, that'll do," said Delia. "The room's getting hot," she said.
"People are beginning to come. They must use the rooms
downstairs," she said. "But who's that out there?" she pointed.
Opposite the house against the railings of the square was a group
in evening dress.

"I think I recognise one of them," said Morris, looking out.
"That's North, isn't  it?"

"Yes, that's North," said Peggy, looking out.

"Then why don't  they come in?" said Delia, tapping on the window.



"But you must come and see it for yourselves," North was saying.
They had asked him to describe Africa. He had said that there were
mountains and plains; it was silent, he had said, and birds sang.
He stopped; it was difficult to describe a place to people who had
not seen it. Then curtains in the house opposite parted, and three
heads appeared at the window. They looked at the heads outlined on
the window opposite them. They were standing with their backs to
the railings of the square. The trees hung dark showers of leaves
over them. The trees had become part of the sky. Now and then
they seemed to shift and shuffle slightly as a breeze went through
them. A star shone among the leaves. It was silent too; the
murmur of the traffic was run together into one far hum. A cat
slunk past; for a second they saw the luminous green of the eyes;
then it was extinguished. The cat crossed the lighted space and
vanished. Someone tapped again on the window and cried, "Come in!"

"Come!" said Renny, and threw his cigar into the bushes behind him.
"Come, we must."



They went upstairs, past the doors of offices, past long windows
that opened on to back gardens that lay behind houses. Trees in
full leaf stretched their branches across at different levels; the
leaves, here bright green in the artificial light, here dark in
shadow, moved up and down in the little breeze. Then they came to
the private part of the house, where the red carpet was laid; and a
roar of voices sounded from behind a door as if a flock of sheep
were penned there. Then music, a dance, swung out.

"Now," said Maggie, pausing for a moment, outside the door. She
gave their names to the servant.

"And you, sir?" said the maid to North, who hung behind.

"Captain Pargiter," said North, touching his tie.

"And Captain Pargiter!" the maid called out.



Delia was upon them instantly. "And Captain Pargiter!" she
exclaimed, as she came hurrying across the room. "How very nice of
you to come!" she exclaimed. She took their hands at random, here
a left hand, there a right hand, in her left hand, in her right
hand.

"I thought it was you," she exclaimed, 'standing in the square. I
thought I could recognise Renny - but I wasn't  sure about North.
Captain Pargiter!" she wrung his hand, "you're quite a stranger - 
but a very welcome one! Now who d'you know? Who don't  you know?"

She glanced round, twitching her shawl rather nervously.

"Let me see, there's all your uncles and aunts; and your cousins;
and your sons and daughters - yes, Maggie, I saw your lovely couple
not long ago. They're somewhere. . . . Only all the generations
in our family are so mixed; cousins and aunts, uncles and brothers - 
but perhaps it's a good thing."

She stopped rather suddenly as if she had used up that vein. She
twitched her shawl.

"They're going to dance," she said, pointing at the young man who
was putting another record on the gramophone. "It's all right for
dancing," she added, referring to the gramophone. "Not for music."
She became simple for a moment. "I can't  bear music on the
gramophone. But dance music - that's another thing. And young
people - don't  you find that? - must dance. It's right they should.
Dance or not - just as you like." She waved her hand.

"Yes, just as you like," her husband echoed her. He stood beside
her, dangling his hands in front of him like a bear on which coats
are hung in a hotel.

"Just as you like," he repeated, shaking his paws.

"Help me to move the tables, North," said Delia. "If they're going
to dance, they'll want everything out of the way - and the rugs
rolled up." She pushed a table out of the way. Then she ran
across the room to whisk a chair against the wall.

Now one of the vases was upset, and a stream of water flowed across
the carpet.

"Don't  mind it, don't  mind it - it doesn't  matter at all!" Delia
exclaimed, assuming the manner of a harum-scarum Irish hostess.
But North stooped and swabbed up the water.

"And what are you going to do with that pocket handkerchief?"
Eleanor asked him; she had joined them in her flowing red cloak.

"Hang it on a chair to dry," said North, walking off.

"And you, Sally?" said Eleanor, drawing back against the wall since
they were going to dance. "Going to dance?" she asked, sitting
down.

"I?" said Sara, yawning. "I want to sleep." She sank down on a
cushion beside Eleanor.

"But you don't  come to parties," Eleanor laughed, looking down at
her, "to sleep, do you?" Again she saw the little picture she had
seen at the end of the telephone. But she could not see her face;
only the top of her head.

"Dining with you, wasn't  he?" she said, as North passed them with
his handkerchief.

"And what did you talk about?" she asked. She saw her, sitting on
the edge of a chair, swinging her foot up and down, with a smudge
on her nose.

"Talk about?" said Sara. "You, Eleanor." People were passing them
all the time; they were brushing against their knees; they were
beginning to dance. It made one feel a little dizzy, Eleanor
thought, sinking back in her chair.

"Me?" she said. "What about me?"

"Your life," said Sara.

"My life?" Eleanor repeated. Couples began to twist and turn
slowly past them. It was a fox-trot that they were dancing, she
supposed.

My life, she said to herself. That was odd, it was the second time
that evening that somebody had talked about her life. And I
haven't  got one, she thought. Oughtn't  a life to be something you
could handle and produce? - a life of seventy odd years. But I've 
only the present moment, she thought. Here she was alive, now,
listening to the fox-trot. Then she looked round. There was
Morris; Rose; Edward with his head thrown back talking to a man she
did not know. I'm the only person here, she thought, who remembers
how he sat on the edge of my bed that night, crying - the night
Kitty's engagement was announced. Yes, things came back to her. A
long strip of life lay behind her. Edward crying, Mrs. Levy
talking; snow falling; a sunflower with a crack in it; the yellow
omnibus trotting along the Bayswater Road. And I thought to
myself, I'm the youngest person in this omnibus; now I'm the
oldest. . . . Millions of things came back to her. Atoms danced
apart and massed themselves. But how did they compose what people
called a life? She clenched her hands and felt the hard little
coins she was holding. Perhaps there's "I" at the middle of it,
she thought; a knot; a centre; and again she saw herself sitting at
her table drawing on the blotting-paper, digging little holes from
which spokes radiated. Out and out they went; thing followed
thing, scene obliterated scene. And then they say, she thought,
"We've  been talking about you!"

"My life . . ." she said aloud, but half to herself.

"Yes?" said Sara, looking up.

Eleanor stopped. She had forgotten her. But there was somebody
listening. Then she must put her thoughts into order; then she
must find words. But no, she thought, I can't  find words; I can't 
tell anybody.

"Isn't  that Nicholas?" she said, looking at a rather large man who
stood in the doorway.

"Where?" said Sara. But she looked in the wrong direction. He had
disappeared. Perhaps she had been mistaken. My life's been other
people's lives, Eleanor thought - my father's; Morris's; my friends'
lives; Nicholas's. . . . Fragments of a conversation with him came
back to her. Either I'd been lunching with him or dining with him,
she thought. It was in a restaurant. There was a parrot with a
pink feather in a cage on the counter. And they had sat there
talking - it was after the war - about the future; about education.
And he wouldn't  let me pay for the wine, she suddenly remembered,
though it was I who ordered it. . . .

Here somebody stopped in front of her. She looked up. "Just as I
was thinking of you!" she exclaimed.

It was Nicholas.

"Good-evening, madame!" he said, bending over her in his foreign
way.

"Just as I was thinking of you!" she repeated. Indeed it was like
a part of her, a sunk part of her, coming to the surface. "Come
and sit beside me," she said, and pulled up a chair.



"D'you know who that chap is, sitting by my aunt?" said North to
the girl he was dancing with. She looked round; but vaguely.

"I don't  know your aunt," she said. "I don't  know anybody here."

The dance was over and they began walking towards the door.

"I don't  even know my hostess," she said. "I wish you'd point her
out to me."

"There - over there," he said. He pointed to Delia in her black
dress with the gold spangles.

"Oh, that," she said, looking at her. "That's my hostess, is it?"
He had not caught the girl's name, and she knew none of them
either. He was glad of it. It made him seem different to himself - 
it stimulated him. He shepherded her towards the door. He wanted
to avoid his relations. In particular he wanted to avoid his
sister Peggy; but there she was, standing alone by the door. He
looked the other way; he conveyed his partner out of the door.
There must be a garden or a roof somewhere, he thought, where they
could sit, alone. She was extraordinarily pretty and young.

"Come along," he said, "downstairs."



"And what were you thinking about me?" said Nicholas, sitting down
beside Eleanor.

She smiled. There he was in his rather ill-assorted dress-clothes,
with the seal engraved with the arms of his mother the princess,
and his swarthy wrinkled face that always made her think of some
loose-skinned, furry animal, savage to others but kind to herself.
But what was she thinking about him? She was thinking of him in
the lump; she could not break off little fragments. The restaurant
had been smoky she remembered.

"How we dined together once in Soho," she said. ". . . d'you
remember?"

"All the evenings with you I remember, Eleanor," he said. But his
glance was a little vague. His attention was distracted. He was
looking at a lady who had just come in; a well-dressed lady, who
stood with her back to the bookcase equipped for every emergency.
If I can't  describe my own life, Eleanor thought, how can I
describe him? For what he was she did not know; only that it gave
her pleasure when he came in; relieved her of the need of thinking;
and gave her mind a little jog. He was looking at the lady. She
seemed upheld by their gaze; vibrating under it. And suddenly it
seemed to Eleanor that it had all happened before. So a girl had
come in that night in the restaurant: had stood, vibrating, in the
door. She knew exactly what he was going to say. He had said it
before, in the restaurant. He is going to say, She is like a ball
on the top of a fishmonger's fountain. As she thought it, he said
it. Does everything then come over again a little differently? she
thought. If so, is there a pattern; a theme, recurring, like
music; half remembered, half foreseen? . . . a gigantic pattern,
momentarily perceptible? The thought gave her extreme pleasure:
that there was a pattern. But who makes it? Who thinks it? Her
mind slipped. She could not finish her thought.

"Nicholas . . ." she said. She wanted him to finish it; to take
her thought and carry it out into the open unbroken; to make it
whole, beautiful, entire.

"Tell me, Nicholas . . ." she began; but she had no notion how she
was going to finish her sentence, or what it was that she wanted to
ask him. He was talking to Sara. She listened. He was laughing
at her. He was pointing at her feet.

". . . coming to a party," he was saying, "with one stocking that
is white, and one stocking that is blue."

"The Queen of England asked me to tea;" Sara hummed in time to the
music; "and which shall it be; the gold or the rose; for all are in
holes, my stockings, said she." This is their love-making, Eleanor
thought, half listening to their laughter, to their bickering.
Another inch of the pattern, she thought, still using her half-
formulated idea to stamp the immediate scene. And if this love-
making differs from the old, still it has its charm; it was "love,"
different from the old love, perhaps, but worse, was it? Anyhow,
she thought, they are aware of each other; they live in each other;
what else is love, she asked, listening to their laughter.

". . . Can you never act for yourself?" he was saying. "Can you
never even choose stockings for yourself?"

"Never! Never!" Sara was laughing.

". . . Because you have no life of your own," he said. "She lives
in dreams," he added, turning to Eleanor, "alone."

"The professor preaching his little sermon," Sara sneered, laying
her hand on his knee.

"Sara singing her little song," Nicholas laughed, pressing her
hand.

But they are very happy, Eleanor thought: they laugh at each other.

"Tell me, Nicholas . . ." she began again. But another dance was
beginning. Couples came flocking back into the room. Slowly,
intently, with serious faces, as if they were taking part in some
mystic rite which gave them immunity from other feelings, the
dancers began circling past them, brushing against their knees,
almost treading on their toes. And then someone stopped in front
of them.

"Oh, here's North," said Eleanor, looking up.

"North!" Nicholas exclaimed. "North! We met this evening," he
stretched out his hand to North, " - at Eleanor's."

"We did," said North warmly. Nicholas crushed his fingers; he felt
them separate again when the hand was removed. It was effusive;
but he liked it. He was feeling effusive himself. His eyes shone.
He had lost his puzzled look completely. His adventure had turned
out well. The girl had written her name in his pocket-book. "Come
and see me tomorrow at six," she had said.

"Good-evening again, Eleanor," he said, bowing over her hand.
"You're looking very young. You're looking extraordinarily
handsome. I like you in those clothes," he said, looking at her
Indian cloak.

"The same to you, North," she said. She looked up at him. She
thought she had never seen him look so handsome, so vigorous.

"Aren't  you going to dance?" she asked. The music was in full
swing.

"Not unless Sally will honour me," he said, bowing to her with
exaggerated courtesy. What has happened to him? Eleanor thought.
He looks so handsome, so happy. Sally rose. She gave her hand to
Nicholas.

"I will dance with you," she said. They stood for a moment
waiting; and then they circled away.



"What an odd-looking couple!" North exclaimed. He screwed his face
up into a grin as he watched them. "They don't  know how to dance!"
he added. He sat down by Eleanor in the chair that Nicholas had
left empty.

"Why don't  they marry?" he asked.

"Why should they?" she said.

"Oh, everybody ought to marry," he said. "And I like him, though
he's a bit of a - shall we say 'bounder?'" he suggested, as he
watched them circling rather awkwardly in and out.

"'Bounder'?" Eleanor echoed him.

"Oh it's his fob, you mean," she added, looking at the gold seal
which swung up and down as Nicholas danced.

"No, not a bounder," she said aloud. "He's - "

But North was not attending. He was looking at a couple at the
further end of the room. They were standing by the fireplace.
Both were young; both were silent; they seemed held still in that
position by some powerful emotion. As he looked at them, some
emotion about himself, about his own life, came over him, and he
arranged another background for them or for himself - not the
mantelpiece and the bookcase, but cataracts roaring, clouds racing,
and they stood on a cliff above a torrent. . . .

"Marriage isn't  for everyone," Eleanor interrupted.

He started. "No. Of course not," he agreed. He looked at her.
She had never married. Why not? he wondered. Sacrificed to the
family, he supposed - old Grandpapa without any fingers. Then some
memory came back to him of a terrace, a cigar and William Whatney.
Was not that her tragedy, that she had loved him? He looked at her
with affection. He felt fond of everyone at the moment.

"What luck to find you alone, Nell!" he said, laying his hand on
her knee.

She was touched; the feel of his hand on her knee pleased her.

"Dear North!" she exclaimed. She felt his excitement through her
dress; he was like a dog on a leash; straining forward with all his
nerves erect, she felt, as he laid his hand on her knee.

"But don't  marry the wrong woman!" she said.

"I?" he asked. "What makes you say that?" Had she seen him, he
wondered, shepherding the girl downstairs?

"Tell me - " she began. She wanted to ask him, coolly and sensibly,
what his plans were, now that they were alone; but as she spoke she
saw his face change; an exaggerated expression of horror came over
it.

"Milly!" he muttered. "Damn her!"



Eleanor glanced quickly over her shoulder. Her sister Milly,
voluminous in draperies proper to her sex and class, was coming
towards them. She had grown very stout. In order to disguise her
figure, veils with beads on them hung down over her arms. They
were so fat that they reminded North of asparagus; pale asparagus
tapering to a point.

"Oh, Eleanor!" she exclaimed. For she still kept relics of a
younger sister's doglike devotion.

"Oh, Milly!" said Eleanor, but not so cordially.

"How nice to see you, Eleanor!" said Milly, with her little old-
woman's chuckle; yet there was something deferential in her manner.
"And you too, North!"

She gave him her fat little hand. He noticed how the rings were
sunk in her fingers, as if the flesh had grown over them. Flesh
grown over diamonds disgusted him.

"How very nice that you're back again!" she said, settling slowly
down into her chair. Everything, he felt, became dulled. She cast
a net over them; she made them all feel one family; he had to think
of their relations in common; but it was an unreal feeling.

"Yes, we're staying with Connie," she said; they had come up for a
cricket match.

He sunk his head. He looked at his shoes.

"And I've  not heard a word about your travels, Nell," she went on.
They fall and fall, and cover all, he went on, as he listened to
the damp falling patter of his aunt's little questions. But he was
in such a superfluity of high spirits that he could still make her
words jingle. Did the tarantulas bite, she was asking him, and
were the stars bright? And where shall I spend tomorrow night? he
added, for the card in his waistcoat pocket rayed out of its own
accord without regard for the context scenes which obliterated the
present moment. They were staying with Connie, she went on, who
was expecting Jimmy, who was home from Uganda . . . his mind
slipped a few words, for he was seeing a garden, a room, and the
next word he heard was "adenoids" - which is a good word, he said to
himself, separating it from its context; wasp-waisted; pinched in
the middle; with a hard, shining, metallic abdomen, useful to
describe the appearance of an insect - but here a vast bulk
approached; chiefly white waistcoat, lined with black; and Hugh
Gibbs stood over them. North sprang up to offer him his chair.

"My dear boy, you don't  expect me to sit on THAT?" said Hugh,
deriding the rather spindly seat that North offered him.

"You must find me something - " he looked about him, holding his
hands to the sides of his white waistcoat, "more substantial."

North pulled a stuffed seat towards him. He lowered himself
cautiously.

"Chew, chew, chew," he said as he sat down.

And Milly said, "Tut-tut-tut," North observed.

That was what it came to - thirty years of being husband and wife - 
tut-tut-tut - and chew-chew-chew. It sounded like the half-
inarticulate munchings of animals in a stall. Tut-tut-tut, and
chew-chew-chew - as they trod out the soft steamy straw in the
stable; as they wallowed in the primeval swamp, prolific, profuse,
half-conscious, he thought; listening vaguely to the good-humoured
patter, which suddenly fastened itself upon him.

"What d'you weigh, North?" his uncle was asking, sizing him up. He
looked him up and down as if he were a horse.

"We must get you to fix a date," Milly added, "when the boys are
home."

They were inviting him to stay with them at the Towers in September
for cub-hunting. The men shot, and the women - he looked at his
aunt as if she might be breaking into young even there, on that
chair - the women broke off into innumerable babies. And those
babies had other babies; and the other babies had - adenoids. The
word recurred; but it now suggested nothing. He was sinking; he
was falling under their weight; the name in his pocket even was
fading. Could nothing be done about it? he asked himself. Nothing
short of revolution, he thought. The idea of dynamite, exploding
dumps of heavy earth, shooting earth up in a tree-shaped cloud,
came to his mind, from the War. But that's all poppy-cock, he
thought; war's poppy-cock, poppy-cock. Sara's word "poppy-cock"
returned. So what remains? Peggy caught his eye, where she stood
talking to an unknown man. You doctors, he thought, you
scientists, why don't  you drop a little crystal into a tumbler,
something starred and sharp, and make them swallow it? Common
sense; reason; starred and sharp. But would they swallow it? He
looked at Hugh. He had a way of blowing his cheeks in and out, as
he said tut-tut-tut and chew-chew-chew. Would you swallow it? he
said silently to Hugh.

Hugh turned to him again.

"And I hope you're going to stay in England now, North," he said,
"though I dare say it's a fine life out there?"

And so they turned to Africa and the paucity of jobs. His
exhilaration was oozing. The card no longer rayed out pictures.
The damp leaves were falling. They fall and fall and cover all, he
murmured to himself and looked at his aunt, colourless save for a
brown stain on her forehead; and her hair colourless save for a
stain like the yolk of egg on it. All over he suspected she must
be soft and discoloured like a pear that has gone sleepy. And Hugh
himself - his great hand was on his knee - was bound round with raw
beef-steak. He caught Eleanor's eye. There was a strained look in
it.

"Yes, how they've  spoilt it," she was saying.

But the resonance had gone out of her voice.

"Brand-new villas everywhere," she was saying. She had been down
in Dorsetshire apparently.

"Little red villas all along the road," she went on.

"Yes, that's what strikes me," he said, rousing himself to help
her, "how you've  spoilt England while I've  been away."

"But you won't  find many changes in our part of the world, North,"
said Hugh. He spoke with pride.

"No. But then we're lucky," said Milly. "We have several large
estates. We're very lucky," she repeated. "Except for Mr Phipps,"
she added. She gave a tart little laugh.

North woke up. She meant that, he thought. She spoke with an
acerbity that made her real. Not only did she become real, but the
village, the great house, the little house, the church and the
circle of old trees also appeared before him in complete reality.
He would stay with them.

"That's our parson," Hugh explained. "Quite a good chap in his
way; but high - very high. Candles - that sort of thing."

"And his wife . . ." Milly began.

Here Eleanor sighed. North looked at her. She was dropping off to
sleep. A glazed look, a fixed expression, had come over her face.
She looked terribly like Milly for a moment; sleep brought out the
family likeness. Then she opened her eyes wide; by an effort of
will she kept them open. But obviously she saw nothing.

"You must come down and see what you make of us," Hugh said. "What
about the first week in September, eh?" He swayed from side to
side as if his benevolence rolled about in him. He was like an old
elephant who may be going to kneel. And if he does kneel, how will
he ever get up again, North asked himself. And if Eleanor falls
sound asleep and snores, what am I going to do, left sitting here
between the knees of the elephant?

He looked round for an excuse to go.

There was Maggie coming along, not looking where she was going.
They saw her. He felt a strong desire to cry out, "Take care!
Take care!" for she was in the danger zone. The long white
tentacles that amorphous bodies leave floating so that they can
catch their food, would suck her in. Yes, they saw her: she was
lost.



"Here's Maggie!" Milly exclaimed, looking up.

"Haven't  seen you for an age!" said Hugh, trying to heave himself
up.

She had to stop; to put her hand into that shapeless paw. Using
the last ounce of energy that remained to him, from the address in
his waistcoat pocket, North rose. He would carry her off. He
would save her from the contamination of family life.

But she ignored him. She stood there, answering their greetings
with perfect composure as if using an outfit provided for
emergencies. Oh Lord, North said to himself, she's as bad as they
are. She was glazed; insincere. They were talking about HER
children now.

"Yes. That's the baby," she was saying, pointing to a boy who was
dancing with a girl.

"And your daughter, Maggie?" Milly asked, looking round.

North fidgeted. This is the conspiracy, he said to himself; this
is the steam roller that smooths, obliterates; rounds into
identity; rolls into balls. He listened. Jimmy was in Uganda;
Lily was in Leicestershire; MY boy - MY girl . . . they were saying.
But they're not interested in other people's children, he observed.
Only in their own; their own property; their own flesh and blood,
which they would protect with the unsheathed claws of the primeval
swamp, he thought, looking at Milly's fat little paws, even Maggie,
even she. For she too was talking about my boy, my girl. How then
can we be civilised, he asked himself?



Eleanor snored. She was nodding off, shamelessly, helplessly.
There was an obscenity in unconsciousness, he thought. Her mouth
was open; her head was on one side.

But now it was his turn. Silence gaped. One has to egg it on, he
thought; somebody has to say something, or human society would
cease. Hugh would cease; Milly would cease; and he was about to
apply himself to find something to say, something with which to
feed the immense vacancy of that primeval maw, when Delia, either
from the erratic desire of a hostess always to interrupt, or
divinely inspired by human charity - which he could not say - came
beckoning.

"The Ludbys!" she exclaimed. "The Ludbys!"

"Oh where? The dear Ludbys!" said Milly, and up they heaved and
off they went, for the Ludbys, it appeared, seldom left
Northumberland.



"Well, Maggie?" said North, turning to her - but here Eleanor made a
little click at the back of her throat. Her head pitched forward.
Sleep, now that she slept soundly, had given her dignity. She
looked peaceful, far from them, rapt in the calm which sometimes
gives the sleeper the look of the dead. They sat silent, for a
moment, alone together, in private.

"Why - why - why - " he said at last, making a gesture as if he were
plucking tufts of grass from the carpet.

"Why?" Maggie asked. "Why what?"

"The Gibbses," he murmured. He jerked his head at them, where they
stood talking by the fireplace. Gross, obese, shapeless, they
looked to him like a parody, a travesty, an excrescence that had
overgrown the form within, the fire within.

"What's wrong?" he asked. She looked too. But she said nothing.
Couples came dancing slowly past them. A girl stopped, and her
gesture as she raised her hand, unconsciously, had the seriousness
of the very young anticipating life in its goodness which touched
him.

"Why - ?" he jerked his thumb in the direction of the young, "when
they're so lovely - "

She too looked at the girl, who was fastening a flower that had
come undone in the front of her frock. She smiled. She said
nothing. Then half consciously she echoed his question without a
meaning in her echo, "Why?"

He was dashed for a moment. It seemed to him that she refused to
help him. And he wanted her to help him. Why should she not take
the weight off his shoulders and give him what he longed for - 
assurance, certainty? Because she too was deformed like the rest
of them? He looked down at her hands. They were strong hands;
fine hands; but if it were a question, he thought, watching the
fingers curl slightly, of "my" children, of "my" possessions, it
would be one rip down the belly; or teeth in the soft fur of the
throat. We cannot help each other, he thought, we are all
deformed. Yet, disagreeable as it was to him to remove her from
the eminence upon which he placed her, perhaps she was right, he
thought, and we who make idols of other people, who endow this man,
that woman, with power to lead us, only add to the deformity, and
stoop ourselves.

"I'm going to stay with them," he said aloud.

"At the Towers?" she asked.

"Yes," he said. "For cubbing in September."

She was not listening. Her eyes were on him. She was getting him
into relation with something else he felt. It made him uneasy.
She was looking at him as if he were not himself but somebody else.
He felt again the discomfort that he had felt when Sally described
him on the telephone.

"I know," he said, stiffening the muscles of his face, "I'm like
the picture of a Frenchman holding his hat."

"Holding his hat?" she asked.

"And getting fat," he added.



". . . Holding a hat . . . who's holding a hat?" said Eleanor,
opening her eyes.

She glanced about her in bewilderment. Since her last
recollection, and it seemed only a second ago, was of Milly talking
of candles in a church, something must have happened. Milly and
Hugh had been there; but they were gone. There had been a gap - a
gap filled with the golden light of lolling candles, and some
sensation which she could not name.

She woke up completely.

"What nonsense are you talking?" she said. "North's not holding a
hat! And he's not fat," she added. "Not at all, not at all," she
repeated, patting him affectionately on the knee.

She felt extraordinarily happy. Most sleep left some dream in
one's mind - some scene or figure remained when one woke up. But
this sleep, this momentary trance, in which the candles had lolled
and lengthened themselves, had left her with nothing but a feeling;
a feeling, not a dream.

"He's not holding a hat," she repeated.

They both laughed at her.

"You've  been dreaming, Eleanor," said Maggie.

"Have I?" she said. A deep gulf had been cut in the talk, it was
true. She could not remember what they had been saying. There was
Maggie; but Milly and Hugh had gone.

"Only a second's nap," she said. "But what are you going to do,
North? What are your plans?" she said, speaking rather quickly.

"We musn't  let him go back, Maggie," she said. "Not to that horrid
farm."

She wished to appear extremely practical, partly to prove that she
had not slept, partly to protect the extraordinary feeling of
happiness that still remained with her. Covered up from
observation it might survive, she felt.

"You've  saved enough, haven't  you?" she said aloud.

"Saved enough?" he said. Why, he wondered, did people who had been
asleep always want to make out that they were extremely wide-awake?
"Four or five thousand," he added at random.

"Well, that's enough," she insisted. "Five per cent; six per cent - "
She tried to do the sum in her head. She appealed to Maggie
for help. "Four or five thousand - how much would that be, Maggie?
Enough to live on, wouldn't  it?"

"Four or five thousand," repeated Maggie.

"At five or six per cent . . ." Eleanor put in. She could never do
sums in her head at the best of times; but for some reason it
seemed to her very important to bring things back to facts. She
opened her bag, found a letter, and produced a stubby little
pencil.

"There - work it out on that," she said. Maggie took the paper and
drew a few lines with the pencil as if to test it. North glanced
over her shoulder. Was she solving the problem before her - was she
considering his life, his needs? No. She was drawing, apparently
a caricature - he looked - of a big man opposite in a white
waistcoat. It was a farce. It made him feel slightly ridiculous.

"Don't  be so silly," he said.

"That's my brother," she said, nodding at the man in the white
waistcoat. "He used to take us for rides on an elephant. . . ."
She added a flourish to the waistcoat.

"And we're being very sensible," Eleanor protested.

"If you want to live in England, North - if you want - "

He cut her short.

"I don't  know what I want," he said.

"Oh, I see!" she said. She laughed. Her feeling of happiness
returned to her, her unreasonable exaltation. It seemed to her
that they were all young, with the future before them. Nothing was
fixed; nothing was known; life was open and free before them.

"Isn't  that odd?" she exclaimed. "Isn't  that queer? Isn't  that
why life's a perpetual - what shall I call it? - miracle? . . . I
mean," she tried to explain, for he looked puzzled, "old age they
say is like this; but it isn't . It's different; quite different.
So when I was a child; so when I was a girl; it's been a perpetual
discovery, my life. A miracle." She stopped. She was rambling on
again. She felt rather light-headed, after her dream.

"There's Peggy!" she exclaimed, glad to attach herself to something
solid. "Look at her! Reading a book!"



Peggy, marooned when the dance started, over by the bookcase, stood
as close to it as she could. In order to cover her loneliness she
took down a book. It was bound in green leather; and had, she
noted as she turned it in her hands, little gilt stars tooled upon
it. Which is all to the good, she thought, turning it over,
because then it'll seem as if I were admiring the binding. . . .
But I can't  stand here admiring the binding, she thought. She
opened it. He'll say what I'm thinking, she thought as she did so.
Books opened at random always did.

"La médiocrité de l'univers m'étonne et me révolte" she read. That
was it. Precisely. She read on. ". . . la petitesse de toutes
choses m'emplit de dégoűt . . ." She lifted her eyes. They were
treading on her toes. ". . . la pauvreté des tres humains
m'anéantit." She shut the book and put it back on the shelf.

Precisely, she said.

She turned her watch on her wrist and looked at it surreptitiously.
Time was getting on. An hour is sixty minutes, she said to
herself; two hours are one hundred and twenty minutes. How many
have I still to stay here? Could she go yet? She saw Eleanor
beckoning. She put the book back on the shelf. She went towards
them.



"Come, Peggy, come and talk to us," Eleanor called out, beckoning.

"D'you know what time it is, Eleanor?" said Peggy, coming up to
them. She pointed to her watch. "Don't  you think it's time to be
going?" she said.

"I'd forgotten the time," said Eleanor.

"But you'll be so tired tomorrow," Peggy protested, standing beside
her.

"How like a doctor!" North twitted her. "Health, health, health!"
he exclaimed. "But health's not an end in itself," he said,
looking up at her.

She ignored him.

"D'you mean to stay to the end?" she said to Eleanor. "This'll go
on all night." She looked at the twisting couples gyrating in time
to the tune on the gramophone, as if some animal were dying in a
slow but exquisite anguish.

"But we're enjoying ourselves," said Eleanor. "Come and enjoy
yourself too."

She pointed to the floor at her side. Peggy let herself down onto
the floor at her side. Give up brooding, thinking, analysing,
Eleanor meant she knew. Enjoy the moment - but could one? she
asked, pulling her skirts round her feet as she sat down. Eleanor
bent over and tapped her on the shoulder.

"I want you to tell me," she said, drawing her into the
conversation, since she looked so glum, "you're a doctor - you know
these things - what do dreams mean?"

Peggy laughed. Another of Eleanor's questions. Does two and two
make four - and what is the nature of the universe?

"I don't  mean dreams exactly," Eleanor went on. "Feelings - 
feelings that come when one's asleep?"

"My dear Nell," said Peggy, glancing up at her, "how often have I
told you? Doctors know very little about the body; absolutely
nothing about the mind." She looked down again.

"I always said they were humbugs!" North exclaimed.

"What a pity!" said Eleanor. "I was hoping you'd be able to
explain to me - " She was bending down. There was a flush on her
cheek, Peggy noted; she was excited; but what was there to be
excited about?

"Explain - what?" she asked.

"Oh, nothing," said Eleanor. Now I've  snubbed her, Peggy thought.

She looked at her again. Her eyes were bright; her cheeks were
flushed, or was it only the tan from her voyage to India? And a
little vein stood out on her forehead. But what was there to be
excited about? She leant back against the wall. From her seat on
the floor she had a queer view of people's feet; feet pointing this
way, feet pointing that way; patent leather pumps; satin slippers;
silk stockings and socks. They were dancing rhythmically,
insistently, to the tune of the fox-trot. And what about the
cocktail and the tea, said he to me, said he to me - the tune seemed
to repeat over and over again. And voices went on over her head.
Odd little gusts of inconsecutive conversations reached her . . .
down in Norfolk where my brother-in-law has a boat . . . Oh, a
complete washout, yes I agree. . . . People talked nonsense at
parties. And beside her Maggie was talking; North was talking;
Eleanor was talking. Suddenly Eleanor swept her hand out.

"There's Renny!" she was saying. "Renny, whom I never see. Renny
whom I love. . . . Come and talk to us, Renny." And a pair of
pumps crossed Peggy's field of vision and stopped in front of her.
He sat down beside Eleanor. She could just see the line of his
profile; the big nose; the thin cheek. And what about the
cocktails and the tea, said he to me, said he to me, the music
ground out; the couples danced past. But the little group on the
chairs above her were talking; they were laughing.

"I know you'll agree with me . . ." Eleanor was saying. Through
her half-shut eyes Peggy could see Renny turn towards her. She saw
his thin cheek; his big nose; his nails, she noticed, were very
close cut.

"Depends what you were saying . . ." he said.

"What were we saying?" Eleanor pondered. She's forgotten already,
Peggy suspected.

". . . That things have changed for the better," she heard
Eleanor's voice.

"Since you were a girl?" That she thought was Maggie's voice.

Then a voice from a skirt with a pink bow on the hem interrupted.
". . . I don't  know how it is but the heat doesn't  affect me as
much as it used to do. . . ." She looked up. There were fifteen
pink bows on the dress, accurately stitched, and wasn't  that Miriam
Parrish's little saint-like, sheep-like head on top?

"What I mean is, we've  changed in ourselves," Eleanor was saying.
"We're happier - we're freer - "

What does she mean by "happiness," by "freedom"? Peggy asked
herself, lapsing against the wall again.

"Take Renny and Maggie," she heard Eleanor saying. And then she
stopped. And then she went on again:

"D'you remember, Renny, the night of the raid? When I met Nicholas
for the first time . . . when we sat in the cellar? . . . Going
downstairs I said to myself, That's a happy marriage - " There was
another pause. "I said to myself," she continued, and Peggy saw
her hand laid on Renny's knee, "If I'd known Renny when I was
young. . . ." She stopped. Does she mean she would have fallen in
love with him? Peggy wondered. Again the music interrupted . . .
said he to me, said he to me. . . .

"No, never . . ." she heard Eleanor say. "No, never. . . ." Was
she saying she had never been in love, never wanted to marry?
Peggy wondered. They were laughing.

"Why, you look like a girl of eighteen!" she heard North say.

"And I feel like one!" Eleanor exclaimed. But you'll be a wreck
tomorrow morning Peggy thought, looking at her. She was flushed,
the veins stood out on her forehead.

"I feel . . ." she stopped. She put her hand to her head: "as if
I'd been in another world! So happy!" she exclaimed.

"Tosh, Eleanor, tosh," said Renny.

I thought he'd say that, Peggy said to herself with some queer
satisfaction. She could see his profile as he sat on the other
side of her aunt's knee. The French are logical; they are
sensible, she thought. Still, she added, why not let Eleanor have
her little flutter if she enjoys it?

"Tosh? What d'you mean by 'tosh'?" Eleanor was asking. She was
leaning forward; she held her hand up as if she wanted him to
speak.

"Always talking of the other world," he said. "Why not this one?"

"But I meant this world!" she said. "I meant, happy in this world - 
happy with living people." She waved her hand as if to embrace
the miscellaneous company, the young, the old, the dancers, the
talkers; Miriam with her pink bows, and the Indian in his turban.
Peggy sank back against the wall. Happy in this world, she
thought, happy with living people!

The music stopped. The young man who had been putting records on
the gramophone had walked off. The couples broke apart and began
to push their way through the door. They were going to eat
perhaps; they were going to stream out into the back garden and sit
on hard sooty chairs. The music which had been cutting grooves in
her mind had ceased. There was a lull - a silence. Far away she
heard the sounds of the London night; a horn hooted; a siren wailed
on the river. The far-away sounds, the suggestion they brought in
of other worlds, indifferent to this world, of people toiling,
grinding, in the heart of darkness, in the depths of night, made
her say over Eleanor's words, Happy in this world, happy with
living people. But how can one be "happy"? she asked herself, in a
world bursting with misery. On every placard at every street
corner was Death; or worse - tyranny; brutality; torture; the fall
of civilisation; the end of freedom. We here, she thought, are
only sheltering under a leaf, which will be destroyed. And then
Eleanor says the world is better, because two people out of all
those millions are "happy." Her eyes had fixed themselves on the
floor; it was empty now save for a wisp of muslin torn from some
skirt. But why do I notice everything? she thought. She shifted
her position. Why must I think? She did not want to think. She
wished that there were blinds like those in railway carriages that
came down over the light and hooded the mind. The blue blind that
one pulls down on a night journey, she thought. Thinking was
torment; why not give up thinking, and drift and dream? But the
misery of the world, she thought, forces me to think. Or was that
a pose? Was she not seeing herself in the becoming attitude of one
who points to his bleeding heart? to whom the miseries of the world
are misery, when in fact, she thought, I do not love my kind.
Again she saw the ruby-splashed pavement, and faces mobbed at the
door of a picture palace; apathetic, passive faces; the faces of
people drugged with cheap pleasures; who had not even the courage
to be themselves, but must dress up, imitate, pretend. And here,
in this room, she thought, fixing her eyes on a couple. . . . But
I will not think, she repeated; she would force her mind to become
a blank and lie back, and accept quietly, tolerantly, whatever
came.

She listened. Scraps reached her from above. ". . . flats in
Highgate have bathrooms," they were saying. ". . . Your mother . . .
Digby. . . . Yes, Crosby's still alive - " It was family gossip,
and they were enjoying it. But how can I enjoy it? she said to
herself. She was too tired; the skin round her eyes felt taut; a
hoop was bound tight over her head; she tried to think herself away
into the darkness of the country. But it was impossible; they were
laughing. She opened her eyes, exacerbated by their laughter.

That was Renny laughing. He held a sheet of paper in his hand; his
head was flung back; his mouth was wide open. From it came a sound
like Ha! Ha! Ha! That is laughter, she said to herself. That is
the sound people make when they are amused.

She watched him. Her muscles began to twitch involuntarily. She
could not help laughing too. She stretched out her hand and Renny
gave her the paper. It was folded; they had been playing a game.
Each of them had drawn a different part of a picture. On top there
was a woman's head like Queen Alexandra, with a fuzz of little
curls; then a bird's neck; the body of a tiger; and stout
elephant's legs dressed in child's drawers completed the picture.

"I drew that - I drew that!" said Renny pointing to the legs from
which a long trail of ribbon depended. She laughed, laughed,
laughed; she could not help laughing.

"The face that launched a thousand ships!" said North, pointing to
another part of the monster's person. They all laughed again. She
stopped laughing; her lips smoothed themselves out. But her
laughter had had some strange effect on her. It had relaxed her,
enlarged her. She felt, or rather she saw, not a place, but a
state of being, in which there was real laughter, real happiness,
and this fractured world was whole; whole, and free. But how could
she say it?

"Look here . . ." she began. She wanted to express something that
she felt to be very important; about a world in which people were
whole, in which people were free . . . But they were laughing; she
was serious. "Look here . . ." she began again.

Eleanor stopped laughing.

"Peggy wants to say something," she said. The others stopped
talking, but they had stopped at the wrong moment. She had nothing
to say when it came to the point, and yet she had to speak.

"Here," she began again, "here you all are - talking about North - "
He looked up at her in surprise. It was not what she had meant to
say, but she must go on now that she had begun. Their faces gaped
at her like birds with their mouths open. ". . . How he's to live,
where he's to live," she went on. ". . . But what's the use,
what's the point of saying that?"

She looked at her brother. A feeling of animosity possessed her.
He was still smiling, but his smile smoothed itself out as she
looked at him.

"What's the use?" she said, facing him. "You'll marry. You'll
have children. What'll you do then? Make money. Write little
books to make money. . . ."

She had got it wrong. She had meant to say something impersonal,
but she was being personal. It was done now however; she must
flounder on now.

"You'll write one little book, and then another little book," she
said viciously, "instead of living . . . living differently,
differently."

She stopped. There was the vision still, but she had not grasped
it. She had broken off only a little fragment of what she meant to
say, and she had made her brother angry. Yet there it hung before
her, the thing she had seen, the thing she had not said. But as
she fell back with a jerk against the wall, she felt relieved of
some oppression; her heart thumped; the veins on her forehead stood
out. She had not said it, but she had tried to say it. Now she
could rest; now she could think herself away under the shadow of
their ridicule, which had no power to hurt her, into the country.
Her eyes half shut; it seemed to her that she was on a terrace, in
the evening; an owl went up and down, up and down; its white wing
showed on the dark of the hedge; and she heard country people
singing and the rattle of wheels on a road.

Then gradually the blur became distinct; she saw the line of the
bookcase opposite; the wisp of muslin on the floor; and two large
feet, in tight shoes, so that the bunions showed, stopped in front
of her.



For a moment nobody moved; nobody spoke. Peggy sat still. She did
not want to move, or to speak. She wanted to rest, to lean, to
dream. She felt very tired. Then more feet stopped, and the hem
of a black skirt.

"Aren't  you people coming down to supper?" said a chuckling little
voice. She looked up. It was her aunt Milly, with her husband by
her side.

"Supper's downstairs," said Hugh. "Supper's downstairs." And they
passed on.

"How prosperous they've  grown!" said North's voice, laughing at
them.

"Ah, but they're so good to people . . ." Eleanor protested. The
sense of the family again, Peggy noted.

Then the knee against which she was sheltering herself moved.

"We must go," said Eleanor. Wait, wait, Peggy wanted to implore
her. There was something she wanted to ask her; something she
wanted to add to her outburst, since nobody had attacked her, and
nobody had laughed at her. But it was useless; the knees
straightened themselves; the red cloak elongated itself; Eleanor
had risen. She was hunting for her bag or her handkerchief; she
was ferreting in the cushions of her chair. As usual, she had lost
something.

"I'm sorry to be such an old muddler," she apologised. She shook a
cushion; coins rolled out onto the floor. A sixpenny bit spun on
its edge across the carpet, reached a pair of silver shoes on the
floor and fell flat.

"There!" Eleanor exclaimed. "There! . . . But that's Kitty! isn't 
it?" she exclaimed.

Peggy looked up. A handsome elderly woman, with curled white hair
and something shining in her hair was standing in the doorway
looking round her, as if she had just come in and were looking for
her hostess, who was not there. It was at her feet that the
sixpence had fallen.

"Kitty!" Eleanor repeated. She went towards her with her hands
stretched out. They all got up. Peggy got up. Yes, it was over;
it was destroyed she felt. Directly something got together, it
broke. She had a feeling of desolation. And then you have to pick
up the pieces, and make something new, something different, she
thought, and crossed the room, and joined the foreigner, the man
she called Brown, whose real name was Nicholas Pomjalovsky.



"Who is that lady," Nicholas asked her, "who appears to come into a
room as if the whole world belonged to her?"

"That's Kitty Lasswade," said Peggy. As she stood in the door,
they could not pass.

"I'm afraid I'm dreadfully late," they heard her saying in her
clear, authoritative tones. "But I've  been to the ballet."

That's Kitty, is it? North said to himself, looking at her. She
was one of those well-set-up rather masculine old ladies who
repelled him slightly. He thought he remembered that she was the
wife of one of our governors; or was it the Viceroy of India? He
could see her, as she stood there, doing the honours of Government
House. "Sit here. Sit there. And you, young man, I hope you take
plenty of exercise?" He knew the type. She had a short straight
nose and blue eyes very wide apart. She might have looked very
dashing in the eighties, he thought; in a tight riding-habit; worn
a small hat, with a cock's feather in it; perhaps had an affair
with an aide-de-camp; and then settled down, become dictatorial,
and told stories about her past. He listened.

"Ah, but he's not a patch on Nijinsky!" she was saying.

The sort of thing she would say, he thought. He examined the books
in the bookcase. He took one out and held it upside down. One
little book, and then another little book - Peggy's taunt returned
to him. The words had stung him out of all proportion to their
surface meaning. She had turned on him with such violence, as if
she despised him; she had looked as if she were going to burst into
tears. He opened the little book. Latin, was it? He broke off a
sentence and let it swim in his mind. There the words lay,
beautiful, yet meaningless, yet composed in a pattern - nox est
perpetua una dormienda. He remembered his master saying, Mark the
long word at the end of the sentence. There the words floated; but
just as they were about to give out their meaning, there was a
movement at the door. Old Patrick had come ambling up, had given
his arm gallantly to the widow of the Governor-General, and they
were proceeding with a curious air of antiquated ceremony down the
stairs. The others began to follow them. The younger generation
following in the wake of the old, North said to himself as he put
the book back on the shelf and followed. Only, he observed, they
were not so very young; Peggy - there were white hairs on Peggy's
head - she must be thirty-seven, thirty-eight?



"Enjoying yourself, Peg?" he said as they hung back behind the
others. He had a vague feeling of hostility towards her. She
seemed to him bitter, disillusioned, and very critical of everyone,
especially of himself.

"You go first, Patrick," they heard Lady Lasswade boom out in her
genial loud voice. "These staircases are not adapted . . ." she
paused, as she advanced what was probably a rheumatic leg, "for old
people who. . ." there was another pause as she descended another
step, "'ve  been kneeling on damp grass killing slugs."

North looked at Peggy and laughed. He had not expected the
sentence to end like that, but the widows of viceroys, he thought,
always have gardens, always kill slugs. Peggy smiled too. But he
felt uncomfortable with her. She had attacked him. There they
stood, however, side by side.

"Did you see old William Whatney?" she said, turning to him.

"No!" he exclaimed. "HE still alive? That old white walrus with
the whiskers?"

"Yes - that's him," she said. There was an old man in a white
waistcoat standing in the door.

"The old Mock Turtle," he said. They had to fall back on childish
slang, on childish memories, to cover their distance, their
hostility.

"D'you remember . . ." he began.

"The night of the row?" she said. "The night I let myself out of
the window by a rope."

"And we picnicked in the Roman camp," he said.

"We should never have been found out if that horrid little scamp
hadn't  told on us," she said, descending a step.

"A little beast with pink eyes," said North.

They could think of nothing else to say, as they stood blocked,
waiting for the others to move on, side by side. And he used to
read her his poetry in the apple-loft, he remembered, and as they
walked up and down by the rose bushes. And now they had nothing to
say to each other.

"Perry," he said, descending another step, suddenly remembering the
name of the pink-eyed boy who had seen them coming home that
morning and had told on them.

"Alfred," she added.

She still knew certain things about him, he thought; they still had
something very profound in common. That was why, he thought, she
had hurt him by what she had said, before the others, about his
"writing little books." It was their past condemning his present.
He glanced at her.

Damn women, he thought, they're so hard; so unimaginative. Curse
their little inquisitive minds. What did their "education" amount
to? It only made her critical, censorious. Old Eleanor, with all
her rambling and stumbling, was worth a dozen of Peggy any day.
She was neither one thing nor the other, he thought, glancing at
her; neither in the fashion nor out of it.

She felt him look at her and look away. He was finding fault with
something about her, she knew. Her hands? Her dress? No, it was
because she criticised him, she thought. Yes, she thought as she
descended another step, now I'm going to be trounced; now I'm going
to be paid back for telling him he'd write "little books." It
takes from ten to fifteen minutes, she thought, to get an answer;
and then it'll be something off the point but disagreeable - very,
she thought. The vanity of men was immeasurable. She waited. He
looked at her again. And now he's comparing me with the girl I saw
him talking to, she thought, and saw again the lovely, hard face.
He'll tie himself up with a red-lipped girl, and become a drudge.
He must, and I can't , she thought. No, I've  a sense of guilt
always. I shall pay for it, I shall pay for it, I kept saying to
myself even in the Roman camp, she thought. She would have no
children, and he would produce little Gibbses, more little Gibbses,
she thought, looking in at the door of a solicitor's office, unless
she leaves him at the end of the year for some other man. . . .
The solicitor's name was Alridge, she noted. But I will take no
more notes; I will enjoy myself, she thought suddenly. She put her
hand on his arm.

"Met anybody amusing tonight?" she said.

He guessed that she had seen him with the girl.

"One girl," he said briefly.

"So I saw," she said.

She looked away.

"I thought her lovely," she said, carefully observing a tinted
picture of a bird with a long beak that hung on the stairs.

"Shall I bring her to see you?" he asked.

So he cared for her opinion, did he? Her hand was still on his
arm; she felt something hard and taut beneath the sleeve, and the
touch of his flesh, bringing back to her the nearness of human
beings and their distance, so that if one meant to help one hurt,
yet they depended on each other, produced in her such a tumult of
sensation that she could scarcely keep herself from crying out,
North! North! North! But I mustn't  make a fool of myself again,
she said to herself.

"Any evening after six," she said aloud, carefully descending
another step, and they reached the bottom of the stairs.

A roar of voices sounded from behind the door of the supper room.
She withdrew her hand from his arm. The door burst open.



"Spoons! spoons! spoons!" cried Delia, brandishing her arms in a
rhetorical manner as if she were still declaiming to someone
inside. She caught sight of her nephew and niece. "Be an angel,
North, and fetch spoons!" she cried, throwing her hands out towards
him.

"Spoons for the widow of the Governor-General!" North cried,
catching her manner, imitating her dramatic gesture.

"In the kitchen, in the basement!" Delia cried, waving her arm at
the kitchen stairs. "Come, Peggy, come," she said, catching
Peggy's hand in hers, "we're all sitting down to supper." She
burst into the room where they were having supper. It was crowded.
People were sitting on the floor, on chairs, on office stools.
Long office tables, little typewriting tables, had been pressed
into use. They were strewn with flowers, frilled with flowers.
Carnations, roses, daisies, were flung down higgledy-piggledy.
"Sit on the floor, sit anywhere," Delia commanded, waving her hand
promiscuously.

"Spoons are coming," she said to Lady Lasswade, who was drinking
her soup out of a mug.

"But I don't  want a spoon," said Kitty. She tilted the mug and
drank.

"No, you wouldn't ," said Delia, "but other people do."

North brought in a bunch of spoons and she took them from him.

"Now who wants a spoon and who doesn't ?" she said, brandishing the
bunch of spoons in front of her. Some people do and some don't ,
she thought.

Her sort of people, she thought, did not want spoons; the others - 
the English - did. She had been making that distinction between
people all her life.

"A spoon? A spoon?" she said, looking round her at the crowded
room with some complacency. All sorts of people were there, she
noted. That had always been her aim; to mix people; to do away
with the absurd conventions of English life. And she had done it
tonight, she thought. There were nobles and commoners; people
dressed and people not dressed; people drinking out of mugs, and
people waiting with their soup getting cold for a spoon to be
brought to them.

"A spoon for me," said her husband, looking up at her.

She wrinkled her nose. For the thousandth time he had dashed her
dream. Thinking to marry a wild rebel, she had married the most
King-respecting, Empire-admiring of country gentlemen, and for that
very reason partly - because he was, even now, such a magnificent
figure of a man. "A spoon for your Uncle," she said dryly, and
sent North off with the bunch. Then she sat down beside Kitty, who
was gulping her soup like a child at a school treat. She set down
her mug empty, among the flowers.

"Poor flowers," she said, taking up a carnation that lay on the
table-cloth and putting it to her lips. "They'll die, Delia - they
want water."

"Roses are cheap today," said Delia. "Twopence a bunch off a
barrow in Oxford Street," she said. She took up a red rose and
held it under the light, so that it shone, veined, semi-
transparent.

"What a rich country England is!" she said, laying it down again.
She took up her mug.

"What I'm always telling you," said Patrick, wiping his mouth.
"The only civilised country in the whole world," he added.

"I thought we were on the verge of a smash," said Kitty. "Not that
it looked much like it at Covent Garden tonight," she added.

"Ah, but it's true," he sighed, going on with his own thoughts.
"I'm sorry to say it - but we're savages compared with you."

"He won't  be happy till he's got Dublin Castle back again," Delia
twitted him.

"You don't  enjoy your freedom?" said Kitty, looking at the queer
old man whose face always made her think of a hairy gooseberry.
But his body was magnificent.

"It seems to me that our new freedom is a good deal worse than our
old slavery," said Patrick, fumbling with his toothpick.

Politics as usual, money and politics, North thought, overhearing
them, as he went round with the last of his spoons.

"You're not going to tell me that all that struggle has been in
vain, Patrick?" said Kitty.

"Come to Ireland and see for yourself, m'lady," he said grimly.

"It's too early - too early to tell," said Delia.

Her husband looked past her with the sad innocent eyes of an old
sporting dog whose hunting days are over. But they could not keep
their fixity for long. "Who's this chap with the spoons?" he said,
resting his eyes on North, who stood just behind them, waiting.

"North," said Delia. "Come and sit by us, North."

"Good-evening to you, Sir," said Patrick. They had met already,
but he had already forgotten.

"What, Morris's son?" said Kitty, turning round abruptly. She
shook hands cordially. He sat down and took a gulp of soup.

"He's just back from Africa. He's been on a farm there," said
Delia.

"And how does the old country strike you?" said Patrick, leaning
towards him genially.

"Very crowded," he said, looking round the room. "And you all
talk," he added, "about money and politics." That was his stock
phrase. He had said it twenty times already.

"You were in Africa?" said Lady Lasswade. "And what made you give
up your farm?" she demanded. She looked him in the eyes and spoke
just as he expected she would speak; too imperiously for his
liking. What business is that of yours, old lady? he asked
himself.

"I'd had about enough of it," he said aloud.

"And I'd have given anything to be a farmer!" she exclaimed. That
was a little out of the picture, North thought. So were her eyes;
she ought to have worn a pince-nez; but she did not.

"But in my youth," she said, rather fiercely - her hands were rather
stubby, and the skin was rough, but she gardened, he remembered - 
"that wasn't  allowed."

"No," said Patrick. "And it's my belief," he continued, drumming
on the table with a fork, "that we should all be very glad, very
glad, to go back to things as they were. What's the War done for
us, eh? Ruined me for one." He wagged his head with melancholy
tolerance from side to side.

"I'm sorry to hear that," said Kitty. "But speaking for myself,
the old days were bad days, wicked days, cruel days. . . ." Her
eyes turned blue with passion.

What about the aide-de-camp, and the hat with a cock's feather in
it? North asked himself.

"Don't  you agree with me, Delia?" said Kitty, turning to her.

But Delia was talking across her, using her rather exaggerated
Irish sing-song to someone at the next table. Don't  I remember
this room, Kitty thought; a meeting; an argument. But what was it
about? Force . . .

"My dear Kitty," Patrick interrupted, patting her hand with his
great paw. "That's another instance of what I'm telling you. Now
these ladies have got the vote," he said, turning to North, "are
they any better off?"

Kitty looked fierce for a moment; then she smiled.

"We won't  argue, my old friend," she said, giving him a little pat
on the hand.

"And it's just the same with the Irish," he went on. North saw
that he was bent on treading out the round of his familiar thoughts
like an old broken-winded horse. "They'd be glad enough to join
the Empire again, I assure you. I come of a family," he said to
North, "that has served its king and country for three hundred - "

"English settlers," said Delia, rather shortly, returning to her
soup. That's what they quarrel about when they're alone, North
thought.

"We've  been three hundred years in the country," old Patrick
continued, padding out his round - he laid a hand on North's arm,
"and what strikes an old fellow like me, an old fogy like me - "

"Nonsense, Patrick," Delia struck in, "I've  never seen you look
younger. Might be fifty, mightn't  he, North?"

But Patrick shook his head.

"I shan't  see seventy again," he said simply. ". . . But what
strikes an old fellow like me," he continued, patting North's arm,
"is with such a lot of good feeling about," he nodded rather
vaguely at a placard that was pinned to the wall - "and nice things
too," - he referred perhaps to the flowers, but his head jerked
involuntarily as he talked - "what do these fellows want to be
shooting each other for? I don't  join any societies; I don't  sign
any of these" - he pointed to the placard - "what d'you call 'em?
manifestoes - I just go to my friend Mike, or it may be Pat - they're
all good friends of mine, and we - "

He stooped and pinched his foot.

"Lord, these shoes!" he complained.

"Tight, are they?" said Kitty. "Kick 'em off."

Why had the poor old boy been brought over here, North wondered,
and stuck into those tight shoes? He was clearly talking to his
dogs. There was a look in his eyes now when he raised them again
and tried to recover the drift of what he had been saying that was
like the look of a sportsman who saw the birds rising in a
semicircle over the wide green bog. But they were out of shot. He
could not remember where he had got to. ". . . We talk things
over," he said, "round a table." His eyes became mild and vacant
as if the engine were cut off, and his mind glided on silently.

"The English talk too," said North perfunctorily. Patrick nodded,
and looked vaguely at a group of young people. But he was not
interested in what other people were saying. His mind could no
longer stretch beyond its beat. His body was still beautifully
proportioned; it was his mind that was old. He would say the same
thing all over again, and when he had said it he would pick his
teeth and sit gazing in front of him. There he sat now, holding a
flower between his finger and thumb, loosely, without looking at
it, as if his mind were gliding on - But Delia interrupted.

"North must go and talk to his friends," she said. Like so many
wives, she saw when her husband was becoming a bore, North thought,
as he got up.

"Don't  wait to be introduced," said Delia, waving her hand. "Do
just what you like - just what you like," her husband echoed her,
beating on the table with his flower.



North was glad to go; but where was he to go now? He was an
outsider, he felt again, as he glanced round the room. All these
people knew each other. They called each other - he stood on the
outskirts of a little group of young men and women - by their
Christian names, by their nicknames. Each was already part of a
little group, he felt as he listened, keeping on the outskirts. He
wanted to hear what they were saying; but not to be drawn in
himself. He listened. They were arguing. Politics and money, he
said to himself; money and politics. That phrase came in handy.
But he could not understand the argument, which was already heated.
Never have I felt so lonely, he thought. The old platitude about
solitude in a crowd was true; for hills and trees accept one; human
beings reject one. He turned his back and pretended to read the
particulars of a desirable property at Bexhill which Patrick had
called for some reason "a manifesto." "Running water in all the
bedrooms," he read. He overheard scraps of talk. That's Oxford,
that's Harrow, he continued, recognising the tricks of speech that
were caught at school and college. It seemed to him that they were
still cutting little private jokes about Jones minor winning the
long jump; and old Foxy, or whatever the headmaster's name was. It
was like hearing small boys at a private school, hearing these
young men talk politics. "I'm right . . . you're wrong." At their
age, he thought, he had been in the trenches; he had seen men
killed. But was that a good education? He shifted from one foot
to another. At their age, he thought, he had been alone on a farm
sixty miles from a white man, in control of a herd of sheep. But
was that a good education? Anyhow it seemed to him, half hearing
their argument, looking at their gestures, catching their slang,
that they were all the same sort. Public school and university, he
sized them up as he looked over his shoulder. But where are the
Sweeps and the Sewer-men, the Seamstresses and the Stevedores? he
thought, making a list of trades that began with the letter S. For
all Delia's pride in her promiscuity, he thought, glancing at the
people, there were only Dons and Duchesses, and what other words
begin with D? he asked himself, as he scrutinised the placard
again - Drabs and Drones?

He turned. A nice fresh-faced boy with a freckled nose in ordinary
day clothes was looking at him. If he didn't  take care he would be
drawn in too. Nothing would be easier than to join a society, to
sign what Patrick called "a manifesto." But he did not believe in
joining societies, in signing manifestoes. He turned back to the
desirable residence with its three-quarters of an acre of garden
and running water in all the bedrooms. People met, he thought,
pretending to read, in hired halls. And one of them stood on a
platform. There was the pump-handle gesture; the wringing-wet-
clothes gesture; and then the voice, oddly detached from the little
figure and tremendously magnified by the loudspeaker, went booming
and bawling round the hall: Justice! Liberty! For a moment, of
course, sitting among knees, wedged in tight, a ripple, a nice
emotional quiver, went over the skin; but next morning, he said to
himself as he glanced again at the house-agents' placard, there's
not an idea, not a phrase that would feed a sparrow. What do they
mean by Justice and Liberty? he asked, all these nice young men
with two or three hundred a year. Something's wrong, he thought;
there's a gap, a dislocation, between the word and the reality. If
they want to reform the world, he thought, why not begin there, at
the centre, with themselves? He turned on his heel and ran
straight into an old man in a white waistcoat.

"Hullo!" he said, holding out his hand.



It was his Uncle Edward. He had the look of an insect whose body
has been eaten out, leaving only the wings, the shell.

"Very glad to see you back, North," said Edward, and shook him
warmly by the hand.

"Very glad," he repeated. He was shy. He was spare and thin. He
looked as if his face had been carved and graved by a multitude of
fine instruments; as if it had been left out on a frosty night and
frozen over. He threw his head back like a horse champing a bit;
but he was an old horse, a blue-eyed horse whose bit no longer
irked him. His movements were from habit, not from feeling. What
had he been doing all these years? North wondered, as they stood
there surveying each other. Editing Sophocles? What would happen
if Sophocles one of these days were edited? What would they do
then, these eaten out hollow-shelled old men?

"You've  filled out," said Edward, looking him up and down. "You've 
filled out," he repeated.

There was a subtle deference in his manner. Edward, the scholar,
paid tribute to North, the soldier. Yes, but they found it
difficult to talk. He had the air of being stamped, North thought;
he had kept something, after all, out of the hubbub.

"Shan't  we sit down?" said Edward, as if he wished to talk to him
seriously about interesting things. They looked about for a quiet
place. He had not frittered his time away talking to old red
setters and raising his gun, North thought, glancing about him, to
see if by chance there was a quiet place in the room where they
could sit down and talk. But there were only two office stools
empty beside Eleanor over there in the corner.

She saw them and called out, "Oh, there's Edward! I know there was
something I wanted to ask. . ." she began.

It was a relief that the interview with the headmaster should be
broken up by this impulsive, foolish old woman. She was holding
out her pocket-handkerchief.

"I made a knot," she was saying. Yes, there it was, a knot in her
pocket-handkerchief.

"Now what did I make a knot for?" she said, looking up.

"It is an admirable habit to make a knot," said Edward in his
courteous, clipped way, lowering himself a little stiffly onto the
chair beside her. "But at the same time it is advisable. . . ."
He stopped. That's what I like about him, North thought, taking
the other chair: he left half his sentence unfinished.

"It was to remind me - " said Eleanor putting her hand to her thick
crop of white hair. Then she stopped. What is it that makes him
look so calm, so carved, North thought, stealing a look at Edward,
who waited with admirable serenity for his sister to remember why
she had made a knot in her handkerchief. There was something final
about him; he left half his sentences unfinished. He hadn't 
worried himself about politics and money, he thought. There was
something sealed up, stated, about him. Poetry and the past, was
it? But as he fixed his eyes upon him, Edward smiled at his
sister.

"Well, Nell?" he said.

It was a quiet smile, a tolerant smile.

North broke in, for Eleanor was still ruminating over her knot. "I
met a man at the Cape who was a tremendous admirer of yours, Uncle
Edward," he said. The name came back to him - "Arbuthnot," he said.

"R. K.?" said Edward. And he raised his hand to his head and
smiled. It pleased him, that compliment. He was vain; he was
touchy; he was - North stole a glance to add another impression - 
established. Glazed over with the smooth glossy varnish that those
in authority wear. For he was now - what? North could not
remember. A professor? A master? Somebody who had an attitude
fixed on him, from which he could not relax any longer. Still,
Arbuthnot, R. K., had said, with emotion, that he owed more to
Edward than to any man.

"He said he owed more to you than to any man," he said aloud.

Edward brushed aside the compliment; but it pleased him. He had a
way of putting his hand to his head that North remembered. And
Eleanor called him "Nigs." She laughed at him; she preferred
failures, like Morris. There she sat holding her pocket-
handkerchief in her hand, smiling, ironically, covertly, at some
memory.

"And what are your plans?" said Edward. "You deserve a holiday."

There was something flattering in his manner, North thought, like a
schoolmaster welcoming back to school an old boy who had won
distinction. But he meant it; he doesn't  say what he doesn't  mean,
North thought, and that was alarming too. They were silent.

"Delia's got a wonderful lot of people here tonight, hasn't  she?"
said Edward, turning to Eleanor. They sat looking at the different
groups. His clear blue eyes surveyed the scene amiably but
sardonically. But what's he thinking, North asked himself. He's
got something behind that mask, he thought. Something that's kept
him clear of this muddle. The past? Poetry? he thought, looking
at Edward's distinct profile. It was finer than he remembered.

"I'd like to brush up my classics," he said suddenly. "Not that I
ever had much to brush," he added, foolishly, afraid of the
schoolmaster.

Edward did not seem to be listening. He was raising his eyeglass
and letting it fall, as he looked at the queer jumble. There his
head rested with the chin thrown up, on the back of his chair. The
crowd, the noise, the clatter of knives and forks, made it
unnecessary to talk. North stole another glance at him. The past
and poetry, he said to himself, that's what I want to talk about,
he thought. He wanted to say it aloud. But Edward was too formed
and idiosyncratic; too black and white and linear, with his head
tilted up on the back of his chair, to ask him questions easily.

Now he was talking about Africa, and North wanted to talk about the
past and poetry. There it was, he thought, locked up in that fine
head, the head that was like a Greek boy's head grown white; the
past and poetry. Then why not prise it open? Why not share it?
What's wrong with him, he thought, as he answered the usual
intelligent Englishman's questions about Africa and the state of
the country. Why can't  he flow? Why can't  he pull the string of
the shower bath? Why's it all locked up, refrigerated? Because
he's a priest, a mystery monger, he thought; feeling his coldness;
this guardian of beautiful words.

But Edward was speaking to him.

"We must arrange a date," he was saying, "next autumn." He meant
it too.

"Yes," North said aloud, "I'd love to. . . . In the autumn. . . ."
And he saw before him a house with creeper-shaded rooms, butlers
creeping, decanters, and some one handing a box of good cigars.



Unknown young men coming round with trays pressed different
eatables upon them.

"How very kind of you!" said Eleanor, taking a glass. He himself
took a glass of some yellow liquid. It was some kind of claret
cup, he supposed. The little bubbles kept rising to the top and
exploding. He watched them rise and explode.

"Who's that pretty girl," said Edward, inclining his head, "over
there, standing in the corner, talking to the youth?"

He was benignant and urbane.

"Aren't  they lovely?" said Eleanor. "Just what I was thinking. . . .
Everyone looks so young. That's Maggie's daughter. . . . But
who's that talking to Kitty?"

"That's Middleton," said Edward. "What, don't  you remember him?
You must have met him in the old days."

They chatted, basking there at their ease. Spinners and sitters in
the sun, North thought, taking their ease when the day's work is
over; Eleanor and Edward each in his own niche, with his hands on
the fruit, tolerant, assured.

He watched the bubbles rising in the yellow liquid. For them it's
all right, he thought; they've  had their day: but not for him, not
for his generation. For him a life modelled on the jet  he was
watching the bubbles rise , on the spring, of the hard leaping
fountain; another life; a different life. Not halls and
reverberating megaphones; not marching in step after leaders, in
herds, groups, societies, caparisoned. No; to begin inwardly, and
let the devil take the outer form, he thought, looking up at a
young man with a fine forehead and a weak chin. Not black shirts,
green shirts, red shirts - always posing in the public eye; that's
all poppycock. Why not down barriers and simplify? But a world,
he thought, that was all one jelly, one mass, would be a rice
pudding world, a white counterpane world. To keep the emblems and
tokens of North Pargiter - the man Maggie laughs at; the Frenchman
holding his hat; but at the same time spread out, make a new ripple
in human consciousness, be the bubble and the stream, the stream
and the bubble - myself and the world together - he raised his glass.
Anonymously, he said, looking at the clear yellow liquid. But what
do I mean, he wondered - I, to whom ceremonies are suspect, and
religion's dead; who don't  fit, as the man said, don't  fit in
anywhere? He paused. There was the glass in his hand; in his mind
a sentence. And he wanted to make other sentences. But how can I,
he thought - he looked at Eleanor, who sat with a silk handkerchief
in her hands - unless I know what's solid, what's true; in my life,
in other people's lives?



"Runcorn's boy," Eleanor suddenly ejaculated. "The son of the
porter at my flat," she explained. She had untied the knot in her
handkerchief.

"The son of the porter at your flat," Edward repeated. His eyes
were like a field on which the sun rests in winter, North thought,
looking up - the winter's sun, that has no heat left in it but some
pale beauty.

"Commissionaire they call him, I think," she said.

"How I hate that word!" said Edward with a little shudder.
"Porter's good English, isn't  it?"

"That's what I say," said Eleanor. "The son of the PORTER at my
flat. . . . Well, he wants, they want him to go to college. So I
said if I saw you, I'd ask you - "

"Of course, of course," said Edward kindly.

And that's all right, North said to himself. That's the human
voice at its natural speaking level. Of course, of course, he
repeated.

"He wants to go to college, does he?" Edward went on. "What
examinations has he passed, eh?"

What examinations has he passed, eh? North repeated. He repeated
that too, but critically, as if he were actor and critic; he
listened but he commented. He surveyed the thin yellow liquid in
which the bubbles rose more slowly, one by one. Eleanor did not
know what examinations he had passed. And what was I thinking?
North asked himself. He felt that he had been in the middle of a
jungle; in the heart of darkness; cutting his way towards the
light; but provided only with broken sentences, single words, with
which to break through the briar-bush of human bodies, human wills
and voices, that bent over him, binding him, blinding him. . . .
He listened.

"Well then, tell him to come and see me," said Edward, briskly.

"But that's asking too much of you, Edward?" Eleanor protested.

"That's what I'm for," said Edward.

That's the right tone of voice too, North thought. Not carapaced - 
the words "caparison" and "carapace" collided in his mind, and made
a new word that was no word. What I mean is, he added, taking a
drink of his claret cup, underneath there's the fountain; the sweet
nut. The fruit, the fountain that's in all of us; in Edward; in
Eleanor; so why caparison ourselves on top? He looked up.

A big man had stopped in front of them. He bent over and very
politely gave Eleanor his hand. He had to bend, for his white
waistcoat enclosed so magnificent a sphere. "Alas," he was saying
in a voice that was oddly mellifluous for one of his bulk, "I'd
love nothing more; but I have a meeting at ten tomorrow morning."
They were inviting him to sit down and talk. He was tittupping up
and down on his little feet in front of them.

"Throw it over!" said Eleanor, smiling up at him, just as she used
to smile when she was a girl with her brother's friends, thought
North. Then why hadn't  she married one of them, he wondered. Why
do we hide all the things that matter? he asked himself.

"And leave my directors cooling their heels? As much as my place
is worth!" the old friend was saying, and swung round on his heel
with the agility of a trained elephant.

"Seems a long time since he acted in the Greek play, doesn't  it?"
said Edward. ". . . in a toga," he added with a grin, following
the well-rounded person of the great railway magnate as he went
with a certain celerity, for he was a perfect man of the world,
through the crowd to the door.

"That's Chipperfield, the great railway man," he explained to
North. "A very remarkable fellow," he went on. "Son of a railway
porter." He made little pauses between each sentence. "Done it
all off his own bat. . . . A delightful house . . . Perfectly
restored. . . . Two or three hundred acres, I suppose. . . . Has
his shooting. . . . Asks me to direct his reading. . . . And buys
old masters."

"And buys old masters," North repeated. The deft little sentences
seemed to build up a pagoda; sparely but accurately; and through it
all ran some queer breath of mockery tinged with affection.

"Shams, I should think," Eleanor laughed.

"Well, we needn't  go into that," Edward chuckled. Then they were
silent. The pagoda floated off. Chipperfield had vanished through
the door.



"How nice this drink is," Eleanor said above his head. North could
see her glass held at the level of his head on her knee. A thin
green leaf floated on top of it. "I hope it's not intoxicating?"
she said, raising it.

North took up his glass again. What was I thinking last time I
looked at it? he asked himself. A block had formed in his forehead
as if two thoughts had collided and had stopped the passage of the
rest. His mind was a blank. He swayed the liquid from side to
side. He was in the middle of a dark forest.

"So, North . . ." His own name roused him with a start. It was
Edward speaking. He jerked forward. ". . . you want to brush up
your classics, do you?" Edward went on. "I'm glad to hear you say
that. There's a lot in those old fellows. But the younger
generation," he paused, ". . . don't  seem to want 'em."

"How foolish!" said Eleanor. "I was reading one of them the other
day . . . the one you translated. Now which was it?" She paused.
She never could remember names. "The one about the girl who . . ."

"The Antigone?" Edward suggested.

"Yes! The Antigone!" she exclaimed. "And I thought to myself,
just what you say, Edward - how true - how beautiful. . . ."

She broke off, as if afraid to continue.

Edward nodded. He paused. Then suddenly he jerked his head back
and said some words in Greek: " Greek text ."

North looked up.

"Translate it," he said.

Edward shook his head. "It's the language," he said.

Then he shut up. It's no go, North thought. He can't  say what he
wants to say; he's afraid. They're all afraid; afraid of being
laughed at; afraid of giving themselves away. He's afraid too, he
thought, looking at the young man with a fine forehead and a weak
chin who was gesticulating too emphatically. We're all afraid of
each other, he thought; afraid of what? Of criticism; of laughter;
of people who think differently. . . . He's afraid of me because
I'm a farmer  and he saw again his round face; high cheek-bones and
small brown eyes . And I'm afraid of him because he's clever. He
looked at the big forehead, from which the hair was already
receding. That's what separates us; fear, he thought.

He shifted his position. He wanted to get up and talk to him.
Delia had said, "Don't  wait to be introduced." But it was
difficult to speak to a man whom he did not know, and say: "What's
this knot in the middle of my forehead? Untie it." For he had had
enough of thinking alone. Thinking alone tied knots in the middle
of the forehead; thinking alone bred pictures, foolish pictures.
The man was moving off. He must make the effort. Yet he
hesitated. He felt repelled and attracted, attracted and repelled.
He began to rise; but before he had got on his feet somebody
thumped on a table with a fork.



A large man sitting at a table in the corner was thumping on the
table with his fork. He was leaning forward as if he wanted to
attract attention, as if he were about to make a speech. It was
the man Peggy called Brown; the others called Nicholas; whose real
name he did not know. Perhaps he was a little drunk.

"Ladies and gentlemen!" he said. "Ladies and gentlemen!" he
repeated rather more loudly.

"What, a speech?" said Edward quizzically. He half turned his
chair; he raised his eyeglass, which hung on a black silk ribbon as
if it were a foreign order.

People were buzzing about with plates and glasses. They were
stumbling over cushions on the floor. A girl pitched head
foremost.

"Hurt yourself?" said a young man, stretching out his hand.

No, she had not hurt herself. But the interruption had distracted
attention from the speech. A buzz of talk had risen like the buzz
of flies over sugar. Nicholas sat down again. He was lost
apparently in contemplation of the red stone in his ring; or of the
strewn flowers; the white, waxy flowers, the pale, semi-transparent
flowers, the crimson flowers that were so full-blown that the gold
heart showed, and the petals had fallen and lay among the hired
knives and forks, the cheap tumblers on the table. Then he roused
himself.

"Ladies and gentlemen!" he began. Again he thumped the table with
his fork. There was a momentary lull. Rose marched across the
room.

"Going to make a speech, are you?" she demanded. "Go on, I like
hearing speeches." She stood beside him, with her hand hollowed
round her ear like a military man. Again the buzz of talk had
broken out.

"Silence!" she exclaimed. She took a knife and rapped on the
table.

"Silence! Silence!" She rapped again.

Martin crossed the room.

"What's Rose making such a noise about?" he asked.

"I'm asking for silence!" she said, flourishing her knife in his
face. "This gentleman wants to make a speech!"

But he had sat down and was regarding his ring with equanimity.

"Isn't  she the very spit and image," said Martin, laying his hand
on Rose's shoulder and turning to Eleanor as if to confirm his
words, "of old Uncle Pargiter of Pargiter's Horse?"

"Well, I'm proud of it!" said Rose, brandishing her knife in his
face. "I'm proud of my family; proud of my country; proud of . . ."

"Your sex?" he interrupted her.

"I am," she asseverated. "And what about you?" she went on,
tapping him on the shoulder. "Proud of yourself, are you?"

"Don't  quarrel, children, don't  quarrel!" cried Eleanor, giving her
chair a little edge nearer. "They always would quarrel," she said,
"always . . . always. . . ."

"She was a horrid little spitfire," said Martin, squatting down on
the floor, and looking up at Rose, "with her hair scraped off her
forehead . . ."

". . . wearing a pink frock," Rose added. She sat down abruptly,
holding her knife erect in her hand. "A pink frock; a pink frock,"
she repeated, as if the words recalled something.

"But go on with your speech, Nicholas," said Eleanor, turning to
him. He shook his head.

"Let us talk about pink frocks," he smiled.

". . . in the drawing-room at Abercorn Terrace, when we were
children," said Rose. "D'you remember?" She looked at Martin. He
nodded his head.

"In the drawing-room at Abercorn Terrace . . ." said Delia. She
was going from table to table with a great jug of claret cup. She
stopped in front of them. "Abercorn Terrace!" she exclaimed,
filling a glass. She flung her head back and looked for a moment
astonishingly young, handsome, and defiant.

"It was Hell!" she exclaimed. "It was Hell!" she repeated.

"Oh come, Delia . . ." Martin protested, holding out his glass to
be filled.

"It was Hell," she said, dropping her Irish manner, and speaking
quite simply, as she poured out the drink.

"D'you know," she said, looking at Eleanor, "when I go to
Paddington, I always say to the man, 'Drive the other way round!'"

"That's enough . . ." Martin stopped her; his glass was full. "I
hated it too . . ." he began.

But here Kitty Lasswade advanced upon them. She held her glass in
front of her as though it were a bauble.

"What's Martin hating now?" she said, facing him.

A polite gentleman pushed forward a little gilt chair upon which
she sat down.

"He always was a hater," she said, holding her glass out to be
filled.

"What was it you hated that night, Martin, when you dined with us?"
she asked him. "I remember how angry you made me. . . ."

She smiled at him. He had grown cherubic; pink and plump; with his
hair brushed back like a waiter's.

"Hated? I never hated anybody," he protested.

"My heart's full of love; my heart's full of kindness," he laughed,
waving his glass at her.

"Nonsense," said Kitty. "When you were young you hated . . .
everything!" she flung her hand out. "My house . . . my
friends. . . ." She broke off with a quick little sigh. She
saw them again - the men filing in; the women pinching some dress
between their thumbs and fingers. She lived alone now, in the
north.

". . . and I daresay I'm better off as I am," she added, half to
herself, "with just a boy to chop up wood."

There was a pause.

"Now let him get on with his speech," said Eleanor.

"Yes. Get on with your speech!" said Rose. Again she rapped her
knife on the table; again he half rose.

"Going to make a speech, is he?" said Kitty, turning to Edward who
had drawn his chair up beside her.

"The only place where oratory is now practised as an art . . ."
Edward began. Then he paused, drew his chair a little closer, and
adjusted his glasses, ". . . is the church," he added.

That's why I didn't  marry you, Kitty said to herself. How the
voice, the supercilious voice, brought it back! the tree half
fallen; rain falling; undergraduates calling; bells tolling; she
and her mother. . . .

But Nicholas had risen. He took a deep breath which expanded his
shirt front. With one hand he fumbled with his fob; the other he
flung out with an oratorical gesture.

"Ladies and gentlemen!" he began again. "In the name of all who
have enjoyed themselves tonight. . . ."

"Speak up! Speak up!" the young men cried who were standing in the
window.

 "Is he a foreigner?" Kitty whispered to Eleanor. 

". . . in the name of all who have enjoyed themselves tonight," he
repeated more loudly, "I wish to thank our host and hostess. . . ."

"Oh, don't  thank me!" said Delia brushing past them with her empty
jug.

Again the speech was brought to the ground. He must be a
foreigner, Kitty thought to herself, because he has no self-
consciousness. There he stood holding his wine-glass and smiling.

"Go on, go on," she urged him. "Don't  mind them." She was in the
mood for a speech. A speech was a good thing at parties. It gave
them a fillip. It gave them a finish. She rapped her glass on the
table.

"It's very nice of you," said Delia, trying to push past him, but
he had laid his hand on her arm, "but don't  thank me."

"But Delia," he expostulated, still holding her, "it's not what YOU
want; it's what WE want. And it is fitting," he continued, waving
his hand out, "when our hearts are full of gratitude. . ."

Now he's getting into his stride, Kitty thought. I daresay he's a
bit of an orator. Most foreigners are.

". . . when our hearts are full of gratitude," he repeated,
touching one finger.

"What for?" said a voice abruptly.

Nicholas stopped again.

 "Who is that dark man?" Kitty whispered to Eleanor. "I've  been
wondering all the evening."

"Renny," Eleanor whispered. "Renny," she repeated. 

"What for?" said Nicholas. "That is what I am about to tell
you. . . ." He paused, and drew a deep breath which again expanded
his waistcoat. His eyes beamed; he seemed full of spontaneous
subterraneous benevolence. But here a head popped up over the edge
of the table; a hand swept up a fistful of flower petals; and a
voice cried:

"Red Rose, thorny Rose, brave Rose, tawny Rose!" The petals were
thrown, fan-shape, over the stout old woman who was sitting on the
edge of her chair. She looked up in surprise. Petals had fallen
on her. She brushed them where they had lodged upon the
prominences of her person. "Thank you! Thank you!" she exclaimed.
Then she took up a flower and beat it energetically upon the edge
of the table. "But I want my speech!" she said, looking at
Nicholas.

"No, no," he said. "This is not a time for making speeches," and
sat down again.

"Let's drink then," said Martin. He raised his glass. "Pargiter
of Pargiter's Horse!" he said. "I drink to her!" He put his glass
down with a thump on the table.

"Oh, if you're all drinking healths," said Kitty, "I'll drink too.
Rose, your health. Rose is a fine fellow," she said, raising her
glass. "But Rose was wrong," she added. "Force is always wrong, - 
don't  you agree with me, Edward?" She tapped him on the knee. I'd
forgotten the War, she muttered half to herself. "Still," she said
aloud, "Rose had the courage of her convictions. Rose went to
prison. And I drink to her!" She drank.

"The same to you, Kitty," said Rose, bowing to her.

"She smashed his window," Martin jeered at her, "and then she
helped him to smash other people's windows. Where's your
decoration, Rose?"

"In a cardboard box on the mantelpiece," said Rose. "You can't  get
a rise out of me at this time of day, my good fellow."

"But I wish you had let Nicholas finish his speech," said Eleanor.



Down through the ceiling, muted and far away, came the preliminary
notes of another dance. The young people, hastily swallowing what
remained in their glasses, rose and began to move off upstairs.
Soon there was the sound of feet thudding, rhythmically, heavily on
the floor above.

"Another dance?" said Eleanor. It was a waltz. "When we were
young," she said, looking at Kitty, "we used to dance. . . ." The
tune seemed to take her words and to repeat them - when I was young
I used to dance - I used to dance. . . .

"And how I hated it!" said Kitty, looking at her fingers, which
were short and pricked. "How nice it is," she said, "not to be
young! How nice not to mind what people think! Now one can live
as one likes," she added, ". . . now that one's seventy."

She paused. She raised her eyebrows as if she remembered
something. "Pity one can't  live again," she said. But she broke
off.

"Aren't  we going to have our speech after all, Mr - ?" she said,
looking at Nicholas, whose name she did not know. He sat gazing
benevolently in front of him, paddling his hands among the flower
petals.

"What's the good?" he said. "Nobody wants to listen." They
listened to the feet thudding upstairs, and to the music repeating,
it seemed to Eleanor, when I was young I used to dance, all men
loved me when I was young. . . .

"But I want a speech!" said Kitty in her authoritative manner. It
was true; she wanted something - something that gave a fillip, a
finish - what she scarcely knew. But not the past - not memories.
The present; the future; that was what she wanted.

"There's Peggy!" said Eleanor, looking round. She was sitting on
the edge of a table, eating a ham sandwich.

"Come, Peggy!" she called out. "Come and talk to us!"

"Speak for the younger generation, Peggy!" said Lady Lasswade,
shaking hands.

"But I'm not the younger generation," said Peggy. "And I've  made
my speech already," she said. "I made a fool of myself upstairs,"
she said, sinking down on the floor at Eleanor's feet.

"Then, North . . ." said Eleanor, looking down on the parting of
North's hair as he sat on the floor beside her.

"Yes, North," said Peggy, looking at him across her aunt's knee.
"North says we talk of nothing but money and politics," she added.
"Tell us what we ought to do." He started. He had been dozing
off, dazed by the music and voices. What we ought to do? he said
to himself, waking up. What ought we to do?

He jerked up into a sitting posture. He saw Peggy's face looking
at him. Now she was smiling; her face was gay; it reminded him of
his grandmother's face in the picture. But he saw it as he had
seen it upstairs - scarlet, puckered - as if she were about to burst
into tears. It was her face that was true; not her words. But
only her words returned to him - to live differently - differently.
He paused. This is what needs courage, he said to himself; to
speak the truth. She was listening. The old people were already
gossiping about their own affairs.

". . . It's a nice little house," Kitty was saying. "An old mad
woman used to live there. . . . You'll have to come and stay with
me, Nell. In the spring. . . ."

Peggy was watching him over the rim of her ham sandwich.

"What you said was true," he blurted out, ". . . quite true." It
was what she meant that was true, he corrected himself; her
feeling, not her words. He felt her feeling now; it was not
about him; it was about other people; about another world, a new
world. . . .

The old aunts and uncles were gossiping above him.

"What was the name of the man I used to like so much at Oxford?"
Lady Lasswade was saying. He could see her silver body bending
towards Edward.

"The man you liked at Oxford?" Edward was repeating. "I thought
you never liked anyone at Oxford. . . ." And they laughed.

But Peggy was waiting, she was watching him. He saw again the
glass with the bubbles rising; he felt again the constriction of a
knot in his forehead. He wished there were someone, infinitely
wise and good, to think for him, to answer for him. But the young
man with the receding forehead had vanished.

". . . To live differently . . . differently," he repeated. Those
were her words; they did not altogether fit his meaning; but he had
to use them. Now I've  made a fool of myself too, he thought, as a
ripple of some disagreeable sensation went across his back as if a
knife had sliced it, and he leant against the wall.

"Yes, it was Robson!" Lady Lasswade exclaimed. Her trumpet voice
rang out over his head.

"How one forgets things!" she went on. "Of course - Robson. That
was his name. And the girl I used to like - Nelly? The girl who
was going to be a doctor?"

"Died, I think," said Edward.

"Died, did she - died - " said Lady Lasswade. She paused for a
moment. "Well, I wish you'd make your speech," she said, turning
and looking down at North.

He drew himself back. No more speech-making for me, he thought.
He had his glass in his hand still. It was still half full of pale
yellow liquid. The bubbles had ceased to rise. The wine was clear
and still. Stillness and solitude, he thought to himself; silence
and solitude . . . that's the only element in which the mind is
free now.

Silence and solitude, he repeated; silence and solitude. His eyes
half closed themselves. He was tired; he was dazed; people talked;
people talked. He would detach himself, generalise himself,
imagine that he was lying in a great space on a blue plain with
hills on the rim of the horizon. He stretched out his feet. There
were the sheep cropping; slowly tearing the grass; advancing first
one stiff leg and then another. And babbling - babbling. He made
no sense of what they were saying. Through his half-open eyes he
saw hands holding flowers - thin hands, fine hands; but hands that
belonged to no one. And were they flowers the hands held? Or
mountains? Blue mountains with violet shadows? Then petals fell.
Pink, yellow, white with violet shadows, the petals fell. They
fall and fall and cover all, he murmured. And there was the stem
of a wine-glass; the rim of a plate; and a bowl of water. The
hands went on picking up flower after flower; that was a white
rose; that was a yellow rose; that was a rose with violet valleys
in its petals. There they hung, many folded, many coloured,
drooping over the rim of the bowl. And petals fell. There they
lay, violet and yellow, little shallops, boats on a river. And he
was floating, and drifting, in a shallop, in a petal, down a river
into silence, into solitude . . . which is the worst torture, the
words came back to him as if a voice had spoken them, that human
beings can inflict. . . .

"Wake up, North . . . we want your speech!" a voice interrupted
him. Kitty's red handsome face was hanging over him.

"Maggie!" he exclaimed, pulling himself up. It was she who was
sitting there, putting flowers into water. "Yes, it's Maggie's
turn to speak," said Nicholas, putting his hand on her knee.

"Speak, speak!" Renny urged her.

But she shook her head. Laughter took her and shook her. She
laughed, throwing her head back as if she were possessed by some
genial spirit outside herself that made her bend and rise, as a
tree, North thought, is tossed and bent by the wind. No idols, no
idols, no idols, her laughter seemed to chime as if the tree were
hung with innumerable bells, and he laughed too.



Their laughter ceased. Feet thudded, dancing on the floor above.
A siren hooted on the river. A van crashed down the street in the
distance. There was a rush and quiver of sound; something seemed
to be released; it was as if the life of the day were about to
begin, and this were the chorus, the cry, the chirp, the stir,
which salutes the London dawn.

Kitty turned to Nicholas.

"And what was your speech going to have been about, Mr . . . I'm
afraid I don't  know your name?" she said.

". . . the one that was interrupted?"

"My speech?" he laughed. "It was to have been a miracle!" he said.
"A masterpiece! But how can one speak when one is always
interrupted? I begin: I say, Let us give thanks. Then Delia says,
Don't  thank me. I begin again: I say, Let us give thanks to
someone, to somebody . . . And Renny says, What for? I begin
again, and look - Eleanor is sound asleep."  He pointed at her. 
"So what's the good?"

"Oh, but there is some good - " Kitty began.

She still wanted something - some finish, some fillip - what she did
not know. And it was getting late. She must go.

"Tell me, privately, what you were going to have said, Mr - ?" she
asked him.

"What I was going to have said? I was going to have said - " he
paused and stretched his hand out; he touched each finger
separately.

"First I was going to have thanked our host and hostess. Then I
was going to have thanked this house - " he waved his hand round the
room hung with the placards of the house agent, " - which has
sheltered the lovers, the creators, the men and women of goodwill.
And finally - " he took his glass in his hand, "I was going to drink
to the human race. The human race," he continued, raising his
glass to his lips, "which is now in its infancy, may it grow to
maturity! Ladies and gentlemen!" he exclaimed, half rising and
expanding his waistcoat, "I drink to that!"

He brought his glass down with a thump on the table. It broke.



"That's the thirteenth glass broken tonight!" said Delia, coming up
and stopping in front of them. "But don't  mind - don't  mind.
They're very cheap - glasses."

"What's very cheap?" Eleanor murmured. She half opened her eyes.
But where was she? In what room? In which of the innumerable
rooms? Always there were rooms; always there were people. Always
from the beginning of time. . . . She shut her hands on the coins
she was holding, and again she was suffused with a feeling of
happiness. Was it because this had survived - this keen sensation
 she was waking up  and the other thing, the solid object - she saw
an ink-corroded walrus - had vanished? She opened her eyes wide.
Here she was; alive; in this room, with living people. She saw all
the heads in a circle. At first they were without identity. Then
she recognised them. That was Rose; that was Martin; that was
Morris. He had hardly any hair on the top of his head. There was
a curious pallor on his face.

There was a curious pallor on all their faces as she looked round.
The brightness had gone out of the electric lights; the table-
cloths looked whiter. North's head - he was sitting on the floor at
her feet - was rimmed with whiteness. His shirt-front was a little
crumpled.

He was sitting on the floor at Edward's feet with his hands bound
round his knees, and he gave little jerks and looked up at him as
if he appealed to him about something.

"Uncle Edward," she heard him say, "tell me this . . ."

He was like a child asking to be told a story.

"Tell me this," he repeated, giving another little jerk. "You're a
scholar. About the classics now. Aeschylus. Sophocles. Pindar."

Edward bent towards him.

"And the chorus," North jerked on again. She leant towards them.
"The chorus - " North repeated.

"My dear boy," she heard Edward say as he smiled benignly down at
him, "don't  ask me. I was never a great hand at that. No, if I'd
had my way" - he paused and passed his hand over his forehead - "I
should have been . . ." A burst of laughter drowned his words.
She could not catch the end of the sentence. What had he said - 
what had he wished to be? She had lost his words.

There must be another life, she thought, sinking back into her
chair, exasperated. Not in dreams; but here and now, in this room,
with living people. She felt as if she were standing on the edge
of a precipice with her hair blown back; she was about to grasp
something that just evaded her. There must be another life, here
and now, she repeated. This is too short, too broken. We know
nothing, even about ourselves. We're only just beginning, she
thought, to understand, here and there. She hollowed her hands in
her lap, just as Rose had hollowed hers round her ears. She held
her hands hollowed; she felt that she wanted to enclose the present
moment; to make it stay; to fill it fuller and fuller, with the
past, the present and the future, until it shone, whole, bright,
deep with understanding.

"Edward," she began, trying to attract his attention. But he was
not listening to her; he was telling North some old college story.
It's useless, she thought, opening her hands. It must drop. It
must fall. And then? she thought. For her too there would be the
endless night; the endless dark. She looked ahead of her as though
she saw opening in front of her a very long dark tunnel. But,
thinking of the dark, something baffled her; in fact it was growing
light. The blinds were white.



There was a stir in the room.

Edward turned to her.

"Who are THEY?" he asked her, pointing to the door.

She looked. Two children stood in the door. Delia had her hands
on their shoulders as if to encourage them. She was leading them
over to the table in order to give them something to eat. They
looked awkward and clumsy.

Eleanor glanced at their hands, at their clothes, at the shape of
their ears. "The children of the caretaker, I should think," she
said. Yes, Delia was cutting slices of cake for them, and they
were larger slices of cake than she would have cut had they been
the children of her own friends. The children took the slices and
stared at them with a curious fixed stare as if they were fierce.
But perhaps they were frightened, because she had brought them up
from the basement into the drawing-room.

"Eat it!" said Delia, giving them a little pat.

They began to munch slowly, gazing solemnly round them.

"Hullo, children!" cried Martin, beckoning to them. They stared at
him solemnly.

"Haven't  you got a name?" he said. They went on eating in silence.
He began to fumble in his pocket.

"Speak!" he said. "Speak!"

"The younger generation," said Peggy, "don't  mean to speak."

They turned their eyes on her now; but they went on munching. "No
school tomorrow?" she said. They shook their heads from side to
side.

"Hurrah!" said Martin. He held the coins in his hand; pressed
between his thumb and finger. "Now - sing a song for sixpence!" he
said.

"Yes. Weren't  you taught something at school?" Peggy asked.

They stared at her but remained silent. They had stopped eating.
They were a centre of a little group. They swept their eyes over
the grown-up people for a moment, then, each giving the other a
little nudge, they burst into song:


 Etho passo tanno hai,
 Fai donk to tu do,
 Mai to, kai to, lai to see
 Toh dom to tuh do - 


That was what it sounded like. Not a word was recognisable. The
distorted sounds rose and sank as if they followed a tune. They
stopped.

They stood with their hands behind their backs. Then with one
impulse they attacked the next verse:


 Fanno to par, etto to mar,
 Timin tudo, tido,
 Foll to gar in, mitno to par,
 Eido, teido, meido - 


They sang the second verse more fiercely than the first. The
rhythm seemed to rock and the unintelligible words ran themselves
together almost into a shriek. The grown-up people did not know
whether to laugh or to cry. Their voices were so harsh; the accent
was so hideous.

They burst out again:


 Chree to gay ei,
 Geeray didax. . . .


Then they stopped. It seemed to be in the middle of a verse. They
stood there grinning, silent, looking at the floor. Nobody knew
what to say. There was something horrible in the noise they made.
It was so shrill, so discordant, and so meaningless. Then old
Patrick ambled up.

"Ah, that's very nice, that's very nice. Thank you, my dears," he
said in his genial way, fiddling with his toothpick. The children
grinned at him. Then they began to make off. As they sidled past
Martin, he slipped coins into their hands. Then they made a dash
for the door.

"But what the devil were they singing?" said Hugh Gibbs. "I
couldn't  understand a word of it, I must confess." He held his
hands to the sides of his large white waistcoat.

"Cockney accent, I suppose," said Patrick. "What they teach 'em at
school, you know."

"But it was . . ." Eleanor began. She stopped. What was it? As
they stood there they had looked so dignified; yet they had made
this hideous noise. The contrast between their faces and their
voices was astonishing; it was impossible to find one word for the
whole. "Beautiful?" she said, with a note of interrogation,
turning to Maggie.

"Extraordinarily," said Maggie.

But Eleanor was not sure that they were thinking of the same thing.



She gathered together her gloves, her bag and two or three coppers,
and got up. The room was full of a queer pale light. Objects
seemed to be rising out of their sleep, out of their disguise, and
to be assuming the sobriety of daily life. The room was making
ready for its use as an estate agent's office. The tables were
becoming office tables; their legs were the legs of office tables,
and yet they were still strewn with plates and glasses, with roses,
lilies and carnations.

"It's time to go," she said, crossing the room. Delia had gone to
the window. Now she jerked the curtains open.

"The dawn!" she exclaimed rather melodramatically.

The shapes of houses appeared across the square. Their blinds were
all drawn; they seemed fast asleep still in the morning pallor.

"The dawn!" said Nicholas, getting up and stretching himself. He
too walked across to the window. Renny followed him.

"Now for the peroration," he said, standing with him in the window.
"The dawn - the new day - "

He pointed at the trees, at the roofs, at the sky.

"No," said Nicholas, holding back the curtain. "There you are
mistaken. There is going to be no peroration - no peroration!" he
exclaimed, throwing his arm out, "because there was no speech."

"But the dawn has risen," said Renny, pointing at the sky.



It was a fact. The sun had risen. The sky between the chimneys
looked extraordinarily blue.

"And I am going to bed," said Nicholas after a pause. He turned
away.

"Where is Sara?" he said, looking round him. There she was curled
up in a corner with her head against a table asleep apparently.

"Wake your sister, Magdalena," he said, turning to Maggie. Maggie
looked at her. Then she took a flower from the table and tossed it
at her. She half-opened her eyes. "It's time," said Maggie,
touching her on the shoulder. "Time, is it?" she sighed. She
yawned and stretched herself. She fixed her eyes on Nicholas as if
she were bringing him back to the field of vision. Then she
laughed.

"Nicholas!" she exclaimed.

"Sara!" he replied. They smiled at each other. Then he helped her
up and she balanced herself uncertainly against her sister, and
rubbed her eyes.

"How strange," she murmured, looking round heir, ". . . how
strange. . . ."

There were the smeared plates, and the empty wine-glasses; the
petals and the bread crumbs. In the mixture of lights they looked
prosaic but unreal; cadaverous but brilliant. And there against
the window, gathered in a group, were the old brothers and sisters.

"Look, Maggie," she whispered, turning to her sister, "Look!" She
pointed at the Pargiters, standing in the window.



The group in the window, the men in their black-and-white evening
dress, the women in their crimsons, golds and silvers, wore a
statuesque air for a moment, as if they were carved in stone.
Their dresses fell in stiff sculptured folds. Then they moved;
they changed their attitudes; they began to talk.

"Can't  I give you a lift back, Nell?" Kitty Lasswade was saying.
"I've  a car waiting."

Eleanor did not answer. She was looking at the curtained houses
across the square. The windows were spotted with gold. Everything
looked clean swept, fresh and virginal. The pigeons were shuffling
on the tree tops.

"I've  a car . . ." Kitty repeated.

"Listen . . ." said Eleanor, raising her hand. Upstairs they were
playing "God save the King" on the gramophone; but it was the
pigeons she meant; they were crooning.

"That's wood pigeons, isn't  it?" said Kitty. She put her head on
one side to listen. Take two coos, Taffy, take two coos . . .
tak . . . they were crooning.

"Wood pigeons?" said Edward, putting his hand to his ear.

"There on the tree tops," said Kitty. The green-blue birds were
shuffling about on the branches, pecking and crooning to
themselves.

Morris brushed the crumbs off his waistcoat.

"What an hour for us old fogies to be out of bed!" he said. "I
haven't  seen the sun rise since . . . since. . . ."

"Ah, but when we were young," said old Patrick, slapping him on the
shoulder, "we thought nothing of making a night of it! I remember
going to Covent Garden and buying roses for a certain lady. . ."

Delia smiled as if some romance, her own or another's, had been
recalled to her.

"And I . . ." Eleanor began. She stopped. She saw an empty milk
jug and leaves falling. Then it had been autumn. Now it was
summer. The sky was a faint blue; the roofs were tinged purple
against the blue; the chimneys were a pure brick red. An air of
ethereal calm and simplicity lay over everything.

"And all the tubes have stopped, and all the omnibuses," she said
turning round. "How are we going to get home?"

"We can walk," said Rose. "Walking won't  do us any harm."

"Not on a fine summer morning," said Martin.

A breeze went through the square. In the stillness they could hear
the branches rustle as they rose slightly, and fell, and shook a
wave of green light through the air.

Then the door burst open. Couple after couple came flocking in,
dishevelled, gay, to look for their cloaks and their hats, to say
good-night.

"It's been so good of you to come!" Delia exclaimed, turning
towards them with her hands outstretched.

"Thank you - thank you for coming!" she cried.

"And look at Maggie's bunch!" she said, taking a bunch of many
coloured flowers that Maggie held out to her.

"How beautifully you've  arranged them!" she said. "Look, Eleanor!"
She turned to her sister.

But Eleanor was standing with her back to them. She was watching a
taxi that was gliding slowly round the square. It stopped in front
of a house two doors down.

"Aren't  they lovely?" said Delia, holding out the flowers.

Eleanor started.

"The roses? Yes . . ." she said. But she was watching the cab. A
young man had got out; he paid the driver. Then a girl in a tweed
travelling suit followed him. He fitted his latch-key to the door.
"There," Eleanor murmured, as he opened the door and they stood for
a moment on the threshold. "There!" she repeated, as the door shut
with a little thud behind them.

Then she turned round into the room. "And now?" she said, looking
at Morris, who was drinking the last drops of a glass of wine.
"And now?" she asked, holding out her hands to him.



The sun had risen, and the sky above the houses wore an air of
extraordinary beauty, simplicity and peace.



THE END
