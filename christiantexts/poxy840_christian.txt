The following 
                translation is based on the reconstructed Greek text printed in 
                Henry Sweet Barclay's "Two New Gospel Fragments" from Hans Lietzmann's 
                Kleine Texte für Vorlesungen 
                und Übungen. Information about the manuscript was gathered 
                from Bernard P. Grenfell and Arthur S. Hunt's Fragment 
                of an Uncanonical Gospel.

                . . earlier, before doing wrong, he slyly reasons everything out. 
                Be careful that you do not end up suffering the same fate as them. 
                For the evil-doers of humanity receive retribution not only among 
                the living, but they will also undergo punishment and much torture 
                later." 
Taking 
                them along, he went into the place of purification itself and 
                wandered around in the temple. Then a certain high priest of the 
                Pharisees named Levi came toward them and said to the savior, 
                "Who permitted you to wander in this place of purification 
                and to see these holy vessels, even though you have not bathed 
                and the feet of your disciples have not been washed? And now that 
                you have defiled it, you walk around in this pure area of the 
                temple where only a person who has bathed and changed his clothes 
                can walk, and even such a person does not dare to look upon these 
                holy vessels." 
Standing 
                nearby with his disciples, the savior replied, "Since you 
                are here in the temple too, are you clean?" 
The 
                Pharisee said to him, "I am clean. For I bathed in the pool 
                of David. I went down into the pool by one set of stairs and came 
                back out by another. Then I put on white clothes and they were 
                clean. And then I came and looked at these holy vessels." 
                
Replying 
                to him, the savior said, "Woe to blind people who do not 
                see! You have washed in the gushing waters that dogs and pigs 
                are thrown into day and night. And when you washed yourself, you 
                scrubbed the outer layer of skin, the layer of skin that prostitutes 
                and flute-girls anoint and wash and scrub when they put on make 
                up to become the desire of the men. But inside they are filled 
                with scorpions and all unrighteousness. But my disciples and I, 
                whom you say have not washed, we have washed in waters of eternal 
                life that come from the God of heaven. But woe to those . . . 
                "

                (22) wit[h his] disciple[s replied],
Recto
(23) 
                "Then, being here in the temple, are you
                (24) clean?" He said to him, "I am clean.
                (25) For I bathed in the pool of David and
                (26) after going down by one set of stairs, by another

                (31) said, "Woe to blind people who do not
