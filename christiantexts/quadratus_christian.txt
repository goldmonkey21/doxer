Fragments of Quadratus of Athens












Quadratus, Bishop of 
Athens. 

------------
[a.d. 126.] Quadratus 
is spoken of by Eusebius as a "man of understanding and of Apostolic faith." And 
he celebrates Aristides as a man of similar character. These were the earliest 
apologists; both addressed their writings to Hadrian, and they were extant and 
valued in the churches in the time of Eusebius.

From the Apology for the Christian 
  Religion. 
  
Our Saviour's works, moreover, were always present: for they were real, 
consisting of those who had been healed of their diseases, those who had 
been raised from the dead; who were not only seen whilst they were being healed 
and raised up, but were afterwards constantly present. Nor did they 
remain only during the sojourn of the Saviour on earth, but also a 
considerable time after His departure; and, indeed, some of them have survived 
even down to our own times.
