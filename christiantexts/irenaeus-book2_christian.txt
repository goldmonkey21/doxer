Book II
--------

Preface.
1. In the first book, which immediately precedes this, exposing "knowledge 
falsely so called,"
I showed thee, my very dear friend, that the whole system devised, in many and 
opposite ways, by those who are of the school of Valentinus, was false and 
baseless. I also set forth the tenets of their predecessors, proving that they 
not only differed among themselves, but had long previously swerved from the 
truth itself. I further explained, with all diligence, the doctrine as well as 
practice of Marcus the magician, since he, too, belongs to these persons; and I 
carefully noticed
the passages which they garble from the Scriptures, with the view of adapting 
them to their own fictions. Moreover, I minutely narrated the manner in which, 
by means of numbers, and by the twenty-four letters of the alphabet, they boldly 
endeavour to establish [what they regard as] truth. I have also related how they 
think and teach that creation at large was formed after the image of their 
invisible Pleroma, and what they hold respecting the Demiurge, declaring at the 
same time the doctrine of Simon Magus of Samaria, their progenitor, and of all 
those who succeeded him. I mentioned, too, the multitude of those Gnostics who 
are sprung from him, and noticed
the points of difference between them, their several doctrines, and the order of 
their succession, while I set forth all those heresies which have been 
originated by them. I showed, moreover, that all these heretics, taking their 
rise from Simon, have introduced impious and irreligious doctrines into this 
life; and I explained the nature of their "redemption," and their method of 
initiating those who are rendered "perfect," along with their invocations and 
their mysteries. I proved also that there is one God, the Creator, and that He 
is not the fruit of any defect, nor is there anything either above Him, or after 
Him.
2. In the present book, I shall establish those points which fit in with my 
design, so far as time permits, and overthrow, by means of lengthened treatment 
under distinct heads, their whole system; for which reason, since it is an 
exposure and subversion of their opinions, I have so entitled the composition of 
this work. For it is fitting, by a plain revelation and overthrow of their 
conjunctions, to put an end to these hidden alliances, 
and to Bythus himself, and thus to obtain a demonstration that he never existed 
at any previous time, nor now has any existence.

Chapter I.-There is But One God: the 
  Impossibility of Its Being Otherwise.
1. IT is proper, then, that I should begin with the first and most important 
head, that is, God the Creator, who made the heaven and the earth, and all 
things that are therein (whom these men blasphemously style the fruit of a 
defect), and to demonstrate that there is nothing either above Him or after Him; 
nor that, influenced by any one, but of His own free will, He created all 
things, since He is the only God, the only Lord, the only Creator, the only 
Father, alone containing all things, and Himself commanding all things into 
existence.
2. For how can there be any other Fulness, or Principle, or Power, or God, 
above Him, since it is matter of necessity that God, the Pleroma (Fulness) of 
all these, should contain all things in His immensity, and should be contained 
by no one? But if there is anything beyond Him, He is not then the Pleroma of 
all, nor does He contain all. For that which they declare to be beyond Him will 
be wanting to the Pleroma, or, [in other words, ] to that God who is above all 
things. But that which is wanting, and falls in any way short, is not the 
Pleroma of all things. In such a case, He would have both beginning, middle, and 
end, with respect to those who are beyond Him. And if He has an end in regard to 
those things which are below, He has also a beginning with respect to those 
things which are above. In like manner, there is an absolute necessity that He 
should experience the very same thing at all other points, and should be held 
in, bounded, and enclosed by those existences that are outside of Him. For that 
being who is the end downwards, necessarily circumscribes and surrounds him who 
finds his end in it. And thus, according to them, the Father of all (that is, He 
whom they call Pro√∂n and Proarche), with their Pleroma, and the good God of 
Marcion, is established and enclosed in some other, and is surrounded from 
without by another mighty Being, who must of necessity be greater, inasmuch as 
that which contains is greater than that which is contained. But then that which 
is greater is also stronger, and in a greater degree Lord; and that which is 
greater, and stronger, and in a greater degree Lord-must be God.
3. Now, since there exists, according to them, also something else which they 
declare to be outside of the Pleroma, into which they further hold there 
descended that higher power who went astray, it is in every way necessary that 
the Pleroma either contains that which is beyond, yet is contained (for 
otherwise, it will not be beyond the Pleroma; for if there is anything beyond 
the Pleroma, there will be a Pleroma within this very Pleroma which they declare 
to be outside of the Pleroma, and the Pleroma will be contained by that which is 
beyond: and with the Pleroma is understood also the first God); or, again, they 
must be an infinite distance separated from each other-the Pleroma [I mean], and 
that which is beyond it. But if they maintain this, there will then be a third 
kind of existence, which separates by immensity the Pleroma and that which is 
beyond it. This third kind of existence will therefore bound and contain both 
the others, and will be greater both than the Pleroma, and than that which is 
beyond it, inasmuch as it contains both in its bosom. In this way, talk might go 
on for ever concerning those things which are contained, and those which 
contain. For if this third existence has its beginning above, and its end 
beneath, there is an absolute necessity that it be also bounded on the sides, 
either beginning or ceasing at certain other points, [where new existences 
begin.] These, again, and others which are above and below, will have their 
beginnings at certain other points, and so on ad infinitum; so that their 
thoughts would never rest in one God, but, in consequence of seeking after more 
than exists, would wander away to that which has no existence, and depart from 
the true God.
4. These remarks are, in like manner, applicable against the followers of 
Marcion. For his two gods will also be contained and circumscribed by an immense 
interval which separates them from one another. But then there is a necessity to 
suppose a multitude of gods separated by an immense distance from each other on 
every side, beginning with one another, and ending in one another. Thus, by that 
very process of reasoning on which they depend for teaching that there is a 
certain Pleroma or God above the Creator of heaven and earth, any one who 
chooses to employ it may maintain that there is another Pleroma above the 
Pleroma, above that again another, and above Bythus another ocean of Deity, 
while in like manner the same successions hold with respect to the sides; and 
thus, their doctrine flowing out into immensity, there will always be a 
necessity to conceive of other Pleroma, and other Bythi, so as never at any time 
to stop, but always to continue seeking for others besides those already 
mentioned. Moreover, it will be uncertain whether these which we conceive of are 
below, or are, in fact, themselves the things which are above; and, in like 
manner, will be doubtful] respecting those things which are said by them to be 
above, whether they are really above or below; and thus our opinions will have 
no fixed conclusion or certainty, but will of necessity wander forth after 
worlds without limits, and gods that cannot be numbered.
5. These things, then, being so, each deity will be contented with his own 
possessions, and will not be moved with any curiosity respecting the affairs of 
others; otherwise he would be unjust, and rapacious, and would cease to be what 
God is. Each creation, too, will glorify its own maker, and will be contented 
with him, not knowing any other; otherwise it would most justly be deemed an 
apostate by all the others, and would receive a richly-deserved punishment. For 
it must be either that there is one Being who contains all things, and formed in 
His own territory all those things which have been created, according to His own 
will; or, again, that there are numerous unlimited creators and gods, who begin 
from each other, and end in each other on every side; and it will then be 
necessary to allow that all the rest are contained from without by some one who 
is greater, and that they are each of them shut up within their own territory, 
and remain in it. No one of them all, therefore, is God. For there will be 
[much] wanting to every one of them, possessing [as he will do] only a very 
small part when compared with all the rest. The name of the Omnipotent will thus 
be brought to an end, and such an opinion will of necessity fall to impiety. 


Chapter II.-The World Was Not Formed 
  by Angels, or by Any Other Being, Contrary to the Will of the Most High God, 
  But Was Made by the Father Through the Word.
  
1. Those, moreover, who say that the world was formed by angels, or by any 
other maker of it, contrary to the will of Him who is the Supreme Father, err 
first of all in this very point, that they maintain that angels formed such and 
so mighty a creation, contrary to the will of the Most High God. This would 
imply that angels were more powerful than God; or if not so, that He was either 
careless, or inferior, or paid no regard to those things which took place among 
His own possessions, whether they turned out ill or well, so that He might drive 
away and prevent the one, while He praised and rejoiced over the other. But if 
one would not ascribe such conduct even to a man of any ability, how much less 
to God
2. Next let them tell us whether these things have been formed within the 
limits which are contained by Him, and in His proper territory, or in regions 
belonging to others, and lying beyond Him? But if they say [that these things 
were done] beyond Him, then all the absurdities already mentioned will face 
them, and the Supreme God will be enclosed by that which is beyond Him, in which 
also it will be necessary that He should find His end. If, on the other hand, 
[these things were done] within His own proper territory, it will be very idle 
to say that the world was thus formed within His proper territory against His 
will by angels who are themselves under His power, or by any other being, as if 
either He Himself did not behold all things which take place among His own 
possessions, or
was not aware of the things to be done by angels.
3. If, however, [the things referred to were done] not against His will, but 
with His concurrence and knowledge, as some [of these men] think, the angels, or 
the Former of the world [whoever that may have been], will no longer be the 
causes of that formation, but the will of God. For if He is the Former of 
the world, He too made the angels, or at least was the cause of their creation; 
and He will be regarded as having made the world who prepared the causes of its 
formation. Although they maintain that the angels were made by a long succession 
downwards, or that the Former of the world [sprang] from the Supreme Father, as 
Basilides asserts; nevertheless that which is the cause of those things which 
have been made will still be traced to Him who was the Author of such a 
succession. [The case stands] just as regards success in war, which is ascribed 
to the king who prepared those things which are the cause of victory; and, in 
like manner, the creation of any state, or of any work, is referred to him who 
prepared materials for the accomplishment of those results which were afterwards 
brought about. Wherefore, we do not say that it was the axe which cut the wood, 
or the saw which divided it; but one would very properly say that the man 
cut and divided it who formed the axe and the saw for this purpose, and [who 
also formed] at a much earlier date all the tools by which the axe and the saw 
themselves were formed. With justice, therefore, according to an analogous 
process of reasoning, the Father of all will be declared the Former of this 
world, and not the angels, nor any other [so-called] former of the world, other 
than He who was its Author, and had formerly
been the cause of the preparation for a creation of this kind.
4. This manner of speech may perhaps be plausible or persuasive to those who 
know not God, and who liken Him to needy human beings, and to those who cannot 
immediately and without assistance form anything, but require many 
instrumentalities to produce what they intend. But it will not be regarded as at 
all probable by those who know that God stands in need of nothing, and that He 
created and made all things by His Word, while He neither required angels to 
assist Him in the production of those things which are made, nor of any power 
greatly inferior to Himself, and ignorant of the Father, nor of any defect or 
ignorance, in order that he who should know Him might become man.
But He Himself in Himself, after a fashion which we can neither describe nor 
conceive, predestinating all things, formed them as He pleased, bestowing 
harmony on all things, and assigning them their own place, and the beginning of 
their creation. In this way He conferred on spiritual things a spiritual and 
invisible nature, on super-celestial things a celestial, on angels an angelical, 
on animals an animal, on beings that swim a nature suited to the water, and on 
those that live on the land one fitted for the land-on all, in short, a nature 
suitable to the character of the life assigned them-while He formed all things 
that were made by His Word that never wearies.
5. For this is a peculiarity of the pre-eminence of God, not to stand in need 
of other instruments for the creation of those things which are summoned into 
existence. His own Word is both suitable and sufficient for the formation of all 
things, even as John, the disciple of the Lord, declares regarding Him: "All 
things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made."
Now, among the "all things" our world must be embraced. It too, therefore, was 
made by His Word, as Scripture tells us in the book of Genesis that He made all 
things connected with our world by His Word. David also expresses the same truth 
[when he says] "For He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were 
created."
Whom, therefore, shall we believe as to the creation of the world-these heretics 
who have been mentioned that prate so foolishly and inconsistently on the 
subject, or the disciples of the Lord, and Moses, who was both a faithful 
servant of God and a prophet? He at first narrated the formation of the world in 
these words: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,"
and all other things in succession; but neither gods nor angels [had any share 
in the work].
Now, that this God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Paul the apostle 
also has declared, [saying, ] "There is one God, the Father, who is above all, 
and through all things, and in us all."
I have indeed proved already that there is only one God; but I shall further 
demonstrate this from the apostles themselves, and from the discourses of the 
Lord. For what sort of conduct would it be, were we to forsake the utterances of 
the prophets, of the Lord, and of the apostles, that we might give heed to these 
persons, who speak not a word of sense?

Chapter III.-The Bythus and Pleroma 
  of the Valentinians, as Well as the God of Marcion, Shown to Be Absurd; The 
  World Was Actually Created by the Same Being Who Had Conceived the Idea of It, 
  and Was Not the Fruit of Defect or Ignorance.
1. The Bythus, therefore, whom they conceive of with his Pleroma, and the God 
of Marcion, are inconsistent. If indeed, as they affirm, he has something 
subjacent and beyond himself, which they style vacuity and shadow, this vacuum 
is then proved to be greater than their Pleroma. But it is inconsistent even to 
make this statement, that while he contains all things within himself, the 
creation was formed by some other. For it is absolutely necessary that they 
acknowledge a certain void and chaotic kind of existence (below the spiritual 
Pleroma) in which this universe was formed, and that the Propator purposely left 
this chaos as it was, either knowing beforehand what things were to happen in 
it, or being ignorant of them. If he was really ignorant, then God will not be 
prescient of all things. But they will not even [in that case] be able to assign 
a reason on what account He thus left this place void during so long a period of 
time. If, again, He is prescient, and contemplated mentally that creation which 
was about to have a being in that place, then He Himself created it who also 
formed it beforehand [ideally] in Himself.
2. Let them cease, therefore, to affirm that the world was made by any other; 
for as soon as God formed a conception in His mind, that was also done which He 
had thus mentally conceived. For it was not possible that one Being should 
mentally form the conception, and another actually produce the things which had 
been conceived by Him in His mind. But God, according to these heretics, 
mentally conceived either an eternal world or a temporal one, both of 
which suppositions cannot be true. Yet if He had mentally conceived of it as 
eternal, spiritual,
and visible, it would also have been formed such. But if it was formed such as 
it really is, then He made it such who had mentally conceived of it as 
such; or He willed it to exist in the ideality
of the Father, according to the conception of His mind, such as it now is, 
compound, mutable, and transient. Since, then, it is just such as the Father had 
[ideally] formed in counsel with Himself, it must be worthy of the Father. But 
to affirm that what was mentally conceived and pre-created by the Father of all, 
just as it has been actually formed, is the fruit of defect, and the production 
of ignorance, is to be guilty of great blasphemy. For, according to them, the 
Father of all will thus be [regarded as] generating in His breast, according to 
His own mental conception, the emanations of defect and the fruits of ignorance, 
since the things which He had conceived in His mind have actually been 
produced.

Chapter IV.-The Absurdity of the 
  Supposed Vacuum and Defect of the Heretics is Demonstrated.
1. The cause, then, of such a dispensation on the part of God, is to be 
inquired after; but the formation of the world is not to be ascribed to any 
other. And all things are to be spoken of as having been so prepared by God 
beforehand, that they should be made as they have been made; but shadow and 
vacuity are not to be conjured into existence. But whence, let me ask, came this 
vacuity [of which they speak]? If it was indeed produced by Him who, according 
to them, is the Father and Author of oil things, then it is both equal in honour 
and related to the rest of the Aeons, perchance even more ancient than they are. 
Moreover, if it proceeded from the same source [as they did], it must be similar 
in nature to Him who produced it, as well as to those along with whom it was 
produced. There will therefore be an absolute necessity, both that the Bythus of 
whom they speak, along with Sige, be similar in nature to a vacuum, that is, 
that He really is a vacuum; and that the rest of the Aeons, since they are the 
brothers of vacuity, should also be devoid
of substance. If, on the other hand, it has not been thus produced, it must have 
sprang from and been generated by itself, and in that case it will be equal in 
point of age to that Bythus who is, according to them, the Father of oil; and 
thus vacuity will be of the same nature and of the same honour with Him who is, 
according to them, the universal Father. For it must of necessity have been 
either produced by some one, or generated by itself, and sprung from itself. But 
if, in truth, vacuity was produced, then its producer Valentinus is also a 
vacuum, as are likewise his followers. If, again, it was not produced, but was 
generated by itself, then that which is really a vacuum is similar to, and the 
brother of, and of the same honour with, that Father who has been proclaimed by 
Valentinus; while it is more ancient, and dating its existence from a period 
greatly anterior, and more exalted in honour than the remaining Aeons of Ptolemy 
himself, and Heracleon, and all the rest 
who hold the same opinions.
2. But if, driven to despair in regard to these points, they confess that the 
Father of all contains all things, and that there is nothing whatever outside of 
the Pleroma (for it is an absolute necessity that, [if there be anything outside 
of it, ] it should be bounded and circumscribed by something greater than 
itself), and that they speak of what is without and what within in 
reference to knowledge and ignorance, and not with respect to local distance; 
but that, in the Pleroma, or in those things which are contained by the Father, 
the whole creation which we know to have been formed, having been made by the 
Demiurge, or by the angels, is contained by the unspeakable greatness, as the 
centre is in a circle, or as a spot is in a garment,-then, in the first place, 
what sort of a being must that Bythus be, who allows a stain to have place in 
His own bosom, and permits another one to create or produce within His 
territory, contrary to His own will? Such a mode of acting would truly entail 
[the charge of] degeneracy upon the entire Pleroma, since it might from the 
first have cut off that defect, and those emanations which derived their origin 
from it,
and not have agreed to permit the formation of creation either in ignorance, or 
passion, or in defect. For he who can afterwards rectify a defect, and does, as 
it were, wash away a stain,
could at a much earlier date have taken care that no such stain should, even at 
first, be found among his possessions. Or if at the first he allowed that the 
things which were made [should be as they are], since they could not, in fact, 
be formed otherwise, then it follows that they must always continue in the same 
condition. For how is it possible, that those things which cannot at the first 
obtain rectification, should subsequently receive it? Or how can men say that 
they are called to perfection, when those very beings who are the causes from 
which men derive their origin-either the Demiurge himself, or the angels-are 
declared to exist in defect? And if, as is maintained, [the Supreme Being, ] 
inasmuch as He is benignant, did at last take pity upon men, and bestow on them 
perfection, He ought at first to have pitied those who were the creators of man, 
and to have conferred on them perfection. In this way, men too would verily have 
shared in His compassion, being formed. perfect by those that were perfect. For 
if He pitied the work of these beings, He ought long before to have 
pitied themselves, and not to have allowed them to fall into such awful 
blindness.
3. Their talk also about shadow and vacuity, in which they maintain that the 
creation with which we are concerned was formed, will be brought to nothing, if 
the things referred to were created within the territory which is contained by 
the Father. For if they hold that the light of their Father is such that it 
fills all things which are inside of Him, and illuminates them all, how can any 
vacuum or shadow possibly exist within that territory which is contained by the 
Pleroma, and by the light of the Father? For, in that case, it behoves them to 
point out some place within the Propator, or within the Pleroma, which is not 
illuminated, nor kept possession of by any one, and in which either the angels 
or the Demiurge formed whatever they pleased. Nor will it be a small amount of 
space in which such and so great a creation can be conceived of as having been 
formed. There will therefore be an absolute necessity that, within the Pleroma, 
or within the Father of whom they speak, they should conceive
of some place, void, formless, and full of darkness, in which those things were 
formed which have been formed. By such a supposition, however, the light of 
their Father would incur a reproach, as if He could not illuminate and fill 
those things which are within Himself. Thus, then, when they maintain that these 
things were the fruit of defect and the work of error, they do moreover 
introduce defect and error within the Pleroma, and into the bosom of the 
Father.

Chapter V.-This World Was Not Formed 
  by Any Other Beings Within the Territory Which is Contained by the 
  Father.
1. The remarks, therefore, which I made a little while ago
are suitable in answer to those who assert that this world was formed outside of 
the Pleroma, or under a "good God; "and such persons, with the Father they speak 
of, will be quite cut off from that which is outside the Pleroma, in which, at 
the same time, it is necessary that they should finally rest.
In answer to those, again, who maintain that this world was formed by certain 
other beings within that territory which is contained by the Father, all those 
points which have now
been noticed will present themselves [as exhibiting their] absurdities and 
incoherencies; and they will be compelled either to acknowledge all those things 
which are within the Father, lucid, full, and energetic, or to accuse the light 
of the Father as if He could not illuminate all things; or, as a portion of 
their Pleroma [is so described], the whole of it must be confessed to be void, 
chaotic, and full of darkness. And they accuse all other created things as if 
these were merely temporal, or [at the best], if eternal,
yet material. But
these (the Aeons) ought to be regarded as beyond the reach of such accusations, 
since they are within the Pleroma, or the charges in question will equally fall 
against the entire Pleroma; and thus the Christ of whom they speak is discovered 
to be the author of ignorance. For, according to their statements, when He had 
given a form so far as substance was concerned to the Mother they conceive of, 
He cast her outside of the Pleroma; that is, He cut her off from knowledge. He, 
therefore, who separated her from knowledge, did in reality produce ignorance in 
her. How then could the very same person bestow the gift of knowledge on the 
rest of the Aeons, those who were anterior to Him [in production], and yet be 
the author of ignorance to His Mother? For He placed her beyond the pale of 
knowledge, when He cast her outside of the Pleroma.
2. Moreover, if they explain being within and without the Pleroma as implying 
knowledge and ignorance respectively, as certain of them do (since he who has 
knowledge is within that which knows), then they must of necessity grant that 
the Saviour Himself (whom they designate All Things) was in a state of 
ignorance. For they maintain that, on His coming forth outside of the Pleroma, 
He imparted form to their Mother [Achamoth]. If, then, they assert that whatever 
is outside [the Pleroma] is ignorant of all things, and if the Saviour went 
forth to impart form to their Mother, then He was situated beyond the pale of 
the knowledge of all things; that is, He was in ignorance. How then could He 
communicate knowledge to her, when He Himself was beyond the pale of knowledge? 
For we, too, they declare to be outside the Pleroma, inasmuch as we are outside 
of the knowledge which they possess. And once more: If the Saviour really went 
forth beyond the Pleroma to seek after the sheep which was lost, but the Pleroma 
is [co-extensive with] knowledge, then He placed Himself beyond the pale of 
knowledge, that is, in ignorance. For it is necessary either that they grant 
that what is outside the Pleroma is so in a local sense, in which case all the 
remarks formerly made will rise up against them; or if they speak of that which 
is within in regard to knowledge, and of that which is without in respect to 
ignorance, then their Saviour, and Christ long before Him, must have been formed 
in ignorance, inasmuch as they went forth beyond the Pleroma, that is, beyond 
the pale of knowledge, in order to impart form to their Mother.
3. These arguments may, in like manner, be adapted to meet the case of all 
those who, in any way, maintain that the world was formed either by angels or by 
any other one than the true God. For the charges which they bring against the 
Demiurge, and those things which were made material and temporal, will in truth 
fall back on the Father; if indeed the
very things which were formed in the bosom of the Pleroma began by and by in 
fact to be dissolved, in accordance with the permission and good-will of the 
Father. The [immediate] Creator, then, is not the [real] Author of this work, 
thinking, as He did, that He formed it very good, but Hef who allows and 
approves of the productions of defect, and the works of error having a place 
among his own possessions, and that temporal things should be mixed up with 
eternal, corruptible with incorruptible, and those which partake of error with 
those which belong to truth. If, however, these things were formed without the 
permission or approbation of the Father of all, then that Being must be more 
powerful, stronger, and more kingly, who made these things within a territory 
which properly belongs to Him (the Father), and did so without His permission. 
If again, as some say, their Father permitted these things without approving of 
them, then He gave the permission on account of some necessity, being either 
able to prevent [such procedure], or not able. But if indeed He could not 
[hinder it], then He is weak and powerless; while, if He could, He is a seducer, 
a hypocrite, and a slave of necessity, inasmuch as He does not consent [to such 
a course], and yet allows it as if He did consent. And allowing error to arise 
at the first, and to go on increasing, He endeavours in later times to destroy 
it, when already many have miserably perished on account of the [original] 
defect.
4. It is not seemly, however, to say of Him who is God over all, since He is 
free and independent, that He was a slave to necessity, or that anything takes 
place with His permission, yet against His desire; otherwise they will make 
necessity greater and more kingly than God, since that which has the most power 
is superior
to all [others]. And He ought at the very beginning to have cut off the causes 
of [the fancied] necessity, and not to have allowed Himself to be shut up to 
yielding to that necessity, by permitting anything besides that which became 
Him. For it would have been much better, more consistent, and more God-like, to 
cut off at the beginning the principle of this kind of necessity, than 
afterwards, as if moved by repentance, to endeavour to extirpate the results of 
necessity when they had reached such a development. And if the Father of all be 
a slave to necessity, and must yield to fate, while He unwillingly tolerates the 
things which are done, but is at the same time powerless to do anything in 
opposition to necessity and fate (like the Homeric Jupiter, who says of 
necessity, "I have willingly given thee, yet with unwilling mind"), then, 
according to this reasoning, the Bythus of whom they speak will be found to be 
the slave of necessity and fate.

Chapter VI.-The Angels and the 
  Creator of the World Could Not Have Been Ignorant of the Supreme 
  God.
1. How, again, could either the angels, or the Creator of the world, have 
been ignorant of the Supreme God, seeing they were His property, and His 
creatures, and were contained by Him? He might indeed have been invisible to 
them on account of His superiority, but He could by no means have been unknown 
to them on account of His providence. For though it is true, as they declare, 
that they were very far separated from Him through their inferiority [of 
nature], yet, as His dominion extended over all of them, it behoved them to know 
their Ruler, and to be aware of this in particular, that He who created them is 
Lord of all. For since His invisible essence is mighty, it confers on all a 
profound mental intuition and perception of His most powerful, yea, omnipotent 
greatness. Wherefore, although "no one knows the Father, except the Son, nor the 
Son except the Father, and those to whom the Son will reveal Him,"
yet all [beings] do know this one fact at least, because reason, implanted in 
their minds, moves them, and reveals to them [the truth] that there is one God, 
the Lord of all.
2. And on this account all things have been [by general consent] placed under 
the sway of Him who is styled the Most High, and the Almighty. By calling upon 
Him, even before the coming of our Lord, men were saved both from most wicked 
spirits, and from all kinds of demons, and from every sort of apostate power. 
This was the case, not as if earthly spirits or demons had seen Him, but because 
they knew of the existence of Him who is God over all, at whose invocation they 
trembled, as there does tremble every creature, and principality, and power, and 
every being endowed with energy under His government. By way of parallel, shall 
not those who live under the empire of the Romans, although they have never seen 
the emperor, but are far separated from him both by land and sea, know very 
well, as they experience his rule, who it is that possesses the principal power 
in the state? How then could it be, that those angels who were superior to us 
[in nature], or even He whom they call the Creator of the world, did not know 
the Almighty, when even dumb animals tremble and yield at the invocation of His 
name? And as, although they have not seen Him, yet all things are subject to the 
name of our Lord,
so must they also be to His who made and established all things by His word, 
since it was no other than He who formed the world. And for this reason do the 
Jews even now put demons to flight by means of this very adjuration, inasmuch as 
all beings fear the invocation of Him who created them.
3. If, then, they shrink from affirming that the angels are more irrational 
than the dumb animals, they will find that it behoved these, although they had 
not seen Him who is God over all, to know His power and sovereignty. For it will 
appear truly ridiculous, if they maintain that they themselves indeed, who dwell 
upon the earth, know Him who is God over all whom they have never seen, but will 
not allow Him who, according to their opinion, formed them and the whole world, 
although He dwells in the heights and above the heavens, to know those things 
with which they themselves, though they dwell below, are acquainted. [This is 
the case], unless perchance they maintain that Bythus lives in Tartarus below 
the earth, and that on this account they have attained to a knowledge of Him 
before those angels who have their abode on high. Thus do they rush into such an 
abyss of madness as to pronounce the Creator of the world void of understanding. 
They are truly deserving of pity, since with such utter folly they affirm that 
He (the Creator of the world) neither knew His Mother, nor her seed, nor the 
Pleroma of the Aeons, nor the Propator, nor what the things were which He made; 
but that these are images of those things which are within the Pleroma, the 
Saviour having secretly laboured that they should be so formed [`by the 
unconscious Demiurge], in honour of those things which are above.

Chapter VII.-Created Things are Not 
  the Images of Those Aeons Who are Within the Pleroma.
1. While the Demiurge was thus ignorant of all things, they tell us that the 
Saviour conferred honour upon the Pleroma by the creation [which he summoned 
into existence] through means of his Mother, inasmuch as he produced similitudes 
and images of those things which are above. But I have already shown that it was 
impossible that anything should exist beyond the Pleroma (in which 
external region they tell us that images were made of those things which are 
within the Pleroma), or that this world was formed by any other one than the 
Supreme God. But if it is a pleasant thing to overthrow them on every side, and 
to prove them vendors of falsehood; let us say, in opposition to them, that if 
these things were made by the Saviour to the honour of those which are above, 
after their likeness, then it behoved them always to endure, that those things 
which have been honoured should perpetually continue in honour. But if they do 
in fact pass away, what is the use of this very brief period of honour,-an 
honour which at one time had no existence, and which shall again come to 
nothing? In that case I shall prove that the Saviour is rather an aspirant after 
vainglory, than
one who honours those things which are above, For what honour can those things 
which are temporal confer on such as are eternal and endure for ever? or those 
which pass away on such as remain? or those which are corruptible on such as are 
incorruptible?-since, even among men who are themselves mortal, there is no 
value attached to that honour which speedily passes away, but to that which 
endures as long as it possibly can. But those things which, as soon as they are 
made, come to an end, may justly be said rather to have been formed for the 
contempt of such as are thought to be honoured by them; and that that which is 
eternal is contumeliously treated when its image is corrupted and dissolved. But 
what if their Mother had not wept, and laughed, and been involved in despair? 
The Saviour would not then have possessed any means of honouring the Fulness, 
inasmuch as her last state of confusion 
did not have substance of its own by which it might honour the Propator.
2. Alas for the honour of vainglory which at once passes away, and no longer 
appears! There will be some
Aeon, in whose case such honour will not be thought at all to have had an 
existence, and then the things which are above will be unhonoured; or it will be 
necessary to produce once more another Mother weeping, and in despair, in order 
to the honour of the Pleroma. What a dissimilar, and at the same time 
blasphemous image! Do you tell me that an image of the Only-begotten was 
produced by the former
of the world, whom
again ye wish to be considered the Nous (mind) of the Father of all, and [yet 
maintain] that this image was ignorant of itself, ignorant of 
creation,-ignorant, too, of the Mother,-ignorant of everything that exists, and 
of those things which were made by it; and are you not ashamed while, in 
opposition to yourselves, you ascribe ignorance even to the Only-begotten 
Himself? For if these things [below] were made by the Saviour after the 
similitude of those which are above, while He (the Demiurge) who was made after 
such similitude was in so great ignorance, it necessarily follows that around 
Him, and in accordance with Him, after whose likeness be that is thus ignorant 
was formed, ignorance of the kind in question spiritually exists. For it is not 
possible, since both were produced spiritually, and neither fashioned nor 
composed, that in some the likeness was preserved, while in others the likeness 
of the image was spoiled, that image which was here produced that it might be 
according to the image of that production which is above. But if it is not 
similar, the charge will then attach to the Saviour, who produced a dissimilar 
image,-of being, so to speak, an incompetent workman. For it is out of their 
power to affirm that the Saviour had not the faculty of production, since they 
style Him All Things. If, then, the image is dissimilar, he is a poor 
workman, and the blame lies, according to their hypothesis, with the Saviour. 
If, on the other hand, it is similar, then the same ignorance will be found to 
exist in the Nous (mind) of their Propator, that is, in the Only-begotten. The 
Nous of the Father, in that case, was ignorant of Himself; ignorant, too, of the 
Father; ignorant, moreover, of those very things which were formed by Him. But 
if He has knowledge, it necessarily follows also that he who was formed 
after his likeness by the Saviour should know the things which are like; and 
thus, according to their own principles, their monstrous blasphemy is 
overthrown.
3. Apart from this, however, how can those things which belong to creation, 
various, manifold, and innumerable as they are, be the images of those thirty 
Aeons which are within the Pleroma, whose names, as these men fix them, I have 
set forth in the book which precedes this? And not only will they be unable to 
adapt the [vast] variety of creation at large to the [comparative] smallness of 
their Pleroma, but they cannot do this even with respect to any one part of it, 
whether [that possessed by] celestial or terrestrial beings, or those that live 
in the waters. For they themselves testify that their Pleroma consists of thirty 
Aeons; but any one will undertake to show that, in a single department of those 
[created beings] which have been mentioned, they reckon that there are not 
thirty, but many thousands of species. How then can those things, which 
constitute such a multiform creation, which are opposed in nature to each other, 
and disagree among themselves, and destroy the one the other, be the images and 
likenesses of the thirty Aeons of the Pleroma, if indeed, as they declare, these 
being possessed of one nature, are of equal and similar properties, and exhibit 
no differences [among themselves]? For it was incumbent, if these things are 
images of those Aeons,-inasmuch as they declare that some men are wicked by 
nature, and some, on the other hand, naturally good,-to point out such 
differences also among their Aeons, and to maintain that some of them were 
produced naturally good, while some were naturally evil, so that the supposition 
of the likeness of those things might harmonize with the Aeons. Moreover, since 
there are in the world some creatures that are gentle, and others that are 
fierce, some that are innocuous, while others are hurtful and destroy the rest; 
some have their abode on the earth, others in the water, others in the air, and 
others in the heaven; in like manner, they are bound to show that the Aeons 
possess such properties, if indeed the one are the images of the others. And 
besides; "the eternal fire which the Father has prepared for the devil and his 
angels,"
-they ought to show of which of those Aeons that are above it is the image; for 
it, too, is reckoned part of the creation.
4. If, however, they say that these things are the images of the Enthymesis 
of that Aeon who fell into passion, then, first of all, they will act impiously 
against their Mother, by declaring her to be the first cause of evil and 
corruptible images. And then, again, how can those things which are manifold, 
and dissimilar, and contrary in their nature, be the images of one and the same 
Being? And if they say that the angels of the Pleroma are numerous, and that 
those things which are many are the images of these-not in this way either will 
the account they give be satisfactory. For, in the first place, they are then 
bound to point out differences among the angels of the Pleroma, which are 
mutually opposed to each other, even as the images existing below are of a 
contrary nature among themselves. And then, again, since there are many, yea, 
innumerable angels who surround the Creator, as all the prophets 
acknowledge,-[saying, for instance, ] "Ten thousand times ten thousand stood 
beside Him, and many thousands of thousands ministered unto Him,"
-then, according
to them, the angels of the Pleroma will have as images the angels of the 
Creator, and the entire creation remains in the image of the Pleroma, but so 
that the thirty Aeons no longer correspond to the manifold variety of the 
creation.
5. Still further, if these things [below] were made after the similitude of 
those [above], after the likeness of which again will those then be made? For if 
the Creator of the world did not form these things directly from His own
conception, but, like an architect of no ability, or a boy receiving his first 
lesson, copied them from archetypes furnished by others, then whence did their 
Bythus obtain the forms of that creation which He at first produced? It clearly 
follows that He must have received the model from some other one who is above 
Him, and that one, in turn, from another. And none the less [for these 
suppositions], the talk about images, as about gods, will extend to infinity, if 
we do not at once fix our mind on one Artificer, and on one God, who of Himself 
formed those things which have been created. Or is it really the case that, in 
regard to mere men, one will allow that they have of themselves invented what is 
useful for the purposes of life, but will not grant to that God who formed the 
world, that of Himself He created the forms of those things which have been 
made, and imparted to it its orderly arrangement?
6. But, again, how can these things [below] be images of those [above], since 
they are really contrary to them, and can in no respect have sympathy with them? 
For those things which are contrary to each other may indeed be destructive of 
those to which they are contrary, but can by no means be their images-as, for 
instance, water and fire; or, again, light and darkness, and other such things, 
can never be the images of one another. In like manner, neither can those things 
which are corruptible and earthly, and of a compound nature, and transitory, be 
the images of those which, according to these men, are spiritual; unless these 
very things themselves be allowed to be compound, limited in space, and of a 
definite shape, and thus no longer spiritual, and diffused, and spreading into 
vast extent, and incomprehensible. For they must of necessity be possessed of a 
definite figure, and confined within certain limits, that they may be true 
images; and then it is decided that they are not spiritual. If, however, these 
men maintain that they are spiritual, and diffused, and incomprehensible, how 
can those things which are possessed of figure, and confined within certain 
limits, be the images of such as are destitute of figure and 
incomprehensible?
7. If, again, they affirm that neither according to configuration nor 
formation, but according to number and the order of production, those things 
[above] are the images [of these below], then, in the first place, these things 
[below] ought not to be spoken of as images and likenesses of those Aeons that 
are above. For how can the things which have neither the fashion nor shape of 
those [above] be their images? And, in the next place, they would adapt both the 
numbers and productions of the Aeons above, so as to render them identical with 
and similar to thoseth at belong to the creation [below]. But now, since they 
refer to only thirty Aeons, and declare that the vast multitude of things which 
are embraced within the creation [below] are images of those that are but 
thirty, we may justly condemn them as utterly destitute of sense.

Chapter VIII.-Created Things are Not 
  a Shadow of the Pleroma.
1. If, again, they declare that these things [below] are a shadow of those 
[above], as some of them are bold enough to maintain, so that in this respect 
they are images, then it will be necessary for them to allow that those things 
which are above are possessed of bodies. For those bodies which are above do 
cast a shadow, but spiritual substances do not, since they can in no degree 
darken others. If, however, we also grant them this point (though it is, in 
fact, an impossibility), that there is a shadow belonging to those essences 
which are spiritual and lucent, into which they declare their Mother descended; 
yet, since those things [which are above] are eternal, and that shadow which is 
cast by them endures for ever, [it follows that] these things [below] are also 
not transitory, but endure along with those which cast their shadow over them. 
If, on the other hand, these things [below] are transitory, it is a necessary 
consequence that those [above] also, of which these are the shadow, pass away; 
while; if they endure, their shadow likewise endures.
2. If, however, they maintain that the shadow spoken of does not exist as 
being produced by the shade of [those above], but simply in this respect, that 
[the things below] are far separated from those [above], they will then charge 
the light of their Father with weakness and insufficiency, as if it cannot 
extend so far as these things, but fails to fill that which is empty, and to 
dispel the shadow, and that when no one is offering any hindrance. For, 
according to them, the light of their Father will be changed into darkness and 
buried in obscurity, and will come to an end in those places which are 
characterized by emptiness, since it cannot penetrate and fill all things. Let 
them then no longer declare that their Bythus is the fulness of all things, if 
indeed he has neither filled nor illuminated that which is vacuum and shadow; 
or, on the other hand, let them cease talking of vacuum and shadow, if the light 
of their Father does in truth fill all things.
3. Beyond the primary Father, then-that is, the God who is over all-there can 
neither be any Pleroma into which they declare the Enthymesis of that Aeon who 
suffered passion, descended (so that the Pleroma itself, or the primary God, 
should not be limited and circumscribed by that which is beyond, and should, in 
fact, be contained by it); nor can vacuum or shadow have any existence, since 
the Father exists beforehand, so that His light cannot fail, and find end in a 
vacuum. It is, moreover, irrational and impious to conceive of a place in which 
He who is, according to them, Propator, and Proarche, and Father of all, and of 
this Pleroma, ceases and has an end. Nor, again, is it allowable, for the 
reasons
already stated, to allege that some other being formed so vast a creation in the 
bosom of the Father, either with or without His consent. For it is equally 
impious and infatuated to affirm that so great a creation was
formed by angels, or by some particular production ignorant of the true God in 
that territory which is His own. Nor is it possible that those things which are 
earthly and material could have been formed within their Pleroma, since that is 
wholly spiritual. And further, it is not even possible that those things which 
belong to a multiform creation, and have been formed with mutually opposite 
qualities [could have been created] after the image of the things above, since 
these (i.e., the Aeons) are said to be few, and of a like formation, and 
homogeneous. Their talk, too, about the shadow of kenoma-that is, of a vacuum-has in all points turned 
out false. Their figment, then, [in what way soever viewed, ] has been proved 
groundless,
and their doctrines untenable. Empty, too, are those who listen to them, and are 
verily descending into the abyss of perdition.

Chapter IX.-There is But One Creator 
  of the World, God the Father: This the Constant Belief of the 
  Church.
1. That God is the Creator of the world is accepted even by those very 
persons who in many ways speak against Him, and yet acknowledge Him, styling Him 
the Creator, and an angel, not to mention that all the Scriptures call out [to 
the same effect], and the Lord teaches us of this Father
who is in heaven, and no other, as I shall show in the sequel of this work. For 
the present, however, that proof which is derived from those who allege 
doctrines opposite to ours, is of itself sufficient,-all men, in fact, 
consenting to this truth: the ancients on their part preserving with special 
care, from the tradition of the first-formed man, this persuasion, while they 
celebrate the praises of one God, the Maker of heaven and earth; others, again, 
after them, being reminded of this fact by the prophets of God, while the very 
heathen learned it from creation itself. For even creation reveals Him who 
formed it, and the very work made suggests Him who made it, and the world 
manifests Him who ordered it. The Universal Church, moreover, through the whole 
world, has received this tradition from the apostles.
2. This God, then, being acknowledged, as I have said, and receiving 
testimony from all to the fact of His existence, that Father whom they conjure 
into existence is beyond doubt untenable, and has no witnesses [to his 
existence]. Simon Magus was the first who said that he himself was God over all, 
and that the world was formed by his angels. Then those who succeeded him, as I 
have shown in the first book,
by their several opinions, still further depraved [his teaching] through their 
impious and irreligious doctrines against the Creator. These [heretics now 
referred to],
being the disciples of those mentioned, render such as assent to them worse than 
the heathen. For the former "serve the creature rather than the Creator,"
and "those which are not gods,"
notwithstanding that they ascribe the first place in Deity to that God who was 
the Maker of this universe. But the latter maintain that He, [i.e., the Creator 
of this world, ] is the fruit of a defect, and describe Him as being of an 
animal nature, and as not knowing that Power which is above Him, while He also 
exclaims, "I am God, and besides Me there is no other God."
Affirming that He lies, they are themselves liars, attributing all sorts of 
wickedness to Him; and conceiving of one who is not above this Being as really 
having an existence, they are thus convicted by their own views of blasphemy 
against that God who really exists, while they conjure into existence a god who 
has no existence, to their own condemnation. And thus those who declare 
themselves "perfect," and as being possessed of the knowledge of all things, are 
found to be worse than the heathen, and to entertain more blasphemous opinions 
even against their own Creator.

Chapter X.-Perverse Interpretations 
  of Scripture by the Heretics: God Created All Things Out of Nothing, and Not 
  from Pre-Existent Matter.
1. It is therefore in the highest degree irrational, that we should take no 
account of Him who is truly God, and who receives testimony from all, while we 
inquire whether there is above Him that [other being] who really has no 
existence, and has never been proclaimed by any one.For that nothing has been 
clearly spoken regarding Him, they themselves furnish testimony; for since they, 
with wretched success, transfer to that being who has been conceived of by them, 
those parables [of Scripture] which, whatever the form in which they have been 
spoken, are sought after [for this purpose], it is manifest that they now 
generate another [god], who was never previously sought after. For by the fact 
that they thus endeavour to explain ambiguous passages of Scripture (ambiguous, 
however, not as if referring to another god, but as regards the dispensations of 
[the true] God), they have constructed another god, weaving, as I said before, 
ropes of sand, and affixing a more important to a less important question. For 
no question can be solved by means of another which itself awaits solution; nor, 
in the opinion of those possessed of sense, can an ambiguity be explained by 
means of another ambiguity, or enigmas by means of another greater enigma, but 
things of such character receive their solution from those which are manifest, 
and consistent and clear.
2. But these [heretics], while striving to explain passages of Scripture and 
parables, bring forward another more important, and indeed impious question, to 
this effect, "Whether there be really another god above that God who was the 
Creator of the world? "They are not in the way of solving the questions [which 
they propose]; for how could they find means of doing so? But they append an 
important question to one of less consequence, and thus insert [in their 
speculations] a difficulty incapable of solution. For in order that they 
may know "knowledge" itself (yet not learning this fact, that the Lord, when thirty 
years old, came to the baptism of truth), they do impiously despise that God who 
was the Creator, and who sent Him for the salvation of men. And that they may be 
deemed capable of informing us whence is the substance of matter, while they 
believe not that God, according to His pleasure, in the exercise of His own will 
and power, formed all things (so that those things which now are should have an 
existence) out of what did not previously exist, they have collected [a 
multitude of] vain discourses. They thus truly reveal their infidelity; they do 
not believe in that which really exists, and they have fallen away into [the 
belief of] that which has, in fact, no existence.
3. For, when they tell us that all moist substance proceeded from the tears 
of Achamoth, all lucid substance from her smile, all solid substance from her 
sadness, all mobile substance from her terror, and that thus they have sublime 
knowledge on account of which they are superior to others,-how can these things 
fail to be regarded as worthy of contempt, and truly ridiculous? They do not 
believe that God (being powerful, and rich in all resources) created matter 
itself, inasmuch as they know not how much a spiritual and divine essence can 
accomplish. But they do believe that their Mother, whom they style a female from 
a female, produced from her passions aforesaid the so vast material substance of 
creation. They inquire, too, whence the substance of creation was supplied to 
the Creator; but they do not inquire whence [were supplied] to their Mother 
(whom they call the Enthymesis and impulse of the Aeon that went astray) so 
great an amount of tears, or perspiration, or sadness, or that which produced 
the remainder of matter.
4. For, to attribute the substance of created things to the power and will of 
Him who is God of all, is worthy both of credit and acceptance. It is also 
agreeable [to reason], and there may be well said regarding such a belief, that 
"the things which are impossible with men are possible with God."
While men, indeed, cannot make anything out of nothing, but only out of matter 
already existing, yet God is in this point proeminently superior to men, that He 
Himself called into being the substance of His creation, when previously it had 
no existence. But the assertion that matter was produced from the Enthymesis of 
an Aeon going astray, and that the Aeon [referred to] was far separated from her 
Enthymesis, and that, again, her passion and feeling, apart from herself, became 
matter-is incredible, infatuated, impossible, and untenable.

Chapter XI.-The Heretics, from Their 
  Disbelief of the Truth, Have Fallen into an Abyss of Error: Reasons for 
  Investigating Their Systems.
1. They do not believe that He, who is God above all, formed by His Word, in 
His own territory, as He Himself pleased, the various and diversified [works of 
creation which exist], inasmuch as He is the former of all things, like a wise 
architect, and a most powerful monarch. But they believe that angels, or some 
power separate from God, and who was ignorant of Him, formed this universe. By 
this course, therefore, not yielding credit to the truth, but wallowing in 
falsehood, they have lost the bread of true life, and have fallen into 
vacuity and an abyss of shadow. They are like the dog of Aesop, which dropped the bread, 
and made an attempt at seizing its Shadow, thus losing the [real] food. It is 
easy to prove from the very words of the Lord, that He acknowledges one Father 
and Creator of the world, and Fashioner of man, who was proclaimed by the law 
and the prophets, while He knows no other, and that this One is really God over 
all; and that He teaches that that adoption of sons pertaining to the Father, 
which is eternal life, takes place through Himself, conferring it [as He does] 
on all the righteous. 
2. But since these men delight in attacking us, and in their true character 
of cavillers assail us with points which really tell not at all against us, 
bringing forward in opposition to us a multitude of parables and [captious] 
questions, I have thought it well, on the other side, first of all to put to 
them the following inquiries concerning their own doctrines, to exhibit their 
improbability, and to put an end to their audacity. After this has been done, [I 
intend] to bring forward the discourses of the Lord, so that they may not only 
be rendered destitute of the means of attacking us, but that, since they will be 
unable reasonably to reply to those questions which are put, they may see that 
their plan of argument is destroyed; so that, either returning to the truth, and 
humbling themselves, and ceasing from their multifarious phantasies, they may 
propitiate God for those. blasphemies they have uttered against Him, and obtain 
salvation; or that, if they still persevere in that system of vainglory which 
has taken possession of their minds, they may at least find it necessary to 
change their kind of argument against us.

Chapter XII.-The Triacontad of the 
  Heretics Errs Both by Defect and Excess: Sophia Could Never Have Produced 
  Anything Apart from Her Consort; Logos and Sige Could Not Have Been 
  Contemporaries.
1. We may remark, in the first place, regarding their Triacontad, that the whole of it 
marvellously falls to ruin on both sides, that is, both as respects defect and 
excess. They say that to indicate it the Lord came to be baptized at the age of 
thirty years. But this assertion really amounts to a manifest subversion of 
their entire argument. As to defect, this happens as follows: first of all, 
because they reckon the Propator among the other Aeons. For the Father of all 
ought not to be counted with other productions; He who was not produced with 
that which was produced; He who was unbegotten with that which was born; He whom 
no one comprehends with that which is comprehended by Him, and who is on this 
account [Himself] incomprehensible; and He who is without figure with that which 
has a definite shape. For inasmuch as He is superior to the rest, He ought not 
to be numbered with them, and that so that He who is impassible and not in error 
should be reckoned with an Aeon subject to passion, and actually in error. For I 
have shown in the book which immediately precedes this, that, beginning with 
Bythus, they reckon up the Tricontad to Sophia, whom they describe as the erring 
Aeon; and I have also there set forth the names of their [Aeons]; but if He be 
not reckoned, there are no longer, on their own showing, thirty productions of 
Aeons, but these then become only twenty-nine.
2. Next, with respect to the first production Ennoea, whom they also term 
Sige, from whom again they describe Nous and Aletheia as having been sent forth, 
they err in both particulars. For it is impossible that the thought (Ennoea) of 
any one, or his silence (Sige), should be understood apart from himself; and 
that, being sent forth beyond him, it should possess a special figure of its 
own. But if they assert that the (Ennoea) was not sent forth beyond Him, but 
continued one with the Propator, why then do they reckon her with the other 
Aeons-with those who were not one [with the Father], and are on this account 
ignorant of His greatness? If, however, she was so united (let us take this also 
into consideration), there is then an absolute necessity, that from this united 
and inseparable conjunction, which constitutes but one being, there
should proceed an unseparated and united production, so that it should not be 
dissimilar to Him who sent it forth. But if this be so, then just as Bythus and 
Sige, so also Nous and Aletheia will form one and the same being, ever cleaving 
mutually together. And inasmuch as the one cannot be conceived of without the 
other, just as water cannot [be conceived of] without [the thought of] moisture, 
or fire without [the thought of] heat, or a stone without [the thought] of 
hardness (for these things are mutually bound together, and the one cannot be 
separated from the other, but always co-exists with it), so it behoves Bythus to 
be united in the same way with Ennoea, and Nous with Aletheia. Logos and Zoe 
again, as being sent forth by those that are thus united, ought themselves to be 
united, and to constitute only one being. But, according to such a process of 
reasoning, Homo and Ecclesia too, and indeed all the remaining conjunctions of 
the Aeons produced, ought to be united, and always to coexist, the one with the 
other. For there is a necessity in their opinion, that a female Aeon should 
exist side by side with a male one, inasmuch as she is, so to speak, [the 
forthputting of] his affection.
3. These things being so, and such opinions being proclaimed by them, they 
again venture, without a blush, to teach that the younger Aeon of the Duodecad, 
whom they also style Sophia, did, apart from union with her consort, whom they 
call Theletus, endure passion, and separately, without any assistance from him, 
gave birth to a production which they name "a female from a female." They thus 
rush into such utter frenzy, as to form two most clearly opposite opinions 
respecting the same point. For if Bythus is ever one with Sige, Nous with 
Aletheia, Logos with Zoe, and so on, as respects the rest, how could Sophia, 
without union with her consort, either suffer or generate anything? And if, 
again, she did really. suffer passion apart from him, it necessarily follows 
that the other conjunctions also admit of disjunction and separation among 
themselves,-a thing which I have already shown to be impossible. It is also 
impossible, therefore, that Sophia suffered passion apart from Theletus; and 
thus, again, their whole system of argument is overthrown. For they have 
yet again derived the whole of remaining [material substance], like the composition 
of a tragedy, from that passion which they affirm she experienced apart from 
union with her consort.
4. If, however, they impudently maintain, in order to preserve from ruin 
their vain imaginations, that the rest of the conjunctions also were disjoined 
and separated from one another on account of this latest conjunction, then [I 
reply that], in the first place, they rest upon a thing which is impossible. For 
how can they separate the Propator from his Ennoea, or Nous from Aletheia, or 
Logos from Zoe, and so on with the rest? And how can they themselves maintain 
that they tend again to unity, and are, in fact, all at one, if indeed these 
very conjunctions, which are within the Pleroma, do not preserve unity, but are 
separate from one another; and that to such a degree, that they both endure 
passion and perform the work of generation without union one with another, just 
as hens do apart from intercourse with cocks.
5. Then, again, their first and first-begotten Ogdoad will be overthrown as 
follows: They must admit that Bythus and Sige, Nous and Aletheia, Logos and Zoe, 
Anthropos and Ecclesia, do individually dwell in the same Pleroma. But it is 
impossible that Sige (silence) can exist in the presence of Logos (speech), or 
again, that Logos can manifest himself in the presence of Sige. For these are 
mutually destructive of each other, even as light and darkness can by no 
possibility exist in the same place: for if light prevails, there cannot be 
darkness; and if darkness, there cannot be light, since, where light appears, 
darkness is put to flight. In like manner, where Sige is, there cannot be Logos; 
and where Logos is, there certainly cannot be Sige. But if they say that Logos 
simply exists within
(unexpressed), Sige also will exist within, and will not the less be destroyed 
by the Logos within. But that he really is not merely conceived of in the mind, 
the very order of the production of their (Aeons) shows.
6. Let them not then declare that the first and principal Ogdoad consists of 
Logos and Sige, but let them [as a matter of necessity] exclude either Sige or 
Logos; and then their first and principal Ogdoad is at an end. For if they 
describe the conjunctions [of the Aeons] as united, then their whole argument 
fails to pieces. Since, if they were united, how could Sophia have generated a 
defect without union with her consort? If, on the other hand, they maintain 
that, as in production, each of the Aeons possesses his own peculiar substance, 
then how can Sige and Logos manifest themselves in the same place? So far, then, 
with respect to defect.
7. But again, their Triacontad is overthrown as to excess by the following 
considerations. They represent Horos (whom they call by a variety of names which 
I have mentioned in the preceding book) as having been produced by Monogenes 
just like the other Aeons. Some of them maintain that this Horos was produced by 
Monogenes, while others affirm that he was sent forth by the Propator himself in 
His own image. They affirm further, that a production was formed by 
Monogenes-Christ and the Holy Spirit; and they do not reckon these in the number 
of the Pleroma, nor the Saviour either, whom they also declare to be <i>totum
(all things). Now, it is evident even to a blind man, that not merely thirty 
productions, as they maintain, were sent forth, but four more along with these 
thirty. For they reckon the Propator himself in the Pleroma, and those too, who 
in succession were produced by one another. Why is it, then, that those [other 
beings] are not reckoned as existing with these in the same Pleroma, since they 
were produced in the same manner? For what just reason can they assign for not 
reckoning along with the other Aeons, either Christ, whom they describe as 
having, according to the Father's will, been produced by Monogenes, or the Holy 
Spirit, or Horos, whom they also call Soter 
(Saviour), and not even the Saviour Himself, who came to impart assistance and 
form to their Mother? Whether is this as if these latter were weaker than the 
former, and therefore unworthy of the name of Aeons, or of being numbered among 
them, or as if they were superior and more excellent? But how could they be 
weaker, since they were produced for the establishment and rectification of the 
others? And then, again, they cannot possibly be superior to the first and 
principal Tetrad, by which they were also produced; for it, too, is reckoned in 
the number above mentioned. These latter beings, then, ought also to have been 
numbered in the Pleroma of the Aeons, or that should be deprived of the honour 
of those Aeons which bear this appellation (the Tetrad).
8. Since, therefore, their Triacontad is thus brought to nought, as I have 
shown, both with respect to defect and excess (for in dealing with such a 
number, either excess or defect [to any extent] will render the number 
untenable, and how much more so great variations? ), it follows that what they 
maintain respecting their Ogdoad and Duodecad is a mere fable which cannot 
stand. Their whole system, moreover, falls to the ground, when their very 
foundation is destroyed and dissolved into Bythus,
that is, into what has no existence. Let them, then, henceforth seek to set 
forth some other reasons why the Lord came to be baptized at the age of thirty 
years, and [explain in some other way] the Duodecad of the apostles; and [the 
fact stated regarding] her who suffered from an issue of blood; and all the 
other points respecting which they so madly labour in vain.

Chapter XIII.-The First Order of 
  Production Maintained by the Heretics is Altogether 
Indefensible.
1. I now proceed to show, as follows, that the first order of production, as 
conceived of by them, must be rejected. For they maintain that Nous and Aletheia 
were produced from Bythus and his Ennoea, which is proved to be a contradiction. 
For Nous is that which is itself chief, and highest, and, as it were, the 
principle and source of all understanding. Ennoea, again, which arises from him, 
is any sort of emotion concerning any subject. It cannot be, therefore, that 
Nous was produced by Bythus and Ennoea; it would be more like the truth for them 
to maintain that Ennoea was produced as the daughter of the Propator and this 
Nous. For Ennoea not the daughter of Nous, as they assert, but Nous becomes the 
father of Ennoea. For how can Nous have been produced by the Propator, when he 
holds the chief and primary place of that hidden and invisible affection which 
is within Him? By this affection sense is produced, and Ennoea, and Enthymesis, 
and other things which are simply synonyms for Nous himself. As I have said 
already, they are merely certain definite exercises in thought of that very 
power concerning some particular subject. We understand the [several] terms 
according to their
length and breadth of meaning, not according to any [fundamental] change [of 
signification]; and the [various exercises of thought] are limited by [the same 
sphere of] knowledge, and are expressed together by [the same] term, the [very 
same] sense remaining within, and creating, and administering, and freely 
governing even by its own power, and as it pleases, the things which have been 
previously mentioned.
2. For the first exercise of that [power] respecting anything, is styled 
Ennoea; but when it continues, and gathers strength, and takes possession of the 
whole soul, it is called Enthymesis. This Enthymesis, again, when it exercises 
itself a long time on the same point, and has, as it were, been proved, is named 
Sensation. And this Sensation, when it is much developed, becomes Counsel. The 
increase, again, and greatly developed exercise of this Counsel becomes the 
Examination of thought (Judgment); and this remaining in the mind is most 
properly termed Logos (reason), from which the spoken Logos (word) 
proceeds. 
But all the [exercises of thought] which have been mentioned are [fundamentally] 
one and the same, receiving their origin from Nous, and obtaining [different] 
appellation according to their increase. Just as the human body, which is at one 
time young, then in the prime of life, and then old, has received [different] 
appellations according to its increase and continuance, but not according to any 
change of substance, or on account of any [real] loss of body, so is it with 
those [mental exercises]. For, when one [mentally] contemplates anything, he 
also thinks of it; and when he thinks of it, he has also knowledge regarding it; 
and when he knows it, he also considers it; and when he considers it, he also 
mentally handles it; and when he mentally handles it, he also speaks of it. But, 
as I have already said, it is Nous who governs all these [mental processes], 
while He is himself invisible, and utters speech of himself by means of those 
processes which have been mentioned, as it were by rays [proceeding from Him], 
but He himself is not sent forth by any other.
3. These things may properly be said to hold good in men, since they are 
compound by nature, and consist of a body and a soul. But those who affirm that 
Ennoea was sent forth from God, and Nous from Ennoea, and then, in succession, 
Logos from these, are, in the first place, to be blamed as having improperly 
used these productions; and, in the next place, as describing the affections, 
and passions, and mental tendencies of men, while they [thus prove themselves] 
ignorant of God. By their manner of speaking, they ascribe those things which 
apply to men to the Father of all, whom they also declare to be unknown to all; 
and they deny that He himself made the world, to guard against attributing want 
of power
to Him; while, at the same time, they endow Him with human affections and 
passions. But if they had known the Scriptures, and been taught by the truth, 
they would have known, beyond doubt, that God is not as men are; and that His 
thoughts are not like the thoughts of men.
For the Father of all is at a vast distance from those affections and passions 
which operate among men. He is a simple, uncompounded Being, without diverse 
members,
and altogether like, and equal to himself, since He is wholly understanding, and 
wholly spirit, and wholly thought, and wholly intelligence, and wholly reason, 
and wholly hearing, and wholly seeing, and wholly light, and the whole source of 
all that is good-even as the religious and pious are wont to speak concerning 
God.
4. He is, however, above [all] these properties, and therefore indescribable. 
For He may well and properly be called an Understanding which comprehends all 
things, but He is not [on that account] like the understanding of men; and He 
may most properly be termed Light, but He is nothing like that light with which 
we are acquainted. And so, in all other particulars, the Father of all is in no 
degree similar to human weakness. He is spoken of in these terms according to 
the love [we bear Him]; but in point of greatness, our thoughts regarding Him 
transcend these expressions. If then, even in the case of human beings, 
understanding itself does not arise from emission, nor is that intelligence 
which produces other things separated from the living man, while its motions and 
affections come into manifestation, much more will the mind of God, who is all 
understanding, never by any means be separated from Himself; nor can 
anything
[in His case] be produced as if by a different Being.
5. For if He produced intelligence, then He who did thus produce intelligence 
must be understood, in accordance with their views, as a compound and corporeal 
Being; so that God, who sent forth [the intelligence referred to], is separate 
from it, and the intelligence which was sent forth separate [from Him]. But if 
they affirm that intelligence was sent forth from intelligence, they then cut 
asunder the intelligence of God, and divide it into parts. And whither has it 
gone? Whence was it sent forth? For whatever is sent forth from any place, 
passes of necessity into some other. But what existence was there more ancient 
than the intelligence of God, into which they maintain it was sent forth? And 
what a vast region that must have been which was capable of receiving and 
containing the intelligence of God! If, however, they affirm [that this emission 
took place] just as a ray proceeds from the sun, then, as the subjacent air 
which receives the ray must have had an existence prior to it, so [by such 
reasoning] they will indicate that there was something in existence, into which 
the intelligence of God was sent forth, capable of containing it, and more 
ancient than itself. Following upon this, we must hold that, as we see the sun, 
which is less than all things, sending forth rays from himself to a great 
distance, so likewise we say that the Propator sent forth a ray beyond, and to a 
great distance from, Himself. But what can be conceived of beyond, or at a 
distance from, God, into which He sent forth this ray?
6. If, again, they affirm that that [intelligence] was not sent forth beyond 
the Father, but within the Father Himself, then, in the first place, it becomes 
superfluous to say that it was sent forth at all. For how could it have been 
sent forth if it continued within the Father? For an emission is the 
manifestation of that which is emitted, beyond him who emits it. In the next 
place, this [intelligence] being sent forth, both that Logos who springs from 
Him will still be within the Father, as will also be the future emissions 
proceeding from Logos. These, then, cannot in such a case be ignorant of the 
Father, since they are within Him; nor, being all equally surrounded by the 
Father, can any one know Him less [than another] according to the descending 
order of their emission. And all of them must also in an equal measure continue 
impassible, since they exist in the bosom of their Father, and none of them can 
ever sink into a state of degeneracy or degradation. For with the Father there 
is no degeneracy, unless perchance as in a great circle a smaller is contained, 
and within this one again a smaller; or unless they affirm of the Father, that, 
after the manner of a sphere or a square, He contains within Himself on all 
sides the likeness of a sphere, or the production of the rest of the Aeons in 
the form of a square, each one of these being surrounded by that one who is 
above him in greatness, and surrounding in turn that one who is after him in 
smallness; and that on this account, the smallest and the last of all, having 
its place in the centre, and thus being far separated from the Father, was 
really ignorant of the Propator. But if they maintain any such hypothesis, they 
must shut up their Bythus with. in a definite form and space, while He both 
surrounds others, and is surrounded by them; for they must of necessity 
acknowledge that there is something outside of Him which surrounds Him. And none 
the less will the talk concerning those that contain, and those that are 
contained, flow on into infinitude; and all [the Aeons] will most clearly appear 
to be bodies enclosed [by one another].
7. Further, they must also confess either that He is mere vacuity, or that 
the entire universe is within Him; and in that case all will in like degree 
partake of the Father. Just as, if one forms circles in water, or round or 
square figures, all these will equally partake of water; just as those, again, 
which are framed in the air, must necessarily partake of air, and those which 
[are formed] in light, of light; so must those also who are within Him all 
equally partake of the Father, ignorance having no place among them. Where, 
then, is this partaking of the Father who fills [all things]? If, indeed, He has 
filled [all things], there will be no ignorance among them. On this ground, 
then, their work of [supposed] degeneracy is brought to nothing, and the 
production of matter with the formation of the rest of the world; which things 
they maintain to have derived their substance from passion and ignorance. If, on 
the other hand, they acknowledge that He is vacuity, then they fall into the 
greatest blasphemy; they deny His spiritual nature. For how can He be a 
spiritual being, who cannot fill even those things which are within Him?
8. Now, these remarks which have been made concerning the emission of 
intelligence are in like manner applicable in opposition to those who belong to 
the school of Basilides, as well as in opposition to the rest of the Gnostics, 
from whom these also (the Valentinians) have adopted the ideas about emissions, 
and were refuted in the first book. But I have now plainly shown that the first 
production of Nous, that is, of the intelligence they speak of, is an untenable 
and impossible opinion. And let us see how the matter stands with respect to the 
rest [of the Aeons]. For they maintain that Logos and Zoe were sent forth by him 
(i.e., Nous) as fashioners of this Pleroma; while they conceive of an emission 
of Logos, that is, the Word after the analogy of human feelings, and rashly form 
conjectures respecting God, as if they had discovered something wonderful in 
their assertion that Logos was I produced by Nous. All indeed have a clear 
perception that this may be logically affirmed with respect to men.
But in Him who is God over all, since He is all Nous, and all Logos, as I have 
said before, and has in Himself nothing more ancient or late than another, and 
nothing at variance with another, but continues altogether equal, and similar, 
and homogeneous, there is no longer ground for conceiving of such production in 
the order which has been mentioned. Just as he does not err who declares that 
God is all vision, and all hearing (for in what manner He sees, in that also He 
hears; and in what manner He hears, in that also He sees), so also he who 
affirms that He is all intelligence, and all word, and that, in whatever respect 
He is intelligence, in that also He is word, and that this Nous is His Logos, 
will still indeed have only an inadequate conception of the Father of all, but 
will entertain far more becoming [thoughts regarding Him] than do those who 
transfer the generation of the word to which men gave utterance to the eternal 
Word of God, assigning a beginning and course of production [to Him], even as 
they do to their own word. And in what respect will the Word of God-yea, rather 
God Himself, since He is the Word-differ from the word of men, if He follows the 
same order and process of generation?
9. They have fallen into error, too, respecting Zoe, by maintaining that she 
was produced in the sixth place, when it behoved her to take precedence of all 
[the rest], since God is life, and incorruption, and truth. And these and such 
like attributes have not been produced according to a gradual scale of descent, 
but they are names of those perfections which always exist in God, so far as it 
is possible and proper for men to hear and to speak of God. For with the name of 
God the following words will harmonize: intelligence, word, life, incorruption, 
truth, wisdom, goodness, and such like. And neither can any one maintain that 
intelligence is more ancient than life, for intelligence itself is life; nor 
that life is later than intelligence, so that He who is the intellect of all, 
that is God, should at one time have been destitute of life. But if they affirm 
that life was indeed [previously] in the Father, but was produced in the sixth 
place in order that the Word might live, surely it ought long before, [according 
to such reasoning, ] to have been sent forth, in the fourth place, that Nous 
might have life; and still further, even before Him, [it should have been] with 
Bythus, that their Bythus might live. For to reckon Sige, indeed, along with 
their Propator, and to assign her to Him as His consort, while they do not join 
Zoe to the number,-is not this to surpass all other madness?
10. Again, as to the second production which proceeds from these [Aeons who 
have been mentioned],-that, namely, of Homo and Ecclesia,-their very fathers, 
falsely styled Gnostics, strive among themselves, each one seeking to make good 
his own opinions, and thus convicting themselves of being wicked thieves. They 
maintain that it is more suitable to [the theory of] production-as being, in 
fact, truth-like-that the Word was produced by man, and not man by the Word; and 
that man existed prior to the Word, and that this is really He who is God over 
all. And thus it is, as I have previously remarked, that heaping together with a 
kind of plausibility all human feelings, and mental exercises, and formation of 
intentions, and utterances of words, they have lied with no plausibility at all 
against God. For while they ascribe the things which happen to men, and 
whatsoever they recognise themselves as experiencing, to the divine reason, they 
seem to those who are ignorant of God to make statements suitable enough. And by 
these human passions, drawing away their intelligence, while they describe the 
origin and production of the Word of God in the fifth place, they assert that 
thus they teach wonderful mysteries, unspeakable and sublime, known to no one 
but themselves. It was, [they affirm, ] concerning these that the Lord said, 
"Seek, and ye shall find,"
that is, that they should inquire how Nous and Aletheia proceeded from Bythus 
and Sage; whether Logos and Zoe again derive their origin from these and then, 
whether Anthropos and Ecclesia proceed from Logos and Zoe.

Chapter XIV.-Valentinus and His 
  Followers Derived the Principles of Their System from the Heathen; The Names 
  Only are Changed.
1. Much more like the truth, and more pleasing, is the account which 
Antiphanes,
one of the ancient comic poets, gives in his Theogony as to the origin of 
all things. For he speaks Chaos as being produced from Night and Silence; 
relates that then Love
sprang from Chaos and Night; from this again, Light; and that from this, in his 
opinion, were derived all the rest of the first generation of the gods. After 
these he next introduces a second generation of gods, and the creation of the 
world; then he narrates the formation of mankind by the second order of the 
gods. These men (the heretics), adopting this fable as their own, have ranged 
their opinions round it, as if by a sort of natural process, changing only the 
names of the things referred to, and setting forth the very same beginning of 
the generation of all things, and their production. In place of Night and 
Silence they substitute Bythus and Sige; instead of Chaos, they put Nous; and 
for Love (by whom, says the comic poet, all other things were set in order) they 
have brought forward the Word; while for the primary and greatest gods they have 
formed the Aeons; and in place of the secondary gods, they tell us of that 
creation by their mother which is outside of the Pleroma, calling it the second 
Ogdoad. They proclaim to us, like the writer referred to, that from this 
(Ogdoad) came the creation of the world and the formation of man, maintaining 
that they alone are acquainted with these ineffable and unknown mysteries. Those 
things which are everywhere acted in the theatres by comedians with the clearest 
voices they transfer to their own system, teaching them undoubtedly through 
means of the same arguments, and merely changing the names.
2. And not only are they convicted of bringing forward, as if their own 
[original ideas], those things which are to be found among the comic poets, but 
they also bring together the things which have been said by all those who were 
ignorant of God, and who are termed philosophers; and sewing together, as it 
were, a motley garment out of a heap of miserable rags, they have, by their 
subtle manner of expression, furnished themselves with a cloak which is really 
not their own. They do, it is true, introduce a new kind of doctrine, inasmuch 
as by a new sort of art it has been substituted [for the old]. Yet it is in 
reality both old and useless, since these very opinions have been sewed together 
out of ancient dogmas redolent of ignorance and irreligion. For instance, 
Thales
of Miletus affirmed that water was the generative and initial principle of all 
things. Now it is just the same thing whether we say water or 
Bythus. The poet Homer,
again, held the opinion that Oceanus, along with mother Tethys, was the origin 
of the gods: this idea these men have transferred to Bythus and Sige. 
Anaximander laid it down that infinitude is the first principle of all things, 
having seminally in itself the generation of them all, and from this he declares 
the immense worlds [which exist] were formed: this, too, they have dressed up 
anew, and referred to Bythus and their Aeons. Anaxagoras, again, who has also 
been surnamed "Atheist," gave it as his opinion that animals were formed from 
seeds falling down from heaven upon earth. This thought, too, these men have 
transferred to "the seed" of their Mother, which they maintain to be themselves; 
thus acknowledging at once, in the judgment of such as are possessed of sense, 
that they themselves are the offspring of the irreligious Anaxagoras.
3. Again, adopting the [ideas of] shade and vacuity from Democritus and 
Epicurus, they have fitted these to their own views, following upon those 
[teachers] who had already talked a great deal about a vacuum and atoms, the one 
of which they called that which is, and the other that which is 
not. In like manner, these men call those things which are within the 
Pleroma real existences, just as those philosophers did the atoms; while they 
maintain that those which are without the Pleroma have no true existence, even 
as those did respecting the vacuum. They have thus banished themselves in this 
world (since they are here outside of the Pleroma) into a place which has no 
existence. Again, when they maintain that these things [below] are images of 
those which have a true existence [above], they again most manifestly rehearse 
the doctrine of Democritus and Plato. For Democritus was the first who 
maintained that numerous and diverse figures were stamped, as it were, with the 
forms [of things above], and descended from universal space into this world. But 
Plato, for his part, speaks of matter, and exemplar, 
and God. These men, following those distinctions, have styled what he calls 
ideas, and exemplar, the images of those things which are above; while, 
through a mere change of name, they boast themselves as being discoverers and 
contrivers of this kind of imaginary fiction.
4. This opinion, too, that they hold the Creator formed the world out of 
previously existing matter, both Anaxagoras, Empedocles, and Plato expressed 
before them; as, forsooth, we learn they also do under the inspiration of their 
Mother. Then again, as to the opinion that everything of necessity passes away 
to those things out of which they maintain it was also formed, and that God is 
the slave of this necessity, so that He cannot impart immortality to what is 
mortal, or bestow incorruption on what is corruptible, but every one passes into 
a substance similar in nature to itself, both those who are named Stoics from 
the portico (stoa\ ), and indeed all that are ignorant 
of God, poets and historians alike, make the same affirmation.
Those [heretics] who hold the same [system of] infidelity have ascribed, no 
doubt, their own proper region to spiritual beings,-that, namely, which is 
within the Pleroma, but to animal beings the intermediate space, while to 
corporeal they assign that which is material. And they assert that God Himself 
can do no otherwise, but that every one of the [different kinds of substance] 
mentioned passes away to those things which are of the same nature. [with 
itself].
5. Moreover, as to their saying that the Saviour was formed out of all the 
Aeons, by every one of them depositing, so to speak, in Him his own special 
flower, they bring forward nothing new that may not be found in the Pandora of 
Hesiod. For what he says respecting her, these men insinuate concerning the 
Saviour, bringing Him before us as Pandoros (All-gifted), as if each of the 
Aeons had bestowed on Him what He possessed in the greatest perfection. Again, 
their opinion as to the indifference of [eating of] meats and other actions, and 
as to their thinking that, from the nobility of their nature, they can in no 
degree at all contract pollution, whatever they eat or perform, they have 
derived it from the Cynics, since they do in fact belong to the same society as 
do these [philosophers]. They also strive to transfer to [the treatment of 
matters of] faith that hairsplitting and subtle mode of handling questions which 
is, in fact, a copying of Aristotle.
6. Again, as to the desire they exhibit to refer this whole universe to 
numbers, they have learned it from the Pythagoreans. For these were the first 
who set forth numbers as the initial principle of all things, and [described] 
that initial principle of theirs as being both equal and unequal, out of which 
[two properties] they conceived that both things sensible
and immaterial derived their origin. And [they held] that one set of first 
principles gave rise to the matter [of things], and another to their form. They affirm that 
from these first principles all things have been made, just as a statue is of 
its metal and its special form. Now, the heretics have adapted this to the 
things which are outside of the Pleroma. The [Pythagoreans] maintained that 
the principle of intellect is proportionate to the energy wherewith mind, as a 
recipient of the comprehensible, pursues its inquiries, until, worn out, it is 
resolved at length in the Indivisible and One. They further affirm that Hen-that 
is, One-is the first principle of all things, and the substance of all that has 
been formed. From this again proceeded the Dyad, the Tetrad, the Pentad, and the 
manifold generation of the others. These things the heretics repeat, word for 
word, with a reference to their Pleroma and Bythus. From the same source, too, 
they strive to bring into vogue those conjunctions which proceed from unity. 
Marcus boasts of such views as if they were his own, and as if he were seen to 
have discovered something more novel than others, while he simply sets forth the 
Tetrad of Pythagoras as the originating principle and mother of all things.
7. But I will merely say, in opposition to these men-Did all those who have 
been mentioned, with whom you have been proved to coincide in expression, know, 
or not know, the truth? If they knew it, then the descent of the Saviour into 
this world was superfluous. For why [in that case] did He descend? Was it that 
He might bring that truth which was [already] known to the knowledge of those 
who knew it? If, on the other hand, these men did not know it, then how 
is it that, while you express yourselves in the same terms as do those who knew 
not the truth, ye boast that yourselves alone possess that knowledge which is 
above all things, although they who are ignorant of God [likewise] possess it? 
Thus, then, by a complete perversion of language, they style ignorance of the truth knowledge: and Paul well says [of 
them, that [they make use of] "novelties of words of false knowledge."
For that knowledge of theirs is truly found to be false. If, however, taking an 
impudent course with respect to these points, they declare that men indeed did 
not know the truth, but that their Mother,
the seed of the Father, proclaimed the mysteries of truth through such men, even 
as also through the prophets, while the Demiurge was ignorant [of the 
proceeding], then I answer, in the first place, that the things which were 
predicted were not of such a nature as to be intelligible to no one; for the men 
themselves knew what they were saying, as did also their disciples, and those 
again succeeded these. And, in the next place, if either the Mother or her seed 
knew and proclaimed those things which were of the truth (and the Father
is truth), then on their theory the Saviour spoke falsely when He said, "No one 
knoweth the Father but the Son,"
unless indeed they maintain that their seed or Mother is No-one.
8. Thus far, then, by means of [ascribing to their Aeons] human feelings, and 
by the fact that they largely coincide in their language with many of those who 
are ignorant of God, they have been seen plausibly drawing a certain number away 
[from the truth]. They lead them on by the use of those [expressions] with which 
they have been familiar, to that sort of discourse which treats of all things, 
setting forth the production of the Word of God, and of Zoe, and of Nous, and 
bringing into the world, as it were, the [successive] emanations of the Deity. 
The views, again, which they propound, without either plausibility or parade, 
are simply lies from beginning to end. Just as those who, in order to lure and 
capture any kind of animals, place their accustomed food before them, gradually 
drawing them on by means of the familiar aliment, until at length they seize it, 
but, when they have taken them captive, they subject them to the bitterest of 
bendage, and drag them along with violence whithersoever they please; so also do 
these men gradually and gently persuading [others], by means of their plausible 
speeches, to accept of the emission which has been mentioned, then bring forward 
things which are not consistent, and forms of the remaining emissions which are 
not such as might have been expected. They declare, for instance, that 
[ten] Aeons were sent forth by Logos and Zoe, while from Anthropos and Ecclesia there 
proceeded twelve, although they have neither proof, nor testimony, nor 
probability, nor anything whatever of such a nature [to support these 
assertions]; and with equal folly and audacity do they wish it to be believed 
that from Logos and Zoe, being Aeons, were sent forth Bythus and Mixis, Ageratos 
and Henosis, Autophyes and Hedone, Acinetos and Syncrasis, Monogenes and 
Macaria. Moreover, [as they affirm, ] there were sent forth, in a similar way, 
from Anthropos and Ecclesia, being Aeons, Paracletus and Pistis, Patricos and 
Elpis, Metricos and Agape, Ainos and Synesis, Ecclesiasticus and Macariotes, 
Theletos and Sophia.
9. The passions and error of this Sophia, and how she ran the risk of 
perishing through her investigation [of the nature] of the Father, as they 
relate, and what took place outside of the Pleroma, and from what sort of a 
defect they teach that the Maker of the world was produced, I have set forth in 
the preceding book, describing in it, with all diligence, the opinions of these 
heretics. [I have also detailed their views] respecting Christ, whom they 
describe as having been produced subsequently to all these, and also regarding 
Soter, who, [according to them, ] derived his being from those Aeons who were 
formed within the Pleroma.
But I have of necessity mentioned their names at present, that from these the 
absurdity of their falsehood may be made manifest, and also the confused nature 
of the nomenclature they have devised. For they themselves detract from [the 
dignity of] their Aeons by a multitude of names of this sort. They give out 
names plausible and credible to the heathen, [as being similar] to those who are 
called their twelve gods,
and even these they will have to be images of their twelve Aeons. But the images 
[so called] can produce names [of their own] much more seemly, and more powerful 
through their etymology to indicate divinity [than are those of their fancied 
prototypes].

Chapter XV.-No Account Can Be Given 
  of These Productions.
1. But let us return to the fore-mentioned question as to the production [of 
the Aeons]. And, in the first place, let them tell us the reason of the 
production of the Aeons being of such a kind that they do not come in contact 
with any of those things which belong to creation. For they maintain that those 
things [above] were not made on account of creation, but creation on account of 
them; and that the former are not images of the latter, but the latter of the 
former. As, therefore, they render a reason for the images, by saying that the 
month has thirty days on account of the thirty Aeons, and the day twelve hours, 
and the year twelve months, on account of the twelve Aeons which are within the 
Pleroma, with other such nonsense of the same kind, let them now tell us also 
the reason for that production of the Aeons, why it was of such a nature, for 
what reason the first and first-begotten Ogdoad was sent forth, and not a 
Pentad, or a Triad, or a Septenad, or any one of those which are defined by a 
different number? Moreover, how did it come to pass, that from Logos and Zoe 
were sent forth ten Aeons, and neither more nor less; while again from Anthropos 
and Ecclesia proceeded twelve, although these might have been either more or 
less numerous?
2. And then, again, with reference to the entire Pleroma, what reason is 
there that it should be divided into these three-an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a 
Duodecad-and not into some other number different from these? Moreover, with 
respect to the division itself, why has it been made into three parts, 
and not into four, or five, or six, or into some other number among those which 
have no connection with such numbers
as belong to creation? For they describe those [Aeons above] as being more 
ancient than these [created things below], and it behoves them to possess their 
principle [of being] in themselves, one which existed before creation, and not 
after the pattern of creation, all exactly agreeing as to the point.

3. The account which we give of creation is one harmonious with that regular 
order [of things prevailing in the world], for this scheme of ours is adapted to 
the things which have [actually] been made; but it is a matter of necessity that 
they, being unable to assign any reason belonging to the things themselves, with 
regard to those beings that existed before [creation], and were perfected by 
themselves, should fall into the greatest perplexity. For, as to the points on 
which they interrogate us as knowing nothing of creation, they themselves, when 
questioned in turn respecting the Pleroma, either make mention of mere human 
feelings, or have recourse to that sort of speech which bears only upon that 
harmony observable in creation, improperly giving us replies concerning things 
which are secondary, and not concerning those which, as they maintain, are 
primary. For we do not question them concerning that harmony which belongs to 
creation, nor concerning human feelings; but because they must acknowledge, as 
to their octiform, deciform, and duodeciform Pleroma (the image of which they 
declare creation to be), that their Father formed it of that figure vainly and 
thoughtlessly, and must ascribe to Him deformity, if He made anything without a 
reason. Or, again, if they declare that the Pleroma was so produced in 
accordance with the foresight of the Father, for the sake of creation, as if He 
had thus symmetrically arranged its very essence, then it follows that the 
Pleroma can no longer be regarded as having been formed on its own account, but 
for the sake of that [creation] which was to be its image as possessing its 
likeness (just as the clay model is not moulded for its own sake, but for the 
sake of the statue in brass, or gold, or silver about to be formed), then 
creation will have greater honour than the Pleroma, if, for its sake, those 
things [above] were produced.

Chapter XVI.-The Creator of the 
  World Either Produced of Himself the Images of Things to Be Made, or the 
  Pleroma Was Formed After the Image of Some Previous System; And So on a.d. 
  Infinitum.
1. But if they will not yield assent to any one of these conclusions, since 
in that case they would be proved by us as incapable of rendering any reason for 
such a production of their Pleroma, they will of necessity be shut up to 
this-that they confess that, above the Pleroma, there was some other system more 
spiritual and more powerful, after the image of which their Pleroma was formed. 
For if the Demiurge did not of himself construct that figure of creation which 
exists, but made it after the form of those things which are above, then from 
whom did their Bythus-who, to be sure, brought it about that the Pleroma should 
be possessed of a configuration of this kind-receive the figure of those things 
which existed before Himself? For it must needs be, either that the intention 
[of creating] dwelt in that god who made the world, so that of his own power, 
and from himself, he obtained the model of its formation; or, if any departure 
is made from this being, then there will arise a necessity for constantly asking 
whence there came to that one who is above him the configuration of those things 
which have been made; what, too, was the number of the productions; and what the 
substance of the model itself? If, however, it was in the power of Bythus to 
impart of himself such a configuration to the Pleroma, then why may it not have 
been in the power of the Demiurge to form of himself such a world as exists? And 
then, again, if creation be an image of those things [above], why should we not 
affirm that those are, in turn, images of others above them, and those above 
these again, of others, and thus go on supposing innumerable images of 
images?
2. This difficulty presented itself to Basilides after he had utterly missed 
the truth, and was conceiving that, by an infinite succession of those beings 
that were formed from one another, he might escape such perplexity. When he had 
proclaimed that three hundred and sixty-five heavens were formed through 
succession and similitude by one another, and that a manifest proof [of the 
existence] of these was found in the number of the days of the year, as I stated 
before; and that above these there was a power which they also style Unnameable, 
and its dispensation-he did not even in this way escape such perplexity. For, 
when asked whence came the image of its configuration to that heaven which is 
above all, and from which he wishes the rest to be regarded as having been 
formed by means of succession, he will say, from that dispensation which belongs 
to the Unnameable. He must then say, either that the Unspeakable formed it of 
himself, or he will find it necessary to acknowledge that there is some other 
power above this being, from whom his unnameable One derived such vast numbers 
of configurations as do, according to him, exist.
3. How much safer and more accurate a course is it, then, to confess at once 
that which is true: that this God, the Creator, who formed the world, is the 
only God, and that there is no other God besides Him-He Himself receiving from 
Himself the model and figure of those things which have been made-than that, 
after wearying ourselves with such an impious and circuitous description, we 
should be compelled, at some point or another, to fix the mind on some One, and 
to confess that from Him proceeded the configuration of things created.
4. As to the accusation brought against us by the followers of Valentinus, 
when they declare that we continue in that Hebdomad which is below, as if we 
could not lift our minds on high, nor understand those things which are above, 
because we do not accept their monstrous assertions: this very charge do the 
followers of Basilides bring in turn against them, inasmuch as they (the 
Valentinians) keep circling about those things which are below, [going] as far 
as the first and second Ogdoad, and because they unskilfully imagine that, 
immediately after the thirty Aeons, they have discovered Him who is above all 
things Father, not following out in thought their investigations to that Pleroma 
which is above the three hundred and sixty-five heavens, which
is above forty-five Ogdoads. And any one, again, might bring against them the 
same charge, by imagining four thousand three hundred and eighty heavens, or 
Aeons, since the days of the year contain that number of hours. If, again, some 
one adds also the nights, thus doubling the hours which have been mentioned, 
imagining that [in this way] he has discovered a great multitude of Ogdoads, and 
a kind of innumerable company
of Aeons, and thus, in opposition to Him who is above all things Father, 
conceiving himself more perfect than all [others], he will bring the same charge 
against all, inasmuch as they are not capable of rising to the conception of 
such a multitude of heavens or Aeons as he has announced, but are either so 
deficient as to remain among those things which are below, or continue in the 
intermediate space.

Chapter XVII.-Inquiry into the 
  Production of the Aeons: Whatever Its Supposed Nature, It is in Every Respect 
  Inconsistent; And on the Hypothesis of the Heretics, Even Nous and the Father 
  Himself Would Be Stained with Ignorance.
1. That system, then, which has respect to their Pleroma, and especially that 
part of it which refers to the primary Ogdoad being thus burdened with so great 
contradictions and perplexities, let me now go on to examine the remainder of 
their scheme. [In doing so] on account of their madness, I shall be making 
inquiry respecting things which have no real existence; yet it is necessary to 
do this, since the treatment of this subject has been entrusted to me, and since 
I desire all men to come to the knowledge of the truth, as well as because thou 
thyself hast asked to receive from me full and complete means for overturning 
[the views of] these men.
2. I ask, then, in what manner were the rest of the Aeons produced? Was it so 
as to be united with Him who produced them, even as the solar rays are with the 
sun; or was it actually
and separately, so that each of them possessed an independent existence and his 
own special form, just as has a man from another man, and one herd of cattle 
from another? Or was it after the manner of germination, as branches from a 
tree? And were they of the same substance with those who produced them, or did 
they derive their substance from some other [kind of] substance? Also, were they 
produced at the same time, so as to be contemporaries; or after a certain order, 
so that some of them were older, and others younger? And, again, are they 
uncompounded and uniform, and altogether equal and similar among themselves, as 
spirit and light are produced; or are they compounded and different, unlike [to 
each other] in their members?
3. If each of them was produced, after the manner of men, actually and 
according to its own generation, then either those thus generated by the Father 
will be of the same substance with Him, and similar to their Author; or 
if they appear dissimilar, then it must of necessity be acknowledged that they are 
[formed of some different substance. Now, if the beings generated by the Father 
be similar to their Author, then those who have been produced must remain for 
ever impossible, even as is He who produced them; but if, on the other hand, 
they are of a different substance, which is capable of passion, then whence came 
this dissimilar substance to find a place within the incorruptible Pleroma? 
Further, too, according to this principle, each one of them must be understood 
as being completely separated from every other, even as men are not mixed with 
nor united the one to the other, but each having a distinct shape of his own, 
and a definite sphere of action, while each one of them, too, is formed of a 
particular size,-qualities characteristic of a body, and not of a spirit. Let 
them therefore no longer speak of the Pleroma as being spiritual, or of 
themselves as "spiritual," if indeed their Aeons sit feasting with the Father, 
just as if they were men, and He Himself is of such a configuration as those 
reveal Him to be who were produced by Him.
4. If, again, the Aeons were derived from Logos, Logos from Nous, and Nous 
from Bythus, just as lights are kindled from a light-as, for example, torches 
are from a torch-then they may no doubt differ in generation and size from one 
another; but since they are of the same substance with the Author of their 
production, they must either all remain for ever impossible, or their Father 
Himself must participate in passion. For the torch which has been kindled 
subsequently cannot be possessed of a different kind of light from that which 
preceded it. Wherefore also their lights, when blended in one, return to the 
original identity, since that one light is then formed which has existed even 
from the beginning. But we cannot speak, with respect to light itself, of some 
part being more recent in its origin, and another being more ancient (for the 
whole is but one light); nor can we so speak even in regard to those torches 
which have received the light (for these are all contemporary as respects their 
material substance, for the substance of torches is one and the same), but 
simply as to [the time of] its being kindled, since one was lighted a little 
while ago, and another has just now been kindled.
5. The defect, therefore, of that passion which has regard to ignorance, will 
either attach alike to their whole Pleroma, since [all its members] are of the 
same substance; and the Propator will share in this defect of ignorance-that is, 
will be ignorant of Himself; or, on the other hand, all those lights which are 
within the Pleroma will alike remain for ever impassible.Whence, then, comes the 
passion of the youngest Aeon, if the light of the Father is that from which all 
other lights have been formed, and which is by nature impassible? And how can 
one Aeon be spoken of as either younger or older among themselves, since there 
is but one light in the entire Pleroma? And if any one calls them stars, they 
will all nevertheless appear to participate in the same nature. For if "one star 
differs from another star in glory,"
but not in qualities, nor substance, nor in the fact of being passible or 
impassible; so all these, since they are alike derived from the light of the 
Father, must either be naturally impossible and immutable, or they must all, in 
common with the light of the Father, be passible, and are capable of the varying 
phases of corruption.
6. The same conclusion will follow, although they affirm that the production 
of Aeons sprang from Logos, as branches from a tree, since Logos has his 
generation from their Father. For all [the Aeons] are formed of the same 
substance with the Father, differing from one another only in size, and not in 
nature, and filling up the greatness of the Father, even as the fingers complete 
the hand. If therefore He exists in passion and ignorance, so must also those 
Aeons who have been generated by Him. But if it is impious to ascribe ignorance 
and passion to the Father of all, how can they describe an Aeon produced by Him 
as being passible; and while they ascribe the same impiety to the very wisdom 
(Sophia) of God, how can they still call themselves religious men?
7. If, again, they declare that their Aeons were sent forth just as rays are 
from the sun, then, since all are of the same substance and sprung from the same 
source, all must either be capable of passion along with Him who produced them, 
or all will remain impassible for ever. For they can no longer maintain that, of 
beings so produced, some are impassible and others passible. If, then, they 
declare all impassible, they do themselves destroy their own argument. For how 
could the youngest Aeon have suffered passion if all were impassible? If, on the 
other hand, they declare that all partook of this passion, as indeed some of 
them venture to maintain, then, inasmuch as it originated with Logos,
but flowed onwards to Sophia, they will thus be convicted of tracing back the 
passion to Logos, who is the
Nous of this Propator, and so acknowledging the Nous of the Propator and the 
Father Himself to have experienced passion. For the Father of all is not to be 
regarded as a kind of compound Being, who can be separated from his Nous (mind), 
as I have already shown; but Nous is the Father, and the Father Nous. It 
necessarily follows, therefore, both that he who springs from Him as Logos, or 
rather that Nous himself, since he is Logos, must be perfect and impassible, and 
that those productions which proceed from him, seeing that they are of the same 
substance with himself, should be perfect and impassible, and should ever remain 
similar to him who produced them.
8. It cannot therefore longer be held, as these men teach, that Logos, as 
occupying the third place in generation, was ignorant of the Father. Such a 
thing might indeed perhaps be deemed probable in the case of the generation of 
human beings, inasmuch as these frequently know nothing of their parents; but it 
is altogether impossible in the case of the Logos of the Father. For if, 
existing in the Father, he knows Him in whom he exists-that is, is not ignorant 
of himself-then those productions which issue from him being his powers 
(faculties), and always present with him, will not be ignorant of him who 
emitted them, any more than rays [may be supposed to be] of the sun. It is 
impossible, therefore, that the Sophia (wisdom) of God, she who is within the 
Pleroma, inasmuch as she has been produced in such a manner, should have fallen 
under the influence of passion, and conceived such ignorance. But it is possible 
that that Sophia (wisdom) who pertains to [the scheme] of Valentinus, inasmuch 
as she is a production of the devil, should fall into every kind of passion, and 
exhibit the profoundest ignorance. For when they themselves bear testimony 
concerning their mother, to the effect that she was the offspring of an erring 
Aeon, we need no longer search for a reason why the sons of such a mother should 
be ever swimming in the depths of ignorance.
9. I am not aware that, besides these productions [which have been 
mentioned], they are able to speak of any other; indeed, they have not been 
known to me (although I have had very frequent discussions with them concerning 
forms of this kind) as ever setting forth any other peculiar kind of being as 
produced [in the manner under consideration]. This only they maintain, that each 
one of these was so produced as to know merely that one who produced him, 
while he was ignorant of the one who immediately preceded. But they do not in 
this matter go forward [in their account] with any kind of demonstration as to 
the manner in which these were produced, or how such a thing could take place 
among spiritual beings. For, in whatsoever way they may choose to go forward, 
they will feel themselves bound (while, as regards the truth, they depart 
entirely from right reason) to proceed so far as to maintain that their Word, 
who springs from the Nous of the Propator,-to maintain, I say, that he was 
produced in a state of degeneracy. For [they hold] that perfect Nous, previously 
begotten by the perfect Bythus, was not capable of rendering that production 
which issued from him perfect, but [could only bring it forth] utterly blind to 
the knowledge and greatness of the Father. They also maintain that the Saviour 
exhibited an emblem of this mystery in the case of that man who was blind from 
his birth,
since the Aeon was in this manner produced by Monogenes blind, that is, in 
ignorance, thus falsely ascribing ignorance and blindness to the Word of God, 
who, according to their own theory, holds the second [place of] production from 
the Propator. Admirable sophists, and explorers of the sublimities of the 
unknown Father, and rehearsers of those super-celestial mysteries "which the 
angels desire to look into!"
-that they may learn that from the Nous of that Father who is above all, the 
Word was produced blind, that is, ignorant of the Father who produced 
him! 
10. But, ye miserable sophists, how could the Nous of the Father, or rather 
the very Father Himself, since He is Nous and perfect in all things, have 
produced his own Logos as an imperfect and blind Aeon, when He was able also to 
produce along with him the knowledge of the Father? As ye affirm that Christ was 
generated
after the rest, and yet declare that he was produced perfect, much more then 
should Logos, who is anterior to him in age, be produced by the same Nous, 
unquestionably perfect, and not blind; nor could he, again, have produced Aeons 
still blinder than himself, until at last your Sophia, always utterly blinded, 
gave birth to so vast a body of evils. And your Father is the cause of all this 
mischief; for ye declare the magnitude and power of your Father to be the causes 
of ignorance, assimilating Him to Bythus, and assigning this as a name to Him 
who is the unnameable Father. But if ignorance is an evil, and ye declare all 
evils to have derived their strength from it, while ye maintain that the 
greatness and power of the Father is the cause of this ignorance, ye do thus set 
Him forth as the author of [all] evils. For ye state as the cause of evil this 
fact, that [no one] could contemplate His greatness. But if it was really 
impossible for the Father to make Himself known from the beginning to those 
[beings] that were formed by Him, He must in that case be held free from blame, 
inasmuch as He could not remove the ignorance of those who came after 
Him. But if, at a subsequent period, when He so willed it, He could take 
away that ignorance which had increased with the successive productions as they 
followed each other, and thus become deeply seated in the Aeons, much more, had 
He so willed it might He formerly have prevented that ignorance, which as yet 
was not, from coining into existence.
11. Since therefore, as soon as He so pleased, He did become known not only 
to the Aeons, but also to these men who lived in these latter times; but, as He 
did not so please to be known from the beginning, He remained unknown-the cause 
of ignorance is, according to you, the will of the Father. For if He foreknew 
that these things would in future happen in such a manner, why then did He not 
guard against the ignorance of these beings before it had obtained a place among 
them, rather than afterwards, as if under the influence of repentance, deal with 
it through the production of Christ? For the knowledge which through Christ He 
conveyed to all, He might long before have imparted through Logos, who was also 
the first-begotten of Monogenes. Or if, knowing them beforehand, He willed that 
these things should happen [as they have done], then the works of ignorance must 
endure for ever, and never pass away. For the things which have been made in 
accordance with the will of your Propator must continue along with the will of 
Him who willed them; or if they pass away, the will of Him also who decreed that 
they should have a being will pass away along with them. And why did the Aeons 
find rest and attain perfect knowledge through learning [at last] that the 
Father is altogether incomprehensible? They might surely have possessed this knowledge before they 
became involved in passion; for the greatness of the Father did not suffer 
diminution from the beginning, so that these might
know that He was altogether incomprehensible. For if, on account of His infinite 
greatness, He remained unknown, He ought also on account of His infinite love to 
have preserved those impassible who were produced by Him, since nothing 
hindered, and expediency rather required, that they should have known from the 
beginning that the Father was altogether incomprehensible.

Chapter XVIII.-Sophia Was Never 
  Really in Ignorance or Passion; Her Enthymesis Could Not Have Been Separated 
  from Herself, or Exhibited Special Tendencies of Its Own.
1. How can it be regarded as otherwise than absurd, that they also affirm 
this Sophia (wisdom) to have been involved in ignorance, and degeneracy, and 
passion? For these things are alien and contrary to wisdom, nor can they ever be 
qualities belonging to it. For wherever there is a want of foresight, and an 
ignorance of the course of utility, there wisdom does not exist. Let them 
therefore no longer call this suffering Aeon, Sophia, but let them give up 
either her name or her sufferings. And let them, moreover, not call their entire 
Pleroma spiritual, if this Aeon had a place within it when she was involved in 
such a tumult of passion. For even a vigorous soul, not to say a spiritual 
substance, would not pass through any such experience.
2. And, again, how could her Enthymesis, going forth [from her] along with 
the passion, have become a separate existence? For Enthymesis (thought) is 
understood in connection with some person, and can never have an isolated 
existence by itself. For a bad Enthymesis is destroyed and absorbed by a good 
one, even as a state of disease is by health. What, then, was the sort of 
Enthymesis which preceded that of passion? [It was this]: to investigate the 
[nature of] the Father, and to consider His greatness. But what did she 
afterwards become persuaded of, and so was restored to health? [This, viz.], 
that the Father is incomprehensible, and that He is past finding out. It was 
not, then, a proper feeling that she wished to know the Father, and on this 
account she became passible; but when she became persuaded that He is 
unsearchable, she was restored to health. And even Nous himself, who was 
inquiring into the [nature of] the Father, ceased, according to them, to 
continue his researches, on learning that the Father is incomprehensible.
3. How then could the Enthymesis separately conceive passions, which 
themselves also were her affections? For affection is necessarily connected with 
an individual: it cannot come into being or exist apart by itself. This opinion 
[of theirs], however, is not only untenable, but also opposed to that which was 
spoken by our Lord: "Seek, and ye shall find." 
For the Lord renders His disciples perfect by their seeking after and finding 
the Father; but that Christ of theirs, who is above, has rendered them perfect, 
by the fact that He has commanded the Aeons not to seek after the Father, 
persuading them that, though they should labour hard, they would not find Him. 
And they
declare that they themselves are perfect, by the fact that they maintain they 
have found their Bythus; while the Aeons [have been made perfect] through means 
of this, that He is unsearchable who was inquired after by them.
4. Since, therefore, the Enthymesis herself could not exist separately, apart 
from the Aeon, [it is obvious that] they bring forward still greater falsehood 
concerning her passion, when they further proceed to divide and separate it from 
her, while they declare that it was the substance of matter. As if God were not 
light, and as if no Word existed who could convict them, and overthrow their 
wickedness. For it is certainly true, that whatsoever the Aeon thought, that she 
also suffered; and what she suffered, that she also thought. And her Enthymesis 
was, according to them, nothing else than the passion of one thinking how she 
might comprehend the incomprehensible. And thus Enthymesis (thought) was the passion; for she was 
thinking of things impossible. How then could affection and passion be separated 
and set apart from the Enthymesis, so as to become the substance of so vast a 
material creation, when Enthymesis herself was the passion, and the passion 
Enthymesis? Neither, therefore, can Enthymesis apart from the Aeon, nor the 
affections apart from Enthymesis, separately possess substance; and thus once 
more their system breaks down and is destroyed.
5. But how did it come to pass that the Aeon was both dissolved [into her 
component parts], and became subject to passion? She was undoubtedly of the same 
substance as the Pleroma; but the entire Pleroma was of the Father. Now, any 
substance, when brought in contact with what is of a similar nature, will not be 
dissolved into nothing, nor will be in danger of perishing, but will rather 
continue and increase, such as fire in fire, spirit in spirit, and water in 
water; but those which are of a contrary nature to each other do, [when they 
meet, ] suffer and are changed and destroyed. And, in like manner, if there had 
been a production of light, it would not suffer passion, or recur any danger in 
light like itself, but would rather glow with the greater brightness, and 
increase, as the day does from [the increasing brilliance of] the sun; for they 
maintain that Bythus [himself] was the image of their father 
(Sophia). Whatever animals are alien [in habits] and strange to each other, or 
are mutually opposed in nature, fall into danger [on meeting together], and are 
destroyed; whereas, on the other hand, those who are accustomed to each other, 
and of a harmonious disposition, suffer no peril from being together in the same 
place, but rather secure both safety and life by such a fact. If, therefore, 
this Aeon was produced by the Pleroma of the same substance as the whole of it, 
she could never have undergone change, since she was consorting with beings 
similar to and familiar with herself, a spiritual essence among those that were 
spiritual. For fear, terror, passion, dissolution, and such like, may perhaps 
occur through the struggle of contraries among such beings as we are, who are 
possessed of bodies; but among spiritual beings, and those that have the light 
diffused among them, no such calamities can possibly happen. But these men 
appear to me to have endowed their Aeon with the [same sort of] passion as 
belongs to that character in the comic poet Menander,
who was himself deeply in love, but an object of hatred [to his beloved]. For 
those who have invented such opinions have rather had an idea and mental 
conception of some unhappy lover among men, than of a spiritual and divine 
substance.
6. Moreover, to meditate how to search into [the nature of] the perfect 
Father, and to have a desire to exist within Him, and to have a comprehension of 
His [greatness], could not entail the stain of ignorance or passion, and that 
upon a spiritual Aeon; but would rather [give rise to] perfection, and 
impassibility, and truth. For they do not say that even they, though they be but 
men, by meditating on Him who was before them,-and while now, as it were, 
comprehending the perfect, and being placed within the knowledge of Him,-are 
thus involved in a passion of perplexity, but rather attain to the knowledge and 
apprehension of truth. For they affirm that the Saviour said, "Seek, and ye 
shall find," to His disciples with this view, that they should seek after Him 
who, by means of imagination, has been conceived of by them as being above the 
Maker of all-the ineffable Bythus; and they desire themselves to be regarded as 
"the perfect; "because they have sought and found the perfect One, while they 
are still on earth. Yet they declare that that Aeon who was within the Pleroma, 
a wholly spiritual being, by seeking after the Propator, and endeavouring to 
find a place within His greatness, and desiring to have a comprehension of the 
truth of the Father, fell down into [the endurance of] passion, and such a 
passion that, unless she had met with that Power who upholds all things, she 
would have been dissolved into the general substance [of the Aeons], and thus 
come to an end of her [personal] existence.
7. Absurd is such presumption, and truly an opinion of men totally destitute 
of the truth. For, that this Aeon is superior to themselves, and of greater 
antiquity, they themselves acknowledge, according to their own system, when they 
affirm that they are the fruit of the Enthymesis of that Aeon who suffered 
passion, so that this Aeon is the father of their mother, that is, their own 
grandfather. And to them, the later grandchildren, the search after the Father 
brings, as they maintain, truth, and perfection, and establishment, and 
deliverance from unstable matter, and reconciliation to the Father; but on their 
grandfather this same search entailed ignorance, and passion, and terror, and 
perplexity, from which [disturbances] they also declare that the substance of 
matter was formed. To say, therefore, that the search after and investigation of 
the perfect Father, and the desire for communion and union with Him, were things 
quite beneficial to them, but to an Aeon, from whom also they derive their 
origin, these things were the cause of dissolution and destruction, how can such 
assertions be otherwise viewed than as totally inconsistent, foolish, and 
irrational? Those, too, who listen to these teachers, truly blind themselves, 
while they possess blind guides, justly [are left to] fall along with them into 
the gulf of ignorance which lies below them.

Chapter XIX.-Absurdities of the 
  Heretics as to Their Own Origin: Their Opinions Respecting the Demiurge Shown 
  to Be Equally Untenable and Ridiculous.
1. But what sort of talk also is this concerning their seed-that it was 
conceived by the mother according to the configuration of those angels who wait 
upon the Saviour,-shapeless, without form, and imperfect; and that it was 
deposited in the Demiurge without his knowledge, in order that through his 
instrumentality it might attain to perfection and form in that soul which he 
had, [so to speak, ] filled with seed? This is to affirm, in the first place, 
that those angels who wait upon their Saviour are imperfect, and with out figure 
or form; if indeed that which was conceived according to their appearance was 
generated any such kind of being [as has been described].
2. Then, in the next place, as to their saying that the Creator was ignorant 
of that deposit of seed which took place into him, and again, of that 
impartation of seed which was made by him to man, their words are futile and 
vain, and are in no way susceptible of proof. For how could he have been 
ignorant of it, if that seed had possessed any substance and peculiar 
properties? If, on the other hand, it was without substance and without quality, 
and so was really nothing, then, as a matter of course, he was ignorant of it. 
For those things which have a certain motion of their own, and quality, either 
of heat, or swiftness, or sweetness, or which differ from others in brilliance, 
do not escape the notice even of men, since they mingle in the sphere of human 
action: far less can they [be hidden from] God, the Maker of this universe. With 
reason, however, [is it said, that] their seed was not known to Him, since it is 
without any quality of general utility, and without the substance requisite for 
any action, and is, in fact, a pure nonentity. It really seems to me, that, with 
a view to such opinions, the Lord expressed Himself thus: "For every idle word 
that men speak, they shall give account on the day of judgment." 
For all teachers of a like character to these, who fill men's ears with idle 
talk, shall, when they stand at the throne of judgment, render an account for 
those things which they have vainly imagined and falsely uttered against the 
Lord, proceeding, as they have done, to such a height of audacity as to declare 
of themselves that, on account of the substance of their seed, they are 
acquainted with the spiritual Pleroma, because that man who dwells within 
reveals to them the true Father; for the animal nature required
to be disciplined by means of the senses. But [they hold that] the Demiurge, 
while receiving into himself the whole of this seed, through its being deposited 
in him by the Mother, still remained utterly ignorant of all things, and had no 
understanding of anything connected with the Pleroma. 
3. And that they are the truly "spiritual," inasmuch as a certain particle of 
the Father of the universe has been deposited in their souls, since, according 
to their assertions, they have souls formed of the same substance as the 
Demiurge himself, yet that he, although he received from the Mother, once for 
all, the whole [of the divine] seed, and possessed it in himself, still remained 
of an animal nature, and had not the slightest understanding of those things 
which are above, which things they boast that they themselves understand, while 
they are still on earth;-does not this crown all possible absurdity? For to 
imagine that the very same seed conveyed knowledge and perfection to the souls 
of these men, while it only gave rise to ignorance in the God who made them, is 
an opinion that can be held only by those utterly frantic, and totally destitute 
of common sense.
4. Further, it is also a most absurd and groundless thing for them to say 
that the seed was, by being thus deposited, reduced to form and increased, and 
so was prepared for all the reception of perfect rationality. For there will be 
in it an admixture of matter-that substance which they hold to have been derived 
from ignorance and defect; [and this will prove itself] more apt and useful than 
was the light of their Father, if indeed, when born, according to the 
contemplation of that [light], it was without form or figure, but derived from 
this [matter], form, and appearance, and increase, and perfection. For if that 
light which proceeds from the Pleroma was the cause to a spiritual being that it 
possessed neither form, nor appearance, nor its own special magnitude, while its 
descent to this world added all these things to it, and brought it to 
perfection, then a sojourn here (which they also term darkness) would seem much 
more efficacious and useful than was the light of their Father. But how can it 
be regarded as other than ridiculous, to affirm that their mother ran the risk 
of being almost extinguished in matter, and was almost on the point of being 
destroyed by it, had she not then with difficulty stretched herself outwards, 
and leaped, [as it were, ] out of herself, receiving assistance from the Father; 
but that her seed increased in this same matter, and received a form, and was 
made fit for the reception of perfect rationality; and this, too, while 
"bubbling up" among substances dissimilar and unfamiliar to itself, according to 
their own declaration that the earthly is opposed to the spiritual, and the 
spiritual to the earthly? How, then, could "a little particle," 
as they say, increase, and receive shape, and reach perfection, in the midst of 
substances contrary to and unfamiliar to itself?
5. But further, and in addition to what has been said, the question occurs, 
Did their mother, when she beheld the angels, bring forth the seed all at once, 
or only one by one [in succession]? If she brought forth the whole 
simultaneously and at once, that which was thus produced cannot now be of an 
infantile character: its descent, therefore, into those men who now exist must 
be superfluous.
But if one by one, then she did not form her conception according to the figure 
of those angels whom she beheld; for, contemplating them all together, and once 
for all, so as to conceive by them, she ought to have brought forth once for all 
the offspring of those from whose forms she had once for all conceived.
6. Why was it, too, that, beholding the angels along with the Saviour, she 
did indeed conceive their images, but not that of the Saviour, who 
is far more beautiful than they? Did He not please her; and did she not, on that 
account, conceive after His likeness?
How was it, too, that the Demiurge, whom they can call an animal being, having, 
as they maintain, his own special magnitude and figure, was produced perfect as 
respects his substance; while that which is spiritual, which also ought to be 
more effective than that which is animal, was sent forth imperfect, and he 
required to descend into a soul, that in it he might obtain form, and thus 
becoming perfect, might be rendered fit for the reception of perfect reason? If, 
then, he obtains form in mere earthly and animal men, he can no longer be said 
to be after the likeness of angels whom they call lights, but [after the 
likeness] of those men who are here below. For he will not possess in that case 
the likeness and appearance of angels, but of those souls in whom also he 
receives shape; just as water when poured into a vessel takes the form of that 
vessel, and if on any occasion it happens to congeal in it, it will acquire the 
form of the vessel in which it has thus been frozen, since souls themselves 
possess the figure
of the body [in which they dwell]; for they themselves have been adapted to the 
vessel [in which they exist], as I have said before. If, then, that seed 
[referred to] is here solidified and formed into a definite shape, it will 
possess the figure of a man. and not the form of the angels. How is it possible, 
therefore, that that seed should be after images of the angels, seeing it has 
obtained a form after the likeness of men? Why, again, since it was of a 
spiritual nature, had it any need of descending into flesh? For what is carnal 
stands in need of that which is spiritual, if indeed it is to be saved, that in 
it it may be sanctified and cleared from all impurity, and that what is mortal 
may be swallowed up by immortality;
but that which is spiritual has no need whatever of those things which are here 
below. For it is not we who benefit it, but it that improves us.
7. Still more manifestly is that talk of theirs concerning their seed proved 
to be false, and that in a way which must be evident to every one, by the fact 
that they declare those souls which have received seed from the Mother to be 
superior to all others; wherefore also they have been honoured by the Demiurge, 
and constituted princes, and kings, and priests. For if this were true, the high 
priest Caiaphas, and Annas, and the rest of the chief priests, arid doctors of 
the law, and rulers of the people, would have been the first to believe in the 
Lord, agreeing as they did with respect 
to that relationship; and even before them should have been Herod the king. But 
since neither he, nor the chief priests, nor the rulers, nor the eminent of the 
people, turned to Him [in faith], but, on the contrary, those who sat begging by 
the highway, the deaf, and the blind, while He was rejected and despised by 
others, according to what Paul declares, "For ye see your calling, brethren, 
that there are not many wise men among you, not many noble, not many mighty; but 
those things of the world which were despised hath God chosen." 
Such souls, therefore, were not superior to others on account of the seed 
deposited in them, nor on this account were they honoured by the Demiurge.
8. As to the point, then, that their system is weak and untenable as well as 
utterly chimerical, enough has been said. For it is not needful, to use a common 
proverb, that one should drink up the ocean who wishes to learn that its water 
is salt. But, just as in the case of a statue which is made of clay, but 
coloured on the outside that it may be thought to be of gold, while it really is 
of clay, any one who takes out of it a small particle, and thus laying it open 
reveals the clay, will set free those who seek the truth from a false opinion; 
in the same way have I (by exposing not a small part only, but the several heads 
of their system which are of the greatest importance) shown to as many as do not 
wish wittingly to be led astray, what is wicked, deceitful, seductive, and 
pernicious, connected with the school of the Valentinians, and all those other 
heretics who promulgate 
wicked opinions respecting the Demiurge, that is, the Fashioner and Former of 
this universe, and who is in fact the only true God-exhibiting, [as I have done, 
] how easily their views are overthrown.
9. For who that has any intelligence, and possesses only a small proportion 
of truth, can tolerate them, when they affirm that there is another god above 
the Creator; and that there is another Monogenes as well as another Word of God, 
whom also they describe as having been produced in [a state of] degeneracy; and 
another Christ, whom they assert to have been formed, along with the Holy 
Spirit, later than the rest of the Aeons; and another Saviour, who, they say, 
did not proceed from the Father of all, but was a kind of joint production of 
those Aeons who were formed in [a state of] degeneracy, and that He was produced 
of necessity on account of this very degeneracy? It is thus their opinion that, 
unless the Aeons had been in a state of ignorance and degeneracy, neither 
Christ, nor the Holy Spirit, nor Horos, nor the Saviour, nor the angels, nor 
their Mother, nor her seed, nor the rest of the fabric of the world, would have 
been produced at all; but the universe would have been a desert, and destitute 
of the many good things which exist in it. They are therefore not only 
chargeable with impiety against the Creator, declaring Him the fruit of a 
defect, but also against Christ and the Holy Spirit, affirming that they were 
produced on account of that defect; and, in like manner, that the Saviour [was 
produced] subsequently to [the existence of] that defect. And who will tolerate 
the remainder of their vain talk, which they cunningly endeavour to accommodate 
to the parables, and have in this way plunged both themselves, and those who 
give credit to them, in the profoundest depths of impiety?

Chapter XX.-Futility of the 
  Arguments Adduced to Demonstrate the Sufferings of the Twelfth Aeon, from the 
  Parables, the Treachery of Judas, and the Passion of Our 
Saviour.
1. That they improperly and illogically apply both the parables and the 
actions of the Lord to their falsely-devised system, I prove as follows: They 
endeavour, for instance, to demonstrate that passion which, they say, happened 
in the case of the twelfth Aeon, from this fact, that the passion of the Saviour 
was brought about by the twelfth apostle, and happened in the twelfth month. For 
they hold that He preached [only] for one year after His baptism. They maintain 
also that the same thing was clearly set forth in the case of her who suffered 
from the issue of blood. For the woman suffered during twelve years, and through 
touching the hem of the Saviour's garment she was made whole by that power which 
went forth from the Saviour, and which, they affirm, had a previous existence. 
For that Power who suffered was stretching herself outwards and flowing into 
immensity, so that she was in danger of being dissolved into the general 
substance [of the Aeons]; but then, touching the primary Tetrad, which is 
typified by the hem of the garment, she was arrested, and ceased from her 
passion.
2. Then, again, as to their assertion that the passion of the twelfth Aeon 
was proved through the conduct of Judas, how is it possible that Judas can be 
compared [with this Aeon] as being an emblem of her-he who was expelled from the 
number of the twelve,
and never restored to his place? For that Aeon, whose type they declare Judas to 
be, after being separated from her Enthymesis, was restored or recalled [to her 
former position]; but Judas was deprived [of his office], and cast out, while 
Matthias was ordained in his place, according to what is written, "And his 
bishopric let another take."
They ought therefore to maintain that the twelfth Aeon was cast out of the 
Pleroma, and that another was produced, or sent forth to fill her place; if, 
that is to say, she is pointed at in Judas. Moreover, they tell us that it was 
the Aeon herself who suffered, but Judas was the betrayer, [and not the 
sufferer.] Even they themselves acknowledge that it was the suffering Christ, 
and not Judas, who came to [the endurance of] passion. How, then, could Judas, 
the betrayer of Him who had to suffer for our salvation, be the type and image 
of that Aeon who suffered?
3. But, in truth, the passion of Christ was neither similar to the passion of 
the Aeon, nor did it take place in similar circumstances. For the Aeon underwent 
a passion of dissolution and destruction, so that she who suffered was in danger 
also of being destroyed. But the Lord, our Christ, underwent a valid, and not a 
merely
accidental passion; not only was He Himself not in danger of being destroyed, 
but He also established fallen man
by His own strength, and recalled him to incorruption. The Aeon, again, 
underwent passion while she was seeking after the Father, and was notable to 
find Him; but the Lord suffered that He might bring those who have wandered from 
the Father, back to knowledge and to His fellowship. The search into the 
greatness of the Father became to her a passion leading to destruction; but the 
Lord, having suffered, and bestowing the knowledge of the Father, conferred on 
us salvation. Her passion, as they declare, gave origin to a female offspring, 
weak, infirm, unformed, and ineffective; but His passion gave rise to strength 
and power. For the Lord, through means of suffering, "ascending into the lofty 
place, led captivity captive, gave gifts to men,"
and conferred on those that believe in Him the power "to tread upon serpents and 
scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy,"
that is, of the leader of apostasy. Our Lord also by His passion destroyed 
death, and dispersed error, and put an end to corruption, and destroyed 
ignorance, while He manifested life and revealed truth, and bestowed the gift of 
incorruption. But their Aeon, when she had suffered, established
ignorance, and brought forth a substance without shape, out of which all 
material works have been produced-death, corruption, error, and such like.
4. Judas, then, the twelfth in order of the disciples, was not a type of the 
suffering Aeon, nor, again, was the passion of the Lord; for these two things 
have been shown to be in every respect mutually dissimilar and inharmonious. 
This is the case not only as respects the points which I have already mentioned, 
but with regard to the very number. For that Judas the traitor is the twelfth in 
order, is agreed upon by all, there being twelve apostles mentioned by name in 
the Gospel. But this Aeon is not the twelfth, but the thirtieth; 
for, according to the views under consideration, there were not twelve Aeons 
only produced by the will of the Father, nor was she sent forth the twelfth in 
order: they reckon her, [on the contrary, ] as having been produced in the 
thirtieth place. How, then, can Judas, the twelfth in order, be the type and 
image of that Aeon who occupies the thirtieth place?
5. But if they say that Judas in perishing was the image of her Enthymesis, 
neither in this way will the image bear any analogy to that truth which [by 
hypothesis] corresponds to it. For the Enthymesis having been separated from the 
Aeon, and itself afterwards receiving a shape from Christ,
then being made a partaker of intelligence by the Saviour, and having formed all 
things which are outside of the Pleroma, after the image of those which are 
within the Pleroma, is said at last to have been received by them into the 
Pleroma, and, according to [the principle of] conjunction, to have been united 
to that Saviour who was formed out of all. But Judas having been once for all 
cast away, never returns into the number of the disciples; otherwise a different 
person would not have been chosen to fill his place. Besides, the Lord also 
declared regarding him, "Woe to the man by whom the Son of man shall be 
betrayed; "
and, "It were better for him if he had never been born; "
and he was called the "son of perdition"
by Him. If, however, they say that Judas was a type of the Enthymesis, not as 
separated from the Aeon, but of the passion entwined with her, neither in this 
way can the number twelve be regarded as a [fitting] type of the number three. 
For in the one case Judas was cast away, and Matthias was ordained instead of 
him; but in the other case the Aeon is said to have been in danger of 
dissolution and destruction, and [there are also] her Enthymesis and passion: 
for they markedly distinguish Enthymesis from the passion; and they represent 
the Aeon as being restored, and Enthymesis as acquiring form, but the passion, 
when separated from these, as becoming matter. Since, therefore, there are thus 
these three, the Aeon, her Enthymesis, and her passion, Judas and Matthias, 
being only two, cannot be the types of them.

Chapter XXI.-The Twelve Apostles 
  Were Not a Type of the Aeons.
1. If, again, they maintain that the twelve apostles were a type only of that 
group of twelve Aeons which Anthropos in conjunction with Ecclesia produced, 
then let them produce ten other apostles as a type of those ten remaining Aeons, 
who, as they declare, were produced by Logos and Zoe. For it is unreasonable to 
suppose that the junior, and for that reason inferior Aeons, were set forth by 
the Saviour through the election of the apostles, while their seniors, and on 
this account their superiors, were not thus foreshown; since the Saviour (if, 
that is to say, He chose the apostles with this view, that by means of them He 
might show forth the Aeons who are in the Pleroma) might have chosen other ten 
apostles also, and likewise other eight before these, that thus He might set 
forth the original and primary Ogdoad. He could not,
in regard to the second [Duo] Decad, show forth [any emblem of it] through the 
number of the apostles being [already] constituted a type. For [He made choice 
of no such other number of disciples; but] after the twelve apostles, our Lord 
is found to have sent seventy others before Him.
Now seventy cannot possibly be the type either of an Ogdoad, a Decad, or 
a Triacontad. What is the reason, then, that the inferior Aeons are, as I have 
said, represented by means of the apostles; but the superior, from whom, too, 
the former derived their being, are not prefigured at all? But if
the twelve apostles were chosen with this object, that the number of the twelve 
Aeons might be indicated by means of them, then the seventy also ought to have 
been chosen to be the type of seventy Aeons; and in that case, they must affirm 
that the Aeons are no longer thirty, but eighty-two in number. For He who made 
choice of the apostles, that they might be a type of those Aeons existing in the 
Pleroma, would never have constituted them types of some and not of others; but 
by means of the apostles He would have tried to preserve an image and to exhibit 
a type of those Aeons that exist in the Pleroma.
2. Moreover we must not keep silence respecting Paul, but demand from them 
after the type of what Aeon that apostle has been handed down to us, unless 
perchance [they affirm that he is a representative] of the Saviour compounded of 
them [all], who derived his being from the collected gifts of the whole, and 
whom they term All Things, as having been formed out of them all. 
Respecting this being the poet Hesiod has strikingly expressed himself, styling 
him Pandora-that is, "The gift of all"-for this reason, that the best gift in 
the possession of all was centred in him. In describing these gifts the 
following account is given: Hermes (so
he is called in the Greek language), Ai9muli/ou;
te lo/gouj kai\ e0pi/klopon h\qoj au0tou=j Ka/tqeto 
(or to express this in the English
language), "implanted words of fraud and deceit in their minds, and thievish 
habits," for the purpose of leading foolish men astray, that such should believe 
their falsehoods. For their Mother-that is, Leto
-secretly stirred them up (whence also she is called Leto,
according to the meaning of the Greek word, because she secretly stirred up 
men), without the knowledge of the Demiurge, to give forth profound and 
unspeakable mysteries to itching ears. 
And not only did their Mother bring it about that this mystery should be 
declared by Hesiod; but very skilfully also by means of the lyric poet Pindar, 
when he describes to the Demiurge 
the case of Pelops, whose flesh was cut in pieces by the Father, and then 
collected and brought together, and compacted anew by all the gods, 
did she in this way indicate Pandora and these men having their consciences 
seared by her, declaring, as they maintain, the very same things, are [proved] of the 
same family and spirit as the others.

Chapter XXII.-The Thirty Aeons are 
  Not Typified by the Fact that Christ Was Baptized in His Thirtieth Year: He 
  Did Not Suffer in the Twelfth Month After His Baptism, But Was More Than Fifty 
  Years Old When He Died.
1. I have shown that the number thirty fails them in every respect; 
too few Aeons, as they represent them, being at one time found within the 
Pleroma, and then again too many [to correspond with that number]. There are 
not, therefore, thirty Aeons, nor did the Saviour come to be baptized when He 
was thirty years old, for this reason, that He might show forth the thirty 
silent Aeons of their system, otherwise they must first of all separate and eject [the 
Saviour] Himself from the Pleroma of all. Moreover, they affirm that He suffered 
in the twelfth month, so that He continued to preach for one year after His 
baptism; and they endeavour to establish this point out of the prophet (for it 
is written, "To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of 
retribution"), being truly blind, inasmuch as they affirm they have found out the mysteries 
of Bythus, yet not understanding that which is called by Isaiah the acceptable 
year of the Lord, nor the day of retribution. For the prophet neither speaks 
concerning a day which includes the space of twelve hours, nor of a year the 
length of which is twelve months. For even they themselves acknowledge that the 
prophets have very often expressed themselves in parables and allegories, and 
[are] not [to be understood] according to the mere sound of the words.
2. That, then, was called the day of retribution on which the Lord will 
render to every one according to his works-that is, the judgment. The acceptable 
year of the Lord, again, is this present time, in which those who believe Him 
are called by Him, and become acceptable to God-that is, the whole time from His 
advent onwards to the consummation [of all things], during which He acquires to 
Himself as fruits [of the scheme of mercy] those who are saved. For, according 
to the phraseology of the prophet, the day of retribution follows the 
[acceptable] year; and the prophet will be proved guilty of falsehood if the 
Lord preached only for a year, and if he speaks of it. For where is the day of 
retribution? For the year has passed, and the day of retribution has not yet 
come; but He still "makes His sun to rise upon the good and upon the evil, and 
sends rain upon the just and unjust."
And the righteous suffer persecution, are afflicted, and are slain, while 
sinners are possessed of abundance, and "drink with the sound of the harp and 
psaltery, but do not regard the works of the Lord."
But, according to the language [used by the prophet], they ought to be combined, 
and the day of retribution to follow the [acceptable] year. For the words are, 
"to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of retribution." This 
present time, therefore, in which men are called and saved by the Lord, is 
properly understood to be denoted by "the acceptable year of the Lord; "and 
there follows on this "the day of retribution," that is, the judgment. And the 
time thus referred to is not called "a year" only, but is also named "a day" 
both by the prophet and by Paul, of whom the apostle, calling to mind the 
Scripture, says in the Epistle addressed to the Romans, "As it is written, for 
thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are counted as sheep for the 
slaughter."
But here the expression "all the day long" is put for all this time during which 
we suffer persecution, and are killed as sheep. As then this day does not 
signify one which consists of twelve hours, but the whole time during which 
believers in Christ suffer and are put to death for His sake, so also the 
year there mentioned does not denote one which consists of twelve months, 
but the whole time of faith during which men hear and believe the preaching of 
the Gospel, and those become acceptable to God who unite themselves to Him.
3. But it is greatly to be wondered at, how it has come to pass that, while 
affirming that they have found out the mysteries of God, they have not examined 
the Gospels to ascertain how often after His baptism the Lord went up, at the 
time of the passover, to Jerusalem, in accordance with what was the practice of 
the Jews from every land, and every year, that they should assemble at this 
period in Jerusalem, and there celebrate the feast of the passover. First of 
all, after He had made the water wine at Cana of Galilee, He went up to the 
festival day of the passover, on which occasion it is written, "For many 
believed in Him, when they saw the signs which He did," 
as John the disciple of the Lord records. Then, again, withdrawing Himself [from 
Judaea], He is found in Samaria; on which occasion, too, He convened with the 
Samaritan woman, and while at a distance, cured the son of the centurion by a 
word, saying, "Go thy way, thy son liveth." 
Afterwards He went up, the second time, to observe the festival day of the 
passover 
in Jerusalem; on which occasion He cured the paralytic man, who had lain beside 
the pool thirty-eight years, bidding him rise, take up his couch, and depart. 
Again, withdrawing from thence to the other side of the sea of Tiberias,
He there seeing a great crowd had followed Him, fed all that multitude with five 
loaves of bread, and twelve baskets of fragments remained over and above. Then, 
when He had raised Lazarus from the dead, and plots were formed against Him by 
the Pharisees, He withdrew to a city called Ephraim; and from that place, as it 
is written "He came to Bethany six days before the passover," 
and going up from Bethany to Jerusalem, He there ate the passover, and suffered 
on the day following. Now, that these three occasions of the passover are not 
included within one year, every person whatever must acknowledge. And that the 
special month in which the passover was celebrated, and in which also the Lord 
suffered, was not the twelfth, but the first, those men who boast that they know 
all things, if they know not this, may learn it from Moses. Their explanation, 
therefore, both of the year and of the twelfth month has been proved false, and 
they ought to reject either their explanation or the Gospel; otherwise [this 
unanswerable question forces itself upon them], How is it possible that the Lord 
preached for one year only?
4. Being thirty years old when He came to be baptized, and then possessing 
the full age of a Master,
He came to Jerusalem, so that He might be properly acknowledged 
by all as a Master. For He did not seem one thing while He was another, as those 
affirm who describe Him as being man only in appearance; but what He was, that 
He also appeared to be. Being a Master, therefore, He also possessed the age of 
a Master, not despising or evading any condition of humanity, nor setting aside 
in Himself that law which He had
appointed for the human race, but sanctifying every age, by that period 
corresponding to it which belonged to Himself. For He came to save all through 
means of Himself-all, I say, who through Him are born again to God
-infants,
and children, and boys, and youths, and old men. He therefore passed through 
every age, becoming an infant for infants, thus sanctifying infants; a child for 
children, thus sanctifying those who are of this age, being at the same time 
made to them an example of piety, righteousness, and submission; a youth for 
youths, becoming an example to youths, and thus sanctifying them for the Lord. 
So likewise He was an old man for old men, that He might be a perfect Master for 
all, not merely as respects the setting forth of the truth, but also as regards 
age, sanctifying at the same time the aged also, and becoming an example to them 
likewise. Then, at last, He came on to death itself, that He might be "the 
first-born from the dead, that in all things He might have the 
pre-eminence," 
the Prince of life, 
existing before all, and going before all.

5. They, however, that they may establish their false opinion regarding that 
which is written, "to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord," maintain that 
He preached for one year only, and then suffered in the twelfth month. [In 
speaking thus], they are forgetful to their own disadvantage, destroying His 
whole work, and robbing Him of that age which is both more necessary and more 
honourable than any other; that more advanced age, I mean, during which also as 
a teacher He excelled all others. For how could He have had disciples, if He did 
not teach? And how could He have taught, unless He had reached the age of a 
Master? For when He came to be baptized, He had not yet completed His thirtieth 
year, but was beginning to be about thirty years of age (for thus Luke, who has 
mentioned His years, has expressed it: "Now Jesus was, as it were, beginning to 
be thirty years old,"
when He came to receive baptism); and, [according to these men, ] He preached 
only one year reckoning from His baptism. On completing His thirtieth year He 
suffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means attained to 
advanced age. Now, that the first stage of early life embraces thirty 
years,
and that this extends onwards to the fortieth year, every one will admit; but 
from the fortieth andfiftieth year a man begins to decline towards old age, 
which our Lord possessed while He still fulfilled the office of a Teacher, even 
as the Gospel and all the elders testify; those who were conversant in Asia with 
John, the disciple of the Lord, [affirming] that John conveyed to them that 
information.
And he remained among them up to the times of Trajan. 
Some of them, moreover, saw not only John, but the other apostles also, and 
heard the very same account from them, and bear testimony as to the [validity 
of] the statement. Whom then should we rather believe? Whether such men as 
these, or Ptolemaeus, who never saw the apostles, and who never even in his 
dreams attained to the slightest trace of an apostle?
6. But, besides this, those very Jews who then disputed with the Lord Jesus 
Christ have most clearly indicated the same thing. For when the Lord said to 
them, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day; and he saw it, and was glad," 
they answered Him, "Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast Thou seen 
Abraham? "
Now, such language is fittingly applied to one who has already passed the age of 
forty, without having as yet reached his fiftieth year, yet is not far from this 
latter period. But to one who is only thirty years old it would unquestionably 
be said, "Thou art not yet forty years old." For those who wished to convict Him 
of falsehood would certainly not extend the number of His years far beyond the 
age which they saw He had attained; but they mentioned a period near His real 
age, whether they had truly ascertained this out of the entry in the public 
register, or simply made a conjecture from what they observed that He was above 
forty years old, and that He certainly was not one of only thirty years of 
age.For it is altogether unreasonable to suppose that they were mistaken by 
twenty years, when they wished to prove Him younger than the times of Abraham. 
For what they saw, that they also expressed; and He whom they beheld was not a 
mere phantasm, but an actual being 
of flesh and blood. He did not then wont much of being fifty years old; 
and, in accordance with that fact, they said to Him, "Thou art not yet fifty 
years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham? "He did not therefore preach only for one 
year, nor did He suffer in the twelfth month of the year. For the period 
included between the thirtieth and the fiftieth year can never be regarded as 
one year, unless indeed, among their Aeons, there be so long years 
assigned to those who sit in their ranks with Bythus in the Pleroma; of which 
beings Homer the poet, too, has spoken, doubtless being inspired by the Mother 
of their [system of] error:-


Oi9 de\ qeoi\ pu\ r Zeni\ kaqh=menoi 
    h0goro/wnto
Xruse/w| e0n dape/dw|:
    
which we may thus render into English:
-"The gods sat round, while Jove presided o'er, And converse held upon the 
golden floor."

Chapter XXIII.-The Woman Who 
  Suffered from an Issue of Blood Was No Type of the Suffering 
Aeon.
1. Moreover, their ignorance comes out in a clear light with respect to the 
case of that woman who, suffering from an issue of blood, touched the hem of the 
Lord's garment, and so was made whole; for they maintain that through her was 
shown forth that twelfth power who suffered passion, and flowed out towards 
immensity, that is, the twelfth Aeon. [This ignorance of theirs appears] first, 
because, as I have shown, according to their own system, that was not the 
twelfth Aeon. But even granting them this point [in the meantime], there being 
twelve Aeons, eleven of these are said to have continued impassible, while the 
twelfth suffered passion; but the woman, on the other hand, being healed in the 
twelfth year, it is manifest that she had continued to suffer during eleven 
years, and was healed in the twelfth. If indeed they were to say that eleven 
Aeons were involved in passion, but the twelfth one was healed, it would then be 
a plausible thing to say that the woman was a type of these. But since she 
suffered during eleven years, and [all that time] obtained no cure, but was 
healed in the twelfth year, in what way can she be a type of the twelfth of the 
Aeons, eleven of whom, [according to hypothesis, ] did not suffer at all, but 
the twelfth alone participated in suffering? For a type and emblem is, no doubt, 
sometimes diverse from the truth [signified] as to matter and substance; but it 
ought, as to the general form and features, to maintain a likeness [to what is 
typified], and in this way to shadow forth by means of things present those 
which are yet to come.
2. And not only in the case of this woman have the years of her infirmity 
(which they affirm to fit in with their figment) been mentioned, but, lo! 
another woman was also healed, after suffering in like manner for eighteen 
years; concerning whom the Lord said, "And ought not this daughter of Abraham, 
whom Satan has bound during eighteen years, to be set free on the Sabbath-day? 
"If, then, the former was a type of the twelfth Aeon that suffered, the latter 
should also be a type of the eighteenth Aeon in suffering. But they cannot 
maintain this; otherwise their primary and original Ogdoad will be included in 
the number of Aeons who suffered together. Moreover, there was also a certain 
other person
healed by the Lord, after he had suffered for eight-and-thirty years: they ought 
therefore to affirm that the Aeon who occupies the thirty-eighth place suffered. 
For if they assert that the things which were done by the Lord were types of 
what took place in the Pleroma, the type ought to be preserved throughout. But 
they can neither adapt to their fictitious system the case of her who was cured 
after eighteen years, nor of him who was cured after thirty-eight years. Now, it 
is in every way absurd and inconsistent to declare that the Saviour preserved 
the type in certain cases, while He did not do so in others. The type of the 
woman, therefore, [with the issue of blood] is shown to have no analogy to their 
system of Aeons.


Chapter XXIV.-Folly of the Arguments 
  Derived by the Heretics from Numbers, Letters, and Syllables.
1. This very thing, too, still further demonstrates their opinion false, and 
their fictitious system untenable, that they endeavour to bring forward proofs 
of it, sometimes through means of numbers and the syllables of names, sometimes 
also through the letter of syllables, and yet again through those numbers which 
are, according to the practice followed by the Greeks, contained in [different] 
letters;-[this, I say, ] demonstrates in the clearest manner their overthrow or 
confusion,
as well as the untenable and perverse character of their [professed] knowledge. 
For, transferring the name Jesus, which belongs to another language, to 
the numeration of the Greeks, they sometimes call it "Episemon,"
as having six letters, and at other times "the Plenitude of the Ogdoads," as 
containing the number eight hundred and eighty-eight. But His [corresponding] 
Greek name, which is "Soter," that is, Saviour, because it does not fit 
in with their system, either with respect to numerical value or as regards its 
letters, they pass over in silence. Yet surely, if they regard the names of the 
Lord, as, in accordance with the preconceived purpose of the Father, by means of 
their numerical value and letters, indicating number in the Pleroma, 
Soter, as being a Greek name, ought by means of its letters and the 
numbers [expressed by these], in virtue of its being Greek, to show forth the 
mystery of the Pleroma. But the case is not so, because it is a word of five 
letters, and its numerical value is one thousand four hundred and eight.
But these things do not in any way correspond with their Pleroma; the account, 
therefore, which they give of transactions in the Pleroma cannot be true.
2. Moreover, Jesus, which is a word belonging to the proper tongue of 
the Hebrews, contains, as the learned among them declare, two letters and a 
half,
and signifies that Lord who contains heaven and earth;
for Jesus in the ancient Hebrew language means "heaven," while again 
"earth" is expressed by the words sura usser.
The word, therefore, which contains heaven and earth is just Jesus. Their 
explanation, then, of the Episemon is false, and their numerical 
calculation is also manifestly overthrown. For, in their own language, 
Soter is a Greek word of five letters; but, on the other hand, in the 
Hebrew tongue, Jesus contains only two letters and a half. The total 
which they reckon up, viz., eight hundred and eighty-eight, therefore falls to 
the ground. And throughout, the Hebrew letters do not correspond in number with 
the Greek, although these especially, as being the more ancient and unchanging, 
ought to uphold the reckoning connected with the names. For these ancient, 
original, and generally called sacred letters
of the Hebrews are ten in number (but they are written by means of 
fifteen
), the last letter being joined to the first. And thus they write some of these 
letters according to their natural sequence, just as we do, but others in a 
reverse direction, from the right hand towards the left, thus tracing the 
letters backwards. The name Christ, too, ought to be capable of being 
reckoned up in harmony with the Aeons of their Pleroma, inasmuch as, according 
to their statements, He was produced for the establishment and rectification of 
their Pleroma. The Father, too, in the same way, ought, both by means of letters 
and numerical value, to contain the number of those Aeons who were produced by 
Him; Bythus, in like manner, and not less Monogenes; but pre-eminently the name 
which is above all others, by which God is called, and which in the Hebrew 
tongue is expressed by Baruch,
[a word] which also contains two and a half letters. From this fact, therefore, 
that the more important names, both in the Hebrew and Greek languages, do not 
conform to their system, either as respects the number of letters or the 
reckoning brought out of them, the forced character of their calculations 
respecting the rest becomes clearly manifest.
3. For, choosing out of the law whatever things agree with the number adopted 
in their system, they thus violently strive to obtain proofs of its validity. 
But if it was really the purpose of their Mother, or the Saviour, to set forth, 
by means of the Demiurge, types of those things which are in the Pleroma, they 
should have taken care that the types were found in things more exactly 
correspondent and more holy; and, above all, in the case of the Ark of the 
Covenant, on account of which the whole tabernacle of witness was formed. Now it 
was constructed thus: its length
was two cubits and a half, its breadth one cubit and a half, its height one 
cubit and a half; but such a number of cubits in no respect corresponds with 
their system, yet by it the type ought to have been, beyond everything else, 
clearly set forth. The mercy-seat 
also does in like manner not at all harmonize with their expositions. Moreover, 
the table of shew-bread
was two cubits in length, while its height was a cubit and a half. These stood 
before the holy of holies, and yet in them not a single number is of such an 
amount as contains an indication of the Tetrad, or the Ogdoad, or of the rest of 
their Pleroma. What of the candlestick,
too, which had seven
branches and seven lamps? while, if these had been made according to the type, 
it ought to have had eight branches and a like number of lamps, after the type 
of the primary Ogdoad, which shines pre-eminently among the Aeons, and 
illuminates the whole Pleroma. They have carefully enumerated the 
curtains 
as being ten, declaring these a type of the ten Aeons; but they have forgotten 
to count the coverings of skin, which were eleven
in number. Nor, again, have they measured the size of these very curtains, each 
curtain
being eight-and-twenty cubits in length. And they set forth the length of the 
pillars as being ten cubits, with a reference to the Decad of Aeons. "But the 
breadth of each pillar was a cubit and a half; "
and this they do not explain, any more than they do the entire number of the 
pillars or of their bars, because that does not suit the argument. But what of 
the anointing oil,
which sanctified the whole tabernacle? Perhaps it escaped the notice of the 
Saviour, or, while their Mother was sleeping, the Demiurge of himself gave 
instructions as to its weight; and on this account it is out of harmony with 
their Pleroma, consisting,
as it did, of five hundred shekels of myrrh, five hundred of cassia, two hundred 
and fifty of cinnamon, two hundred and fifty of calamus, and oil in addition, so 
that it was composed of five ingredients. The incense
also, in like manner, [was compounded] of stacte, onycha, galbanum, mint, and 
frankincense, all which do in no respect, either as to their mixture or weight, 
harmonize with their argument. It is therefore unreasonable and altogether 
absurd [to maintain] that the types were not preserved in the sublime and more 
imposing enactments of the law; but in other points, when any number coincides 
with their assertions, to affirm that it was a type of the things in the 
Pleroma; while [the truth is, that] every number occurs with the utmost variety 
in the Scriptures, so that, should any one desire it, he might form not only an 
Ogdoad, and a Decad, and a Duodecad, but any sort of number from the Scriptures, 
and then maintain that this was a type of the system of error devised by 
himself.
4. But that this point is true, that that number which is called five, 
which agrees in no respect with their argument, and does not harmonize with 
their system, nor is suitable for a typical manifestation of the things in the 
Pleroma, [yet has a wide prevalence,
] will be proved as follows from the Scriptures. Soter is a name of five 
letters; Pater, too, contains five letters; Agape (love), too, consists 
of five letters; and our Lord, after
blessing the five loaves, fed with them five thousand men. Five virgins 
were called wise by the Lord; and, in like manner, five were styled foolish. 
Again, five men are said to have been with the Lord when He obtained 
testimony
from the Father,-namely, Peter, and James, and John, and Moses, and Elias. The 
Lord also, as the fifth person, entered into the apartment of the dead maiden, 
and raised her up again; for, says [the Scripture], "He suffered no man to go 
in, save Peter and James,
and the father and mother of the maiden."
The rich man in hell 
declared that he had five brothers, to whom he desired that one rising from the 
dead should go. The pool from which the Lord commanded the paralytic man to go 
into his house, had five porches. The very form of the cross, too, has five 
extremities,
two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person 
rests who is fixed by the nails. Each of our hands has five fingers; we have 
also five senses; our internal organs may also be reckoned as five, viz., the 
heart, the liver, the lungs, the spleen, and the kidneys. Moreover, even the 
whole person may be divided into this number [of parts],-the head, the breast, 
the belly, the thighs, and the feet. The human race passes through five ages 
first infancy, then boyhood, then youth, then maturity, 
and then old age. Moses delivered the law to the people in five books. Each 
table which he received from God contained five
commandments. The veil covering
the holy of holies had five pillars. The altar of burnt-offering also was five 
cubits in breadth.
Five priests were chosen in the wilderness,-namely, Aaron,
Nadab, Abiud, Eleazar, Ithamar. The ephod and the breastplate, and other 
sacerdotal vestments, were formed out of five
materials; for they combined in themselves gold, and blue, and purple, and 
scarlet, and fine linen. And there were five
kings of the Amorites, whom Joshua the son of Nun shut up in a cave, and 
directed the people to trample upon their heads. Any one, in fact, might collect 
many thousand other things of the same kind, both with respect to this number 
and any other he chose to fix upon, either from the Scriptures, or from the 
works of nature lying under his observation.
But although such is the case, we do not therefore affirm that there are five 
Aeons above the Demiurge; nor do we consecrate the Peptad, as if it were some 
divine thing; nor do we strive to establish things that are untenable, nor 
ravings [such as they indulge in], by means of that vain kind of labour; nor do 
we perversely force a creation well adapted by God [for the ends intended to be 
served], to change itself into types of things which have no real existence; nor 
do we seek to bring forward impious and abominable doctrines, the detection and 
overthrow of which are easy to all possessed of intelligence.
5. For who can concede to them that the year has three hundred and sixty-five 
days only, in order that there may be twelve months of thirty days each, after 
the type of the twelve Aeons, when the type is in fact altogether out of harmony 
[with the antitype]? For, in the one case, each of the Aeons is a thirtieth part 
of the entire Pleroma, while in the other they declare that a month is the 
twelfth part of a year. If, indeed, the year were divided into thirty parts, and 
the month into twelve, then a fitting type might be regarded as having been 
found for their fictitious system. But, on the contrary, as the case really 
stands, their Pleroma is divided into thirty parts, and a portion of it into 
twelve; while again the whole year is divided into twelve parts, and a certain 
portion of it into thirty. The Saviour therefore acted unwisely in constituting 
the month a type of the entire Pleroma, but the year a type only of that 
Duodecad which exists in the Pleroma; for it was more fitting to divide the year 
into thirty parts, even as the whole Pleroma is divided, but the month into 
twelve, just as the Aeons are in their Pleroma. Moreover, they divide the entire 
Pleroma into three portions,-namely, into an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a Duodecad. 
But our year is divided into four parts,-namely, spring, summer, autumn, and 
winter. And again, not even do the months, which they maintain to be a type of 
the Triacontad, consist precisely of thirty days, but some have more and some 
less, inasmuch as five days remain to them as an overplus.
The day, too, does not always consist precisely of twelve hours, but rises from 
nine to fifteen, and then falls again from fifteen to nine. It cannot therefore be 
held that months of thirty days each were so formed for the sake of [typifying] 
the Aeons; for, in that case, they would have consisted precisely of thirty 
days: nor, again, the days of these months, that by means of twelve hours they 
might symbolize the twelve Aeons; for, in that case, they would always have 
consisted precisely of twelve hours.
6. But further, as to their calling material substances "on the left hand," 
and maintaining that those things which are thus on the left hand of necessity 
fall into corruption, while they also affirm that the Saviour came to the lost 
sheep, in order to transfer it to the right hand, that is, to the ninety and 
nine sheep which were in safety, and perished not, but continued within the 
fold, yet were of the left hand,
it follows that they must acknowledge that the enjoyment
of rest did not imply salvation. And that which has not in like manner the same 
number, they will be compelled to acknowledge as belonging to the left hand, 
that is, to corruption. This Greek word Agape (love), then, according to the 
letters of the Greeks, by means of which reckoning is carried on among them, 
having a numerical value of ninety-three,
is in like manner assigned to the place of rest on the left hand. Aletheia 
(truth), too, having in like manner, according to the principle indicated above, 
a numerical value of sixty-four,
exists among material substances. And thus, in fine, they will be compelled to 
acknowledge that all those sacred names which do not reach a numerical value of 
one hundred, but only contain the numbers summed by the left hand, are 
corruptible and material.

Chapter XXV.-God is Not to Be Sought 
  After by Means of Letters, Syllables, and Numbers; Necessity of Humility in 
  Such Investigations.
1. If any one, however, say in reply to these things, What then? Is it a 
meaningless and accidental thing, that the positions of names, and the election 
of the apostles, and the working of the Lord, and the arrangement of created 
things, are what they are?-we answer them: Certainly not; but with great wisdom 
and diligence, all things have clearly been made by God, fitted and prepared 
[for their special purposes]; and His word formed both things ancient and those 
belonging to the latest times; and men ought not to connect those things with 
the number thirty,
but to harmonize them with what actually exists, or with fight reason. Nor 
should they seek to prosecute inquiries respecting God by means of numbers, 
syllables, and letters. For this is an uncertain mode of proceeding, on account 
of their varied and diverse systems, and because every sort of hypothesis may at 
the present day be, in like manner, devised
by any one; so that
they can derive arguments against the truth from these very theories, inasmuch 
as they may be turned in many different directions. But, on the contrary, they 
ought to adapt the numbers themselves, and those things which have been formed, 
to the true theory lying before them. For system
does not spring out of numbers, but numbers from a system; nor does God derive 
His being from things made, but things made from God. For all things originate 
from one and the same God.
2. But since created things are various and numerous, they are indeed well 
fitted and adapted to the whole creation; yet, when viewed individually, are 
mutually opposite and inharmonious, just as the sound of the lyre, which 
consists of many and opposite notes, gives rise to one unbroken melody, through 
means of the interval which separates each one from the others. The lover of 
truth therefore ought not to be deceived by the interval between each note, nor 
should he imagine that one was due to one artist and author, and another to 
another, nor that one person fitted the treble, another the bass, and yet 
another the tenor strings; but he should hold that one and the same person 
[formed the whole], so as to prove the judgment, goodness, and skill exhibited 
in the whole work and [specimen of] wisdom. Those, too, who listen to the 
melody, ought to praise and extol the artist, to admire the tension of some 
notes, to attend to the softness of others, to catch the sound of others between 
both these extremes, and to consider the special character of others, so as to 
inquire at what each one aims, and what is the cause of their variety, never 
failing to apply our rule, neither giving up the [one
] artist, nor casting off faith in the one God who formed all things, nor 
blaspheming our Creator.
3. If, however, any one do not discover the cause of all those things which 
become objects of investigation, let him reflect that man is infinitely inferior 
to God; that he has received grace only in part, and is not yet equal or similar 
to his Maker; and, moreover, that he cannot have experience or form a conception 
of all things like God; but in the same proportion as he who was formed but 
to-day, and received the beginning of his creation, is inferior to Him who is 
uncreated, and who is always the same, in that proportion is he, as respects 
knowledge and the faculity of investigating the causes of all things, inferior 
to Him who made him. For thou, O man, art not an uncreated being, nor didst thou 
always co-exist
with God, as did His own Word; but now, through His pre-eminent goodness, 
receiving the beginning of thy creation, thou dost gradually learn from the Word 
the dispensations of God who made thee.
4. Preserve therefore the proper order of thy knowledge, and do not, as being 
ignorant of things really good, seek to rise above God Himself, for He cannot be 
surpassed; nor do thou seek after any one above the Creator, for thou wilt not 
discover such, For thy Former cannot be contained within limits; nor, although 
thou shouldst measure all this [universe], and pass through all His creation, 
and consider it in all its depth, and height, and length, wouldst thou be able 
to conceive of any other above the Father Himself. For thou wilt not be able to 
think Him fully out, but, indulging in trains of reflection opposed to thy 
nature, thou wilt prove thyself foolish; and if thou persevere in such a course, 
thou wilt fall into utter madness, whilst thou deemest thyself loftier and 
greater than thy Creator, and imaginest that thou canst penetrate beyond His 
dominions.

Chapter XXVI.-"Knowledge Puffeth Up, 
  But Love Edifieth."
1. It is therefore better and more profitable to belong to the simple and 
unlettered class, and by means of love to attain to nearness to God, than, by 
imagining ourselves learned and skilful, to be found [among those who are] 
blasphemous against their own God, inasmuch as they conjure up another God as 
the Father. And for this reason Paul exclaimed, "Knowledge puffeth up, but love 
edifieth: "not that he meant to inveigh against a true knowledge of God, for in that case 
he would have accused himself; but, because he knew that some, puffed up by the 
pretence of knowledge, fall away from the love of God, and imagine that they 
themselves are perfect, for this reason that they set forth an imperfect 
Creator, with the view of putting an end to the pride which they feel on account 
of knowledge of this kind, he says, "Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth." 
Now there can be no greater conceit than this, that any one should imagine he is 
better and more perfect than He who made and fashioned him, and imparted to him 
the breath of life, and commanded this very thing into existence. It is 
therefore better, as I have said, that one should have no knowledge whatever of 
any one reason why a single thing in creation has been made, but should believe 
in God, and continue in His love, than 
that, puffed up through knowledge of this kind, he should fall away from that 
love which is the life of man; and that he should search after no other 
knowledge except [the knowledge of] Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was 
crucified for us, than that by subtle questions and hair-splitting expressions 
he should fall into impiety.

2. For how would it be, if any one, gradually elated by attempts of the kind 
referred to, should, because the Lord said that "even the hairs of your head are 
all numbered,"
set about inquiring into the number of hairs on each one's head, and endeavour 
to search out the reason on account of which one man has so many, and another so 
many, since all have not an equal number, but many thousands upon thousands are 
to be found with still varying numbers, on this account that some have larger 
and others smaller heads, some have bushy heads of hair, others thin, and others 
scarcely any hair at all,-and then those who imagine that they have discovered 
the number of the hairs, should endeavour to apply that for the commendation of 
their own sect which they have conceived? Or again, if any one should, because 
of this expression which occurs in the Gospel, "Are not two sparrows sold for a 
farthing? and not one of them falls to the ground without the will of your 
Father,"
take occasion to reckon up the number of sparrows caught daily, whether over all 
the world or in some particular district, and to make inquiry as to the reason 
of so many having been captured yesterday, so many the day before, and so many 
again on this day, and should then join on the number of sparrows to his 
[particular] hypothesis, would he not in that case mislead himself altogether, 
and drive into absolute insanity those that agreed with him, since men are 
always eager in such matters to be thought to have discovered something more 
extraordinary than their masters? 

3. But if any one should ask us whether every number of all the things which 
have been made, and which are made, is known to God, and whether every one of 
these [numbers] has, according to His providence, received that special amount 
which it contains; and on our agreeing that such is the case, and acknowledging 
that not one of the things which have been, or are, or shall be made, escapes 
the knowledge of God, but that through His providence every one of them has 
obtained its nature, and rank, and number, and special quantity, and that 
nothing whatever either has been or is produced in vain or accidentally, but 
with exceeding suitability [to the purpose intended], and in the exercise of 
transcendent knowledge, and that it was an admirable and truly divine 
intellect
which could both distinguish and bring forth the proper causes of such a system: 
if, [I say, ] any one, on obtaining our adherence and consent to this, should 
proceed to reckon up the sand and pebbles of the earth, yea also the waves of 
the sea and the stars of heaven, and should endeavour to think out the causes of 
the number which he imagines himself to have discovered, would not his labour be 
in vain, and would not such a man be justly declared mad, and destitute of 
reason, by all possessed of common sense? And the more he occupied himself 
beyond others in questions of this kind, and the more he imagines himself to 
find out beyond others, styling them unskilful, ignorant, and animal beings, 
because they do not enter into his so useless labour, the more is he [in 
reality] insane, foolish, struck as it were with a thunderbolt, since indeed he 
does in no one point own himself inferior to God; but, by the knowledge which he 
imagines himself to have discovered, he changes God Himself, and exalts his own 
opinion above the greatness of the Creator.

Chapter XXVII.-Proper Mode of 
  Interpreting Parables and Obscure Passages of Scripture.
1. A sound mind, and one which does not expose its possessor to danger, and 
is devoted to piety and the love of truth, will eagerly meditate upon those 
things which God has placed within the power of mankind, and has subjected to 
our knowledge, and will make advancement in [acquaintance with] them, rendering 
the knowledge of them easy to him by means of daily study. These things are such 
as fall [plainly] under our observation, and are clearly and unambiguously in 
express terms set forth in the Sacred Scriptures. And therefore the parables 
ought not to be adapted to ambiguous expressions. For, if this be not done, both 
he who explains them will do so without danger, and the parables will receive a 
like interpretation from all, and the body
of truth remains entire, with a harmonious adaptation of its members, and 
without any collision [of its several parts]. But to apply expressions which are 
not clear or evident to interpretations of the parables, such as every one 
discovers for himself as inclination leads him, [is absurd.
] For in this way no one will possess the rule of truth; but in accordance with 
the number of persons who explain the parables will be found the various systems 
of truth, in mutual opposition to each other, and setting forth antagonistic 
doctrines, like the questions current among the Gentile philosophers.
2. According to this course of procedure, therefore, man would always be 
inquiring but never finding, because he has rejected the very method of 
discovery. And when the Bridegroom
comes, he who has his lamp untrimmed, and not burning with the brightness of a 
steady light, is classed among those who obscure the interpretations of the 
parables, forsaking Him who by His plain announcements freely imparts gifts to 
all who come to Him, and is excluded from His marriage-chamber. Since, 
therefore, the entire Scriptures, the prophets, and the Gospels, can be clearly, 
unambiguously, and harmoniously understood by all, although all do not believe 
them; and
since they proclaim that one only God, to the exclusion of all others, formed 
all things by His word, whether visible or invisible, heavenly or earthly, in 
the water or under the earth, as I have shown
from the very words of Scripture; and since the very system of creation to which 
we belong testifies, by what falls under our notice, that one Being made and 
governs it,-those persons will seem truly foolish who blind their eyes to such a 
clear demonstration, and will not behold the light of the announcement [made to 
them]; but they put fetters upon themselves, and every one of them imagines, by 
means of their obscure interpretations of the parables, that he has found out a 
God of his own. For that there is nothing whatever openly, expressly, and 
without controversy said in any part of Scripture respecting the Father 
conceived of by those who hold a contrary opinion, they themselves testify, when 
they maintain that the Saviour privately taught these same things not to all, 
but to certain only of His disciples who could comprehend them, and who 
understood what was intended by Him through means of arguments, enigmas, and 
parables. They come, [in fine, ] to this, that they maintain there is one Being 
who is proclaimed as God, and another as Father, He who is set forth as such 
through means of parables and enigmas. 
3. But since parables admit of many interpretations, what lover of truth will 
not acknowledge, that for them to assert God is to be searched out from these, 
while they desert what is certain, indubitable, and true, is the part of men who 
eagerly throw themselves into danger, and act as if destitute of reason? And is 
not such a course of conduct not to build one's house upon a rock 
which is firm, strong, and placed in an open position, but upon the shifting 
sand? Hence the overthrow of such a building is a matter of ease.

Chapter XXVIII.-Perfect Knowledge 
  Cannot Be Attained in the Present Life: Many Questions Must Be Submissively 
  Left in the Hands of God.
1. Having therefore the truth itself as our rule and the testimony concerning 
God set clearly before us, we ought not, by running after numerous and diverse 
answers to questions, to cast away the firm and true knowledge of God. But it is 
much more suitable that we, directing our inquiries after this fashion, should 
exercise ourselves in the investigation of the mystery and administration of the 
living God, and should increase in the love of Him who has done, and still does, 
so great things for us; but never should fall from the belief by which it is 
most clearly proclaimed that this Being alone is truly God and Father, who both 
formed this world, fashioned man, and bestowed the faculty of increase on His 
own creation, and called him upwards from lesser things to those greater ones 
which are in His own presence, just as He brings an infant which has been 
conceived in the womb into the light of the sun, and lays up wheat in the barn 
after He has given it full strength on the stalk. But it is one and the same 
Creator who both fashioned the womb and created the sun; and one and the same 
Lord who both reared the stalk of corn, increased and multiplied the wheat, and 
prepared the barn.
2. If, however, we cannot discover explanations of all those things in 
Scripture which are made the subject of investigation, yet let us not on that 
account seek after any other God besides Him who really exists. For this is the 
very greatest impiety. We should leave things of that nature to God who created 
us, being most properly assured that the Scriptures are indeed perfect, since 
they were spoken by the Word of God and His Spirit; but we, inasmuch as we are 
inferior to, and later in existence than, the Word of God and His Spirit, are on 
that very account
destitute of the knowledge of His mysteries. And there is no cause for wonder if 
this is the case with us as respects things spiritual and heavenly, and such as 
require to be made known to us by revelation, since many even of those things 
which lie at our very feet (I mean such as belong to this world, which we 
handle, and see, and are in close contact with) transcend out knowledge, so that 
even these we must leave to God. For it is fitting that He should excel all [in 
knowledge]. For how stands the case, for instance, if we endeavour to explain 
the cause of the rising of the Nile? We may say a great deal, plausible or 
otherwise, on the subject; but what is true, sure, and incontrovertible 
regarding it, belongs only to God. Then, again, the dwelling-place of birds-of 
those, I mean, which come to us in spring, but fly away again on the approach of 
autumn-though it is a matter connected with this world, escapes our 
knowledge.What explanation, again, can we give of the flow and ebb of the ocean, 
although every one admits there must be a certain cause [for these phenomena]? 
Or what can we say as to the nature of those things which lie beyond it?
What, moreover, can we say as to the formation of rain, lightning, thunder, 
gatherings of clouds, vapours, the bursting forth of winds, and such like 
things; of tell as to the storehouses of snow, hail, and other like things? 
[What do we know respecting] the conditions requisite for the preparation of 
clouds, or what is the real nature of the vapours in the sky? What as to the 
reason why the moon waxes and wanes, or what as to the cause of the difference 
of nature among various waters, metals, stones, and such like things? On all 
these points we may indeed say a great deal while we search into their causes, 
but God alone who made them can declare the truth regarding them.
3. If, therefore, even with respect to creation, there are some things [the 
knowledge of] Which belongs only to God, and others which come with in the range 
of our own knowledge, what ground is there for complaint, if, in regard to those 
things which we investigate in the Scriptures (which are throughout spiritual), 
we are able by the grace of God to explain some of them, while we must leave 
others in the hands of God, and that not only in the present world, but also in 
that which is to come, so that God should for ever teach, and man should for 
ever learn the things taught him by God? As the apostle has said on this point, 
that, when other things have been done away, then these three, "faith, hope, and 
charity, shall endure."
For faith, which has respect to our Master, endures 
unchangeably, assuring us that there is but one true God, and that we should 
truly love Him for ever, seeing that He alone is our Father; while we hope ever 
to be receiving more and more from God, and to learn from Him, because He is 
good, and possesses boundless riches, a kingdom without end, and instruction 
that can never be exhausted. If, therefore, according to the rule which I have 
stated, we leave some questions in the hands of God, we shall both preserve our 
faith uninjured, and shall continue without danger; and all Scripture, which has 
been given to us by God, shall be found by us perfectly consistent; and the 
parables shall harmonize with those passages which are perfectly plain; and 
those statements the meaning of which is clear, shall serve to explain the 
parables; and through the many diversified utterances [of Scripture] there shall 
be heard
one harmonious melody in us, praising in hymns that God who created all things. 
If, for instance, any one asks, "What was God doing before He made the world? 
"we reply that the answer to such a question lies with God Himself. For that 
this world was formed perfect
by God, receiving a beginning in time, the Scriptures teach us; but no Scripture 
reveals to us what God was employed about before this event. The answer 
therefore to that question remains with God, and it is not proper 
for us to aim at bringing forward foolish, rash, and blasphemous suppositions 
[in reply to it]; so, as by one's imagining that he has discovered the origin of 
matter, he should in reality set aside God Himself who made all things.
4. For consider, all ye who invent such opinions, since the Father Himself is 
alone called God, who has a real existence, but whom ye style the Demiurge; 
since, moreover, the Scriptures acknowledge Him alone as God; and yet again, 
since the Lord confesses Him alone as His own Father, and knows no other, as I 
shall show from His very words,-when ye style this very Being the fruit of 
defect, and the offspring of ignorance, and describe Him as being ignorant of 
those things which are above Him, with the various other allegations which you 
make regarding Him,-consider the terrible blasphemy [ye are thus guilty of] 
against Him who truly is God. Ye seem to affirm gravely and honestly enough that 
ye believe in God; but then, as ye are utterly unable to reveal any other God, 
ye declare this very Being in whom ye profess to believe, the fruit of defect 
and the offspring of ignorance. Now this blindness and foolish talking flow to 
you from the fact that ye reserve nothing for God, but ye wish to proclaim the 
nativity and production both of God Himself, of His Ennoea, of His Logos, and 
Life, and Christ; and ye form the idea of these from no other than a mere human 
experience; not understanding, as I said before, that it is possible, in the 
case of man, who is a compound being, to speak in this way of the mind of man 
and the thought of man; and to say that thought (enn&oelig;a) springs from mind (sensus), intention (enthymesis) again from thought, and word (logos) 
from intention (but which logos?
for there is among the Greeks one logos which is the principle that thinks, and 
another which is the instrument by means of which thought is expressed); and [to 
say] that a man sometimes is at rest and silent, while at other times he speaks 
and is active. But since God is
all mind, all reason, all active spirit, all light, and always exists one and 
the same, as it is both beneficial for us to think of God, and as we learn 
regarding Him from the Scriptures, such feelings and divisions [of operation] 
cannot fittingly be ascribed to Him. For our tongue, as being carnal, is not 
sufficient to minister to the rapidity of the human mind, inasmuch as that is of 
a spiritual nature, for which reason our word is restrained
within us, and is not at once expressed as it has been conceived by the mind, 
but is uttered by successive efforts, just as the tongue is able to serve 
it.
5. But God being all Mind, and all Logos, both speaks exactly what He thinks, 
and thinks exactly what He speaks. For His thought is Logos, and Logos is Mind, 
and Mind comprehending all things is the Father Himself. He, therefore, who 
speaks of the mind of God, and ascribes to it a special origin of its own, 
declares Him a compound Being, as if God were one thing, and the original Mind 
another. So, again, with respect to Logos, when one attributes to him the 
third place of production from the Father; on which supposition he is ignorant of His 
greatness; and thus Logos has been far separated from God. As for the prophet, 
he declares respecting Him, "Who shall describe His generation? "
But ye pretend to set forth His generation from the Father, and ye transfer the 
production of the word of men which takes place by means of a tongue to the Word 
of God, and thus are righteously exposed by your own selves as knowing neither 
things human nor divine.
6. But, beyond reason inflated [with your own wisdom], ye presumptuously 
maintain that ye are acquainted with the unspeakable mysteries of God; while 
even the Lord, the very Son of God, allowed that the Father alone knows the very 
day and hour of judgment, when He plainly declares, "But of that day and that 
hour knoweth no man, neither the Son, but the Father only." 
If, then, the Son was not ashamed to ascribe the knowledge of that day to the 
Father only, but declared what was true regarding the matter, neither let us be 
ashamed to reserve for God those greater questions which may occur to us. For no 
man is superior to his master.
If any one, therefore, says to us, "How then was the Son produced by the Father? 
"we reply to him, that no man understands that production, or generation, or 
calling, or revelation, or by whatever name one may describe His generation, 
which is in fact altogether indescribable. Neither Valentinus, nor Marcion, nor 
Saturninus, nor Basilides, nor angels, nor archangels, nor principalities, nor 
powers [possess this knowledge], but the Father only who begat, and the Son who 
was begotten. Since therefore His generation is unspeakable, those who strive to 
set forth generations and productions cannot be in their right mind, inasmuch as 
they undertake to describe things which are indescribable. For that a word is 
uttered at the bidding of thought and mind, all men indeed well understand. 
Those, therefore, who have excogitated [the theory of] emissions have not 
discovered anything great, or revealed any abstruse mystery, when they have 
simply transferred what all understand to the only-begotten Word of God; and 
while they style Him unspeakable and unnameable, they nevertheless set forth the 
production and formation of His first generation, as if they themselves had 
assisted at His birth, thus assimilating Him to the word of mankind formed by 
emissions.
7. But we shall not be wrong if we affirm the same thing also concerning the 
substance of matter, that God produced it. For we have learned from the 
Scriptures that God holds the supremacy over all things. But whence or in what 
way He produced it, neither has Scripture anywhere declared; nor does it become 
us to conjecture, so as, in accordance with our own opinions, to form endless 
conjectures concerning God, but we should leave such knowledge in the hands of 
God Himself. In like manner, also, we must leave the cause why, while all things 
were made by God, certain of His creatures sinned and revolted from a state of 
submission to God, and others, indeed the great majority, persevered, and do 
still persevere, in [willing] subjection to Him who formed them, and also of 
what nature those are who sinned, and of what nature those who persevere,-[we 
must, I say, leave the cause of these things] to God and His Word, to whom alone 
He said, "Sit at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy 
footstool." 
But as for us, we still dwell upon the earth, and have not yet sat down upon His 
throne. For although the Spirit of the Saviour that is in Him "searcheth all 
things, even the deep things of God,"
yet as to us "there are diversities of gifts, differences of administrations, 
and diversities of operations; "
and we, while upon the earth, as Paul also declares, "know in part, and prophesy 
in part."
Since, therefore, we know but in part, we ought to leave all sorts of 
[difficult] questions in the hands of Him who in some measure, [and that only, ] 
bestows grace on us. That eternal fire, [for instance, ] is prepared for 
sinners, both the Lord has plainly declared, and the rest of the Scriptures 
demonstrate. And that God fore-knew that this would happen, the Scriptures do in 
like manner demonstrate, since He prepared eternal fire from the beginning for 
those who were [afterwards] to transgress [His commandments]; but the cause 
itself of the nature of such transgressors neither has any Scripture informed 
us, nor has an apostle told us, nor has the Lord taught us. It becomes us, 
therefore, to leave the knowledge of this matter to God, even as the Lord does 
of the day and hour [of judgment], and not to rush to such an extreme of danger, 
that we will leave nothing in the hands of God, even though we have received 
only a measure of grace [from Him in this world]. But when we investigate points 
which are above us, and with respect to which we cannot reach satisfaction, [it 
is absurd 
] that we should display such an extreme of presumption as to lay open God, and 
things which are not yet discovered,
as if already we had found out, by the vain talk about emissions, God Himself, 
the Creator of all things, and to assert that He derived His substance from 
apostasy and ignorance, so as to frame an impious hypothesis in opposition to 
God.
8. Moreover, they possess no proof of their system, which has but recently 
been invented by them, sometimes resting upon certain numbers, sometimes on 
syllables, and sometimes, again, on names; and there are occasions, too, when, 
by means of those letters which are contained in letters, by parables not 
properly interpreted, or by certain [baseless] conjectures, they strive to 
establish that fabulous account which they have devised. For if any one should 
inquire the reason why the Father, who has fellowship with the Son in all 
things, has been declared by the Lord alone to know the hour and the day [of 
judgment], he will find at present no more suitable, or becoming, or safe reason 
than this (since, indeed, the Lord is the only true Master), that we may learn 
through Him that the Father is above all things. For "the Father," says He, "is 
greater than I."
The Father, therefore, has been declared by our Lord to excel with respect to 
knowledge; for this reason, that we, too, as long as we are connected with the 
scheme of things in this world, should leave perfect knowledge, and such 
questions [as have been mentioned], to God, and should not by any chance, while 
we seek to investigate the sublime nature of the Father, fall into the danger of 
starting the question whether there is another God above God. 

9. But if any lover of strife contradict what I have said, and also what the 
apostle affirms, that "we know in part, and prophesy in part,"
and imagine that he has acquired not a partial, but a universal, knowledge of 
all that exists,-being such an one as Valentinus, or Ptolemaeus, or Basilides, 
or any other of those who maintain that they have searched out the deep
things of God,-let him not (arraying himself in vainglory) boast that he has 
acquired greater knowledge than others with respect to those things which are 
invisible, or cannot be placed under our observation; but let him, by making 
diligent inquiry, and obtaining information from the Father, tell us the reasons 
(which we know not) of those things which are in this world,-as, for instance, 
the number of hairs on his own head, and the sparrows which are captured day by 
day, and such other points with which we are not previously acquainted,-so that 
we may credit him also with respect to more important points. But if those who 
are perfect do not yet understand the very things in their hands, and at 
their feet, and before their eyes, and on the earth, and especially the rule 
followed with respect to the hairs of their head, how can we believe them 
regarding things spiritual, and super-celestial,
and those which, with a vain confidence, they assert to be above God? So much, 
then, I have said concerning numbers, and names, and syllables, and questions 
respecting such things as are above our comprehension, and concerning their 
improper expositions of the parables: [I add no more on these points, ] since 
thou thyself mayest enlarge upon them.

Chapter XXIX.-Refutation of the 
  Views of the Heretics as to the Future Destiny of the Soul and 
Body.
1. Let us return, however, to the remaining points of their system. For when 
they declare
that, at the consummation of all things, their mother shall re-enter the 
Pleroma, and receive the Saviour as her consort; that they themselves, as being 
spiritual, when they have got rid of their animal souls, and become intellectual 
spirits, will be the consorts of the spiritual angels; but that the Demiurge, 
since they call him animal, will pass into the place of the Mother; that the 
souls of the righteous shall psychically repose in the intermediate place;-when 
they declare that like will be gathered to like, spiritual things to spiritual, 
while material things continue among those that are material, they do in fact 
contradict themselves, inasmuch as they no longer maintain that souls pass, on 
account of their nature, into the intermediate place to those substances which 
are similar to themselves, but [that they do so] on account of the deeds done 
[in the body], since they affirm that those of the righteous do pass [into that 
abode], but those of the impious continue in the fire. For if it is on account 
of their nature that all souls attain to the place of enjoyment, 
and all belong to the intermediate place simply because they are souls, as being 
thus of the same nature with it, then it follows that faith is altogether 
superfluous, as was also the descent
of the Saviour [to this world]. If, on the other hand, it is on account of their 
righteousness [that they attain to such a place of rest], then it is no longer 
because they are souls but because they are righteous. But if 
souls would have
perished unless they had been righteous, then righteousness must have power to 
save the bodies also [which these souls inhabited]; for why should it not save 
them, since they, too, participated in righteousness? For if nature and 
substance are the means of salvation, then all souls shall be saved; but if 
righteousness and faith, why should these not save those bodies which, equally 
with the souls, will enter 
into immortality? For righteousness will appear, in matters of this kind, either 
impotent or unjust, if indeed it saves some substances through participating in 
it, but not others.
2. For it is manifest that those acts which are deemed righteous are 
performed in bodies. Either, therefore, all souls will of necessity pass into 
the intermediate place, and there will never be a judgment; or bodies, too, 
which have participated in righteousness, will attain to the place of enjoyment, 
along with the souls which have in like manner participated, if indeed 
righteousness is powerful enough to bring thither those substances which have 
participated in it. And then the doctrine concerning the resurrection of bodies 
which we believe, will emerge true and certain [from their system]; since, [as 
we hold, ] God, when He resuscitates our mortal bodies which preserved 
righteousness, will render them incorruptible and immortal. For God is superior 
to nature, and has in Himself the disposition [to show kindness], because He is 
good; and the ability to do so, because He is mighty; and the faculty of fully 
carrying out His purpose, because He is rich and perfect.
3. But these men are in all points inconsistent with themselves, when they 
decide that all souls do not enter into the intermediate place, but those of the 
righteous only. For they maintain that, according to nature and substance, three 
sorts [of being] were produced by the Mother: the first, which proceeded from 
perplexity, and weariness, and fear-that is material substance; the second from 
impetuosity
-that is animal substance; but that which she brought forth after the vision of 
those angels who wait upon Christ, is spiritual substance. If, then, that 
substance 
which she brought forth will by all means enter into the Pleroma because it is 
spiritual, while that which is material will remain below because it is 
material, and shall be totally consumed by the fire which bums within it, why 
should not the whole animal substance go into the intermediate place, into which 
also they send the Demiurge? But what is it which shall enter within their 
Pleroma? For they maintain that souls shall continue in the intermediate place, 
while bodies, because they possess material substance, when they have been 
resolved into matter, shall be consumed by that fire which exists in it; but 
their body being thus destroyed, and their soul remaining in the intermediate 
place, no part of man will any longer be left to enter in within the Pleroma. 
For the intellect of man-his mind, thought, mental intention, and such like-is 
nothing else than his soul; but the emotions and operations of the soul itself 
have no substance apart from the soul. What part of them, then, will still 
remain to enter into the Pleroma? For they themselves, in as far as they are 
souls, remain in the intermediate place; while, in as far as they are body, they 
will be consumed with the rest of matter.

Chapter XXX.-Absurdity of Their 
  Styling Themselves Spiritual, While the Demiurge is Declared to Be 
  Animal.
1. Such being the state of the case, these infatuated men declare that they 
rise above the Creator (Demiurge); and, inasmuch as they proclaim themselves 
superior to that God who made and adorned the heavens, and the earth, and all 
things that are in them, and maintain that they themselves are spiritual, while 
they are in fact shamefully carnal on account of their so great 
impiety,-affirming that He, who has made His angels
spirits, and is clothed with light as with a garment, and holds the 
circle 
of the earth, as it were, in His hand, in whose sight its inhabitants are 
counted as grasshoppers, and who is the Creator and Lord of all spiritual 
substance, is of an animal nature,-they do beyond doubt and verily betray their 
own madness; and, as if truly struck with thunder, even more than those giants 
who are spoken of in [heathen] fables, they lift up their opinions against God, 
inflated by a vain presumption and unstable glory,-men for whose purgation all 
the hellebore 
on earth would not suffice, so that they should get rid of their intense 
folly.
2. The superior person is to be proved by his deeds. In what way, then, can 
they show themselves superior to the Creator (that I too, through the necessity 
of the argument in hand, may come down to the level of their impiety, 
instituting a comparison between God and foolish men, and, by descending to 
their argument, may often refute them by their own doctrines; but in thus acting 
may God be merciful to me, for I venture on these statements, not with the view 
of comparing Him to them, but of convicting and overthrowing their insane 
opinions)-they, for whom many foolish persons entertain so great an admiration, 
as if, forsooth, they could learn from them something more precious than the 
truth itself! That expression of Scripture, "Seek, and ye shall find," 
they interpret as spoken with this view, that they should discover themselves to 
be above the Creator, styling themselves greater and better than God, and 
calling themselves spiritual, but the Creator animal; and [affirming] that for 
this reason they rise upwards above God, for that they enter in within the 
Pleroma, while He remains in the intermediate place. Let them, then, prove 
themselves by their deeds superior to the Creator; for the superior person ought 
to be proved not by what is said, but by what has a real existence.
3. What work, then, will they point to as having been accomplished through 
themselves by the Saviour, or by their Mother, either greater, or more glorious, 
or more adorned with wisdom, than those which have been produced by Him who was 
the disposer of all around us? What heavens have they established? what earth 
have they founded? what stars have they called into existence? or what lights of 
heaven have they caused to shine? within what circles, moreover, have they 
confined them? or, what rains, or frosts, or snows, each suited to the season, 
and to every special climate, have they brought upon the earth? And again, in 
opposition to these, what heat or dryness have they set over against them? or, 
what rivers have they made to flow? what fountains have they brought forth? with 
what flowers and trees have they adorned this sublunary world? or, what 
multitude of animals have they formed, some rational, and others irrational, but 
all adorned with beauty? And who can enumerate one by one all the remaining 
objects which have been constituted by the power of God, and are governed by His 
wisdom? or who can search out the greatness of that God who made them? And what 
can be told of those existences which are above heaven, and which do not pass 
away, such as Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, and Powers innumerable? 
Against what one of these works, then, do they set themselves in opposition? 
What have they similar to show, as having been made through themselves, or by 
themselves, since even they too are the Workmanship and creatures of this 
[Creator]? For whether the Saviour or their Mother (to use their own 
expressions, proving them false by means of the very terms they themselves 
employ) used this Being, as they maintain, to make an image of those things 
which are within the Pleroma, and of all those beings which she saw waiting upon 
the Saviour, she used him (the Demiurge) as being [in a sense] superior to 
herself, and better fitted to accomplish her purpose through his 
instrumentality; for she would by no means form the images of such important 
beings through means of an inferior, but by a superior, agent.
4. For, [be it observed, ] they themselves, according to their own 
declarations, were then existing, as a spiritual conception, in consequence of 
the contemplation of those beings who were arranged as satellites around 
Pandora. And they indeed continued useless, the Mother accomplishing nothing 
through their instrumentality,
-an idle conception, owing their being to the Saviour, and fit for nothing, for 
not a thing appears to have been done by them. But the God who, according to 
them, was produced, while, as they argue, inferior to themselves (for they 
maintain that he is of an animal nature), was nevertheless the active agent in 
all things, efficient, and fit for the work to be done, so that by him the 
images of all things were made; and not only were these things which are seen 
formed by him, but also all things invisible, Angels, Archangels, Dominations, 
Powers, and Virtues,-[by him, I say, ] as being the superior, and capable of 
ministering to her desire. But it seems that the Mother made nothing whatever 
through their instrumentality, as indeed they themselves acknowledge; so that 
one may justly reckon them as having been an abortion produced by the painful 
travail of their Mother. For no accoucheurs performed their office upon her, and 
therefore they were cast forth as an abortion, useful for nothing, and formed to 
accomplish no work of the Mother. And yet they describe themselves as being 
superior to Him by whom so vast and admirable works have been accomplished and 
arranged, although by their own reasoning they are found to be so wretchedly 
inferior!
5. It is as if there were two iron tools, or instruments, the one of which 
was continually in the workman's hands and in constant use, and by the use of 
which he made whatever he pleased, and displayed his art and skill, but the 
other of which remained idle and useless, never being called into operation, the 
workman never appearing to make anything by it, and making no use of it in any 
of his labours; and then one should maintain that this useless, and idle, and 
unemployed tool was superior in nature and value to that which the artisan 
employed in his work, and by means of which he acquired his reputation. Such a 
man, if any such were found, would justly be regarded as imbecile, and not in 
his right mind. And so should those be judged of who speak of themselves as 
being spiritual and superior, and of the Creator as possessed of an animal 
nature, and maintain that for this reason they will ascend on high, and 
penetrate within the Pleroma to their own husbands (for, according to their own 
statements, they are themselves feminine), but that God [the Creator] is of an 
inferior nature, and therefore remains in the intermediate place, while all the 
time they bring forward no proofs of these assertions: for the better man is 
shown by his works, and all works have been accomplished by the Creator; but 
they, having nothing worthy of reason to point to as having been produced by 
themselves, are labouring under the greatest and most incurable madness.
6. If, however, they labour to maintain that, while all material things, such 
as the heaven, and the whole world which exists below it, were indeed formed by 
the Demiurge, yet all things of a more spiritual nature than these,-those, 
namely, which are above the heavens, such as Principalities, Powers, Angels, 
Archangels, Dominations, Virtues,-were produced by a spiritual process of birth 
(which they declare themselves to be), then, in the first place, we prove from 
the authoritative Scriptures 
that all the things which have been mentioned, visible and invisible, have been 
made by one God. For these men are not more to be depended on than the 
Scriptures; nor ought we to give up the declarations of the Lord, Moses, and the 
rest of the prophets, who have proclaimed the truth, and give credit to them, 
who do indeed utter nothing of a sensible nature, but rave about untenable 
opinions. And, in the next place, if those things which are above the heavens 
were really made through their instrumentality, then let them inform us what is 
the nature of things invisible, recount the number of the Angels, and the ranks 
of the Archangels, reveal the mysteries of the Thrones, and teach us the 
differences between the Dominations, Principalities, Powers, and Virtues. But 
they can say nothing respecting them; therefore these beings were not made by 
them. If, on the other hand, these were made by the Creator, as was really the 
case, and are of a spiritual and holy character, then it follows that He who 
produced spiritual beings is not Himself of an animal nature, and thus their 
fearful system of blasphemy is overthrown.
7. For that there are spiritual creatures in the heavens, all the Scriptures 
loudly proclaim; and Paul expressly testifies that there are spiritual things 
when he declares that he was caught up into the third heaven, 
and again, that he was carried away to paradise, and heard unspeakable words 
which it is not lawful for a man to utter. But what did that profit him, either 
his entrance into paradise or his assumption into the third heaven, since all 
these things are still but under the power of the Demiurge, if, as some venture 
to maintain, he had already begun
to be a spectator and a hearer of those mysteries which are affirmed to be above 
the Demiurge? For if it is true that he was becoming acquainted with that order 
of things which is above the Demiurge, he would by no means have remained in the 
regions of the Demiurge, and that so as not even thoroughly to explore even 
these (for, according to their manner of speaking, there still lay before him 
four heavens, 
if he were to approach the Demiurge, and thus behold the whole seven lying 
beneath him); but he might have been admitted, perhaps, into the intermediate 
place, that is, into the presence of the Mother, that he might receive 
instruction from her as to the things within the Pleroma. For that inner man 
which was in him, and spoke in him, as they say, though invisible, could have 
attained not only to the third heaven, but even as far as the presence of their 
Mother. For if they maintain that they themselves, that is, their [inner] man, 
at once ascends above the Demiurge, and departs to the Mother, much more must 
this have occurred to the [inner] man of the apostle; for the Demiurge would not 
have hindered him, being, as they assert, himself already subject to the 
Saviour. But if he had tried to hinder him, the effort would have gone for 
nothing. For it is not possible that he should prove stronger than the 
providence of the Father, and that when the tuner man is said to be invisible 
even to the Demiurge. But since he (Paul) has described that assumption of 
himself up to the third heaven as something great and pre-eminent, it cannot be 
that these men ascend above the seventh heaven, for they are certainly not 
superior to the apostle. If they do maintain that they are more excellent than 
he, let them prove themselves so by their works, for they have never pretended 
to anything like [what he describes as occurring to himself]. And for this 
reason he added, "Whether in the body, or whether out of the body, God 
knoweth," 
that the body might neither be thought to be a partaker in that vision,
as if it could have participated in those things which it had seen and heard; 
nor, again, that any one should say that he was not carried higher on account of 
the weight of the body; but it is therefore thus far permitted even without the 
body to behold spiritual mysteries which are the operations of God, who made the 
heavens and the earth, and formed man, and placed him in paradise, so that those 
should be spectators of them who, like the apostle, have reached a high degree 
of perfection in the love of God.
8. This Being, therefore, also made spiritual things, of which, as far as to 
the third heaven, the apostle was made a spectator, and heard unspeakable words 
which it is not possible for a man to utter, inasmuch as they are spiritual; and 
He Himself bestows
[gifts] on the worthy as inclination prompts Him, for paradise is His; and He is 
truly the Spirit of God, and not an animal Demiurge, otherwise He should never 
have created spiritual things. But if He really is of an animal nature, then let 
them inform us by whom spiritual things were made. They have no proof which they 
can give friar this was done by means of the travail of their Mother, which they 
declare themselves to be. For, not to speak of spiritual things, these men 
cannot create even a fly, or a gnat, or any other small and insignificant 
animal, without observing that law by which from the beginning animals have been 
and are naturally produced by God-through the deposition of seed in those that 
are of the same species. Nor was anything formed by the Mother alone; [for] they 
say that this Demiurge was produced by her, and that he was the Lord (the 
author) of all creation. And they maintain that he who is the Creator and Lord 
of all that has been made is of an animal nature, while they assert that they 
themselves are spiritual,-they who are neither the authors nor lords of any one 
work, not only of those things which are extraneous to them, but not even of 
their own bodies! Moreover, these men, who call themselves spiritual, and 
superior to the Creator, do often suffer much bodily pain, sorely against their 
will.
9. Justly, therefore, do we convict them of having departed far and wide from 
the truth. For if the Saviour formed the things which have been made, by means 
of him (the Demiurge), he is proved in that case not to be inferior but superior 
to them, since he is found to have been the former even of themselves; for they, 
too, have a place among created things. How, then, can it be argued that these 
men indeed are spiritual, but that he by whom they were created is of an animal 
nature? Or, again, if (which is indeed the only true supposition, as I have 
shown by numerous arguments of the very clearest nature) He (the Creator) made 
all things freely, and by His own power, and arranged and finished them, and His 
will is the substance 
of all things, then He is discovered to be the one only God who created all 
things, who alone is Omnipotent, and who is the only Father rounding and forming 
all things, visible and invisible, such as may be perceived by our senses and 
such as cannot, heavenly and earthly, "by the word of His power; " 
and He has fitted and arranged all things by His wisdom, while He contains all 
things, but He Himself can be contained by no one: He is the Former, He the 
Builder, He the Discoverer, He the Creator, He the Lord of all; and there is no 
one besides Him, or above Him, neither has He any mother, as they falsely 
ascribe to Him; nor is there a second God, as Marcion has imagined; nor is there 
a Pleroma of thirty Aeons, which has been shown a vain supposition; nor is there 
any such being as Bythus or Proarche; nor are there a series of heavens; nor is 
there a virginal light, 
nor an unnameable Aeon, nor, in fact, any one of those things which are madly 
dreamt of by these, and by all the heretics. But there is one only God, the 
Creator-He who is above every Principality, and Power, and Dominion, and Virtue: 
He is Father, He is God, He the Founder, He the Maker, He the Creator, who made 
those things by Himself, that is, through His Word and His Wisdom-heaven and 
earth, and the seas, and all things that are in them: He is just; He is good; He 
it is who formed man, who planted paradise, who made the world, who gave rise to 
the flood, who saved Noah; He is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and 
the God of Jacob, the God of the living: He it is whom the law proclaims, whom 
the prophets preach, whom Christ reveals, whom the apostles make known
to us, and in whom the Church believes. He is the Father of our Lord Jesus 
Christ: through His Word, who is His Son, through Him He is revealed and 
manifested to all to whom He is revealed; for those [only] know Him to whom the 
Son has revealed Him. But the Son, eternally co-existing with the Father, from 
of old, yea, from the beginning, always reveals the Father to Angels, 
Archangels, Powers, Virtues, and all to whom He wills that God should be 
revealed.

Chapter XXXI.-Recapitulation and 
  Application of the Foregoing Arguments.
1. Those, then, who are of the school of Valentinus being overthrown, the 
whole multitude of heretics are, in fact, also subverted. For all the arguments 
I have advanced against their Pleroma, and with respect to those things which 
are beyond it, showing how the Father of all is shut up and circumscribed by 
that which is beyond Him (if, indeed, there be anything beyond Him), and how 
there is an absolute necessity [on their theory] to conceive of many Fathers, 
and many Pleromas, and many creations of worlds, beginning with one set and 
ending with another, as existing on every side; and that all [the beings 
referred to] continue in their own domains, and do not curiously intermeddle 
with others, since, indeed, no common interest nor any fellowship exists between 
them; and that there is no other God of all, but that that name belongs only to 
the Almighty;-[all these arguments, I say, ] will in like manner apply against 
those who are of the school of Marcion, and Simon, and Meander, or whatever 
others there may be who, like them, cut off that creation with which we are 
connected from the Father. The arguments, again, which I have employed against 
those who maintain that the Father of all no doubt contains all things, but that 
the creation to which we belong was not formed by Him, but by a certain other 
power, or by angels having no knowledge of the Propator, who is surrounded as a 
centre by the immense extent of the universe, just as a stain is by the 
[surrounding] cloak; when I showed that it is not a probable supposition that 
any other being than the Father of all formed that creation to which we 
belong,-these same arguments will apply against the followers of Saturninus, 
Basilides, Carpocrates, and the rest of the Gnostics, who express similar 
opinions. Those statements, again, which have been made with respect to the 
emanations, and the Aeons, and the [supposed state of] degeneracy, and the 
inconstant character of their Mother, equally overthrow Basilides, and all who 
are falsely styled Gnostics, who do, in fact, just repeat the same views under 
different names, but do, to a greater extent than the former, 
transfer those things which lie outside 
of the truth to the system of their own doctrine. And the remarks I have made 
respecting numbers will also apply against all those who misappropriate things 
belonging to the truth for the support of a system of this kind. And all that 
has been said respecting the Creator (Demiurge) to show that he alone is God and 
Father of all, and whatever remarks may yet be made in the following books, I 
apply against the heretics at large. The more moderate and reasonable among them 
thou wilt convert and convince, so as to lead them no longer to blaspheme their 
Creator, and Maker, and Sustainer, and Lord, nor to ascribe His origin to defect 
and ignorance; but the fierce, and terrible, and irrational [among them] thou 
wilt drive far from thee, that you may no longer have to endure their idle 
loquaciousness.
2. Moreover, those also will be thus confuted who belong to Simon and 
Carpocrates, and if there be any others who are said to perform miracles-who do 
not perform what they do either through the power of God, or in connection with 
the truth, nor for the well-being of men, but for the sake of destroying and 
misleading mankind, by means of magical deceptions, and with universal deceit, 
thus entailing greater harm than good on those who believe them, with respect to 
the point on which they lead them astray. For they can neither confer sight on 
the blind, nor hearing on the deaf, nor chase away all sorts of demons-[none, 
indeed, ] except those that are sent into others by themselves, if they can even 
do so much as this. Nor can they cure the weak, or the lame, or the paralytic, 
or those who are distressed in any other part of the body, as has often been 
done in regard to bodily infinity. Nor can they furnish effective remedies for 
those external accidents which may occur. And so far are they from being able to 
raise the dead, as the Lord raised them, and the apostles did by means of 
prayer, and as has been frequently done in the brotherhood on account of some 
necessity-the entire Church in that particular locality entreating [the boon] 
with much fasting and prayer, the spirit of the dead man has returned, and he 
has been bestowed in answer to the prayers of the saints-that they do not even 
believe this can be possibly be done, [and hold] that the resurrection from the 
dead is simply an acquaintance with that truth which they proclaim.
3. Since, therefore, there exist among them error and misleading influences, 
and magical illusions are impiously wrought in the sight of men; but in the 
Church, sympathy, and compassion, and stedfastness, and truth, for the aid and 
encouragement of mankind, are not only displayed 
without fee or reward, but we ourselves lay out for the benefit of others our 
own means; and inasmuch as those who are cured very frequently do not possess 
the things which they require, they receive them from us;-[since such is the 
case, ] these men are in this way undoubtedly proved to be utter aliens from the 
divine nature, the beneficence of God, and all spiritual excellence. But they 
are altogether full of deceit of every kind, apostate inspiration, demoniacal 
working, and the phantasms of idolatry, and are in reality the predecessors of 
that dragon who, by means of a deception of the same kind, will with his tail cause a third 
part of the stars to fall from their place, and will cast them down to the 
earth. It behoves us to flee from them as we would from him; and the greater the 
display with which they are said to perform [their marvels], the more carefully 
should we watch them, as having been endowed with a greater spirit of 
wickedness. If any one will consider the prophecy referred to, and the daily 
practices of these men, he will find that their manner of acting is one and the 
same with the demons.

Chapter XXXII.-Further Exposure of 
  the Wicked and Blasphemous Doctrines of the Heretics.
1. Moreover, this impious opinion of theirs with respect to actions-namely, 
that it is incumbent on them to have experience of all kinds of deeds, even the 
most abominable-is refuted by the teaching of the Lord, with whom not only is 
the adulterer rejected, but also the man who desires to commit adultery;
and not only is the actual murderer held guilty of having killed another to his 
own damnation, but the man also who is angry with his brother without a cause: 
who commanded [His disciples] not only not to hate men, but also to love their 
enemies; and enjoined them not only not to swear falsely, but not even to swear 
at all; and not only not to speak evil of their neighbours, but not even to 
style any one "Raca" and "fool; "[declaring] that otherwise they were in danger 
of hell-fire; and not only not to strike, but even, when themselves struck, to 
present the other cheek [to those that maltreated them]; and not only not to 
refuse to give up the property of others, but even if their own were taken away, 
not to demand it back again from those that took it; and not only not to injure 
their neighbours, nor to do them any evil, but also, when themselves wickedly 
dealt with, to be long-suffering, and to show kindness towards those [that 
injured them], and to pray for them, that by means of repentance they might be 
saved-so that we should in no respect imitate the arrogance, lust, and pride of 
others. Since, therefore, He whom these men boast of as their Master, and of 
whom they affirm that He had a soul greatly better and more highly toned than 
others, did indeed, with much earnestness, command certain things to be done as 
being good and excellent, and certain things to be abstained from not only in 
their actual perpetration, but even in the thoughts which lead to their 
performance, as being wicked, pernicious, and abominable,-how then can they 
escape being put to confusion, when they affirm that such a Master was more 
highly toned [in spirit] and better than others, and yet manifestly give 
instruction of a kind utterly opposed to His teaching? And, again, if there were 
really no such thing as good and evil, but certain things were deemed righteous, 
and certain others unrighteous, in human opinion only, He never would have 
expressed Himself thus in His teaching: "The righteous shall shine forth as the 
sun in the kingdom of their Father;"
but He shall send the unrighteous, and those who do not the works of 
righteousness, "into everlasting fire, where their worm shall not die, and the 
fire shall not be quenched." 

2. When they further maintain that it is cumbent on them to have experience 
of every kind 
of work and conduct, so that, if it be possible, accomplishing all during one 
manifestation in this life, they may [at once] pass over to the state of 
perfection, they are, by no chance, found striving to do those things which wait 
upon virtue, and are laborious, glorious, and skilful, 
which also are approved universally as being good. For if it be necessary to go 
through every work and every kind of operation, they ought, in the first place, 
to learn all the arts: all of them, [I say, ] whether referring to theory or 
practice, whether they be acquired by self-denial, or are mastered through means 
of labour, exercise, and perseverance; as, for example, every kind of music, 
arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and all such as are occupied with intellectual 
pursuits: then, again, the whole study of medicine, and the knowledge of plants, 
so as to become acquainted with those which are prepared for the health of man; 
the art of painting and sculpture, brass and marble work, and the kindred arts: 
moreover, [they have to study] every kind of country labour, the veterinary art, 
pastoral occupations, the various kinds of skilled labour, which are said to 
pervade the whole circle of [human] exertion; those, again, connected with a 
maritime life, gymnastic exercises, hunting, military and kingly pursuits, and 
as many others as may exist, of which, with the utmost labour, they could not 
learn the tenth, or even the thousandth part, in the whole course of their 
lives. The fact indeed is, that they endeavour to learn none of these, although 
they maintain that it is incumbent on them to have experience of every kind of 
work; but, turning aside to voluptuousness, and lust, and abominable actions, 
they stand self-condemned when they are tried by their own doctrine. For, since 
they are destitute of all those [virtues] which have been mentioned, they will 
[of necessity] pass into the destruction of fire. These men, while they boast of 
Jesus as being their Master, do in fact emulate the philosophy of Epicurus and 
the indifference of the Cynics, [calling Jesus their Master, ] who not only 
turned His disciples away from evil deeds, but even from [wicked] words and 
thoughts, as I have already shown.
3. Again, while they assert that they possess souls from the same sphere as 
Jesus, and that they are like to Him, sometimes even maintaining that they are 
superior; while [they affirm that they were] produced, like Him, for the 
performance of works tending to the benefit and establishment of mankind, they 
are found doing nothing of the same or a like kind [with His actions], nor what 
can in any respect be brought into comparison with them. And if they have in 
truth accomplished anything [remarkable] by means of magic, they strive [in this 
way] deceitfully to lead foolish people astray, since they confer no real 
benefit or blessing on those over whom they declare that they exert] 
supernatural] power; but, bringing forward mere boys
[as the subjects on whom they practise], and deceiving their sight, while they 
exhibit phantasms that instantly cease, and do not endure even a moment of 
time, they are proved to be like, not Jesus our Lord, but Simon the magician. It is 
certain, too, from the fact that the Lord rose from the dead on the third day, and 
manifested Himself to His disciples, and was in their sight received up into 
heaven, that, inasmuch as these men die, and do not rise again, nor manifest 
themselves to any, they are proved as possessing souls in no respect similar to 
that of Jesus.
4. If, however, they maintain that the Lord, too, performed such works simply 
in appearance, we shall refer them to the prophetical writings, and prove from 
these both that all things were thus
predicted regarding Him, and did take place undoubtedly, and that He is the only 
Son of God. Wherefore, also, those who are in truth His disciples, receiving 
grace from Him, do in His name perform [miracles], so as to promote the welfare 
of other men, according to the gift which each one has received from Him. For 
some do certainly and truly drive out devils, so that those who have thus been 
cleansed from evil spirits frequently both believe [in Christ], and join 
themselves to the Church. Others have foreknowledge of things to come: they see 
visions, and utter prophetic expressions. Others still, heal the sick by laying 
their hands upon them, and they are made whole. Yea, moreover, as I have said, 
the dead even have been raised up, and remained 
among us for many years. And what shall I more say? It is not possible to name 
the number of the gifts which the Church, [scattered] throughout the whole 
world, has received from God, in the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified 
under Pontius Pilate, and which she exerts day by day for the benefit of the 
Gentiles, neither practising deception upon any, nor taking any reward
from them Ion account of such miraculous interpositions]. For as she has 
received freely
from God, freely also does she minister [to others].
5. Nor does she perform anything by means of angelic invocations,
or by incantations, or by any other wicked curious art; but, directing her 
prayers to the Lord, who made all things, in a pure, sincere, and 
straightforward spirit, and calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, she 
has been accustomed to work 
miracles for the advantage of mankind, and not to lead them into error. If, 
therefore, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ even now confers benefits [upon 
men], and cures thoroughly and effectively all who anywhere believe on Him, but 
not that of Simon, or Menander, or Carpocrates, or of any other man whatever, it 
is manifest that. when He was made man, He held fellowship with His own 
creation, and
did all things truly through the power of God, according to the will of the 
Father of all, as the prophets had foretold. But what these things were, shall 
be described in dealing with the proofs to be found in the prophetical 
writings.

Chapter XXXIII.-Absurdity of the 
  Doctrine of the Transmigration of Souls.
1. We may subvert their doctrine as to transmigration from body to body by 
this fact, that souls remember nothing whatever of the events which took place 
in their previous states of existence. For if they were sent forth with this 
object, that they should have experience of every kind of action, they must of 
necessity retain a remembrance of those things which have been previously 
accomplished, that they might fill up those in which they were still deficient, 
and not by always hovering, without intermission, round the same pursuits, spend 
their labour wretchedly in vain (for the mere union of a body [with a soul] 
could not altogether extinguish the memory and contemplation of those things 
which had formerly been experienced
), and especially as they came [into the world] for this very purpose. For as, 
when the body is asleep and at rest, whatever things the soul sees by herself, 
and does in a vision, recollecting many of these, she also communicates them to 
the body; and as it happens that, when one awakes, perhaps after a long time, he 
relates what he saw in a dream, so also would he undoubtedly remember those 
things which he did before he came into this particular body. For if that which 
is seen only for a very brief space of time, or has been conceived of simply in 
a phantasm, and by the soul alone, through means of a dream, is remembered after 
she has mingled again with the body, and been dispersed through all the members, 
much more would she remember those things in connection with which she stayed 
during so long a time, even throughout the whole period of a bypast life.
2. With reference to these objections, Plato, that ancient Athenian, who also 
was the first to introduce this opinion, when he could not set them aside, invented the 
[notion of] a cup of oblivion, imagining that in this way he would escape this 
son of difficulty. He attempted no kind of proof [of his supposition], but 
simply replied dogmatically [to the objection in question], that when souls 
enter into this life, they are caused to drink of oblivion by that demon who 
watches their entrance [into the world], before they effect an entrance into the 
bodies [assigned them]. It escaped him, that [by speaking thus] he fell into 
another greater perplexity. For if the cup of oblivion, after it has been drunk, 
can obliterate the memory of all the deeds that have been done, how, O Plato, 
dost thou obtain the knowledge of this fact (since thy soul is now in the body), 
that, before it entered into the body, it was made to drink by the demon a drug 
which caused oblivion? For if thou hast a remembrance of the demon, and the cup, 
and the entrance [into life], thou oughtest also to be acquainted with other 
things; but if, on the other hand, thou art ignorant of them, then there is no 
truth in the story of the demon, nor in the cup of oblivion prepared with 
art.
3. In opposition, again, to those who affirm that the body itself is the drug 
of oblivion, this observation may be made: How, then, does it come to pass, that 
whatsoever the soul sees by her own instrumentality, both in dreams and by 
reflection or earnest mental exertion, while the body is passive, she remembers, 
and reports to her neighbours? But, again, if the body itself were [the cause 
of] oblivion, then the soul, as existing in the body, could not remember even 
those things which were perceived long ago either by means of the eyes or the 
ears; but, as soon as the eye was turned from the things looked at, the memory 
of them also would undoubtedly be destroyed. For the soul, as existing in the 
very [cause of] oblivion, could have no knowledge of anything else than that 
only which it saw at the present moment. How, too, could it become acquainted 
with divine things, and retain a remembrance of them while existing in the body, 
since, as they maintain, the body itself is [the cause of] oblivion? But the 
prophets also, when they were upon the earth, remembered likewise, on their 
returning to their ordinary state of mind,
whatever things they spiritually saw or heard in visions of heavenly objects, 
and related them to others. The body, therefore, does not cause the soul to 
forget those things which have been spiritually witnessed; but the soul teaches 
the body, and shares with it the spiritual vision which it has enjoyed.
4. For the body is not possessed of greater power than the soul, since indeed 
the former is inspired, and vivified, and increased, and held together by the 
latter; but the soul possesses
and rules over the body. It is doubtless retarded in its velocity, just in the 
exact proportion in which the body shares in its motion; but it never loses the 
knowledge which properly belongs to it. For the body may be compared to an 
instrument; but the soul is possessed of the reason of an artist. As, therefore, 
the artist finds the idea of a work to spring up rapidly in his mind, but can 
only carry it out slowly by means of an instrument, owing to the want of perfect 
pliability in the matter acted upon, and thus the rapidity of his mental 
operation, being blended with the slow action of the instrument, gives rise to a 
moderate kind of movement [towards the end contemplated]; so also the soul, by 
being mixed up with the body belonging to it, is in a certain measure impeded, 
its rapidity being blended with the body's slowness. Yet it does not lose 
altogether its own peculiar powers; but while, as it were, sharing life with the 
body, it does not itself cease to live. Thus, too, while communicating other 
things to the body, it neither loses the knowledge of them, nor the memory of 
those things which have been witnessed.
5. If, therefore, the soul remembers nothing 
of what took place in a former state of existence, but has a perception of those 
things which are here, it follows that she never existed in other bodies, nor 
did things of which she has no knowledge, nor [once] knew things which she 
cannot [now mentally] contemplate. But, as each one of us receives his body 
through the skilful working of God, so does he also possess his soul. For God is 
not so poor or destitute in resources, that He cannot confer its own proper soul 
on each individual body, even as He gives it also its special character. And 
therefore, when the number [fixed upon] is completed, [that number] which He had 
predetermined in His own counsel, all those who have been enrolled for life 
[eternal] shah rise again, having their own bodies, and having also their own 
souls, and their own spirits, in which they had pleased God. Those, on the other 
hand, who are worthy of punishment, shall go away into it, they too having their 
own souls and their own bodies, in which they stood apart from the grace of God. 
Both classes shall then cease from any longer begetting and being begotten, from 
marrying and being given in marriage; so that the number of mankind, 
corresponding to the fore-ordination of God, being completed, may fully realize 
the scheme formed by the Father. 


Chapter XXXIV.-Souls Can Be 
  Recognised in the Separate State, and are Immortal Although They Once Had a 
  Beginning.
1. The Lord has taught with very great fulness, that souls not only continue 
to exist, not by passing from body to body, but that they preserve the same 
form
[in their separate state] as the body had to which they were adapted, and that 
they remember the deeds which they did in this state of existence, and from 
which they have now ceased,-in that narrative which is recorded respecting the 
rich man and that Lazarus who found repose in the bosom of Abraham. In this 
account He states 
that Dives knew Lazarus after death, and Abraham in like manner, and that each 
one of these persons continued in his own proper position, and that [Dives] 
requested Lazarus to be sent to relieve him-[Lazarus], on whom he did not 
[formerly] bestow even the crumbs [which fell] from his table. [He tells us] 
also of the answer given by Abraham, who was acquainted not only with what 
respected himself, but Dives also, and who enjoined those who did not wish to 
come into that place of torment to believe Moses and the prophets, and to 
receive
the preaching of Him who was
to rise again from the dead. By these things, then, it is plainly declared that 
souls continue to exist that they do not pass from body to body, that they 
possess the form of a man, so that they may be recognised, and retain the memory 
of things in this world; moreover, that the gift of prophecy was possessed by 
Abraham, and that each class of souls] receives a habitation such as it has 
deserved, even before the judgment.
2. But if any persons at this point maintain that those souls, which only 
began a little while ago to exist, cannot endure for any length of time; but 
that they must, on the one hand, either be unborn, in order that they may be 
immortal, or if they have had a beginning in the way of generation, that they 
should die with the body itself-let them learn that God alone, who is Lord of 
all, is without beginning and without end, being truly and for ever the same, 
and always remaining the same unchangeable Being. But all things which proceed 
from Him, whatsoever have been made, and are made, do indeed receive their own 
beginning of generation, and on this account are inferior to Him who formed 
them, inasmuch as they are not unbegotten. Nevertheless they endure, and extend 
their existence into a long series of ages in accordance with the will of God 
their Creator; so that He grants them that they should be thus formed at the 
beginning, and that they should so exist afterwards.
3. For as the heaven which is above us, the firmament, the sun, the moon, the 
rest of the stars, and all their grandeur, although they had no previous 
existence, were called into being, and continue throughout a long course of time 
according to the will of God, so also any one who thinks thus respecting souls 
and spirits, and, in fact, respecting all created things, will not by any means 
go far astray, inasmuch as all things that have been made had a beginning when 
they were formed, but endure as long as God wills that they should have an 
existence and continuance. The prophetic Spirit bears testimony to these 
opinions, when He declares, "For He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and 
they were created: He hath established them for ever, yea, forever and 
ever."
And again, He thus speaks respecting the salvation of man: "He asked life of 
Thee, and Thou gavest him length of days for ever and ever; "
indicating that it is the Father of all who imparts continuance for ever and 
ever on those who are saved. For life does not arise from us, nor from our own 
nature; but it is bestowed according to the grace of God. And therefore he who 
shall preserve the life bestowed upon him, and give thanks to Him who imparted 
it, shall receive also length of days for ever and ever. But he who shall reject 
it, and prove himself ungrateful to his Maker, inasmuch as he has been created, 
and has not recognised Him who bestowed [the gift upon him], deprives himself of 
[the privilege of] continuance for ever and ever.
And, for this reason, the Lord declared to those who showed themselves 
ungrateful towards Him: "If ye have not been faithful in that which is little, 
who will give you that which is great? "
indicating that those who, in this brief temporal life, have shown themselves 
ungrateful to Him who bestowed it, shall justly not receive from Him length of 
days for ever and ever.
4. But as the animal body is certainly not itself the soul, yet has 
fellowship with the soul as long as God pleases; so the soul herself is not 
life, but partakes in that life bestowed upon her by God. Wherefore also the prophetic 
word declares of the first-formed man, "He became a living soul,"
teaching us that by the participation of life the soul became alive; so that the 
soul, and the life which it possesses, must be understood as being separate 
existences. When God therefore bestows life and perpetual duration, it comes to 
pass that even souls which did not previously exist should henceforth endure 
[for ever], since God has both willed that they should exist, and should 
continue in existence. For the will of God ought to govern and rule in all 
things, while all other things give way to Him, are in subjection, and devoted 
to His service. Thus far, then, let me speak concerning the creation and the 
continued duration of the soul.

Chapter XXXV.-Refutation of 
  Basilides, and of the Opinion that the Prophets Uttered Their Predictions 
  Under the Inspiration of Different Gods.
1. Moreover, in addition to what has been said, Basilides himself will, 
according to his own principles, find it necessary to maintain not only that 
there are three hundred and sixty-five heavens made in succession by one 
another, but that an immense and innumerable multitude of heavens have always 
been in the process of being made, and are being made, and will continue to be 
made, so that the formation of heavens of this kind can never cease. For if from 
the efflux
of the first heaven the second was made after its likeness, and the third after 
the likeness of the second, and so on with all the remaining subsequent ones, 
then it follows, as a matter of necessity, that from the efflux of our heaven, 
which he indeed terms the last, another be formed like to it, and from that 
again a third; and thus there can never cease, either the process of efflux from 
those heavens which have been already made, or the manufacture of [new] heavens, 
but the operation must go on ad infinitum, and give rise to a number of 
heavens which will be altogether indefinite.
2. The remainder of those who are falsely termed Gnostics, and who maintain 
that the prophets uttered their prophecies under the inspiration of different 
gods, will be easily overthrown by this fact, that all the prophets proclaimed 
one God and Lord, and that the very Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things 
which are therein; while they moreover announced the advent of His Son, as I 
shall demonstrate from the Scriptures themselves, in the books which follow.
3. If, however, any object that, in the Hebrew language, diverse expressions 
[to represent God] occur in the Scriptures, such as Sabaoth, Elo&eumlaut;, Adonai, and all other such terms, striving to prove 
from these that there are different powers and gods, let them learn that all 
expressions of this kind are but announcements and appellations of one and the 
same Being. For the term <i>elo-eumlaut;</i> in the Jewish language denotes 
God, while <i>elo√Éeim</i> 
and <i>elo√Éeuth</i> in the Hebrew language signify 
"that which contains all." As to the appellation <i>adonai, sometimes it denotes what is 
nameable
and admirable; but at other times, when the letter <i>daleth in it is doubled, and the word 
receives an initial 
guttural sound-thus Addonai-[it signifies], "One who bounds and separates the 
land from the water," so that the water should not subsequently 
submerge the land. In like manner also, <i>sabaoth, 
when it is spelled by a Greek Omega in the last syllable [Sabao¬µth], denotes "a voluntary agent; "but 
when it is spelled with a Greek Omicron-as, for instance, Sabao√°√£th-it expresses "the first heaven." In 
the same way, too, the word <i>jao√Éth</i>, 
when the last syllable is made long and aspirated, denotes "a predetermined 
measure; "but when it is written shortly by the Greek letter Omicron, namely 
<i>jao√®th</i>, it signifies "one who puts evils 
to flight." All the other expressions likewise bring out
the title of one and the same Being; as, for example (in English
), The Lord of Powers, The Father of all, God Almighty, The Most High, The 
Creator, The Maker, and such like. These are not the names and titles of a 
succession of different beings, but of one and the same, by means of which the 
one God and Father is revealed, He who contains all things, and grants to all 
the boon of existence.
4. Now, that the preaching of the apostles, the authoritative teaching of the 
Lord, the announcements of the prophets, the dictated utterances of the 
apostles,
and the ministration of the law-all of which praise one and the same Being, the 
God and Father of all, and not many diverse beings, nor one deriving his 
substance from different gods or powers, but [declare] that all things [were 
formed] by one and the same Father (who nevertheless adapts this works] to the 
natures and tendencies of the materials dealt with), things visible and 
invisible, and, in short, all things that have been made [were created] neither 
by angels, nor by any other power, but by God alone, the Father-are all in 
harmony with our statements, has, I think, been sufficiently proved, while by 
these weighty arguments it has been shown that there is but one God, the Maker 
of all things. But that I may not be thought to avoid that series of proofs 
which may be derived from the Scriptures of the Lord (since, indeed, these 
Scriptures do much more evidently and clearly proclaim this very point), I 
shall, for the benefit of those at least who do not bring a depraved mind to 
bear upon them, devote a special book to the Scriptures referred to, which shall 
fairly follow them out [and explain them], and I shall plainly set forth from 
these divine Scriptures proofs to [satisfy] all the lovers of truth.
