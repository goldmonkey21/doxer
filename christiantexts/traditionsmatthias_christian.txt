The Traditions of Matthias








Clement 
                  of Alexandria, 
                  Stromata 2.9.45.4

But the begining 
                  of this is to marvel at things, as Plato says in the Theatetus 
                  and as Matthias says in the Traditions when he urges, 
                  "Marvel at what is present," laying this down as the 
                  first step toward the knowledge of things beyond. 
 
Clement 
                  of Alexandria, 
                  Stromata 3.4.26.3
They say that Matthias 
                  also taught this: "To fight with the flesh and misuse it, 
                  without yielding to it through undisciplined pleasure, so to 
                  increase the soul through faith and knowledge."
 
Clement 
                  of Alexandria, 
                  Stromata 4.6.35.2
So 
                  Zaccheus whom they call Matthias, the chief tax collector, when 
                  he had heard that the Lord had esteemed him highly enough to 
                  be with him, said, "Behold, half of my present possessions 
                  I give as alms, and Lord, if I ever extorted money from anyone 
                  in any way, I return it fourfold."
At 
                  this the savior said, "When the son of man came today, 
                  he found that which was lost."
 
Clement 
                  of Alexandria, 
                  Stromata 7.13.82.1
They 
                  say that Matthias the apostle in the Traditions says 
                  at every opportunity, "If the neighbor of an elect person 
                  sins, the elect person sins. For if he had led himself as the 
                  word dictates, the neighbor would have been in awe of his life 
                  so that he did not sin."
