But as for the thirteenth seal, I have established it, together with the summit of
      knowledge and the certainty of rest. The first and the second and the third are the
      worldly and the material. I have informed you concerning these, that you should [...] your
      bodies. And a sense-perceptible power will [...] those who will rest, and they will be
      kept from passion and division of the union. 
The fourth and the fifth, which are above, these you have come to know [...] divine. He
      exists after the [...] and the nature of the [...], that is, the one who [...] three. And
      I have informed you of [...] in the three [...] by these two. I have informed you
      concerning it, that it is incorporeal ... (1 line unrecoverable) ... and after
      [...] within [...] every [...] which [...] your [...]. The fifth, concerning the
      conversion of those that are within me, and concerning those who dwell in that place. 
But the sixth, concerning the self-begotten ones, concerning the incorporeal being
      which exists partially, together with those who exist in the truth of the All [...] for
      understanding and assurance. And the seventh, concerning the self-begotten power, which is
      the third perfect [...] fourth, concerning salvation and wisdom. And the eighth,
      concerning the mind, which is male, which appeared in the beginning, and (concerning) the
      being which is incorporeal and the intelligible world. The ninth, [...] of the power which
      appeared in the beginning. The tenth, concerning Barbelo, the virgin [...] of the Aeon.
      The eleventh and the twelfth speak of the Invisible One who possesses three powers, and
      the Spirit which does not have being, belonging to the first Unbegotten (fem.). The
      thirteenth speaks concerning the Silent One who was not known, and the primacy of the one
      who was not distinguished. 
For I am he who has understood that which truly exists, whether partially or wholly,
      according to difference and sameness, that they exist from the beginning in the entire
      place which is eternal, <i.e.> all those that have come into existence, whether
      without being or with being, those who are unbegotten, and the divine aeons, together with
      the angels, and the souls which are without guile, and the soul-garments, the likenesses
      of the simple ones. And afterwards, they have been mixed with [...] them. But still [...]
      the entire being [...] which imitates the incorporeal being and the unsubstantial (fem.).
      Finally the entire defilement was saved, together with the immortality of the former
      (fem.). I have deliberated, and have attained to the boundary of the sense-perceptible
      world. <I have come to know> part by part the entire place of the incorporeal being,
      and <I> have come to know the intelligible world. <I have come to know>, when
      <I> was deliberating, whether in every respect the sense-perceptible world is worthy
      of being saved entirely. 
For I have not ceased speaking of the Self-begotten One, O [...] became [...] part by
      part the entire place. He descended; again he descended <from> the Unbegotten One
      who does not have being, who is the Spirit. That one who exists before all of them reaches
      to the divine Self-engendered One. The one having being searches [...] and he exists [...]
      and he is like [...] and from [...] dividing [...] I became [...] for many, as it is
      manifest that he save a multitude. 
But after all of these things, I am seeking the kingdom of the Three-Powered One, which
      has no beginning. Whence did he appear and act to fill the entire place with his power?
      And in what way did the unbegotten ones come into existence, since they were not begotten?
      And what are the differences among the aeons? And as for those who are unbegotten, how
      many are they? And in what respect do they differ from each other? 
When I had inquired about these things, I perceived that he had worked from silence. He
      exists from the beginning among those that truly exist, that belong to the One who exists.
      There is another, existing from the beginning, belonging to the One who works within the
      Silent One. And the silence [...] him works. For as much as this one [...], that one works
      from the silence which belongs to the Unbegotten One among the aeons, and from the
      beginning he does not have being. But the energy of that One <is> the Three-Powered
      One, the One unbegotten before the Aeon, not having being. And it is possible to behold
      the supremacy of the silence of the Silent One, i.e., the supremacy of the energy of the
      Three-Powered. And the One who exists, who is silent, who is above the heaven [...],
      revealed the Three-Powered, First-Perfect One. 
When he [...] to the powers, they rejoiced. Those that are within me were perfected
      together with all the rest. And they all blessed the Three-Powered, one by one, who is the
      First-Perfect One, blessing him in purity, everywhere praising the Lord, who exists before
      the All, [...] the Three-Powered. [...] their worship [...] myself, and I will still go on
      inquiring how they had become silent. I will understand a power which I hold in honor. 
The third power of the Three-powered, when it (fem.) had perceived him, said to me,
      "Be silent in order that you might know; run, and come before me. But know that this
      One was silent, and obtain understanding." For the power is attending to me, leading
      me into the Aeon which is Barbelo, the male Virgin. 
For this reason the Virgin became male, because she had been divided from the male. The
      Knowledge stood outside of him, because it belongs to him. And she who exists, she who
      sought, possesses (it), just as the Three-Powered One possesses (it). She withdrew from
      them, from these two powers, since she exists outside of the Great One, as she [...] who
      is above [...], who is silent, who has this commandment to be silent. His knowledge and
      his hypostasis and his activity are those things of which the power of the Three-Powered
      spoke, <saying>, "We all have withdrawn to ourselves. We have become silent,
      and when we came to know him, that is, the Three-Powered, we bowed down; we [...]; we
      blessed him [...] upon us." [...]. 
[...] the invisible Spirit ran up to his place. The whole place was revealed; the whole
      place unfolded <until> he reached the upper region. Again he departed; he caused the
      whole place to be illuminated, and the whole place was illuminated. And you (pl.) have
      been given the third part of the spirit of the power of the One who possesses the three
      powers. Blessed is [...]. He said, "O you who dwell in these places, it is necessary
      for you to know those that are higher than these, and tell them to the powers. For you
      (sg.) will become elect with the elect ones in the last times, as the invisible Spirits
      runs up above. And you yourselves, run with him up above, since you have the great crown
      which [...]. 
But on the day [...] will beckon [...] run up above [...] and the sense-perceptible
      [...] visible [...] and they ...

      animals. Some among them are polymorphous, and, contrary to nature, they have for their
      names which [...]. They are divided and [...] according to the [...] and [...] in form
      [...]. But these that are aspects of sound according to the third originate from being.
      And concerning these, all of these (remarks) are sufficient, since we have (already)
      spoken about them. 
For this division takes place again in these regions in the manner we have mentioned
      from the beginning. However, the soul, on the other hand, has different shape<s>.
      The shape of the soul exists in this form, i.e., (the soul) that came into existence of
      its own accord. The shape is the second spherical part, while the first allows it, eEiou,
      the self-begotten soul, aeEiouO. The second schema, eEiou, ... by those
      having two sounds (diphthongs), the first being placed after them ... 
... (3 lines unrecoverable)
      ... the light. 
Control yourselves, receive the imperishable seed, bear fruit, and do not become
      attached to your possessions. 
But know that the oxytones exist among the vowels, and the diphthongs which are next to
      them. But the short are inferior, and the [...] are [...] by them. Those that [...], since
      they are intermediate [...]. The sounds of the semivowels are superior to the voiceless
      (consonants). And those that are double are superior to the semivowels, which do not
      change. But the aspirates are better than the inaspirates (of) the voiceless (consonants).
      And those that are intermediate will accept their combination in which they are; they are
      ignorant of the things that are good. They (the vowels) are combined with the
      intermediates, which are less. Form by form, <they constitute> the nomenclature of
      the gods and the angels, not because they are mixed with each other according to every
      form, but only (because) they have a good function. It did not happen that <their>
      will was revealed. 
Do not keep on sinning, and do not dare to make use of sin. 
But I am speaking to you (sg.) concerning the three [...] shapes of the soul. The third
      shape of the soul is [...] is a spherical one, put after it, from the simple vowels: eee,
      iii, ooo, uuu, OOO. The diphthongs were as follows: ai, au, ei, eu, Eu, ou, Ou, oi,
      Ei, ui, Oi, auei, euEu, oiou, ggg, ggg, ggg, aiau, eieu, Eu, oiou, Ou, ggg, ggg, aueieu,
      oiou, Eu, three times for a male soul. The third shape is spherical. The second shape,
      being put after it, has two sounds. The male soul's third shape (consists) of the simple
      vowels: aaa, eee, EEE, iii, ooo, uuu, OOO, OOO, OOO. And this shape is different
      from the first, but they resemble each other, and they make some ordinary sounds of this
      sort: aeEoO. And from these (are made) the diphthongs. 
So also the fourth and the fifth. With regard to them, they were not allowed to reveal
      the whole topic, but only those things that are apparent. You (pl.) were taught about
      them, that you should perceive them, in order that they, too, might all seek and find who
      they are, either by themselves alone [...], or by each other, or to reveal destinies that
      have been determined from the beginning, either with reference to themselves alone, or
      with reference to one another, just as they exist with each other in sound, whether
      partially or formally. 
They are commanded to submit, for their part is generated and formal. (They are
      commanded) either by the long (vowels), or by those of dual time value, or by the short
      (vowels), which are small [...], or the oxytones, or the intermediates, or the barytones. 
And consonants exist with the vowels, and individually they are commanded and they
      submit. The constitute the nomenclature of the angels. And the consonants are
      self-existent, and as they are changed, <they> submit to the hidden gods by means of
      beat and pitch and silence and impulse. They summon the semivowels, all of which submit to
      them with one accord, since it is only the unchanging double (consonants) that coexist
      with the semivowels. 
But the aspirates and the inaspirates and the intermediates constitute the voiceless
      (consonants). Again [...] they are combined with each other, and they are separate from
      one another. They are commanded and they submit, and they constitute an ignorant
      nomenclature. And they become one or two or three or four or five or six, up to seven,
      having a simple sound, <together with> these which have two sounds, [...] the place
      of the seventeen consonants. Among the first names, some are less. And since these do not
      have being, either they are an aspect of being, or they divide the nature of the mind,
      which is masculine, (and) which is intermediate. 
And you (sg.) put in those that resemble each other with the vowels and the consonants.
      Some are: bagadazatha, begedezethe, bEgEdEzEthE, bigidizithi, bogodozotho, buguduzuthu,
      bOgOdOzOthO. And the rest [...] babebEbibobubO. But the rest are different: abebEbibob,
      in order that you (sg.) might collect them, and be separated from the angels. 
And there will be some effects. The first (fem.), which is good, is from the triad. It
      [...] has need of ... (1 line unrecoverable) ... their shapes. <The> dyad and
      the monad do not resemble anything, but they are first to exist. The dyad, being divided,
      is divided from the monad, and it belongs to the hypostasis. But the tetrad received (the)
      elements, and the pentad received concord, and the hexad was perfected by itself. The
      hebdomad received beauty, and the ogdoad received [...] ready ... (1 line
      unrecoverable) ... greatly. And the decad revealed the whole place. But the eleven and
      the twelve have traversed [...] not having [...] it is higher [...] seven ... 
... (9 lines virtually unrecoverable)
      ... promise that [...] begin to separate them by means of a mark and a point, the one
      which quarrels from the one which is an enemy. 
Thus [...] of being ... (1 line unrecoverable) ... the letters [...] in a holy
      or according to a bond existing separately. And <they> exist with each other in
      generation or in birth. And according to [...] generation, they do not have [...] these
      ... 
... (10 lines unrecoverable)
      ... one [...] speaking the riddle. 
Because within the sense-perceptible world there exists the temple, which measures
      seven hundred cubits, and a river, which [...] within [...] for ever, they [...] three
      [...] to the four [...] seals [...] clouds, and the waters, and the forms of the wax
      images, and some emerald likenesses. 
For the rest, I will teach you (sg.) about them. This is the generation of the names.
      That (fem.) which was not generated [...] from the beginning ...

      ... time(s), when confined, when spread out, when diminished. But there exists the gentle
      word, and there exists another word which approaches, being [...] in this manner ... (1

      [...] the undivided beings, and the power [...] having a share in the joy separately and

      and the incorporeal ones. 
This is the word of the hypostasis that one should [...] in this way: if [...] with
      their [...] helping those who stir up the [...] manifest [...]. If one knows him, he will
      call upon him. 
But there are words, some of which are two, but others existing separately ... 
... (10 lines virtually unrecoverable)
      ... or according to those that have duration. And these either are separate from them, or
      they are joined to one another or with themselves, either the diphthongs, or the simple
      vowels, or every [...] or [...] or [...] exist just as [...] exist [...] the consonants
      [...] they exist individually until they are divided and doubled. Some have the power
      [...] according the letters that are consonants ...

      and once for the entire place, and with ignorance for those which are subject to change
      [...] which became [...] together with the entire place [...] finally. 
And [...] they all [...] they are hidden, but they were pronounced openly. They did not
      stop without being revealed, nor did they stop without naming the angels. The vowels join
      the consonants, whether without or within, [...] they said [...] teach you (sg.) [...]
      again for ever. They were counted four times, (and) they were engendered three times, and
      they became ... 
... (2 lines unrecoverable)
      For these reasons, we have acquired sufficiency; for it is fitting that each one acquire
      power for himself to bear fruit, and that we never cast aspersions on the mysteries [...]

      hypostasis. 
And the reward which will be provided for such a one is salvation. But the opposite

      will be in a [...] in a ...

      about an exalted power, and a divine knowledge, and a might which cannot be resisted. But
      you shall examine who is worthy that he should reveal them, knowing that those who commit
      sin [...] down to [...] as they [...] the Father [...] that which is fitting. Do not
      desire to give power to the sense-perceptible world. Are you (pl.) not attending to me,
      who have received salvation from the intelligible world? But (as for) these <words>
