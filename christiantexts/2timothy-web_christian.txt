2 Timothy. Pauls Second Letter to Timothy 

1:1Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through 
the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, 
1:2to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, 
mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
1:3I thank God, whom I serve as my 
forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my 
petitions, night and day 1:4longing to see you, remembering your 
tears, that I may be filled with joy; 1:5having been reminded of the unfeigned 
faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your 
mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also. 
1:6For this cause, I remind you that you 
should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my 
hands. 1:7For God didn't give us a spirit of fear, 
but of power, love, and self-control. 1:8Therefore don't be ashamed of the 
testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the 
Gospel according to the power of God, 1:9who saved us and called us with a holy 
calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, 
which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, 1:10but has now been 
revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and 
brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel. 1:11For this, I was 
appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 1:12For this cause I suffer also these 
things. 
Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded 
that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day. 
1:13Hold the pattern of sound words which 
you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 1:14That good thing which was committed to 
you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. 
1:15This you know, that all who are in Asia 
turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 1:16May the Lord grant 
mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not 
ashamed of my chain, 1:17but when he was in Rome, he sought me 
diligently, and found me 1:18(the Lord grant to him to find the 
Lord's mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know 
very well. 
2:1You therefore, my child, be strengthened 
in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 2:2The things which you have heard from me 
among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach 
others also. 2:3You therefore must endure hardship, as a 
good soldier of Christ Jesus. 2:4No soldier on service entangles himself 
in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. 2:5Also, if anyone competes in athletics, 
he isn't crowned unless he has competed by the rules. 2:6The farmers who 
labor must be the first to get a share of the crops. 2:7Consider what I say, 
and may the Lord give you understanding in all things. 
2:8Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the 
dead, of the seed of David, according to my Gospel, 2:9in which I suffer 
hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained. 2:10Therefore I endure all things for the 
chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ 
Jesus with eternal glory. 2:11This saying is faithful: 
 For if we died with him,      We will 
also live with him. 
 2:12If we 
endure,      We will also reign with him. 
 If we deny him,      He also will 
deny us. 
 2:13If we are 
faithless,      He remains faithful. He can't 
deny himself. 
2:14Remind them of these things, charging 
them in the sight of the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit, 
to the subverting of those who hear. 
2:15Give diligence to present yourself 
approved by God, a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly handling the 
Word of Truth. 2:16But shun empty chatter, for they will 
proceed further in ungodliness, 2:17and their word will consume like 
gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 2:18men who have erred 
concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and 
overthrowing the faith of some. 2:19However God's firm foundation stands, 
having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let every one who 
names the name of the 
Lord depart from unrighteousness." 2:20Now in a great house there are not only 
vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, 
and some for dishonor. 2:21If anyone therefore purges himself from 
these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's 
use, prepared for every good work. 
2:22Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue 
righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a 
pure heart. 2:23But refuse foolish and ignorant 
questionings, knowing that they generate strife. 2:24The Lord's servant 
must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient, 2:25in 
gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance 
leading to a full knowledge of the truth, 2:26and they may 
recover themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to 
his will. 
3:1But know this, that in the last days, 
grievous times will come. 3:2For men will be lovers of self, lovers 
of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, 
unholy, 3:3without natural affection, unforgiving, 
slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good, 3:4traitors, 
headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; 3:5holding a form of godliness, but having 
denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also. 3:6For of these are 
those who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with 
sins, led away by various lusts, 3:7always learning, and never able to come 
to the knowledge of the truth. 3:8Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed 
Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate 
concerning the faith. 3:9But they will proceed no further. For 
their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be. 3:10But you did follow my teaching, 
conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, 3:11persecutions, and 
sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I 
endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me. 3:12Yes, and all who desire to live godly 
in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 3:13But evil men and impostors will grow 
worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 3:14But you remain in 
the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom 
you have learned them. 3:15From infancy, you have known the sacred 
writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is 
in Christ Jesus. 3:16Every writing inspired by God is 
profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction which 
is in righteousness, 3:17that the man of God may be complete, 
thoroughly equipped for every good work. 
4:1I charge you therefore before God and 
the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing 
and his Kingdom: 4:2preach the word; be urgent in season and 
out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching. 4:3For 
the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having 
itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts; 4:4and 
will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables. 4:5But 
you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and 
fulfill your ministry. 
4:6For I am already being offered, and the 
time of my departure has come. 4:7I have fought the good fight. I have 
finished the course. I have kept the faith. 4:8From now on, there 
is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous 
judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those 
who have loved his appearing. 4:9Be diligent to come to me soon, 4:10for Demas left me, having loved this 
present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to 
Dalmatia. 4:11Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and 
bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministering. 4:12But I sent Tychicus 
to Ephesus. 4:13Bring the cloak that I left at Troas 
with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments. 4:14Alexander, the coppersmith, did much 
evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works, 4:15of whom you also 
must beware; for he greatly opposed our words. 
4:16At my first defense, no one came to 
help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them. 4:17But the Lord stood 
by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully 
proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the 
mouth of the lion. 4:18And the Lord will deliver me from every 
evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory 
forever and ever. Amen. 
4:19Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house 
of Onesiphorus. 4:20Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left 
Trophimus at Miletus sick. 4:21Be diligent to come before winter. 
Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. 4:22The Lord Jesus Christ be with your 
spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
