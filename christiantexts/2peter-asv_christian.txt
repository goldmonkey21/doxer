2 Peter. The Second Epistle General of Peter 

1:1Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of 
Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained a like precious faith with us in the 
righteousness of our God and the Saviour Jesus Christ: 1:2Grace to you and 
peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; 1:3seeing that his divine power hath 
granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the 
knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue; 1:4whereby he hath 
granted unto us his precious and exceeding great promises; that through these ye 
may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption 
that is in that world by lust. 1:5Yea, and for this very cause adding on 
your part all diligence, in your faith supply virtue; and in your virtue 
knowledge; 1:6and in your knowledge 
self-control; and in your self-control patience; and in your 
patience godliness; 1:7and in your godliness brotherly 
kindness; and in your brotherly kindness love. 1:8For if these things 
are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the 
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1:9For he that lacketh these things is 
blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old 
sins. 1:10Wherefore, brethren, give the more 
diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye 
shall never stumble: 1:11for thus shall be richly supplied unto 
you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 
1:12Wherefore I shall be ready always to 
put you in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and are established 
in the truth which is with you. 1:13And I think it right, as long as I am 
in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; 1:14knowing that the putting off of my 
tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified unto me. 1:15Yea, I will give diligence that at 
every time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance. 
1:16For we did not follow cunningly devised 
fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 1:17For he received 
from God the Father honor and glory, when there was borne such a voice to him by 
the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: 1:18and this voice we ourselves 
heard borne out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount. 1:19And we have the word of prophecy 
made more sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp 
shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your 
hearts: 1:20knowing this first, that no prophecy of 
scripture is of private interpretation. 1:21For no prophecy ever came by the will 
of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit. 

2:1But there arose false prophets also 
among the people, as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall 
privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought them, 
bringing upon themselves swift destruction. 2:2And many shall 
follow their lascivious doings; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be 
evil spoken of. 2:3And in covetousness shall they with 
feigned words make merchandise of you: whose sentence now from of old lingereth 
not, and their destruction slumbereth not. 2:4For if God spared 
not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed them to 
pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; 2:5and spared not the 
ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of 
righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; 2:6and 
turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an 
overthrow, having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly; 2:7and 
delivered righteous Lot, sore distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked 2:8(for 
that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his 
righteous soul from day to day with their lawless deeds): 2:9the 
Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the 
unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment; 2:10but chiefly them 
that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion. 
Daring, self-willed, they tremble not to rail at dignities: 2:11whereas angels, 
though greater in might and power, bring not a railing judgment against them 
before the Lord. 2:12But these, as creatures without reason, 
born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are 
ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed, 2:13suffering wrong as 
the hire of wrong-doing; men that count it pleasure to revel in the 
day-time, spots and blemishes, revelling in their deceivings while they feast 
with you; 2:14having eyes full of adultery, and that 
cannot cease from sin; enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart exercised in 
covetousness; children of cursing; 2:15forsaking the right way, they went 
astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the 
hire of wrong-doing; 2:16but he was rebuked for his own 
transgression: a dumb ass spake with man's voice and stayed the madness of the 
prophet. 2:17These are springs without water, and 
mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved. 
2:18For, uttering great swelling 
words of vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by 
lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from them that live in error; 2:19promising them liberty, while they 
themselves are bondservants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the 
same is he also brought into bondage. 2:20For if, after they have escaped the 
defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus 
Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become 
worse with them than the first. 2:21For it were better for them not to have 
known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the 
holy commandment delivered unto them. 2:22It has happened unto them according to 
the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had 
washed to wallowing in the mire. 

3:1This is now, beloved, the second epistle 
that I write unto you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by 
putting you in remembrance; 3:2that ye should remember the words which 
were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of the Lord and 
Saviour through your apostles: 3:3knowing this first, that in the last 
days mockers shall come with mockery, walking after their own lusts, 3:4and 
saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for, from the day that the fathers 
fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the 
creation. 3:5For this they willfully forget, that 
there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst 
water, by the word of God; 3:6by which means the world that then was, 
being overflowed with water, perished: 3:7but the heavens that now are, and the 
earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the 
day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. 3:8But forget not this 
one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a 
thousand years as one day. 3:9The Lord is not slack concerning his 
promise, as some count slackness; but is longsuffering to you-ward, not wishing 
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 3:10But the day of the Lord will come as a 
thief; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the 
elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that 
are therein shall be burned up. 3:11Seeing that these things are thus all 
to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy living 
and godliness, 3:12looking for and earnestly desiring the 
coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire shall be 
dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? 3:13But, according to 
his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth 
righteousness. 3:14Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look 
for these things, give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot and 
blameless in his sight. 3:15And account that the longsuffering of 
our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the 
wisdom given to him, wrote unto you; 3:16as also in all his epistles, 
speaking in them of these things; wherein are some things hard to be understood, 
which the ignorant and unstedfast wrest, as they do also the other 
scriptures, unto their own destruction. 3:17Ye therefore, beloved, knowing these 
things beforehand, beware lest, being carried away with the error of the 
wicked, ye fall from your own stedfastness. 3:18But grow in the 
grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be the 
glory both now and for ever. Amen.
