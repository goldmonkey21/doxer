Titus











Paulâ€™s Letter to Titus 

1:1Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle 
of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the knowledge 
of the truth which is according to godliness, 1:2in hope of eternal 
life, which God, who can't lie, promised before eternal times; 1:3but 
in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted 
according to the commandment of God our Savior; 1:4to Titus, my true 
child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father 
and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. 
1:5I left you in Crete for this reason, 
that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in 
every city, as I directed you; 1:6if anyone is blameless, the husband of 
one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly 
behavior. 1:7For the overseer must be blameless, as 
God's steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not 
violent, not greedy for dishonest gain; 1:8but given to hospitality, as a lover of 
good, sober-minded, fair, holy, self-controlled; 1:9holding to the 
faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort 
in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him. 1:10For there are also many unruly men, 
vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, 1:11whose mouths must be stopped; men who 
overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest 
gain's sake. 1:12One of them, a prophet of their own, 
said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons." 1:13This testimony is true. For this cause, 
reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 1:14not paying 
attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. 
1:15To the pure, all things are pure; but 
to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind 
and their conscience are defiled. 1:16They profess that they know God, but by 
their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good 
work. 
2:1But say the things which fit sound 
doctrine, 2:2that older men should be temperate, 
sensible, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience: 2:3and 
that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved 
to much wine, teachers of that which is good; 2:4that they may train 
the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 2:5to 
be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own 
husbands, that God's word may not be blasphemed. 2:6Likewise, exhort the 
younger men to be sober-minded; 2:7in all things showing yourself an 
example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, 
incorruptibility, 2:8and soundness of speech that can't be 
condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say 
about us. 2:9Exhort servants to be in subjection to 
their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting; 2:10not stealing, but showing all good 
fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things. 2:11For the grace of God has appeared, 
bringing salvation to all men, 2:12instructing us to the intent that, 
denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and 
godly in this present world; 2:13looking for the blessed hope and 
appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ; 2:14who gave himself for us, that he might 
redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own 
possession, zealous for good works. 2:15Say these things and exhort and reprove 
with all authority. Let no man despise you. 
3:1Remind them to be in subjection to 
rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, 3:2to 
speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility 
toward all men. 3:3For we were also once foolish, 
disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and 
envy, hateful, and hating one another. 3:4But when the kindness of God our Savior 
and his love toward mankind appeared, 3:5not by works of righteousness, which we 
did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of 
regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, 3:6which he poured out 
on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior; 3:7that, being 
justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal 
life. 3:8This saying is faithful, and concerning 
these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have 
believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and 
profitable to men; 3:9but shun foolish questionings, 
genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and 
vain. 3:10Avoid a factious man after a first and 
second warning; 3:11knowing that such a one is perverted, 
and sins, being self-condemned. 
3:12When I send Artemas to you, or 
Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to 
winter there. 3:13Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on 
their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them. 3:14Let our people also learn to maintain 
good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. 
3:15All who are with me greet you. Greet 
those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
