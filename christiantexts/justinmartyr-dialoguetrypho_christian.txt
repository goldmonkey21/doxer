ST. JUSTIN MARTYR DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO 
CHAPTER I -- INTRODUCTION 
While I was going about one morning in the walks of the Xystus, a certain 
man, with others in his company, having met me, and said, "Hail, O philosopher!" 
And immediately after saying this, he turned round and walked along with me; his 
friends likewise followed him. And I in turn having addressed him, said, "What 
is there important?" 
And he replied, "I was instructed," says he, "by Corinthus the Socratic in 
Argos, that I ought not to despise or treat with indifference those who array 
themselves in this dress, but to show them all kindness, and to associate with 
them, as perhaps some advantage would spring from the intercourse either to some 
such man or to myself. It is good, moreover, for both, if either the one or the 
other be benefited. On this account, therefore, whenver I see any one in such 
costume, I gladly approach him, and now, for the same reason, have I willingly 
accosted you; and these accompany me, in the expectation of hearing for 
themselves something profitable from you." 
"But who are you, most excellent man?" So I replied to him in jest. 
Then he told me frankly both his name and his family. "Trypho," says he, "I 
am called; and I am a Hebrew of the circumcision, and having escaped from the 
war lately carried on there, I am spending my days in Greece, and chiefly at 
Corinth." 
And in what," said I, "would you be profited by philosophy so much as by your 
own lawgiver and the prophets?" 
Why not?" he replied. "Do no the philosophers turn every discourse on God? 
And do not questions continually arise to them about His unity and providence? 
Is not this truly the duty of philophy, to investigate the Deity?" "Assuredly," 
said I, "so we too have believed. But the most have not taken thought of this, 
whether there be one or more gods, and whether they have a regard for each one 
of us or not, as if this knowledge contributed nothing to our happiness; nay, 
they moreover attempt to persuade us that God takes care of the universe with 
its genera and species, but not of me and you, and each individually, since 
otherwise we would surely not need to pray to Him night and day. But it is not 
difficult to understand the upshot of this; for fearlessness and license in 
speaking result to such as maintain these opinions, doing and saying whatever 
they choose, neither dreading punishment nor hoping for any benefit from God. 
For how could they? They affirm that the same things shall always happen; and, 
further, that I and you shall again live in like manner, having become neither 
better men nor worse. But there are some others, who, having supposed the soul 
to be immortal and immaterial, believe that though they have committed evil they 
will not suffer punishment (for that which is immaterial is insensible), and 
that the soul, in consequence of its immortality, needs nothing from God." 
And he, smiling gently, said, "Tell us your opinion of these matters, and 
what idea you entertain respecting God, and what you philosophy is." 
CHAPTER II -- JUSTIN DESCRIBES HIS STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY. 
"I will tell you," said I, "what seems to me; for philosophy is, in fact, the 
greatest possession, and most honourable before God, to whom it leads us and 
alone commends us; and these are truly holy men who have bestowed attention on 
philosophy. What philosophy is, however, and the reason why it has been sent 
down to men, have escaped the observation of most; for there would be neither 
Platonists, nor Stoics, nor Peripatetics, nor Theoretics, nor Pythagoreans, this 
knowledge being one. I wish to tell you why it has become many-headed. It 
has happened that those who first handled it [i.e., philosophy], and who were 
therefore esteemed illustrious men, were succeeded by those who made no 
investigations concerning truth, but only admired the perseverance and 
self-discipline of the former, as well as the novelty of the doctrines; and each 
thought that to be true which he learned from his teacher: then, moreover, those 
latter persons handed down to their successors such things, and others similar 
to them; and this system was called by the name of him who was styled the father 
of the doctrine. Being at first desirous of personally conversing with one of 
these men, I surrendered myself to a certain Stoic; and having spent a 
considerable time with him, when I had not acquired any further knowledge of God 
(for he did not know himself, and said such instruction was unnecessary), I left 
him and betook myself to another, who was called a Peripatetic, and as he 
fancied, shrewd. And this man, after having entertained me for the first few 
days, requested me to settle the fee, in order that our intercourse might not be 
unprofitable. Him, too, for this reason I abandoned, believing him to be no 
philosopher at all. But when my soul was eagerly desirous to hear the peculiar 
and choice philosophy, I came to a Pythagorean, very celebrated--a man who 
thought much of his own wisdom. And then, when I had an interview with him, 
willing to become his hearer and disciple, he said, 'What then? Are you 
acquainted with music, astronomy, and geometry? Do you expect to perceive any of 
those things which conduce to a happy life, if you have not been first informed 
on those points which wean the soul from sensible objects, and render it fitted 
for objects which appertain to the mind, so that it can contemplate that which 
is honourable in its essence and that which is good in its essence?' Having 
commended many of these branches of learning, and telling me that they were 
necessary, he dismissed me when I confessed to him my ignorance. Accordingly I 
took it rather impatiently, as was to be expected when I failed in my hope, the 
more so because I deemed the man had some knowledge; but reflecting again on the 
space of time during which I would have to linger over those branches of 
learning, I was not able to endure longer procrastination. In my helpless 
condition it occurred to me to have a meeting with the Platonists, for their 
fame was great. I thereupon spent as much of my time as possible with one who 
had lately settled in our city,--a sagacious man, holding a high position among 
the Platonists,--and I progressed, and made the greatest improvements daily. And 
the perception of immaterial things quite overpowered me, and the contemplation 
of ideas furnished my mind with wings, so that in a little while I supposed that 
I had become wise; and such was my stupidity, I expected forthwith to look upon 
God, for this is the end of Plato's philosophy. 
CHAPTER III -- JUSTIN NARRATES THE MANNER OF HIS CONVERSION. 
"And while I was thus disposed, when I wished at one period to be filled with 
great quietness, and to shun the path of men, I used to go into a certain field 
not far from the sea. And when I was near that spot one day, which having 
reached I purposed to be by myself, a certain old man, by no means contemptible 
in appearance, exhibiting meek and venerable manners, followed me at a little 
distance. And when I turned round to him, having halted, I fixed my eyes rather 
keenly on him. 
"And he said, 'Do you know me?' 
I replied in the negative. 
"'Why, then,' said he to me, 'do you so look at me? 
"'I am astonished,' I said, 'because you have chanced to be in my company in 
the same place; for I had not expected to see any man here.' 
"And he says to me, 'I am concerned about some of my household. These are 
gone away from me; and therefore have I come to make personal search for them, 
if, perhaps, they shall make their appearance somewhere. But why are you here?' 
said he to me. 
"'I delight,' said I, 'in such walks, where my attention is not distracted, 
for converse with myself is uninterrupted; and such places are most fit for 
philology.' 
"'Are you, then, a philologian,' said he, but no lover of deeds or of truth? 
and do you not aim at being a practical man so much as being a sophist?' 
"'What greater work,' said I, 'could one accomplish than this, to show the 
reason which governs all, and having laid hold of it, and being mounted upon it, 
to look down on the errors of others, and their pursuits? But without philosophy 
and right reason, prudence would not be present to any man. Wherefore it is 
necessary for every man to philosophize, and to esteem this the greatest and 
most honourable work; but other things only of second-rate or third-rate 
importance, though, indeed, if they be made to depend on philosophy, they are of 
moderate value, and worthy of acceptance; but deprived of it, and not 
accompanying it, they are vulgar and coarse to those who pursue them.' 
"'Does philosophy, then, make happiness?' said he, interrupting. 
"'Assuredly,' I said, 'and it alone.' 
"'What, then, is philosophy?' he says; 'and what is happiness? Pray tell me, 
unless something hinders you from saying.' 
"'Philosophy, then,' said I, 'is the knowledge of that which really exists, 
and a clear perception of the truth; and happiness is the reward of such 
knowledge and wisdom.' 
"'But what do you call God?' said he. 
"'That which always maintains the same nature, and in the same manner, and is 
the cause of all other things--that, indeed, is God.' So I answered him; and he 
listened to me with pleasure, and thus again interrogated me:-- 
"'Is not knowledge a term common to different matters? For in arts of all 
kinds, he who knows any one of them is called a skilful man in the art of 
generalship, or of ruling, or of healing equally. But in divine and human 
affairs it is not so. Is there a knowledge which affords understanding of human 
and divine things, and then a thorough acquaintance with the divinity and the 
righteousness of them?' 
"'Assuredly,' I replied. 
"'What, then? Is it in the same way we know man and' God, as we know music, 
and arithmetic, and astronomy, or any other similar branch?' 
"'By no means,' I replied. 
"'You have not answered me correctly, then,' he said; 'for some [branches of 
knowledge] come to us by learning, or by some employment, while of others we 
have knowledge by sight. Now, if one were to tell you that there exists in India 
an animal with a nature unlike all others, but of such and such a kind, 
multiform and various, you would not know it before you saw it; but neither 
would you be competent to give any account of it, unless you should hear from 
one who had seen it.' 
"'Certainly not,' I said. 
"'How then,' he said, 'should the philosophers judge correctly about God, or 
speak any truth, when they have no knowledge of Him, having neither seen Him at 
any time, nor heard Him?' 
"'But, father,' said I, 'the Deity cannot be seen merely by the eyes, as 
other living beings can, but is discernible to the mind alone, as Plato says; 
and I believe him.' 
CHAPTER IV -- THE SOUL OF ITSELF CANNOT SEE GOD. 
"'Is there then,' says he, 'such and so great power in our mind? Or can a man 
not perceive by sense sooner? Will the mind of man see God at any time, if it is 
uninstructed by the Holy Spirit?' 
"'Plato indeed says,' replied I, 'that the mind's eye is of such a nature, 
and has been given for this end, that we may see that very Being when the mind 
is pure itself, who is the cause of all discerned by the mind, having no colour, 
no form, no greatness--nothing, indeed, which the bodily eye looks upon; but It 
is something of this sort, he goes on to say, that is beyond all essence, 
unutterable and inexplicable, but alone honourable and good, coming suddenly 
into souls well-dispositioned, on account of their affinity to and desire of 
seeing Him.' 
"'What affinity, then,' replied he, 'is there between us and God? Is the soul 
also divine and immortal, and a part of that very regal mind? And even as that 
sees God, so also is it attainable by us to conceive of the Deity in our mind, 
and thence to become happy?' 
"'Assuredly,' I said. 
"'And do all the souls of all living beings comprehend Him?' he asked; 'or 
are the souls of men of one kind and the souls of horses and of asses of another 
kind?' 
"'No; but the souls which are in all are similar,' I answered. 
"'Then,' says he, 'shall both horses and asses see, or have they seen at some 
time or other, God?' 
"'No,' I said; 'for the majority of men will not, saving such as shall live 
justly, purified by righteousness, and by every other virtue.' 
"'It is not, therefore,' said he, 'on account of his affinity, that a man 
sees God, nor because he has a mind, but because he is temperate and righteous?' 

"'Yes,' said I; 'and because he has that whereby he perceives God.' 
"'What then? Do goats or sheep injure anyone?' 
"'No one in any respect,' I said. 
"'Therefore these animals will see [God] according to your account,' says he. 

"'No; for their body being of such a nature, is an obstacle to them.' 
"He rejoined,' If these animals could assume speech, be well assured that 
they would with greater reason ridicule our body; but let us now dismiss this 
subject, and let it be conceded to you as you say. Tell me, however, this: Does 
the soul see [God] so long as it is in the body, or after it has been removed 
from it?' 
"'So long as it is in the form of a man, it is possible for it,' I continue, 
'to attain to this by means of the mind; but especially when it has been set 
free from the body, and being apart by itself, it gets possession of that which 
it was wont continually and wholly to love.' 
"'Does it remember this, then [the sight of God], when it is again in the 
man?' 
"'It does not appear to me so,' I said. 
"'What, then, is the advantage to those who have seen [God]? or what has he 
who has seen more than he who has not seen, unless he remember this fact, that 
he has seen?' 
"'I cannot tell,' I answered. 
"'And what do those suffer who are judged to be unworthy of this spectacle?' 
said he. 
"'They are imprisoned in the bodies of certain wild beasts, and this is their 
punishment.' 
"'Do they know, then, that it is for this reason they are in such forms, and 
that they have committed some sin?' 
"'I do not think so.' 
"'Then these reap no advantage from their punishment, as it seems: moreover, 
I would say that they are not punished unless they are conscious of the 
punishment.' 
"'No indeed.' 
"'Therefore souls neither see God nor trans-migrate into other bodies; for 
they would know that so they are punished, and they would be afraid to commit 
even the most trivial sin afterwards. But that they can perceive that God 
exists, and that righteousness and piety are honourable, I also quite agree with 
you,' said he. 
"'You are right,' I replied. 
CHAPTER V -- THE SOUL IS NOT IN ITS OWN NATURE IMMORTAL. 
"'These philosophers know nothing, then, about these things; for they cannot 
tell what a soul is.' 
"'It does not appear so.' 
"'Nor ought it to be called immortal; for if it is immortal, it is plainly 
unbegotten.' 
"'It is both unbegotten and immortal, according to some who are styled 
Platonists.' 
"'Do you say that the world is also unbegotten?' 
"'Some say so. I do not, however, agree with them.' 
"'You are right; for what reason has one for supposing that a body so solid, 
possessing resistance, composite, changeable, decaying, and renewed every day, 
has not arisen from some cause? But if the world is begotten, souls also are 
necessarily begotten; and perhaps at one time they were not in existence, for 
they were made on account of men and other living creatures, if you will say 
that they have been begotten wholly apart, and not along with their respective 
bodies.' "'This seems to be correct.' 
"'They are not, then, immortal?' 
"'No; since the world has appeared to us to be begotten.' 
"'But I do not say, indeed, that all souls die; for that were truly a piece 
of good fortune to the evil. What then? The souls of the pious remain in a 
better place, while those of the unjust and wicked are in a worse, waiting for 
the time of judgment. Thus some which have appeared worthy of God never die; but 
others are punished so long as God wills them to exist and to be punished.' 
"'Is what you say, then, of a like nature with that which Plato in Timoeus 
hints about the world, when he says that it is indeed subject to decay, inasmuch 
as it has been created, but that it will neither be dissolved nor meet with the 
fate of death on account of the will of God? Does it seem to you the very same 
can be said of the soul, and generally of all things? For those things which 
exist after God, or shall at any time exist, these have the nature of decay, and 
are such as may be blotted out and cease to exist; for God alone is unbegotten 
and incorruptible, and therefore He is God, but all other things after Him are 
created and corruptible. For this reason souls both die and are punished: since, 
if they were unbegotten, they would neither sin, nor be filled with folly, nor 
be cowardly, and again ferocious; nor would they willingly transform into swine, 
and serpents, and dogs and it would not indeed be just to compel them, if they 
be unbegotten. For that which is unbegotten is similar to, equal to, and the 
same with that which is unbegotten; and neither in power nor in honour should 
the one be preferred to the other, and hence there are not many things which are 
unbegotten: for if there were some difference between them, you would not 
discover the cause of the difference, though you searched for it; but after 
letting the mind ever wander to infinity, you would at length, wearied out, take 
your stand on one Unbegotten, and say that this is the Cause of all. Did such 
escape the observation of Plato and Pythagoras, those wise men,' I said, 'who 
have been as a wall and fortress of philosophy to us?' 
CHAPTER VI -- THESE THINGS WERE UNKNOWN TO PLATO AND OTHER PHILOSOPHERS. 
"'It makes no matter to me,' said he, 'whether Plato or Pythagoras, or, in 
short, any other man held such opinions. For the truth is so; and you would 
perceive it from this. The soul assuredly is or has life. If, then, it is life, 
it would cause something else, and not itself, to live, even as motion would 
move something else than itself. Now, that the soul lives, no one would deny. 
But if it lives, it lives not as being life, but as the partaker of life; but 
that which partakes of anything, is different from that of which it does 
partake. Now the soul partakes of life, since God wills it to live. Thus, then, 
it will not even partake [of life] when God does not will it to live. For to 
live is not its attribute, as it is God's; but as a man does not live always, 
and the soul is not for ever conjoined with the body, since, whenever this 
harmony must be broken up, the soul leaves the body, and the man exists no 
longer; even so, whenever the soul must cease to exist, the spirit of life is 
removed from it, and there is no more soul, but it goes back to the place from 
whence it was taken.' 
CHAPTER VII -- THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH TO BE SOUGHT FROM THE PROPHETS ALONE. 
"'Should any one, then, employ a teacher?' I say, 'or whence may any one be 
helped, if not even in them there is truth?' 
"'There existed, long before this time, certain men more ancient than all 
those who are esteemed philosophers, both righteous and beloved by God, who 
spoke by the Divine Spirit, and foretold events which would take place, and 
which are now taking place. They are called prophets. These alone both saw and 
announced the truth to men, neither reverencing nor fearing any man, not 
influenced by a desire for glory, but speaking those things alone which they saw 
and which they heard, being filled with the Holy Spirit. Their writings are 
still extant, and he who has read them is very much helped in his knowledge of 
the beginning and end of things, and of those matters which the philosopher 
ought to know, provided he has believed them. For they did not use demonstration 
in their treatises, seeing that they were witnesses to the truth above all 
demonstration, and worthy of belief; and those events which have happened, and 
those which are happening, compel you to assent to the utterances made by them, 
although, indeed, they were entitled to credit on account of the miracles which 
they performed, since they both glorified the Creator, the God and Father of all 
things, and proclaimed His Son, the Christ [sent] by Him: which, indeed, the 
false prophets, who are filled with the lying unclean spirit, neither have done 
nor do, but venture to work certain wonderful deeds for the purpose of 
astonishing men, and glorify the spirits and demons of error. But pray that, 
above all things, the gates of light may be opened to you; for these things 
cannot be perceived or understood by all, but only by the man to whom God and 
His Christ have imparted wisdom.' 
CHAPTER VIII -- JUSTIN BY HIS COLLOQUY IS KINDLED WITH LOVE TO CHRIST. 
"When he had spoken these and many other things, which there is no time for 
mentioning at present, he went away, bidding me attend to them; and I have not 
seen him since. But straightway a flame was kindled in my soul; and a love of 
the prophets, and of those men who are friends of Christ, possessed me; and 
whilst revolving his words in my mind, I found this philosophy alone to be safe 
and profitable. Thus, and for this reason, I am a philosopher. Moreover, I would 
wish that all, making a resolution similar to my own, do not keep themselves 
away from the words of the Saviour. For they possess a terrible power in 
themselves, and are sufficient to inspire those who turn aside from the path of 
rectitude with awe; while the sweetest rest is afforded those who make a 
diligent practice of them. If, then, you have any concern for yourself, and if 
you are eagerly looking for salvation, and if you believe in God, you may--since 
you are not indifferent to the matter -- become acquainted with the Christ of 
God, and, after being initiated, live a happy life." 
When I had said this, my beloved friends those who were with Trypho laughed; 
but he, smiling, says, "I approve of your other remarks, and admire the 
eagerness with which you study divine things; but it were better for you still 
to abide in the philosophy of Plato, or of some other man, cultivating 
endurance, self-control, and moderation, rather than be deceived by false words, 
and follow the opinions of men of no reputation. For if you remain in that mode 
of philosophy, and live blamelessly, a hope of a better destiny were left to 
you; but when you have forsaken God, and reposed confidence in man, what safety 
still awaits you? If, then, you are willing to listen to me (for I have already 
considered you a friend), first be circumcised, then observe what ordinances 
have been enacted with respect to the Sabbath, and the feasts, and the new moons 
of God; and, in a word, do all things which have been written in the law: and 
then perhaps you shall obtain mercy from God. But Christ--if He has indeed been 
born, and exists anywhere--is unknown, and does not even know Himself, and has 
no power until Elias come to anoint Him, and make Him manifest to all. And you, 
having accepted a groundless report, invent a Christ for yourselves, and for his 
sake are inconsiderately perishing." 
CHAPTER IX -- THE CHRISTIANS HAVE NOT BELIEVED GROUNDLESS STORIES. 
"I excuse and forgive you, my friend," I said. "For you know not what you 
say, but have been persuaded by teachers who do not understand the Scriptures; 
and you speak, like a diviner whatever comes into your mind. But if you are 
willing to listen to an account of Him, how we have not been deceived, and shall 
not cease to confess Him,--although men's reproaches be heaped upon us, although 
the most terrible tyrant compel us to deny Him,--I shall prove to you as you 
stand here that we have not believed empty fables, or words without any 
foundation but words filled with the Spirit of God, and big with power, and 
flourishing with grace." 
Then again those who were in his company laughed, and shouted in an unseemly 
manner. Then I rose up and was about to leave; but he, taking hold of my 
garment, said I should not accomplish that until I had performed what I 
promised. "Let not, then, your companions be so tumultuous, or behave so 
disgracefully," I said. "But if they wish, let them listen in silence; or, if 
some better occupation prevent them, let them go away; while we, having retired 
to some spot, and resting there, may finish the discourse." It seemed good to 
Trypho that we should do so; and accordingly, having agreed upon it, we retired 
to the middle space of the Xystus. Two of his friends, when they had ridiculed 
and made game of our zeal, went off. And when we were come to that place, where 
there are stone seats on both sides, those with Trypho, having seated themselves 
on the one side, conversed with each other, some one of them having thrown in a 
remark about the war waged in Judaea. 
CHAPTER X -- TRYPHO BLAMES THE CHRISTIANS FOR THIS ALONE--THE NON-OBSERVANCE 
OF THE LAW. 
And when they ceased, I again addressed them thus:-- 
"Is there any other matter, my friends, in which we are blamed, than this, 
that we live not after the law, and are not circumcised in the flesh as your 
forefathers were, and do not observe sabbaths as you do? Are our lives and 
customs also slandered among you? And I ask this: have you also believed 
concerning us, that we eat men; and that after the feast, having extinguished 
the lights, we engage in promiscuous concubinage? Or do you condemn us in this 
alone, that we adhere to such tenets, and believe in an opinion, untrue, as you 
think?" 
"This is what we are amazed at," said Trypho, "but those things about which 
the multitude speak are not worthy of belief; for they are most repugnant to 
human nature. Moreover, I am aware that your precepts in the so-called Gospel 
are so wonderful and so great, that I suspect no one can keep them; for I have 
carefully read them. But this is what we are most at a loss about: that you, 
professing to be pious, and supposing yourselves better than others, are not in 
any particular separated from them, and do not alter your mode of living from 
the nations, in that you observe no festivals or sabbaths, and do not have the 
rite of circumcision; and further, resting your hopes on a man that was 
crucified, you yet expect to obtain some good thing from God, while you do not 
obey His commandments. Have you not read, that soul shall be cut off from his 
people who shall not have been circumcised on the eighth day? And this has been 
ordained for strangers and for slaves equally. But you, despising this covenant 
rashly, reject the consequent duties, and attempt to persuade yourselves that 
you know God, when, however, you perform none of those things which they do who 
fear God. If, therefore, you can defend yourself on these points, and make it 
manifest in what way you hope for anything whatsoever, even though you do not 
observe the law, this we would very gladly hear from you, and we shall make 
other similar investigations." 
CHAPTER XI -- THE LAW ABROGATED; THE NEW TESTAMENT PROMISED AND GIVEN BY GOD. 

"There will be no other God, O Trypho, nor was there from eternity any other 
existing" (I thus addressed him), "but He who made and disposed all this 
universe. Nor do we think that there is one God for us, another for you, but 
that He alone is God who led your fathers out from Egypt with a strong hand and 
a high arm. Nor have we trusted in any other (for there is no other), but in Him 
in whom you also have trusted, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. 
But we do not trust through Moses or through the law; for then we would do the 
same as yourselves. But now--(for I have read that there shall be a final law, 
and a covenant, the chiefest of all, which it is now incumbent on all men to 
observe, as many as are seeking after the inheritance of God. For the law 
promulgated on Horeb is now old, and belongs to yourselves alone; but 
this is for all universally. Now, law placed against law has abrogated 
that which is before it, and a covenant which comes after in like manner has put 
an end to the previous one; and an eternal and final law--namely, Christ--has 
been given to us, and the covenant is trustworthy, after which there shall be no 
law, no commandment, no ordinance. Have you not read this which Isaiah says: 
'Hearken unto Me, hearken unto Me, my people; and, ye kings, give ear unto Me: 
for a law shall go forth from Me, and My judgment shah be for a light to the 
nations. My righteousness approaches swiftly, and My salvation shall go forth, 
and nations shall trust in Mine arm?' And by Jeremiah, concerning this same new 
covenant, He thus speaks: 'Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will 
make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; not 
according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I 
took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt'). If, therefore, 
God proclaimed a new covenant which was to be instituted, and this for a light 
of the nations, we see and are persuaded that men approach God, leaving their 
idols and other unrighteousness, through the name of Him who was crucified, 
Jesus Christ, and abide by their confession even unto death, and maintain piety. 
Moreover, by the works and by the attendant miracles, it is possible for all to 
understand that He is the new law, and the new covenant, and the expectation of 
those who out of every people wait for the good things of God. For the true 
spiritual Israel, and descendants of Judah, Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham (who in 
uncircumcision was approved of and blessed by God on account of his faith, and 
called the father of many nations), are we who have been led to God through this 
crucified Christ, as shall be demonstrated while we proceed. 
CHAPTER XII -- THE JEWS VIOLATE THE ETERNAL LAW, AND INTERPRET ILL THAT OF 
MOSES. 
I also adduced another passage in which Isaiah exclaims: "'Hear My words, and 
your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the 
sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the people: 
nations which know not Thee shall call on Thee; peoples who know not Thee shall 
escape to Thee, because of thy God, the Holy One of Israel; for He has glorified 
Thee.' This same law you have despised, and His new holy covenant you have 
slighted; and now you neither receive it, nor repent of your evil deeds. 'For 
your ears are closed, your eyes are blinded, and the heart is hardened,' 
Jeremiah has cried; yet not even then do you listen. The Lawgiver is present, 
yet you do not see Him; to the poor the Gospel is preached, the blind see, yet 
you do not understand. You have now need of a second circumcision, though you 
glory greatly in the flesh. The new law requires you to keep perpetual sabbath, 
and you, because you are idle for one day, suppose you are pious, not discerning 
why this has been commanded you: and if you eat unleavened bread, you say the 
will of God has been fulfilled. The Lord our God does not take pleasure in such 
observances: if there is any perjured person or a thief among you, let him cease 
to be so; if any adulterer, let him repent; then he has kept the sweet and true 
sabbaths of God. If any one has impure hands, let him wash and be pure. 
CHAPTER XIII -- ISAIAH TEACHES THAT SINS ARE FORGIVEN THROUGH CHRIST'S BLOOD. 

"For Isaiah did not send you to a bath, there to wash away murder and other 
sins, which not even all the water of the sea were sufficient to purge; but, as 
might have been expected, this was that saving bath of the olden time which 
followed s those who repented, and who no longer were purified by the blood of 
goats and of sheep, or by the ashes of an heifer, or by the offerings of fine 
flour, but by faith through the blood of Christ, and through His death, who died 
for this very reason, as Isaiah himself said, when he spake thus: 'The Lord 
shall make bare His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations, and all the nations 
and the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of God. Depart ye, depart ye, 
depart ye, go ye out from thence, and touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the 
midst of her, be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord, for ye go not with 
haste. For the Lord shall go before you; and the Lord, the God of Israel, shall 
gather you together. Behold, my servant shall deal prudently; and He shall be 
exalted, and be greatly glorified. As many were astonished at Thee, so Thy form 
and Thy glory shall be marred more than men. So shall many nations be astonished 
at Him, and the kings shall shut their mouths; for that which had not been told 
them concerning Him shall they see, and that which they had not heard shall they 
consider. Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord 
revealed? We have announced Him as a child before Him, as a root in a dry 
ground. He hath no form or comeliness, and when we saw Him He had no form or 
beauty; but His form is dishonoured, and fails more than the sons of men. He is 
a man in affliction, and acquainted with bearing sickness, because His face has 
been turned away; He was despised, and we esteemed Him not. He bears our sins, 
and is distressed for us; and we esteemed Him to be in toil and in affliction, 
and in evil treatment But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised 
for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him. With His stripes 
we are healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray. Every man has turned to his 
own way; and the Lord laid on Him our iniquities, and by reason of His 
oppression He opens not His mouth. He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter; 
and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth. In His 
humiliation His judgment was taken away. And who shall declare His generation? 
For His life is taken from the earth. Because of the transgressions of my people 
He came unto death. And I will give the wicked for His grave, and the rich for 
His death, because He committed no iniquity, and deceit was not found in His 
mouth. And the Lord wills to purify Him from affliction. If he has been given 
for sin, your soul shall see a long-lived seed. And the Lord wills to take His 
soul away from trouble, to show Him light, and to form Him in understanding, to 
justify the righteous One who serves many well. And He shall bear our sins; 
therefore He shall inherit many, and shall divide the spoil of the strong, 
because His soul was delivered to death; and He was numbered with the 
transgressors, and He bare the sins of many, and was delivered for their 
transgression. Sing, O barren, who bearest not; break forth and cry aloud, thou 
who dost not travail in pain: for more are the children of the desolate than the 
children of the married wife. For the Lord said, Enlarge the place of thy tent 
and of thy curtains; fix them, spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy 
stakes; stretch forth to thy right and thy left; and thy seed shall inherit the 
Gentiles, and thou shalt make the desolate cities to be inherited. Fear not 
because thou art ashamed, neither be thou confounded because thou hast been 
reproached; for thou shalt forget everlasting shame, and shalt not remember the 
reproach of thy widowhood, because the Lord has made a name for Himself, and He 
who has redeemed thee shall be called through the whole earth the God of Israel. 
The Lord has called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, as a woman 
hated from her youth.' 
CHAPTER XIV -- RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NOT PLACED IN JEWISH RITES, BUT IN THE 
CONVERSION OF THE HEART GIVEN IN BAPTISM BY CHRIST. 
"By reason, therefore, of this laver of repentance and knowledge of God, 
which has been ordained on account of the transgression of God's people, as 
Isaiah cries, we have believed, and testify that that very baptism which he 
announced is alone able to purify those who have repented; and this is the water 
of life. But the cisterns which you have dug for yourselves are broken and 
profitless to you. For what is the use of that baptism which cleanses the flesh 
and body alone? Baptize the soul from wrath and from covetousness, from envy, 
and from hatred; and, lo! the body is pure. For this is the symbolic 
significance of unleavened bread, that you do not commit the old deeds of wicked 
leaven. But you have understood all things in a carnal sense, and you suppose it 
to be piety if you do such things, while your souls are filled with deceit, and, 
in short, with every wickedness. Accordingly, also, after the seven days of 
eating unleavened bread, God commanded them to mingle new leaven, that is, the 
performance of other works, and not the imitation of the old and evil works. And 
because this is what this new Lawgiver demands of you, I shall again refer to 
the words which have been quoted by me, and to others also which have been 
passed over. They are related by Isaiah to the following effect: 'Hearken to me, 
and your soul shall live; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, even 
the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the people, 
a leader and commander to the nations. Nations which know not Thee shall call on 
Thee; and peoples who know not Thee shall escape unto Thee, because of Thy God, 
the Holy One of Israel, for He has glorified Thee. Seek ye God; and when you 
find Him, call on Him, so long as He may be nigh you. Let the wicked forsake his 
ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, 
and he will obtain mercy, because He will abundantly pardon your sins. For my 
thoughts are not as your thoughts, neither are my ways as your ways; but as far 
removed as the heavens are from the earth, so far is my way removed from your 
way, and your thoughts from my thoughts. For as the snow or the rain descends 
from heaven, and shall not return till it waters the earth, and makes it bring 
forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread for food, so shall My word 
be that goeth forth out of My mouth: it shall not return until it shall have 
accomplished all that I desired, and I shall make My commandments prosperous. 
For ye shall go out with joy, and be taught with gladness. For the mountains and 
the hills shall leap while they expect you, and all the trees of the fields 
shall applaud with their branches: and instead of the thorn shall come up the 
cypress, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle. And the Lord shall 
be for a name, and for an everlasting sign, and He shall not fail!' Of these and 
such like words written by the prophets, O Trypho," said I, "some have reference 
to the first advent of Christ, in which He is preached as inglorious, obscure, 
and of mortal appearance: but others had reference to His second advent, when He 
shall appear in glory and above the clouds; and your nation shall see and know 
Him whom they have pierced, as Hosea, one of the twelve prophets, and Daniel, 
foretold. 
CHAPTER XV -- IN WHAT THE TRUE FASTING CONSISTS. 
"Learn, therefore, to keep the true fast of God, as Isaiah says, that you may 
please God. Isaiah has cried thus: 'Shout vehemently, and do not spare: lift up 
thy voice as with a trumpet, and show My people their transgressions, and the 
house of Jacob their sins. They seek Me from day to day, and desire to know My 
ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the judgment of God. 
They ask of Me now righteous judgment, and desire to draw near to God, saying, 
Wherefore have we fasted, and Thou seest not? and afflicted our souls, and Thou 
hast not known? Because in the days of your fasting you find your own pleasure, 
and oppress all those who are subject to you. Behold, ye fast for strifes and 
debates, and smite the humble with your fists. Why do ye fast for Me, as to-day, 
so that your voice is heard aloud? This is not the fast which I have chosen, the 
day in which a man shall afflict his soul. And not even if you bend your neck 
like a ring, or clothe yourself in sackcloth and ashes, shall you call this a 
fast, and a day acceptable to the Lord. This is not the fast which I have 
chosen, saith the Lord; but loose every unrighteous bond, dissolve the terms of 
wrongous covenants, let the oppressed go free, and avoid every iniquitous 
contract. Deal thy bread to the hungry, and lead the homeless poor under thy 
dwelling; if thou seest the naked, clothe him; and do not hide thyself from 
thine own flesh. Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy 
garments shall rise up quickly: and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and 
the glory of God shall envelope thee. Then shalt thou cry, and the Lord shall 
hear thee: while thou art speaking, He will say, Behold, I am here. And if thou 
take away from thee the yoke, and the stretching out of the hand, and the word 
of murmuring; and shalt give heartily thy bread to the hungry, and shalt satisfy 
the afflicted soul; then shall thy light arise in the darkness, and thy darkness 
shall be as the noon-day: and thy God shall be with thee continually, and thou 
shalt be satisfied according as thy soul desireth, and thy bones shall become 
fat, and shall be as a watered garden, and as a fountain of water, or as a land 
where water fails not.' 'Circumcise, therefore, the foreskin of your heart,' as 
the words of God in all these passages demand." 
CHAPTER XVI -- CIRCUMCISION GIVEN AS A SIGN, THAT THE JEWS MIGHT BE DRIVEN 
AWAY FOR THEIR EVIL DEEDS DONE TO CHRIST AND THE CHRISTIANS. 
"And God himself proclaimed by Moses, speaking thus: 'And circumcise the 
hardness of your hearts, and no longer stiffen the neck. For the Lord your God 
is both Lord of lords, and a great, mighty, and terrible God, who regardeth not 
persons, and taketh not rewards.' And in Leviticus: 'Because they have 
transgressed against Me, and despised Me, and because they have walked contrary 
to Me, I also walked contrary to them, and I shall cut them off in the land of 
their enemies. Then shall their uncircumcised heart be turned.' For the 
circumcision according to the flesh, which is from Abraham, was given for a 
sign; that you may be separated from other nations, and from us; and that you 
alone may suffer that which you now justly suffer; and that your land may be 
desolate, and your cities burned with fire; and that strangers may eat your 
fruit in your presence, and not one of you may go up to Jerusalem.' For you are 
not recognised among the rest of men by any other mark than your fleshly 
circumcision. For none of you, I suppose, will venture to say that God neither 
did nor does foresee the events, which are future, nor fore-ordained his deserts 
for each one. Accordingly, these things have happened to you in fairness and 
justice, for you have slain the Just One, and His prophets before Him; and now 
you reject those who hope in Him, and in Him who sent Him--God the Almighty and 
Maker of all things--cursing in your synagogues those that believe on Christ. 
For you have not the power to lay hands upon us, on account of those who now 
have the mastery. But as often as you could, you did so. Wherefore God, by 
Isaiah, calls to you, saying, 'Behold how the righteous man perished, and no one 
regards it. For the righteous man is taken away from before iniquity. His grave 
shall be in peace, he is taken away from the midst. Draw near hither, ye lawless 
children, seed of the adulterers, and children of the whore. Against whom have 
you sported yourselves, and against whom have you opened the mouth, and against 
whom have you loosened the tongue?' 
CHAPTER XVII -- THE JEWS SENT PERSONS THROUGH THE WHOLE EARTH TO SPREAD 
CALUMNIES ON CHRISTIANS. 
"For other nations have not inflicted on us and on Christ this wrong to such 
an extent as you have, who in very deed are the authors of the wicked prejudice 
against the Just One, and us who hold by Him. For after that you had crucified 
Him, the only blameless and righteous Man,-- through whose swipes those who 
approach the Father by Him are healed,--when you knew that He had risen from the 
dead and ascended to heaven, as the prophets foretold He would, you not only did 
not repent of the wickedness which you had committed, but at that time you 
selected and sent out from Jerusalem chosen men through all the land to tell 
that the godless heresy of the Christians had sprung up, and to publish those 
things which all they who knew us not speak against us. So that you are the 
cause not only of your own unrighteousness, but in fact of that of all other 
men. And Isaiah cries justly: 'By reason of you, My name is blasphemed among the 
Gentiles.' And: 'Woe unto their soul! because they have devised an evil device 
against themselves, saying, Let us bind the righteous, for he is distasteful to 
us. Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their doings. Woe unto the wicked evil 
shall be rendered to him according to the works of his hands.' And again, in 
other words: 'Woe unto them that draw their iniquity as with a long cord, and 
their transgressions as with the harness of a heifer's yoke: who say, Let his 
speed come near; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may 
know it. Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put light for 
darkness, and darkness for light; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for 
bitter!' Accordingly, you displayed great zeal in publishing throughout all the 
land bitter and dark and unjust things against the only blameless and righteous 
Light sent by God. 
For He appeared distasteful to you when He cried among you, 'It is written, 
My house is the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves!' He 
overthrew also the tables of the money-changers in the temple, and exclaimed, 
'Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye pay tithe of mint 
and rue, but do not observe the love of God and justice. Ye whited sepulchres! 
appearing beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones.' And to 
the Scribes, 'Woe unto you, Scribes! for ye have the keys, and ye do not enter 
in yourselves, and them that are entering in ye hinder; ye blind guides!' 
CHAPTER XVIII -- CHRISTIANS WOULD OBSERVE THE LAW, IF THEY DID NOT KNOW WHY 
IT WAS INSTITUTED. 
"For since you have read, O Trypho, as you yourself admitted, the doctrines 
taught by our Saviour, I do not think that I have done foolishly in adding some 
short utterances of His to the prophetic statements. Wash therefore, and be now 
clean, and put away iniquity from your souls, as God bids you be washed in this 
layer, and be circumcised with the true circumcision. For we too would observe 
the fleshly circumcision, and the Sabbaths, and in short all the feasts, if we 
did not know for what reason they were enjoined you,--namely, on account of your 
transgressions and the hardness of your hearts. For if we patiently endure all 
things contrived against us by wicked men and demons, so that even amid 
cruelties unutterable, death and torments, we pray for mercy to those who 
inflict such things upon us, and do not wish to give the least retort to any 
one, even as the new Lawgiver commanded us: how is it, Trypho, that we would not 
observe those rites which do not harm us,--I speak of fleshly circumcision, and 
Sabbaths, and feasts? 
CHAPTER XIX -- CIRCUMCISION UNKNOWN BEFORE ABRAHAM. THE LAW WAS GIVEN BY 
MOSES ON ACCOUNT OF THE HARDNESS OF THEIR HEARTS. 
"It is this about which we are at a loss, and with reason, because, while you 
endure such things, you do not observe all the other customs which we are now 
discussing." 
"This circumcision is not, however, necessary for all men, but for you alone, 
in order that, as I have already said, you may suffer these things which you now 
justly suffer. Nor do we receive that useless baptism of cisterns, for it has 
nothing to do with this baptism of life. Wherefore also God has announced that 
you have forsaken Him, the living fountain, and digged for your selves broken 
cisterns which can hold no water. Even you, who are the circumcised according to 
the flesh, have need of our circumcision; but we, having the latter, do not 
require the former. For if it were necessary, as you suppose, God would not have 
made Adam uncircumcised would not have had respect to the gifts of Abel when, 
being uncircumcised, he offered sacrifice and would not have been pleased with 
the uncircumcision of Enoch, who was not found, because God had translated him. 
Lot, being uncircumcised, was saved from Sodom, the angels themselves and the 
Lord sending him out. Noah was the beginning of our race; yet, uncircumcised, 
along with his children he went into the ark. Melchizedek, the priest of the 
Most High, was uncircumcised; to whom also Abraham the first who received 
circumcision after the flesh, gave tithes, and he blessed him: after whose order 
God declared, by the mouth of David, that He would establish the everlasting 
priest. Therefore to you alone this circumcision was necessary, in order that 
the people may be no people, and the nation no nation; as also Hosea, one of the 
twelve prophets, declares. Moreover, all those righteous men already mentioned, 
though they kept no Sabbaths, were pleasing to God; and after them Abraham with 
all his descendants until Moses, under whom your nation appeared unrighteous and 
ungrateful to God, making a calf in the wilderness: wherefore God, accommodating 
Himself to that nation, enjoined them also to offer sacrifices, as if to His 
name, in order that you might not serve idols. Which precept, however, you have 
not observed; nay, you sacrificed your children to demons. And you were 
commanded to keep Sabbaths, that you might retain the memorial of God. For His 
word makes this announcement, saying, 'That ye may know that I am God who 
redeemed you.' 
CHAPTER XX -- WHY CHOICE OF MEATS WAS PRESCRIBED. 
"Moreover, you were commanded to abstain from certain kinds of food, in order 
that you might keep God before your eyes while you ate and drank, seeing that 
you were prone and very ready to depart from His knowledge, as Moses also 
affirms: 'The people ate and drank, and rose up to play.' And again: 'Jacob ate, 
and was satisfied, and waxed fat; and he who was beloved kicked: he waxed fat, 
he grew thick, he was enlarged, and he forsook God who had made him.' For it was 
told you by Moses in the book of Genesis, that God granted to Noah, being a just 
man, to eat of every animal, but not of flesh with the blood, which is dead." 
And as he was ready to say, "as the green herbs," I anticipated him: "Why do you 
not receive this statement, 'as the green herbs,' in the sense in which it was 
given by God, to wit, that just as God has granted the herbs for sustenance to 
man, even so has He given the animals for the diet of flesh? But, you say, a 
distinction was laid down thereafter to Noah, because we do not eat certain 
herbs. As you interpret it, the thing is incredible. And first I shall not 
occupy myself with this, though able to say and to hold that every vegetable is 
food, and fit to be eaten. But although we discriminate between green herbs, not 
eating all, we refrain from eating some, not because they are common or unclean, 
but because they are bitter, or deadly, or thorny. But we lay hands on and take 
of all herbs which are sweet, very nourishing and good, whether they are marine 
or land plants. Thus also God by the mouth of Moses commanded you to abstain 
from unclean and improper and violent animals: when, moreover, though you were 
eating manna in the desert, and were seeing all those wondrous acts wrought for 
you by God, you made and worshipped the golden calf. Hence he cries continually, 
and justly, 'They are foolish children, in whom is no faith.' 
CHAPTER XXI -- SABBATHS WERE INSTITUTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE PEOPLE'S SINS, AND 
NOT FOR A WORK OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. 
"Moreover, that God enjoined you to keep the Sabbath, and impose on you other 
precepts for a sign, as I have already said, on account of your unrighteousness, 
and that of your fathers,--as He declares that for the sake of the nations, lest 
His name be profaned among them, therefore He permitted some of you to remain 
alive,--these words of His can prove to you: they are narrated by Ezekiel thus: 
I am the Lord your God; walk in My statutes, and keep My judgments, and take no 
part in the customs of Egypt; and hallow My Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign 
between Me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God. 
Notwithstanding ye rebelled against Me, and your children walked not in My 
statutes, neither kept My judgments to do them: which if a man do, he shall live 
in them. But they polluted My Sabbaths. And I said that I would pour out My fury 
upon them in the wilderness, to accomplish My anger upon them; yet I did it not; 
that My name might not be altogether profaned in the sight of the heathen. I led 
them out before their eyes, and I lifted up Mine hand unto them in the 
wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them 
through the countries; because they had not executed My judgments, but had 
despised My statutes, and polluted My Sabbaths, and their eyes were after the 
devices of their fathers. Wherefore I gave them also statutes which were not 
good, and judgments whereby they shall not live. And I shall pollute them in 
their own gifts, that I may destroy all that openeth the womb, when I pass 
through them.' 
CHAPTER XXII -- SO ALSO WERE SACRIFICES AND OBLATIONS. 
"And that you may learn that it was for the sins of your own nation, and for 
their idolatries and not because there was any necessity for such sacrifices, 
that they were likewise enjoined, listen to the manner in which He speaks of 
these by Amos, one of the twelve, saying: 'Woe unto you that desire the day of 
the Lord! to what end is this day of the Lord for you? It is darkness and not 
light, as when a man flees from the face of a lion, and a bear meets him; and he 
goes into his house, and leans his hands against the wall, and the serpent bites 
him. Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness and not light, even very dark, 
and no brightness in it? I have hated, I have despised your feast-days, and I 
will not smell in your solemn assemblies: wherefore, though ye offer Me your 
burnt-offerings and sacrifices, I will not accept them; neither will I regard 
the peace-offerings of your presence. Take thou away from Me the multitude of 
thy songs and psalms; I will not hear thine instruments. But let judgment be 
rolled down as water, and righteousness as an impassable torrent. Have ye 
offered unto Me victims and sacrifices in the wilderness, O house of Israel? 
saith the Lord. And have ye taken up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of 
your god Raphan, the figures which ye made for yourselves? And I will carry you 
away beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, whose name is the Almighty God. Woe to 
them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria: those who 
are named among the chiefs have plucked away the first-fruits of the nations: 
the house of Israel have entered for themselves. Pass all of you unto Calneh, 
and see; and from thence go ye unto Hamath the great, and go down thence to Gath 
of the strangers, the noblest of all these kingdoms, if their boundaries are 
greater than your boundaries. Ye who come to the evil day, who are approaching, 
and who hold to false Sabbaths; who lie on beds of ivory, and are at ease upon 
their couches; who eat the lambs out of the flock, and the sucking calves out of 
the midst of the herd; who applaud at the sound of the musical instruments; they 
reckon them as stable, and not as fleeting, who drink wine in bowls, and anoint 
themselves with the chief ointments, but they are not grieved for the affliction 
of Joseph. Wherefore now they shall be captives, among the first of the nobles 
who are carried away; and the house of evil-doers shall be removed, and the 
neighing of horses shall be taken away from Ephraim. And again by Jeremiah: 
'Collect your flesh, and sacrifices, and eat: for concerning neither sacrifices 
nor libations did I command your fathers in the day in which I took them by the 
hand to lead them out of Egypt. And again by David, in the forty-ninth Psalm, He 
thus said: 'The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken, and called the earth, from 
the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. Out of Zion is the perfection 
of His beauty. God, even our God, shall come openly, and shall not keep silence. 
Fire shall burn before Him, and it shall be very temptestuous round about Him. 
He shall call to the heavens above, and to the earth, that He may judge His 
people. Assemble to Him His saints; those that have made a covenant with Him by 
sacrifices. And the heavens shall declare His righteousness, for God is judge. 
Hear, O My people, and I will speak to thee; O Israel, and I will testify to 
thee, I am God, even thy God. I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; thy 
burnt-offerings are continually before me. I will take no bullocks out of thy 
house, nor he-goats out of thy folds: for all the beasts of the field are Mine, 
the herds and the oxen on the mountains. I know all the fowls of the heavens, 
and the beauty of the field is Mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; 
for the world is Mine, and the fulness thereof. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, 
or drink the blood of goats? Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy 
vows unto the Most High, and call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will 
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me. But unto the wicked God saith, What 
hast thou to do to declare My statutes, and to take My covenant into thy mouth? 
But thou hast hated instruction, and cast My words behind thee. When thou sawest 
a thief, thou consentedst with him; and hast been partaker with the adulterer. 
Thy mouth has framed evil, and thy tongue has enfolded deceit. Thou sittest and 
speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son. These 
things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I would be like 
thyself in wickedness. I will reprove thee, and set thy sins in order before 
thine eyes. Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest He tear you in pieces, 
and there be none to deliver. The sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me; and 
there is the way in which I shall show him My salvation. Accordingly He neither 
takes sacrifices from you nor commanded them at first to be offered because they 
are needful to Him, but because of your sins. For indeed the temple, which is 
called the temple in Jerusalem, He admitted to be His house or court, not as 
though He needed it, but in order that you, in this view of it, giving 
yourselves to Him, might not worship idols. And that this is so, Isaiah says: 
'What house have ye built Me? saith the Lord. Heaven is My throne, and earth is 
My footstool.' 
CHAPTER XXXIII -- THE OPINION OF THE JEWS REGARDING THE LAW DOES AN INJURY TO 
GOD. 
"But if we do not admit this, we shall be liable to fall into foolish 
opinions, as if it were not the same God who existed in the times of Enoch and 
all the rest, who neither were circumcised after the flesh, nor observed 
Sabbaths, nor any other rites, seeing that Moses enjoined such observances; or 
that God has not wished each race of mankind continually to perform the same 
righteous actions: to admit which, seems to be ridiculous and absurd. Therefore 
we must confess that He, who is ever the same, has commanded these and such like 
institutions on account of sinful men, and we must declare Him to be benevolent, 
foreknowing, needing nothing, righteous and good. But if this be not so, tell 
me, sir, what you think of those matters which we are investigating." And when 
no one responded: "Wherefore, Trypho, I will proclaim to you, and to those who 
wish to become proselytes, the divine message which I heard from that man. Do 
you see that the elements are not idle, and keep no Sabbaths? Remain as you were 
born. For if there was no need of circumcision before Abraham, or Of the 
observance of Sabbaths, of feasts and sacrifices, before Moses; no more need is 
there of them now, after that, according to the will of God, Jesus Christ the 
Son of God has been born without sin, of a virgin sprung from the stock of 
Abraham. For when Abraham himself was in un-circumcision, he was justified and 
blessed by reason of the faith which he reposed in God, as the Scripture tells. 
Moreover, the Scriptures and the facts themselves compel us to admit that He 
received circumcision for a sign, and not for righteousness. So that it was 
justly recorded concerning the people, that the soul which shall not be 
circumcised on the eighth day shall be cut off from his family. And, 
furthermore, the inability of the female sex to receive fleshly circumcision, 
proves that this circumcision has been given for a sign, and not for a work of 
righteousness. For God has given likewise to women the ability to observe all 
things which are righteous and virtuous; but we see that the bodily form of the 
male has been made different from the bodily form of the female; yet we know 
that neither of them is righteous or unrighteous merely for this cause, but [is 
considered righteous] by reason of piety and righteousness. 
CHAPTER XXIV -- THE CHRISTIANS' CIRCUMCISION FAR MORE EXCELLENT. 
"Now, sirs," I said, "it is possible for us to show how the eighth day 
possessed a certain mysterious import, which the seventh day did not possess, 
and which was promulgated by God through these rites. But lest I appear now to 
diverge to other subjects, understand what I say: the blood of that circumcision 
is obsolete, and we trust in the bloOd of salvation; there is now another 
covenant, and another law has gone forth from Zion. Jesus Christ circumcises all 
who will--as was declared above--with knives of stone; that they may be a 
righteous nation, a people keeping faith, holding to the truth, and maintaining 
peace. Come then with me, all who fear God, who wish to see the good of 
Jerusalem. Come, let us go to the light of the Lord; for He has liberated His 
people, the house of Jacob. Come, all nations; let us gather ourselves together 
at Jerusalem, no longer plagued by war for the sins of her people. 'For I was 
manifest to them that sought Me not; I was found of them that asked not for Me;' 
He exclaims by Isaiah: 'I said, Behold Me, unto nations which were not called by 
My name. I have spread out My hands all the day unto a disobedient and 
gainsaying people, which walked in a way that was not good, but after their own 
sins. It is a people that rovoketh Me to my face.' 
CHAPTER XXV -- THE JEWS BOAST IN VAIN THAT THEY ARE SONS OF ABRAHAM. 
"Those who justify themselves, and say they are sons of Abraham, shall be 
desirous even in a small degree to receive the inheritance along with you; as 
the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of Isaiah, cries, speaking thus while he 
personates them: 'Return from heaven, and behold from the habitation of Thy 
holiness and glory. Where is Thy zeal and strength? Where is the multitude of 
Thy mercy? for Thou hast sustained us, O Lord. For Thou art our Father, because 
Abraham is ignorant of us, and Israel has not recognised us. But Thou, O Lord, 
our Father, deliver us: from the beginning Thy name is upon us. O Lord, why hast 
Thou made us to err from Thy way? and hardened our hearts, so that we do not 
fear Thee? Return for Thy servants' sake, the tribes of Thine inheritance, that 
we may inherit for a little Thy holy mountain. We were as from the beginning, 
when Thou didst not bear rule over us, and when Thy name was not called upon us. 
If Thou wilt open the heavens, trembling shall seize the mountains before Thee: 
and they shall be melted, as wax melts before the fire; and fire shah consume 
the adversaries, and Thy name shall be manifest among the adversaries; the 
nations shall be put into disorder before Thy face. When Thou shall do glorious 
things, trembling shall seize the mountains before Thee. From the beginning we 
have not heard, nor have our eyes seen a God besides Thee: and Thy works, the 
mercy which Thou shall show to those who repent. He shall meet those who do 
righteousness, and they shall remember Thy ways. Behold, Thou art wroth, and we 
were sinning. Therefore we have erred and become all unclean, and all our 
righteousness is as the rags of a woman set apart: and we have faded away like 
leaves by reason of our iniquities; thus the wind will take us away. And there 
is none that calleth upon Thy name, or remembers to take hold of Thee; for Thou 
hast turned away Thy face from us, and hast given us up on account of our sins. 
And now return, O Lord, for we are all Thy people. The city of Thy holiness has 
become desolate. Zion has become as a wilderness, Jerusalem a curse; the house, 
our holiness, and the glory which our fathers blessed, has been burned with 
fire; and all the glorious nations have fallen along with it. And in addition to 
these [misfortunes], O Lord, Thou hast refrained Thyself, and art silent, and 
hast humbled us very much.'" 
And Trypho remarked, "What is this you say? that none of us shall inherit 
anything on the holy mountain of God?" 
CHAPTER XXVI -- NO SALVATION TO THE JEWS EXCEPT THROUGH CHRIST. 
And I replied, "I do not say so; but those who have persecuted and do 
persecute Christ, if they do not repent, shall not inherit anything on the holy 
mountain. But the Gentiles, who have believed on Him, and have repented of the 
sins which they have committed, they shall receive the inheritance along with 
the patriarchs and the prophets, and the just men who are descended from Jacob, 
even although they neither keep the Sabbath, nor are circumcised, nor observe 
the feasts. Assuredly they shall receive the holy inheritance of God. For God 
speaks by Isaiah thus: 'I, the Lord God, have called Thee in righteousness, and 
will hold Thine hand, and will strengthen Thee; and I have given Thee for a 
covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the 
blind, to bring out them that are bound from the chains, and those who sit in 
darkness from the prison-house.' And again: 'Lift up a standard s for the 
people; for, lo, the Lord has made it heard unto the end of the earth. Say ye to 
the daughters of Zion, Behold, thy Saviour has come; having His reward, and His 
work before His face: and He shall call it a holy nation, redeemed by the Lord. 
And thou shalt be called a city sought out, and not forsaken. Who is this that 
cometh from Edom? in red garments from Bosor? This that is beautiful in apparel, 
going up with great strength? I speak righteousness, and the judgment of 
salvation. Why are Thy garments red, and Thine apparel as from the trodden 
wine-press? Thou art full of the trodden grape. I have trodden the wine-press 
all alone, and of the people there is no man with Me; and I have trampled them 
in fury, and crushed them to the ground, and spilled their blood on the earth. 
For the day of retribution has come upon them, and the year of redemption is 
present. And I looked, and there was none to help; and I considered, and none 
assisted: and My arm delivered; and My fury came on them, and I trampled them in 
My fury, and spilled their blood on the earth.'" 
CHAPTER XXVII -- WHY GOD TAUGHT THE SAME THINGS BY THE PROPHETS AS BY MOSES. 
And Trypho said, "Why do you select and quote whatever you wish from the 
prophetic writings, but do not refer to those which expressly command the 
Sabbath to be observed? For Isaiah thus speaks: 'If thou shalt turn away thy 
foot from the Sabbaths, so as not to do thy pleasure on the holy day, and shalt 
call the Sabbaths the holy delights of thy God; if thou shalt not lift thy foot 
to work, and shalt not speak a word from thine own mouth; then thou shalt trust 
in the Lord, and He shall cause thee to go up to the good things of the land; 
and He shall feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy father: for the mouth 
of the Lord hath spoken it.'" 
And I replied, "I have passed them by, my friends, not because such 
prophecies were contrary to me, but because you have understood, and do 
understand, that although God commands you by all the prophets to do the same 
things which He also commanded by Moses, it was on account of the hardness of 
your hearts, and your ingratitude towards Him, that He continually proclaims 
them, in order that, even in this way, if you repented, you might please Him, 
and neither sacrifice your children to demons, nor be partakers with thieves, 
nor lovers of gifts, nor hunters after revenge, nor fail in doing judgment for 
orphans, nor be inattentive to the justice due to the widow nor have your hands 
full of blood. 'For the daughters of Zion have walked with a high neck, both 
sporting by winking with their eyes, and sweeping along their dresses. For they 
are all gone aside,' He exclaims, 'they are all become useless. There is none 
that understands, there is not so much as one. With their tongues they have 
practised deceit, their throat is an open sepulchre, the poison of asps is under 
their lips, destruction and misery are in their paths, and the way of peace they 
have not known.' So that, as in the beginning, these things were enjoined you 
because of your wickedness, in like manner because of your stedfastness in it, 
or rather your increased proneness to it, by means of the same precepts He calls 
you to a remembrance or knowledge of it. But you are a people hard-hearted and 
without understanding, both blind and lame, children in whom is no faith, as He 
Himself says, honouring Him only with your lips, far from Him in your hearts, 
teaching doctrines that are your own and not His. For, tell me, did God wish the 
priests to sin when they offer the sacrifices on the Sabbaths? or those to sin, 
who are circumcised and do circumcise on the Sabbaths; since He commands that on 
the eighth day--even though it happen to be a Sabbath--those who are born shall 
be always circumcised? or could not the infants be operated upon one day 
previous or one day subsequent to the Sabbath, if He knew that it is a sinful 
act upon the Sabbaths? Or why did He not teach those--who are called righteous 
and pleasing to Him, who lived before Moses and Abraham, who were not 
circumcised in their foreskin, and observed no Sabbaths--to keep these 
institutions?" 
CHAPTER XXVIII -- TRUE RIGHTEOUSNESS IS OBTAINED BY CHRIST. 
And Trypho replied, "We heard you adducing this consideration a little ago, 
and we have given it attention: for, to tell the truth, it is worthy of 
attention; and that answer which pleases most--namely, that so it seemed good to 
Him--does not satisfy me. For this is ever the shift to which those have 
recourse who are unable to answer the question." 
Then I said, "Since I bring from the Scriptures and the facts themselves both 
the proofs and the inculcation of them, do not delay or hesitate to put faith in 
me, although I am an uncircumcised man; so short a time is left you in which to 
become proselytes. If Christ's coming shall have anticipated you, in vain you 
will repent, in vain you will weep; for He will not hear yon. 'Break up your 
fallow ground,' Jeremiah has cried to the people, 'and sow not among thorns. 
Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and circumcise the foreskin of your heart.' 
Do not sow, therefore, among thorns, and in untilled ground, whence you can have 
no fruit. Know Christ; and behold the fallow ground, good, good and fat, is in 
your hearts. 'For, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will visit all 
them that are circumcised in their foreskins; Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and 
the sons of Moab. For all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of 
Israel are uncircumcised in their hearts.' Do you see how that God does not mean 
this circumcision which is given for a sign? For it is of no use to the 
Egyptians, or the sons of Moab, or the sons of Edom. But though a man be a 
Scythian or a Persian, if he has the knowledge of God and of His Christ, and 
keeps the everlasting righteous decrees, he is circumcised with the good and 
useful circumcision, and is a friend of God, and God rejoices in his gifts and 
offerings. But I will lay before you, my friends, the very words of God, when He 
said to the people by Malachi, one of the twelve prophets, 'I have no pleasure 
in you, saith the Lord; and I shall not accept your sacrifices at your hands: 
for from the rising of the sun unto its setting My name shall be glorified among 
the Gentiles; and in every place a sacrifice is offered unto My name, even a 
pure sacrifice: for My name is honoured among the Gentiles, saith the Lord; but 
ye profane it.' And by David He said, 'A people whom I have not known, served 
Me; at the hearing of the ear they obeyed Me.' 
CHAPTER XXIX -- CHRIST IS USELESS TO THOSE WHO OBSERVE THE LAW. 
"Let us glorify God, all nations gathered together; for He has also visited 
us. Let us glorify Him by the King of glory, by the Lord of hosts. For He has 
been gracious towards the Gentiles also; and our sacrifices He esteems more 
grateful than yours. What need, then, have I of circumcision, who have been 
witnessed to by God? What need have I of that other baptism, who have been 
baptized with the Holy Ghost? I think that while I mention this, I would 
persuade even those who are possessed of scanty intelligence. For these words 
have neither been prepared by me, nor embellished by the art of man; but David 
sung them, Isaiah preached them, Zechariah proclaimed them, and Moses wrote 
them. Are you acquainted with them, Trypho? They are contained in your 
Scriptures, or rather not yours, but ours. For we believe them; but you, though 
you read them, do not catch the spirit that is in them. Be not offended at, or 
reproach us with, the bodily uncircumcision with which God has created us; and 
think it not strange that we drink hot water on the Sabbaths, since God directs 
the government of the universe on this day equally as on all others; and the 
priests, as on other days, so on this, are ordered to offer sacrifices; and 
there are so many righteous men who have performed none of these legal 
ceremonies, and yet are witnessed to by God Himself. 
CHAPTER XXX -- CHRISTIANS POSSESS THE TRUE RIGHTEOUSNESS. 
"But impute it to your own wickedness, that God even can be accused by those 
who have no understanding, of not having always instructed all in the same 
righteous statutes. For such institutions seemed to be unreasonable and unworthy 
of God to many men, who had not received grace to know that your nation were 
called to conversion and repentance of spirit, while they were in a sinful 
condition and labouring under spiritual disease; and that the prophecy which was 
announced subsequent to the death of Moses is everlasting. And this is mentioned 
in the Psalm, my friends. And that we, who have been made wise by them, confess 
that the statutes of the Lord are sweeter than honey and the honey-comb, is 
manifest from the fact that, though threatened with death, we do not deny His 
name. Moreover, it is also manifest to all, that we who believe in Him pray to 
be kept by Him from strange, i.e., from wicked and deceitful, spirits; as the 
word of prophecy, personating one of those who believe in Him, figuratively 
declares. For we do continually beseech God by Jesus Christ to preserve us from 
the demons which are hostile to the worship of God, and whom we of old time 
served, in order that, after our conversion by Him to God, we may be blameless. 
For we call Him Helper and Redeemer, the power of whose name even the demons do 
fear; and at this day, when they are exorcised in the name of Jesus Christ, 
crucified under Pontius Pilate, governor of Judaea, they are overcome. And thus 
it is manifest to all, that His Father has given Him so great power, by virtue 
of which demons are subdued to His name, and to the dispensation of His 
suffering. 
CHAPTER XXXI -- IF CHRIST'S POWER BE NOW SO GREAT, HOW MUCH GREATER AT THE 
SECOND ADVENT! 
"But if so great a power is shown to have followed and to be still following 
the dispensation of His suffering, how great shall that be which shall follow 
His glorious advent! For He shall come on the clouds as the Son of man, so 
Daniel foretold, and His angels shall come with Him. These are the words: 'I 
beheld till the thrones were set; and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment 
was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool. His throne was 
like a fiery flame, His wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came 
forth from before Him. Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand 
times ten thousand stood before Him. The books were opened, and the judgment was 
set. I beheld then the voice of the great words which the horn speaks: and the 
beast was beat down, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. And 
the rest of the beasts were taken away from their dominion, and a period of life 
was given to the beasts until a season and time. I saw in the vision of the 
night, and, behold, one like the Son of man coming with the clouds of heaven; 
and He came to the Ancient of days, and stood before Him. And they who stood by 
brought Him near; and there were given Him power and kingly honour, and all 
nations of the earth by their families, and all glory, serve Him. And His 
dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not be taken away; and His 
kingdom shall not be destroyed. And my spirit was chilled within my frame, and 
the visions of my head troubled me. I came near unto one of them that stood by, 
and inquired the precise meaning of all these things. In answer he speaks to me, 
and showed me the judgment of the matters: These great beasts are four kingdoms, 
which shall perish from the earth, and shall not receive dominion for ever, even 
for ever and ever. Then I wished to know exactly about the fourth beast, which 
destroyed all [the others] and was very terrible, its teeth of iron, and its 
nails of brass; which devoured, made waste, and stamped the residue with its 
feet: also about the ten horns upon its head, and of the one which came up, by 
means of which three of the former fell. And that horn had eyes, and a mouth 
speaking great things; and its countenance excelled the rest. And I beheld that 
horn waging war against the saints, and prevailing against them, until the 
Ancient of days came; and He gave judgment for the saints of the Most High. And 
the time came, and the saints of the Most High possessed the kingdom. And it was 
told me concerning the fourth beast: There shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, 
which shall prevail over all these kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, 
and shall destroy and make it thoroughly waste. And the ten horns are ten kings 
that shall arise; and one shall arise after them; and he shall surpass the first 
in evil deeds, and he shall subdue three kings, and he shall speak words against 
the Most High, and shall overthrow the rest of the saints of the Most High, and 
shall expect to change the seasons and the times. And it shall be delivered into 
his hands for a time, and times, and half a time. And the judgment sat, and they 
shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. And the 
kingdom, and the power, and the great places of the kingdoms under the heavens, 
were given to the holy people of the Most High, to reign in an everlasting 
kingdom: and all powers shall be subject to Him, and shall obey Him. Hitherto is 
the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was possessed with a very great astonishment, 
and my speech was changed in me; yet I kept the matter in my heart.'" 
CHAPTER XXXII -- TRYPHO OBJECTING THAT CHRIST IS DESCRIBED AS GLORIOUS BY 
DANIEL, JUSTIN DISTINGUISHES TWO ADVENTS. 
And when I had ceased, Trypho said, "These and such like Scriptures, sir, 
compel us to wait for Him who, as Son of man, receives from the Ancient of days 
the everlasting kingdom. But this so-called Christ of yours was dishonourable 
and inglorious, so much so that the last curse contained in the law of God fell 
on him, for he was crucified." 
Then I replied to him, "If, sirs, it were not said by the Scriptures which I 
have already quoted, that His form was inglorious, and His generation not 
declared, and that for His death the rich would suffer death, and with His 
stripes we should be healed, and that He would be led away like a sheep; and if 
I had not explained that there would be two advents of His,--one in which He was 
pierced by you; a second, when you shall know Him whom you have pierced, and 
your tribes shall mourn, each tribe by itself, the women apart, and the men 
apart, --then I must have been speaking dubious and obscure things. But now, by 
means of the contents of those Scriptures esteemed holy and prophetic amongst 
you, I attempt to prove all [that I have adduced], in the hope that some one of 
you may be found to be of that remnant which has been left by the grace of the 
Lord of Sabaoth for the eternal salvation. In order, therefore, that the matter 
inquired into may be plainer to you, I will mention to you other words also 
spoken by the blessed David, from which you will perceive that the Lord is 
called the Christ by the Holy Spirit of prophecy; and that the Lord, the Father 
of all, has brought Him again from the earth, setting Him at His own right hand, 
until He makes His enemies His footstool; which indeed happens from the time 
that our Lord Jesus Christ ascended to heaven, after He rose again from the 
dead, the times now running on to their consummation; and he whom Daniel 
foretells would have dominion for a time, and times, and an half, is even 
already at the door, about to speak blasphemous and daring things against the 
Most High. But you, being ignorant of how long he will have dominion, hold 
another opinion. For you interpret the 'time' as being a hundred years. But if 
this is so, the man of sin must, at the shortest, reign three hundred and fifty 
years, in order that we may compute that which is said by the holy Daniel--'and 
times'--to be two times only. All this I have said to you in digression, 
in order that you at length may be persuaded of what has been declared against 
you by God, that you are foolish sons; and of this, 'Therefore, behold, I will 
proceed to take away this people, and shall take them away; and I will strip the 
wise of their wisdom, and will hide the understanding of their prudent men;' and 
may cease to deceive yourselves and those who hear you, and may learn of us, who 
have been taught wisdom by the grace of Christ. The words, then, which were 
spoken by David, are these: 'The Lord said unto My Lord, Sit Thou at My right 
hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. The Lord shall send the rod of 
Thy strength out of Sion: rule Thou also in the midst of Thine enemies. With 
Thee shall be, in the day, the chief of Thy power, in the beauties of Thy 
saints. From the womb, before the morning star, have I begotten Thee. The Lord 
hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of 
Melchizedek. The Lord is at Thy right hand: He has crushed kings in the day of 
His wrath: He shall judge among the heathen, He shall fill [with] the dead 
bodies. He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall He lift up the 
head.' 
CHAPTER XXXIII -- PS, CX. IS NOT SPOKEN OF HEZEKIAH. HE PROVES THAT CHRIST 
WAS FIRST HUMBLE, THEN SHALL BE GLORIOUS. 
"And," I continued, "I am not ignorant that you venture to expound this psalm 
as if it referred to king Hezekiah; but that you arc mistaken, I shall prove to 
you from these very words forthwith. 'The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent,' 
it is said; and, 'Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek,' 
with what follows and precedes. Not even you will venture to object that 
Hezekiah was either a priest, or is the everlasting priest of God; but that this 
is spoken of our Jesus, these expressions show. But your ears are shut up, and 
your hearts are made dull. For by this statement, 'The Lord hath sworn, and will 
not repent: Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek,' with an 
oath God has shown Him (on account of your unbelief) to be the High Priest after 
the order of Melchizedek; i.e., as Melchizedek was described by Moses as the 
priest of the Most High, and he was a priest of those who were in 
uncircumcision, and blessed the circumcised Abraham who brought him tithes, so 
God has shown that His everlasting Priest, called also by the Hold Spirit Lord, 
would be Priest of those in uncircumcision. Those too in circumcision who 
approach Him, that is, believing Him and seeking blessings from Him, He will 
both receive and bless. And that He shall be first humble as a man, and then 
exalted, these words at the end of the Psalm show: 'He shall drink of the brook 
in the way,' and then, 'Therefore shall He lift up the head.' 
CHAPTER XXXIV -- NOR DOES PS. LXXII. APPLY TO SOLOMON, WHOSE FAULTS 
CHRISTIANS SHUDDER AT. 
"Further, to persuade you that you have not understood anything of the 
Scriptures, I will remind you of another psalm, dictated to David by the Holy 
Spirit, which you say refers to Solomon, who was also your king. But it refers 
also to our Christ. But you deceive yourselves by the ambiguous forms of speech. 
For where it is said, 'The law of the Lord is perfect,' you do not understand it 
of the law which was to be after Moses, but of the law which was given by Moses, 
although God declared that He would establish a new law and a new covenant. And 
where it has been said, 'O God, give Thy judgment to the king,' since Solomon 
was king, you say that the Psalm refers to him, although the words of the Psalm 
expressly proclaim that reference is made to the everlasting King, i.e., to 
Christ. For Christ is King, and Priest, and God, and Lord, and angel, and man, 
and captain, and stone, and a Son born, and first made subject to suffering, 
then returning to heaven, and again coming with glory, and He is preached as 
having the everlasting kingdom: so I prove from all the Scriptures. But that you 
may perceive what I have said, I quote the words of the Psalm; they are these: 
'O God, give Thy judgment to the king, and Thy righteousness unto the king's 
son, to judge Thy people with righteousness, and Thy poor with judgment. The 
mountains shall take up peace to the people, and the little hills righteousness. 
He shall judge the poor of the people, and shah save the children of the needy, 
and shall abase the slanderer. He shall co-endure with the sun, and before the 
moon unto all generations. He shall come down like rain upon the fleece, as 
drops falling on the earth. In His days shall righteousness flourish, and 
abundance of peace until the moon be taken away. And He shall have dominion from 
sea to sea, and from the rivers unto the ends of the earth. Ethiopians shall 
fall down before Him, and His enemies shall lick the dust. The kings of Tarshish 
and the isles shall offer gifts; the kings of Arabia and Seba shall offer gifts; 
and all the kings of the earth shall worship Him, and all the nations shall 
serve Him: for He has delivered the poor from the man of power, and the needy 
that hath no helper. He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls 
of the needy: He shall redeem their souls from usury and injustice, and His name 
shall be honourable before them. And He shall live, and to Him shall be given of 
the gold of Arabia, and they shall pray continually for Him: they shall bless 
Him all the day. And there shall be a foundation on the earth, it shall be 
exalted on the tops of the mountains: His fruit shall be on Lebanon, and they of 
the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. His name shah be blessed for 
ever. His name shall endure before the sun; and all tribes of the earth shall be 
blessed in Him, all nations shall call Him blessed. Blessed be the Lord, the God 
of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things; and blessed be His glorious name for 
ever, and for ever and ever; and the whole earth shall be filled with His glory. 
Amen, amen.' And at the close of this Psalm which I have quoted, it is written, 
'The hymns of David the son of Jesse are ended.' Moreover, that Solomon was a 
renowned and great king, by whom the temple called that at Jerusalem was built, 
I know; but that none of those things mentioned in the Psalm happened to him, is 
evident. For neither did all kings worship him; nor did he reign to the ends of 
the earth; nor did his enemies, failing before him, lick the dust. Nay, also, I 
venture to repeat what is written in the book of Kings as committed by him, how 
through a woman's influence he worshipped the idols of Sidon, which those of the 
Gentiles who know God, the Maker of all things through Jesus the crucified, do 
not venture to do, but abide every torture and vengeance even to the extremity 
of death, rather than worship idols, or eat meat offered to idols." 
CHAPTER XXXV -- HERETICS CONFIRM THE CATHOLICS IN THE FAITH. 
And Trypho said, "I believe, however, that many of those who say that they 
confess Jesus, and are called Christians, eat meats offered to idols, and 
declare that they are by no means injured in consequence." And I replied, "The 
fact that there are such men confessing themselves to be Christians, and 
admitting the crucified Jesus to be both Lord and Christ, yet not teaching His 
doctrines, but those of the spirits of error, causes us who are disciples of the 
true and pure doctrine of Jesus Christ, to be more faithful and stedfast in the 
hope announced by Him. For what things He predicted would take place in His 
name, these we do see being actually accomplished in our sight. For he said, 
'Many shall come in My name, clothed outwardly in sheep's clothing, but inwardly 
they are ravening wolves." And, 'There shall be schisms and heresies.' And, 
'Beware of false prophets, who shall come to you clothed outwardly in sheep's 
clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.' And, 'Many false Christs and 
false apostles shall arise, and shall deceive many of the faithful.' There are, 
therefore, and there were many, my friends, who, coming forward in the name of 
Jesus, taught both to speak and act impious and blasphemous things; and these 
are called by us after the name of the men from whom each doctrine and opinion 
had its origin. (For some in one way, others in another, teach to blaspheme the 
Maker of all things, and Christ, who was foretold by Him as coming, and the God 
of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, with whom we have nothing in common, 
since we know them to be atheists, impious, unrighteous, and sinful, and 
confessors of Jesus in name only, instead of worshippers of Him. Yet they style 
themselves Christians, just as certain among the Gentiles inscribe the name of 
God upon the works of their own hands, and partake in nefarious and impious 
rites.) Some are called Marcians, and some Valentinians, and some Basilidians, 
and some Saturnilians, and others by other names; each called after the 
originator of the individual opinion, just as each one of those who consider 
themselves philosophers, as I said before, thinks he must bear the name of the 
philosophy which he follows, from the name of the father of the particular 
doctrine. So that, in consequence of these events, we know that Jesus foreknew 
what would happen after Him, as well as in consequence of many other events 
which He foretold would befall those who believed on and confessed Him, the 
Christ. For all that we suffer, even when killed by friends, He foretold would 
take place; so that it is manifest no word or act of His can be found fault 
with. Wherefore we pray for you and for all other men who hate us; in order that 
you, having repented along with us, may not blaspheme Him who, by His works, by 
the mighty deeds even now wrought through His name, by the words He taught, by 
the prophecies announced concerning Him, is the blameless, and in all things 
irreproachable, Christ Jesus; but, believing on Him, may be saved in His second 
glorious advent, and may not be condemned to fire by Him." 
CHAPTER XXXVI -- HE PROVES THAT CHRIST IS CALLED LORD OF HOSTS. 
Then he replied, "Let these things be so as you say--namely, that it was 
foretold Christ would suffer, and be called a stone; and after His first 
appearance, in which it had been announced He would suffer, would come in glory, 
and be Judge finally of all, and eternal King and Priest. Now show if this man 
be He of whom these prophecies were made." 
And I said, "As you wish, Trypho, I shall come to these proofs which you seek 
in the fitting place; but now you will permit me first to recount the 
prophecies, which I wish to do in order to prove that Christ is called both God 
and Lord of hosts, and Jacob, in parable by the Holy Spirit; and your 
interpreters, as God says, are foolish, since they say that reference is made to 
Solomon and not to Christ, when he bore the ark of testimony into the temple 
which he built. The Psalm of David is this: 'The earth is the Lord's, and the 
fulness thereof; the world, and all that dwell therein. He hath rounded it upon 
the seas, and prepared it upon the floods. Who shall ascend into the hill of the 
Lord? or who shall stand in His holy place? He that is clean of hands and pure 
of heart: who has not received his soul in vain, and has not sworn guilefully to 
his neighbour: he shall receive blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his 
Saviour. This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, that seek the face 
of the God of Jacob. Lift up your gates, ye rulers; and be ye lift up, ye 
everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of 
glory? The Lord strong and mighty in battle. Lift up your gates, ye rulers; and 
be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is 
this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.' Accordingly, it 
is shown that Solomon is not the Lord of hosts; but when our Christ rose from 
the dead and ascended to heaven, the rulers in heaven, under appointment of God, 
are commanded to open the gates of heaven, that He who is King of glory may 
enter in, and having ascended, may sit on the right hand of the Father until He 
make the enemies His footstool, as has been made manifest by another Psalm. For 
when the rulers of heaven saw Him of uncomely and dishonoured appearance, and 
inglorious, not recognising Him, they inquired, 'Who is this King of glory?' And 
the Holy Spirit, either from the person of His Father, or from His own person, 
answers them, 'The Lord of hosts, He is this King of glory.' For every one will 
confess that not one of those who presided over the gates of the temple at 
Jerusalem would venture to say concerning Solomon, though he was so glorious a 
king, or concerning the ark of testimony, 'Who is this King of glory?' 
CHAPTER XXXVII -- THE SAME IS PROVED FROM OTHER PSALMS. 
"Moreover, in the diapsalm of the forty-sixth Psalm, reference is thus made 
to Christ: 'God went up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet. Sing 
ye to our God, sing ye: sing to our King, sing ye; for God is King of all the 
earth: sing with understanding. God has ruled over the nations. God sits upon 
His holy throne. The rulers of the nations were assembled along with the God of 
Abraham, for the strong ones of God are greatly exalted on the earth.' And in 
the ninety-eighth Psalm, the Holy Spirit reproaches you, and predicts Him whom 
you do not wish to be king to be King and Lord, both of Samuel, and of Aaron, 
and of Moses, and, in short, of all the others. And the words of the Psalm are 
these: 'The Lord has reigned, let the nations be angry: [it is] He who sits upon 
the cherubim, let the earth be shaken. The Lord is great in Zion, and He is high 
above all the nations. Let them confess Thy great name, for it is fearful and 
holy, and the honour of the King loves judgment. Thou hast prepared equity; 
judgment and righteousness hast Thou performed in Jacob. Exalt the Lord our God, 
and worship the footstool of His feet; for He is holy. Moses and Aaron among His 
priests, and Samuel among those who call upon His name. They called (says the 
Scripture) on the Lord, and He heard them. In the pillar of the cloud He spake 
to them; for they kept His testimonies, and the commandment which he gave them. 
O Lord our God, Thou heardest them: O God, Thou wert propitious to them, and 
[yet] taking vengeance on all their inventions. Exalt the Lord our God, and 
worship at His holy hill; for the Lord our God is holy.'" 
CHAPTER XXXVIII -- IT IS AN ANNOYANCE TO THE JEW THAT CHRIST IS SAID TO BE 
ADORED. JUSTIN CONFIRMS IT, HOWEVER, FROM PS. XLV. 
And Trypho said, "Sir, it were good for us if we obeyed our teachers, who 
laid down a law that we should have no intercourse with any of you, and that we 
should not have even any communication with you on these questions. For you 
utter many blasphemies, in that you seek to persuade us that this crucified man 
was with Moses and Aaron, and spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud; then 
that he became man, was crucified, and ascended up to heaven, and comes again to 
earth, and ought to be worshipped." 
Then I answered, "I know that, as the word of God says, this great wisdom of 
God, the Maker of all things, and the Almighty, is hid from you. Wherefore, in 
sympathy with you, I am striving to the utmost that you may understand these 
matters which to you are paradoxical; but if not, that I myself may be innocent 
in the day of judgment. For you shall hear other words which appear still more 
paradoxical; but be not confounded, nay, rather remain still more zealous 
hearers and investigators, despising the tradition of your teachers, since they 
are convicted by the Holy Spirit of inability to perceive the truths taught by 
God, and of preferring to teach their own doctrines. Accordingly, in the 
forty-fourth [forty-fifth] Psalm, these words are in like manner referred to 
Christ: 'My heart has brought forth a good matter; I tell my works to the King. 
My tongue is the pen of a ready writer. Fairer in beauty than the sons of men: 
grace is poured forth into Thy lips: therefore bath God blessed Thee for ever. 
Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O mighty One. Press on in Thy fairness and in Thy 
beauty, and prosper and reign, because of truth, and of meekness, and of 
righteousness: and Thy right hand shall instruct Thee marvellously. Thine arrows 
are sharpened, O mighty One; the people shall fall under Thee; in the heart of 
the enemies of the King [the arrows are fixed]. Thy throne, O God, is for ever 
and ever: a sceptre of equity is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved 
righteousness, and hast hated iniquity; therefore thy God hath anointed Thee 
with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows. [He hath anointed Thee] with myrrh, 
and oil, and cassia, from Thy garments; from the ivory palaces, whereby they 
made Thee glad. Kings' daughters are in Thy honour. The queen stood at Thy right 
hand, clad in garments embroidered with gold. Hearken, O daughter, and behold, 
and incline thine ear, and forget thy people and the house of thy father: and 
the King shall desire thy beauty; because He is thy Lord, they shall worship Him 
also. And the daughter of Tyre [shall be there] with gifts. The rich of the 
people shall entreat Thy face. All the glory of the King's daughter within, clad 
in embroidered garments of needlework. The virgins that follow her shall be 
brought to the King; her neighbours shall be brought unto Thee: they shall be 
brought with joy and gladness: they shall be led into the King's shrine. Instead 
of thy fathers, thy sons have been born: Thou shalt appoint them rulers over all 
the earth. I shall remember Thy name in every generation: therefore the people 
shall confess Thee for ever, and for ever and ever.' 
CHAPTER XXXIX -- THE JEWS HATE THE CHRISTIANS WHO BELIEVE THIS. HOW GREAT THE 
DISTINCTION IS BETWEEN BOTH! 
"Now it is not surprising," I continued, "that you hate us who hold these 
opinions, and convict you of a continual hardness of heart. For indeed Elijah, 
conversing with God concerning you, speaks thus: 'Lord, they have slain Thy 
prophets, and digged down Thine altars: and I am left alone, and they seek my 
life.' And He answers him: 'I have still seven thousand men who have not bowed 
the knee to Baal.' Therefore, just as God did not inflict His anger on account 
of those seven thousand men, even so He has now neither yet inflicted judgment, 
nor does inflict it, knowing that daily some [of you] are becoming disciples in 
the name of Christ, and quitting the path of error; who are also receiving 
gifts, each as he is worthy, illumined through the name of this Christ. For one 
receives the spirit of understanding, another of counsel, another of strength, 
another of healing, another of foreknowledge, another of teaching, and another 
of the fear of God." 
To this Trypho said to me, "I wish you knew that you are beside yourself, 
talking these sentiments." 
And I said to him, "Listen, O friend, for I am not mad or beside myself; but 
it was prophesied that, after the ascent of Christ to heaven, He would deliver 
us from error and give us gifts. The words are these: 'He ascended up on high; 
He led captivity captive; He gave gifts to men.' Accordingly, we who have 
received gifts from Christ, who has ascended up on high, prove from the words of 
prophecy that you, 'the wise in yourselves, and the men of understanding in your 
own eyes,' are foolish, and honour God and His Christ by lip only. But we, who 
are instructed in the whole truth, honour Them both in acts, and in knowledge, 
and in heart, even unto death. But you hesitate to confess that He is Christ, as 
the Scriptures and the events witnessed and done in His name prove, perhaps for 
this reason, lest you be persecuted by the rulers, who, under the influence of 
the wicked and deceitful spirit, the serpent, will not cease putting to death 
and persecuting those who confess the name of Christ until He come again, and 
destroy them all, and render to each his deserts." 
And Trypho replied, "Now, then, render us the proof that this man who you say 
was crucified and ascended into heaven is the Christ of God. For you have 
sufficiently proved by means of the Scriptures previously quoted by you, that it 
is declared in the Scriptures that Christ must suffer, and come again with 
glory, and receive the eternal kingdom over all the nations, every kingdom being 
made subject to Him: now show us that this man is He." 
And I replied, "It has been already proved, sirs, to those who have ears, 
even from the facts which have been conceded by you; but that you may not think 
me at a loss, and unable to give proof of what you ask, as I promised, I shall 
do so at a fitting place. At present, I resume the consideration of the subject 
which I was discussing. 
CHAPTER XL -- HE RETURNS TO THE MOSAIC LAWS, AND PROVES THAT THEY WERE 
FIGURES OF THE THINGS WHICH PERTAIN TO CHRIST. 
"The mystery, then, of the lamb which God enjoined to be sacrificed as the 
passover, was a type of Christ; with whose blood, in proportion to their faith 
in Him, they anoint their houses, i.e., themselves, who believe on Him. For that 
the creation which God created--to wit, Adam--was a house for the spirit which 
proceeded from God, you all can understand. And that this injunction was 
temporary, I prove thus. God does not permit the lamb of the passover to be 
sacrificed in any other place than where His name was named; knowing that the 
days will come, after the suffering of Christ, when even the place in Jerusalem 
shall be given over to your enemies, and all the offerings, in short, shall 
cease; and that lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of 
the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, which is 
roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is 
transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the 
back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb. And the two goats which were 
ordered to be offered during the fast, of which one was sent away as the scape 
[goat], and the other sacrificed, were similarly declarative of the two 
appearances of Christ: the first, in which the elders of your people, and the 
priests, having laid hands on Him and put Him to death, sent Him away as the 
scope [goat]; and His second appearance, because in the same place in Jerusalem 
you shall recognise Him whom you have dishonoured, and who was an offering for 
all sinners willing to repent, and keeping the fast which Isaiah speaks of, 
loosening the terms of the violent contracts, and keeping the other precepts, 
likewise enumerated by him, and which I have quoted, which those believing in 
Jesus do. And further, you are aware that the offering of the two goats, which 
were enjoined to be sacrificed at the fast, was not permitted to take place 
similarly anywhere else, but only in Jerusalem. 
CHAPTER XLI -- THE OBLATION OF FINE FLOUR WAS A FIGURE OF THE EUCHARIST. 
"And the offering of fine flour, sirs," I said, "which was prescribed to be 
presented on behalf of those purified from leprosy, was a type of the bread of 
the Eucharist, the celebration of which our Lord Jesus Christ prescribed, in 
remembrance of the suffering which He endured on behalf of those who are 
purified in soul from all iniquity, in order that we may at the same time thank 
God for having created the world, with all things therein, for the sake of man, 
and for delivering us from the evil in which we were, and for utterly 
overthrowing principalities and powers by Him who suffered according to His 
will. Hence God speaks by the mouth of Malachi, one of the twelve [prophets], as 
I said before, about the sacrifices at that time presented by you: 'I have no 
pleasure in you, saith the Lord; and I will not accept your sacrifices at your 
hands: for, from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, My name 
has been glorified among the Gentiles, and in every place incense is offered to 
My name, and a pure offering: for My name is great among the Gentiles, saith the 
Lord: but ye profane it.' He then speaks of those Gentiles, namely us, who in 
every place offer sacrifices to Him, i.e., the bread of the Eucharist, and also 
the cup of the Eucharist, affirming both that we glorify His name, and that you 
profane . The command of circumcision, again, bidding [them] always circumcise 
the children on the eighth day, was a type of the true circumcision, by which we 
are circumcised from deceit and iniquity through Him who rose from the dead on 
the first day after the Sabbath, [namely through] our Lord Jesus Christ. For the 
first day after the Sabbath, remaining the first of all the days, is called, 
however, the eighth, according to the number of all the days of the cycle, and 
[yet] remains the first. 
CHAPTER XLII -- THE BELLS ON THE PRIEST'S ROBE WERE A FIGURE OF THE APOSTLES. 

"Moreover, the prescription that twelve bells be attached to the [robe] of 
the high priest, which hung down to the feet, was a symbol of the twelve 
apostles, who depend on the power of Christ, the eternal Priest; and through 
their voice it is that all the earth has been filled with the glory and grace of 
God and of His Christ. Wherefore David also says: 'Their sound has gone forth 
into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.' And Isaiah speaks 
as if he were personating the apostles, when they say to Christ that they 
believe not in their own report, but in the power of Him who sent them. And so 
he says: 'Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord 
revealed? We have preached before Him as if [He were] a child, as if a root in a 
dry ground.' (And what follows in order of the prophecy already quoted.) But 
when the passage speaks as from the lips of many, 'We have preached before Him,' 
and adds, 'as if a child,' it signifies that the wicked shall become subject to 
Him, and shall obey His command, and that all shall become as one child. Such a 
thing as you may witness in the body: although the members are enumerated as 
many, all are called one, and are a body. For, indeed, a 
commonwealth and a church, though many individuals in number, are in fact as 
one, called and addressed by one appellation. And in short, sirs," said I, "by 
enumerating all the other appointments of Moses I can demonstrate that they were 
types, and symbols, and declarations of those things which would happen to 
Christ, of those who it was foreknown were to believe in Him, and of those 
things which would also be done by Christ Himself. But since what I have now 
enumerated appears to me to be sufficient, I revert again to the order of the 
discourse. 
CHAPTER XLIII -- HE CONCLUDES THAT THE LAW HAD AN END IN CHRIST, WHO WAS BORN 
OF THE VIRGIN. 
"As, then, circumcision began with Abraham, and the Sabbath and sacrifices 
and offerings and feasts with Moses, and it has been proved they were enjoined 
on account of the hardness of your people's heart, so it was necessary, in 
accordance with the Father's will, that they should have an end in Him who was 
born of a virgin, of the family of Abraham and tribe of Judah, and of David; in 
Christ the Son of God, who was proclaimed as about to come to all the world, to 
be the everlasting law and the everlasting covenant, even as the forementioned 
prophecies show. And we, who have approached God through Him, have received not 
carnal, but spiritual circumcision, which Enoch and those like him observed. And 
we have received it through baptism, since we were sinners, by God's mercy; and 
all men may equally obtain it. But since the mystery of His birth now demands 
our attention I shall speak of it. Isaiah then asserted in regard to the 
generation of Christ, that it could not be declared by man, in words already 
quoted: 'Who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth: 
for the transgressions of my people was He led to death.' The Spirit of prophecy 
thus affirmed that the generation of Him who was to die, that we sinful men 
might be healed by His stripes, was such as could not be declared. Furthermore, 
that the men who believe in Him may possess the knowledge of the manner in which 
He came into the world, the Spirit of prophecy by the same Isaiah foretold how 
it would happen thus: 'And the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying, Ask for thyself 
a sign from the Lord thy God, in the depth, or in the height. And Ahaz said, I 
will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. And Isaiah said, Hear then, O house 
of David; Is it a small thing for you to contend with men, and how do you 
contend with the Lord? Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign. Behold, 
the virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and his name shall be called 
Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, before he knows or prefers the evil, 
and chooses out the good; for before the child knows good or ill, he rejects 
evil by choosing out the good. For before the child knows how to call father or 
mother, he shall receive the power of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria in 
presence of the king of Assyria. And the land shall be forsaken, which thou 
shalt with difficulty endure in consequence of the presence of its two kings. 
But God shall bring on thee, and on thy people, and on the house of thy father, 
days which have not yet come upon thee since the day in which Ephraim took away 
from Judah the king of Assyria.' Now it is evident to all, that in the race of 
Abraham according to the flesh no one has been born of a virgin, or is said to 
have been born [of a virgin], save this our Christ. But since you and your 
teachers venture to affirm that in the prophecy of Isaiah it is not said, 
'Behold, the virgin shall conceive,' but, 'Behold, the young woman shall 
conceive, and bear a son;' and [since] you explain the prophecy as if [it 
referred] to Hezekiah, who was your king, I shall endeavor to [discuss shortly 
this point in opposition to you, and to show that reference is made to Him who 
is acknowledged by us as Christ. 
CHAPTER XLIV -- THE JEWS IN VAIN PROMISE THEMSELVES SALVATION, WHICH CANNOT 
BE OBTAINED EXCEPT THROUGH CHRIST. 
"For thus, so far as you are concerned, I shall be found in all respects 
innocent, if I strive earnestly to persuade you by bringing forward 
demonstrations. But if you remain hard-hearted, or weak in [forming] a 
resolution, on account of death, which is the lot of the Christians, and are 
unwilling to assent to the truth, you shall appear as the authors of your own 
[evils]. And you deceive yourselves while you fancy that, because you are the 
seed of Abraham after the flesh, therefore you shall fully inherit the good 
things announced to be bestowed by God through Christ. For no one, not even of 
them, has anything to look for, but only those who in mind are assimilated to 
the faith of Abraham, and who have recognised all the mysteries: for I say, that 
some injunctions were laid on you in reference to the worship of God and 
practice of righteousness; but some injunctions and acts were likewise mentioned 
in reference to the mystery of Christ, on account of the hardness of your 
people's hearts. And that this is so, God makes known in Ezekiel, [when] He said 
concerning it: 'If Noah and Jacob and Daniel should beg either sons or 
daughters, the request would not be granted them.' And in Isaiah, of the very 
same matter He spake thus: 'The Lord God said, they shall both go forth and look 
on the members [of the bodies] of the men that have transgressed. For their worm 
shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be a 
gazing-stock to all flesh.' So that it becomes you to eradicate this hope from 
your souls, and hasten to know in what way forgiveness of sins, and a hope of 
inheriting the promised good things, shall be yours. But there is no other [way] 
than this,--to become acquainted with this Christ, to be washed in the fountain 
spoken of by Isaiah for the remission of sins; and for the rest, to live sinless 
lives." 
CHAPTER XLV -- THOSE WHO WERE RIGHTEOUS BEFORE AND UNDER THE LAW SHALL BE 
SAVED BY CHRIST. 
And Trypho said, "If I seem to interrupt these matters, which you say must be 
investigated, yet the question which I mean to put is urgent. Suffer me first." 
And I replied, "Ask whatever you please, as it occurs to you; and I shall 
endeavour, after questions and answers, to resume and complete the discourse." 
Then he said, "Tell me, then, shall those who lived according to the law 
given by Moses, live in the same manner with Jacob, Enoch, and Noah, in the 
resurrection of the dead, or not?" 
I replied to him, "When I quoted, sir, the words spoken by Ezekiel, that 
'even if Noah and Daniel and Jacob were to beg sons and daughters, the request 
would not be granted them,' but that each one, that is to say, shall be saved by 
his own righteousness, I said also, that those who regulated their lives by the 
law of Moses would in like manner be saved. For what in the law of Moses is 
naturally good, and pious, and righteous, and has been prescribed to be done by 
those who obey it; and what was appointed to be performed by reason of the 
hardness of the people's hearts; was similarly recorded, and done also by those 
who were under the law. Since those who did that which is universally, 
naturally, and eternally good are pleasing to God, they shall be saved through 
this Christ in the resurrection equally with those righteous men who were before 
them, namely Noah, and Enoch, and Jacob, and whoever else there be, along with 
those who have known this Christ, Son of God, who was before the morning star 
and the moon, and submitted to become incarnate, and be born of this virgin of 
the family of David, in order that, by this dispensation, the serpent that 
sinned from the beginning, and the angels like him, may be destroyed, and that 
death may be contemned, and for ever quit, at the second coming of the Christ 
Himself, those who believe in Him and live acceptably,--and be no more: when 
some are sent to be punished unceasingly into judgment and condemnation of fire; 
but others shall exist in freedom from suffering, from corruption, and from 
grief, and in immortality." 
CHAPTER XLVI -- TRYPHO ASKS WHETHER A MAN WHO KEEPS THE LAW EVEN NOW WILL BE 
SAVED. JUSTIN PROVES THAT IT CONTRIBUTES NOTHING TO RIGHTEOUSNESS. 
"But if some, even now, wish to live in the observance of the institutions 
given by Moses, and yet believe in this Jesus who was crucified, recognising Him 
to be the Christ of God, and that it is given to Him to be absolute Judge of 
all, and that His is the everlasting kingdom, can they also be saved?" he 
inquired of me. 
And I replied, "Let us consider that also together, whether one may now 
observe all the Mosaic institutions." 
And he answered, "No. For we know that, as you said, it is not possible 
either anywhere to sacrifice the lamb of the passover, or to offer the goats 
ordered for the fast; or, in short, [to present] all the other offerings." 
And I said, "Tell then yourself, I pray, some things which can be observed; 
for you will be persuaded that, though a man does not keep or has not performed 
the eternal decrees, he may assuredly be saved." 
Then he replied, "To keep the Sabbath, to be circumcised, to observe months, 
and to be washed if you touch anything prohibited by Moses, or after sexual 
intercourse." 
And I said, "Do you think that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Noah, and Job, and all 
the rest before or after them equally righteous, also Sarah the wife of Abraham, 
Rebekah the wife of Isaac, Rachel the wife of Jacob, and Leah, and all the rest 
of them, until the mother of Moses the faithful servant, who observed none of 
these [statutes], will be saved?" 
And Trypho answered, "Were not Abraham and his descendants circumcised?" 
And I said, "I know that Abraham and his descendants were circumcised. The 
reason why circumcision was given to them I stated at length in what has gone 
before; and if what has been said does not convince you, let us again search 
into the matter. But you are aware that, up to Moses, no one in fact who was 
righteous observed any of these rites at all of which we are talking, or 
received one commandment to observe, except that of circumcision, which began 
from Abraham." 
And he replied, "We know it, and admit that they are saved." 
Then I returned answer, "You perceive that God by Moses laid all such 
ordinances upon you on account of the hardness of your people's hearts, in order 
that, by the large number of them, you might keep God continually, and in every 
action, before your eyes, and never begin to act unjustly or impiously. For He 
enjoined you to place around you [a fringe] of purple dye, in order that you 
might not forget God; and He commanded you to wear a phylactery, certain 
characters, which indeed we consider holy, being engraved on very thin 
parchment; and by these means stirring you up to retain a constant remembrance 
of God: at the same time, however, convincing you, that in your hearts you have 
not even a faint remembrance of God's worship. Yet not even so were you 
dissuaded from idolatry: for in the times of Elijah, when [God] recounted the 
number of those who had not bowed the knee to Baal, He said the number was seven 
thousand; and in Isaiah He rebukes you for having sacrificed your children to 
idols. But we, because we refuse to sacrifice to those to whom we were of old 
accustomed to sacrifice, undergo extreme penalties, and rejoice in 
death,--believing that God will raise us up by His Christ, and will make us 
incorruptible, and undisturbed, and immortal; and we know that the ordinances 
imposed by reason of the hardness of your people's hearts, contribute nothing to 
the performance of righteousness and of piety." 
CHAPTER XLVII -- JUSTIN COMMUNICATES WITH CHRISTIANS WHO OBSERVE THE LAW. NOT 
A FEW CATHOLICS DO OTHERWISE. 
And Trypho again inquired, "But if some one, knowing that this is so, after 
he recognises that this man is Christ, and has believed in and obeys Him, 
wishes, however, to observe these [institutions], will he be saved?" 
I said, "In my opinion, Trypho, such an one will be saved, if he does not 
strive in every way to persuade other men,--I mean those Gentiles who have been 
circumcised from error by Christ, to observe the same things as himself, telling 
them that they will not be saved unless they do so. This you did yourself at the 
commencement of the discourse, when you declared that I would not be saved 
unless I observe these institutions." 
Then he replied, "Why then have you said, 'In my opinion, such an one will be 
saved,' unless there are some who affirm that such will not be saved?" 
"There are such people, Trypho," I answered; "and these do not venture to 
have any intercourse with or to extend hospitality to such persons; but I do not 
agree with them. But if some, through weak-mindedness, wish to observe such 
institutions as were given by Moses, from which they expect some virtue, but 
which we believe were appointed by reason of the hardness of the people's 
hearts, along with their hope in this Christ, and [wish to perform] the eternal 
and natural acts of righteousness and piety, yet choose to live with the 
Christians and the faithful, as I said before, not inducing them either to be 
circumcised like themselves, or to keep the Sabbath, or to observe any other 
such ceremonies, then I hold that we ought to join ourselves to such, and 
associate with them in all things as kinsmen and brethren. But if, Trypho," I 
continued, "some of your race, who say they believe in this Christ, compel those 
Gentiles who believe in this Christ to live in all respects according to the law 
given by Moses, or choose not to associate so intimately with them, I in like 
manner do not approve of them. But I believe that even those, who have been 
persuaded by them to observe the legal dispensation along with their confession 
of God in Christ, shall probably be saved. And I hold, further, that such as 
have confessed and known this man to be Christ, yet who have gone back from some 
cause to the legal dispensation, and have denied that this man is Christ, and 
have repented not before death, shall by no means be saved. Further, I hold that 
those of the seed of Abraham who live according to the law, and do not believe 
in this Christ before death, shall likewise not be saved, and especially those 
who have anathematized and do anathematize this very Christ in the synagogues, 
and everything by which they might obtain salvation and escape the vengeance of 
fire. For the goodness and the loving-kindness of God, and His boundless riches, 
hold righteous and sinless the man who, as Ezekiel tells, repents of sins; and 
reckons sinful, unrighteous, and impious the man who fails away from piety and 
righteousness to unrighteousness and ungodliness. Wherefore also our Lord Jesus 
Christ said, 'In whatsoever things I shall take you, in these I shall judge 
you.' " 
CHAPTER XLVIII -- BEFORE THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST IS PROVED, HE [TRYPHO] 
DEMANDS THAT IT BE SETTLED THAT HE IS CHRIST. 
And Trypho said, "We have heard what you think of these matters. Resume the 
discourse where you left off, and bring it to an end. For some of it appears to 
me to be paradoxical, and wholly incapable of proof. For when you say that this 
Christ existed as God before the ages, then that He submitted to be born and 
become man, yet that He is not man of man, this[assertion] appears to me to be 
not merely paradoxical, but also foolish." 
And I replied to this, "I know that the statement does appear to be 
paradoxical, especially to those of your race, who are ever unwilling to 
understand or to perform the[requirements] of God, but[ready to perform] those 
of your teachers, as God Himself declares. Now assuredly, Trypho," I 
continued,"[the proof] that this man is the Christ of God does not fail, though 
I be unable to prove that He existed formerly as Son of the Maker of all things, 
being God, and was born a man by the Virgin. But since I have certainly proved 
that this man is the Christ of God, whoever He be, even if I do not prove that 
He pre-existed, and submitted to be born a man of like passions with us, having 
a body, according to the Father's will; in this last matter alone is it just to 
say that I have erred, and not to deny that He is the Christ, though it should 
appear that He was born man of men, and[nothing more] is proved[than this], that 
He has become Christ by election. For there are some, my friends," I said, "of 
our race, who admit that He is Christ, while holding Him to be man of men; with 
whom I do not agree, nor would I, even though most of those who have[now] the 
same opinions as myself should say so; since we were enjoined by Christ Himself 
to put no faith in human doctrines, but in those proclaimed by the blessed 
prophets and taught by Himself." 
CHAPTER XLIX -- TO THOSE WHO OBJECT THAT ELIJAH HAS NOT YET COME, HE REPLIES 
THAT HE IS THE PRECURSOR OF THE FIRST ADVENT. 
And Trypho said, "Those who affirm him to have been a man, and to have been 
anointed by election, and then to have become Christ, appear to me to speak more 
plausibly than you who hold those opinions which you express. For we all expect 
that Christ will be a man[born] of men, and that Elijah when he comes will 
anoint him. But if this man appear to be Christ, he must certainly be known as 
man[born] of men; but from the circumstance that Elijah has not yet come, I 
infer that this man is not He[the Christ]." 
Then I inquired of him, "Does not Scripture, in the book of Zechariah, say 
that Elijah shall come before the great and terrible day of the Lord?" 
And he answered, "Certainly." 
"If therefore Scripture compels you to admit that two advents of Christ were 
predicted to take place,--one in which He would appear suffering, and 
dishonoured, and without comeliness; but the other in which He would come 
glorious. and Judge of all, as has been made manifest in many of the forecited 
passages,--shall we not suppose that the word of God has proclaimed that Elijah 
shall be the precursor of the great and terrible day, that is, of His second 
advent?" 
"Certainly," he answered. 
"And, accordingly, our Lord in His teaching," I continued, "proclaimed that 
this very thing would take place, saying that Elijah would also come. And we 
know that this shall take place when our Lord Jesus Christ shall come in glory 
from heaven; whose first manifestation the Spirit of God who was in Elijah 
preceded as herald in[the person of] John, a prophet among your nation; after 
whom no other prophet appeared among you. He cried, as he sat by the river 
Jordan: 'I baptize you with water to repentance; but He that is stronger than I 
shall come, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the 
Holy Ghost and with fire: whose fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge 
His floor, and will gather the wheat into the barn; but the chaff He will burn 
up with unquenchable fire.' And this very prophet your king Herod had shut up in 
prison; and when his birthday was celebrated, and the niece of the same Herod by 
her dancing had pleased him, he told her to ask whatever she pleased. Then the 
mother of the maiden instigated her to ask the head of John, who was in prison; 
and having asked it,[Herod] sent and ordered the head of John to be brought in 
on a charger. Wherefore also our Christ said,[when He was] on earth, to those 
who were affirming that Elijah must come before Christ: 'Elijah shall come, and 
restore all things; but I say unto you, that Elijah has already come, and they 
knew him not, but have done to him whatsoever they chose.' And it is written, 
'Then the disciples understood that He spake to them about John the Baptist.' " 
And Trypho said, "This statement also seems to me paradoxical; namely, that 
the prophetic Spirit of God, who was in Elijah, was also in John." 
To this I replied, "Do you not think that the same thing happened in the case 
of Joshua the son of Nave(Nun), who succeeded to the command of the people after 
Moses, when Moses was commanded to lay his hands on Joshua, and God said to him, 
I will take of the spirit which is in thee, and put it on him?' " 
And he said, "Certainly." 
"As therefore," I say, "while Moses was still among men, God took of the 
spirit which was in Moses and put it on Joshua, even so God was able to 
cause[the spirit] of Elijah to come upon John; in order that, as Christ at His 
first coming appeared inglorious, even so the first coming of the spirit, which 
remained always pure in Elijah s like that of Christ, might be perceived to be 
inglorious. For the Lord said He would wage war against Amalek with concealed 
hand; and you will not deny that Amalek fell. But if it is said that only in the 
glorious advent of Christ war will be waged with Amalek, how great will the 
fulfilment of Scripture be which says, 'God will wage war against Amalek with 
concealed hand!' You can perceive that the concealed power of God was in Christ 
the crucified, before whom demons, and all the principalities and powers of the 
earth, tremble." 
CHAPTER L -- IT IS PROVED FROM ISAIAH THAT JOHN IS THE PRECURSOR OF CHRIST. 
And Trypho said, "You seem to me to have come out of a great conflict with 
many persons about all the points we have been searching into, and therefore 
quite ready to return answers to all questions put to you. Answer me then, 
first, how you can show that there is another God besides the Maker of all 
things; and then you will show,[further], that He submitted to be born of the 
Virgin." 
I replied, "Give me permission first of all to quote certain passages from 
the prophecy of Isaiah, which refer to the office of forerunner discharged by 
John the Baptist and prophet before this our Lord Jesus Christ." 
"I grant it," said he. 
Then I said, "Isaiah thus foretold John's forerunning: 'And Hezekiah said to 
Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which He spake: Let there be peace and 
righteousness in my days.' And, 'Encourage the people; ye priests, speak to the 
heart of Jerusalem, and encourage her, because her humiliation is accomplished. 
Her sin is annulled; for she has received of the Lord's hand double for her 
sins. A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the ways of the Lord; 
make straight the paths of our God. Every valley shall be filled up, and every 
mountain and hill shall be brought low: and the crooked shall be made straight, 
and the rough way shall be plain ways; and the glory of the Lord thall be seen, 
and all flesh shall see the salvation of God: for the Lord hath spoken it. A 
voice of one saying, Cry; and I said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and 
all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass has withered, and the 
flower of it has fallen away; but the word of the Lord endureth for ever. Thou 
that bringest good tidings to Zion, go up to the high mountain; thou that 
bringest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength. Lift ye up, 
be not afraid; tell the cities of Judah, Behold your God! Behold, the Lord comes 
with strength, and[His] arm comes with authority. Behold, His reward is with 
Him, and His work before Him. As a shepherd He will tend His flock, and will 
gather the lambs with[His] arm, and cheer on her that is with young. Who has 
measured the water with[his] hand, and the heaven with a span, and all the earth 
with[his] fist? Who has weighed the mountains, and[put] the valleys into a 
balance? Who has known the mind of the Lord? And who has been His counsellor, 
and who shall advise Him? Or with whom did He take counsel, and he instructed 
Him? Or who showed Him judgment? Or who made Him to know the way of 
understanding? All the nations are reckoned as a drop of a bucket, and as a 
turning of a balance, and shall be reckoned as spittle. But Lebanon is not 
sufficient to burn, nor the beasts sufficient for a burnt-offering; and all the 
nations are considered nothing, and for nothing.' " 
CHAPTER LI -- IT IS PROVED THAT THIS PROPHECY HAS BEEN FULFILLED. 
And when I ceased, Trypho said, "All the words of the prophecy you repeat, 
sir, are ambiguous, and have no force in proving what you wish to prove." Then I 
answered, "If the prophets had not ceased, so that there were no more in your 
nation, Trypho, after this John, it is evident that what I say in reference to 
Jesus Christ might be regarded perhaps as ambiguous. But if John came first 
calling on men to repent, and Christ, while[John] still sat by the river Jordan, 
having come, put an end to his prophesying and baptizing, and preached also 
Himself, saying that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and that He must suffer 
many things from the Scribes and Pharisees, and be crucified, and on the third 
day rise again, and would appear again in Jerusalem, and would again eat and 
drink with His disciples; and foretold that in the interval between His[first 
and second] advent, as I previously said, priests and false prophets would arise 
in His name, which things do actually appear; then how can they be ambiguous, 
when you may be persuaded by the facts? Moreover, He referred to the fact that 
there would be no longer in your nation any prophet, and to the fact that men 
recognised how that the New Testament, which God formerly announced[His 
intention of] promulgating, was then present, i.e., Christ Himself; and in the 
following terms: 'The law and the prophets were until John the Baptist; from 
that time the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by 
force. And if you can receive it, he is Elijah, who was to come. He that hath 
ears to hear, let him hear.' 
CHAPTER LII -- JACOB PREDICTED TWO ADVENTS OF CHRIST. 
"And it was prophesied by Jacob the patriarch that there would be two advents 
of Christ, and that in the first He would suffer, and that after He came there 
would be neither prophet nor king in your nation(I proceeded), and that the 
nations who believed in the suffering Christ would look for His future 
appearance. And for this reason the Holy Spirit had uttered these truths in a 
parable, and obscurely: for," I added, "it is said, 'Judah, thy brethren have 
praised thee: thy hands[shall be] on the neck of thine enemies; the sons of thy 
father shall worship thee. Judah is a lion's whelp; from the germ, my son, thou 
art sprung up. Reclining, he lay down like a lion, and like [a lion's] whelp: 
who shall raise him up? A ruler shall not depart from Judah, or a leader from 
his thighs, until that which is laid up in store for him shah come; and he shall 
be the desire of nations, binding his foal to the vine, and the foal of his ass 
to the tendril of the vine. He shall wash his garments in wine, and his vesture 
in the blood of the grape. His eyes shall be bright with s wine, and his teeth 
white like milk.' Moreover, that in your nation there never failed either 
prophet or ruler, from the time when they began until the time when this Jesus 
Christ appeared and suffered, you will not venture shamelessly to assert, nor 
can you prove it. For though you affirm that Herod, after whose[reign] He 
suffered, was an Ashkelonite, nevertheless you admit that there was a high 
priest in your nation; so that you then had one who presented offerings 
according to the law of Moses, and observed the other legal ceremonies; also[you 
had] prophets in succession until John,(even then, too, when your nation was 
carried captive to Babylon, when your land was ravaged by war, and the sacred 
vessels carried off); there never failed to be a prophet among you, who was 
lord, and leader, and ruler of your nation. For the Spirit which was in the 
prophets anointed your kings, and established them. But after the manifestation 
and death of our Jesus Christ in your nation, there was and is nowhere any 
prophet: nay, further, you ceased to exist under your own king, your land was 
laid waste, and forsaken like a lodge m a vineyard; and the statement of 
Scripture, in the mouth of Jacob, 'And He shall be the desire of nations,' meant 
symbolically His two advents, and that the nations would believe in Him; which 
facts you may now at length discern. For those out of all the nations who are 
pious and righteous through the faith of Christ, look for His future appearance. 

CHAPTER LIII -- JACOB PREDICTED THAT CHRIST WOULD RIDE ON AN ASS, AND 
ZECHARIAH CONFIRMS IT. 
"And that expression, 'binding his foal to the vine, and the ass's foal to 
the vine tendril,' was a declaring beforehand both of the works wrought by Him 
at His first advent, and also of that belief in Him which the nations would 
repose. For they were like an unharnessed foal, which was not bearing a yoke on 
its neck, until this Christ came, and sent His disciples to instruct them; and 
they bore the yoke of His word, and yielded the neck to endure all[hardships], 
for the sake of the good things promised by Himself, and expected by them. And 
truly our Lord Jesus Christ, when He intended to go into Jerusalem, requested 
His disciples to bring Him a certain ass, along with its foal, which was bound 
in an entrance of a village called Bethphage; and having seated Himself on it, 
He entered into Jerusalem. And as this was done by Him in the manner in which it 
was prophesied in precise terms that it would be done by the Christ, and as the 
fulfilment was recognised, it became a clear proof that He was the Christ. And 
though all this happened and is proved from Scripture, you are still 
hard-hearted. Nay, it was prophesied by Zechariah, one of the twelve[prophets], 
that such would take place, in the following words: 'Rejoice greatly, daughter 
of Zion; shout, and declare, daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy King shall come 
to thee, righteous, bringing salvation, meek, and lowly, riding on an ass, and 
the foal of an ass.' Now, that the Spirit of prophecy, as well as the patriarch 
Jacob, mentioned both an ass and its foal, which would be used by Him; and, 
further, that He, as I previously said, requested His disciples to bring both 
beasts;[this fact] was a prediction that you of the synagogue, along with the 
Gentiles, would believe in Him. For as the unharnessed colt was a symbol of the 
Gentiles even so the harnessed ass was a symbol of your nation. For you possess 
the law which was imposed[upon you] by the prophets. Moreover, the prophet 
Zechariah foretold that this same Christ would be smitten, and His disciples 
scattered: which also took place. For after His crucifixion, the disciples that 
accompanied Him were dispersed, until He rose from the dead, and persuaded them 
that so it had been prophesied concerning Him, that He would suffer; and being 
thus persuaded, they went into all the world, and taught these truths. Hence 
also we are strong in His faith and doctrine, since we have[this our] persuasion 
both from the prophets, and from those who throughout the world are seen to be 
worshippers of God in the name of that crucified One. The following is said, 
too, by Zechariah: 'O sword, rise up against My Shepherd, and against the man of 
My people, saith the Lord of hosts. Smite the Shepherd, and His flock shall be 
scattered.' CHAP, LIV -- WHAT THE BLOOD OF THE GRAPE SIGNIFIES. 
"And that expression which was committed to writing by Moses, and prophesied 
by the patriarch Jacob, namely, 'He shall wash His garments with wine, and His 
vesture with the blood of the grape,' signified that He would wash those that 
believe in Him with His own blood. For the Holy Spirit called those who receive 
remission of sins through Him, His garments; amongst whom He is always present 
in power, but will be manifestly present at His second coming. That the 
Scripture mentions the blood of the grape has been evidently designed, because 
Christ derives blood not from the seed of man, but from the power of God. For as 
God, and not man, has produced the blood of the vine, so also[the Scripture] has 
predicted that the blood of Christ would be not of the seed of man, but of the 
power of God. But this prophecy, sirs, which I repeated, proves that Christ is 
not man of men, begotten in the ordinary course of humanity." 
CHAPTER LV -- TRYPHO ASKS THAT CHRIST BE PROVED GOD, BUT WITHOUT METAPHOR. 
JUSTIN PROMISES TO DO SO. 
And Trypho answered, "We shall remember this your exposition, if you 
strengthen[your solution of] this difficulty by other arguments: but now resume 
the discourse, and show us that the Spirit of prophecy admits another God sides 
the Maker of all things, taking care not to speak of the sun and moon, which, it 
is written, God has given to the nations to worship as gods; and oftentimes the 
prophets, employing this manner of speech, say that 'thy God is a God of gods, 
and a Lord of lords,' adding frequently, 'the great and strong and 
terrible[God].' For such expressions are used, not as if they really were gods, 
but because the Scripture is teaching us that the true God, who made all things, 
is Lord alone of those who are reputed gods and lords. And in order that the 
Holy Spirit may convince of this, He said by the holy David, 'The gods of the 
nations, reputed gods, are idols of demons, and not gods;' and He denounces a 
curse on those who worship them." 
And I replied, "I would not bring forward these proofs, Trypho, by which I am 
aware those who worship these[idols] and such like are condemned, but 
such[proofs] as no one could find any objection to. They will appear strange to 
you, although you read them every day; so that even from this fact we understand 
that, because of your wickedness, God has withheld from you the ability to 
discern the wisdom of His Scriptures; yet[there are] some exceptions, to whom, 
according to the grace of His long-suffering, as Isaiah said, He has left a seed 
of salvation, lest your race be utterly destroyed, like Sodom and Gomorrah. Pay 
attention, therefore, to what I shall record out of the holy Scriptures, which 
do not need to be expounded, but only listened to. 
CHAPTER LVI -- GOD WHO APPEARED TO MOSES IS DISTINGUISHED FROM GOD THE 
FATHER. 
"Moses, then, the blessed and faithful servant of God, declares that He who 
appeared to Abraham under the oak in Mamre is God, sent with the two angels in 
His company to judge Sodom by Another who remains ever in the supercelestial 
places, invisible to all men, holding personal intercourse with none, whom we 
believe to be Maker and Father of all things; for he speaks thus: 'God appeared 
to him under the oak in Mature, as he sat at his tent-door at noontide. And 
lifting up his eyes, he saw, and behold, three men stood before him; and when he 
saw them, he ran to meet them from the door of his tent; and he bowed himself 
toward the ground, and said;' "(and so on;) " 'Abraham gat up early in the 
morning to the place where he stood before the Lord: and he looked toward Sodom 
and Gomorrah, and toward the adjacent country, and beheld, and, lo, a flame went 
up from the earth, like the smoke of a furnace.'" And when I had made an end of 
quoting these words, I asked them if they had understood them. 
And they said they had understood them, but that the passages adduced brought 
forward no proof that there is any other God or Lord, or that the Holy Spirit 
says so, besides the Maker of all things. 
Then I replied, "I shall attempt to persuade you, since you have understood 
the Scriptures,[of the truth] of what I say, that there is, and that there is 
said to be, another God and Lord subject to the Maker of all things; who is also 
called an Angel, because He announces to men whatsoever the Maker of all 
things--above whom there is no other God--wishes to announce to them." And 
quoting once more the previous passage, I asked Trypho, "Do you think that God 
appeared to Abraham under the oak in Mature, as the Scripture asserts?" 
He said, "Assuredly." 
"Was He one of those three," I said, "whom Abraham saw, and whom the Holy 
Spirit of prophecy describes as men?" 
He said, "No; but God appeared to him, before the vision of the three. Then 
those three whom the Scripture calls men, were angels; two of them sent to 
destroy Sodom, and one to announce the joyful tidings to Sarah, that she would 
bear a son; for which cause he was sent, and having accomplished his errand, 
went away." 
"How then," said I, "does the one of the three, who was in the tent, and who 
said, 'I shall return to thee hereafter, and Sarah shall have a son,' appear to 
have returned when Sarah had begotten a son, and to be there declared, by the 
prophetic word, God? But that you may clearly discern what I say, listen to the 
words expressly employed by Moses; they are these: 'And Sarah saw the son of 
Hagar the Egyptian bond-woman, whom she bore to Abraham, sporting with Isaac her 
son, and said to Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman and her son; for the son of 
this bond-woman shall not share the inheritance of my son Isaac. And the matter 
seemed very grievous in Abraham's sight, because of his son. But God said to 
Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the son, and because of 
the bond-woman. In all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken to her voice; for 
in Isaac shall thy seed be called.' Have you perceived, then, that He who said 
under the oak that He would return, since He knew it would be necessary to 
advise Abraham to do what Sarah wished him, came back as it is written; and is 
God, as the words declare, when they so speak: 'God said to Abraham, Let it not 
be grievous in thy sight because of the son, and because of the bond-woman?' " I 
inquired. And Trypho said, "Certainly; but you have not proved from this that 
there is another God besides Him who appeared to Abraham, and who also appeared 
to the other patriarchs and prophets. You have proved, however, that we were 
wrong in believing that the three who were in the tent with Abraham were all 
angels." 
I replied again, "If I could not have proved to you from the Scriptures that 
one of those three is God, and is called Angel, because, as I already said, He 
brings messages to those to whom God the Maker of all things wishes[messages to 
be brought], then in regard to Him who appeared to Abraham on earth in human 
form in like manner as the two angels who came with Him, and who was God even 
before the creation of the world, it were reasonable for you to entertain the 
same belief as is entertained by the whole of your nation." 
"Assuredly," he said, "for up to this moment this has been our belief." 
Then I replied, "Reverting to the Scriptures, I shall endeavour to persuade 
you, that He who is said to have appeared to Abraham, and to Jacob, and to 
Moses, and who is called God, is distinct from Him who made all 
things,--numerically, I mean, not[distinct] in will. For I affirm that He has 
never at any time done anything which He who made the world--above whom there is 
no other God--has not wished Him both to do and to engage Himself with." 
And Trypho said, "Prove now that this is the case, that we also may agree 
with you. For we do not understand you to affirm that He has done or said 
anything contrary to the will of the Maker of all things." 
Then I said, "The Scripture just quoted by me will make this plain to you. It 
is thus: 'The sun was risen on the earth, and Lot entered into Segor(Zoar); and 
the Lord rained on Sodom sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heaven, and 
overthrew these cities and all the neighbourhood.' " 
Then the fourth of those who had remained with Trypho said, "It must 
therefore necessarily be said that one of the two angels who went to Sodom, and 
is named by Moses in the Scripture Lord, is different from Him who also is God 
and appeared to Abraham." 
"It is not on this ground solely," I said, "that it must be admitted 
absolutely that some other one is called Lord by the Holy Spirit besides Him who 
is considered Maker of all things; not solely[for what is said] by Moses, but 
also[for what is said] by David. For there is written by him: 'The Lord says to 
my Lord, Sit on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool,' as I 
have already quoted. And again, in other words: 'Thy throne, O God, is for ever 
and ever. A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of Thy kingdom: Thou hast loved 
righteousness and hated iniquity: therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed 
Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.' If, therefore, you assert that 
the Holy Spirit calls some other one God and Lord, besides the Father of all 
things and His Christ, answer me; for I undertake to prove to you from 
Scriptures themselves, that He whom the Scripture calls Lord is not one of the 
two angels that went to Sodom, but He who was with them, and is called God, that 
appeared to Abraham." 
And Trypho said, "Prove this; for, as you see, the day advances, and we are 
not prepared for such perilous replies; since never yet have we heard any man 
investigating, or searching into, or proving these matters; nor would we have 
tolerated your conversation, had you not referred everything to the Scriptures: 
for you are very zealous in adducing proofs from them; and you are of opinion 
that there is no God above the Maker of all things." 
Then I replied, "You are aware, then, that the Scripture says, 'And the Lord 
said to Abraham, Why did Sarah hugh, saying, Shall I truly conceive? for I am 
old. Is anything impossible with God? At the time appointed shall I return to 
thee according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.' And after a 
little interval: 'And the men rose up from thence, and looked towards Sodom and 
Gomorrah; and Abraham went with them, to bring them on the way. And the Lord 
said, I will not conceal from Abraham, my servant, what I do.' And again, after 
a little, it thus says: 'The Lord said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, 
and their sins are very grievous. I will go down now, and see whether they have 
done altogether according to their cry which has come unto me; and if not, that 
I may know. And the men turned away thence, and went to Sodom. But Abraham was 
standing before the Lord; and Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt Thou destroy the 
righteous with the wicked?' "(and so on, for I do not think fit to write over 
again the same words, having written them all before, but shall of necessity 
give those by which I established the proof to Trypho and his companions. Then I 
proceeded to what follows, in which these words are recorded:) " 'And the Lord 
went His way as soon as He had left communing with Abraham; and[Abraham] went to 
his place. And there came two angels to Sodom at even. And Lot sat in the gate 
of Sodom;' and what follows until, 'But the men put forth their hands, and 
pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door of the house;' and what 
follows till, 'And the angels laid hold on his hand, and on the hand of his 
wife, and on the hands of his daughters, the Lord being merciful to him. And it 
came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that they said, Save, 
save thy life. Look not behind thee, nor stay in all the neighbourhood; escape 
to the mountain, lest thou be taken along with[them]. And Lot said to them, I 
beseech[Thee], O Lord, since Thy servant bath found grace in Thy sight, and Thou 
hast magnified Thy righteousness, which Thou showest towards me in saving my 
life; but I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die. 
Behold, this city is near to flee unto, and it is small: there I shall be safe, 
since it is small; and any soul shall live. And He said to him, Behold, I have 
accepted thee also in this matter, so as not to destroy the city for which thou 
hast spoken. Make haste to save thyself there; for I shall not do anything till 
thou be come thither. Therefore he called the name of the city Segor(Zoar). The 
sun was risen upon the earth; and Lot entered into Segor(Zoar). And the Lord 
rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heaven; and 
He overthrew these cities, and all the neighbourhood.'" And after another pause 
I added: "And now have you not perceived, my friends, that one of the three, who 
is both God and Lord, and ministers to Him who is in the heavens, is Lord of the 
two angels? For when[the angels] proceeded to Sodom, He remained behind, and 
communed with Abraham in the words recorded by Moses; and when He departed after 
the conversation, Abraham went back to his place. And when he came[to Sodom], 
the two angels no longer conversed with Lot, but Himself, as the Scripture makes 
evident; and He is the Lord who received commission from the Lord who[remains] 
in the heavens, i.e.,the Maker of all things, to inflict upon Sodom and Gomorrah 
the[judgments] which the Scripture describes in these terms:'The Lord rained 
down upon Sodom and Gomorrah sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heaven.' " 
CHAPTER LVII -- THE JEW OBJECTS, WHY IS HE SAID TO HAVE EATEN, IF HE BE GOD? 
ANSWER OF JUSTIN. 
Then Trypho said when I was silent, "That Scripture compels us to admit this, 
is manifest; but there is a matter about which we are deservedly at a 
loss--namely, about what was said to the effect that[the Lord] ate what was 
prepared and placed before him by Abraham; and you would admit this." 
I answered, "It is written that they ate; and if we believe that it is said 
the three ate, and not the two alone--who were really angels, and are nourished 
in the heavens, as is evident to us, even though they are not nourished by food 
similar to that which mortals use--(for, concerning the sustenance of manna 
which supported your fathers in the desert, Scripture speaks thus, that they ate 
angels'food):[if we believe that three ate], then I would say that the Scripture 
which affirms they ate bears the same meaning as when we would say about fire 
that it has devoured all things; yet it is not certainly understood that they 
ate, masticating with teeth and jaws. So that not even here should we be at a 
loss about anything, if we are acquainted even slightly with figurative modes of 
expression, and able to rise above them." 
And Trypho said, "It is possible that[the question] about the mode of eating 
may be thus explained:[the mode, that is to say,] in which it is written, they 
took and ate what had been prepared by Abraham: so that you may now proceed to 
explain to us how this God who appeared to Abraham, and is minister to God the 
Maker of all things, being born of the Virgin, became man, of like passions with 
all, as you said previously." 
Then I replied, "Permit me first, Trypho, to collect some other proofs on 
this head, so that you, by the large number of them, may be persuaded of[the 
truth of] it, and thereafter I shall explain what you ask." 
And he said, "Do as seems good to you; for I shall be thoroughly pleased." 
CHAPTER LVIII -- THE SAME IS PROVED FROM THE VISIONS WHICH APPEARED TO JACOB. 

Then I continued, "I purpose to quote to you Scriptures, not that I am 
anxious to make merely an artful display of words; for I possess no such 
faculty, but God's grace alone has been granted to me to the understanding of 
His Scriptures, of which grace I exhort all to become partakers freely and 
bounteously, in order that they may not, through want of it, incur condemnation 
in the judgment which God the Maker of all things shall hold through my Lord 
Jesus Christ." 
And Trypho said, "What you do is worthy of the worship of God; but you appear 
to me to feign ignorance when you say that you do not possess a store of artful 
words." 
I again replied, "Be it so, since you think so; yet I am persuaded that I 
speak the truth. But give me your attention, that I may now rather adduce the 
remaining proofs." 
"Proceed," said he. 
And I continued: "It is again written by Moses, my brethren, that He who is 
called God and appeared to the patriarchs is called both Angel and Lord, in 
order that from this you may understand Him to be minister to the Father of all 
things, as you have already admitted, and may remain firm, persuaded by 
additional arguments. The word of God, therefore,[recorded] by Moses, when 
referring to Jacob the grandson of Abraham, speaks thus: 'And it came to pass, 
when the sheep conceived, that I saw them with my eyes in the dream: And, 
behold, the he-goats and the rams which leaped upon the sheep and she-goats were 
spotted with white, and speckled and sprinkled with a dun colour. And the Angel 
of God said to me in the dream, Jacob, Jacob. And I said, What is it, Lord? And 
He said, Lift up thine eyes, and see that the he-goats and rams leaping on the 
sheep and she-goats are spotted with white, speckled, and sprinkled with a dun 
colour. For I have seen what Laban doeth unto thee. I am the God who appeared to 
thee in Bethel, where thou anointedst a pillar and vowedst a vow unto Me. Now 
therefore arise, and get thee out of this land, and depart to the land of thy 
birth, and I shall be with thee. And again, in other words, speaking of the same 
Jacob, it thus says: 'And having risen up that night, he took the two wives, and 
the two women-servants, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford 
Jabbok; and he took them and went over the brook, and sent over all his 
belongings. But Jacob was left behind alone, and an Angel wrestled with him 
until morning. And He saw that He is not prevailing against him, and He touched 
the broad part of his thigh; and the broad part of Jacob's thigh grew stiff 
while he wrestled with Him. And He said, Let Me go, for the day breaketh. But he 
said, I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me. And He said to him, What is 
thy name? And he said, Jacob. And He said, Thy name shall be called no more 
Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; for thou hast prevailed with God, and with 
men shalt be powerful. And Jacob asked Him, and said, Tell me Thy name. But he 
said, Why dost thou ask after My name? And He blessed him there. And Jacob 
called the name of that place Peniel, for I saw God face to face, and my soul 
rejoiced.' And again, in other terms, referring to the same Jacob, it says the 
following: 'And Jacob came to Luz, in the land of Canaan, which is Bethel, he 
and all the people that were with him. And there he built an altar, and called 
the name of that place Bethel; for there God appeared to him when he fled from 
the face of his brother Esau. And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and was buried 
beneath Bethel under an oak: and Jacob called the name of it The Oak of Sorrow. 
And God appeared again to Jacob in Luz, when he came out from Mesopotamia in 
Syria, and He blessed him. And God said to him, Thy name shall be no more called 
Jacob, but Israel shall he thy name.' He is called God, and He is and shall be 
God." And when all had agreed on these grounds, I continued: "Moreover, I 
consider it necessary to repeat to you the words which narrate how He who is 
both Angel and God and Lord, and who appeared as a man to Abraham, and who 
wrestled in human form with Jacob, was seen by him when he fled from his brother 
Esau. They are as follows: 'And Jacob went out from the well of the oath, and 
went toward Charran. And he lighted on a spot, and slept there, for the sun was 
set; and he gathered of the stones of the place, and put them under his head. 
And he slept in that place; and he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder was set up on 
the earth, whose top reached to heaven; and the angels of God ascended and 
descended upon it. And the Lord stood above it, and He said, I am the Lord, the 
God of Abraham thy father, and of Isaac; be not afraid: the land whereon thou 
liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the 
dust of the earth, and shall be extended to the west, and south, and north, and 
east: and in thee, and in thy seed, shall all families of the earth be blessed. 
And, behold, I am with thee, keeping thee in every way wherein thou goest, and 
will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have 
done all that I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and 
said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not. And he was afraid, 
and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other than the house of God, 
and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up in the morning, and took the 
stone which he had placed under his head, and he set it up for a pillar, and 
poured oil upon the top of it; and Jacob called the name of the place The House 
of God, and the name of the city formerly was Ulammaus.'" 
CHAPTER LIX -- GOD DISTINCT FROM THE FATHER CONVERSED WITH MOSES. 
When I had spoken these words, I continued: "Permit me, further, to show you 
from the book of Exodus how this same One, who is both Angel, and God, and Lord, 
and man, and who appeared in human form to Abraham and Isaac, appeared in a 
flame of fire from the bush, and conversed with Moses." And after they said they 
would listen cheerfully, patiently, and eagerly, I went on: "These words are in 
the book which bears the title of Exodus: 'And after many days the king of Egypt 
died, and the children of Israel groaned by reason of the works;' and so on 
until,'Go and gather the elders of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them, The 
Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of 
Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying, I am surely beholding you, and the things 
which have befallen you in Egypt.'" In addition to these words, I went on: "Have 
you perceived, sirs, that this very God whom Moses speaks of as an Angel that 
talked to him in the flame of fire, declares to Moses that He is the God of 
Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob?" 
CHAPTER LX -- OPINIONS OF THE JEWS WITH REGARD TO HIM WHO APPEARED IN THE 
BUSH. 
Then Trypho said, "We do not perceive this from the passage quoted by you, 
but[only this], that it was an angel who appeared in the flame of fire, but God 
who conversed with Moses; so that there were really two persons in company with 
each other, an angel and God, that appeared in that vision." 
I again replied, "Even if this were so, my friends, that an angel and God 
were together in the vision seen by Moses, yet, as has already been proved to 
you by the passages previously quoted, it will not be the Creator of all things 
that is the God that said to Moses that He was the God of Abraham, and the God 
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, but it will be He who has been proved to you to 
have appeared to Abraham, ministering to the will of the Maker of all things, 
and likewise carrying into execution His counsel in the judgment of Sodom; so 
that, even though it be as you say, that there were two--an angel and God--he 
who has but the smallest intelligence will not venture to assert that the Maker 
and Father of all things, having left all supercelestial matters, was visible on 
a little portion of the earth." 
And Trypho said, "Since it has been previously proved that He who is called 
God and Lord, and appeared to Abraham, received from the Lord, who is in the 
heavens, that which He inflicted on the land of Sodom, even although an angel 
had accompanied the God who appeared to Moses, we shall perceive that the God 
who communed with Moses from the bush was not the Maker of all things, but He 
who has been shown to have manifested Himself to Abraham and to Isaac and to 
Jacob; who also is called and is perceived to be the Angel of God the Maker of 
all things, because He publishes to men the commands of the Father and Maker of 
all things." 
And I replied, "Now assuredly, Trypho, I shall show that, in the vision of 
Moses, this same One alone who is called an Angel, and who is God, appeared to 
and communed with Moses. For the Scripture says thus:'The Angel of the Lord 
appeared to him in a flame of fire from the bush; and he sees that the bush bums 
with fire, but the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will turn aside and 
see this great sight, for the bush is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he 
is turning aside to behold, the Lord called to him out of the bush.' In the same 
manner, therefore, in which the Scripture calls Him who appeared to Jacob in the 
dream an Angel, then[says] that the same Angel who appeared in the dream spoke 
to him, saying,'I am the God that appeared to thee when thou didst flee from the 
face of Esau thy brother;'and[again] says that, in the judgment which befell 
Sodom in the days of Abraham, the Lord had inflicted the punishment of the Lord 
who[dwells] in the heavens;--even so here, the Scripture, in announcing that the 
Angel of the Lord appeared to Moses, and in afterwards declaring him to be Lord 
and God, speaks of the same One, whom it declares by the many testimonies 
already quoted to be minister to God, who is above the world, above whom there 
is no other[God]. 
CHAPTER LXI--WISDOM IS BEGOTTEN OF THE FATHER, AS FIRE FROM FIRE. 
"I shall give you another testimony, my friends," said I, "from the 
Scriptures, that God begat before all creatures a Beginning,[who was] a certain 
rational power[proceeding] from Himself, who is called by the Holy Spirit, now 
the Glory of the Lord, now the Son, again Wisdom, again an Angel, then God, and 
then Lord and Logos; and on another occasion He calls Himself Captain, when He 
appeared in human form to Joshua the son of Nave(Nun). For He can be called by 
all those names, since He ministers to the Father's will, and since He was 
begotten of the Father by an act of will; just as we see happening among 
ourselves: for when we give out some word, we beget the word; yet not by 
abscission, so as to lessen the word[which remains] in us, when we give it out: 
and just as we see also happening in the case of a fire, which is not lessened 
when it has kindled[another], but remains the same; and that which has been 
kindled by it likewise appears to exist by itself, not diminishing that from 
which it was kindled. The Word of Wisdom, who is Himself this God begotten of 
the Father of all things, and Word, and Wisdom, and Power, and the Glory of the 
Begetter, will bear evidence to me, when He speaks by Solomon the following: 'If 
I shall declare to you what happens daily, I shall call to mind events from 
everlasting, and review them. The Lord made me the beginning of His ways for His 
works. From everlasting He established me in the beginning, before He had made 
the earth, and before He had made the deeps, before the springs of the waters 
had issued forth, before the mountains had been established. Before all the 
hills He begets me. God made the country, and the desert, and the highest 
inhabited places under the sky. When He made ready the heavens, I was along with 
Him, and when He set up His throne on the winds: when He made the high clouds 
strong, and the springs of the deep safe, when He made the foundations of the 
earth, I was with Him arranging. I was that in which He rejoiced; daily and at 
all times I delighted in His countenance, because He delighted in the finishing 
of the habitable world, and delighted in the sons of men. Now, therefore, O son, 
hear me. Blessed is the man who shall listen to me, and the mortal who shall 
keep my ways, watching daily at my doors, observing the posts of my ingoings. 
For my outgoings are the outgoings of life, and will has been prepared by the 
Lord. But they who sin against me, trespass against their own souls; and they 
who hate me love death.' 
CHAPTER LXII -- THE WORDS "LET US MAKE MAN" AGREE WITH THE TESTIMONY OF 
PROVERBS. 
"And the same sentiment was expressed, my friends, by the word of 
God[written] by Moses, when it indicated to us, with regard to Him whom it has 
pointed out, that God speaks in the creation of man with the very same design, 
in the following words:'Let Us make man after our image and likeness. And let 
them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, 
and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creeping things 
that creep on the earth. And God created man: after the image of God did He 
create him; male and female created He them. And God blessed them, and said, 
Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and have power over it. And that you 
may not change the[force of the] words just quoted, and repeat what your 
teachers assert,--either that God said to Himself,'Let Us make,'just as we, when 
about to do something, oftentimes say to ourselves,'Let us make;'or that God 
spoke to the elements, to wit, the earth and other similar substances of which 
we believe man was formed,'Let Us make,'--I shall quote again the words narrated 
by Moses himself, from which we can indisputably learn that[God] conversed with 
some one who was numerically distinct from Himself, and also a rational Being. 
These are the words:'And God said, Behold, Adam has become as one of us, to know 
good and evil.' In saying, therefore,'as one of us,'[Moses] has declared 
that[there is a certain] number of persons associated with one another, and that 
they are at least two. For I would not say that the dogma of that heresy which 
is said to be among you is true, or that the teachers of it can prove that[God] 
spoke to angels, or that the human frame was the workmanship of angels. But this 
Offspring, which was truly brought forth from the Father, was with the Father 
before all the creatures, and the Father communed with Him; even as the 
Scripture by Solomon has made clear, that He whom Solomon calls Wisdom, was 
begotten as a Beginning before all His creatures and as Offspring by God, who 
has also declared this same thing in the revelation made by Joshua the son of 
Nave(Nun). Listen, therefore, to the following from the book of Joshua, that 
what I say may become manifest to you; it is this: 'And it came to pass, when 
Joshua was near Jericho, he lifted up his eyes, and sees a man standing over 
against him. And Joshua approached to Him, and said, Art thou for us, or for our 
adversaries? And He said to him, I am Captain of the Lord's host: now have I 
come. And Joshua fell on his face on the ground, and said to Him, Lord, what 
commandest Thou Thy servant? And the Lord's Captain says to Joshua, Loose the 
shoes off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. And 
Jericho was shut up and fortified, and no one went out of it. And the Lord said 
to Joshua, Behold, I give into thine hand Jericho, and its king,[and] its mighty 
men.'" 
CHAPTER LXIII -- IT IS PROVED THAT THIS GOD WAS INCARNATE. 
And Trypho said, "This point has been proved to me forcibly, and by many 
arguments, my friend. It remains, then, to prove that He submitted to become man 
by the Virgin, according to the will of His Father; and to be crucified, and to 
die. Prove also clearly, that after this He rose again and ascended to heaven." 
I answered, "This, too, has been already de- monstrated by me in the previously 
quoted words of the prophecies, my friends; which, by recalling and expounding 
for your sakes, I shall endover to lead you to agree with me also about this 
matter. The passage, then, which Isaiah records,'Who shall declare His 
generation? for His life is taken away from the earth,--does it not appear to 
you to refer to One who, not having descent from men, was said to be delivered 
over to death by God for the transgressions of the people?--of whose blood, 
Moses(as I mentioned before), when speaking in parable, said, that He would wash 
His garments in the blood of the grape; since His blood did not spring from the 
seed of man, but from the will of God. And then, what is said by David,'In the 
splendours of Thy holiness have I begotten Thee from the womb, before the 
morning star. The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for 
ever, after the order of Melchizedek,'--does this not declare to you that[He 
was] from of old, and that the God and Father of all things intended Him to be 
begotten by a human womb? And speaking in other words, which also have been 
already quoted,[he says]:'Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of 
rectitude is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hast 
hated iniquity: therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of 
gladness above Thy fellows.[He hath anointed Thee] with myrrh, and oil, and 
cassia from Thy garments, from the ivory palaces, whereby they made Thee glad. 
Kings' daughters are in Thy honour. The queen stood at Thy right hand, clad in 
garments embroidered with gold. Hearken, O daughter, and behold, and incline 
thine ear, and forget thy people and the house of thy father; and the King shall 
desire thy beauty: because he is thy Lord, and thou shalt worship Him.' 
Therefore these words testify explicitly that He is witnessed to by Him who 
established these things, as deserving to be worshipped, as God and as Christ. 
Moreover, that the word of God speaks to those who believe in Him as being one 
soul, and one synagogue, and one church, as to a daughter; that it thus 
addresses the church which has sprung from His name and partakes of His name(for 
we are all called Christians), is distinctly proclaimed in like manner in the 
following words, which teach us also to forget[our] old ancestral customs, when 
they speak thus:'Hearken, O daughter, and behold, and incline thine ear; forget 
thy people and the house of thy father, and the King shall desire thy beauty: 
because He is thy Lord, and thou shalt worship Him.'" 
CHAPTER LXIV -- JUSTIN ADDUCES OTHER PROOFS TO THE JEW, WHO DENIES THAT HE 
NEEDS THIS CHRIST. 
Here Trypho said, "Let Him be recognised as Lord and Christ and God, as the 
Scriptures declare, by you of the Gentiles, who have from His name been all 
called Christians; but we who are servants of God that made this same[Christ], 
do not require to confess or worship Him." 
To this I replied, "If I were to be quarrelsome and light-minded like you, 
Trypho, I would no longer continue to converse with you, since you are prepared 
not to understand what has been said, but only to return some captious answer; 
but now, since I fear the judgment of God, I do not state an untimely opinion 
concerning any one of your nation, as to whether or not some of them may be 
saved by the grace of the Lord of Sabaoth. Therefore, although you act 
wrongfully, I shall continue to reply to any proposition you shall bring 
forward, and to any contradiction which you make; and, in fact, I do the very 
same to all men of every nation, who wish to examine along with me, or make 
inquiry at me, regarding this subject. Accordingly, if you had bestowed 
attention on the Scriptures previously quoted by me, you would already have 
understood, that those who are saved of your own nation are saved through 
this[man], and partake of His lot; and you would not certainly have asked me 
about this matter. I shall again repeat the words of David previously quoted by 
me, and beg of you to comprehend them, and not to act wrongfully, and stir each 
other up to give merely some contradiction. The words which David speaks, then, 
are these:'The Lord has reigned; let the nations be angry:[it is] He who sits 
upon the cherubim; let the earth be shaken. The Lord is great in Zion; and He is 
high above all the nations. Let them confess Thy great name, for it is fearful 
and holy; and the honour of the king loves judgment. Thou hast prepared equity; 
judgment and righteousness hast Thou performed in Jacob. Exalt the Lord our God, 
and worship the footstool of His feet; for He is holy. Moses and Aaron among His 
priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name; they called on the Lord, 
and He heard them. In the pillar of the cloud He spake to them; for they kept 
His testimonies and His commandments which He gave them.' And from the other 
words of David, also previously quoted, which you foolishly affirm refer to 
Solomon,[because] inscribed for Solomon, it can be proved that they do not refer 
to Solomon, and that this[Christ] existed before the sun, and that those of your 
nation who are saved shall be saved through Him.[The words] are these:'O God, 
give Thy judgment to the king, and Thy righteousness unto the king's son. He 
shall judge Thy people with righteousness, and Thy poor with judgment. The 
mountains shall take up peace to the people, and the little hills righteousness. 
He shall judge the poor of the people, and shall save the children of the needy, 
and shall abase the slanderer: and He shall co-endure with the sun, and before 
the moon unto all generations;'and so on until, 'His name endureth before the 
sun, and all tribes of the earth shall be blessed in Him. All nations shall call 
Him blessed. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous 
things: and blessed be His glorious name for ever and ever: and the whole earth 
shall be filled with His glory. Amen, Amen.' And you remember from other words 
also spoken by David, and which I have mentioned before, how it is declared that 
He would come forth from the highest heavens, and again return to the same 
places, in order that you may recognise Him as God coming forth from above, and 
man living among men; and[how it is declared] that He will again appear, and 
they who pierced Him shall see Him, and shall bewail Him.[The words] are these: 
'The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork. 
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge: They are 
not speeches or words whose voices are heard. Their sound has gone out through 
all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. In the sun has he set 
his habitation; and he, like a bridegroom going forth from his chamber, will 
rejoice as a giant to run his race: from the highest heaven is his going forth, 
and he returns to the highest heaven, and there is not one who shall be hidden 
from his heat.' " 
CHAPTER LXV -- THE JEW OBJECTS THAT GOD DOES NOT GIVE HIS GLORY TO ANOTHER. 
JUSTIN EXPLAINS THE PASSAGE. 
And Trypho said, "Being shaken by so many Scriptures, I know not what to say 
about the Scripture which Isaiah writes, in which God says that He gives not His 
glory to another, speaking thus 'I am the Lord God; this is my name; my glory 
will I not give to another, nor my virtues.'" 
And I answered, "If you spoke these words, Trypho, and then kept silence in 
simplicity and with no ill intent, neither repeating what goes before nor adding 
what comes after, you must be forgiven; but if[you have done so] because you 
imagined that you could throw doubt on the passage, in order that I might say 
the Scriptures contradicted each other, you have erred. But I shall not venture 
to suppose or to say such a thing; and if a Scripture which appears to be of 
such a kind be brought forward, and if there be a pretext[for saying] that it is 
contrary[to some other], since I am entirely convinced that no Scripture 
contradicts another, I shall admit rather that I do not understand what is 
recorded, and shall strive to persuade those who imagine that the Scriptures are 
contradictory, to be rather of the same opinion as myself. With what intent, 
then, you have brought forward the difficulty, God knows. But I shall remind you 
of what the passage says, in order that you may recognise even from this 
very[place] that God gives glory to His Christ alone. And I shall take up some 
short passages, sirs, those which are in connection with what has been said by 
Trypho, and those which are also joined on in consecutive order. For I will not 
repeat those of another section, but those which are joined together in one. Do 
you also give me your attention.[The words] are these:'Thus saith the Lord, the 
God that created the heavens, and made them fast, that established the earth, 
and that which is in it; and gave breath to the people upon it, and spirit to 
them who walk therein: I the Lord God have called Thee in righteousness, and 
will hold Thine hand, and will strengthen Thee; and I have given Thee for a 
covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the 
blind, to bring out them that are bound from the chains, and those who sit in 
darkness from the prison-house. I am the Lord God; this is my name: my glory 
will I not give to another, nor my virtues to graven images. Behold, the former 
things are come to pass; new things which I announce, and before they are 
announced they are made manifest to you. Sing unto the Lord a new song: His 
sovereignty from the end of the earth.[Sing], ye who descend into the sea, and 
continually sail[on it]; ye islands, and inhabitants thereof. Rejoice, O 
wilderness, and the villages thereof, and the houses; and the inhabitants of 
Cedar shall rejoice, and the inhabitants of the rock shall cry aloud from the 
top of the mountains: they shall give glory to God; they shall publish His 
virtues among the islands. The Lord God of hosts shall go forth, He shall 
destroy war utterly, He shall stir up zeal, and He shall cry aloud to the 
enemies with strength.' " And when I repeated this, I said to them, "Have you 
perceived, my friends, that God says He will give Him whom He has established as 
a light of the Gentiles, glory, and to no other; and not, as Trypho said, that 
God was retaining the glory to Himself?" 
Then Trypho answered, "We have perceived this also; pass on therefore to the 
remainder of the discourse." 
CHAPTER LXVI -- HE PROVES FROM ISAIAH THAT GOD WAS BORN FROM A VIRGIN. 
And I, resuming the discourse where I had left off at a previous stage, when 
proving that He was born of a virgin, and that His birth of a virgin had been 
predicted by Isaiah, quoted again the same prophecy. It is as follows 'And the 
Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying, Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God, 
in the depth or in the height. And Ahaz said I will not ask, neither will I 
tempt the Lord. And Isaiah said, Hear then, O house of David; Is it no small 
thing for you to contend with men? And how do you contend with the Lord? 
Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign; Behold, the virgin shall 
conceive, and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel. Butter 
and honey shall he eat; before he knows or prefers the evil he will choose out 
the good. For before the child knows ill or good, he rejects evil by choosing 
out the good. For before the child knows how to call father or mother, he shall 
receive the power of Damascus, and the spoil of Samaria, in presence of the king 
of Assyria. And the land shall be forsaken, which thou shalt with difficulty 
endure in consequence of the presence of its two kings. But God shall bring on 
thee, and on thy people, and on the house of thy father, days which have not yet 
come upon thee since the day in which Ephraim took away from Judah the king of 
Assyria.' " And I continued: "Now it is evident to all, that in the race of 
Abraham according to the flesh no one has been born of a virgin, or is said to 
have been born[of a virgin], save this our Christ." 
CHAPTER LXVII -- TRYPHO COMPARES JESUS WITH PERSEUS; AND WOULD PREFER[TO SAY] 
THAT HE WAS ELECTED[TO BE CHRIST] ON ACCOUNT OF OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW. JUSTIN 
SPEAKS OF THE LAW AS FORMERLY. 
And Trypho answered, "The Scripture has not, 'Behold, the virgin shall 
conceive, and bear a son,' but, 'Behold, the young woman shall conceive, and 
bear a son,' and so on, as you quoted. But the whole prophecy refers to 
Hezekiah, and it is proved that it was fulfilled in him, according to the terms 
of this prophecy. Moreover, in the fables of those who are called Greeks, it is 
written that Perseus was begotten of Danae, who was a virgin; he who was called 
among them Zeus having descended on her in the form of a golden shower. And you 
ought to feel ashamed when you make assertions similar to theirs, and 
rather[should] say that this Jesus was born man of men. And if you prove from 
the Scriptures that He is the Christ, and that on account of having led a life 
conformed to the law, and perfect, He deserved the honour of being elected to be 
Christ,[it is well]; but do not venture to tell monstrous phenomena, lest you be 
convicted of talking foolishly like the Greeks." 
Then I said to this, "Trypho, I wish to persuade you, and all men in short, 
of this, that even though you talk worse things in ridicule and in jest, you 
will not move me from my fixed design; but I shall always adduce from the words 
which you think can be brought forward[by you] as proof[of your own views], the 
demonstration of what I have stated along with the testimony of the Scriptures. 
You are not, however, acting fairly or truthfully in attempting to undo those 
things in which there has been constantly agreement between us; namely, that 
certain commands were instituted by Moses on account of the hardness of your 
people's hearts. For you said that, by reason of His living conformably to law, 
He was elected and became Christ, if indeed He were proved to be so." 
And Trypho said, "You admitted to us that He was both circumcised, and 
observed the other legal ceremonies ordained by Moses." 
And I replied, "I have admitted it, and do admit it: yet I have admitted that 
He endured all these not as if He were justified by them, but completing the 
dispensation which His Father, the Maker of all things, and Lord and God, wished 
Him[to complete]. For I admit that He endured crucifixion and death, and the 
incarnation, and the suffering of as many afflictions as your nation put upon 
Him. But since again you dissent from that to which you but lately assented, 
Trypho, answer me: Are those righteous patriarchs who lived before Moses, who 
observed none of those[ordinances] which, the Scripture shows, received the 
commencement of[their] institution from Moses, saved,[and have they attained to] 
the inheritance of the blessed?" 
And Trypho said, "The Scriptures compel me to admit it." 
"Likewise I again ask you," said I, "did God enjoin your fathers to present 
the offerings and sacrifices because He had need of them, or because of the 
hardness of their hearts and tendency to idolatry?" 
"The latter," said he, "the Scriptures in like manner compel us to admit." 
"Likewise," said I, "did not the Scriptures predict that God promised to 
dispense a new covenant besides that which[was dispensed] in the mountain 
Horeb?" 
This, too, he replied, had been predicted. 
Then I said again, "Was not the old covenant laid on your fathers with fear 
and trembling, so that they could not give ear to God?" 
He admitted it. 
"What then?" said I: "God promised that there would be another covenant, not 
like that old one, and said that it would be laid on them without fear, and 
trembling, and lightnings, and that it would be such as to show what kind of 
commands and deeds God knows to be eternal and suited to every nation, and what 
commandments He has given, suiting them to the hardness of your people's hearts, 
as He exclaims also by the prophets." 
"To this also," said he, "those who are lovers of truth and not lovers of 
strife must assuredly assent." 
Then I replied, "I know not how you speak of persons very fond of 
strife,[since] you yourself oftentimes were plainly acting in this very manner, 
frequently contradicting what you had agreed to." 
CHAPTER LXVIII -- HE COMPLAINS OF THE OBSTINACY OF TRYPHO; HE ANSWERS HIS 
OBJECTION; HE CONVICTS THE JEWS OF BAD FAITH. 
And Trypho said, "You endeavour to prove an incredible and well-nigh 
impossible thing;[namely], that God endured to be born and become man." 
"If I undertook," said I, "to prove this by doctrines or arguments of man, 
you should not bear with me. But if I quote frequently Scriptures, and so many 
of them, referring to this point, and ask you to comprehend them, you are 
hard-hearted in the recognition of the mind and will of God. But if you wish to 
remain for ever so, I would not be injured at all; and for ever retaining the 
same[opinions] which I had before I met with you, I shall leave you." 
And Trypho said," Look, my friend, you made yourself master of these[truths] 
with much labour and toil. And we accordingly must diligently scrutinize all 
that we meet with, in order to give our assent to those things which the 
Scriptures compel us[to believe]." 
Then I said to this, "I do not ask you not to strive earnestly by all means, 
in making an investigation of the matters inquired into; but[I ask you], when 
you have nothing to say, not to contradict those things which you said you had 
admitted." 
And Trypho said, "So we shall endeavour to do." 
I continued again: "In addition to the questions I have just now put to you, 
I wish to put more: for by means of these questions I shall strive to bring the 
discourse to a speedy termination." 
And Trypho said, "Ask the questions." 
Then I said, "Do you think that any other one is said to be worthy of worship 
and called Lord and God in the Scriptures, except the Maker of all, and Christ, 
who by so many Scriptures was proved to you to have become man?" 
And Trypho replied, "How can we admit this, when we have instituted so great 
an inquiry as to whether there is any other than the Father alone?" 
Then I again said, "I must ask you this also, that I may know whether or not 
you are of a different opinion from that which you admitted some time ago." 
He replied, "It is not, sir." 
Then again I, "Since you certainly admit these things, and since Scripture 
says, 'Who shall declare His generation?' ought you not now to suppose that He 
is not the seed of a human race?" 
And Trypho said, "How then does the Word say to David, that out of his loins 
God shall take to Himself a Son, and shall establish His kingdom, and shall set 
Him on the throne of His glory?" 
And I said, "Trypho, if the prophecy which Isaiah uttered, "Behold, the 
virgin shall conceive,' is said not to the house of David, but to another house 
of the twelve tribes, perhaps the matter would have some difficulty; but since 
this prophecy refers to the house of David, Isaiah has explained how that which 
was spoken by God to David in mystery would take place. But perhaps you are not 
aware of this, my friends, that there were many sayings written obscurely, or 
parabolically, or mysteriously, and symbolical actions, which the prophets who 
lived after the persons who said or did them expounded." "Assuredly," said 
Trypho. 
"If therefore, I shall show that this prophecy of Isaiah refers to our 
Christ, and not to Hezekiah, as you say, shall I not in this matter, too, 
compel you not to believe your teachers, who venture to assert that the 
explanation which your seventy elders that were with Ptolemy the king of the 
Egyptians gave, is untrue in certain respects? For some statements in the 
Scriptures, which appear explicitly to convict them of a foolish and vain 
opinion, these they venture to assert have not been so written. But other 
statements, which they fancy they can distort and harmonize with human actions, 
these, they say, refer not to this Jesus Christ of ours, but to him of whom they 
are pleased to explain them. Thus, for instance, they have taught you that this 
Scripture which we are now discussing refers to Hezekiah, in which, as I 
promised, I shall show they are wrong. And since they are compelled, they agree 
that some Scriptures which we mention to them, and which expressly prove that 
Christ was to suffer, to be worshipped, and[to be called] God, and which I have 
already recited to you, do refer indeed to Christ, but they venture to assert 
that this man is not Christ. But they admit that He will come to suffer, and to 
reign, and to be worshipped, and to be God; and this opinion I shall in like 
manner show to be ridiculous and silly. But since I am pressed to answer first 
to what was said by you in jest, I shall make answer to it, and shall afterwards 
give replies to what follows. 
CHAPTER LXIX -- THE DEVIL, SINCE HE EMULATES THE TRUTH, HAS INVENTED FABLES 
ABOUT BACCHUS, HERCULES, AND SCULAPIUS. 
"Be well assured, then, Trypho," I continued, "that I am established in the 
knowledge of and faith in the Scriptures by those counterfeits which he who is 
called the devil is said to have performed among the Greeks; just as some were 
wrought by the Magi in Egypt, and others by the false prophets in Elijah's days. 
For when they tell that Bacchus, son of Jupiter, was begotten by[Jupiter's] 
intercourse with Semele, and that he was the discoverer of the vine; and when 
they relate, that being torn in pieces, and having died, he rose again, and 
ascended to heaven; and when they introduce wine into his mysteries, do I not 
perceive that[the devil] has imitated the prophecy announced by the patriarch 
Jacob, and recorded by Moses? And when they tell that Hercules was strong, and 
travelled over all the world, and was begotten by Jove of Alcmene, and ascended 
to heaven when he died, do I not perceive that the Scripture which speaks of 
Christ, 'strong as a giant to run his race,' has been in like manner imitated? 
And when he[the devil] brings forward sculapius as the raiser of the dead and 
healer of all diseases, may I not say that in this matter likewise he has 
imitated the prophecies about Christ? But since I have not quoted to you such 
Scripture as tells that Christ will do these things, I must necessarily remind 
you of one such: from which you can understand, how that to those destitute of a 
knowledge of God, I mean the Gentiles, who, 'having eyes, saw not, and having a 
heart, understood not,' worshipping the images of wood,[how even to them] 
Scripture prophesied that they would renounce these[vanities], and hope in this 
Christ. It is thus written: 'Rejoice, thirsty wilderness: let the wilderness be 
glad, and blossom as the lily: the deserts of the Jordan shall both blossom and 
be glad: and the glory of Lebanon was given to it, and the honour of Carmel. And 
my people shall see the exaltation of the Lord, and the glory of God. Be strong, 
ye careless hands and enfeebled knees. Be comforted, ye faint in soul: be 
strong, fear not. Behold, our God gives, and will give, retributive judgment. He 
shall come and save us. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears 
of the deaf shall hear. Then the lame shall leap as an hart, and the tongue of 
the stammerers shall be distinct: for water has broken forth in the wilderness, 
and a valley in the thirsty land; and the parched ground shall become pools, and 
a spring of water shall[rise up] in the thirsty land.' The spring of living 
water which gushed forth from God in the land destitute of the knowledge of God, 
namely the land of the Gentiles, was this Christ, who also appeared in your 
nation, and healed those who were maimed, and deaf, and lame in body from their 
birth, causing them to leap, to hear, and to see, by His word. And having raised 
the dead, and causing them to live, by His deeds He compelled the men who lived 
at that time to recognise Him. But though they saw such works, they asserted it 
was magical art. For they dared to call Him a magician, and a deceiver of the 
people. Yet He wrought such works, and persuaded those who were[destined to] 
believe on Him; for even if any one be labouring under a defect of body, yet be 
an observer of the doctrines delivered by Him, He shall raise him up at His 
second advent perfectly sound, after He has made him immortal, and 
incorruptible, and free from grief. 
CHAPTER LXX -- SO ALSO THE MYSTERIES OF MITHRAS ARE DISTORTED FROM THE 
PROPHECIES OF DANIEL AND ISAIAH. 
"And when those who record the mysteries of Mithras say that he was begotten 
of a rock, and call the place where those who believe in him are initiated a 
cave, do I not perceive here that the utterance of Daniel, that a stone without 
hands was cut out of a great mountain, has been imitated by them, and that they 
have attempted likewise to imitate the whole of Isaiah's words? For they 
contrived that the words of righteousness be quoted also by them. But I must 
repeat to you the words of Isaiah referred to, in order that from them you may 
know that these things are so. They are these: 'Hear, ye that are far off, what 
I have done; those that are near shall know my might. The sinners in Zion are 
removed; trembling shall seize the impious. Who shall announce to you the 
everlasting place? The man who walks in righteousness, speaks in the right way, 
hates sin and unrighteousness, and keeps his hands pure from bribes, stops the 
ears from hearing the unjust judgment of blood closes the eyes from seeing 
unrighteousness: he shall dwell in the lofty cave of the strong rock. Bread 
shall be given to him, and his water[shall be] sure. Ye shall see the King with 
glory, and your eyes shall look far off. Your soul shall pursue diligently the 
fear of the Lord. Where is the scribe? where are the counsellors? where is he 
that numbers those who are nourished,--the small and great people? with whom 
they did not take counsel, nor knew the depth of the voices, so that they heard 
not. The people who are become depreciated, and there is no understanding in him 
who hears.' Now it is evident, that in this prophecy[allusion is made] to the 
bread which our Christ gave us to eat, in remembrance of His being made flesh 
for the sake of His believers, for whom also He suffered; and to the cup which 
He gave us to drink, in remembrance of His own blood, with giving of thanks. And 
this prophecy proves that we shall behold this very King with glory; and the 
very terms of the prophecy declare loudly, that the people foreknown to believe 
in Him were fore-known to pursue diligently the fear of the Lord. Moreover, 
these Scriptures are equally explicit in saying, that those who are reputed to 
know the writings of the Scriptures, and who hear the prophecies, have no 
understanding. And when I hear, Trypho," said I, "that Perseus was begotten of a 
virgin, I understand that the deceiving serpent counterfeited also this. 
CHAPTER LXXI -- THE JEWS REJECT THE INTERPRETATION OF THE LXX., FROM WHICH, 
MOREOVER, THEY HAVE TAKEN AWAY SOME PASSAGES. 
"But I am far from putting reliance in your teachers, who refuse to admit 
that the interpretation made by the seventy elders who were with Ptolemy[king] 
of the Egyptians is a correct one; and they attempt to frame another. And I wish 
you to observe, that they have altogether taken away many Scriptures from the 
translations effected by those seventy elders who were with Ptolemy, and by 
which this very man who was crucified is proved to have been set forth expressly 
as God, and man, and as being crucified, and as dying; but since I am aware that 
this is denied by all of your nation, I do not address myself to these points, 
but I proceed to carry on my discussions by means of those passages which are 
still admitted by you. For you assent to those which I have brought before your 
attention, except that you contradict the statement, 'Behold, the virgin shall 
conceive,' and say it ought to be read, 'Behold, the young woman shall 
conceive.' And I promised to prove that the prophecy referred, not, as you were 
taught, to Hezekiah, but to this Christ of mine: and now I shall go to the 
proof." 
Here Trypho remarked, "We ask you first of all to tell us some of the 
Scriptures which you allege have been completely cancelled." 
CHAPTER LXXII -- PASSAGES HAVE BEEN REMOVED BY THE JEWS FROM ESDRAS AND 
JEREMIAH. 
And I said, "I shall do as you please. From the statements, then, which 
Esdras made in reference to the law of the passover, they have taken away the 
following: 'And Esdras said to the people, This passover is our Saviour and our 
refuge. And if you have understood, and your heart has taken it in, that we 
shall humble Him on a standard, and thereafter hope in Him, then this place 
shall not be forsaken for ever, says the God of hosts. But if you will not 
believe Him, and will not listen to His declaration, you shall be a 
laughing-stock to the nations.' And from the sayings of Jeremiah they have cut 
out the following: 'I[was] like a lamb that is brought to the slaughter: they 
devised a device against me, saying, Come, let us lay on wood on His bread, and 
let us blot Him out from the land of the living; and His name shall no more be 
remembered.' And since this passage from the sayings of Jeremiah is still 
written in some copies [of the Scriptures] in the synagogues of the Jews(for it 
is only a short time since they were cut out), and since from these words it is 
demonstrated that the Jews deliberated about the Christ Himself, to crucify and 
put Him to death, He Himself is both declared to be led as a sheep to the 
slaughter, as was predicted by Isaiah, and is here represented as a harmless 
lamb; but being in a difficulty about them, they give themselves over to 
blasphemy. And again, from the sayings of the same Jeremiah these have been cut 
out: 'The Lord God remembered His dead people of Israel who lay in the graves; 
and He descended to preach to them His own salvation.' 
CHAPTER LXXIII -- [THE WORDS] "FROM THE WOOD" HAVE BEEN CUT OUT OF PS. XCVI 
"And from the ninety-fifth(ninety-sixth) Psalm they have taken away this 
short saying of the words of David: 'From the wood.' For when the passage said, 
'Tell ye among the nations, the Lord hath reigned from the wood,' they have 
left, 'Tell ye among the nations, the Lord hath reigned.' Now no one of your 
people has ever been said to have reigned as God and Lord among the nations, 
with the exception of Him only who was crucified, of whom also the Holy Spirit 
affirms in the same Psalm that He was raised again, and freed from[the grave], 
declaring that there is none like Him among the gods of the nations: for they 
are idols of demons. But I shall repeat the whole Psalm to you, that you may 
perceive what has been said. It is thus: 'Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing 
unto the Lord, all the earth. Sing unto the Lord, and bless His name; show forth 
His salvation from day to day. Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders 
among all people. For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: He is to be 
feared above all the gods. For all the gods of the nations are demons but the 
Lord made the heavens. Confession and beauty are in His presence; holiness and 
magnificence are in His sanctuary. Bring to the Lord, O ye countries of the 
nations, bring to the Lord glory and honour, bring to the Lord glory in His 
name. Take sacrifices, and go into His courts; worship the Lord in His holy 
temple. Let the whole earth be moved before Him tell ye among the nations, the 
Lord hath reigned. For He hath established the world, which shall not be moved; 
He shall judge the nations with equity. Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth 
be glad; let the sea and its fulness shake. Let the fields and all therein be 
joyful. Let all the trees of the wood be glad before the Lord: for He comes, for 
He comes to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with righteousness, and 
the people with His truth.'" 
Here Trypho remarked, "Whether[or not] the rulers of the people have erased 
any portion of the Scriptures, as you affirm, God knows; but it seems 
incredible." 
"Assuredly," said I, "it does seem incredible. For it is more horrible than 
the calf which they made, when satisfied with manna on the earth; or than the 
sacrifice of children to demons; or than the slaying of the prophets. But," said 
I, "you appear to me not to have heard the Scriptures which I said they had 
stolen away. For such as have been quoted are more than enough to prove the 
points in dispute, besides those which are retained by us, and shall yet be 
brought forward." 
CHAPTER LXXIV -- THE BEGINNING OF PS. XCVI. IS ATTRIBuTED TO THE FATHER[BY 
TRYPHO]. BUT[IT REFERS] TO CHRIST BY THESE WORDS: "TELL YE AMONG THE NATIONS 
THAT THE LORD," ETC. 
Then Trypho said, "We know that you quoted these because we asked you. But it 
does not appear to me that this Psalm which you quoted last from the words of 
David refers to any other than the Father and Maker of the heavens and earth. 
You, however, asserted that it referred to Him who suffered, whom you also are 
eagerly endeavouring to prove to be Christ." 
And I answered, "Attend to me, I beseech you, while I speak of the statement 
which the Holy Spirit gave utterance to in this Psalm; and you shall know that I 
speak not sinfully, and that we are not really bewitched; for so you shall be 
enabled of yourselves to understand many other statements made by the Holy 
Spirit. 'Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth: sing 
unto the Lord, and bless His name; show forth His salvation from day to day, His 
wonderful works among all people.' He bids the inhabitants of all the earth, who 
have known the mystery of this salvation, i.e., the suffering of Christ, by 
which He saved them, sing and give praises to God the Father of all things, and 
recognise that He is to be praised and feared, and that He is the Maker of 
heaven and earth, who effected this salvation in behalf of the human race, who 
also was crucified and was dead, and who was deemed worthy by Him(God) to reign 
over all the earth. As[is clearly seen] also by the land into which[He said] He 
would bring[your fathers];[for He thus speaks]: 'This people[shall go a whoring 
after other gods], and shall forsake Me, and shall break my covenant which I 
made with them in that day; and I will forsake them, and will turn away My face 
from them; and they shall be devoured, and many evils and afflictions shall find 
them out; and they shall say in that day, Because the Lord my God is not amongst 
us, these misfortunes have found us out. And I shall certainly turn away My face 
from them in that day, on account of all the evils which they have committed, in 
that they have turned to other gods.' 
CHAPTER LXXV -- IT IS PROVED THAT JESUS WAS THE NAME OF GOD IN THE BOOK OF 
EXODUS. 
"Moreover, in the book of Exodus we have also perceived that the name of God 
Himself which, He says, was not revealed to Abraham or to Jacob, was Jesus, and 
was declared mysteriously through Moses. Thus it is written: 'And the Lord spake 
to Moses, Say to this people, Behold, I send My angel before thy face, to keep 
thee in the way, to bring thee into the land which I have prepared for thee. 
Give heed to Him, and obey Him; do not disobey Him. For He will not draw back 
from you; for My name is in Him.' Now understand that He who led your fathers 
into the land is called by this name Jesus, and first called Auses(Oshea). For 
if you shall understand this, you shall likewise perceive that the name of Him 
who said to Moses, 'for My name is in Him,' was Jesus. For, indeed, He was also 
called Israel, and Jacob's name was changed to this also. Now Isaiah shows that 
those prophets who are sent to publish tidings from God are called His angels 
and apostles. For Isaiah says in a certain place, 'Send me.' And that the 
prophet whose name was changed, Jesus[Joshua], was strong and great, is manifest 
to all. If, then, we know that God revealed Himself in so many forms to Abraham, 
and to Jacob, and to Moses, how are we at a loss, and do not believe that, 
according to the will of the Father of all things, it was possible for Him to be 
born man of the Virgin, especially after we have such Scriptures, from which it 
can be plainly perceived that He became so according to the will of the Father? 
CHAPTER LXXVI -- FROM OTHER PASSAGES THE SAME MAJESTY AND GOVERNMENT OF 
CHRIST ARE PROVED. 
"For when Daniel speaks of 'one like unto the Son of man' who received the 
everlasting kingdom, does he not hint at this very thing? For he declares that, 
in saying 'like unto the Son of man,' He appeared, and was man, but not of human 
seed. And the same thing he proclaimed in mystery when he speaks of this stone 
which was cut out without hands. For the expression 'it was cut out without 
hands' signified that it is not a work of man, but[a work] of the will of the 
Father and God of all things, who brought Him forth. And when Isaiah says, 'Who 
shall declare His generation?' he meant that His descent could not be declared. 
Now no one who is a man of men has a descent that cannot be declared. And when 
Moses says that He will wash His garments in the blood of the grape, does not 
this signify what I have now often told you is an obscure prediction, namely, 
that He had blood, but not from men; just as not man, but God, has begotten the 
blood of the vine? And when Isaiah calls Him the Angel of mighty l counsel, did 
he not foretell Him to be the Teacher of those truths which He did teach when He 
came[to earth]? For He alone taught openly those mighty counsels which the 
Father designed both for all those who have been and shall be well-pleasing to 
Him, and also for those who have rebelled against His will, whether men or 
angels, when He said: 'They shall come from the east[and from the west], and 
shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: but 
the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.' And, 'Many 
shall say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten, and drunk, and 
prophesied, and cast out demons in Thy name? And I will say to them, Depart from 
Me.' Again, in other words, by which He shall condemn those who are unworthy of 
salvation, He said, Depart into outer darkness, which the Father has prepared 
for Satan and his, angels.' And again, in other words, He said, 'I give unto you 
power to tread on serpents, and on scorpions, and on scolopendras, and on 
all the might of the enemy.' And now we, who believe on our Lord Jesus, who was 
crucified under Pontius Pilate, when we exorcise all demons and evil spirits, 
have them subjected to us. For if the prophets declared obscurely that Christ 
would suffer, and thereafter be Lord of all, yet that[declaration] could not be 
understood by any man until He Himself persuaded the apostles that such 
statements were expressly related in the Scriptures. For He exclaimed before His 
crucifixion: 'The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the 
Scribes and Pharisees, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.' And 
David predicted that He would be born from the womb before sun and moon, 
according to the Father's will, and made Him known, being Christ, as God strong 
and to be worshipped." 
CHAPTER LXXVII -- HE RETURNS TO EXPLAIN THE PROPHECY OF ISAIAH. 
Then Trypho said, "I admit that such and so great arguments are sufficient to 
persuade one; but I wish[you] to know that I ask you for the proof which you 
have frequently proposed to give me. Proceed then to make this plain to us, that 
we may see how you prove that that[passage] refers to this Christ of yours. For 
we assert that the prophecy relates to Hezekiah." And I replied, "I shall do as 
you wish. But show me yourselves first of all how it is said of Hezekiah, that 
before he knew how to call father or mother, he received the power of Damascus 
and the spoils of Samaria in the presence of the king of Assyria. For it will 
not be conceded to you, as you wish to explain it, that Hezekiah waged war with 
the inhabitants of Damascus and Samaria in presence of the king of Assyria. 'For 
before the child knows how to call father or mother,' the prophetic word said, 
'He shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria in presence of the 
king of Assyria.' For if the Spirit of prophecy had not made the statement with 
an addition, 'Before the child knows how to call father or mother, he shall take 
the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria,' but had only said, 'And shall bear 
a son, and he shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria,' then you 
might say that God foretold that he would take these things, since He fore-knew 
it. But now the prophecy has stated it with this addition: 'Before the child 
knows how to call father or mother, he shall take the power of Damascus and 
spoils of Samaria.' And you cannot prove that such a thing ever happened to any 
one among the Jews. But we are able to prove that it happened in the case of our 
Christ. For at the time of His birth, Magi who came from Arabia worshipped Him, 
coming first to Herod, who then was sovereign in your land, and whom the 
Scripture calls king of Assyria on account of his ungodly and sinful character. 
For you know," continued I, "that the Holy Spirit oftentimes announces such 
events by parables and similitudes; just as He did towards all the people in 
Jerusalem, frequently saying to them, 'Thy father is an Amorite, and thy mother 
a Hittite. 
CHAPTER LXXVIII -- HE PROVES THAT THIS PROPHECY HARMONIZES WITH CHRIST ALONE, 
FROM WHAT IS AFTERWARDS WRITTEN. 
"Now this king Herod, at the time when the Magi came to him from Arabia, and 
said they knew from a star which appeared in the heavens that a King had been 
born in your country, and that they had come to worship Him, learned from the 
elders of your people that it was thus written regarding Bethlehem in the 
prophet: 'And thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art by no means least among 
the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall go forth the leader who shall feed 
my people.' Accordingly the Magi from Arabia came to Bethlehem and worshipped 
the Child, and presented Him with gifts, gold and frankincense, and myrrh; but 
returned not to Herod, being warned in a revelation after worshipping the Child 
in Bethlehem. And Joseph, the spouse of Mary, who wished at first to put away 
his betrothed Mary, supposing her to be pregnant by intercourse with a man, 
i.e., from fornication, was commanded in a vision not to put away his wife; and 
the angel who appeared to him told him that what is in her womb is of the Holy 
Ghost. Then he was afraid, and did not put her away; but on the occasion of the 
first census which was taken in Jud a, under Cyrenius, he went up from Nazareth, 
where he lived, to Bethlehem, to which he belonged, to be enrolled; for his 
family was of the tribe of Judah, which then inhabited that region. Then along 
with Mary he is ordered to proceed into Egypt, and remain there with the Child 
until another revelation warn them to return into Jud a. But when the Child was 
born in Bethlehem, since Joseph could not find a lodging in that village, he 
took up his quarters in a certain cave near the village; and while they were 
there Mary brought forth the Christ and placed Him in a manger, and here the 
Magi who came from Arabia found Him. I have repeated to you," I continued, "what 
Isaiah foretold about the sign which foreshadowed the cave; but for the sake of 
those who have come with us to-day, I shall again remind you of the passage." 
Then I repeated the passage from Isaiah which I have already written, adding 
that, by means of those words, those who presided over the mysteries of Mithras 
were stirred up by the devil to say that in a place, called among them a cave, 
they were initiated by him. "So Herod, when the Magi from Arabia did not return 
to him, as he had asked them to do, but had departed by another way to their own 
country, according to the commands laid on them; and when Joseph, with Mary and 
the Child, had now gone into Egypt, as it was revealed to them to do; as he did 
not know the Child whom the Magi had gone to worship, ordered simply the whole 
of the children then in Bethlehem to be massacred. And Jeremiah prophesied that 
this would happen, speaking by the Holy Ghost thus: 'A voice was heard in Ramah, 
lamentation and much wailing, Rachel weeping for her children; and she would not 
be comforted, because they are not.' Therefore, on account of the voice which 
would be heard from Ramah, i.e., from Arabia(for there is in Arabia at this very 
time a place called Rama), wailing would come on the place where Rachel the wife 
of Jacob called lsrael, the holy patriarch, has been buried, i.e., on Bethlehem; 
while the women weep for their own slaughtered children, and have no consolation 
by reason of what has happened to them. For that expression of Isaiah 'He shall 
take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria,' foretold that the power of 
the evil demon that dwelt in Damascus should be overcome by Christ as soon as He 
was born; and this is proved to have happened. For the Magi, who were held in 
bondage for the commission of all evil deeds through the power of that demon, by 
coming to worship Christ, shows that they have revolted from that dominion which 
held them captive; and this[dominion] the Scripture has showed us to reside in 
Damascus. Moreover, that sinful and unjust power is termed well in parable, 
Samaria. And none of you can deny that Damascus was, and is, in the region of 
Arabia, although now it belongs to what is called Syrophoenicia. Hence it would 
be becoming for you, sirs, to learn what you have not perceived, from those who 
have received grace from God, namely, from us Christians; and not to strive in 
every way to maintain your own doctrines, dishonouring those of God. Therefore 
also this grace has been transferred to us, as Isaiah says, speaking to the 
following effect: 'This people draws near to Me, they honour Me with their lips, 
but their heart is far from Me; but in vain they worship Me, teaching the 
commands and doctrines of men. Therefore, behold, I will proceed to remove this 
people, and I shall remove them; and I shall take away the wisdom of their wise 
men, and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent men.' " 
CHAPTER LXXIX -- HE PROVES AGAINST TRYPHO THAT THE WICKED ANGELS HAVE 
REVOLTED FROM GOD. 
On this, Trypho, who was somewhat angry, but respected the Scriptures, as was 
manifest from his countenance, said to me, "The utterances of God are holy, but 
your expositions are mere contrivances, as is plain from what has been explained 
by you; nay, even blasphemies, for you assert that angels sinned and revolted 
from God." 
And I, wishing to get him to listen to me, answered in milder tones, thus: "I 
admire, sir, this piety of yours; and I pray that you may entertain the same 
disposition towards Him to whom angels are recorded to minister, as Daniel says; 
for[one] like the Son of man is led to the Ancient of days, and every kingdom is 
given to Him for ever and ever. But that you may know, sir," continued I, "that 
it is not our audacity which has induced us to adopt this exposition, which you 
reprehend, I shall give you evidence from Isaiah himself; for he affirms that 
evil angels have dwelt and do dwell in Tanis, in Egypt. These are[his] words: 
'Woe to the rebellious children! Thus saith the Lord, You have taken counsel, 
but not through Me; and[made] agreements, but not through My Spirit, to add sins 
to sins; who have sinned in going down to Egypt(but they have not inquired at 
Me), that they may be assisted by Pharaoh, and be covered with the shadow of the 
Egyptians. For the shadow of Pharaoh shall be a disgrace to you, and a reproach 
to those who trust in the Egyptians; for the princes in Tanis are evil angels. 
In vain will they labour for a people which will not profit them by assistance, 
but[will be] for a disgrace and a reproach[to them].' And, further, Zechariah 
tells, as you yourself have related, that the devil stood on the right hand of 
Joshua the priest, to resist him; and[the Lord] said, 'The Lord, who has taken 
Jerusalem, rebuke thee.' And again, it is written in Job, as you said yourself, 
how that the angels came to stand before the Lord, and the devil came with them. 
And we have it recorded by Moses in the beginning of Genesis, that the serpent 
beguiled Eve, and was cursed. And we know that in Egypt there were magicians who 
emulated the mighty power displayed by God through the faithful servant Moses. 
And you are aware that David said, 'The gods of the nations are demons.'" 
CHAPTER LXXX -- THE OPINION OF JUSTIN WITH REGARD TO THE REIGN OF A THOUSAND 
YEARS. SEVERAL CATHOLICS REJECT IT. 
And Trypho to this replied, "I remarked to you sir, that you are very anxious 
to be safe in all respects, since you cling to the Scriptures. But tell me, do 
you really admit that this place, Jerusalem, shall be rebuilt; and do you expect 
your people to be gathered together, and made joyful with Christ and the 
patriarchs, and the prophets, both the men of our nation, and other proselytes 
who joined them before your Christ came? or have you given way, and admitted 
this in order to have the appearance of worsting us in the controversies?" 
Then I answered, "I am not so miserable a fellow, Trypho, as to say one thing 
and think another. I admitted to you formerly, that I and many others are of 
this opinion, and[believe] that such will take place, as you assuredly are 
aware; but, on the other hand, I signified to you that many who belong to the 
pure and pious faith, and are true Christians, think otherwise. Moreover, I 
pointed out to you that some who are called Christians, but are godless, impious 
heretics, teach doctrines that are in every way blasphemous, atheistical, and 
foolish. But that you may know that I do not say this before you alone, I shall 
draw up a statement, so far as I can, of all the arguments which have passed 
between us; in which I shall record myself as admitting the very same things 
which I admit to you. For I choose to follow not men or men's doctrines, but God 
and the doctrines[delivered] by Him. For if you have fallen in with some who are 
called Christians, but who do not admit this[truth], and venture to blaspheme 
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; who say there is 
no resurrection of the dead, and that their souls, when they die, are taken to 
heaven; do not imagine that they are Christians, even as one, if he would 
rightly consider it, would not admit that the Sadducees, or similar sects of 
Genist , Meristae,Gelilaeans, Hellenists, Pharisees, Baptists, are Jews(do not 
hear me impatiently when I tell you what I think), but are[only] called Jews and 
children of Abraham, worshipping God with the lips, as God Himself declared, but 
the heart was far from Him. But I and others, who are right-minded Christians on 
all points, are assured that there will be a resurrection of the dead, and a 
thousand years in Jerusalem, which will then be built, adorned, and enlarged, 
the prophets Ezekiel and Isaiah and others declare. 
CHAPTER LXXXI -- HE ENDEAVOURS TO PROVE THIS OPINION FROM ISAIAH AND THE 
APOCALYPSE. 
"For Isaiah spake thus concerning this space of a thousand years: 'For there 
shall be the new heaven and the new earth, and the former shall not be 
remembered, or come into their heart; but they shall find joy and gladness in 
it, which things I create. For, Behold, I make Jerusalem a rejoicing, and My 
people a joy; and I shall rejoice over Jerusalem, and be glad over My I people. 
And the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, or the voice of crying. 
And there shall be no more there a person of immature years, or an old man who 
shall not fulfil his days. For the young man shall be an hundred years old; but 
the sinner who dies an hundred years old, he shall be accursed. And they shall 
build houses, and shall themselves inhabit them; and they shall plant vines, and 
shall themselves eat the produce of them, and drink the wine. They shall not 
build, and others inhabit; they shall not plant, and others eat. For according 
to the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people; the works of 
their toil shall abound. Mine elect shall not toil fruitlessly, or beget 
children to be cursed; for they shall be a seed righteous and blessed by the 
Lord, and their offspring with them. And it shall come to pass, that before they 
call I will hear; while they are still speaking, I shall say, What is it? Then 
shall the wolves and the lambs feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like 
the ox; but the serpent[shall eat] earth as bread. They shall not hurt or 
maltreat each other on the holy mountain, i saith the Lord.' Now we have 
understood that the expression used among these words, 'According to the days of 
the tree[of life] shall be the days of my people; the works of their toil shall 
abound' obscurely predicts a thousand years. For as Adam was told that in the 
nay fie ate of the tree he would die, we know that he did not complete a 
thousand years. We have perceived, moreover, that the expression, 'The day of 
the Lord is as a thousand years,' is connected with this subject. And further, 
there was a certain man with us, whose name was John, one of the apostles of 
Christ, who prophesied, by a revelation that was made to him, that those who 
believed in our Christ would dwell a thousand years in Jerusalem; and that 
thereafter the general, and, in short, the eternal resurrection and judgment of 
all men would likewise take place. Just as our Lord also said, 'They shall 
neither marry nor be given in marriage, but shall be equal to the angels, the 
children of the God of the resurrection.' 
CHAPTER LXXXII -- THE PROPHETICAL GIFTS OF THE JEWS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE 
CHRISTIANS. 
"For the prophetical gifts remain with us, even to the present time. And 
hence you ought to understand that[the gifts] formerly among your nation have 
been transferred to us. And just as there were false prophets contemporaneous 
with your holy prophets, so are there now many false teachers amongst us, of 
whom our Lord forewarned us to beware; so that in no respect are we deficient, 
since we know that He foreknew all that would happen to us after His 
resurrection from the dead and ascension to heaven. For He said we would be put 
to death, and hated for His name's sake; and that many false prophets and false 
Christs would appear in His name, and deceive many: and so has it come about. 
For many have taught godless, blasphemous, and unholy doctrines, forging them in 
His name; have taught, too, and even yet are teaching, those things which 
proceed from the unclean spirit of the devil, and which were put into their 
hearts. Therefore we are most anxious that you be persuaded not to be misled by 
such persons, since we know that every one who can speak the truth, and yet 
speaks it not, shall be judged by God, as God testified by Ezekiel, when He 
said, 'I have made thee a watchman to the house of Judah. If the sinner sin, and 
thou warn him not, he himself shall die in his sin; but his blood will I require 
at thine hand. But if thou warn him, thou shalt be innocent.' And on this 
account we are, through fear, very earnest in desiring to converse[with men] 
according to the Scriptures, but not from love of money, or of glory, or of 
pleasure. For no man can convict us of any of these[vices]. No more do we wish 
to live like the rulers of your people, whom God reproaches when He says, 'Your 
rulers are companions of thieves, lovers of bribes, followers of the rewards.' 
Now, if you know certain amongst us to be of this sort, do not for their sakes 
blaspheme the Scriptures and Christ, and do not assiduously strive to give 
falsified interpretations. 
CHAPTER LXXXIII -- IT IS PROVED THAT THE PSALM, "THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD," 
ETC., DOES NOT SUIT HEZEKIAH. 
"For your teachers have ventured to refer the passage, 'The Lord says to my 
Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool,' to 
Hezekiah; as if he were requested to sit on the right side of the temple, when 
the king of Assyria sent to him and threatened him; and he was told by Isaiah 
not to be afraid. Now we know and admit that what Isaiah said took place; that 
the king of Assyria desisted from waging war against Jerusalem in Hezekiah's 
days, and the angel of the Lord slew about 185,000 of the host of the Assyrians. 
But it is manifest that the Psalm does not refer to him. For thus it is written, 
'The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy 
footstool. He shall send forth a rod of power over Jerusalem, and it shall rule 
in the midst of Thine enemies. In the splendour of the saints before the morning 
star have I begotten Thee. The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a 
priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.' Who does not admit, then, that 
Hezekiah is no priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek? And who does not 
know that he is not the redeemer of Jerusalem? And who does not know that he 
neither sent a rod of power into Jerusalem, nor ruled in the midst of his 
enemies; but that it was God who averted from him the enemies, after he mourned 
and was afflicted? But our Jesus, who has not yet come in glory, has sent into 
Jerusalem a rod of power, namely, the word of calling and repentance[meant] for 
all nations over which demons held sway, as David says, 'The gods of the nations 
are demons.' And His strong word has prevailed on many to forsake the demons 
whom they used to serve, and by means of it to believe in the Almighty God 
because the gods of the nations are demons. And we mentioned formerly that the 
statement, 'In the splendour of the saints before the morning star have I 
begotten Thee from the womb,' is made to Christ. 
CHAPTER LXXXIV -- THAT PROPHECY, "BEHOLD, A VIRGIN," ETC., SUITS CHRIST 
ALONE. 
"Moreover, the prophecy, 'Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,' 
was uttered respecting Him. For if He to whom Isaiah referred was not to be 
begotten of a virgin, of whom did the Holy Spirit declare, 'Behold, the Lord 
Himself shall give us a sign: behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear a 
son?' For if He also were to be begotten of sexual intercourse, like all other 
first-born sons, why did God say that He would give a sign which is not common 
to all the first-born sons? But that which is truly a sign, and which was to be 
made trustworthy to mankind,--namely, that the first-begotten of all creation 
should become incarnate by the Virgin's womb, and be a child,--this he 
anticipated by the Spirit of prophecy, and predicted it, as I have repeated to 
you, in various ways; in order that, when the event should take place, it might 
be known as the operation of the power and will of the Maker of all things; just 
as Eve was made from one of Adam's ribs, and as all living beings were created 
in the beginning by the word of God. But you in these matters venture to pervert 
the expositions which your elders that were with Ptolemy king of Egypt gave 
forth, since you assert that the Scripture is not so as they have expounded it, 
but says, 'Behold, the young woman shall conceive,' as if great events were to 
be inferred if a woman should beget from sexual intercourse: which indeed all 
young women, with the exception of the barren, do; but even these, God, if He 
wills, is able to cause[to bear]. For Samuel's mother, who was barren, brought 
forth by l the will of God; and so also the wife of the holy patriarch Abraham; 
and Elisabeth, who bore John the Baptist, and other such. So that you must not 
suppose that it is impossible for God to do anything He wills. And especially 
when it was predicted that this would take place, do not venture to pervert or 
misinterpret the prophecies, since you will injure yourselves alone, and will 
not harm God. 
CHAPTER LXXXV -- HE PROVES THAT CHRIST IS THE LORD OF HOSTS FROM PS. XXIV., 
AND FROM HIS AUTHORITY OVER DEMONS. 
"Moreover, some of you venture to expound the prophecy which runs, 'Lift up 
your gates, ye rulers; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of 
glory may enter,' as if it referred likewise to Hezekiah, and others of 
you[expound it] of Solomon; but neither to the latter nor to the former, nor, in 
short, to any of your kings, can it be proved to have reference, but to this our 
Christ alone, who appeared without comeliness, and inglorious, as Isaiah and 
David and all the Scriptures said; who is the Lord of hosts, by the will of the 
Father who conferred on Him[the dignity]; who also rose from the dead, and 
ascended to heaven, as the Psalm and the other Scriptures manifested when they 
announced Him to be Lord of hosts; and of this you may, if you will, easily be 
persuaded by the occurrences which take place before your eyes. For every demon, 
when exorcised in the name of this very Son of God--who is the First-born of 
every creature, who became man by the Virgin, who suffered, and was crucified 
under Pontius Pilate by your nation, who died, who rose from the dead, and 
ascended into heaven--is overcome and subdued. But though you exorcise any demon 
in the name of any of those who were amongst you--either kings, or righteous 
men, or prophets, or patriarchs--it will not be subject to you. But if any of 
you exorcise it in[the name of] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and 
the God of Jacob, it will perhaps be subject to you. Now assuredly your 
exorcists, I have said, make use of craft when they exorcise, even as the 
Gentiles do, and employ fumigations and incantations. But that they are angels 
and powers whom the word of prophecy by David[commands] to lift up the gates, 
that He who rose from the dead, Jesus Christ, the Lord of hosts, according to 
the will of the Father, might enter, the word of David has likewise showed; 
which I shall again recall to your attention for the sake of those who were not 
with us yesterday, for whose benefit, moreover, I sum up many things I said 
yesterday. And now, if I say this to you, although I have repeated it many 
times, I know that it is not absurd so to do. For it is a ridiculous thing to 
see the sun, and the moon, and the other stars, continually keeping the same 
course, and bringing round the different seasons; and to see the computer who 
may be asked how many are twice two, because he has frequently said that they 
are four, not ceasing to say again that they late four; and equally so other 
things, which are confidently admitted, to be continually mentioned and admitted 
in like manner; yet that he who founds his discourse on the prophetic Scriptures 
should leave them and abstain from constantly referring to the same Scriptures, 
because it is thought he can bring forth something better than Scripture. The 
passage, then, by which I proved that God reveals that there are both angels and 
hosts in heaven is this: 'Praise the Lord from the heavens: praise Him in the 
highest. Praise Him, all His angels: praise Him, all His hosts.' " 
Then one of those who had come with them on the second day, whose name was 
Mnaseas, said, "We are greatly pleased that you undertake to repeat the same 
things on our account." 
And I said, "Listen, my friends, to the Scripture which induces me to act 
thus. Jesus commanded to love even[our] enemies, as was predicted by Isaiah in 
many passages, in which also is contained the mystery of our own regeneration, 
as well, in fact, as the regeneration of all who expect that Christ will appear 
in Jerusalem, and by their works endeavour earnestly to please Him. These are 
the words spoken by Isaiah: 'Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at His 
word. Say, our brethren, to them that hate you and detest you, that the name of 
the Lord has been glorified. He has appeared to your joy, and they shall be 
ashamed. A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the 
Lord who rendereth recompense to the proud. Before she that travailed brought 
forth, and before the pains of labour came, she brought forth a male child. Who 
hath heard such a thing? and who hath seen such a thing? has the earth brought 
forth in one day? and has she produced a nation at once? for Zion has travailed 
and borne her children. But I haye given such an expectation even to her that 
does not bring forth, said the Lord. Behold, I have made her that begetteth, and 
her that is barren, saith the Lord. Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and hold a joyous 
assembly, all ye that love her. Be glad, all ye that mourn for her, that ye may 
suck and be filled with the breast of her consolation, that having suck ye may 
be delighted with the entrance of His glory.' " 
CHAPTER LXXXVI -- THERE ARE VARIOUS FIGURES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT OF THE WOOD 
OF THE CROSS BY WHICH CHRIST REIGNED. 
And when I had quoted this, I added, "Hear, then, how this Man, of whom the 
Scriptures declare that He will come again in glory after His crucifixion, was 
symbolized both by the tree of life, which was said to have been planted in 
paradise, and by those events which should happen to all the just. Moses was 
sent with a rod to effect the redemption of the people; and with this in his 
hands at the head of the people, he divided the sea. By this he saw the water 
gushing out of the rock; and when he cast a tree into the waters of Marah, which 
were bitter, he made them sweet. Jacob, by putting rods into the water-troughs, 
caused the sheep of his uncle to conceive, so that he should obtain their young. 
With his rod the same Jacob boasts that he had crossed the river. He said he had 
seen a ladder, and the Scripture has declared that God stood above it. But that 
this was not the Father, we have proved from the Scriptures. And Jacob, having 
poured oil on a stone in the same place, is testified to by the very God who 
appeared to him, that he had anointed a pillar to the God who appeared to him. 
And that the stone symbolically proclaimed Christ, we have also proved by many 
Scriptures; and that the unguent, whether it was of oil, or of stacte, or 
of any other compounded sweet balsams, had reference to Him, we have also 
proved, inasmuch as the word says: 'Therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed 
Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.' For indeed all kings and 
anointed persons obtained from Him their share in the names of kings and 
anointed: just as He Himself received from the Father the titles of King, and 
Christ, and Priest, and Angel, and such like other titles which He bears or did 
bear. Aaron's rod, which blossomed, declared him to be the high priest. Isaiah 
prophesied that a rod would come forth from the root of Jesse,[and this was] 
Christ. And David says that the righteous man is 'like the tree that is planted 
by the channels of waters, which should yield its fruit in its season, and whose 
leaf should not fade.' Again, the righteous is said to flourish like the 
palm-tree. God appeared from a tree to Abraham, as it is written, near the oak 
in Mature. The people found seventy willows and twelve springs after crossing 
the Jordan. David affirms that God comforted him with a rod and staff. Elisha, 
by casting a stick into the river Jordan, recovered the iron part of the axe 
with which the sons of the prophets had gone to cut down trees to build the 
house in which they wished to read and study the law and commandments of God; 
even as our Christ, by being crucified on the tree, and by purifying with water, 
has redeemed us, though plunged in the direst offences which we have committed, 
and has made a house of prayer and adoration. Moreover, it was a rod that 
pointed out Judah to be the father of Tamar's sons by a great mystery." 
CHAPTER LXXXVII -- TRYPHO MAINTAINS IN OBJECTION THESE WORDS: "AND SHALL REST 
ON HIM," ETC. THEY ARE EXPLAINED BY JUSTIN. 
Hereupon Trypho, after I had spoken these words, said, "Do not now suppose 
that I am endeavouring, by asking what I do ask, to overturn the statements you 
have made; but I wish to receive information respecting those very points about 
which I now inquire. Tell me, then, how, when the Scripture asserts by Isaiah, 
'There shall come forth a rod from the root of Jesse; and a flower shall grow up 
from the root of Jesse; and the Spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of 
wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of 
knowledge and piety: and the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him:' 
(now you admitted to me," continued he, "that this referred to Christ, and you 
maintain Him to be pre-existent God, and having become incarnate by God's will, 
to be born man by the Virgin:) how He can be demonstrated to have been 
pre-existent, who is filled with the powers of the Holy Ghost, which the 
Scripture by Isaiah enumerates, as if He were in lack of them?" 
Then I replied, "You have inquired most discreetly and most prudently, for 
truly there does seem to be a difficulty; but listen to what I say, that you may 
perceive the reason of this also. The Scripture says that these enumerated 
powers of the Spirit have come on Him, not because He stood in need of them, but 
because they would rest in Him, i.e., would find their accomplishment in Him, so 
that there would be no more prophets in your nation after the ancient custom: 
and this fact you plainly perceive. For after Him no prophet has arisen among 
you. Now, that [you may know that] your prophets, each receiving some one or two 
powers from God, did and spoke the things which we have learned from the 
Scriptures, attend to the following remarks of mine. Solomon possessed the 
spirit of wisdom, Daniel that of understanding and counsel, Moses that of might 
and piety, Elijah that of fear, and Isaiah that of knowledge; and so with the 
others: each possessed one power, or one joined alternately with another; also 
Jeremiah, and the twelve [prophets], and David, and, in short, the rest who 
existed amongst you. Accordingly He rested, i.e., ceased, when He came, 
after whom, in the times of this dispensation wrought out by Him amongst men, it 
was requisite that such gifts should cease from you; and having received their 
rest in Him, should again, as had been predicted, become gifts which, from the 
grace of His Spirit's power, He imparts to those who believe in Him, according 
as He deems each man worthy thereof. I have already said, and do again say, that 
it had been prophesied that this would be done by Him after His ascension to 
heaven. It is accordingly said, 'He ascended on high, He led captivity captive, 
He gave gifts unto the sons of men.' And again, in another prophecy it is said: 
'And it shall come to pass after this, I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh, 
and on My servants, and on My handmaids, and they shall prophesy.' 
CHAPTER LXXXVIII -- CHRIST HAS NOT RECEIVED THE HOLY SPIRIT ON ACCOUNT OF 
POVERTY. 
"Now, it is possible to see amongst us women and men who possess gifts of the 
Spirit of God; so that it was prophesied that the powers enumerated by Isaiah 
would come upon Him, not because He needed power, but because these would not 
continue after Him. And let this be a proof to you, namely, what I told you was 
done by the Magi from Arabia, who as soon as the Child was born came to worship 
Him, for even at His birth He was in possession of His power; and as He grew up 
like all other men, by using the fitting means, He assigned its own 
[requirements] to each development, and was sustained by all kinds of 
nourishment, and waited for thirty years, more or less, until John appeared 
before Him as the herald of His approach, and preceded Him in the way of 
baptism, as I have already shown. And then, when Jesus had gone to the river 
Jordan, where John was baptizing, and when He had stepped into the water, a fire 
was kindled in the Jordan; and when He came out of the water, the Holy Ghost 
lighted on Him like a dove, the apostles of this very Christ of ours wrote. Now, 
we know that he did not go to the river because He stood in need of baptism, or 
of the descent of the Spirit like a dove; even as He submitted to be born and to 
be crucified, not because He needed such things, but because of the human race, 
which from Adam had fallen under the power of death and the guile of the 
serpent, and each one of which had committed personal transgression. For God, 
wishing both angels and men, who were endowed with freewill, and at their own 
disposal, to do whatever He had strengthened each to do, made them so, that if 
they chose the things acceptable to Himself, He would keep them free from death 
and from punishment; but that if they did evil, He would punish each as He sees 
fit. For it was not His entrance into Jerusalem sitting on an ass, which we have 
showed was prophesied, that empowered Him to be Christ, but it furnished men 
with a proof that He is the Christ; just as it was necessary in the time of John 
that men have proof, that they might know who is Christ. For when John remained 
by the Jordan, and preached the baptism of repentance, wearing only a leathern 
girdle and a vesture made of camels' hair, eating nothing but locusts and wild 
honey, men supposed him to be Christ; but he cried to them, 'I am not the 
Christ, but the voice of one crying; for He that is stronger than I shall come, 
whose shoes I am not worthy to bear.' And when Jesus came to the Jordan, He was 
considered to be the son of Joseph the carpenter; and He appeared without 
comeliness, as the Scriptures declared; and He was deemed a carpenter (for He 
was in the habit of working as a carpenter when among men, making ploughs and 
yokes; by which He taught the symbols of righteousness and an active life); but 
then the Holy Ghost, and for man's sake, as I formerly stated, lighted on Him in 
the form of a dove, and there came at the same instant from the heavens a voice, 
which was uttered also by David when he spoke, personating Christ, what the 
Father would say to Him: 'Thou art My Son: this day have I begotten Thee;' [the 
Father] saying that His generation would take place for men, at the time when 
they would become acquainted with Him: 'Thou art My Son; this day have I 
begotten thee.' " 
CHAPTER LXXXIX -- THE CROSS ALONE IS OFFENSIVE TO TRYPHO ON ACCOUNT OF THE 
CURSE, YET IT PROVES THAT JESUS IS CHRIST. 
Then Trypho remarked, "Be assured that all our nation waits for Christ; and 
we admit that all the Scriptures which you have quoted refer to Him. Moreover, I 
do also admit that the name of Jesus, by which the the son of Nave (Nun) was 
called, has inclined me very strongly to adopt this view. But whether Christ 
should be so shamefully crucified, this we are in doubt about. For whosoever is 
crucified is said in the law to be accursed, so that I am exceedingly 
incredulous on this point. It is quite clear, indeed, that the Scriptures 
announce that Christ had to suffer; but we wish to learn if you can prove it to 
us whether it was by the suffering cursed in the law." 
I replied to him, "If Christ was not to suffer, and the prophets had not 
foretold that He would be led to death on account of the sins of the people, and 
be dishonoured and scourged, and reckoned among the transgressors, and as a 
sheep be led to the slaughter, whose generation, the prophet says, no man can 
declare, then you would have good cause to wonder. But if these are to be 
characteristic of Him and mark Him out to all, how is it possible for us to do 
anything else than believe in Him most confidently? And will not as many as have 
understood the writings of the prophets, whenever they hear merely that He was 
crucified, say that this is He and no other?" 
CHAPTER XC -- THE STRETCHED-OUT HANDS OF MOSES SIGNIFIED BEFOREHAND THE 
CROSS. 
"Bring us on, then," said [Trypho], "by the Scriptures, that we may also be 
persuaded by you; for we know that He should suffer and be led as a sheep. But 
prove to us whether He must be crucified and die so disgracefully and so 
dishonourably by the death cursed in the law. For we cannot bring ourselves even 
to think of this." 
"You know," said I, "that what the prophets said and did they veiled by 
parables and types, as you admitted to us; so that it was not easy for all to 
understand the most [of what they said], since they concealed the truth by these 
means, that those who are eager to find out and learn it might do so with much 
labour." 
They answered, "We admitted this." 
"Listen, therefore," say I, "to what follows; for Moses first exhibited this 
seeming curse of Christ's by the signs which he made." 
"Of what [signs] do you speak?" said he. 
"When the people," replied I, "waged war with Amalek, and the son of Nave 
(Nun) by name Jesus (Joshua), led the fight, Moses himself prayed to God, 
stretching out both hands, and Hur with Aaron supported them during the whole 
day, so that they might not hang down when he got wearied. For if he gave up any 
part of this sign, which was an imitation of the cross, the people were beaten, 
as is recorded in the writings of Moses; but if he remained in this form, Amalek 
was proportionally defeated, and he who prevailed prevailed by the cross. For it 
was not because Moses so prayed that the people were stronger, but because, 
while one who bore the name of Jesus (Joshua) was in the forefront of the 
battle, he himself made the sign of the cross. For who of you knows not that the 
prayer of one who accompanies it with lamentation and tears, with the body 
prostrate, or with bended knees, propitiates God most of all? But in such a 
manner neither he nor any other one, while sitting on a stone, prayed. Nor even 
the stone symbolized Christ, as I have shown. 
CHAPTER XCI -- THE CROSS WAS FORETOLD IN THE BLESSINGS OF JOSEPH, AND IN THE 
SERPENT THAT WAS LIFTED UP.. 
"And God by Moses shows in another way the force of the mystery of the cross, 
when He said in the blessing wherewith Joseph was blessed, 'From the blessing of 
the Lord is his land; for the seasons of heaven, and for the dews, and for the 
deep springs from beneath, and for the seasonable fruits of the sun, and for the 
coming together of the months, and for the heights of the everlasting mountains, 
and for the heights of the hills, and for the ever-flowing rivers, and for the 
fruits of the fatness of the earth; and let the things accepted by Him who 
appeared in the bush come on the head and crown of Joseph. Let him be glorified 
among his brethren; his beauty is [like] the firstling of a bullock; his horns 
the horns of an unicorn: with these shall he push the nations from one end of 
the earth to another.' Now, no one could say or prove that the horns of an 
unicorn represent any other fact or figure than the type which portrays the 
cross. For the one beam is placed upright, from which the highest extremity is 
raised up into a horn, when the other beam is fitted on to it, and the ends 
appear on both sides as horns joined on to the one horn. And the part which is 
fixed in the centre, on which are suspended those who are crucified, also stands 
out like a horn; and it also looks like a horn conjoined and fixed with the 
other horns. And the expression, 'With these shall he push as with horns the 
nations from one end of the earth to another,' is indicative of what is now the 
fact among all the nations. For some out of all the nations, through the power 
of this mystery, having been so pushed, that is, pricked in their hearts, have 
turned from vain idols and demons to serve God. But the same figure is revealed 
for the destruction and condemnation of the unbelievers; even as Amalek was 
defeated and Israel victorious when the people came out of Egypt, by means of 
the type of the stretching out of Moses' hands, and the name of Jesus (Joshua), 
by which the son of Nave (Nun) was called. And it seems that the type and sign, 
which was erected to counteract the serpents which bit Israel, was intended for 
the salvation of those who believe that death was declared to come thereafter on 
the serpent through Him that would be crucified, but salvation to those who had 
been bitten by him and had betaken themselves to Him that sent His Son into the 
world to be crucified. For the Spirit of prophecy by Moses did not teach us to 
believe in the serpent, since it shows us that he was cursed by God from the 
beginning; and in Isaiah tells us that he shall be put to death as an enemy by 
the mighty sword, which is Christ. 
CHAPTER XCII -- UNLESS THE SCRIPTURES BE UNDERSTOOD THROUGH GOD'S GREAT 
GRACE, GOD WILL NOT APPEAR TO HAVE TAUGHT ALWAYS THE SAME RIGHTEOUSNESS.. 
"Unless, therefore, a man by God's great grace receives the power to 
understand what has been said and done by the prophets, the appearance of being 
able to repeat the words or the deeds will not profit him, if he cannot explain 
the argument of them. And will they not assuredly appear contemptible to many, 
since they are related by those who understood them not? For if one should wish 
to ask you why, since Enoch, Noah with his sons, and all others in similar 
circumstances, who neither were circumcised nor kept the Sabbath, pleased God, 
God demanded by other leaders, and by the giving of the law after the lapse of 
so many generations, that those who lived between the times of Abraham and of 
Moses be justified by circumcision, and that those who lived after Moses be 
justified by circumcision and the other ordinances--to wit, the Sabbath, and 
sacrifices, and libations, and offerings; [God will be slandered] unless you 
show, as I have already said, that God who foreknew was aware that your nation 
would deserve expulsion from Jerusalem, and that none would be permitted to 
enter into it.(For you are not distinguished in any other way than by the 
fleshly circumcision, as I remarked previously. For Abraham was declared by God 
to be righteous, not on account of circumcision, but on account of faith. For 
before he was circumcised the following statement was made regarding him: 
'Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness.' And we, 
therefore, in the uncircumcision of our flesh, believing God through Christ, and 
having that circumcision which is of advantage to us who have acquired 
it--namely, that of the heart--we hope to appear righteous before and 
well-pleasing to God: since already we have received His testimony through the 
words of the prophets.) [And, further, God will be slandered unless you show] 
that you were commanded to observe the Sabbath, and to present offerings, and 
that the Lord submitted to have a place called by the name of God, in order 
that, as has been said, you might not become impious and godless by worshipping 
idols and forgetting God, as indeed you do always appear to have been. (Now, 
that God enjoined the ordinances of Sabbaths and offerings for these reasons, I 
have proved in what I previously remarked; but for the sake of those who came 
to-day, I wish to repeat nearly the whole.) For if this is not the case, God 
will be slandered, as having no foreknowledge, and as not teaching all men to 
know and to do the same acts of righteousness (for many. generations of men 
appear to have existed before Moses); and the Scripture is not true which 
affirms that 'God is true and righteous, and all His ways are judgments, and 
there is no unrighteousness in him.' But since the Scripture is true, God is 
always willing that such even as you be neither foolish nor lovers of 
yourselves, in order that you may obtain the salvation of Christ, who pleased 
God, and received testimony from Him, as I have already said, by alleging proof 
from the holy words of prophecy. 
CHAPTER XCIII -- THE SAME KIND OF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS BESTOWED ON ALL. CHRIST 
COMPREHENDS IT IN TWO PRECEPTS. 
"For [God] sets before every race of mankind that which is always and 
universally just, as well as all righteousness; and every race knows that 
adultery, and fornication, and homicide, and such like, are sinful; and though 
they all commit such practices, yet they do not escape from the knowledge that 
they act unrighteously whenever they so do, with the exception of those who are 
possessed with an unclean spirit, and who have been debased by education, by 
wicked customs, and by sinful institutions, and who have lost, or rather 
quenched and put under, their natural ideas. For we may see that such persons 
are unwilling to submit to the same things which they inflict upon others, and 
reproach each other with hostile consciences for the acts which they perpetrate. 
And hence I think that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ spoke well when He 
summed up all righteousness and piety in two commandments. They are these: 'Thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy strength, and 
thy neighbour as thyself.' For the man who loves God with all the heart, and 
with all the strength, being filled with a God-fearing mind, will reverence no 
other god; and since God wishes it, he would reverence that angel who is beloved 
by the same Lord and God. And the man who loves his neighbour as himself will 
wish for him the same good things that he wishes for himself, and no man will 
wish evil things for himself. Accordingly, he who loves his neighbour would pray 
and labour that his neighbour may be possessed of the same benefits as himself. 
Now nothing else is neighbour to man than that similarly-affectioned and 
reasonable being--man. Therefore, since all righteousness is divided into two 
branches, namely, in so far as it regards God and men, whoever, says the 
Scripture, loves the Lord God with all the heart, and all the strength, and his 
neighbour as himself, would be truly a righteous man. But you were never shown 
to be possessed of friendship or love either towards God, or towards the 
prophets, or towards yourselves, but, as is evident, you are ever found to be 
idolaters and murderers of righteous men, so that you laid hands even on Christ 
Himself; and to this very day you abide in your wickedness, execrating those who 
prove that this man who was crucified by you is the Christ. Nay, more than this, 
you suppose that He was crucified as hostile to and cursed by God, which 
supposition is the product of your most irrational mind. For though you have the 
means of understanding that this man is Christ from the signs given by Moses, 
yet you will not; but, in addition, fancying that we can have no arguments, you 
put whatever question comes into your minds, while you yourselves are at a loss 
for arguments whenever you meet with some firmly established Christian. 
CHAPTER XCIV -- IN WHAT SENSE HE WHO HANGS ON A TREE IS CURSED. 
"For tell me, was it not God who commanded by Moses that no image or likeness 
of anything which was in heaven above or which was on the earth should be made, 
and yet who caused the brazen serpent to be made by Moses in the wilderness, and 
set it up for a sign by which those bitten by serpents were saved? Yet is He 
free from unrighteousness. For by this, as I previously remarked, He proclaimed 
the mystery, by which He declared that He would break the power of the serpent 
which occasioned the transgression of Adam, and [would bring] to them that 
believe on Him [who was foreshadowed] by this sign, i.e., Him who was to be 
crucified, salvation from the fangs of the serpent, which are wicked deeds, 
idolatries, and other unrighteous acts. Unless the matter be so understood, give 
me a reason why Moses set up the brazen serpent for a sign, and bade those that 
were bitten gaze at it, and the wounded were healed; and this, too, when he had 
himself commanded that no likeness of anything whatsoever should be made." 
On this, another of those who came on the second day said, "You have spoken 
truly: we cannot give a reason. For I have frequently interrogated the teachers 
about this matter, and none of them gave me a reason: therefore continue what 
you are speaking; for we are paying attention while you unfold the mystery, on 
account of which the doctrines of the prophets are falsely slandered." 
Then I replied, "Just as God commanded the sign to be made by the brazen 
serpent, and yet He is blameless; even so, though a curse lies in the law 
against persons who are crucified, yet no curse lies on the Christ of God, by 
whom all that have committed things worthy of a curse are saved. 
CHAPTER XCV -- CHRIST TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE CURSE DUE TO US. 
"For the whole human race will be found to be under a curse. For it is 
written in the law of Moses, 'Cursed is every one that continueth not in all 
things that are written in the book of the law to do them.' And no one has 
accurately done all, nor will you venture to deny this; but some more and some 
less than others have observed the ordinances enjoined. But if those who are 
under this law appear to be under a curse for not having observed all the 
requirements, how much more shall all the nations appear to be under a curse who 
practise idolatry, who seduce youths, and commit other crimes? If, then, the 
Father of all wished His Christ for the whole human family to take upon Him the 
curses of all, knowing that, after He had been crucified and was dead, He would 
raise Him up, why do you argue about Him, who submitted to suffer these things 
according to the Father's will, as if He were accursed, and do not rather bewail 
yourselves? For although His Father caused Him to suffer these things in behalf 
of the human family, yet you did not commit the deed as in obedience to the will 
of God. For you did not practise piety when you slew the prophets. And let none 
of you say: If His Father wished Him to suffer this, in order that by His 
stripes the human race might be healed, we have done no wrong. If, indeed, you 
repent of your sins, and recognise Him to be Christ, and observe His 
commandments, then you may assert this; for, as I have said before, remission of 
sins shall be yours. But if you curse Him and them that believe on Him, and, 
when you have the power, put them to death, how is it possible that requisition 
shall not be made of you, as of unrighteous and sinful men, altogether 
hard-hearted and without understanding, because you laid your hands on Him? 
CHAPTER XCVI -- THAT CURSE WAS A PREDICTION OF THE THINGS WHICH THE JEWS 
WOULD DO. 
"For the statement in the law, 'Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,' 
confirms our hope which depends on the crucified Christ, not because He who has 
been crucified is cursed by God, but because God foretold that which would be 
done by you all, and by those like to your, who do not know that this is He who 
existed before all, who is the eternal Priest of God, and King, and Christ. And 
you clearly see that this has come to pass. For you curse in your synagogues all 
those who are called from Him Christians; and other nations effectively carry 
out the curse, putting to death those who simply confess themselves to be 
Christians; to all of whom we say, You are our brethren; rather recognise the 
truth of God. And while neither they nor you are persuaded by us, but strive 
earnestly to cause us to deny the name of Christ, we choose rather and submit to 
death, in the full assurance that all the good which God has promised through 
Christ He will reward us with. And in addition to all this we pray for you, that 
Christ may have mercy upon you. For He taught us to pray for our enemies also, 
saying, 'Love your enemies; be kind and merciful, as your heavenly Father is.' 
For we see that the Almighty God is kind and merciful, causing His sun to rise 
on the un-thankful and on the righteous, and sending rain on the holy and on the 
wicked; all of whom He has taught us He will judge. 
CHAPTER XCVII -- OTHER PREDICTIONS OF THE CROSS OF CHRIST. 
"For it was not without design that the prophet Moses, when Hur and Aaron 
upheld his hands, remained in this form until evening. For indeed the Lord 
remained upon the tree almost until evening, and they buried Him at eventide; 
then on the third day He rose again. This was declared by David thus: 'With my 
voice I cried to the Lord, and He heard me out of His holy hill. I laid me down, 
and slept; I awaked, for the Lord sustained me.' And Isaiah likewise mentions 
concerning Him the manner in which He would die, thus: 'I have spread out My 
hands unto a people disobedient, and gainsaying, that walk in a way which is not 
good.' And that He would rise again, Isaiah himself said: 'His burial has been 
taken away from the midst, and I will give the rich for His death.' And again, 
in other words, David in the twenty-first Psalm thus refers to the suffering and 
to the cross in a parable of mystery: 'They pierced my hands and my feet; they 
counted all my bones. They considered and gazed on me; they parted my garments 
among themselves, and cast lots upon my vesture.' For when they crucified Him, 
driving in the nails, they pierced His hands and feet; and those who crucified 
Him parted His garments among themselves, each casting lots for what he chose to 
have, and receiving according to the decision of the lot. And this very Psalm 
you maintain does not refer to Christ; for you are in all respects blind, and do 
not understand that no one in your nation who has been called King or Christ has 
ever had his hands or feet pierced while alive, or has died in this mysterious 
fashion--to wit, by the cross--save this Jesus alone. 
CHAPTER XCVIII -- PREDICTIONS OF CHRIST IN PS. XXII. 
"I shall repeat the whole Psalm, in order that you may hear His reverence to 
the Father, and how He refers all things to Him, and prays to be delivered by 
Him from this death; at the same time declaring in the Psalm who they are that 
rise up against Him, and showing that He has truly become man capable of 
suffering. It is as follows: 'O God, my God, attend to me why hast Thou forsaken 
me? The words of my transgressions are far from my salvation. O my God, I will 
cry to Thee in the day-time, and Thou wilt not hear; and in the night-season, 
and it is not for want of understanding in me. But Thou, the Praise of Israel, 
inhabitest the holy place. Our fathers trusted in Thee; they trusted, and Thou 
didst deliver them. They cried unto Thee, and were delivered: they trusted in 
Thee, and were not confounded. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, 
and despised of the people. All they that see me laughed me to scorn; they spake 
with the lips, they shook the head: He trusted on the Lord: let Him deliver him, 
let Him save him, since he desires Him. For Thou art He that took me out of the 
womb; my hope from the breasts of my mother I was cast upon Thee from the womb. 
Thou art my God from my mother's belly: be not far from me, for trouble is near; 
for there is none to help. Many calves have compassed me; fat bulls have beset 
me round. They opened their mouth upon me, as a ravening and roaring lion. All 
my bones are poured out and dispersed like water. My heart has become like wax 
melting in the midst of my belly. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and 
my tongue has cleaved to my throat; and Thou hast brought me into the dust of 
death. For many dogs have surrounded me; the assembly of the wicked have beset 
me round. They pierced my hands and my feet, they did tell all my bones. They 
did look and stare upon me; they parted my garments among them, and cast lots 
upon my vesture. But do not Thou remove Thine assist-ante from me, O Lord: give 
heed to help me; deliver my soul from the sword, and my only-begotten from the 
hand of the dog. Save me from the lion's mouth, and my humility from the horns 
of the unicorns. I will declare Thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the 
Church will I praise Thee. Ye that fear the Lord, praise Him: all ye the seed of 
Jacob, glorify Him. Let all the seed of Israel fear Him.' " 
CHAPTER XCIX -- IN THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE PSALM ARE CHRIST'S DYING WORDS. 
And when I had said these words, I continued: "Now I will demonstrate to you 
that the whole Psalm refers thus to Christ, by the words which I shall again 
explain. What is said at first--'O God, my God, attend to me: why hast Thou 
forsaken me?'--announced from the beginning that which was to be said in the 
time of Christ. For when crucified, He spake: 'O God, my God, why hast Thou 
forsaken me?' And what follows: 'The words of my transgressions are far from my 
salvation. O my God, I will cry to Thee in the day-time, and Thou wilt not hear; 
and in the night-season, and it is not for want of understanding in me.' These, 
as well as the things which He was to do, were spoken. For on the day on which 
He was to be crucified, having taken three of His disciples to the hill called 
Olivet, situated opposite to the temple in Jerusalem, He prayed in these words: 
'Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.' And again He prayed: 
"Not as I will, but as Thou wilt;' showing by this that He had become truly a 
suffering man. But lest any one should say, He did not know then that He had to 
suffer, He adds immediately in the Psalm: 'And it is not for want of under 
standing in me.' Even as there was no ignorance on God's part when He asked Adam 
where he was, or asked Cain where Abel was; but [it was done] to convince each 
what kind of man he was, and in order that through the record [of Scripture] we 
might have a knowledge of all: so likewise Christ declared that ignorance was 
not on His side, but on theirs, who thought that He was not the Christ, but 
fancied they would put Him to death, and that He, like some common mortal, would 
remain in Hades. 
CHAPTER C -- IN WHAT SENSE CHRIST IS [CALLED] JACOB, AND ISRAEL, AND SON OF 
MAN. 
"Then what follows--'But Thou, the praise of Israel, inhabitest the holy 
place'--declared that He is to do something worthy of praise and wonderment, 
being about to rise again from the dead on the third day after the crucifixion; 
and this He has obtained from the Father. For I have showed already that Christ 
is called both Jacob and Israel; and I have proved that it is not in the 
blessing of Joseph and Judah alone that what relates to Him was proclaimed 
mysteriously, but also in the Gospel it is written that He said: 'All things are 
delivered unto me by My Father;' and, 'No man knoweth the Father but the Son; 
nor the Son but the Father, and they to whom the Son will reveal Him.' 
Accordingly He revealed to us all that we have perceived by His grace out of the 
Scriptures, so that we know Him to be the first-begotten of God, and to be 
before all creatures; likewise to be the Son of the patriarchs, since He assumed 
flesh by the Virgin of their family, and submitted to become a man without 
comeliness, dishonoured, and subject to suffering. Hence, also, among His words 
He said, when He was discoursing about His future sufferings: "The Son of man 
must suffer many things, and be rejected by the Pharisees and Scribes, and be 
crucified, and on the third day rise again.' He said then that He was the Son of 
man, either because of His birth by the Virgin, who was, as I said, of the 
family of David and Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham; or because Adam was the 
father both of Himself and of those who have been first enumerated from whom 
Mary derives her descent. For we know that the fathers of women are the fathers 
likewise of those children whom their daughters bear. For [Christ] called one of 
His disciples--previously known by the name of Simon--Peter; since he recognised 
Him to be Christ the Son. of God, by the revelation of His Father: and since we 
find it recorded in the memoirs of His apostles that He is the Son of God, and 
since we call Him the Son, we have understood that He proceeded before all 
creatures from the Father by His power and will (for He is addressed in the 
writings of the prophets in one way or another as Wisdom, and the Day, and the 
East, and a Sword, and a Stone, and a Rod, and Jacob, and Israel); and that He 
became man by the Virgin, in order that the disobedience which proceeded from 
the serpent might receive its destruction in the same manner in which it derived 
its origin. For Eve, who was a virgin and undefiled, having conceived the word 
of the serpent, brought forth disobedience and death. But the Virgin Mary 
received faith and joy, when the angel Gabriel announced the good tidings to her 
that the Spirit of the Lord would come upon her, and the power of the Highest 
would overshadow her: wherefore also the Holy Thing begotten of her is the Son 
of God; and she replied, 'Be it unto me according to thy word.' And by her has 
He been born, to whom we have proved so many Scriptures refer, and by whom God 
destroys both the serpent and those angels and men who are like him; but works 
deliverance from death to those who repent of their wickedness and believe upon 
Him. 
CHAPTER CI -- CHRIST REFERS ALL THINGS TO THE FATHER 
"Then what follows of the Psalm is this, in which He says: 'Our fathers 
trusted in Thee; they trusted, and Thou didst deliver them. They cried unto 
Thee, and were not confounded. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, 
and despised of the people;' which show that He admits them to be His fathers, 
who trusted in God and were saved by Him, who also were the fathers of the 
Virgin, by whom He was born and became man; and He foretells that He shall be 
saved by the same God, but boasts not in accomplishing anything through His own 
will or might. For when on earth He acted in the very same manner, and answered 
to one who addressed Him as' Good Master:' Why callest thou me good? One is 
good, my Father who is in heaven.' But when He says, I am a worm, and no man; a 
reproach of men, and despised of the people,' He prophesied the things which do 
exist, and which happen to Him. For we who believe on Him are everywhere a 
reproach, 'despised of the people;' for, rejected and dishonoured by your 
nation, He suffered those indignities which you planned against Him. And the 
following: 'All they that see me laughed me to scorn; they spake with the lips, 
they shook the head: He trusted in the Lord; let Him deliver him, since he 
desires Him;' this likewise He foretold should happen to Him. For they that saw 
Him crucified shook their heads each one of them, and distorted their lips, and 
twisting their noses to each other, they spake in mockery the words which are 
recorded in the memoirs of His apostles: 'He said he was the Son of God: let him 
come down; let God save him.' 
CHAPTER CII -- THE PREDICTION OF THE EVENTS WHICH HAPPENED TO CHRIST WHEN HE 
WAS BORN. WHY GOD PERMITTED IT. 
"And what follows--'My hope from the breasts of my mother. On Thee have I 
been cast from the womb; from my mother's belly Thou art my God: for there is no 
helper. Many calves have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me round. They 
opened their mouth upon me, as a ravening and a roaring lion. All my bones are 
poured out and dispersed like water. My heart has become likes wax melting in 
the midst of my belly. My strength is become dry like a potsherd; and my tongue 
has cleaved to my throat'--foretold what would come to pass; for the statement, 
'My hope from the breasts of my mother,' [is thus explained]. As soon as He was 
born in Bethlehem, as I previously remarked, king Herod, having learned from the 
Arabian Magi about Him, made a plot to put Him to death and by God's command 
Joseph took Him with Mary and departed into Egypt. For the Father had decreed 
that He whom He had begotten should be put to death, but not before He had grown 
to manhood, and proclaimed the word which proceeded from Him. But if any of you 
say to us, Could not God rather have put Herod to death? I return answer by 
anticipation: Could not God have cut off in the beginning the serpent, so that 
he exist not, rather than have said, 'And I will put enmity between him and the 
woman, and between his seed and her seed?' Could He not have at once created a 
multitude of men? But yet, since He knew that it would be good, He created both 
angels and men free to do that which is righteous, and He appointed periods of 
time during which He knew it would be good for them to have the exercise of 
free-will; and because He likewise knew it would be good, He made general and 
particular judgments; each one's freedom of will, however, being guarded. Hence 
Scripture says the following, at the destruction of the tower, and division and 
alteration of tongues: 'And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they 
have all one language; and this they have begun to do: and now nothing will be 
restrained from them of all which they have attempted to do.' And the statement, 
'My strength is become dry like a potsherd, and my tongue has cleaved to my 
throat,' was also a prophecy of what would be done by Him according to the 
Father's will. For the power of His strong word, by which He always confuted the 
Pharisees and Scribes, and, in short, all your nation's teachers that questioned 
Him, had a cessation like a plentiful and strong spring, the waters of which 
have been turned off, when He kept silence, and chose to return no answer to any 
one in the presence of Pilate; as has been declared in the memoirs of His 
apostles, in order that what is recorded by Isaiah might have efficacious fruit, 
where it is written, 'The Lord gives me a tongue, that I may know when I ought 
to speak.' Again, when He said, 'Thou art my God; be not far from me,' He taught 
that all men ought to hope in God who created all things, and seek salvation and 
help from Him alone; and not suppose, as the rest of men do, that salvation can 
be obtained by birth, or wealth, or strength, or wisdom. And such have ever been 
your practices: at one time you made a calf, and always you have shown 
yourselves ungrateful, murderers of the righteous, and proud of your descent. 
For if the Son of God evidently states that He can be saved, [neither] because 
He is a son, nor because He is strong or wise, but that without God He cannot be 
saved, even though He be sinless, as Isaiah declares in words to the effect that 
even in regard to His very language He committed no sin (for He committed no 
iniquity or guile with His mouth), how do you or others who expect to be saved 
without this hope, suppose that you are not deceiving yourselves? 
CHAPTER CIII -- THE PHARISEES ARE THE BULLS: THE ROARING LION IS HEROD OR THE 
DEVIL. 
"Then what is next said in the Psalm--'For trouble is near, for there is none 
to help me. Many calves have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me round. They 
opened their mouth upon me as a ravening and roaring lion. All my bones are 
poured out and dispersed like water,'--was likewise a prediction of the events 
which happened to Him. For on that night when some of your nation, who had been 
sent by the Pharisees and Scribes, and teachers, came upon Him from the Mount of 
Olives, those whom Scripture called butting and prematurely destructive calves 
surrounded Him. And the expression, 'Fat bulls have beset me round,' He spoke 
beforehand of those who acted similarly to the calves, when He was led before 
your teachers. And the Scripture described them as bulls, since we know that 
bulls are authors of calves' existence. As therefore the bulls are the begetters 
of the calves, so your teachers were the cause why their children went out to 
the Mount of Olives to take Him and bring Him to them. And the expression, 'For 
there is none to help,' is also indicative of what took place. For there was not 
even a single man to assist Him as an innocent person. And the expression, 'They 
opened their mouth upon me like a roaring lion,' designates him who was then 
king of the Jews, and was called Herod, a successor of the Herod who, when 
Christ was born, slew all the infants in Bethlehem born about the same time, 
because he imagined that amongst them He would assuredly be of whom the Magi 
from Arabia had spoken; for he was ignorant of the will of Him that is stronger 
than all, how He had commanded Joseph and Mary to take the Child and depart into 
Egypt, and there to remain until a revelation should again be made to them to 
return into their own country. And there they did remain until Herod, who slew 
the infants in Bethlehem, was dead, and Archelaus had succeeded him. And he died 
before Christ came to the dispensation on the cross which was given Him by His 
Father. And when Herod succeeded Archelaus, having received the authority which 
had been allotted to him, Pilate sent to him by way of compliment Jesus bound; 
and God foreknowing that this would happen, had thus spoken: 'And they brought 
Him to the Assyrian, a present to the king.' Or He meant the devil by the lion 
roaring against Him: whom Moses calls the serpent, but in Job and Zechariah he 
is called the devil, and by Jesus is addressed as Satan, showing that a 
compounded name was acquired by him from the deeds which he performed. For 
'Sata' in the Jewish and Syrian tongue means apostate; and 'Nas' is the word 
from which he is called by interpretation the serpent, i.e., according to 
the interpretation of the Hebrew term, from both of which there arises the 
single word Satanas. For this devil, when [Jesus] went up from the river 
Jordan, at the time when the voice spake to Him, 'Thou art my Son: this day have 
I begotten Thee,' is recorded in the memoirs of the apostles to have come to Him 
and tempted Him, even so far as to say to Him, 'Worship me;' and Christ answered 
him, 'Get thee behind me, Satan: thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him 
only shalt thou serve.' For as he had deceived Adam, so he hoped that he might 
contrive some mischief against Christ also. Moreover, the statement, 'All my 
bones are poured out and dispersed like water; my heart has become like wax, 
melting in the midst of my belly,' was a prediction of that which happened to 
Him on that night when men came out against Him to the Mount of Olives to seize 
Him. For in the memoirs which I say were drawn up by His apostles and those who 
followed them, [it is recorded] that His sweat fell down like drops of blood 
while He was praying, and saying, 'If it be possible, let this cup pass:' His 
heart and also His bones trembling; His heart being like wax melting in His 
belly: in order that we may perceive that the Father wished His Son really to 
undergo such sufferings for our sakes, and may not say that He, being the Son of 
God, did not feel what was happening to Him and inflicted on Him. Further, the 
expression, 'My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue has cleaved 
to my throat,' was a prediction, as I previously remarked, of that silence, when 
He who convicted all your teachers of being unwise returned no answer at all. 
CHAPTER CIV -- CIRCUMSTANCES OF CHRIST'S DEATH ARE PREDICTED IN THIS BALM. 
"And the statement, 'Thou hast brought me into the dust of death; for many 
dogs have surrounded me: the assembly of the wicked have beset me round. They 
pierced my hands and my feet. They did tell all my bones. They did look and 
stare upon me. They parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my 
vesture,'--was a prediction, as I said before, of the death to which the 
synagogue of the wicked would condemn Him, whom He calls both dogs and hunters, 
declaring that those who hunted Him were both gathered together and assiduously 
striving to condemn Him. And this is recorded to have happened in the memoirs of 
His apostles. And I have shown that, after His crucifixion, they who crucified 
Him parted His garments among them. 
CHAPTER CV -- THE PSALM ALSO PREDICTS THE CRUCIFIXION AND THE SUBJECT OF THE 
LAST PRAYERS OF CHRIST ON EARTH. 
"And what follows of the Psalm,--'But Thou, Lord, do not remove Thine 
assistance from me; give heed to help me. Deliver my soul from the sword, and my 
only-begotten from the hand of the dog; save me from the lion's mouth, and my 
humility from the horns of the unicorns,'--was also information and prediction 
of the events which should befall Him. For I have already proved that He was the 
only-begotten of the Father of all things, being begotten in a peculiar manner 
Word and Power by Him, and having afterwards become man through the Virgin, as 
we have learned from the memoirs. Moreover, it is similarly foretold that He 
would die by crucifixion. For the passage, 'Deliver my soul from the sword, and 
my only-begotten from the hand of the dog; save me from the lion's mouth, and my 
humility from the horns of the unicorns,' is indicative of the suffering by 
which He should die, i.e., by crucifixion. For the 'horns of the, unicorns,' I 
have already explained to you, are the figure of the cross only. And the prayer 
that His soul should be saved from the sword, and lion's mouth, and hand of the 
dog, was a prayer that no one should take possession of His soul: so that, when 
we arrive at the end of life, we may ask the same petition from God, who is able 
to turn away every shameless evil angel from taking our souls. And that the 
souls survive, I have shown to you from the fact that the soul of Samuel was 
called up by the witch, as Saul demanded. And it appears also, that all the 
souls of similiar righteous men and prophets fell under the dominion of such 
powers, as is indeed to be inferred from the very facts in the case of that 
witch. Hence also God by His Son teaches us for whose sake these things seem to 
have been done, always to strive earnestly, and at death to pray that our souls 
may not fall into the hands of any such power. For when Christ was giving up His 
spirit on the cross, He said, 'Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit,' as I 
have learned also from the memoirs. For He exhorted His disciples to surpass the 
pharisaic way of living, with the warning, that if they did not, they might be 
sure they could not be saved; and these words are recorded in the memoirs: 
'Unless your righteousness exceed that of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall 
not enter into the kingdom of heaven.' 
CHAPTER CVI -- CHRIST'S RESURRECTION IS FORETOLD IN THE CONCLUSION OF THE 
PSALM. 
"The remainder of the Psalm makes it manifest that He knew His Father would 
grant to Him all things which He asked, and would raise Him from the dead; and 
that He urged all who fear God to praise Him because He had compassion on all 
races of believing men, through the mystery of Him who was crucified; and that 
He stood in the midst of His brethren the apostles (who repented of their flight 
from Him when He was crucified, after He rose from the dead, and after they were 
persuaded by Himself that, before His passion He had mentioned to them that He 
must suffer these things, and that they were announced beforehand by the 
prophets), and when living with them sang praises to God, as is made evident in 
the memoirs of the apostles. The words are the following: 'I will declare Thy 
name to my brethren; in the midst of the Church will I praise Thee. Ye that fear 
the Lord, praise Him; all ye, the seed of Jacob, glorify Him. Let all the seed 
of Israel fear Him.' And when it is said that He changed the name of one of the 
apostles to Peter; and when it is written in the memoirs of Him that this so 
happened, as well as that He changed the names of other two brothers, the sons 
of Zebedee, to Boanerges, which means sons of thunder; this was an announcement 
of the fact that it was He by whom Jacob was called Israel, and Oshea called 
Jesus (Joshua), under whose name the people who survived of those that came from 
Egypt were conducted into the land promised to the patriarchs. And that He 
should arise like a star from the seed of Abraham, Moses showed before hand when 
he thus said, 'A star shall arise from Jacob, and a leader from Israel;' and 
another Scripture says, 'Behold a man; the East is His name.' Accordingly, when 
a star rose in heaven at the time of His birth, as is recorded in the memoirs of 
His apostles, the Magi from Arabia, recognising the sign by this, came and 
worshipped Him. 
CHAPTER CVII -- THE SAME IS TAUGHT FROM THE HISTORY OF JONAH. 
"And that He would rise again on the third day after the crucifixion, it is 
written in the memoirs that some of your nation, questioning Him, said, 'Show us 
a sign;' and He replied to them, 'An evil and adulterous generation seeketh 
after a sign; and no sign shall be given them, save the sign of Jonah.' And 
since He spoke this obscurely, it was to be understood by the audience that 
after His crucifixion He should rise again on the third day. And He showed that 
your generation was more wicked and more adulterous than the city of Nineveh; 
for the latter, when Jonah preached to them, after he had been cast up on the 
third day from the belly of the great fish, that after three (in other versions, 
forty) days they should all perish, proclaimed a fast of all creatures, men and 
beasts, with sackcloth, and with earnest lamentation, with true repentance from 
the heart, and turning away from unrighteousness, in the belief that God is 
merciful and kind to all who turn from wickedness; so that the king of that city 
himself, with his nobles also, put on sackcloth and remained fasting and 
praying, and obtained their request that the city should not be overthrown. But 
when Jonah was grieved that on the (fortieth) third day, as he proclaimed, the 
city was not overthrown, by the dispensation of a gourd springing up from the 
earth for him, under which he sat and was shaded from the heat (now the gourd 
had sprung up suddenly, and Jonah had neither planted nor watered it, but it had 
come up all at once to afford him shade), and by the other dispensation of its 
withering away, for which Jonah grieved, [God] convicted him of being unjustly 
displeased because the city of Nineveh had not been overthrown, and said, 'Thou 
hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest 
it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night. And shall I not 
spare Nineveh, the great city, wherein dwell more than six score thousand 
persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and 
also much cattle?' 
CHAPTER CVII -- THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST DID NOT CONVERT THE JEWS. BUT 
THROUGH THE WHOLE WORLD THEY HAVE SENT MEN TO ACCUSE CHRIST. 
"And though all the men of your nation knew the incidents in the life of 
Jonah, and though Christ said amongst you that He would give the sign of Jonah, 
exhorting you to repent of your wicked deeds at least after He rose again from 
the dead, and to mourn before God as did the Ninevites, in order that your 
nation and city might not be taken and destroyed, as they have been destroyed; 
yet you not only have not repented, after you learned that He rose from the 
dead, but, as I said before you have sent chosen and ordained men throughout all 
the world to proclaim that a godless and lawless heresy had sprung from one 
Jesus, a Galilaean deceiver, whom we crucified, but his disciples stole him by 
night from the tomb, where he was laid when unfastened from the cross, and now 
deceive men by asserting that he has risen from the dead and ascended to heaven. 
Moreover, you accuse Him of having taught those godless, lawless, and unholy 
doctrines which you mention to the condemnation of those who confess Him to be 
Christ, and a Teacher from and Son of God. Besides this, even when your city is 
captured, and your land ravaged, you do not repent, but dare to utter 
imprecations on Him and all who believe in Him. Yet we do not hate you or those 
who, by your means, have conceived such prejudices against us; but we pray that 
even now all of you may repent and obtain mercy from God, the compassionate and 
long-suffering Father of all. 
CHAPTER CIX -- THE CONVERSION OF THE GENTILES HAS BEEN PREDICTED BY MICAH. 
"But that the Gentiles would repent of the evil in which they led erring 
lives, when they heard the doctrine preached by His apostles from Jerusalem, and 
which they learned through them, suffer me to show you by quoting a short 
statement from the prophecy of Micah, one of the twelve [minor prophets]. This 
is as follows: 'And in the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, 
established on the top of the mountains; it shall be exalted above the hills, 
arid people shall flow unto it. And many nations shall go, and say, Come, let us 
go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and 
they shall enlighten us in His way, and we shall walk in His paths: for out of 
Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He 
shall judge among many peoples, and shall rebuke strong nations afar off; and 
they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles: 
nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war 
any more. And each man shall sit under his vine and under his fig tree; and 
there shall be none to terrify: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken 
it. For all people will walk in the name of their gods; but we will walk in the 
name of the Lord our God for ever. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I 
will assemble her that is afflicted, and gather her that is driven out, and whom 
I had plagued; and I shall make her that is afflicted a remnant, and her that is 
oppressed a strong nation. And the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion from 
henceforth, and even for ever.' " 
CHAPTER CX -- A PORTION OF THE PROPHECY ALREADY FULFILLED IN THE CHRISTIANS: 
THE REST SHALL BE FULFILLED AT THE SECOND ADVENT. 
And when I had finished these words, I continued: "Now I am aware that your 
teachers, sirs, admit the whole of the words of this passage to refer to Christ; 
and I am likewise aware that they maintain He has not yet come; or if they say 
that He has come, they assert that it is not known who He is; but when He shall 
become manifest and glorious, then it shall be known who He is. And then, they 
say, the events mentioned in this passage shall happen, just as if there was no 
fruit as yet from the words of the prophecy. O unreasoning men! understanding 
not what has been proved by all these passages, that two advents of Christ have 
been announced: the one, in which He is set forth as suffering, inglorious, 
dishonoured, and crucified; but the other, in which He shall come from heaven 
with glory, when the man of apostasy, who speaks strange things against the Most 
High, shall venture to do unlawful deeds on the earth against us the Christians, 
who, having learned the true worship of God from the law, and the word which 
went forth from Jerusalem by means of the apostles of Jesus, have fled for 
safety to the God of Jacob and God of Israel; and we who were filled with war, 
and mutual slaughter, and every wickedness, have each through the whole earth 
changed our warlike weapons,--our swords into ploughshares, and our spears into 
implements of tillage,--and we cultivate piety, righteousness, philanthropy, 
faith, and hope, which we have from the Father Himself through Him who was 
crucified; and sitting each under his vine, i.e., each man possessing his own 
married wife. For you are aware that the prophetic word says, 'And his wife 
shall be like a fruitful vine.' Now it is evident that no one can terrify or 
subdue us who have believed in Jesus over all the world. For it is plain that, 
though beheaded, and crucified, and thrown to wild beasts, and chains, and fire, 
and all other kinds of torture, we do not give up our confession; but the more 
such things happen, the more do others and in larger numbers become faithful, 
and worshippers of God through the name of Jesus. For Just as if one should cut 
away the fruit-bearing parts of a vine, it grows up again, and yields other 
branches flourishing and fruitful; even so the same thing happens with us. For 
the vine planted by God and Christ the Saviour is His people. But the rest of 
the prophecy shall be fulfilled at His second coming. For the expression, 'He 
that is afflicted [and driven out],' i.e., from the world, [implies] that, so 
far as you and all other men have it in your power, each Christian has been 
driven out not only from his own property, but even from the whole world; for 
you permit no Christian to live. But you say that the same fate has befallen 
your own nation. Now, if you have been cast out after defeat in battle, you have 
suffered such treatment justly indeed, as all the Scriptures bear witness; but 
we, though we have done no such [evil acts] after we knew the truth of God, are 
testified to by God, that, together with the most righteous, and only spotless 
and sinless Christ, we are taken away out of the earth. For Isaiah cries, 
'Behold how the righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and righteous 
men are taken away, and no man considers it.' 
CHAPTER CXI -- THE TWO ADVENTS WERE SIGNIFIED BY THE TWO GOATS. OTHER FIGURES 
OF THE FIRST ADVENT, IN WHICH THE GENTILES ARE FREED BY THE BLOOD OF CHRIST. 
"And that it was declared by symbol, even in the time of Moses, that there 
would be two advents of this Christ, as I have mentioned previously, [is 
manifest] from the symbol of the goats presented for sacrifice during the fast. 
And again, by what Moses and Joshua did, the same thing was symbolically 
announced and told beforehand. For the one of them, stretching out his hands, 
remained till evening on the hill, his hands being supported; and this reveals a 
type of no other thing than of the cross: and the other, whose name was altered 
to Jesus (Joshua), led the fight, and Israel conquered. Now this took place in 
the case of both those holy men and prophets of God, that you may perceive how 
one of them could not bear up both the mysteries: I mean, the type of the cross 
and the type of the name. For this is, was, and shall be the strength of Him 
alone, whose name every power dreads, being very much tormented because they 
shall be destroyed by Him. Therefore our suffering and crucified Christ was not 
cursed by the law, but made it manifest that He alone would save those who do 
not depart from His faith. And the blood of the passover, sprinkled on each 
man's door-posts and lintel, delivered those who were saved in Egypt, when the 
first-born of the Egyptians were destroyed. For the passover was Christ, who was 
afterwards sacrificed, as also Isaiah said, 'He was led as a sheep to the 
slaughter.' And it is written, that on the day of the passover you seized Him, 
and that also during the passover you crucified Him. And as the blood of the 
passover saved those who were in Egypt, so also the blood of Christ will deliver 
from death those who have believed. Would God, then, have been deceived if this 
sign had not been above the doors? I do not say that; but I affirm that He 
announced beforehand the future salvation for the human race through the blood 
of Christ. For the sign of the scarlet thread, which the spies, sent to Jericho 
by Joshua, son of Nave (Nun), gave to Rahab the harlot, telling her to bind it 
to the window through which she let them down to escape from their enemies, also 
manifested the symbol of the blood of Christ, by which those who were at one 
time harlots and unrighteous persons out of all nations are saved, receiving 
remission of sins, and continuing no longer in sin. 
CHAPTER CXII -- THE JEWS EXPOUND THESE SIGNS JEJUNELY AND FEEBLY, AND TAKE UP 
THEIR ATTENTION ONLY WITH INSIGNIFICANT MATTERS. 
"But you, expounding these things in a low [and earthly] manner, impute much 
weakness to God, if you thus listen to them merely, and do not investigate the 
force of the words spoken. Since even Moses would in this way be considered a 
transgressor: for he enjoined that no likeness of anything in heaven, or on 
earth, or in the sea, be made; and then he himself made a brazen serpent and set 
it on a standard, and bade those who were bitten look at it: and they were saved 
when they looked at it. Will the serpent, then, which (I have already said) God 
had in the beginning cursed and cut off by the great sword, as Isaiah says, be 
understood as having preserved at that time the people? and shall we receive 
these things in the foolish acceptation of your teachers, and [regard] them not 
as signs? And shall we not rather refer the standard to the resemblance of the 
crucified Jesus, since also Moses by his outstretched hands, together with him 
who was named Jesus (Joshua), achieved a victory for your people? For in this 
way we shall cease to be at a loss about the things which the lawgiver did, when 
he, without forsaking God, persuaded the people to hope in a beast through which 
transgression and disobedience had their origin. And this was done and said by 
the blessed prophet with much intelligence and mystery; and there is nothing 
said or done by any one of the prophets, without exception, which one can justly 
reprehend, if he possess the knowledge which is in them. But if your teachers 
only expound to you why female cancels are spoken of in this passage, and are 
not in that; or why so many measures of fine flour and so many measures of oil 
[are used] in the offerings; and do so in a low and sordid manner, while they 
never venture either to speak of or to expound the points which are great and 
worthy of investigation, or command you to give no audience to us while we 
expound them, and to come not into conversation with us; will they not deserve 
to hear what our Lord Jesus Christ said to them: 'Whited sepulchres, which 
appear beautiful outward, and within are full of dead men's bones; which pay 
tithe of mint, and swallow a camel: ye blind guides!' If, then, you will not 
despise the doctrines of those who exalt themselves and wish to be called Rabbi, 
Rabbi, and come with such earnestness and intelligence to the words of prophecy 
as to suffer the same inflictions from your own people which the prophets 
themselves did, you cannot receive any advantage whatsoever from the prophetic 
writings. 
CHAPTER CXIII. --JOSHUA WAS A FIGURE OF CHRIST. 
"What I mean is this. Jesus (Joshua), as I have now frequently remarked, who 
was called Oshea, when he was sent to spy out the land of Canaan, was named by 
Moses Jesus (Joshua). Why he did this you neither ask, nor are at a loss about 
it, nor make strict inquiries. Therefore Christ has escaped your notice; and 
though you read, you understand not; and even now, though you hear that Jesus is 
our Christ, you consider not that the name was bestowed on Him not purposelessly 
nor by chance. But you make a theological discussion as to why one rho 
was added to Abraham's first name; and as to why one 'p' was added to Sarah's 
name, you use similar high-sounding disputations. But why do you not similarly 
investigate the reason why the name of Oshea the son of Nave (Nun), which his 
father gave him, was changed to Jesus (Joshua)? But since not only was his name 
altered, but he was also appointed successor to Moses, being the only one of his 
contemporaries who came out from Egypt, he led the surviving people into the 
Holy Land; and as he, not Moses, led the people into the Holy Land, and as he 
distributed it by lot to those who entered along with him, so also Jesus the 
Christ will turn again the dispersion of the people, and will distribute the 
good land to each one, though not in the same manner. For the former gave them a 
temporary inheritance, seeing he was neither Christ who is God, nor the Son of 
God; but the latter, after the holy resurrection, shall give us the eternal 
possession. The former, after he had been named Jesus (Joshua), and after he had 
received strength from. His Spirit, caused the sun to stand still. For I have 
proved that it was Jesus who appeared to and conversed with Moses, and Abraham, 
and all the other patriarchs without exception, ministering to the will of the 
Father; who also, I say, came to be born man by the Virgin Mary, and I lives for 
ever. For the latter is He after whom and by whom the Father will renew both the 
heaven and the earth; this is He who shall shine an eternal light in Jerusalem; 
this is he who is the king of Salem after the order of Melchizedek, and the 
eternal Priest of the Most High. The former is said to have circumcised the 
people a second time with knives of stone (which was a sign of this circumcision 
with which Jesus Christ Himself has circumcised us from the idols made of stone 
and of other materials), and to have collected together those who were 
circumcised from the uncircumcision, i.e., from the error of the world, in every 
place by the knives of stone, to wit, the words of our Lord Jesus. For I have 
shown that Christ was proclaimed by the prophets in parables a Stone and a Rock. 
Accordingly the knives of stone we shall take to mean His words, by means of 
which so many who were in error have been circumcised from uncircumcision with 
the circumcision of the heart, with which God by Jesus commanded those from that 
time to be circumcised who derived their circumcision from Abraham, saying that 
Jesus (Joshua) would circumcise a second time with knives of stone those who 
entered into that holy land. 
CHAPTER CXIV -- SOME RULES FOR DISCERNING WHAT IS SAID ABOUT CHRIST. THE 
CIRCUMCISION OF THE JEWS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH CHRISTIANS RECEIVE. 
"For the Holy Spirit sometimes brought about that something, which was the 
type of the future, should be done clearly; sometimes He uttered words about 
what was to take place, as if it was then taking place, or had taken place. And 
unless those who read perceive this art, they will not be able to follow the 
words of the prophets as they ought. For example's sake, I shall repeat some 
prophetic passages, that you may understand what I say. When He speaks by 
Isaiah, 'He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb before the 
shearer,' He speaks as if the suffering had already taken place. And when He 
says again, 'I have stretched out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying 
people;' and when He says, 'Lord, who hath believed our report?'--the words are 
spoken as if announcing events which had already come to pass. For I have shown 
that Christ is oftentimes called a Stone in parable, and in figurative speech 
Jacob and Israel. And again, when He says, 'I shall behold the heavens, the 
works of Thy fingers,' unless I understand His method of using words, I shall 
not understand intelligently, but just as your teachers suppose, fancying that 
the Father of all, the unbegotten God, has hands and feet, and fingers, and a 
soul, like a composite being; and they for this reason teach that it was the 
Father Himself who appeared to Abraham and to Jacob. Blessed therefore are we 
who have been circumcised the second time with knives of stone. For your first 
circumcision was and is performed by iron instruments, for you remain 
hard-hearted; but our circumcision, which is the second, having been instituted 
after yours, circumcises us from idolatry and from absolutely every kind of 
wickedness by sharp stones, i.e., by the words [preached] by the apostles of the 
corner-stone cut out without hands. And our hearts are thus circumcised from 
evil, so that we are happy to die for the name of the good Rock, which causes 
living water to burst forth for the hearts of those who by Him have loved the 
Father of all, and which gives those who are willing to drink of the water of 
life. But you do not comprehend me when I speak these things; for you have not 
understood what it has been prophesied that Christ would do, and you do not 
believe us who draw your attention to what has been written. For Jeremiah thus 
cries: 'Woe unto you! because you have forsaken the living fountain, and have 
digged for yourselves broken cisterns that can hold no water. Shall there be a 
wilderness where Mount Zion is, because I gave Jerusalem a bill of divorce in 
your sight?' 
CHAPTER CXV -- PREDICTION ABOUT THE CHRISTIANS IN ZECHARIAH. THE MALIGNANT 
WAY WHICH THE JEWS HAVE IN DISPUTATIONS. 
"But you ought to believe Zechariah when he shows in parable the mystery of 
Christ, and announces it obscurely. The following are his words: 'Rejoice, and 
be glad, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I shall dwell in the midst of 
thee, saith the Lord. And many nations shall be added to the Lord in that day. 
And they shall be my people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee; and they 
shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee. And the Lord shall 
inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and He shall choose Jerusalem again. 
Let all flesh fear before the Lord, for He is raised up out of His holy clouds. 
And He showed me Jesus (Joshua) the high priest standing before the angel [of 
the Lord]; and the devil stood at his right hand to resist him. And the Lord 
said to the devil, The Lord who hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee. Behold, is 
not this a brand plucked out of the fire?' " 
As Trypho was about to reply and contradict me, I said, "Wait and hear what I 
say first: for I am not to give the explanation which you suppose, as if there 
had been no priest of the name of Joshua (Jesus) in the land of Babylon, where 
your nation were prisoners. But even if I did, I have shown that if there was a 
priest named Joshua (Jesus) in your nation, yet the prophet had not seen him in 
his revelation, just as he had not seen either the devil or the angel of the 
Lord by eyesight, and in his waking condition, but in a trance, at the time when 
the revelation was made to him. But I now say, that as [Scripture] said that the 
Son of Nave (Nun) by the name Jesus (Joshua) wrought powerful works and exploits 
which proclaimed beforehand what would be performed by our Lord; so I proceed 
now to show that the revelation made among your people in Babylon in the days of 
Jesus (Joshua) the priest, was an announcement of the things to be accomplished 
by our Priest, who is God, and Christ the Son of God the Father of all. 
"Indeed, I wondered," continued I, "why a little ago you kept silence while I 
was speaking, and why you did not interrupt me when I said that the son of Nave 
(Nun) was the only one of contemporaries who came out of Egypt that entered the 
Holy Land along with the men described as younger than that generation. For you 
swarm and light on sores like flies. For though one should speak ten thousand 
words well, if there happen to be one little word displeasing to you, because 
not sufficiently intelligible or accurate, you make no account of the many good 
words, but lay hold of the little word, and are very zealous in setting it up as 
something impious and guilty; in order that, when you are judged with the very 
same judgment by God, you may have a much heavier account to render for your 
great audacities, whether evil actions, or bad interpretations which you obtain 
by falsifying the truth. For with what judgment you judge, it is righteous that 
you be judged withal. 
CHAPTER CXVI -- IT IS SHOWN HOW THIS PROPHECY SUITS THE CHRISTIANS. 
"But to give you the account of the revelation of the holy Jesus Christ, I 
take up again my discourse, and I assert that even that revelation was made for 
us who believe on Christ the High Priest, namely this crucified One; and though 
we lived in fornication and all kinds of filthy conversation, we have by the 
grace of our Jesus, according to His Father's will, stripped ourselves of all 
those filthy wickednesses with which we were imbued. And though the devil is 
ever at hand to resist us, and anxious to seduce all to himself, yet the Angel 
of God, i.e., the Power of God sent to us through Jesus Christ, rebukes him, and 
he departs from us. And we are just as if drawn out from the fire, when purified 
from our former sins, and [rescued] from the affliction and the fiery trial by 
which the devil and all his coadjutors try us; out of which Jesus the Son of God 
has promised again to deliver us, and invest us with prepared garments, if we do 
His commandments; and has undertaken to provide an eternal kingdom [for us]. For 
just as that Jesus (Joshua), called by the prophet a priest, evidently had on 
filthy garments because he is said to have taken a harlot for a wife, and is 
called a brand plucked out of the fire, because he had received remission of 
sins when the devil that resisted him was rebuked; even so we, who through the 
name of Jesus have believed as one man in God the Maker of all, have been 
stripped, through the name of His first-begotten Son, of the filthy garments, 
i.e., of our sins; and being vehemently inflamed by the word of His calling, we 
are the true high priestly race of God, as even God Himself bears witness, 
saying that in every place among the Gentiles sacrifices are presented to Him 
well-pleasing and pure. Now God receives sacrifices from no one, except through 
His priests. 
CHAPTER CXVII -- MALACHI'S PROPHECY CONCERNING THE SACRIFICES OF THE 
CHRISTIANS. IT CANNOT BE TAKEN AS REFERRING TO THE PRAYERS OF JEWS OF THE 
DISPERSION. 
"Accordingly, God, anticipating all the sacrifices which we offer through 
this name, and which Jesus the Christ enjoined us to offer, i.e., in the 
Eucharist of the bread and the cup, and which are presented by Christians in all 
places throughout the world, bears witness that they are well-pleasing to Him. 
But He utterly rejects those presented by you and by those priests of yours, 
saying, 'And I will not accept your sacrifices at your hands; for from the 
rising of the sun to its setting my name is glorified among the Gentiles (He 
says); but ye profane it.' Yet even now, in your love of contention, you assert 
that God does not accept the sacrifices of those who dwelt then in Jerusalem, 
and were called Israelites; but says that He is pleased with the prayers of the 
individuals of that nation then dispersed, and calls their prayers sacrifices. 
Now, that prayers and giving of thanks, when offered by worthy men, are the only 
perfect and well-pleasing sacrifices to God, I also admit. For such alone 
Christians have undertaken to offer, and in the remembrance effected by their 
solid and liquid food, whereby the suffering of the Son of God which He endured 
is brought to mind, whose name the high priests of your nation and your teachers 
have caused to be profaned and blasphemed over all the earth. But these filthy 
garments, which have been put by you on all who have become Christians by the 
name of Jesus, God shows shall be taken away from us, when He shall raise all 
men from the dead, and appoint some to be incorruptible, immortal, and free from 
sorrow in the everlasting and imperishable kingdom; but shall send others away 
to the everlasting punishment of fire. But as to you and your teachers deceiving 
yourselves when you interpret what the Scripture says as referring to those of 
your nation then in dispersion, and maintain that their prayers and sacrifices 
offered in every place are pure and well-pleasing, learn that you are speaking 
falsely, and trying by all means to cheat yourselves: for, first of all, not 
even now does your nation extend from the rising to the setting of the sun, but 
there are nations among which none of your race ever dwelt. For there is not one 
single race of men, whether barbarians, or Greeks, or whatever they may be 
called, nomads, or vagrants, or herdsmen living in tents, among whom prayers and 
giving of thanks are not offered through the name of the crucified Jesus. And 
then, as the Scriptures show, at the time when Malachi wrote this, your 
dispersion over all the earth, which now exists, had not taken place. 
CHAPTER CXVIII -- -HE EXHORTS TO REPENTANCE BEFORE CHRIST COMES; IN WHOM 
CHRISTIANS, SINCE THEY BELIEVE, ARE FAR MORE RELIGIOUS THAN JEWS. 
"So that you ought rather to desist from the love of strife, and repent 
before the great day of judgment come, wherein all those of your tribes who have 
pierced this Christ shall mourn as I have shown has been declared by the 
Scriptures. And I have explained that the Lord swore, 'after the order of 
Melchizedek,' and what this prediction means; and the prophecy of Isaiah which 
says, 'His burial is taken away from the midst,' I have already said, referred 
to the future burying and rising again of Christ; and I have frequently remarked 
that this very Christ is the Judge of all the living and the dead. And Nathan 
likewise, speaking to David about Him, thus continued: 'I will be His Father, 
and He shall be my Son; and my mercy shall I not take away from Him, as I did 
from them that went before Him; and I will establish Him in my house, and in His 
kingdom for ever.' And Ezekiel says, 'There shall be no other prince in the 
house but He.' For He is the chosen Priest and eternal King, the Christ, 
inasmuch as He is the Son of God; and do not suppose that Isaiah or the other 
prophets speak of sacrifices of blood or libations being presented at the altar 
on His second advent, but of true and spiritual praises and giving of thanks. 
And we have not in vain believed in Him, and have not been led astray by those 
who taught us such doctrines; but this has come to pass through the wonderful 
foreknowledge of God, in order that we, through the calling of the new and 
eternal covenant, that is, of Christ, might be found more intelligent and 
God-fearing than yourselves, who are considered to be lovers of God and men of 
understanding, but are not. Isaiah, filled with admiration of this, said: 'And 
kings shall shut their mouths: for those to whom no announcement has been made 
in regard to Him shall see; and those who heard not shall understand. Lord, who 
hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?' 
"And in repeating this, Trypho," I continued, "as far as is allowable, I 
endeavour to do so for the sake of those who came with you to-day, yet briefly 
and concisely." 
Then he replied, "You do well; and though you repeat the same things at 
considerable length, be assured that I and my companions listen with I pleasure 
." 
CHAPTER CXIX -- CHRISTIANS ARE THE HOLY PEOPLE PROMISED TO ABRAHAM. THEY HAVE 
BEEN CALLED LIKE ABRAHAM. 
Then I said again, "Would you suppose, sirs, that we could ever have 
understood these matters in the Scriptures, if we had not received grace to 
discern by the will of Him whose pleasure it was? in order that the saying of 
Moses might come to pass, 'They provoked me with strange [gods], they provoked 
me to anger with their abominations. They sacrificed to demons whom they knew 
not; new gods that came newly up, whom their fathers knew not. Thou hast 
forsaken God that begat thee, and forgotten God that brought thee up. And the 
Lord saw, and was jealous, and was provoked to anger by reason of the rage of 
His sons and daughters: and He said, I will turn My face away from them, and I 
will show what shall come on them at the last; for it is a very froward 
generation, children in whom is no faith. They have moved Me to jealousy with 
that which is not God, they have provoked Me to anger with their idols; and I 
will move them to jealousy with that which is not a nation, I will provoke them 
to anger with a foolish people. For a fire is kindled from Mine anger, and it 
shall burn to Hades. It shall consume the earth and her increase, and set on 
fire the foundations of the mountains; I will heap mischief on them.' And after 
that Righteous One was put to death, we flourished as another people, and shot 
forth as new and prosperous corn; as the prophets said, 'And many nations shall 
betake themselves to the Lord in that day for a people: and they shall dwell in 
the midst of all the earth.' But we are not only a people, but also a holy 
people, as we have shown already. 'And they shall call them the holy people, 
redeemed by the Lord.' Therefore we are not a people to be despised, nor a 
barbarous race, nor such as the Carian and Phrygian nations; but God has even 
chosen us and He has become manifest to those who asked not after Him. 'Behold, 
I am God,' He says, 'to the nation which called not on My name.' For this is 
that nation which God of old promised to Abraham, when He declared that He would 
make him a father of many nations; not meaning, however, the Arabians, or 
Egyptians, or Idumaeans, since Ishmael became the father of a mighty nation, and 
so did Esau; and there is now a great multitude of Ammonites. Noah, moreover, 
was the father of Abraham, and in fact of all men; and others were the 
progenitors of others. What larger measure of grace, then, did Christ bestow on 
Abraham? This, namely, that He called him with His voice by the like calling, 
telling him to quit the land wherein he dwelt. And He has called all of us by 
that voice, and we have left already the way of living in which we used to spend 
our days, passing our time in evil after the fashions of the other inhabitants 
of the earth; and along with Abraham we shall inherit the holy land, when we 
shall receive the inheritance for an endless eternity, being children of Abraham 
through the like faith. For as he believed the voice of God, and it was imputed 
to him for righteousness, in like manner we having believed God's voice spoken 
by the apostles of Christ, and promulgated to us by the prophets, have renounced 
even to death all the things of the world. Accordingly, He promises to him a 
nation of similar faith, God-fearing, righteous, and delighting the Father; but 
it is not you, 'in whom is no faith.' 
CHAPTER CXX. -- CHRISTIANS WERE PROMISED TO ISAAC, JACOB, AND JUDAH. 
"Observe, too, how the same promises are made to Isaac and to Jacob. For thus 
He speaks to Isaac: 'And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be 
blessed.' And to Jacob: 'And in thee and in thy seed shall all families of the 
earth be blessed.' He says that neither to Esau nor to Reuben, nor to any other; 
only to those of whom the Christ should arise, according to the dispensation, 
through the Virgin Mary. But if you would consider the blessing of Judah, you 
would perceive what I say. For the seed is divided from Jacob, and comes down 
through Judah, and Phares, and Jesse, and David. And this was a symbol of the 
fact that some of your nation would be found children of Abraham, and found, 
too, in the lot of Christ; but that others, who are indeed children of Abraham, 
would be like the sand on the sea-shore, barren and fruitless, much in quantity, 
and without number indeed, but bearing no fruit whatever, and only drinking the 
water of the sea. And a vast multitude in your nation are convicted of being of 
this kind, imbibing doctrines of bitterness and godlessness, but spurning the 
word of God. He speaks therefore in the passage relating to Judah: 'A prince 
shall not fail from Judah, nor a ruler from his thighs, till that which is laid 
up for him come; and He shall be the expectation of the nations.' And it is 
plain that this was spoken not of Judah, but of Christ. For all we out of all 
nations do expect not Judah, but Jesus, who led your fathers out of Egypt. For 
the prophecy referred even to the advent of Christ: 'Till He come for whom this 
is laid up, and He shall be the expectation of nations.' Jesus came, therefore, 
as we have shown at length, and is expected again to appear above the clouds; 
whose name you profane, and labour hard to get it profaned over all the earth. 
It were possible for me, sirs," I continued, "to contend against you about the 
reading which you so interpret, saying it is written, 'Till the things laid up 
for Him come;' though the Seventy have not so explained it, but thus, 'Till He 
comes for whom this is laid up.' But since what follows indicates that the 
reference is to Christ (for it is, 'and He shall be the expectation of 
nations'), I do not proceed to have a mere verbal controversy with you, as I 
have not attempted to establish proof about Christ from the passages of 
Scripture which are not admitted by you? which I quoted from the words of 
Jeremiah the prophet, and Esdras, and David; but from those which are even now 
admitted by you, which had your teachers comprehended, be well assured they 
would have deleted them, as they did those about the death of Isaiah, whom you 
sawed asunder with a wooden saw. And this was a mysterious type of Christ being 
about to cut your nation in two, and to raise those worthy of the honour to the 
everlasting kingdom along with the holy patriarchs and prophets; but He has said 
that He will send others to the condemnation of the unquenchable fire along with 
similar disobedient and impenitent men from all the nations. 'For they shall 
come,' He said, 'from the west and from the east, and shall sit down with 
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; but the children of the 
kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.' And I have mentioned these 
things, taking nothing whatever into consideration, except the speaking of the 
truth, and refusing to be coerced by any one, even though I should be forthwith 
torn in pieces by you. For I gave no thought to any of my people, that is, the 
Samaritans, when I had a communication in writing with Caesar, but stated that 
they were wrong in trusting to the magician Simon of their own nation, who, they 
say, is God above all power, and authority, and might." 
CHAPTER CXXI -- FROM THE FACT THAT THE GENTILES BELIEVE LN JESUS, IT IS 
EVIDENT THAT HE IS CHRIST. 
And as they kept silence, I went on: "[The Scripture], speaking by David 
about this Christ, my friends, said no longer that 'in His seed' the nations 
should be blessed, but 'in Him.' So it is here: 'His name shall rise up for ever 
above the sun; and in Him shall all nations be blessed.' But if all nations are 
blessed in Christ, and we of all nations believe in Him, then He is indeed the 
Christ, and we are those blessed by Him. God formerly gave the sun as an object 
of worship, as it is written, but no one ever was seen to endure death on 
account of his faith in the sun; but for the name of Jesus you may see men of 
every nation who have endured and do endure all sufferings, rather than deny 
Him. For the word of His truth and wisdom is more ardent and more light-giving 
than the rays of the sun, and sinks down into the depths of heart and mind. 
Hence also the Scripture said, 'His name shall rise up above the sun.' And 
again, Zechariah says, 'His name is the East.' And speaking of the same, he says 
that 'each tribe shall mourn.' But if He so shone forth and was so mighty in His 
first advent (which was without honour and comeliness, and very contemptible), 
that in no nation He is unknown, and everywhere men have repented of the old 
wickedness in each nation's way of living, so that even demons were subject to 
His name, and all powers and kingdoms feared His name more than they feared all 
the dead, shall He not on His glorious advent destroy by all means all those who 
hated Him, and who unrighteously departed from Him, but give rest to His own, 
rewarding them with all they have looked for? To us, therefore, it has been 
granted to hear, and to understand, and to be saved by this Christ, and to 
recognise all the [truths revealed] by the Father. Wherefore He said to Him: 'It 
is a great thing for Thee to be called my servant, to raise up the tribes of 
Jacob, and turn again the dispersed of Israel. I have appointed Thee for a light 
to the Gentiles, that Thou mayest be their salvation unto the end of the earth.' 

CHAPTER CXXII -- THE JEWS UNDERSTAND THIS OF THE PROSELYTES WITHOUT REASON. 
"You think that these words refer to the stranger and the proselytes, but in 
fact they refer to us who have been illumined by Jesus. For Christ would have 
borne witness even to them; but now you are become twofold more the children of 
hell, as He said Himself. Therefore what was written by the prophets was spoken 
not of those persons, but of us, concerning whom the Scripture speaks: 'I will 
lead the blind by a way which they knew not; and they shall walk in paths which 
they have not known. And I am witness, saith the Lord God, and my servant whom I 
have chosen.' To whom, then, does Christ bear witness? Manifestly to those who 
have believed. But the proselytes not only do not believe, but twofold more than 
yourselves blaspheme His name, and wish to torture and put to death us who 
believe in Him; for in all points they strive to be like you. And again in other 
words He cries: 'I the Lord have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold 
Thine hand, and will strengthen Thee, and will give Thee for a covenant of the 
people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out 
the prisoners from their bonds.' These words, indeed, sirs, refer also to 
Christ, and concern the enlightened nations; or will you say again, He speaks to 
them of the law and the proselytes?" 
Then some of those who had come on the second day cried out as if they had 
been in a theatre, "But what? does He not refer to the law, and to those 
illumined by it? Now these are proselytes." 
"No," I said, looking towards Trypho, "since, if the law were able to 
enlighten the nations and those who possess it, what need is there of a new 
covenant? But since God announced beforehand that He would send a new covenant, 
and an everlasting law and commandment, we will not understand this of the old 
law and its proselytes, but of Christ and His proselytes, namely us Gentiles, 
whom He has illumined, as He says somewhere: 'Thus saith the Lord, In an 
acceptable time have I heard Thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped Thee, 
and I have given Thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, and 
to inherit the deserted.' What, then, is Christ's inheritance? Is it not the 
nations? What is the covenant of God? Is it not Christ? As He says in another 
place: 'Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of Me, and I shall 
give Thee the nations for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the 
earth for Thy possession.' 
CHAPTER CXXIII -- RIDICULOUS INTERPRETATIONS OF THE JEWS. CHRISTIANS ARE THE 
TRUE ISRAEL. 
"As, therefore, all these latter prophecies refer to Christ and the nations, 
you should believe that the former refer to Him and them in like manner. For the 
proselytes have no need of a covenant, if, since there is one and the same law 
imposed on all that are circumcised, the Scripture speaks about them thus: 'And 
the stranger shall also be joined with them, and shall be joined to the house of 
Jacob;' and because the proselyte, who is circumcised that he may have access to 
the people, becomes like one of themselves, while we who have been deemed worthy 
to be called a people are yet Gentiles, because we have not been circumcised. 
Besides, it is ridiculous for you to imagine that the eyes of the proselytes are 
to be opened while your own are not, and that you be understood as blind and 
deaf while they are enlightened. And it will be still more ridiculous for you, 
if you say that the law has been given to the nations, but you have not known 
it. For you would have stood in awe of God's wrath, and would not have been 
lawless, wandering sons; being much afraid of hearing God always say, 'Children 
in whom is no faith. And who are blind, but my servants? and deaf, but they that 
rule over them? And the servants of God have been made blind. You see often, but 
have not observed; your ears have been opened, and you have not heard.' Is God's 
commendation of you honourable? and is God's testimony seemly for His servants? 
You are not ashamed though you often hear these words. You do not tremble at 
God's threats, for you are a people foolish and hard-hearted. 'Therefore, 
behold, I will proceed to remove this people,' saith the Lord;' and I will 
remove them, and destroy the wisdom of the wise, and hide the understanding of 
the prudent.' Deservedly too: for you are neither wise nor prudent, but crafty 
and unscrupulous; wise only to do evil, but utterly incompetent to know the 
hidden counsel of God, or the faithful covenant of the Lord, or to find out the 
everlasting paths. 'Therefore, saith the Lord, I will raise up to Israel and to 
Judah the seed of men and the seed of beasts.' And by Isaiah He speaks thus 
concerning another Israel: 'In that day shall there be a third Israel among the 
Assyrians and the Egyptians, blessed in the land which the Lord of Sabaoth hath 
blessed, saying, blessed shall my people in Egypt and in Assyria be, and Israel 
mine inheritance.' Since then God blesses this people, and calls them Israel, 
and declares them to be His inheritance, how is it that you repent not of the 
deception you practise on yourselves, as if you alone were the Israel, and of 
execrating the people whom God has blessed? For when He speaks to Jerusalem and 
its environs, He thus added: 'And I will beget men upon you, even my people 
Israel; and they shall inherit you, and you shall be a possession for them; and 
you shall be no longer bereaved of them.'" 
"What, then?" says Trypho; "are you Israel? and speaks He such things of 
you?" 
"If, indeed," I replied to him, "we had not entered into a lengthy discussion 
on these topics, I might have doubted whether you ask this question in 
ignorance; but since we have brought the matter to a conclusion by demonstration 
and with your assent, I do not believe that you are ignorant of what I have just 
said, or desire again mere contention, but that you are urging me to exhibit the 
same proof to these men." And in compliance with the assent expressed in his 
eyes, I continued: "Again in Isaiah, if you have ears to hear it, God, speaking 
of Christ in parable, calls Him Jacob and Israel. He speaks thus: 'Jacob is my 
servant, I will uphold Him; Israel is mine elect, I will put my Spirit upon Him, 
and He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive, nor cry, 
neither shall any one hear His voice in the street: a bruised reed He shall not 
break, and smoking flax He shall not quench; but He shall bring forth judgment 
to truth: He shall shine, and shall not be broken till He have set judgment on 
the earth. And in His name shall the Gentiles trust.' As therefore from the one 
man Jacob, who was surnamed Israel, all your nation has been called Jacob and 
Israel; so we from Christ, who begat us unto God, like Jacob, and Israel, and 
Judah, and Joseph, and David, are called and are the true sons of God, and keep 
the commandments of Christ." 
CHAPTER CXXIV -- CHRISTIANS ARE THE SONS OF GOD. 
And when I saw that they were perturbed because I said that we are the sons 
of God, I anticipated their questioning, and said, "Listen, sirs, how the Holy 
Ghost speaks of this people, saying that they are all sons of the Highest; and 
how this very Christ will be present in their assembly, rendering judgment to 
all men. The words are spoken by David, and are, according to your version of 
them, thus: 'God standeth in the congregation of gods; He judgeth among the 
gods. How long do ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Judge 
for the orphan and the poor, and do justice to the humble and needy. Deliver the 
needy, and save the poor out of the hand of the wicked. They know not, neither 
have they understood; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth 
shall be shaken. I said, Ye are gods, and are all children of the Most High. But 
ye die like men, and fall like one of the princes. Arise, O God! judge the 
earth, for Thou shalt inherit all nations.' But in the version of the Seventy it 
is written, 'Behold, ye die like men, and fall like one of the princes, in order 
to manifest the disobedience of men,--I mean of Adam and Eve,--and the fall of 
one of the princes, i.e., of him who was called the serpent, who fell with a 
great overthrow, because he deceived Eve. But as my discourse is not intended to 
touch on this point, but to prove to you that the Holy Ghost reproaches men 
because they were made like God, free from suffering and death, provided that 
they kept His commandments, and were deemed deserving of the name of His sons, 
and yet they, becoming like Adam and Eve, work out death for themselves; let the 
interpretation of the Psalm be held just as you wish, yet thereby it is 
demonstrated that all men are deemed worthy of becoming "gods," and of having 
power to become sons of the Highest; and shall be each by himself judged and 
condemned like Adam and Eve. Now I have proved at length that Christ is called 
God. 
CHAPTER CXXV -- HE EXPLAINS WHAT FORCE THE WORD ISRAEL HAS, AND HOW IT SUITS 
CHRIST. 
"I wish, sirs," I said, "to learn from you what is the force of the name 
Israel." And as they were silent, I continued: "I shall tell you what I know: 
for I do not think it fight, when I know, not to speak; or, suspecting that you 
do know, and yet from envy or from voluntary ignorance deceive yourselves, to be 
continually solicitous; but I speak all things simply and candidly, as my Lord 
said: 'A sower went forth to sow the seed; and some fell by the wayside; and 
some among thorns, and some on stony ground, and some on good ground.' I must 
speak, then, in the hope of finding good ground somewhere; since that Lord of 
mine, as One strong and powerful, comes to demand back His own from all, land 
will not condemn His steward if He recognises that he, by the knowledge that the 
Lord is powerful and has come to demand His own, has given it to every bank, and 
has not digged for any cause whatsoever. Accordingly the name Israel signifies 
this, A man who overcomes power; for Isra is a man overcoming, and El is power. 
And that Christ would act so when He became man was foretold by the mystery of 
Jacob's wrestling with Him who appeared to him, in that He ministered to the 
will of the Father, yet nevertheless is God, in that He is the first-begotten of 
all creatures. For when He became man, as I previously remarked, the devil came 
to Him--i.e., that power which is called the serpent and Sa-tan--tempting Him, 
and striving to effect His downfall by asking Him to worship him. But He 
destroyed and overthrew the devil, having proved him to be wicked, in that he 
asked to be worshipper as God, contrary to the Scripture; who is an apostate 
from the will of God. For He answers him, 'It is written, Thou shalt worship the 
Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.' Then, overcome and convicted, the 
devil departed at that time. But since our Christ was to be numbed, i.e., by 
pain and experience of suffering, He made a previous intimation of this by 
touching Jacob's thigh, and causing it to shrink. But Israel was His name from 
the beginning, to which He altered the name of the blessed Jacob when He blessed 
him with His own name, proclaiming thereby that all who through Him have fled 
for refuge to the Father, constitute the blessed Israel. But you, having 
understood none of this, and not being prepared to understand, since you are the 
children of Jacob after the fleshly seed, expect that you shall be assuredly 
saved. But that you deceive yourselves in such matters, I have proved by many 
words. 
CHAPTER CXXVI -- THE VARIOUS NAMES OF CHRIST ACCORDING TO BOTH NATURES. IT IS 
SHOWN THAT HE IS GOD, AND APPEARED TO THE PATRIARCHS. 
"But if you knew, Trypho," continued I, "who He is that is called at one time 
the Angel of great counsel, and a Man by Ezekiel, and like the Son of man by 
Daniel, and a Child by Isaiah, and Christ and God to be worshipped by David, and 
Christ and a Stone by many, and Wisdom by Solomon, and Joseph and Judah and a 
Star by Moses, and the East by Zechariah, and the Suffering One and Jacob and 
Israel by Isaiah again, and a Rod, and Flower, and Corner-Stone, and Son of God, 
you would not have blasphemer Him who has now come, and been born, and suffered, 
and ascended to heaven; who shall also come again, and then your twelve tribes 
shall mourn. For if you had understood what has been written by the prophets, 
you would not have denied that He was God, Son of the only, unbegotten, 
unutterable God. For Moses says somewhere in Exodus the following: 'The Lord 
spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am the Lord, and I appeared to Abraham, to 
Isaac, and to Jacob, being their God; and my name I revealed not to them, and I 
established my covenant with them.' And thus again he says, 'A man wrestled with 
Jacob,' and asserts it was God; narrating that Jacob said, 'I have seen God face 
to face, and my life is preserved.' And it is recorded that he called the place 
where He wrestled with him, appeared to and blessed him, the Face of God 
(Peniel). And Moses says that God appeared also to Abraham near the oak in 
Mature, when he was sitting at the door of his tent at mid-day. Then he goes on 
to say: 'And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, three men stood 
before him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them.' a After a little, one of 
them promises a son to Abraham: 'Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall. I of 
a surety bear a child, and I am old? Is anything impossible with God? At the 
time appointed I will return, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall 
have a son. And they went away from Abraham.' Again he speaks of them thus: 'And 
the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom.' Then to Abraham He who 
was and is again speaks: 'I will not hide from Abraham, my servant, what I 
intend to do.'" And what follows in the writings of Moses I quoted and 
explained; "from which I have demonstrated," I said, "that He who is described 
as God appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and the other patriarchs, 
was appointed under the authority of the Father and Lord, and ministers to His 
will." Then I went on to say what I had not said before: "And so, when the 
people desired to eat flesh, and Moses had lost faith in Him, who also there is 
called the Angel, and who promised that God would give them to satiety, He who 
is both God and the Angel, sent by the Father, is described as saying and doing 
these things. For thus the Scripture says: 'And the Lord said to Moses Will the 
Lord's hand not be sufficient? thou shall know now whether my word shall conceal 
thee or not.' And again, in other words, it thus says: 'But the Lord spoke unto 
me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan: the Lord thy God, who goeth before thy 
face, He shall cut off the nations.' 
CHAPTER CXXVII -- THESE PASSAGES OF SCRIPTURE DO NOT APPLY TO THE FATHER, BUT 
TO THE WORD. 
"These and other such sayings are recorded by the lawgiver and by the 
prophets; and I suppose that I have stated sufficiently, that wherever God says, 
'God went up from Abraham,' or, 'The Lord spake to Moses,' and 'The Lord came 
down to behold the tower which the sons of men had built,' or when 'God shut 
Noah into the ark,' you must not imagine that the unbegotten God Himself came 
down or went up from any place. For the ineffable Father and Lord of all neither 
has come to any place, nor walks, nor sleeps, nor rises up, but remains in His 
own place, wherever that is, quick to behold and quick to hear, having neither 
eyes nor ears, but being of indescribable might; and He sees all things, and 
knows all things, and none of us escapes His observation; and He is not moved or 
confined to a spot in the whole world, for He existed before the world was made. 
How, then, could He talk with any one, or be seen by any one, or appear on the 
smallest portion of the earth, when the people at Sinai were not able to look 
even on the glory of Him who was sent from Him; and Moses himself could not 
enter into the tabernacle which he had erected, when it was filled with the 
glory of God; and the priest could not endure to stand before the temple when 
Solomon conveyed the ark into the house in Jerusalem which he had built for it? 
Therefore neither Abraham, nor Isaac, nor Jacob, nor any other man, saw the 
Father and ineffable Lord of all, and also of Christ, but [saw] Him who was 
according to His will His Son, being God, and the Angel because He ministered to 
His will; whom also it pleased Him to be born man by the Virgin; who also was 
fire when He conversed with Moses from the bush. Since, unless we thus 
comprehend the Scriptures, it must follow that the Father and Lord of all had 
not been in heaven when what Moses wrote took place: 'And the Lord rained upon 
Sodom fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven;' and again, when it is 
thus said by David: 'Lift up your gates, ye rulers; and be ye lift up, ye 
everlasting gates; and the King of glory shall enter;' and again, when He says: 
'The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy 
footstool.' 
CHAPTER CXXVIII -- THE WORD IS SENT NOT AS AN INANIMATE POWER, BUT AS A 
PERSON BEGOTTEN OF THE FATHER'S SUBSTANCE. 
"And that Christ being Lord, and God the Son of God, and appearing formerly 
in power as Man, and Angel, and in the glory of fire as at the bush, so also was 
manifested at the judgment executed on Sodom, has been demonstrated fully by 
what has been said." Then I repeated once more all that I had previously quoted 
from Exodus, about the vision in the bush, and the naming of Joshua (Jesus), and 
continued: "And do not suppose, sirs, that I am speaking superfluously when I 
repeat these words frequently: but it is because I know that some wish to 
anticipate these remarks, and to say that the power sent from the Father of all 
which appeared to Moses, or to Abraham, or to Jacob, is called an Angel because 
He came to men (for by Him the commands of the Father have been proclaimed to 
men); is called Glory, because He appears in a vision sometimes that cannot be 
borne; is called a Man, and a human being, because He appears strayed in such 
forms as the Father pleases; and they call Him the Word, because He carries 
tidings from the Father to men: but maintain that this power is indivisible and 
inseparable from the Father, just as they say that the light of the sun on earth 
is indivisible and inseparable from the sun in the heavens; as when it sinks, 
the light sinks along with it; so the Father, when He chooses, say they, causes 
His power to spring forth, and when He chooses, He makes it return to Himself. 
In this way, they teach, He made the angels. But it is proved that there are 
angels who always exist, and are never reduced to that form out of which they 
sprang. And that this power which the prophetic word calls God, as has been also 
amply demonstrated, and Angel, is not numbered [as different] in name only like 
the light of the sun but is indeed something numerically distinct, I have 
discussed briefly in what has gone before; when I asserted that this power was 
begotten from the Father, by His power and will, but not by abscission, as if 
the essence of the Father were divided; as all other things partitioned and 
divided are not the same after as before they were divided: and, for the sake of 
example, I took the case of fires kindled from a fire, which we see to be 
distinct from it, and yet that from which many can be kindled is by no means 
made less, but remains the same. 
CHAPTER CXXIX -- THAT IS CONFIRMED FROM OTHER PASSAGES OF SCRIPTURE. 
"And now I shall again recite the words which I have spoken in proof of this 
point. When Scripture says,' The Lord rained fire from the Lord out of heaven,' 
the prophetic word indicates that there were two in number: One upon the earth, 
who, it says, descended to behold the cry of Sodom; Another in heaven, who also 
is Lord of the Lord on earth, as He is Father and God; the cause of His power 
and of His being Lord and God. Again, when the Scripture records that God said 
in the beginning, 'Behold, Adam has become like one of Us,' this phrase, 'like 
one of Us,' is also indicative of number; and the words do not admit of a 
figurative meaning, as the sophists endeavour to affix on them, who are able 
neither to tell nor to understand the truth. And it is written in the book of 
Wisdom: 'If I should tell you daily events, I would be mindful to enumerate them 
from the beginning. The Lord created me the beginning of His ways for His works. 
From everlasting He established me in the beginning, before He formed the earth, 
and before He made the depths, and before the springs of waters came forth, 
before the mountains were settled; He begets me before all the hills.'" When I 
repeated these words, I added: "You perceive, my hearers, if you bestow 
attention, that the Scripture has declared that this Offspring was begotten by 
the Father before all things created; and that which is begotten is numerically 
distinct from that which begets, any one will admit." 
CHAPTER CXXX -- HE RETURNS TO THE CONVERSION OF THE GENTILES, AND SHOWS THAT 
IT WAS FORETOLD. 
And when all had given assent, I said: "I would now adduce some passages 
which I had not recounted before. They are recorded by the faithful servant 
Moses in parable, and are as follows: 'Rejoice, O ye heavens, with Him, and let 
all the angels of God worship Him;'" and I added what follows of the passage: 
"'Rejoice, O ye nations, with His people, and let all the angels of God be 
strengthened in Him: for the blood of His sons He avenges, and will avenge, and 
will recompense His enemies with vengeance, and will recompense those that hate 
Him; and the Lord will purify the land of His people.' And by these words He 
declares that we, the nations, rejoice with His people,--to wit, Abraham, and 
Isaac, and Jacob, and the prophets, and, in short, all of that people who are 
well-pleasing to God, according to what has been already agreed on between us. 
But we will not receive it of all your nation; since we know from Isaiah that 
the members of those who have transgressed shall be consumed by the worm and 
unquenchable fire, remaining immortal; so that they become a spectacle to all 
flesh. But in addition to these, I wish, sin," said I, "to add some other 
passages from the very words of Moses, from which you may understand that God 
has from of old dispersed all men according to their kindreds and tongues; and 
out of all kindreds has taken to Himself your kindred, a useless, disobedient, 
and faithless generation; and has shown that those who were selected out of 
every nation have obeyed His will through Christ,--whom He calls also Jacob, and 
names Israel,--and these, then, as I mentioned fully previously, must be Jacob 
and Israel. For when He says, 'Rejoice, O ye nations, with His people,' He 
allots the same inheritance to them, and does not call them by the same name; 
but when He says that they as Gentiles rejoice with His people, He calls them 
Gentiles to reproach you. For even as you provoked Him to anger by your 
idolatry, so also He has deemed those who were idolaters worthy of knowing His 
will, and of inheriting His inheritance. 
CHAPTER CXXXI -- HOW MUCH MORE FAITHFUL TO GOD THE GENTILES ARE WHO ARE 
CONVERTED TO CHRIST THAN THE JEWS. 
"But I shall quote the passage by which it is made known that God divided all 
the nations. It is as follows: 'Ask thy father, and he will show thee; thine 
eiders, and they will tell thee; when the Most High divided the nations, as He 
dispersed the sons of Adam. He set the bounds of the nations according to the 
numbers of the children of Israel; and the Lord's portion became His people 
Jacob, and Israel was the lot of His inheritance.'" And having said this, I 
added: "The Seventy have translated it, 'He set the bounds of the nations 
according to the number of the angels of God.' But because my argument is again 
in nowise weakened by this, I have adopted your exposition. And you yourselves, 
if you will confess the truth, must acknowledge that we, who have been called by 
God through the despised and shameful mystery of the cross (for the confession 
of which, and obedience to which, and for our piety, punishments even to death 
have been inflicted on us by demons, and by the host of the devil, through the 
aid ministered to them by you), and endure all torments rather than deny Christ 
even by word, through whom we are called to the salvation prepared beforehand by 
the Father, are more faithful to God than you, who were redeemed from Egypt with 
a high hand and a visitation of great glory, when the sea was parted for you, 
and a passage left dry, in which [God] slew those @ho pursued you with a very 
great equipment, and splendid chariots, bringing back upon them the sea which 
had been made a way for your sakes; on whom also a pillar of light shone, in 
order that you, more than any other nation in the world, might possess a 
peculiar light, never-failing and never-setting; for whom He rained manna as 
nourishment, fit for the heavenly angels, in order that you might have no need 
to prepare your food; and the water at Marah was made sweet; and a sign of Him 
that was to be crucified was made, both in the matter of the serpents which bit 
you, as I already mentioned (God anticipating before the proper times these 
mysteries, in order to confer grace upon you, to whom you are always convicted 
of being thankless), as well as in the type of the extending of the hands of 
Moses, and of Oshea being named Jesus (Joshua); when you fought against Amalek: 
concerning which God enjoined that the incident be recorded, and the name of 
Jesus laid up in your understandings; saying that this is He who would blot out 
the memorial of Amalek from under heaven. Now it is clear that the memorial of 
Amalek remained after the son of Nave (Nun): but He makes it manifest through 
Jesus, who was crucified, of whom also those symbols were fore-announcements of 
all that would happen to Him, the demons would be destroyed, and would dread His 
name, and that all principalities and kingdoms would fear Him; and that they who 
believe in Him out of all nations would be shown as God-fearing and peaceful 
men; and the facts already quoted by me, Trypho, indicate this. Again, when you 
desired flesh, so vast a quantity of quails was given you, that they could not 
be told; for whom also water gushed from the rock; and a cloud followed you for 
a shade from heat, and covering from cold, declaring the manner and 
signification of another and new heaven; the latchets of your shoes did not 
break, and your shoes waxed not old, and your garments wore not away, but even 
those of the children grew along with them. 
CHAPTER CXXXII -- HOW GREAT THE POWER WAS OF THE NAME OF JESUS IN THE OLD 
TESTAMENT. 
"Yet after this you made a calf, and were very zealous in committing 
fornication with the daughters of strangers, and in serving idols. And again, 
when the land was given up to you with so great a display of power, that you 
witnessed the sun stand still in the heavens by the order of that man whose name 
was Jesus (Joshua), and not go down for thirty-six hours, as well as all the 
other miracles which were wrought for you as time served; and of these it seems 
good to me now to speak of another, for it conduces to your hereby knowing 
Jesus, whom we also know to have been Christ the Son of God, who was crucified, 
and rose again, and ascended to heaven, and will come again to judge all men, 
even up to Adam himself. You are aware, then," I continued, "that when the ark 
of the testimony was seized by the enemies of Ashdod, and a terrible and 
incurable malady had broken out among them, they resolved to place it on a cart 
to which they yoked cows that had recently calved, for the purpose of 
ascertaining by trial whether or not they had been plagued by God's power on 
account of the ark, and if God wished it to be taken back to the place from 
which it had been carried away. And when they had done this, the cows, led by no 
man, went not to the place whence the ark had been taken, but to the fields of a 
certain man whose name was Oshea, the same as his whose name was altered to 
Jesus (Joshua), as has been previously mentioned, who also led the people into 
the land and meted it out to them: and when the cows had come into these fields 
they remained there, showing to you thereby that they were guided by the name of 
power; just as formerly the people who survived of those that came out of Egypt, 
were guided into the land by him who had received the name Jesus (Joshua), who 
before was called Oshea. 
CHAPTER CXXXIII -- THE HARD-HEARTEDNESS OF THE JEWS, FOR WHOM THE CHRISTIANS 
PRAY. 
"Now, although these and all other such unexpected and marvellous works were 
wrought amongst and seen by you at different times, yet you are convicted by the 
prophets of having gone to such a length as offering your own children to 
demons; and besides all this, of having dared to do such things against Christ; 
and you still dare to do them: for all which may it be granted to you to obtain 
mercy and salvation from God and His Christ. For God, knowing before that you 
would do such things, pronounced this curse upon you by the prophet Isaiah: 'Woe 
unto their soul! they have devised evil counsel against themselves, saying, Let 
us bind the righteous man, for he is distasteful to us. Therefore they shall eat 
the fruit of their own doings. Woe to the wicked! evil, according to the works 
of his hands, shall befall him. O my people, your exactors glean you, and those 
who extort from you shall rule over you. O my people, they who call you blessed 
cause you to err, and disorder the way of your paths. But now the Lord shall 
sist His people to judgment, and He shall enter into judgment with the elders of 
the people and the princes thereof. But why have you burnt up my vineyard? and 
why is the spoil of the poor found in your houses? Why do you wrong my people, 
and put to shame the countenance of the humble?' Again, in other words, the same 
prophet spake to the same effect: 'Woe unto them that draw their iniquity as 
with a long cord, and their transgressions as with the harness of an heifer's 
yoke: who say, Let His speed come near, and let the counsel of the Holy One of 
Israel come, that we may know it. Woe unto them that call evil good, and good 
evil! that put light for darkness, and darkness for light! that put bitter for 
sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and 
prudent in their own sight! Woe unto those that are mighty among you, who drink 
wine, who are men of strength, who mingle strong drink! who justify the wicked 
for a reward, and take away justice from the righteous! Therefore, as the 
stubble shall be burnt by the coal of fire, and utterly consumed by the burning 
flame, their root shall be as wool, and their flower shall go up like dust. For 
they would not have the law of the Lord of Sabaoth, but despised the word of the 
Lord, the Holy One of Israel. And the Lord of Sabaoth was very angry, and laid 
His hands upon them, and smote them; and He was provoked against the mountains, 
and their carcases were in the midst like dung on the road. And for all this 
they have not repented, but their hand is still high.' For verily your hand is 
high to commit evil, because ye slew the Christ, and do not repent of it; but so 
far from that, ye hate and murder us who have believed through Him in the God 
and Father of all, as often as ye can; and ye curse Him without ceasing, as well 
as those who side with Him; while all of us pray for you, and for all men, as 
our Christ and Lord taught us to do, when He enjoined us to pray even for our 
enemies, and to love them that hate us, and to bless them that curse us. 
CHAPTER CXXXIV -- THE MARRIAGES OF JACOB ARE A FIGURE OF THE CHURCH. 
"If, then, the teaching of the prophets and of Himself moves you, it is 
better for you to follow God than your imprudent and blind masters, who even 
till this time permit each man to have four or five wives; and if any one see a 
beautiful woman and desire to have her, they quote the doings of Jacob [called] 
Israel, and of the other patriarchs, and maintain that it is not wrong to do 
such things; for they are miserably ignorant in this matter. For, as I before 
said, certain dispensations of weighty mysteries were accomplished in each act 
of this sort. For in the marriages of Jacob I shall mention what dispensation 
and prophecy were accomplished, in order that you may thereby know that your 
teachers never looked at the divine motive which prompted each act, but only at 
the grovelling and corrupting passions. Attend therefore to what I say. The 
marriages of Jacob were types of that which Christ was about to accomplish. For 
it was not lawful for Jacob to marry two sisters at once. And he serves Laban 
for [one of] the daughters; and being deceived in [the obtaining of] the 
younger, he again served seven years. Now Leah is your people and synagogue; but 
Rachel is our Church. And for these, and for the servants in both, Christ even 
now serves. For while Noah gave to the two sons the seed of the third as 
servants, now on the other hand Christ has come to restore both the free sons 
and the servants amongst them, conferring the same honour on all of them who 
keep His commandments; even as the children of the free women and the children 
of the bond women born to Jacob were all sons, and equal in dignity. And it was 
foretold what each should be according to rank and according to fore-knowledge. 
Jacob served Laban for speckled and many-spotted sheep; and Christ served, even 
to the slavery of the cross, for the various and many-formed races of mankind, 
acquiring them by the blood and mystery of the cross. Leah was weak-eyed; for 
the eyes of your souls are excessively weak. Rachel stole the gods of Laban, and 
has hid them to this day; and we have lost our paternal and material gods. Jacob 
was hated for all time by his brother; and we now, and our Lord Himself, are 
hated by you and by all men, though we are brothers by nature. Jacob was called 
Israel; and Israel has been demonstrated to be the Christ, who is, and is 
called, Jesus. 
CHAPTER CXXXV -- CHRIST IS KING OF ISRAEL, AND CHRISTIANS ARE THE ISRAELITIC 
RACE. 
"And when Scripture says, 'I am the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, who 
have made known Israel your King,' will you not understand that truly Christ is 
the everlasting King? For you are aware that Jacob the son of Isaac was never a 
king. And therefore Scripture again, explaining to us, says what king is meant 
by Jacob and Israel: 'Jacob is my Servant, I will uphold Him; and Israel is mine 
Elect, my soul shall receive Him. I have given Him my Spirit; and He shall bring 
forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, and His voice shall not be 
heard without. The bruised reed He shall not break, and the smoking flax He 
shall not quench, until He shall bring forth judgment to victory. He shall 
shine, and shall not be broken, until He set judgment on the earth. And in His 
name shall the Gentiles trust.' Then is it Jacob the patriarch in whom the 
Gentiles and yourselves shall trust? or is it not Christ? As, therefore, Christ 
is the Israel and the Jacob, even so we, who have been quarried out from the 
bowels of Christ, are the true Israelitic race. But let us attend rather to the 
very word: 'And I will bring forth,' He says, 'the seed out of Jacob, and out of 
Judah: and it shall inherit My holy mountain; and Mine Elect and My servants 
shall possess the inheritance, and shall dwell there; and there shall be folds 
of flocks in the thicket, and the valley of Achor shall be a resting-place of 
cattle for the people who have sought Me. But as for you, who forsake Me, and 
forget My holy mountain, and prepare a table for demons, and fill out drink for 
the demon, I shall give you to the sword. You shall all fall with a slaughter; 
for I called you, and you hearkened not, and did evil before me, and did choose 
that wherein I delighted not.' Such are the words of Scripture; understand, 
therefore, that the seed of Jacob now referred to is something else, and not, as 
may be supposed, spoken of your people. For it is not possible for the seed of 
Jacob to leave an entrance for the descendants of Jacob, or for [God] to have 
accepted the very same persons whom He had reproached with unfitness for the 
inheritance, and promise it to them again; but as there the prophet says, 'And 
now, O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of the Lord; for He has 
sent away His people, the house of Jacob, because their land was full, as at the 
first, of soothsayers and divinations;' even so it is necessary for us here to 
observe that there are two seeds of Judah, and two races, as there are two 
houses of Jacob: the one begotten by blood and flesh, the other by faith and the 
Spirit. 
CHAPTER CXXXVI -- THE JEWS, IN REJECTING CHRIST, REJECTED GOD WHO SENT HIM. 
"For you see how He now addresses the people, saying a little before: 'As the 
gape shah be found in the cluster, and they will say, Destroy it not, for a 
blessing is in it; so will I do for My servant's sake: for His sake I will not 
destroy them all.' And thereafter He adds: 'And I shall bring forth the seed out 
of Jacob, and out of Judah.' It is plain then that if He thus be angry with 
them, and threaten to leave very few of them, He promises to bring forth certain 
others, who shall dwell in His mountain. But these are the persons whom He said 
He would sow and beget. For you neither suffer Him when He calls you, nor hear 
Him when He speaks to you, but have done evil in the presence of the Lord. But 
the highest pitch of your wickedness lies in this, that you hate the Righteous 
One, and slew Him; and so treat those who have received from Him all that they 
are and have, and who are pious, righteous, and humane. Therefore 'woe unto 
their soul,' says' the Lord, 'for they have devised an evil counsel against 
themselves, saying, Let us take away the righteous, for he is distasteful to 
us.' For indeed you are not in the habit of sacrificing to Baal, as were your 
fathers, or of placing cakes in groves and on high places for the host of 
heaven: but you have not accepted God's Christ. For he who knows not Him, knows 
not the will of God; and he who insults and hates Him, insults and hates Him 
that sent Him. And whoever believes not in Him, believes not the declarations of 
the prophets, who preached and proclaimed Him to all. 
CHAPTER CXXXVII -- HE EXHORTS THE JEWS TO BE CONVERTED. 
"Say no evil thing, my brothers, against Him that was crucified, and treat 
not scornfully the stripes wherewith all may be healed, even as we are healed. 
For it will be well if, persuaded by the Scriptures, you are circumcised from 
hard-heartedness: not that circumcision which you have from the tenets that are 
put into you; for that was given for a sign, and not for a work of 
righteousness, as the Scriptures compel you [to admit]. Assent, therefore, and 
pour no ridicule on the Son of God; obey not the Pharisaic teachers, and scoff 
not at the King of Israel, as the rulers of your synagogues teach you to do 
after your prayers: for if he that touches those who are not pleasing to God, is 
as one that touches the apple of God's eye, how much more so is he that touches 
His beloved! And that this is He, has been sufficiently demonstrated." 
And as they kept silence, I continued: "My friends, I now refer to the 
Scriptures as the Seventy have interpreted them; for when I quoted them formerly 
as you possess them, I made proof of you [to ascertain] how you were disposed. 
For, mentioning the Scripture which says, 'Woe unto them! for they have devised 
evil counsel against themselves, saying (as the Seventy have translated, I 
continued): 'Let us take away the righteous, for he is distasteful to us;' 
whereas at the commencement of the discussion I added what your version has: 
'Let us bind the righteous, for he is distaste fill to us.' But you had been 
busy about some other matter, and seem to have listened to the words without 
attending to them. But now, since the day is drawing to a close, for the sun is 
about to set, I shall add one remark to what I have said, and conclude. I have 
indeed made the very same remark already, but I think it would be right to 
bestow some consideration on it again. 
CHAPTER CXXXVIII -- NOAH IS A FIGURE OF CHRIST, WHO HAS REGENERATED US BY 
WATER, AND FAITH, AND WOOD: [i.e., the Cross.] 
"You know, then, sirs," I said, "that God has said in Isaiah to Jerusalem: 'I 
saved thee in the deluge of Noah.' By this which God said was meant that the 
mystery of saved men appeared in the deluge. For righteous Noah, along with the 
other mortals at the deluge, i.e., with his own wife, his three sons and their 
wives, being eight in number, were a symbol of the eighth day, wherein Christ 
appeared when He rose from the dead, for ever the first in power. For Christ, 
being the first-born of every creature, became again the chief of another race 
regenerated by Himself through water, and faith, and wood, containing the 
mystery of the cross; even as Noah was saved by wood when he rode over the 
waters with his household. Accordingly, when the prophet says, 'I saved thee in 
the times of Noah,' as I have already remarked, he addresses the people who are 
equally faithful to God, and possess the same signs. For when Moses had the rod 
in his hands, he led your nation through the sea. And you believe that this was 
spoken to your nation only, or to the land. But the whole earth, as the 
Scripture says, was inundated, and the water rose in height fifteen cubits above 
all the mountains: so that it is evident this was not spoken to the land, but to 
the people who obeyed Him: for whom also He had before prepared a resting-place 
in Jerusalem, as was previously demonstrated by all the symbols of the deluge; I 
mean, that by water, faith, and wood, those who are afore-prepared, and who 
repent of the sins which they have committed, shall escape from the impending 
judgment of God. 
CHAPTER CXXXIX -- THE BLESSINGS, AND ALSO THE CURSE, PRONOUNCED BY NOAH WERE 
PROPHECIES OF THE FUTURE. 
"For another mystery was accomplished and predicted in the days of Noah, of 
which you are not aware. It is this: in the blessings wherewith Noah blessed his 
two sons, and in the curse pronounced on his son's son. For the Spirit of 
prophecy would not curse the son that had been by God blessed along with [his 
brothers]. But since the punishment of the sin would cleave to the whole descent 
of the son that mocked at his father's nakedness, he made the curse originate 
with his son. Now, in what he said, he foretold that the descendants of Shem 
would keep in retention the property and dwellings of Canaan: and again that the 
descendants of Japheth would take possession of the property of which Shem's 
descendants had dispossessed Canaan's descendants; and spoil the descendants of 
Shem, even as they plundered the sons of Canaan. And listen to the way in which 
it has so come to pass. For you, who have derived your lineage from Shem, 
invaded the territory of the sons of Canaan by the will of God; and you 
possessed it. And it is manifest that the sons of Japheth, having invaded you in 
turn by the judgment of God, have taken your land from you, and have possessed 
it. Thus it is written: 'And Noah awoke from the wine, and knew what his younger 
son had done unto him; and he said, Cursed be Canaan, the servant; a servant 
shall he be unto his brethren. And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and 
Canaan shall be his servant. May the Lord enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in 
the houses of Shem; and let Canaan be his servant.' Accordingly, as two peoples 
were blessed,--those from Shem, and those from Japheth,--and as the offspring of 
Shem were decreed first to possess the dwellings of Canaan, and the offspring of 
Japheth were predicted as in turn receiving the same possessions, and to the two 
peoples there was the one people of Canaan handed over for servants; so Christ 
has come according to the power given Him from the Almighty Father, and 
summoning men to friendship, and blessing, and repentance, and dwelling 
together, has promised, as has already been proved, that there shall be a future 
possession for all the saints in this same land. And hence all men everywhere, 
whether bond or free, who believe in Christ, and recognise the truth in His own 
words and those of His prophets, know that they shall be with Him in that land, 
and inherit everlasting and incorruptible good. 
CHAPTER CXL -- IN CHRIST ALL ARE FREE. THE JEWS HOPE FOR SALVATION IN VAIN 
BECAUSE THEY ARE SONS OF ABRAHAM. 
"Hence also Jacob, as I remarked before, being himself a type of Christ, had 
married the two handmaids of his two free wives, and of them begat sons, for the 
purpose of indicating beforehand that Christ would receive even all those who 
amongst Japheth's race are descendants of Canaan, equally with the free, and 
would have the children fellow-heirs. And we are such; but you cannot comprehend 
this, because you cannot drink of the living fountain of God, but of broken 
cisterns which can hold no water, as the Scripture says. But they are cisterns 
broken, and holding no water, which your own teachers have digged, as the 
Scripture also expressly asserts, 'teaching for doctrines the commandments of 
men.' And besides, they beguile themselves and you, supposing that the 
everlasting kingdom will be assuredly given to those of the dispersion who are 
of Abraham after the flesh, although they be sinners, and faithless, and 
disobedient towards God, which the Scriptures have proved is not the case. For 
if so, Isaiah would never have said this: 'And unless the Lord of Sabaoth had 
left us a seed, we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah.' And Ezekiel: 'Even 
if Noah, and Jacob, and Daniel were to pray for sons or daughters, their request 
should not be granted.' But neither shall the father perish for the son, nor the 
son for the father; but every one for his own sin, and each shall be saved for 
his own righteousness. And again Isaiah says: 'They shall look on the car; cases 
of them that have transgressed: their worm shall not cease, and their fire shall 
not be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh.' And our Lord, 
according to the will of Him that sent Him, who is the Father and Lord of all, 
would not have said, 'They shall come from the east, and from the west, and 
shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But 
the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.' Furthermore, 
I have proved in what has preceded," that those who were foreknown to be 
unrighteous, whether men or angels, are not made wicked by God's fault, but each 
man by his own fault is what he will appear to be. 
CHAPTER CXLI -- FREE-WILL IN MEN AND ANGELS. 
"But that you may not have a pretext for saying that Christ must have been 
crucified, and that those who transgressed must have been among your nation, and 
that the matter could not have been otherwise, I said briefly by anticipation, 
that God, wishing men and angels to follow His will, resolved to create them 
free to do righteousness; possessing reason, that they may know by whom they are 
created, and through whom they, not existing formerly, do now exist; and with a 
law that they should be judged by Him, if they do anything contrary to right 
reason: and of ourselves we, men and angels, shall be convicted of having acted 
sinfully, unless we repent beforehand. But if the word of God foretells that 
some angels and men shall be certainly punished, it did so because it foreknew 
that they would be unchangeably [wicked], but not because God had created them 
so. So that if they repent, all who wish for it can obtain mercy from God: and 
the Scripture foretells that they shall be blessed, saying, 'Blessed is the man 
to whom the Lord imputeth not sin;' that is, having repented of his sins, that 
he may receive remission of them from God; and not as you deceive yourselves, 
and some others who resemble you in this, who say, that even though they be 
sinners, but know God, the Lord will not impute sin to them. We have as proof of 
this the one fall of David, which happened through his boasting, which was 
forgiven then when he so mourned and wept, as it is written. But if even to such 
a man no remission was granted before repentance, and only when this great king, 
and anointed one, and prophet, mourned and conducted himself so, how can the 
impure and utterly abandoned, if they weep not, and mourn not, and repent not, 
entertain the hope that the Lord will not impute to them sin? And this one fall 
of David, in the matter of Uriah's wife, proves, sirs," I said, "that the 
patriarchs had many wives, not to commit fornication, but that a certain 
dispensation and all mysteries might be accomplished by them; since, if it were 
allowable to take any wife, or as many wives as one chooses, and how he chooses, 
which the men of your nation do over all the earth, wherever they sojourn, or 
wherever they have been sent, taking women under the name of marriage, much more 
would David have been permitted to do this." 
When I had said this, dearest Marcus Pompeius, I came to an end. 
CHAPTER CXLII -- THE JEWS RETURN THANKS, AND LEAVE JUSTIN. 
Then Trypho, after a little delay, said, "You see that it was not 
intentionally that we came to discuss these points. And I confess that I have 
been particularly pleased with the conference; and I think that these are of 
quite the same opinion as myself. For we have found more than we expected, and 
more than it was possible to have expected. And if we could do this more 
frequently, we should be much helped in the searching of the Scriptures 
themselves. But since," he said, "you are on the eve of departure, and expect 
daily to set sail, do not hesitate to remember us as friends when you are gone." 

"For my part," I replied, "if I had remained, I would have wished to do the 
same thing daily. But now, since I expect, with God's will and aid, to set sail, 
I exhort you to give all diligence in this very great struggle for your own 
salvation, and to be earnest in setting a higher value on the Christ of the 
Almighty God than on your own teachers." 
After this they left me, wishing me safety in my voyage, and from every 
misfortune. And I, praying for them, said, "I can wish no better thing for you, 
sirs, than this, that, recognising in this way that intelligence is given to 
every man, you may be of the same opinion as ourselves, and believe that Jesus 
is the Christ of God."
