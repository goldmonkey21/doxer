Epistle of James












The Letter from James 

1:1James, a servant of God and of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings. 1:2Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall 
into various temptations, 1:3knowing that the testing of your faith 
produces endurance. 1:4Let endurance have its perfect work, 
that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. 1:5But if any of you 
lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without 
reproach; and it will be given to him. 1:6But let him ask in faith, without any 
doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and 
tossed. 1:7For let that man not think that he will 
receive anything from the Lord. 1:8He is a double-minded man, unstable in 
all his ways. 
1:9But let the brother in humble 
circumstances glory in his high position; 1:10and the rich, in 
that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away. 
1:11For the sun arises with the scorching 
wind, and withers the grass, and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its 
appearance perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits. 
1:12Blessed is the man who endures 
temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, 
which the Lord promised to those who love him. 1:13Let no man say when 
he is tempted, "I am tempted by God," for God can't be tempted by evil, and he 
himself tempts no one. 1:14But each one is tempted, when he is 
drawn away by his own lust, and enticed. 1:15Then the lust, when it has conceived, 
bears sin; and the sin, when it is full grown, brings forth death. 1:16Don't be deceived, my beloved brothers. 
1:17Every good gift and every perfect gift 
is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no 
variation, nor turning shadow. 1:18Of his own will he brought us forth by 
the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures. 
1:19So, then, my beloved brothers, let 
every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger; 1:20for the anger of man doesn't produce 
the righteousness of God. 1:21Therefore, putting away all filthiness 
and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which 
is able to save your 
souls. 1:22But be doers of the word, and not only 
hearers, deluding your own selves. 1:23For if anyone is a hearer of the word 
and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a mirror; 1:24for he sees himself, and goes away, and 
immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 1:25But he who looks 
into the perfect law, the law of freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who 
forgets but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does. 
1:26If anyone among you thinks himself to 
be religious while he doesn't bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this 
man's religion is worthless. 1:27Pure religion and undefiled before our 
God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, 
and to keep oneself unstained by the world. 
2:1My brothers, don't hold the faith of our 
Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality. 2:2For if a man with a 
gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your assembly, and a poor man in filthy 
clothing also comes in; 2:3and you pay special attention to him who 
wears the fine clothing, and say, "Sit here in a good place;" and you tell the 
poor man, "Stand there," or "Sit by my footstool;" 2:4haven't you shown 
partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? 2:5Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn't God 
choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the 
Kingdom which he promised to those who love him? 2:6But you have 
dishonored the poor man. Don't the rich oppress you, and personally drag you 
before the courts? 2:7Don't they blaspheme the honorable name 
by which you are called? 2:8However, if you fulfill the royal law, 
according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do 
well. 2:9But if you show partiality, you commit 
sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors. 2:10For whoever shall 
keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he has become guilty of all. 
2:11For he who said, "Do not commit 
adultery," said also, "Do not commit murder." Now if you do not commit adultery, 
but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. 2:12So speak, and so 
do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom. 2:13For judgment is 
without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. 
2:14What good is it, my brothers, if a man 
says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him? 2:15And if a brother or 
sister is naked and in lack of daily food, 2:16and one of you 
tells them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled;" and yet you didn't give them 
the things the body needs, what good is it? 2:17Even so faith, if 
it has no works, is dead in itself. 2:18Yes, a man will say, "You have faith, 
and I have works." Show me your faith from your works, and I by my works will 
show you my faith. 
2:19You believe that God is one. You do 
well. The demons also believe, and shudder. 2:20But do you want to 
know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead? 2:21Wasn't Abraham our 
father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? 2:22You see that faith worked with his 
works, and by works faith was perfected; 2:23and the Scripture was fulfilled which 
says, "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness;" and 
he was called the friend of God. 2:24You see then that by works, a man is 
justified, and not only by faith. 2:25In like manner wasn't Rahab the 
prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and 
sent them out another way? 2:26For as the body apart from the spirit 
is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead. 
3:1Let not many of you be teachers, my 
brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment. 3:2For in many things 
we all stumble. If anyone doesn't stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, 
able to bridle the whole body also. 3:3Indeed, we put bits into the horses' 
mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body. 3:4Behold, the ships also, though they are 
so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, 
wherever the pilot desires. 3:5So the tongue is also a little member, 
and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest! 3:6And 
the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, 
which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set 
on fire by Gehenna.
3:7For every kind of animal, bird, creeping 
thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind. 3:8But 
nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 3:9With 
it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the 
image of God. 3:10Out of the same mouth comes forth 
blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. 3:11Does a spring send out from the same 
opening fresh and bitter water? 3:12Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield 
olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water. 
3:13Who is wise and understanding among 
you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of 
wisdom. 3:14But if you have bitter jealousy and 
selfish ambition in your heart, don't boast and don't lie against the truth. 3:15This wisdom is not that which comes 
down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic. 3:16For where jealousy 
and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed. 3:17But the wisdom that is from above is 
first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, 
without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 3:18Now the fruit of 
righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. 
4:1Where do wars and fightings among you 
come from? Don't they come from your pleasures that war in your members? 4:2You 
lust, and don't have. You kill, covet, and can't obtain. You fight and make war. 
You don't have, because you don't ask. 4:3You ask, and don't receive, because you 
ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures. 4:4You 
adulterers and adulteresses, don't you know that friendship with the world is 
enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes 
himself an enemy of God. 4:5Or do you think that the Scripture says 
in vain, "The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously"? 4:6But he gives more 
grace. Therefore it says, "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the 
humble." 4:7Be subject therefore to God. But resist 
the devil, and he will flee from you. 4:8Draw near to God, and he will draw near 
to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you 
double-minded. 4:9Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your 
laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom. 4:10Humble yourselves 
in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you. 
4:11Don't speak against one another, 
brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against 
the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the 
law, but a judge. 4:12Only one is the lawgiver, who is able 
to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another? 
4:13Come now, you who say, "Today or 
tomorrow let's go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a 
profit." 4:14Whereas you don't know what your life 
will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor, that appears 
for a little time, and then vanishes away. 4:15For you ought to 
say, "If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that." 4:16But now you glory in your boasting. All 
such boasting is evil. 4:17To him therefore who knows to do good, 
and doesn't do it, to him it is sin. 
5:1Come now, you rich, weep and howl for 
your miseries that are coming on you. 5:2Your riches are corrupted and your 
garments are moth-eaten. 5:3Your gold and your silver are corroded, 
and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh 
like fire. You have laid up your treasure in the last days. 5:4Behold, the wages of 
the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out, 
and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of 
Hosts. 5:5You have lived delicately on the earth, 
and taken your pleasure. You have nourished your hearts as in a day of 
slaughter. 5:6You have condemned, you have murdered 
the righteous one. He doesn't resist you. 
5:7Be patient therefore, brothers, until 
the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the 
earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rain. 5:8You 
also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. 
5:9Don't grumble, brothers, against one 
another, so that you won't be judged. Behold, the judge stands at the door. 5:10Take, brothers, for an example of 
suffering and of patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 5:11Behold, we call them blessed who 
endured. You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the Lord in the 
outcome, and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy. 5:12But above all 
things, my brothers, don't swear, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by 
any other oath; but let your "yes" be "yes," and your "no," "no;" so that you 
don't fall into 
hypocrisy.
5:13Is any among you suffering? Let him 
pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praises. 5:14Is any among you 
sick? Let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, 
anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord, 5:15and the prayer of 
faith will heal him who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has 
committed sins, he will be forgiven. 5:16Confess your offenses to one another, 
and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The effective, earnest prayer 
of a righteous man is powerfully effective. 5:17Elijah was a man 
with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it 
didn't rain on the earth for three years and six months. 5:18He prayed again, 
and the sky gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit. 
5:19Brothers, if any among you wanders from 
the truth, and someone turns him back, 5:20let him know that he who turns a sinner 
from the error of his way will save a soul from death, and will cover a 
multitude of sins.
