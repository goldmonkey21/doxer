TERTULLIAN 
ON BAPTISM.
[TRANSLATED BY THE REV. S. THELWALL.]
CHAP. I.--INTRODUCTION. ORIGIN OF THE
TREATISE.
HAPPY iS our sacrament Of water, in that, by washing away the sins of our 
early blindness, we are set free and admitted into eternal life! A treatise on 
this matter will not be superfluous; instructing not only such as are just 
becoming formed (in the faith), but them who, content with having simply 
believed, without full examination of the grounds of the traditions, carry (in 
mind), through ignorance, an untried though probable faith. The consequence is, 
that a viper of the Cainite heresy, lately conversant in this quarter, has 
carried away a great number with her most venomous doctrine, making it her first 
aim to destroy baptism. Which is quite in accordance with nature; for vipers and 
asps and basilisks themselves generally do affect arid and waterless places. But 
we, little fishes, after the example of our IXq,s204>S Jesus 
Christ, are born in water, nor have we safety in any other way than by 
permanently abiding in water; so that most monstrous creature, who had no right 
to teach even sound doctrine, knew full well how to kill the little fishes, by 
taking them away from the water! 
CHAP. II.--THE VERY SIMPLICITY OF GOD'S MEANS OF WORKING, A
STUMBLING-BLOCK TO THE CARNAL MIND.
Well, but how great is the force of perversity for so shaking the faith or 
entirely preventing its reception, that it impugns it on the very principles of 
which the faith consists! There is absolutely nothing which makes men's minds 
more obdurate than the simplicity of the divine works which are visible in the 
act, when compared with the grandeur which is promised thereto in the effect; so 
that from the very fact, that with so great simplicity, without pomp, without 
any considerable novelty of .preparation, finally, without expense, a man is 
dipped in water, and amid the utterance of some few words, is sprinkled, and 
then rises again, not much (or not at all) the cleaner, the consequent 
attainment of eternity s is esteemed the more incredible. I am a deceiver if, on 
the contrary, it is not from their circumstance, and preparation, and expense, 
that idols' solemnities or mysteries get their credit and authority built up. 
Oh, miserable incredulity, which quite deniest to God His own properties, 
simplicity and power! What then? Is it not wonderful, too, that death should be 
washed away by bathing? But it is the more to be believed if the wonderfulness 
be the reason why it is not believed. For what does it behove divine works to be 
in their quality, except that they be above all wonder? We also ourselves 
wonder, but it is because we believe. Incredulity, on the other hand, wonders, 
but does not believe: for the simple acts it wonders at, as if they were vain; 
the grand results, as if they were impossible. And grant that it be just as you 
think? sufficient to meet each point is the divine declaration which has 
fore-run: "The foolish things of the world hath God elected to confound its 
wisdom;" and, "The things very difficult with men are easy with God." For if God 
is wise and powerful (which even they who pass Him by do not deny), it is with 
good reason that He lays the material causes of His own operation in the 670 
contraries of wisdom and of power, that is, in foolishness and impossibility; 
since every virtue receives its cause from those things by which it is called 
forth. 
CHAP. III.--WATER CHOSEN AS A VEHICLE OF DIVINE OPERATION AND 
WHEREFORE. ITS PROMINENCE FIRST OF ALL IN CREATION.
Mindful of this declaration as of a conclusive prescript, we nevertheless 
proceed to treat the question, "How foolish and impossible it is to be formed 
anew by water. In what respect, pray, has this material substance merited an 
office of so high dignity?" The authority, I suppose, of the liquid element has 
to be examined. This however, is found in abundance, and that from the very 
beginning. For water is one of those things which, before all the furnishing of 
the world, were quiescent with God in a yet unshapen state. 
"In the first beginning," saith Scripture, "God made the heaven and the 
earth. 
But the earth was invisible, and unorganized, and darkness was over the 
abyss; and the Spirit of the Lord was hovering over the waters." The first 
thing, O man, which you have to venerate, is the age of the, waters in that 
their substance is ancient; the second, their dignity, in that they were the 
seat of the Divine Spirit, more pleasing to Him, no doubt, than all the other 
then existing elements. For the darkness was total thus far, shapeless, without 
the ornament of stars; and the abyss gloomy; and the earth unfurnished; and the 
heaven unwrought: water alone--always a perfect, gladsome, simple material 
substance, pure in itself--supplied a worthy vehicle to God. What of the fact 
that waters were in some way the regulating powers by which the disposition of 
the world thenceforward was constituted by God? For the suspension of the 
celestial firmament in the midst He caused by "dividing the waters;" the 
suspension of "the dry land" He accomplished by "separating the waters." After 
the world had been hereupon set in order through its elements, when inhabitants 
were given it, "the waters" were the first to receive the precept "to bring 
forth living creatures." Water was the first to produce that which had life, 
that it might be no wonder in baptism if waters know how to give life. For was 
not the work of fashioning man himself also achieved with the aid of waters? 
Suitable material is found in the earth, yet not apt for the purpose unless it 
be moist and juicy; which (earth) "the waters," separated the fourth day before 
into their own place, temper with their remaining moisture to a clayey 
consistency. If, from that time onward, I go forward in recounting universally, 
or at more length, the evidences of the "authority" of this element which I can 
adduce to show how great is its power or its grace; how many ingenious devices, 
how many functions, how useful an instrumentality, it affords the world, I fear 
I may seem to have collected rather the praises of water than the reasons of 
baptism; although I should thereby teach all the more fully, that it is not to 
be doubted that God has made the material substance which He has disposed 
throughout all His products and works, obey Him also in His own peculiar 
sacraments; that the material substance which governs terrestrial life acts as 
agent likewise in the celestial. 
CHAP. IV.--THE PRIMEVAL HOVERING OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD OVER THE 
WATERS TYPICAL OFBAPTISM.THE UNIVERSAL ELEMENT OF WATER THUS MADE 
A CHANNEL OF SANCTIFICATION. RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE OUTWARD SIGN 
AND THE INWARD GRACE.
But it will suffice to have this called at the outset those points in which 
withal is recognised that primary principle of baptism,--which was even then 
fore-noted by the very attitude assumed for a type of baptism,--that the Spirit 
of God, who hovered over (the waters) from the beginning, would continue to 
linger over the waters of the baptized. But a holy thing, of course, hovered 
over a holy; or else, from that which hovered over that which was hovered over 
borrowed a holiness, since it is necessary that in every case an underlying 
material substance should catch the quality of that which overhangs it, most of 
all a corporeal of a spiritual, adapted (as the spiritual is) through the 
subtleness of its substance, both for penetrating and insinuating. Thus the 
nature of the waters, sanctified by the Holy One, itself conceived withal the 
power of sanctifying. Let no one say, "Why then, are we, pray, baptized with the 
very waters which then existed in the first beginning?" Not with those waters, 
of course, except in so far as the genus indeed is one, but the species very 
many. But what is an attribute to the genus reappears likewise in the species. 
And accordingly it makes no 671 
difference whether a man be washed in a sea or a pool, a stream or a fount, a 
lake or a trough; nor is there any distinction between those whom John baptized 
in the Jordan and those whom Peter baptized in the Tiber, unless withal the 
eunuch whom Philip baptized in the midst of his journeys with chance water, 
derived (therefrom) more or less of salvation than others. 
All waters, therefore, in virtue of the pristine privilege of their origin, 
do, after invocation of God, attain the sacramental power of sanctification; for 
the Spirit immediately supervenes from the heavens, and rests over the waters, 
sanctifying them from Himself; and being thus sanctified, they imbibe at the 
same time the power of sanctifying. Albeit the similitude may be admitted to be 
suitable to the simple act; that, since we are defiled by sins, as it were by 
dirt, we should be washed from those stains in waters. But as sins do not 'show 
themselves in our flesh (inasmuch as no one carries on his skin the spot of 
idolatry, or fornication, or fraud), so persons of that kind are foul in the 
spirit, which is the author of the sin; for the spirit is lord, the flesh 
servant. Yet they each mutually share the guilt: the spirit, on the ground of 
command; the flesh, of subservience. Therefore, after the waters have been in a 
manner endued with medicinal virtue through the intervention of the angel, the 
spirit is corporeally washed in the waters, and the flesh is in the same 
spiritually cleansed. 
CHAP. V.--USE MADE OF WATER BY THE HEATHEN. TYPE OF THE ANGEL AT 
THE POOL OF BETHSAIDA.
"Well, but the nations, who are strangers to all understanding of spiritual 
powers, ascribe to their idols the imbuing of waters with the self-same 
efficacy." (So they do) but they cheat themselves with waters which are widowed. 
For washing is the channel through which they are initiated into some sacred 
rites--of some notorious Isis or Mithras. The gods themselves likewise they 
honour by washings. Moreover, by carrying water around, and sprinkling it, they 
everywhere expiate country-seats, houses, temples, and whole cities: at all 
events, at the Apollinarian and Eleusinian games they are baptized; and they 
presume that the effect of their doing that is their regeneration and the 
remission of the penalties due to their perjuries. Among the ancients, again, 
whoever had defiled himself with murder, was wont to go in quest of purifying 
waters. Therefore, if the mere nature of water, in that it is the appropriate 
material for washing away, leads men to flatter themselves with a belief in 
omens of purification, how much more truly will waters render that service 
through the authority of God, by whom all their nature has been constituted! If 
men think that water is endued with a medicinal virtue by religion, what 
religion is more effectual than that of the living God? Which fact being 
acknowledged, we recognise here also the zeal of the devil rivalling the things 
of God, while we find him, too, practising baptism in his subjects. What 
similarity is there? The unclean cleanses! the ruiner sets free! the damned 
absolves! He will, forsooth, destroy his own work, by washing away the sins 
which himself inspires! These (remarks) have been set down by way of testimony 
against such as reject the faith; if they put no trust in the things of God, the 
spurious imitations of which, in the case of God's rival, they do trust in. Are 
there not other cases too, in which, without any sacrament, unclean spirits 
brood on waters, in spurious imitation of that brooding of the Divine Spirit in 
the very beginning? Witness all shady founts, and all unfrequented brooks, and 
the ponds in the baths, and the conduits in private houses, or the cisterns and 
wells which are said to have the property of "spiriting away," through the 
power, that is, of a hurtful spirit. Men whom waters have drowned or affected 
with madness or with fear, they call nymph-caught, or "lymphatic," or" 
hydro-phobic." Why have we adduced these instances? Lest any think it too 
hard far belief that a holy angel of God should grant his presence to waters, to 
temper them to man's salvation; while the evil angel holds frequent profane 
commerce with the selfsame element to man's ruin. If it seems a novelty for an 
angel to be present in waters, an example of what was to come to pass has 
forerun. An angel, by his intervention, was wont to stir the pool at Bethsaida. 
They who were complaining of ill-health used to watch for him; for whoever had 
been the first to descend into them, after his washing, ceased to complain. This 
figure of corporeal healing sang of a 672 
spiritual healing, according to the rule by which things carnal are always 
antecedent as figurative of things spiritual. And thus, when the grace of God 
advanced to higher degrees among men, an accession of efficacy was granted to 
the waters and to the angel. They who were wont to remedy bodily defects, now 
heal the spirit; they who used to work temporal salvation? now renew eternal; 
they who did set free but once in the year, now save peoples in a body daily, 
death being done away through ablution of sins. The guilt being removed, of 
course the penalty is removed too. Thus man will be restored for God to His 
"likeness," who in days bygone had been conformed to "the image" of God; (the 
"image" is counted (to be) in his form: the "likeness" in his eternity:) for he 
receives again that Spirit of God which he had then first received from His 
afflatus, but had afterward lost through sin. 
CHAP. VI.--THE ANGEL THE FORERUNNER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. MEANING
CONTAINED IN THE BAPTISMAL FORMULA.
Not that in the waters we obtain the Holy Spirit; but in the water, under 
(the witness of) the angel, we are cleansed, and prepared for the Holy Spirit. 
In this case also a type has preceded; for thus was John beforehand the Lord's 
forerunner, "preparing His ways." Thus, too, does the angel, the witness of 
baptism, "make the paths straight" for the Holy Spirit, who is about to come 
upon us, by the washing away of sins, which faith, sealed in (the name of) the 
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, obtains. For if "in the mouth of three 
witnesses every word shall stand:"--while, through the benediction, we have the 
same (three) as witnesses of our faith whom we have as sureties' of our 
salvation too--how much more does the number of the divine names suffice for the 
assurance of our hope likewise! Moreover, after the pledging both of the 
attestation of faith and the promise of salvation under "three witnesses," there 
is added, of necessity, mention of the Church; inasmuch as, wherever there are 
three, (that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,) there is the Church, 
which is a body of three. 
CHAP. VII.--OF THE UNCTION.
After this, when we have issued from the font, we are thoroughly anointed 
with a blessed unction,-- (a practice derived) from the old discipline, wherein 
on entering the priesthood, then were wont to be anointed with oil from a horn, 
ever since Aaron was anointed by Moses. Whence Aaron is called "Christ," from 
the "chrism," which is "the unction;" which, when made spiritual, furnished an 
appropriate name to the Lord, because He was "anointed" with the Spirit by God 
the Father; as written in the Acts: "For truly they were gathered together in 
this city against Thy Holy Son whom Thou hast anointed." Thus, too, in our case, 
the unction runs cornally, (i.e. on the body,) but profits spiritually; in the 
same way as the act of baptism itself too is carnal, in that we are plunged in 
water, but the effect spiritual, in that we are freed from sins. 
CHAP. VIII.--OF THE IMPOSITION OF HANDS. TYPES OF THE DELUGE AND 
THE DOVE.
In the next place the hand is laid on us, invoking and inviting the Holy 
Spirit through benediction. Shall it be granted possible for human ingenuity to 
summon a spirit into water, and, by the application of hands from above, to 
animate their union into one body with another spirit of so clear sound; and 
shall it not be possible for God, in the case of His own organ, to produce, by 
means of "holy hands," a sublime spiritual modulation? But this, as well as the 
former, is derived from the old sacramental rite in which Jacob blessed his 
grandsons, born of Joseph, Ephrem and Manasses; with his hands laid on them and 
interchanged, and indeed so transversely slanted one over the other, that, by 
delineating Christ, they even portended the future benediction into Christ. 
Then, 673 
over our cleansed and blessed bodies willingly descends from the Father that 
Holiest Spirit. Over the waters of baptism, recognising as it were His primeval 
seat, He reposes: (He who) glided down on the Lord "in the shape of a dove," in 
order that the nature of the Holy Spirit might be declared by means of the 
creature (the emblem) of simplicity and innocence, because even in her bodily 
structure the dove is without literal gall. And accordingly He says, "Be ye 
simple as doves." Even this is not without the supporting evidence of a 
preceding figure. For just as, after the waters of the deluge, by which the old 
iniquity was purged--after the baptism, so to say, of the world--a dove was the 
herald which announced to the earth the assuagement of celestial wrath, when she 
had been sent her way out of the ark, and had returned with the olive-branch, a 
sign which even among the nations is the fore-token of peace; so by the 
self-same law of heavenly effect, to earth--that is, to our flesh--as it emerges 
from the font, after its old sins flies the dove of the Holy Spirit, bringing us 
the peace of God, sent out from the heavens where is the Church, the typified 
ark. But the world returned unto sin; in which point baptism would ill be 
compared to the deluge. And so it is destined to fire; just as the man too is, 
who after baptism renews his sins: so that this also ought to be accepted as a 
sign for our admonition. 
CHAP. IX.--TYPES OF THE RED SEA, AND THE WATER FROM THE ROCK.
How many, therefore, are the pleas of nature, how many the privileges of 
grace, how many the solemnities of discipline, the figures, the preparations, 
the prayers, which have ordained the sanctity of water? First, indeed, when the 
people, set unconditionally free, escaped the violence of the Egyptian king by 
crossing over through water, it was water that extinguished the king himself, 
with his entire forces. What figure more manifestly fulfilled in the sacrament 
of baptism? The nations are set free from the world by means of water, to wit: 
and the devil, their old tyrant, they leave quite behind, overwhelmed in the 
water. Again, water is restored from its defect of "bitterness" to its native 
grace of "sweetness" by the tree of Moses. That tree was Christ, restoring, to 
wit, of Himself, the veins of sometime envenomed and bitter nature into the 
all-salutary waters of baptism. This is the water which flowed continously down 
for the people from the "accompanying rock;" for if Christ is "the Rock," 
without doubt we see baptism blest by the water in Christ. How mighty is the 
grace of water, in the sight of God and His Christ, for the confirmation of 
baptism! Never is Christ without water: if, that is, He is Himself baptized in 
water; inaugurates in water the first rudimentary displays of His power, when 
invited to the nuptials; invites the thirsty, when He makes a discourse, to His 
own sempiternal water; approves,when teaching concerning love, among works of 
charity, the cup of water offered to a poor (child); recruits His strength at a 
well; walks over the water; willingly crosses the sea; ministers water to His 
disciples. Onward even to the passion does the witness of baptism last: while He 
is being surrendered to the cross, water intervenes; witness Pilate's hands: 
when He is wounded, forth from His side bursts water; witness the soldier's 
lance! 
CHAP. X.--OF JOHN'S BAPTISM.
We have spoken, so far as our moderate ability permitted, of the generals 
which form the groundwork of the sanctity of baptism. I will now, equally to the 
best of my power, proceed to the rest of its character, touching certain minor 
questions. 
The baptism announced by John formed the subject, even at that time, of a 
question, proposed by the Lord Himself indeed to the Pharisees, whether that 
baptism were heavenly, or truly earthly: about which they were unable to give a 
consistent answer, 674 
inasmuch as they understood not, because they believed not. But we, with but 
as poor a measure of understanding as of faith, are able to determine that that 
baptism was devine indeed, (yet in respect of the command, not in respect of 
efficacy too, in that we read that John was sent by the lord to perform this 
duty,) but human in its nature: for it conveyed nothing celestial, but it 
fore-ministered to things celestial; being, to wit, appointed over repentance, 
which is in man's power. In fact, the doctors of the law and the Pharisees, who 
were unwilling to "believe," did not "repent" either. But if repentance is a 
thing human, its baptism must necessarily be of the same nature: else, if it had 
been celestial, it would have given both the Holy Spirit and remission of sins. 
But none either pardons sins or freely grants the Spirit save God only. Even the 
Lord Himself said that the Spirit would not descend on any other condition, but 
that He should first ascend to the Father. What the Lord was not yet conferring, 
of course the servant could not furnish. Accordingly, in the Acts of the 
Apostles, we find that men who had "John's baptism" had not received the Holy 
Spirit, whom they knew not even by hearing. That, then, was no celestial thing 
which furnished no celestial (endowments): whereas the very thing which was 
celestial in John--the Spirit of prophecy--so completely failed, after the 
transfer of the whole Spirit to the Lord, that he presently sent to inquire 
whether He whom he had himself preached, whom he had pointed out when coming to 
him, were "'HE." And so "the baptism of repentance" was dealt with as if it were 
a candidate for the remission and sanctification shortly about to follow in 
Christ: for in that John used to preach "baptism for the remission of sins," the 
declaration was made with reference to future remission; if it be true, (as it 
is,) that repentance is antecedent, remission subsequent; and this is "preparing 
the way." But he who "prepares" does not himself "perfect," but procures for 
another to perfect. John himself professes that the celestial things are not 
his, but Christ's, by saying, "He who is from the earth speaketh concerning the 
earth; He who comes from the realms above is above all;" and again, by saying 
that he "baptized in repentance only, but that One would shortly come who would 
baptize in the Spirit and fire;"--of course because true and stable faith is 
baptized with water, unto salvation; pretended and weak faith is baptized with 
fire, unto judgment. 
CHAP. XI.--ANSWER TO THE OBJECTION THAT "THE LORD DID NOT BAPTIZE."
"But behold, "say some, "the Lord came, and baptized not; for we read, ' 
And yet He used not to baptize, but His disciples! ' " As if, in truth, John 
had preached that He would baptize with His own hands! Of course, his words are 
not so to be understood, but as simply spoken after an ordinary manner; just as, 
for instance, we say, "The emperor set forth an edict," or, "The prefect 
cudgelled him." Pray does the emperor in person set forth, or the prefect in 
person cudgel? One whose ministers do a thing is always said to do it. So "He 
will baptize you" will have to be understood as standing for, "Through Him," or" 
Into Him," "you will be baptized." But let not (the fact) that "He Himself 
baptized not" trouble any. For into whom should He baptize? Into repentance? Of 
what use, then, do you make His forerunner? Into remission of sins, which He 
used to give by a word? Into Himself, whom by humility He was concealing? Into 
the Holy Spirit, who had not yet descended from the Father? Into the Church, 
which His apostles had not yet founded? And thus it was with the selfsame 
"baptism of John" that His disciples used to baptize, as ministers, with which 
John before had baptized as forerunner. Let none think it was with some other, 
because no other exists, except that of Christ subsequently; which at that time, 
of course, could not be given by His disciples, inasmuch as the glory of the 
Lord had not yet been fully attained, nor the efficacy of the font established 
through the passion and the resurrection; because neither can our death see 
dissolution except by the Lord's passion, nor our life be restored without His 
resurrection. 
CHAP. XII.--OF THE NECESSITY OF BAPTISM TO SALVATION.
When, however, the prescript is laid down that "without baptism, salvation is 
attainable 675 
by none" (chiefly on the ground of that declaration of the Lord, who says, 
"Unless one be born of water, he hath not life"), there arise immediately 
scrupulous, nay rather audacious, doubts on the part of some, "how, in 
accordance with that prescript, salvation is attainable by the apostles, 
whom--Paul excepted-we do not find baptized in the Lord? Nay, since Paul is the 
only one of them who has put on the garment of Christ's baptism, either the 
peril of all the others who lack the water of Christ is prejudged, that the 
prescript may be maintained, or else the prescript is rescinded if salvation has 
been ordained even for the unbaptized." I have heard--the Lord is my 
witness--doubts of that kind: that none may imagine me so abandoned as to 
ex-cogitate, unprovoked, in the licence of my pen, ideas which would inspire 
others with scruple. 
And now, as far as I shall be able, I will reply to them who affirm "that the 
apostles were unbaptized." For if they had undergone the human baptism of John, 
and were longing for that of the Lord, then since the Lord Himself had defined 
baptism to be one; (saying to Peter, who was desirous of being thoroughly 
bathed, "He who hath once bathed hath no necessity to wash a second time;" 
which, of course, He would not have said at all to one not baptized;) even here 
we have a conspicuous proof against those who, in order to destroy the sacrament 
of water, deprive the apostles even of John's baptism. Can it seem credible that 
"the way of the Lord," that is, the baptism of John, had not then been "prepared 
"in those persons who were being destined to often the way of the Lord 
throughout the whole world? The Lord Himself, though no "repentance" was due 
from Him, was baptized: was baptism not necessary for sinners? As for the fact, 
then, that "others were not baptized"--they, however, were not companions of 
Christ, but enemies of the faith, doctors of the law and Pharisees. From which 
fact is gathered an additional suggestion, that, since the opposers of the Lord 
refused to be baptized, they who followed the Lord were baptized, and were not 
like-minded with their own rivals: especially when, if there were any one to 
whom they clare, the Lord had exalted John above him (by the testimony) saying," 
Among them who are born of women there is none greater than John the Baptist." 
Others make the suggestion (forced enough, clearly "that the apostles then 
served the turn of baptism whenin their little ship, were sprinkled and covered 
with the waves: that Peter himself also was immersed enough when he walked on 
the sea." It is, however, as I think, one thing to be sprinkled or intercepted 
by the violence of the sea; another thing to be baptized in obedience to the 
discipline of religion. But that little ship did present a figure of the Church, 
in that she is disquieted "in the sea," that is, in the world, "by the waves," 
that is, by persecutions and temptations; the Lord, through patience, sleeping 
as it were, until, roused in their last extremities by the prayers of the 
saints, He checks the world, and restores tranquillity to His own. 
Now, whether they were baptized in any manner whatever, or whether they 
continued unbathed to the end--so that even that saying of the Lord touching the 
"one bath" does, under the person of Peter, merely regard us--still, to 
determine concerning the salvation of the apostles is audacious enough, because 
on them the prerogative even of first choice, and thereafter of undivided 
intimacy, might be able to confer the compendious grace of baptism, seeing they 
(I think) followed Him who was wont to promise salvation to every believer. "Thy 
faith," He would say, "hath saved thee;" and, "Thy sins shall be remitted thee," 
on thy believing, of course, albeit thou be not yet baptized. If that was 
wanting to the apostles, I know not in the faith of what things it was, that, 
roused by one word of the Lord, one left the toll-booth behind for ever; another 
deserted father and ship, and the craft by which he gained his living; a third, 
who disdained his father's obsequies, fulfilled, before he heard it, that 
highest precept of the Lord, "He who prefers father or mother to me, is not 
worthy of me." 
CHAP. XIII.--ANOTHER OBJECTION: ABRAHAM PLEASED GOD WITHOUT BEING
BAPTIZED. ANSWER THERETO. OLD THINGS MUST GIVE PLACE TO NEW, AND 
BAPTISM IS NOW A LAW.
Here, then, those miscreants provoke 676 
questions. And so they say, "Baptism is not necessary for them to whom faith 
is sufficient; for withal, Abraham pleased God by a sacrament of no water, but 
of faith." But in all cases it is the later things which have a conclusive 
force, and the subsequent which prevail over the antecedent. Grant that, in days 
gone by, there was salvation by means of bare faith, before the passion and 
resurrection of the Lord. But now that faith has been enlarged, and is become a 
faith which believes in His nativity, passion, and resurrection, there has been 
an amplification added w the sacrament, viz., the sealing act of baptism; the 
clothing, in some sense, of the faith which before was bare, and which cannot 
exist now without its proper law. For the law of baptizing has been imposed, and 
the formula prescribed: "Go," He saith, "teach the nations, baptizing them into 
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." The comparison 
with this law of that definition, "Unless a man have been reborn of water and 
Spirit, he shall not enter into the kingdom of the heavens," has tied faith to 
the necessity of baptism. 
Accordingly, all thereafter who became believers used to be baptized. Then it 
was, too, that Paul, when he believed, was baptized; and this is the meaning of 
the precept which the Lord had given him when smitten with the plague of loss of 
sight, saying, "Arise, and enter Damascus; there shall be demonstrated to thee 
what thou oughtest to do," to wit--be baptized, which was the only thing lacking 
to him. That point excepted, he bad sufficiently learnt and believed "the 
Nazarene" to be "the Lord, the Son of God." 
CHAP.XIV.--OF PAUL'S ASSERTION, THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN SENT TO 
BAPTIZE.
But they roll back an objection from that apostle himself, in that he said, 
"For Christ sent me not to baptize;", as if by this argument baptism were done 
away! For if so, why did he baptize Gaius, and Crispus, and the house of 
Stephanas? However, even if Christ had not sent him to baptize, yet He had given 
other apostles the precept to baptize. But these words were written to the 
Corinthians in regard of the circumstances of that particular time; seeing that 
schisms and dissensions were agitated among them, while one attributes 
everything to Paul, another to Apollos. For which reason the "peace-making" 
apostle, for fear he should seem to claim all gifts for himself, says that he 
had been sent "not to baptize, but to preach." For preaching is the prior thing, 
baptizing the posterior. Therefore the preaching came first: but I think 
baptizing withal was lawful to him to whom preaching was. 
CHAP.XV.--UNITY OF BAPTISM. REMARKS ON HERETICAL ANY JEWISH 
BAPTISM.
I know not whether any further point is mooted to bring baptism into 
controversy. Permit me to call to mind what I have omitted above, lest I seem to 
break off the train of impending thoughts in the middle. There is to us one, and 
but one, baptism; as well according to the Lord's gospel as according to the 
apostle's letters, inasmuch as he says, "One God, and one baptism, and one 
church in the heavens." But it must be admitted that the question, "What rules 
are to be observed with regard to heretics?" is worthy of being treated. For it 
is to us that that assertion refers. Heretics, however, have no fellowship in 
our discipline, whom the mere fact of their excommunication testifies to be 
outsiders. I am not bound to recognize in them a thing which is enjoined on me, 
because they and we have not the same God, nor one--that is, the same--Christ. 
And therefore their baptism is not one with ours either, because it is not the 
same; a baptism which, since they have it not duly, doubtless they have not at 
all; nor is that capable of being counted which is not had. Thus they cannot 
receive it either, because they have it not. But this point has already received 
a fuller discussion from us in Greek. We enter, then, the font once are sins 
washed away, because they ought never to be repeated. But the Jewish Israel 
bathes daily, because he is daily being defiled: and, for fear that defilement 
should be practised among us also, therefore was the definition touching the one 
bathing made. Happy water, which once washes away; which does not mock sinners 
(with vain hopes); which does not, by 677 
being infected with the repetition of impurities, again defile them whom it 
has washed! 
CHAP, XVI.--OF THE SECOND BAPTISM--WITH BLOOD.
We have indeed, likewise, a second font, (itself withal one with the former,) 
of blood, to wit; concerning which the Lord said, "I have to be baptized with a 
baptism," when He had been baptized already. For He had come "by means of water 
and blood," just as John has written; that He might be baptized by the water, 
glorified by the blood; to make us, in like manner, called by water, chosen by 
blood. These two baptisms He sent out from the wound in His pierced side, in 
order that they who believed in His blood might be bathed with the water; they 
who had been bathed in the water might likewise drink the blood. This is the 
baptism which both stands in lieu of the fontal bathing when that has not been 
received, and restores it when lost. 
CHAP. XVII.--OF THE POWER OF CONFERRING BAPTISM.
For concluding our brief subject, it remains to put you in mind also of the 
due observance of giving and receiving baptism. Of giving it, the chief priest 
(who is the bishop) has the right: in the next place, the presbyters and 
deacons, yet not without the bishop's authority, on account of the honour of the 
Church, which being preserved, peace is preserved. Beside these, even laymen 
have the right; for what is equally received can be equally given. Unless 
bishops, or priests, or deacons, be on the spot, ether disciples are called i.e. 
to the work. The word of the Lord ought not to be hidden by any: in like manner, 
too, baptism, which is equally God's property, can be administered by all. But 
how much more is the rule of reverence and modesty incumbent on laymen--seeing 
that these powers belong to their superiors--lest they assume to themselves the 
specific function of the bishop! Emulation of the episcopal office is the mother 
of schisms. The most holy apostle has said, that "all things are lawful, but not 
all expedient." Let it suffice assuredly, in cases of necessity, to avail 
yourself (of that rule's), if at any time circumstance either of place, or of 
time, or of person compels you (so to do); for then the stedfast courage of the 
succourer, when the situation of the endangered one is urgent, is exceptionally 
admissible; inasmuch as he will be guilty of a human creature's loss if he shall 
refrain from bestowing what he had free liberty to bestow. 
But the woman of pertness, who has usurped the power to teach, will of course 
not give birth for herself likewise to a right of baptizing, unless some new 
beast shall arise like the former; so that, just as the one abolished baptism, 
so some other should in her own right confer it! But if the writings which 
wrongly go under Paul's name, claim Thecla's example as a licence for women's 
teaching and baptizing, let them know that, in Asia, the presbyter who composed 
that writing, as if he were augmenting Paul's fame from his own store, after 
being convicted, and confessing that he had done it from love of Paul, was 
removed from his office. For how credible would it seem, that he who has not 
permitted a woman even to learn with over-boldness, should give a female the 
power of teaching and of baptizing! "Let them be silent," he says, "and at home 
consult their own husbands." 
CHAP. XVIII.--OF THE PERSONS TO WHOM, AND THE TIME WHEN, BAPTISM IS 
TO BE ADMINISTERED.
But they whose office it is, know that baptism is not rashly to be 
administered. "Give to every one who beggeth thee," has a reference of its own, 
appertaining especially to almsgiving. On the contrary, this precept is rather 
to be looked at carefully: "Give not the holy thing to the dogs, nor cast your 
pearls before swine;" and, "Lay not hands easily on any; share not other men's 
sins." If Philip so "easily" baptized the chamberlain, let us reflect that a 
manifest and conspicuous evidence that the Lord deemed him worthy 678 
had been interposed. The Spirit had enjoined Philip to proceed to that road: 
the eunuch himself, too, was not found idle, nor as one who was suddenly seized 
with an eager desire to be baptized; but, after going up to the temple for 
prayer's sake, being intently engaged on the divine Scripture, was thus suitably 
discovered--to whom God had, unasked, sent an apostle, which one, again, the 
Spirit bade adjoin himself to the chamberlain's chariot. The Scripture which he 
was reading falls in opportunely with his faith: Philip, being requested, is 
taken to sit beside him; the Lord is pointed out; faith lingers not; water needs 
no waiting for; the work is completed, and the apostle snatched away. "But Paul 
too was, in fact, 'speedily' baptized:" for Simon, his host, speedily recognized 
him to be "an appointed vessel of election." God's approbation sends sure 
premonitory tokens before it; every "petition " may both deceive and be 
deceived. And so, according to the circumstances and disposition, and even age, 
of each individual, the delay of baptism is preferable; principally, however, in 
the case of little children. 
For why is it necessary--if (baptism itself) is not so necessary--that the 
sponsors likewise should be thrust into danger? Who both themselves, by reason 
of mortality, may fail to fulfil their promises, and may be disappointed by the 
development of an evil disposition, in those for whom they stood? The Lord does 
indeed say, "Forbid them not to come unto me." Let them "come," then, while they 
are growing up; let them "come" while they are learning, while they are learning 
whither to come; let them become Christians when they have become able to know 
Christ. Why does the innocent period of life hasten to the "remission of sins?" 
More caution will be exercised in worldly matters: so that one who is not 
trusted with earthly substance is trusted with divine! 
Let them know how to "ask" for salvation, that you may seem (at least) to 
have given "to him that asketh." For no less cause must the unwedded also be 
deferred--in whom the ground of temptation is prepared, alike in such as never 
were wedded by means of their maturity, and in the widowed by means of their 
freedom--until they either marry, or else be more fully strengthened for 
continence. If any understand the weighty import of baptism, they will fear its 
reception more than its delay: sound faith is secure of salvation. 
CHAP. XIX.--OF THE TIMES MOST SUITABLE FOR BAPTISM.
The Passover affords a more than usually solemn day for baptism; when, 
withal, the Lord's passion, in which we are baptized, was completed. Nor will it 
be incongruous to interpret figuratively the fact that, when the Lord was about 
to celebrate the last Passover, He said to the disciples who were sent to make 
preparation, "Ye will meet a man bearing water." He points out the place for 
celebrating the Passover by the sign of water. After that, Pentecost is a most 
joyous space for conferring baptisms; wherein, too, the resurrection of the Lord 
was repeatedly proved among the disciples, and the hope of the advent of the 
Lord indirectly pointed to, in that, at that time, when He had been received 
back into the heavens, the angels told the apostles that "He would so come, as 
He had withal ascended into the heavens;" at Pentecost, of course. But, 
moreover, when Jeremiah says, "And I will gather them together from the 
extremities of the land in the feast-day," he signifies the day of the Passover 
and of Pentecost, which is properly a "feast-day." However, every day is the 
Lord's; every hour, every time, is apt for baptism: if there is a difference in 
the solemnity, distinction there is none in the grace. 
CHAP. XX.--OF PREPARATION FOR, AND CONDUCT AFTER, THE RECEPTION 
OF BAPTISM.
They who are about to enter baptism ought to pray with repeated prayers, 
fasts, and bendings of the knee, and vigils all the night through, and with the 
confession of all by 679 
gone sins, that they may express the meaning even of the baptism of John: 
"They were baptized," saith (the Scripture), "confessing their own sins." To us 
it is matter for thankfulness if we do now publicly confess our iniquities or 
our turpitudes: for we do at the same time both make satisfaction for our former 
sins, by mortification of our flesh and spirit, and lay beforehand the 
foundation of defences against the temptations which will closely follow. "Watch 
and pray," saith (the Lord), "lest ye fall into temptation." And the reason, I 
believe, why they were tempted was, that they fell asleep; so that they deserted 
the Lord when apprehended, and he who continued to stand by Him, and used the 
sword, even denied Him thrice: for withal the word had gone before, that "no one 
untempted should attain the celestial kingdoms." The Lord Himself forthwith 
after baptism temptations surrounded, when in forty days He had kept fast. 
"Then," some one will say," it becomes us, too, rather to fast after baptism." 
Well, and who forbids you, unless it be the necessity for joy, and the 
thanksgiving for salvation? But so far as I, with my poor powers, understand, 
the Lord figuratively retorted upon Israel the reproach they had east an the 
Lord. For the people, after crossing the sea, and being carried about in the 
desert during forty years, although they were there nourished with divine 
supplies, nevertheless were more mindful of their belly and their gullet than of 
God. Thereupon the Lord, driven apart into desert places after baptism, showed, 
by maintaining a fast of forty days, that the man of God lives "not by bread 
alone," but "by the word of God;" and that temptations incident to fulness or 
immoderation of appetite are shattered by abstinence. Therefore, blessed ones, 
whom the grace of God awaits, when you ascend from that most sacred font of your 
new birth, and spread your hands for the first time in the house of your mother, 
together with your brethren, ask from the Father, ask from the Lord, that His 
own specialties of grace and distributions of gifts may be supplied you. "Ask," 
saith He, "and ye shall receive." Well, you have asked, and have received; you 
have knocked, and it has been opened to you. Only, I pray that, when you are 
asking, you be mindful likewise of Tertullian the sinner.
