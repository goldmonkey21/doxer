Irenaeus of Lyons












Book III.
--------

Preface.
Thou hast indeed enjoined upon me, my very dear friend, that I should bring 
to light the Valentinian doctrines, concealed, as their votaries imagine; that I 
should exhibit their diversity, and compose a treatise in refutation of them. 
therefore have undertaken-showing that they spring from Simon, the father of all 
heretics-to exhibit both their doctrines and successions, and to set forth 
arguments against them all. Wherefore, since the conviction of these men and 
their exposure is in many points but one work, I have sent unto thee [certain] 
books, of which the first comprises the opinions of all these men, and exhibits 
their customs, and the character of their behaviour. In the second, again, their 
perverse teachings are cast down and overthrown, and, such as they really are, 
laid bare and open to view. But in this, the third book I shall adduce proofs 
from the Scriptures, so that I may come behind in nothing of what thou hast 
enjoined; yea, that over and above what thou didst reckon upon, thou mayest 
receive from me the means of combating and vanquishing those who, in whatever 
manner, are propagating falsehood. For the love of God, being rich and 
ungrudging, confers upon the suppliant more than he can ask from it. Call to 
mind then, the things which I have stated in the two preceding books, and, 
taking these in connection with them, thou shalt have from me a very copious 
refutation of all the heretics; and faithfully and strenuously shalt thou resist 
them in defence of the only true and life-giving faith, which the Church has 
received from the apostles and imparted to her sons. For the Lord of all gave to 
His apostles the power of the Gospel, through whom also we have known the truth, 
that is, the doctrine of the Son of God; to whom also did the Lord declare: "He 
that heareth you, heareth Me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth Me, and Him 
that sent Me."


Chapter I.-The Apostles Did Not 
  Commence to Preach the Gospel, or to Place Anything on Record, Until They Were 
  Endowed with the Gifts and Power of the Holy Spirit. They Preached One God 
  Alone, Maker of Heaven and Earth.
1. WE have learned from none others the plan of our salvation, than from 
those through whom the Gospel has come down to us, which they did at one time 
proclaim in public, and, at a later period, by the will of God, handed down to 
us in the Scriptures, to be the ground and pillar of our faith. 
For it is unlawful to assert that they preached before they possessed "perfect 
knowledge," as some do even venture to say, boasting themselves as improvers of 
the apostles. For, after our Lord rose from the dead, [the apostles] were 
invested with power from on high when the Holy Spirit came down [upon them], 
were filled from all [His gifts], and had perfect knowledge: they departed to 
the ends of the earth, preaching the glad tidings of the good things [sent] from 
God to us, and proclaiming the peace of heaven to men, who indeed do all equally 
and individually possess the Gospel of God. Matthew also issued a written Gospel 
among the Hebrews
in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying 
the foundations of the Church. After their departure, Mark, the disciple and 
interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached 
by Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel 
preached by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned 
upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in 
Asia.
2. These have all declared to us that there is one God, Creator of heaven and 
earth, announced by the law and the prophets; and one Christ the Son of God. If 
any one do not agree to these truths, he despises the companions of the Lord; 
nay more, he despises Christ Himself the Lord; yea, he despises the Father also, 
and stands self-condemned, resisting and opposing his own salvation, as is the 
case with all heretics.

Chapter II.-The Heretics Follow 
  Neither Scripture Nor Tradition.
1. When, however, they are confuted from the Scriptures, they turn round and 
accuse these same Scriptures, as if they were not correct, nor of authority, and 
[assert] that they are ambiguous, and that the truth cannot be extracted from 
them by those who are ignorant of tradition. For [they allege] that the truth 
was not delivered by means of written documents, but viv√¢ voce: wherefore 
also Paul declared, "But we speak wisdom among those that are perfect, but not 
the wisdom of this world."
And this wisdom each one of them alleges to be the fiction of his own inventing, 
forsooth; so that, according to their idea, the truth properly resides at one 
time in Valentinus, at another in Marcion, at another in Cerinthus, then 
afterwards in Basilides, or has even been indifferently in any other 
opponent,
who could speak nothing pertaining to salvation. For every one of these men, 
being altogether of a perverse disposition, depraving the system of truth, is 
not ashamed to preach himself.
2. But, again, when we refer them to that tradition which originates from the 
apostles, [and] which is preserved by means of the succession of presbyters in 
the Churches, they object to tradition, saying that they themselves are wiser 
not merely than the presbyters, but even than the apostles, because they have 
discovered the unadulterated truth. For [they maintain] that the apostles 
intermingled the things of the law with the words of the Saviour; and that not 
the apostles alone, but even the Lord Himself, spoke as at one time from the 
Demiurge, at another from the intermediate place, and yet again from the 
Pleroma, but that they themselves, indubitably, unsulliedly, and purely, have 
knowledge of the hidden mystery: this is, indeed, to blaspheme their Creator 
after a most impudent manner! It comes to this, therefore, that these men do now 
consent neither to Scripture nor to tradition.
3. Such are the adversaries with whom we have to deal, my very dear friend, 
endeavouring like slippery serpents to escape at all points. Where-fore they 
must be opposed at all points, if per-chance, by cutting off their retreat, we 
may succeed in turning them back to the truth. For, though it is not an easy 
thing for a soul under the influence of error to repent, yet, on the other hand, 
it is not altogether impossible to escape from error when the truth is brought 
alongside it.

Chapter III.-A Refutation of the 
  Heretics, from the Fact That, in the Various Churches, a Perpetual Succession 
  of Bishops Was Kept Up.
1. It is within the power of all, therefore, in every Church, who may wish to 
see the truth, to contemplate clearly the tradition of the apostles manifested 
throughout the whole world; and we are in a position to reckon up those who were 
by the apostles instituted bishops in the Churches, and [to demonstrate] the 
succession of these men to our own times; those who neither taught nor knew of 
anything like what these [heretics] rave about. For if the apostles had known 
hidden mysteries, which they were in the habit of imparting to "the perfect" 
apart and privily from the rest, they would have delivered them especially to 
those to whom they were also committing the Churches themselves. For they were 
desirous that these men should be very perfect and blameless in all things, whom 
also they were leaving behind as their successors, delivering up their own place 
of government to these men; which men, if they discharged their functions 
honestly, would be a great boon [to the Church], but if they should fall away, 
the direst calamity.
2. Since, however, it would be very tedious, in such a volume as this, to 
reckon up the successions of all the Churches, we do put to confusion all those 
who, in whatever manner, whether by an evil self-pleasing, by vainglory, or by 
blindness and perverse opinion, assemble in unauthorized meetings; [we do this, 
I say, ] by indicating that tradition derived from the apostles, of the very 
great, the very ancient, and universally known Church founded and organized at 
Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul; as also [by pointing 
out] the faith preached to men, which comes down to our time by means of the 
successions of the bishops. For it is a matter of necessity that every Church 
should agree with this Church, on account of its pre- eminent authority, 
that is, the faithful everywhere, inasmuch as the apostolical tradition has been 
preserved continuously by those [faithful men] who exist everywhere.
3. The blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church, 
committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate. Of this Linus, 
Paul makes mention in the Epistles to Timothy. To him succeeded Anacletus; and 
after him, in the third place from the apostles, Clement was allotted the 
bishopric. This man, as he had seen the blessed apostles, and had been 
conversant with them, might be said to have the preaching of the apostles still 
echoing [in his ears], and their traditions before his eyes. Nor was he alone 
[in this], for there were many still remaining who had received instructions 
from the apostles. In the time of this Clement, no small dissension having 
occurred among the brethren at Corinth, the Church in Rome despatched a most 
powerful letter to the Corinthians, exhorting them to peace, renewing their 
faith, and declaring the tradition which it had lately received from the 
apostles, proclaiming the one God, omnipotent, the Maker of heaven and earth, 
the Creator of man, who brought on the deluge, and called Abraham, who led the 
people from the land of Egypt, spake with Moses, set forth the law, sent the 
prophets, and who has prepared fire for the devil and his angels. From this 
document, whosoever chooses to do so, may learn that He, the Father of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, was preached by the Churches, and may also understand the 
apostolical tradition of the Church, since this Epistle is of older date than 
these men who are now propagating falsehood, and who conjure into existence 
another god beyond the Creator and the Maker of all existing things. To this 
Clement there succeeded Evaristus. Alexander followed Evaristus; then, sixth 
from the apostles, Sixtus was appointed; after him, Telephorus, who was 
gloriously martyred; then Hyginus; after him, Pius; then after him, Anicetus. 
Sorer having succeeded Anicetus, Eleutherius does now, in the twelfth place from 
the apostles, hold the inheritance of the episcopate. In this order, and by this 
succession, the ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles, and the preaching of 
the truth, have come down to us. And this is most abundant proof that there is 
one and the same vivifying faith, which has been preserved in the Church from 
the apostles until now, and handed down in truth.
4. But Polycarp also was not only instructed by apostles, and conversed with 
many who had seen Christ, but was also, by apostles in Asia, appointed bishop of 
the Church in Smyrna, whom I also saw in my early youth, for he tarried [on 
earth] a very long time, and, when a very old man, gloriously and most nobly 
suffering martyrdom,
departed this life, having always taught the things which he had learned from 
the apostles, and which the Church has handed down, and which alone are true. To 
these things all the Asiatic Churches testify, as do also those men who have 
succeeded Polycarp down to the present time,-a man who was of much greater 
weight, and a more stedfast witness of truth, than Valentinus, and Marcion, and 
the rest of the heretics. He it was who, coming to Rome in the time of Anicetus 
caused many to turn away from the aforesaid heretics to the Church of God, 
proclaiming that he had received this one and sole truth from the 
apostles,-that, namely, which is handed down by the Church. 
There are also those who heard from him that John, the disciple of the Lord, 
going to bathe at Ephesus, and perceiving Cerinthus within, rushed out of the 
bath-house without bathing, exclaiming, "Let us fly, lest even the bath-house 
fall down, because Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, is within." And Polycarp 
himself replied to Marcion, who met him on one occasion, and said, "Dost thou 
know me? ""I do know thee, the first-born of Satan." Such was the horror which 
the apostles and their disciples had against holding even verbal communication 
with any corrupters of the truth; as Paul also says, "A man that is an heretic, 
after the first and second admonition, reject; knowing that he that is such is 
subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself." 
There is also a very powerful
Epistle of Polycarp written to the Philippians, from which those who choose to 
do so, and are anxious about their salvation, can learn the character of his 
faith, and the preaching of the truth. Then, again, the Church in Ephesus, 
founded by Paul, and having John remaining among them permanently until the 
times of Trajan, is a true witness of the tradition of the apostles.

Chapter IV.-The Truth is to Be Found 
  Nowhere Else But in the Catholic Church, the Sole Depository of Apostolical 
  Doctrine. Heresies are of Recent Formation, and Cannot Trace Their Origin Up 
  to the Apostles.
1. Since therefore we have such proofs, it is not necessary to seek the truth 
among others which it is easy to obtain from the Church; since the apostles, 
like a rich man [depositing his money] in a bank, lodged in her hands most 
copiously all things pertaining to the truth: so that every man, whosoever will, 
can draw from her the water of life.
For she is the entrance to life; all others are thieves and robbers. On this 
account are we bound to avoid them, but to make choice of the thing 
pertaining to the Church with the utmost diligence, and to lay hold of the 
tradition of the truth. For how stands the case? Suppose there arise a dispute 
relative to some important question
among us, should we not have recourse to the most ancient Churches with which 
the apostles held constant intercourse, and learn from them what is certain and 
clear in regard to the present question? For how should it be if the apostles 
themselves had not left us writings? Would it not be necessary, [in that case,] 
to follow the course of the tradition which they handed down to those to whom 
they did commit the Churches?
2. To which course many nations of those barbarians who believe in Christ do 
assent, having salvation written in their hearts by the Spirit, without paper or 
ink, and, carefully preserving the ancient tradition,
believing in one God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and all things therein, 
by means of Christ Jesus, the Son of God; who, because of His surpassing love 
towards His creation, condescended to be born of the virgin, He Himself uniting 
man through Himself to God, and having suffered under Pontius Pilate, and rising 
again, and having been received up in splendour, shall come in glory, the 
Saviour of those who are saved, and the Judge of those who are judged, and 
sending into eternal fire those who transform the truth, and despise His Father 
and His advent. Those who, in the absence of written documents, 
have believed this faith, are barbarians, so far as regards our language; but as 
regards doctrine, manner, and tenor of life, they are, because of faith, very 
wise indeed; and they do please God, ordering their conversation in all 
righteousness, chastity, and wisdom. If any one were to preach to these men the 
inventions of the heretics, speaking to them in their own language, they would 
at once stop their ears, and flee as far off as possible, not enduring even to 
listen to the blasphemous address. Thus, by means of that ancient tradition of 
the apostles, they do not suffer their mind to conceive anything of the 
[doctrines suggested by the] portentous language of these teachers, among whom 
neither Church nor doctrine has ever been established.
3. For, prior to Valentinus, those who follow Valentinus had no existence; 
nor did those from Marcion exist before Marcion; nor, in short, had any of those 
malignant-minded people, whom I have above enumerated, any being previous to the 
initiators and inventors of their perversity. For Valentinus came to Rome in the 
time of Hyginus, flourished under Pius, and remained until Anicetus. Cerdon, 
too, Marcion's predecessor, himself arrived in the time of Hyginus, who was the 
ninth bishop. 
Coming frequently into the Church, and making public confession, he thus 
remained, one time teaching in secret, and then again making public confession; 
but at last, having been denounced for corrupt teaching, he was 
excommunicated
from the assembly of the brethren. Marcion, then, succeeding him, flourished 
under Anicetus, who held the tenth place of the episcopate. But the rest, who 
are called Gnostics, take rise from Menander, Simon's disciple, as I have shown; 
and each one of them appeared to be both the father and the high priest of that 
doctrine into which he has been initiated. But all these (the Marcosians) broke 
out into their apostasy much later, even during the intermediate period of the 
Church.

Chapter V.-Christ and His Apostles, 
  Without Any Fraud, Deception, or Hypocrisy, Preached that One God, the Father, 
  Was the Founder of All Things. They Did Not Accommodate Their Doctrineto the 
  Prepossessions of Their Hearers.
1. Since, therefore, the tradition from the apostles does thus exist in the 
Church, and is permanent among us, let us revert to the Scrip-rural proof 
furnished by those apostles who did also write the Gospel, in which they 
recorded the doctrine regarding God, pointing out that our Lord Jesus Christ is 
the truth,
and that no lie is in Him. As also David says, prophesying His birth from a 
virgin, and the resurrection from the dead, "Truth has sprung out of the 
earth." 
The apostles, likewise, being disciples of the truth, are above all falsehood; 
for a lie has no fellowship with the truth, just as darkness has none with 
light, but the presence of the one shuts out that of the other. Our Lord, 
therefore, being the truth, did not speak lies; and whom He knew to have taken 
origin from a de-feet, He never would have acknowledged as God, even the God of 
all, the Supreme King, too, and His own Father, an imperfect being as a perfect 
one, an animal one as a spiritual, Him who was without the Pleroma as Him who 
was within it. Neither did His disciples make mention of any other God, or term 
any other Lord, except Him, who was truly the God and Lord of all, as these most 
vain sophists affirm that the apostles did with hypocrisy frame their doctrine 
according to the capacity of their hearers, and gave answers after the opinions 
of their questioners,-fabling blind things for the blind, according to their 
blindness; for the dull according to their dulness; for those in error according 
to their error. And to those who imagined that the Demiurge alone was God, they 
preached him; but to those who are capable of comprehending the unnameable 
Father, they did declare the unspeakable mystery through parables and enigmas: 
so that the Lord and the apostles exercised the office of teacher not to further 
the cause of truth, but even in hypocrisy, and as each individual was able to 
receive it!
5. Such [a line of conduct] belongs not to those who heal, or who give life: 
it is rather that of those bringing on diseases, and increasing ignorance; and 
much more true than these men shall the law be found, which pronounces every one 
accursed who sends the blind man astray in the way. For the apostles, who were 
commissioned to find out the wanderers, and to be for sight to those who saw 
not, and medicine to the weak, certainly did not address them in accordance with 
their opinion at the time, but according to revealed truth. For no persons of 
any kind would act properly, if they should advise blind men, just about to fall 
over a precipice, to continue their most dangerous path, as if it were the right 
one, and as if they might go on in safety. Or what medical man, anxious to heal 
a sick person, would prescribe in accordance with the patient's whims, and not 
according to the requisite medicine? But that the Lord came as the physician of 
the sick, He does Himself declare saying, "They that are whole need not a 
physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners 
to repentance." 
How then shall the sick be strengthened, or how shall sinners come to 
repentance? Is it by persevering in the very same courses? or, on the contrary, 
is it by undergoing a great change and reversal of their former mode of living, 
by which they have brought upon themselves no slight amount of sickness, and 
many sins? But ignorance, the mother of all these, is driven out by knowledge. 
Wherefore the Lord used to impart knowledge to His disciples, by which also it 
was His practice to heal those who were suffering, and to keep back sinners from 
sin. He therefore did not address them in accordance with their pristine 
notions, nor did He reply to them in harmony with the opinion of His 
questioners, but according to the doctrine leading to salvation, without 
hypocrisy or respect of person.
3. This is also made clear from the words of the Lord, who did truly reveal 
the Son of God to those of the circumcision-Him who had been foretold as Christ 
by the prophets; that is, He set Himself forth, who had restored liberty to men, 
and bestowed on them the inheritance of incorruption. And again, the apostles 
taught the Gentiles that they should leave vain stocks and stones, which they 
imagined to be gods, and worship the true God, who had created and made all the 
human family, and, by means of His creation, did nourish, increase, strengthen, 
and preserve them in being; and that they might look for His Son Jesus Christ, 
who redeemed us from apostasy with His own blood, so that we should also be a 
sanctified people,-who shall also descend from heaven in His Father's power, and 
pass judgment upon all, and who shall freely give the good things of God to 
those who shall have kept His commandments. He, appearing in these last times, 
the chief cornerstone, has gathered into one, and united those that were far off 
and those that were near; 
that is, the circumcision and the uncircumcision, enlarging Japhet, and placing 
him in the dwelling of Shem. 


Chapter VI-The Holy Ghost, 
  Throughout the Old Testament Scriptures, Made Mention of No Other God or Lord, 
  Save Him Who is the True God.
1. Therefore neither would the Lord, nor the Holy Spirit, nor the apostles, 
have ever named as God, definitely and absolutely, him who was not God, unless 
he were truly God; nor would they have named any one in his own person Lord, 
except God the Father ruling over all, and His Son who has received dominion 
from His Father over all creation, as this passage has it: "The Lord said unto 
my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy 
footstool." 
Here the [Scripture] represents to us the Father addressing the Son; He who gave 
Him the inheritance of the heathen, and subjected to Him all His enemies. Since, 
therefore, the Father is truly Lord, and the Son truly Lord, the Holy Spirit has 
fitly designated them by the title of Lord. And again, referring to the 
destruction of the Sodomites, the Scripture says, "Then the Lord rained upon 
Sodom and upon Gomorrah fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven." 
For it here points out that the Son, who had also been talking with Abraham, had 
received power to judge the Sodomites for their wickedness. And this [text 
following] does declare the same truth: "Thy throne, O God; is for ever and 
ever; the sceptre of Thy kingdom is a right sceptre. Thou hast loved 
righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed 
Thee." 
For the Spirit designates both [of them] by the name, of God-both Him who is 
anointed as Son, and Him who does anoint, that is, the Father. And again: "God 
stood in the congregation of the gods, He judges among the gods." 
He [here] refers to the Father and the Son, and those who have received the 
adoption; but these are the Church. For she is the synagogue of God, which 
God-that is, the Son Himself-has gathered by Himself. Of whom He again speaks: 
"The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken, and hath called the earth." 
Who is meant by God? He of whom He has said, "God shall come openly, our God, 
and shall not keep silence; " 
that is, the Son, who came manifested to men who said, "I have openly appeared 
to those who seek Me not." 
But of what gods [does he speak]? [Of those] to whom He says, "I have said, Ye 
are gods, and all sons of the Most High." 
To those, no doubt, who have received the grace of the "adoption, by which we 
cry, Abba Father." 

2. Wherefore, as I have already stated, no other is named as God, or is 
called Lord, except Him who is God and Lord of all, who also said to Moses, "I 
AM That I AM. And thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: He who is, hath 
sent me unto you; " 
and His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who makes those that believe in His name the 
sons of God. And again, when the Son speaks to Moses, He says, "I am come down 
to deliver this people." 
For it is He who descended and ascended for the salvation of men. Therefore God 
has been declared through the Son, who is in the Father, and has the Father in 
Himself-He who is, the Father bearing witness to the Son, and the Son announcing 
the Father.-As also Esaias says, "I too am witness," he declares, "saith the 
Lord God, and the Son whom I have chosen, that ye may know, and believe, and 
understand that I am." 

3. When, however, the Scripture terms them [gods] which are no gods, it does 
not, as I have already remarked, declare them as gods in every sense, but with a 
certain addition and signification, by which they are shown to be no gods at 
all. As with David: "The gods of the heathen are idols of demons; " 
and, "Ye shall not follow other gods" 
For in that he says "the gods of the heathen"-but the heathen are ignorant of 
the true God-and calls them "other gods," he bars their claim [to be looked 
upon] as gods at all. But as to what they are in their own person, he speaks 
concerning them; "for they are," he says, "the idols of demons." And Esaias: 
"Let them be confounded, all who blaspheme God, and carve useless things; 
even I am witness, saith God." 
He removes them from [the category of] gods, but he makes use of the word alone, 
for this [purpose], that we may know of whom he speaks. Jeremiah also says the 
same: "The gods that have not made the heavens and earth, let them perish from 
the earth which is under the heaven." 
For, from the fact of his having subjoined their destruction, he shows them to 
be no gods at all. Elias, too, when all Israel was assembled at Mount Carmel, 
wishing to turn them from idolatry, says to them, "How long halt ye between two 
opinions? 
If the Lord be God, 
follow Him." 
And again, at the burnt-offering, he thus addresses the idolatrous priests: "Ye 
shall call upon the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord 
my God; and the Lord that will hearken by fire, 
He is God." Now, from the fact of the prophet having said these words, he proves 
that these gods which were reputed so among those men, are no gods at all. He 
directed them to that God upon whom he believed, and who was truly God; whom 
invoking, he exclaimed, "Lord God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, 
hear me to-day, and let all this people know that Thou art the God of 
Israel." 

4. Wherefore I do also call upon thee, Lord God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, 
and God of Jacob and Israel, who art the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the 
God who, through the abundance of Thy mercy, hast had a favour towards us, that 
we should know Thee, who hast made heaven and earth, who rulest over all, who 
art the only and the true God, above whom there is none other God; grant, by our 
Lord Jesus Christ, the governing power of the Holy Spirit; give to every reader 
of this book to know Thee, that Thou art God alone, to be strengthened in Thee, 
and to avoid every heretical, and godless, and impious doctrine. 
5. And the Apostle Paul also, saying, "For though ye have served them which 
are no gods; ye now know God, or rather, are known of God," 
has made a separation between those that were not [gods] and Him who is God. And 
again, speaking of Antichrist, he says, "who opposeth and exalteth himself above 
all that is called God, or that is worshipped." 
He points out here those who are called gods, by such as know not God, that is, 
idols. For the Father of all is called God, and is so; and Antichrist shall be 
lifted up, not above Him, but above those which are indeed called gods, but are 
not. And Paul himself says that this is true: "We know that an idol is nothing, 
and that there is none other God but one. For though there be that are called 
gods, whether in heaven or in earth; yet to us there is but one God, the Father, 
of whom are all things, and we through Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom 
are all things, and we by Him." 
For he has made a distinction, and separated those which are indeed called gods, 
but which are none, from the one God the Father, from whom are all things, and, 
he has confessed in the most decided manner in his own person, one Lord Jesus 
Christ. But in this [clause], "whether in heaven or in earth," he does not speak 
of the formers of the world, as these [teachers] expound it; but his meaning is 
similar to that of Moses, when it is said, "Thou shalt not make to thyself any 
image for God, of whatsoever things are in heaven above, whatsoever in the earth 
beneath, and whatsoever in the waters under the earth." 
And he does thus explain what are meant by the things in heaven: "Lest when," he 
says, "looking towards heaven, and observing the sun, and the moon, and the 
stars, and all the ornament of heaven, falling into error, thou shouldest adore 
and serve them." 
And Moses himself, being a man of God, was indeed given as a god before 
Pharaoh; 
but he is not properly termed Lord, nor is called God by the prophets, but is 
spoken of by the Spirit as "Moses, the faithful minister and servant of 
God," 
which also he was.

Chapter VII.-Reply to an Objection 
  Founded on the Words of St.paul (2 Corinthians 4:5). St. Paul Occasionally 
  Uses Words Not in Their Grammatical, Sequence.
1. As to their affirming that Paul said plainly in the Second [Epistle] to 
the Corinthians, "In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them 
that believe not," 
and maintaining that there is indeed one god of this world, but another who is 
beyond all principality, and beginning, and power, we are not to blame if they, 
who give out that they do themselves know mysteries beyond God, know not how to 
read Paul. For if any one read the passage thus-according to Paul's custom, as I 
show elsewhere, and by many examples, that he uses transposition of words-"In 
whom God," then pointing it off, and making a slight interval, and at the same 
time read also the rest [of the sentence] in one [clause], "hath blinded the 
minds of them of this world that believe not," he shall find out the true 
[sense]; that it is contained in the expression, "God hath blinded the minds of 
the unbelievers of this world." And this is shown by means of the little 
interval [between the clause]. For Paul does not say, "the God of this world," 
as if recognising any other beyond Him; but he confessed God as indeed God. And 
he says, "the unbelievers of this world," because they shall not inherit the 
future age of incorruption. I shall show from Paul himself, how it is that God 
has blinded the minds of them that believe not, in the course of this work, that 
we may not just at present distract our mind from the matter in hand, [by 
wandering] at large.
2. From many other instances also, we may discover that the apostle 
frequently uses a transposed order in his sentences, due to the rapidity of his 
discourses, and the impetus of the Spirit which is in him. An example occurs in 
the [Epistle] to the Galatians, where he expresses himself as follows: 
"Wherefore then the law of works? 
It was added, until the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it 
was] ordained by angels in the hand of a Mediator." 
For the order of the words runs thus: "Wherefore then the law of works? Ordained 
by angels in the hand of a Mediator, it was added until the seed should come to 
whom the promise was made,"-man thus asking the question, and the Spirit making 
answer. And again, in the Second to the Thessalonians, speaking of Antichrist, 
he says, "And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus 
Christ 
shall slay with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy him 
with the presence of his coming; [even him] whose coming is after the working of 
Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders." 
Now in these [sentences] the order of the words is this: "And then shall be 
revealed that wicked, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all 
power, and signs, and lying wonders, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the 
Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the presence of His coming." For he 
does not mean that the coming of the Lord is after the working of Satan; but the 
coming of the wicked one, whom we also call Antichrist. If, then, one does not 
attend to the [proper] reading [of the passage], and if he do not exhibit the 
intervals of breathing as they occur, there shall be not only incongruities, but 
also, when reading, he will utter blasphemy, as if the advent of the Lord could 
take place according to the working of Satan. So therefore, in such passages, 
the hyperbaton must be exhibited by the reading, and the apostle's 
meaning following on, preserved; and thus we do not read in that passage, "the 
god of this world," but, "God," whom we do truly call God; and we hear [it 
declared of] the unbelieving and the blinded of this world, that they shall not 
inherit the world of life which is to come.

Chapter VIII.-Answer to an 
  Objection, Arising from the Words of Christ (Matt. VI. 24). God Alone is to Be 
  Really Called God and Lord, for He is Without Beginning and End.
1. This calumny, then, of these men, having been quashed, it is clearly 
proved that neither the prophets nor the apostles did ever name another God, or 
call [him] Lord, except the true and only God. Much more [would this be the case 
with regard to] the Lord Himself, who did also direct us to "render unto Caesar 
the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's; " 
naming indeed Caesar as Caesar, but confessing God as God. In like manner also, 
that [text] which says, "Ye cannot serve two masters," 
He does Himself interpret, saying, "Ye cannot serve God and mammon; 
"acknowledging God indeed as God, but mentioning mammon, a thing having also an 
existence. He does not call mammon Lord when He says, "Ye cannot serve two 
masters; "but He teaches His disciples who serve God, not to be subject to 
mammon, nor to be ruled by it. For He says, "He that committeth sin is the slave 
of sin." 
Inasmuch, then, as He terms those "the slaves of sin" who serve sin, but does 
not certainly call sin itself God, thus also He terms those who serve mammon 
"the slaves of mammon," not calling mammon God. For mammon is, according to the 
Jewish language, which the Samaritans do also use, a covetous man, and 
one who wishes to have more than he ought to have. But according to the Hebrew, 
it is by the addition of a syllable (adjunctive) called Mamuel, 
and signifies gulosum, that is, one whose gullet is insatiable. 
Therefore, according to both these things which are indicated, we cannot serve 
God and mammon.
2. But also, when He spoke of the devil as strong, not absolutely so, but as 
in comparison with us, the Lord showed Himself under every aspect and truly to 
be the strong man, saying that one can in no other way "spoil the goods of a 
strong man, if he do not first bind the strong man himself, and then he will 
spoil his house." 
Now we were the vessels and the house of this [strong man] when we were in a 
state of apostasy; for he put us to whatever use he pleased, and the unclean 
spirit dwelt within us. For he was not strong, as opposed to Him who bound him, 
and spoiled his house; but as against those persons who were his tools, inasmuch 
as he caused their thought to wander away from God: these did the Lord snatch 
from his grasp. As also Jeremiah declares, "The Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and 
has snatched him from the hand of him that was stronger than he." 
If, then, he had not pointed out Him who binds and spoils his goods, but had 
merely spoken of him as being strong, the strong man should have been 
unconquered. But he also subjoined Him who obtains and retains possession; for 
he holds who binds, but he is held who is bound. And this he did 
without any comparison, so that, apostate slave as he was, he might not be 
compared to the Lord: for not he alone, but not one of created and subject 
things, shall ever be compared to the Word of God, by whom all things were made, 
who is our Lord Jesus Christ.
3. For that all things, whether Angels, or Archangels, or Thrones, or 
Dominions, were both established and created by Him who is God over all, through 
His Word, John has thus pointed out. For when he had spoken of the Word of God 
as having been in the Father, he added, "All things were made by Him, and 
without Him was not anything made." 
David also, when he had enumerated [His] praises, subjoins by name all things 
whatsoever I have mentioned, both the heavens and all the powers therein: "For 
He commanded, and they were created; He spake, and they were made." Whom, 
therefore, did He command? The Word, no doubt, "by whom," he says, "the heavens 
were established, and all their power by the breath of His mouth." 
But that He did Himself make all things freely, and as He pleased, again David 
says, "But our God is in the heavens above, and in the earth; He hath made all 
things whatsoever He pleased." 
But the things established are distinct from Him who has established them, and 
what have been made from Him who has made them. For He is Himself uncreated, 
both without beginning and end, and lacking nothing. He is Himself sufficient 
for Himself; and still further, He grants to all others this very thing, 
existence; but the things which have been made by Him have received a beginning. 
But whatever things had a beginning, and are liable to dissolution, and are 
subject to and stand in need of Him who made them, must necessarily in all 
respects have a different term [applied to them], even by those who have but a 
moderate capacity for discerning such things; so that He indeed who made all 
things can alone, together with His Word, properly be termed God and Lord: but 
the things which have been made cannot have this term applied to them, neither 
should they justly assume that appellation which belongs to the Creator.

Chapter IX.-One and the Same God, 
  the Creator of Heaven and Earth, is He Whom the Prophets Foretold, and Who Was 
  Declared by the Gospel. Proof of This, at the Outset, from St. Matthew's 
  Gospel.
1. This, therefore, having been clearly demonstrated here (and it shall yet 
be so still more clearly), that neither the prophets, nor the apostles, nor the 
Lord Christ in His own person, did acknowledge any other Lord or God, but the 
God and Lord supreme: the prophets and the apostles confessing the Father and 
the Son; but naming no other as God, and confessing no other as Lord: and the 
Lord Himself handing down to His disciples, that He, the Father, is the only God 
and Lord, who alone is God and ruler of all;-it is incumbent on us to follow, if 
we are their disciples indeed, their testimonies to this effect. For Matthew the 
apostle-knowing, as one and the same God, Him who had given promise to Abraham, 
that He would make his seed as the stars of heaven, 
and Him who, by His Son Christ Jesus, has called us to the knowledge of Himself, 
from the worship of stones, so that those who were not a people were made a 
people, and she beloved who was not beloved 
-declares that John, when preparing the way for Christ, said to those who were 
boasting of their relationship [to Abraham] according to the flesh, but who had 
their mind tinged and stuffed with all manner of evil, preaching that repentance 
which should call them back from their evil doings, said, "O generation of 
vipers, who hath shown you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore 
fruit meet for repentance. And think not to say within yourselves, We have 
Abraham [to our] father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to 
raise up children unto Abraham." 
He preached to them, therefore, the repentance from wickedness, but he did not 
declare to them another God, besides Him who made the promise to Abraham; he, 
the forerunner of Christ, of whom Matthew again says, and Luke likewise, "For 
this is he that was spoken of from the Lord by the prophet, The voice of one 
crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight the 
paths of our God. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill 
brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough into smooth 
ways; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God." 
There is therefore one and the same God, the Father of our Lord, who also 
promised, through the prophets, that He would send His forerunner; and His 
salvation-that is, His Word-He caused to be made visible to all flesh, [the 
Word] Himself being made incarnate, that in all things their King might become 
manifest. For it is necessary that those [beings] which are judged do see the 
judge, and know Him from whom they receive judgment; and it is also proper, that 
those which follow on to glory should know Him who bestows upon them the gift of 
glory.
2. Then again Matthew, when speaking of the angel, says, "The angel of the 
Lord appeared to Joseph in sleep." 
Of what Lord he does himself interpret: "That it may be fulfilled which was 
spoken of the Lord by the prophet, Out of Egypt have I called my son." 
"Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall 
call his name Emmanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us." 
David likewise speaks of Him who, from the virgin, is Emmanuel: "Turn not away 
the face of Thine anointed. The Lord hath sworn a truth to David, and will not 
turn from him. Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy seat." 
And again: "In Judea is God known; His place has been made in peace, and His 
dwelling in Zion." 
Therefore there is one and the same God, who was proclaimed by the prophets and 
announced by the Gospel; and His Son, who was of the fruit of David's body, that 
is, of the virgin of [the house of] David, and Emmanuel; whose star also Balaam 
thus prophesied: "There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a leader shall rise 
in Israel." 
But Matthew says that the Magi, coming from the east, exclaimed "For we have 
seen His star in the east, and are come to worship Him; " 
and that, having been led by the star into the house of Jacob to Emmanuel, they 
showed, by these gifts which they offered, who it was that was worshipped; 
myrrh, because it was He who should die and be buried for the mortal 
human met; gold, because He was a King, "of whose kingdom is no end; 
" 
and frankincense, because He was God, who also "was made known in 
Judea," 
and was "declared to those who sought Him not." 

3. And then, [speaking of His] baptism, Matthew says, "The heavens were 
opened, and He saw the Spirit of God, as a dove, coming upon Him: and lo a voice 
from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." 
For Christ did not at that time descend upon Jesus, neither was Christ one and 
Jesus another: but the Word of God-who is the Saviour of all, and the ruler of 
heaven and earth, who is Jesus, as I have already pointed out, who did also take 
upon Him flesh, and was anointed by the Spirit from the Father-was made Jesus 
Christ, as Esaias also says, "There shall come forth a rod from the root of 
Jesse, and a flower shall rise from his root; and the Spirit of God shall rest 
upon Him: the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and 
might, the spirit of knowledge and piety, and the spirit of the fear of God, 
shall fill Him. He shall not judge according to glory, 
nor reprove after the manner of speech; but He shall dispense judgment to the 
humble man, and reprove the haughty ones of the earth." 
And again Esaias, pointing out beforehand His unction, and the reason why he was 
anointed, does himself say, "The Spirit of God is upon Me, because He hath 
anointed Me: He hath sent Me to preach the Gospel to the lowly, to heal the 
broken up in heart, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to the blind; 
to announce the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance; to 
comfort all that mourn." 
For inasmuch as the Word of God was man from the root of Jesse, and son of 
Abraham, in this respect did the Spirit of God rest upon Him, and anoint Him to 
preach the Gospel to the lowly. But inasmuch as He was God, He did not judge 
according to glory, nor reprove after the manner of speech. For "He needed not 
that any should testify to Him of man, 
for He Himself knew what was in man." 
For He called all men that mourn; and granting forgiveness to those who had been 
led into captivity by their sins, He loosed them from their chains, of whom 
Solomon says, "Every one shall be holden with the cords of his own sins." 
Therefore did the Spirit of God descend upon Him, [the Spirit] of Him who had 
promised by the prophets that He would anoint Him, so that we, receiving from 
the abundance of His unction, might be saved. Such, then, [is the witness] of 
Matthew.

Chapter X.-Proofs of the Foregoing, 
  Drawn from the Gospels of Mark and Luke.
1. Luke also, the follower and disciple of the apostles, referring to 
Zacharias and Elisabeth, from whom, according to promise, John was born, says: 
"And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and 
ordinances of the Lord blameless." 
And again, speaking of Zacharias: "And it came to pass, that while he executed 
the priest's office before God in the order of his course, according to the 
custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense; " 
and he came to sacrifice, "entering into the temple of the Lord." 
Whose angel Gabriel, also, who stands prominently in the presence of the Lord, 
simply, absolutely, and decidedly confessed in his own person as God and Lord, 
Him who had chosen Jerusalem, and had instituted the sacerdotal office. For he 
knew of none other above Him; since, if he had been in possession of the 
knowledge of any other more perfect God and Lord besides Him, he surely would 
never-as I have already shown-have confessed Him, whom he knew to be the fruit 
of a defect, as absolutely and altogether God and Lord. And then, speaking of 
John, he thus says: "For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and many of 
the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he shall go 
before Him in the spirit and power of Elias, to make ready a people prepared for 
the Lord." 
For whom, then, did he prepare the people, and in the sight of what Lord was he 
made great? Truly of Him who said that John had something even "more than a 
prophet," 
and that "among those born of women none is greater than John the Baptist; "who 
did also make the people ready for the Lord's advent, warning his 
fellow-servants, and preaching to them repentance, that they might receive 
remission from the Lord when He should be present, having been convened to Him, 
from whom they had been alienated because of sins and transgressions. As also 
David says, "The alienated are sinners from the womb: they go astray as soon as 
they are born." 
And it was on account of this that he, turning them to their Lord, prepared, in 
the spirit and power of Elias, a perfect people for the Lord.
2. And again, speaking in reference to the angel, he says: "But at that time 
the angel Gabriel was sent from God, who did also say to the virgin, Fear not, 
Mary; for thou hast found favour with God." 
And he says concerning the Lord: "He shall be great, and shall be called the Son 
of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father 
David: and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of His kingdom 
there shall be no end." 
For who else is there who can reign uninterruptedly over the house of Jacob for 
ever, except Jesus Christ our Lord, the Son of the Most High God, who promised 
by the law and the prophets that He would make His salvation visible to all 
flesh; so that He would become the Son of man for this purpose, that man also 
might become the son of God? And Mary, exulting because of this, cried out, 
prophesying on behalf of the Church, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my 
spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For He hath taken up His child Israel, 
in remembrance of His mercy, as He spake to our fathers, Abraham, and his seed 
for ever." 
By these and such like [passages] the Gospel points out that it was God who 
spake to the fathers; that it was He who, by Moses, instituted the legal 
dispensation, by which giving of the law we know that He spake to the fathers. 
This same God, after His great goodness, poured His compassion upon us, through 
which compassion "the Day-spring from on high hath looked upon us, and appeared 
to those who sat in darkness and the shadow of death, and has guided our feet 
into the way of peace; " 
as Zacharias also, recovering from the state of dumbness which he had suffered 
on account of unbelief, having been filled with a new spirit, did bless God in a 
new manner. For all things had entered upon a new phase, the Word arranging 
after a new manner the advent in the flesh, that He might win back 
to God that human nature (hominem) which had departed from God; and therefore 
men were taught to worship God after a new fashion, but not another god, because 
in truth there is but "one God, who justifieth the circumcision by faith, and 
the uncircumcision through faith." 
But Zacharias prophesying, exclaimed, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for He 
hath visited and redeemed His people, and hath raised up an horn of salvation 
for us in the house of His servant David; as He spake by the mouth of His holy 
prophets, which have been since the world begun; salvation from our enemies, and 
from the hand of all that hate us; to perform the mercy [promised] to our 
fathers, and to remember His holy covenant, the oath which He swore to our 
father Abraham, that He would grant unto us, that we, being delivered out of the 
hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness 
before Him, all our days." 
Then he says to John: "And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the 
Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare HiS ways; to 
give knowledge of salvation to His people, for the remission of their 
sins." 
For this is the knowledge of salvation which was wanting to them, that of the 
Son of God, which John made known, saying, "Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh 
away the sin of the world. This is He of whom I said, After me cometh a man who 
was made before me; 
because He was prior to me: and of His fulness have all we received." 
This, therefore, was the knowledge of salvation; but [it did not consist in] 
another God, nor another Father, nor Bythus, nor the Pleroma of thirty Aeons, 
nor the Mother of the (lower) Ogdoad: but the knowledge of salvation was the 
knowledge of the Son of God, who is both called and actually is, salvation, and 
Saviour, and salutary. Salvation, indeed, as follows: "I have waited for Thy 
salvation, O Lord." 
And then again, Saviour: "Behold my God, my Saviour, I will put my trust in 
Him." 
But as bringing salvation, thus: "God hath made known His salvation 
(salutare) in the sight of the heathen." 
For He is indeed Saviour, as being the Son and Word of God; but salutary, since 
[He is] Spirit; for he says: "The Spirit of our countenance, Christ the 
Lord." 
But salvation, as being flesh: for "the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among 
us." 
This knowledge of salvation, therefore, John did impart to those repenting, and 
believing in the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.
3. And the angel of the Lord, he says, appeared to the shepherds, proclaiming 
joy to them: "For 
there is born in the house of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. Then 
[appeared] a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying, Glory in 
the highest to God, and on earth peace, to men of good will." 
The falsely-called Gnostics say that these angels came from the Ogdoad, and made 
manifest the descent of the superior Christ. But they are again in error, when 
saying that the Christ and Saviour from above was not born, but that also, after 
the baptism of the dispensational Jesus, he, [the Christ of the Pleroma, ] 
descended upon him as a dove. Therefore, according to these men, the angels of 
the Ogdoad lied, when they said, "For unto you is born this day a Saviour, who 
is Christ the Lord, in the city of David." For neither was Christ nor the 
Saviour born at that time, by their account; but it was he, the dispensational 
Jesus, who is of the framer of the world, the [Demiurge], and upon whom, after 
his baptism, that is, after [the lapse of] thirty years, they maintain the 
Saviour from above descended. But why did [the angels] add, "in the city of 
David," if they did not proclaim the glad tidings of the fulfilment of God's 
promise made to David, that from the fruit of his body there should be an 
eternal King? For the Framer [Demiurge] of the entire universe made promise to 
David, as David himself declares: "My help is from God, who made heaven and 
earth; " 
and again: "In His hand are the ends of the earth, and the heights of the 
mountains are His. For the sea is His, and He did Himself make it; and His hands 
founded the dry land. Come ye, let us worship and fall down before Him, and weep 
in the presence of the Lord who made us; for He is the Lord our God." 
The Holy Spirit evidently thus declares by David to those hearing him, that 
there shall be those who despise Him who formed us, and who is God alone. 
Wherefore he also uttered the foregoing words, meaning to say: See that ye do 
not err; besides or above Him there is no other God, to whom ye should rather 
stretch out [your hands], thus rendering us pious and grateful towards Him who 
made, established, and [still] nourishes us. What, then, shall happen to those 
who have been the authors of so much blasphemy against their Creator? This 
identical truth was also what the angels [proclaimed]. For when they exclaim, 
"Glory to God in the highest, and in earth peace," they have glorified with 
these. words Him who is the Creator of the highest, that is, of super-celestial 
things, and the Founder of everything on earth: who has sent to His own 
handiwork, that is, to men, the blessing of His salvation from heaven. Wherefore 
he adds: "The shepherds returned, glorifying God for all which they had heard 
and seen, as it was told unto them." 
For the Israelitish shepherds did not glorify another god, but Him who had been 
announced by the law and the prophets, the Maker of all things, whom also the 
angels glorified. But if the angels who were from the Ogdoad were accustomed to 
glorify any other, different from Him whom the shepherds [adored], these angels 
from the Ogdoad brought to them error and not truth.
4. And still further does Luke say in reference to the Lord: "When the days 
of purification were accomplished, they brought Him up to Jerusalem, to present 
Him before the Lord, as it is written in the law of the Lord, That every male 
opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord; and that they should offer a 
sacrifice, as it is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle-doves, or two 
young pigeons: " 
in his own person most clearly calling Him Lord, who appointed the legal 
dispensation. But "Simeon," he also says, "blessed God, and said, Lord, now 
lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace; for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, 
which Thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light for the 
revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel." 
And "Anna" 
also, "the prophetess," he says, in like manner glorified God when she saw 
Christ, "and spake of Him to all them who were looking for the redemption of 
Jerusalem." 
Now by all these one God is shown forth, revealing to men the new dispensation 
of liberty, the covenant, through the new advent of His Son.
5. Wherefore also Mark, the interpreter and follower of Peter, does thus 
commence his Gospel narrative: "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the 
Son of God; as it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send My messenger before 
Thy face, which shall prepare Thy way. 
The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make 
the paths straight before our God." Plainly does the commencement of the Gospel 
quote the words of the holy prophets, and point out Him at once, whom they 
confessed as God and Lord; Him, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who had 
also made promise to Him, that He would send His messenger before His face, who 
was John, crying in the wilderness, in "the spirit and power of Elias," 
"Prepare ye the way of me Lord, make straight paths before our God." For the 
prophets did not announce one and mother God, but one and the same; under 
rations aspects, however, and many titles. For varied and rich in attribute is 
the Father, as I have already shown in the book preceding 
this; and I shall show [the same truth] from the prophets themselves in the 
further course of this work. Also, towards the conclusion of his Gospel, Mark 
says: "So then, after the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was received up into 
heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God; " 
confirming what had been spoken by the prophet: "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit 
Thou on My right hand, until I make Thy foes Thy footstool." 
Thus God and the Father are truly one and the same; He who was announced by the 
prophets, and handed down by the true Gospel; whom we Christians worship and 
love with the whole heart, as the Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things 
therein.

Chapter XI-Proofs in Continuation, 
  Extracted from St. John's Gospel. The Gospels are Four in Number, Neither More 
  Nor Less. Mystic Reasons for This.
1. John, the disciple of the Lord, preaches this faith, and seeks, by the 
proclamation of the Gospel, to remove that error which by Cerinthus had been 
disseminated among men, and a long time previously by those termed Nicolaitans, 
who are an offset of that "knowledge" falsely so called, that he might confound 
them, and persuade them that there is but one God, who made all things by His 
Word; and not, as they allege, that the Creator was one, but the Father of the 
Lord another; and that the Son of the Creator was, forsooth, one, but the Christ 
from above another, who also continued impossible, descending upon Jesus, the 
Son of the Creator, and flew back again into His Pleroma; and that Monogenes was 
the beginning, but Logos was the true son of Monogenes; and that this creation 
to which we belong was not made by the primary God, but by some power lying far 
below Him, and shut off from communion with the things invisible and ineffable. 
The disciple of the Lord therefore desiring to put an end to all such doctrines, 
and to establish the rule of truth in the Church, that there is one Almighty 
God, who made all things by His Word, both visible and invisible; showing at the 
same time, that by the Word, through whom God made the creation, He also 
bestowed salvation on the men included in the creation; thus commenced His 
teaching in the Gospel: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with 
God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things 
were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made. 
What was made was life in Him, and the life was the light of men. And the light 
shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not." 
"All things," he says, "were made by Him; "therefore in "all things" this 
creation of ours is [included], for we cannot concede to these men that [the 
words] "all things" are spoken in reference to those within their Pleroma. For 
if their Pleroma do indeed contain these, this creation, as being such, is not 
outside, as I have demonstrated in the preceding book; 
but if they are outside the Pleroma, which indeed appeared impossible, it 
follows, in that case, that their Pleroma cannot be "all things: "therefore this 
vast creation is not outside [the Pleroma].
2. John, however, does himself put this matter beyond all controversy on our 
part, when he says, "He was in this world, and the world was made by Him, and 
the world knew Him not. He came unto His own [things], and His own [people] 
received Him not." 
But according to Marcion, and those like him, neither was the world made by Him; 
nor did He come to His own things, but to those of another. And, according to 
certain of the Gnostics, this world was made by angels, and not by the Word of 
God. But according to the followers of Valentinus, the world was not made by 
Him, but by the Demiurge. For he (Soter) caused such similitudes to be made, 
after the pattern of things above, as they allege; but the Demiurge accomplished 
the work of creation. For they say that he, the Lord and Creator of the plan of 
creation, by whom they hold that this world was made, was produced from the 
Mother; while the Gospel affirms plainly, that by the Word, which was in the 
beginning with God, all things were made, which Word, he says, "was made flesh, 
and dwelt among us." 

3. But, according to these men, neither was the Word made flesh, nor Christ, 
nor the Saviour (Soter), who was produced from [the joint contributions of] all 
[the Aeons]. For they will have it, that the Word and Christ never came into 
this world; that the Saviour, too, never became incarnate, nor suffered, but 
that He descended like a dove upon the dispensational Jesus; and that, as soon 
as He had declared the unknown Father, He did again ascend into the Pleroma. 
Some, however, make the assertion, that this dispensational Jesus did become 
incarnate, and suffered, whom they represent as having passed through Mary just 
as water through a tube; but others allege him to be the Son of the Demiurge, 
upon whom the dispensational Jesus descended; while others, again, say that 
Jesus was born from Joseph and Mary, and that the Christ from above descended 
upon him, being without flesh, and impassible. But according to the opinion of 
no one of the heretics was the Word of God made flesh. For if anyone carefully 
examines the systems of them all, he will find that the Word of God is brought 
in by all of them as not having become incarnate (sine carne) and 
impassible, as is also the Christ from above. Others consider Him to have been 
manifested as a transfigured man; but they maintain Him to have been neither 
born nor to have become incarnate; whilst others [hold] that He did not assume a 
human form at all, but that, as a dove, He did descend upon that Jesus who was 
born from Mary. Therefore the Lord's disciple, pointing them all out as false 
witnesses, says, "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." 

4. And that we may not have to ask, Of what God was the Word made flesh? he 
does himself previously teach us, saying, "There was a man sent from God, whose 
name was John. The same came as a witness, that he might bear witness of that 
Light. He was not that Light, but [came] that he might testify of the 
Light." 
By what God, then, was John, the forerunner, who testifies of the Light, sent 
[into the world]? Truly it was by Him, of whom Gabriel is the angel, who also 
announced the glad tidings of his birth: [that God] who also had promised by the 
prophets that He would send His messenger before the face of His Son, 
who should prepare His way, that is, that he should bear witness of that Light 
in the spirit and power of Elias. 
But, again, of what God was Elias the servant and the prophet? Of Him who made 
heaven and earth, 
as he does himself confess. John, therefore, having been sent by the founder and 
maker of this world, how could he testify of that Light, which came down from 
things unspeakable and invisible? For all the heretics have decided that the 
Demiurge was ignorant of that Power above him, whose witness and herald John is 
found to be. Wherefore the Lord said that He deemed him "more than a 
prophet." 
For all the other prophets preached the advent of the paternal Light, and 
desired to be worthy of seeing Him whom they preached; but John did both 
announce [the advent] beforehand, in a like manner as did the others, and 
actually saw Him when He came, and pointed Him out, and persuaded many to 
believe on Him, so that he did himself hold the place of both prophet and 
apostle. For this is to be more than a prophet, because, "first apostles, 
secondarily prophets; " 
but all things from one and the same God Himself.
5. That wine, 
which was produced by God in a vineyard, and which was first consumed, was good. 
None 
of those who drank of it found fault with it; and the Lord partook of it also. 
But that wine was better which the Word made from water, on the moment, and 
simply for the use of those who had been called to the marriage. For although 
the Lord had the power to supply wine to those feasting, independently of any 
created substance, and to fill with food those who were hungry, He did not adopt 
this course; but, taking the loaves which the earth had produced, and giving 
thanks, 
and on the other occasion making water wine, He satisfied those who were 
reclining [at table], and gave drink to those who had been invited to the 
marriage; showing that the God who made the earth, and commanded it to bring 
forth fruit, who established the waters, and brought forth the fountains, was He 
who in these last times bestowed upon mankind, by His Son, the blessing of food 
and the favour of drink: the Incomprehensible [acting thus] by means of the 
comprehensible, and the Invisible by the visible; since there is none beyond 
Him, but He exists in the bosom of the Father.
6. For "no man," he says, "hath seen God at any time," unless "the 
only-begotten Son of God, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared 
[Him]." 
For He, the Son who is in His bosom, declares to all the Father who is 
invisible. Wherefore they know Him to whom the Son reveals Him; and 
again, the Father, by means of the Son, gives knowledge of His Son to those who 
love Him. By whom also Nathanael, being taught, recognised [Him], he to whom 
also the Lord bare witness, that he was "an Israelite indeed, in whom was no 
guile." 
The Israelite recognised his King, therefore did he cry out to Him, "Rabbi, Thou 
art the Son of God, Thou art the King of Israel." By whom also Peter, having 
been taught, recognised Christ as the Son of the living God, when [God] said, 
"Behold My dearly beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: I will put my Spirit 
upon Him, and He shall show judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive, nor 
cry; neither shall any man hear His voice in the streets. A bruised reed shall 
He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, until He send forth judgment 
into contention ; 
and in His name shall the Gentiles trust." 

7. Such, then, are the first principles of the Gospel: that there is one God, 
the Maker of this universe; He who was also announced by the prophets, and who 
by Moses set forth the dispensation of the law,-[principles] which proclaim the 
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and ignore any other God or Father except Him. 
So firm is the ground upon which these Gospels rest, that the very heretics 
themselves bear witness to them, and, starting from these [documents], each one 
of them endeavours to establish his own peculiar doctrine. For the Ebionites, 
who use Matthew's Gospel 
only, are confuted out of this very same, making false suppositions with regard 
to the Lord. But Marcion, mutilating that according to Luke, is proved to be a 
blasphemer of the only existing God, from those [passages] which he still 
retains. Those, again, who separate Jesus from Christ, alleging that Christ 
remained impassible, but that it was Jesus who suffered, preferring the Gospel 
by Mark, if they read it with a love of truth, may have their errors rectified. 
Those, moreover, who follow Valentinus, making copious use of that according to 
John, to illustrate their conjunctions, shall be proved to be totally in error 
by means of this very Gospel, as I have shown in the first book. Since, then, 
our opponents do bear testimony to us, and make use of these [documents], our 
proof derived from them is firm and true.
8. It is not possible that the Gospels can be either more or fewer in number 
than they are. For, since there are four zones of the world in which we live, 
and four principal winds, 
while the Church is scattered throughout all the world, and the "pillar and 
ground" 
of the Church is the Gospel and the spirit of life; it is fitting that she 
should have four pillars, breathing out immortality on every side, and vivifying 
men afresh. From which fact, it is evident that the Word, the Artificer of all, 
He that sitteth upon the cherubim, and contains all things, He who was 
manifested to men, has given us the Gospel under four aspects, but bound 
together by one Spirit. As also David says, when entreating His manifestation, 
"Thou that sittest between the cherubim, shine forth." 
For the cherubim, too, were four-faced, and their faces were images of the 
dispensation of the Son of God. For, [as the Scripture] says, "The first living 
creature was like a lion," 
symbolizing His effectual working, His leadership, and royal power; the second 
[living creature] was like a calf, signifying [His] sacrificial and sacerdotal 
order; but "the third had, as it were, the face as of a man,"-an evident 
description of His advent as a human being; "the fourth was like a flying 
eagle," pointing out the gift of the Spirit hovering with His wings over the 
Church. And therefore the Gospels are in accord with these things, among which 
Christ Jesus is seated. For that according to John relates His original, 
effectual, and glorious generation from the Father, thus declaring, "In the 
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." 
Also, "all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made." For this 
reason, too, is that Gospel full of all confidence, for such is His 
person. 
But that according to Luke, taking up [His] priestly character, commenced with 
Zacharias the priest offering sacrifice to God. For now was made ready the 
fatted calf, about to be immolated for 
the finding again of the younger son. Matthew, again, relates His generation as 
a man, saying, "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, 
the son of Abraham; " 
and also, "The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise." This, then, is the 
Gospel of His humanity; 
for which reason it is, too, that [the character of] a humble and meek man is 
kept up through the whole Gospel. Mark, on the other hand, commences with [a 
reference to] the prophetical spirit coming down from on high to men, saying, 
"The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Esaias the 
prophet,"-pointing to the winged aspect of the Gospel; and on this account he 
made a compendious and cursory narrative, for such is the prophetical character. 
And the Word of God Himself used to converse with the ante-Mosaic patriarchs, in 
accordance with His divinity and glory; but for those under the law he 
instituted a sacerdotal and liturgical service. 
Afterwards, being made man for us, He sent the gift of the celestial Spirit over 
all the earth, protecting us with His wings. Such, then, as was the course 
followed by the Son of God, so was also the form of the living creatures; and 
such as was the form of the living creatures, so was also the character of the 
Gospel. 
For the living creatures are quadriform, and the Gospel is quadriform, as is 
also the course followed by the Lord. For this reason were four principal (kaqolikai/) covenants given to the human race: 
one, prior to the deluge, under Adam; the second, that after the deluge, under 
Noah; the third, the giving of the law, under Moses; the fourth, that which 
renovates man, and sums up all things in itself by means of the Gospel, raising 
and bearing men upon heavenly kingdom.its wings into the
9. These things being so, all who destroy the form of the Gospel are vain, 
unlearned, and also audacious; those, [I mean, ] who represent the aspects of 
the Gospel as being either more in number than as aforesaid, or, on the other 
hand, fewer. The former class [do so], that they may seem to have discovered 
more than is of the truth; the latter, that they may set the dispensations of 
God aside. For Marcion, rejecting the entire Gospel, yea rather, cutting himself 
off from the Gospel, boasts that he has part in the [blessings of] the 
Gospel. 
Others, again (the Montanists), that they may set at nought the gift of the 
Spirit, which in the latter times has been, by the good pleasure of the Father, 
poured out upon the human race, do not admit that aspect [of the 
evangelical dispensation] presented by John's Gospel, in which the Lord promised 
that He would send the Paraclete; 
but set aside at once both the Gospel and the prophetic Spirit. Wretched men 
indeed! who wish to be pseudo-prophets, forsooth, but who set aside the gift of 
prophecy from the Church; acting like those (the Encratitae) 
who, on account of such as come in hypocrisy, hold themselves aloof from the 
communion of the brethren. We must conclude, moreover, that these men (the 
Montanists) can not admit the Apostle Paul either. For, in his Epistle to the 
Corinthians, 
he speaks expressly of prophetical gifts, and recognises men and women 
prophesying in the Church. Sinning, therefore, in all these particulars, against 
the Spirit of God, 
they fall into the irremissible sin. But those who are from Valentinus, being, 
on the other hand, altogether reckless, while they put forth their own 
compositions, boast that they possess more Gospels than there really are. 
Indeed, they have arrived at such a pitch of audacity, as to entitle their 
comparatively recent writing "the Gospel of Truth," though it agrees in nothing 
with the Gospels of the Apostles, so that they have really no Gospel which is 
not full of blasphemy. For if what they have published is the Gospel of truth, 
and yet is totally unlike those which have been handed down to us from the 
apostles, any who please may learn, as is shown from the Scriptures themselves, 
that that which has been handed down from the apostles can no longer be reckoned 
the Gospel of truth. But that these Gospels alone are true and reliable, and 
admit neither an increase nor diminution of the aforesaid number, I have proved 
by so many and such [arguments]. For, since God made all things in due 
proportion and adaptation, it was fit also that the outward aspect of the Gospel 
should be well arranged and harmonized. The opinion of those men, therefore, who 
handed the Gospel down to us, having been investigated, from their very 
fountainheads, let us proceed also to the remaining apostles, and inquire into 
their doctrine with regard to God; then, in due course we shall listen to the 
very words of the Lord.

Chapter XII.-Doctrine of the Rest of 
  the Apostles.
1. The Apostle Peter, therefore, after the resurrection of the Lord, and His 
assumption into the heavens, being desirous of filling up the number of the 
twelve apostles, and in electing into the place of Judas any substitute who 
should be chosen by God, thus addressed those who were present: "Men [and] 
brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost, 
by the mouth of David, spake before concerning Judas, which was made guide to 
them that took Jesus. For he was numbered with us: 
... Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein; 
and, His bishop-rick let another take; " 
-thus leading to the completion of the apostles, according to the words spoken 
by David. Again, when the Holy Ghost had descended upon the disciples, that they 
all might prophesy and speak with tongues, and some mocked them, as if drunken 
with new wine, Peter said that they were not drunken, for it was the third hour 
of the day; but that this was what had been spoken by the prophet: "It shall 
come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all 
flesh, and they shall prophesy." 
The God, therefore, who did promise by the prophet, that He would send His 
Spirit upon the whole human race, was He who did send; and God Himself is 
announced by Peter as having fulfilled His own promise.
2. For Peter said, "Ye men of Israel, hear my words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man 
approved by God among you by powers, and wonders, and signs, which God did by 
Him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: Him, being delivered by the 
determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, by the hands of wicked men ye have 
slain, affixing [to the cross]: whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains 
of death; because it was not possible that he should be holden of them. For 
David speaketh concerning Him, 
I foresaw the Lord always before my face; for He is on my right hand, lest I 
should be moved: therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; 
moreover also, my flesh shall rest in hope: because Thou wilt not leave my soul 
in hell, neither wilt Thou give Thy Holy One to see corruption." 
Then he proceeds to speak confidently to them concerning the patriarch David, 
that he was dead and buried, and that his sepulchre is with them to this day. He 
said, "But since he was a prophet, and knew that God had sworn with an oath to 
him, that of the fruit of his body one should sit in his throne; foreseeing 
this, he spake of the resurrection of Christ, that He was not left in hell, 
neither did His flesh see corruption. This Jesus," he said, "hath God raised up, 
of which we all are witnesses: who, being exalted by the right hand of God, 
receiving from the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, hath shed forth this 
gift 
which ye now see and hear. For David has not ascended into the heavens; but he 
saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My fight hand, until I 
make Thy foes Thy footstool. Therefore let all the house of Israel know 
assuredly, that God hath made [that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both 
Lord and Christ." 
And when the multitudes exclaimed, "What shall we do then? "Peter says to them, 
"Repent, and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus for the remission 
of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." 
Thus the apostles did not preach another God, or another Fulness; nor, that the 
Christ who suffered and rose again was one, while he who flew off on high was 
another, and remained impossible; but that there was one and the same God the 
Father, and Christ Jesus who rose from the dead; and they preached faith in Him, 
to those who did not believe on the Son of God, and exhorted them out of the 
prophets, that the Christ whom God promised to send, He sent in Jesus, whom they 
crucified and God raised up.
3. Again, when Peter, accompanied by John, had looked upon the man lame from 
his birth, before that gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, sitting and 
seeking alms, he said to him, "Silver and gold I have none; but such as I have 
give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk. And 
immediately his legs and his feet received strength; and he walked, and entered 
with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God." 
Then, when a multitude had gathered around them from all quarters because of 
this unexpected deed, Peter addressed them: "Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at 
this; or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power we had made 
this man to walk? The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, 
the God of our fathers, hath glorified His Son, whom ye delivered up for 
judgment, 
and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he wished to let Him go. But ye were 
bitterly set against 
the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; but ye 
killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead, whereof we are 
witnesses. And in the faith of His name, him, whom ye see and know, hath His 
name made strong; yea, the faith which is by Him, hath given him this perfect 
soundness in the presence of you all. And now, brethren, I wot that through 
ignorance ye did this wickedness. 
... But those things which God before had showed by the mouth of all the 
prophets, that His Christ should suffer, He hath so fulfilled. Repent ye 
therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, and that 
the times of refreshing may come to you from the presence of the Lord; and He 
shall send Jesus Christ, prepared for you beforehand, 
whom the heaven must indeed receive until the times of the arrangement 
of all things, of which God hath spoken by His holy prophets. For Moses truly 
said unto our fathers, Your Lord God Shall raise up to you a Prophet from your 
brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever He shall say 
unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, whosoever will not hear 
that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. And all [the prophets] 
from Samuel, and henceforth, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of 
these days. Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God 
made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the 
kindreds of the earth be blessed. Unto you first, God, having raised up His Son, 
sent Him blessing you, that each may turn himself from his iniquities." 
Peter, together with John, preached to them this plain message of glad tidings, 
that the promise which God made to the fathers had been fulfilled by Jesus; not 
certainly proclaiming another god, but the Son of God, who also was made man, 
and suffered; thus leading Israel into knowledge, and through Jesus preaching 
the resurrection of the dead, 
and showing, that whatever the prophets had proclaimed as to the suffering of 
Christ, these had God fulfilled.
4. For this reason, too, when the chief priests were assembled, Peter, full 
of boldness, said to them, "Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, if we 
this day be examined by you of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what 
means he has been made whole; be it known to you all, and to all the people of 
Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom 
God raised from the dead, even by Him cloth this man stand here before you 
whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is 
become the head-stone of the corner. [Neither is there salvation in any other: 
for] there is none other name under heaven, which is given to men, whereby we 
must be saved: " 
Thus the apostles did not change God, but preached to the people that Christ was 
Jesus the crucified One, whom the same God that had sent the prophets, being God 
Himself, raised up, and gave in Him salvation to men.
5. They were confounded, therefore, both by this instance of healing ("for 
the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing took 
place" 
), and by the doctrine of the apostles, and by the exposition of the prophets, 
when the chief priests had sent away Peter and John. [These latter] returned to 
the rest of their fellow-apostles and disciples of the Lord, that is, to the 
Church, and related what had occurred, and how courageously they had acted in 
the name of Jesus. The whole Church, it is then said, "when they had heard that, 
lifted up the voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, Thou art God, which 
hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is; who, through 
the Holy Ghost, 
by the mouth of our father David, Thy servant, hast said, Why did the heathen 
rage, and the people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and 
the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ. For 
of a truth, in this city, 
against Thy holy Son Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius 
Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, to 
do whatsoever Thy hand and Thy counsel determined before to be done." 
These [are the] voices of the Church from which every Church had its origin; 
these are the voices of the metropolis of the citizens of the new covenant; 
these are the voices of the apostles; these are voices of the disciples of the 
Lord, the truly perfect, who, after the assumption of the Lord, were perfected 
by the Spirit, and called upon the God who made heaven, and earth, and the 
sea,-who was announced by the prophets,-and Jesus Christ His Son, whom God 
anointed, and who knew no other [God]. For at that time and place there was 
neither Valentinus, nor Marcion, nor the rest of these subverters [of the 
truth], and their adherents. Wherefore God, the Maker of all things, heard them. 
For it is said, "The place was shaken where they were assembled together; and 
they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with 
boldness" 
to every one that was willing to believe. 
"And with great power," it is added, "gave the apostles witness of the 
resurrection of the Lord Jesus," 
saying to them, "The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye seized and 
slew, hanging [Him] upon a beam of wood: Him hath God raised up by His right 
hand 
to be a Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of 
sins. And we are in this witnesses of these words; as also is the Holy Ghost, 
whom God hath given to them that believe in Him." 
"And daily," it is said, "in the temple, and from house to house, they ceased 
not to teach and preach Christ Jesus," 
the Son of God. For this was the knowledge of salvation, which renders those who 
acknowledge His Son's advent perfect towards God.
6. But as some of these men impudently assert that the apostles, when 
preaching among the Jews, could not declare to them another god besides Him in 
whom they (their hearers 
) believed, we say to them, that if the apostles used to speak to people in 
accordance with the opinion instilled into them of old, no one learned the truth 
from them, nor, at a much earlier date, from the Lord; for they say that He did 
Himself speak after the same fashion. Wherefore neither do these men themselves 
know the truth; but since such was their opinion regarding God, they had just 
received doctrine as they were able to hear it. According to this manner of 
speaking, therefore, the rule of truth can be with nobody; but all learners will 
ascribe this practice to all [teachers], that just as every person thought, and 
as far as his capability extended, so was also the language addressed to him. 
But the advent of the Lord will appear superfluous and useless, if He did indeed 
come intending to tolerate and to preserve each man's idea regarding God rooted 
in him from of old. Besides this, also, it was a much heavier task, that He whom 
the Jews had seen as a man, and had fastened to the cross, should be preached as 
Christ the Son of God, their eternal King. Since this, however, was so, they 
certainly did not speak to them in accordance with their old belief. For they, 
who told them to their face that they were the slayers of the Lord, would 
themselves also much more boldly preach that Father who is above the Demiurge, 
and not what each individual bid himself believe [respecting God]; and the sin 
was much less, if indeed they had not fastened to the cross the superior Saviour 
(to whom it behoved them to ascend), since He was impassible. For, as they did 
not speak to the Gentiles in compliance with their notions, but told them with 
boldness that their gods were no gods, but the idols of demons; so would they in 
like manner have preached to the Jews, if they had known another greater or more 
perfect Father, not nourishing nor strengthening the untrue opinion of these men 
regarding God. Moreover, while destroying the error of the Gentiles, and bearing 
them away from their gods, they did not certainly induce another error upon 
them; but, removing those which were no gods, they pointed out Him who alone was 
God and the true Father.
7. From the words of Peter, therefore, which he addressed in Caesarea to 
Cornelius the centurion, and those Gentiles with him, to whom the word of God 
was first preached, we can understand what the apostles used to preach, the 
nature of their preaching, and their idea with regard to God. For this Cornelius 
was, it is said, "a devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, 
giving much alms to the people, and praying to God always. He saw therefore, 
about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying, 
Thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. Wherefore send to Simon, who 
is called Peter." 
But when Peter saw the vision, in which the voice from heaven said to him, "What 
God hath cleansed, that call not thou common," 
this happened [to teach him] that the God who had, through the law, 
distinguished between clean and unclean, was He who had purified the Gentiles 
through the blood of His Son-He whom also Cornelius worshipped; to whom Peter, 
coming in, said, "Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: but 
in every nation, he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable 
to Him." 
He thus clearly indicates, that He whom Cornelius had previously feared as God, 
of whom he had heard through the law and the prophets, for whose sake also he 
used to give alms, is, in truth, God. the knowledge of the Son was, however, 
wanting to him; therefore did [Peter] add, "The word, ye know, which was 
published throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which 
John preached, Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost, and 
with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of 
the devil; for God was with Him. And we are witnesses of all those things which 
He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom they slew, hanging 
Him on a beam of wood: Him God raised up the third day, and showed Him openly; 
not to all the people, but unto us, witnesses chosen before of God, who did eat 
and drink with Him after the resurrection from the dead. And He commanded us to 
preach unto the people, and to testify that it is He which was ordained of God 
to be the Judge of quick and dead. To Him give all the prophets witness, that, 
through His name, every one that believeth in Him does receive remission of 
sins." 
The apostles, therefore, did preach the Son of God, of whom men were ignorant; 
and His advent, to those who had been already instructed as to God; but they did 
not bring in another god. For if Peter had known any such thing, he would have 
preached freely to the Gentiles, that the God of the Jews was indeed one, but 
the God of the Christians another; and all of them, doubtless, being awe-struck 
because of the vision of the angel, would have believed whatever he told them. 
But it is evident from Peter's words that he did indeed still retain the God who 
was already known to them; but he also bare witness to them that Jesus Christ 
was the Son of God, the Judge of quick and dead, into whom he did also command 
them to be baptized for the remission of sins; and not this alone, but he 
witnessed that Jesus was Himself the Son of God, who also, having been anointed 
with the Holy Spirit, is called Jesus Christ. And He is the same being that was 
born of Mary, as the testimony of Peter implies. Can it really be, that Peter 
was not at that time as yet in possession of the perfect knowledge which these 
men discovered afterwards? According to them, therefore, Peter was imperfect, 
and the rest of the apostles were imperfect; and so it would be fitting that 
they, coming to life again, should become disciples of these men, in order that 
they too might be made perfect. But this is truly ridiculous. These men, in 
fact, are proved to be not disciples of the apostles, but of their own wicked 
notions. To this cause also are due the various opinions which exist among them, 
inasmuch as each one adopted error just as he was capable 
[of embracing it]. But the Church throughout all the world, having its origin 
finn from the apostles, perseveres in one and the same opinion with regard to 
God and His Son.
8. But again: Whom did Philip preach to the eunuch of the queen of the 
Ethiopians, returning from Jerusalem, and reading Esaias the prophet, when he 
and this man were alone together? Was it not He of whom the prophet spoke: "He 
was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb dumb before the shearer, so 
He opened not the month? ""But who shall declare His nativity? for His life 
shall be taken away from the earth." 
[Philip declared] that this was Jesus, and that the Scripture was fulfilled in 
Him; as did also the believing eunuch himself: and, immediately requesting to be 
baptized, he said, "I believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God." 
This man was also sent into the regions of Ethiopia, to preach what he had 
himself believed, that there was one God preached by the prophets, but that the 
Son of this [God] had already made [His] appearance in human nature (secundum 
hominem), and had been led as a sheep to the slaughter; and all the other 
statements which the prophets made regarding Him.
9. Paul himself also-after that the Lord spoke to him out of heaven, and 
showed him that, in persecuting His disciples, he persecuted his own Lord, and 
sent Ananias to him that he might recover his sight, and be baptized-"preached," 
it is said, "Jesus in the synagogues at Damascus, with all freedom of speech, 
that this is the Son of God, the Christ." 
This is the mystery which he says was made known to him by revelation, that He 
who suffered under Pontius Pilate, the same is Lord of all, and King, and God, 
and Judge, receiving power from Him who is the God of all, because He became 
"obedient unto death, even the death of the cross." 
And inasmuch as this is true, when [preaching to the Athenians on the 
Areopagus-where, no Jews being present, he had it in his power to preach God 
with freedom of speech-he said to them: "God, who made the world, and all things 
therein, He, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with 
hands; neither is He touched 
by men's hands, as though He needed anything, seeing He giveth to all life, and 
breath, and all things; who hath made from one blood the whole race of men to 
dwell upon the face of the whole earth, 
predetermining the times according to the boundary of their habitation, to seek 
the Deity, if by any means they might be able to track Him out, or find Him, 
although He be not far from each of us. For in Him we live, and move, and have 
our being, as certain men of your own have said, For we are also His offspring. 
Inasmuch, then, as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the 
Deity is like unto gold or silver, or stone graven by art or man's device. 
Therefore God, winking at the times of ignorance, does now command all men 
everywhere to turn to Him with repentance; because He hath appointed a day, on 
which the world shall be judged in righteousness by the man Jesus; whereof He 
hath given assurance by raising, Him from the dead." 
Now in this passage he does not only declare to them God as the Creator of the 
world, no Jews being present, but that He did also make one race of men to dwell 
upon all the earth; as also Moses declared: "When the Most High divided the 
nations, as He scattered the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the nations 
after the number of the angels of God; " 
but that people which believes in God is not now under the power of angels, but 
under the Lord's [rule]. "For His people Jacob was made the portion of the Lord, 
Israel the cord of His inheritance." 
And again, at Lystra of Lycia (Lycaonia), when Paul was with Barnabas, and in 
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ had made a man to walk who had been lame from 
his birth, and when the crowd wished to honour them as gods because of the 
astonishing deed, he said to them: "We are men like unto you, preaching to you 
God, that ye may be turned away from these vain idols to [serve] the living God, 
who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein; who in 
times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways, although He left not 
Himself without witness, performing acts of goodness, giving you rain from 
heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and 
gladness." 
But that all his Epistles are consonant to these declarations, I shall, when 
expounding the apostle, show from the Epistles themselves, in the right place. 
But while I bring out by these proofs the truths of Scripture, and set forth 
briefly and compendiously things which are stated in various ways, do thou also 
attend to them with patience, and not deem them prolix; taking this into 
account, that proofs [of the things which are] contained in the Scriptures 
cannot be shown except from the Scriptures themselves.
10. And still further, Stephen, who was chosen the first deacon by the 
apostles, and who, of all men, was the first to follow the footsteps of the 
martyrdom of the Lord, being the first that was slain for confessing Christ, 
speaking boldly among the people, and teaching them, says: "The God of glory 
appeared to our father Abraham, ... and said to him, Get thee out of thy 
country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee; 
... and He removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. And He gave him 
none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on; yet He promised 
that He would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him.... And 
God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and 
should be brought into bondage, and should be evil-entreated four hundred years; 
and the nation whom they shall serve will I judge, says the Lord. And after that 
shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. And He gave him the covenant 
of circumcision: and so [Abraham] begat Isaac." 
And the rest of his words announce the same God, who was with Joseph and with 
the patriarchs, and who spake with Moses.
11. And that the whole range of the doctrine of the apostles proclaimed one 
and the same God, who removed Abraham, who made to him the promise of 
inheritance, who in due season gave to him the covenant of circumcision, who 
called his descendants out of Egypt, preserved outwardly by circumcision-for he 
gave it as a sign, that they might not be like the Egyptians-that He was the 
Maker of all things, that He was the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He 
was the God of glory,-they who wish may learn from the very words and acts of 
the apostles, and may contemplate the fact that this God is one, above whom is 
no other. But even if there were another god above Him, we should say, upon 
[instituting] a comparison of the quantity [of the work done by each], that the 
latter is superior to the former. For by deeds the better man appears, as I have 
already remarked; 
and, inasmuch as these men have no works of their father to adduce, the latter 
is shown to be God alone. But if any one, "doting about questions," 
do imagine that what the apostles have declared about God should be allegorized, 
let him consider my previous statements, in which I set forth one God as the 
Founder and Maker of all things, and destroyed and laid bare their allegations; 
and he shah find them agreeable to the doctrine of the apostles, and so to 
maintain what they used to teach, and were persuaded of, that there is one God, 
the Maker of all things. And when he shall have divested his mind of such error, 
and of that blasphemy against God which it implies, he will of himself find 
reason to acknowledge that both the Mosaic law and the grace of the new 
covenant, as both fitted for the times [at which they were given], were bestowed 
by one and the same God for the benefit of the human race.
12. For all those who are of a perverse mind, having been set against the 
Mosaic legislation, judging it to be dissimilar and contrary to the doctrine of 
the Gospel, have not applied themselves to investigate the causes of the 
difference of each covenant. Since, therefore, they have been deserted by the 
paternal love, and puffed up by Satan, being brought over to the doctrine of 
Simon Magus, they have apostatized in their opinions from Him who is God, and 
imagined that they have themselves discovered more than the apostles, by finding 
out another god; and [maintained] that the apostles preached the Gospel still 
somewhat under the influence of Jewish opinions, but that they themselves are 
purer [in doctrine], and more intelligent, than the apostles. Wherefore also 
Marcion and his followers have betaken themselves to mutilating the Scriptures, 
not acknowledging some books at all; and, curtailing the Gospel according to 
Luke and the Epistles of Paul, they assert that these are alone authentic, which 
they have themselves thus shortened. In another work, 
however, I shall, God granting [me strength], refute them out of these which 
they still retain. But all the rest, inflated with the false name of 
"knowledge," do certainly recognise the Scriptures; but they pervert the 
interpretations, as I have shown in the first book. And, indeed, the followers 
of Marcion do directly blaspheme the Creator, alleging him to be the creator of 
evils, [but] holding a more tolerable 
theory as to his origin, [and] maintaining that there are two beings, gods by 
nature, differing from each other,-the one being good, but the other evil. Those 
from Valentinus, however, while they employ names of a more honourable kind, and 
set forth that He who is Creator is both Father, and Lord, and God, do 
[nevertheless] render their theory or sect more blasphemous, by maintaining that 
He was not produced from any one of those Aeons within the Pleroma, but from 
that defect which had been expelled beyond the Pleroma. Ignorance of the 
Scriptures and of the dispensation of God has brought all these things upon 
them. And in the course of this work I shall touch upon the cause of the 
difference of the covenants on the one hand, and, on the other hand, of their 
unity and harmony.
13. But that both the apostles and their disciples thus taught as the Church 
preaches, and thus teaching were perfected, wherefore also they were called away 
to that which is perfect-Stephen, teaching these truths, when he was yet on 
earth, saw the glory of God, and Jesus on His right hand, and exclaimed, 
"Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand 
of God." 
These words he said, and was stoned; and thus did he fulfil the perfect 
doctrine, copying in every respect the Leader of martyrdom, and praying for 
those who were slaying him, in these words: "Lord, lay not this sin to their 
charge." Thus were they perfected who knew one and the same God, who from 
beginning to end was present with mankind in the various dispensations; as the 
prophet Hosea declares: "I have filled up visions, and used similitudes by the 
hands of the prophets." 
Those, therefore, who delivered up their souls to death for Christ's Gospel-how 
could they have spoken to men in accordance with old-established opinion? If 
this had been the course adopted by them, they should not have suffered; but 
inasmuch as they did preach things contrary to those persons who did not assent 
to the truth, for that reason they suffered. It is evident, therefore, that they 
did not relinquish the truth, but with all boldness preached to the Jews and 
Greeks. To the Jews, indeed, [they proclaimed] that the Jesus who was crucified 
by them was the Son of God, the Judge of quick and dead, and that He has 
received from His Father an eternal kingdom in Israel, as I have pointed out; 
but to the Greeks they preached one God, who made all things, and Jesus Christ 
His Son.
14. This is shown in a still clearer light from the letter of the apostles, 
which they forwarded neither to the Jews nor to the Greeks, but to those who 
from the Gentiles believed in Christ, confirming their faith. For when certain 
men had come down from Judea to Antioch-where also, first of all, the Lord's 
disciples were called Christians, because of their faith in Christ-and sought to 
persuade those who had believed on the Lord to be circumcised, and to perform 
other things after the observance of the law; and when Paul and Barnabas had 
gone up to Jerusalem to the apostles on account of this question, and the whole 
Church had convened together, Peter thus addressed them: "Men, brethren, ye know 
how that from the days of old God made choice among you, that the Gentiles by my 
mouth should hear the word of the Gospel, and believe. And God, the Searcher of 
the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as to us; and put 
no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. Now 
therefore why tempt ye God, to impose a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, 
which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that, through 
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, we are to be saved, even as they." 
After him James spoke as follows: "Men, brethren, Simon hath declared how God 
did purpose to take from among the Gentiles a people for His name. And 
thus 
do the words of the prophets agree, as it is written, After this I will return, 
and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will 
build the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: that the residue of men may seek 
after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, among whom my name has been invoked, saith 
the Lord, doing these things. 
Known from eternity is His work to God. Wherefore I for my part give judgment, 
that we trouble not them who from among the Gentiles are turned to God: but that 
it be enjoined them, that they do abstain from the vanities of idols, and from 
fornication, and from blood; and whatsoever 
they wish not to be done to themselves, let them not do to others." 
And when these things had been said, and all had given their consent, they wrote 
to them after this manner: "The apostles, and the presbyters, [and] the 
brethren, unto those brethren from among the Gentiles who are in Antioch, and 
Syria, and Cilicia, greeting: Forasmuch as we have heard that certain persons 
going out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, 
Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law; to whom we gave no such commandment: 
it seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto 
you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul; men who have delivered up their soul for 
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, that 
they may declare our opinion by word of mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy 
Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; 
that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from 
fornication; and whatsoever ye do not wish to be done to you, do not ye to 
others: from which preserving yourselves, ye shall do well, walking 
in the Holy Spirit." From all these passages, then, it is evident that they did 
not teach the existence of another Father, but gave the new covenant of liberty 
to those who had lately believed in God by the Holy Spirit. But they clearly 
indicated, from the nature of the point debated by them, as to whether or not it 
were still necessary to circumcise the disciples, that they had no idea of 
another god.
15. Neither [in that case] would they have had such a tenor with regard to 
the first covenant, as not even to have been willing to eat with the Gentiles. 
For even Peter, although he had been sent to instruct them, and had been 
constrained by a vision to that effect, spake nevertheless with not a little 
hesitation, saying to them: "Ye know how it is an unlawful thing for a man that 
is a Jew to keep company with, or to come unto, one of another nation; but God 
hath shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean. Therefore came I 
without gainsaying; " 
indicating by these words, that he would not have come to them unless he had 
been commanded. Neither, for a like reason, would he have given them baptism so 
readily, had he not heard them prophesying when the Holy Ghost rested upon them. 
And therefore did he exclaim, "Can any man forbid water, that these should not 
be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? " 
He persuaded, at the same time, those that were with him, and pointed out that, 
unless the Holy Ghost had rested upon them, there might have been some one who 
would have raised objections to their baptism. And the apostles who were with 
James allowed the Gentiles to act freely, yielding us up to the Spirit of God. 
But they themselves, while knowing the same God, continued in the ancient 
observances; so that even Peter, fearing also lest he might incur their reproof, 
although formerly eating with the Gentiles, because of the vision, and of the 
Spirit who had rested upon them, yet, when certain persons came from James, 
withdrew himself, and did not eat with them. And Paul said that Barnabas 
likewise did the same thing. 
Thus did the apostles, whom the Lord made witnesses of every action and of every 
doctrine-for upon all occasions do we find Peter, and James, and John present 
with Him-scrupulously act according to the dispensation of the Mosaic law, 
showing that it was from one and the same God; which they certainly never would 
have done, as I have already said, if they had learned from the Lord [that there 
existed] another Father besides Him who appointed the dispensation of the 
law.

Chapter XIII-Refutation of the 
  Opinion, that Paul Was the Only Apostle Who Had Knowledge of the 
  Truth.
1. With regard to those (the Marcionites) who allege that Paul alone knew the 
truth, and that to him the mystery was manifested by revelation, let Paul 
himself convict them, when he says, that one and the same God wrought in Peter 
for the apostolate of the circumcision, and in himself for the Gentiles. 
Peter, therefore, was an apostle of that very God whose was also Paul; and Him 
whom Peter preached as God among those of the circumcision, and likewise the Son 
of God, did Paul [declare] also among the Gentiles. For our Lord never came to 
save Paul alone, nor is God so limited in means, that He should have but one 
apostle who knew the dispensation of His Son. And again, when Paul says, "How 
beautiful are the feet of those bringing glad tidings of good things, and 
preaching the Gospel of peace," 
he shows clearly that it was not merely one, but there were many who used to 
preach the truth. And again, in the Epistle to the Corinthians, when he had 
recounted all those who had seen God 
after the resurrection, he says in continuation, "But whether it were I or they, 
so we preach, and so ye believed," 
acknowledging as one and the same, the preaching of all those who saw God 
after the resurrection from the dead.
2. And again, the Lord replied to Philip, who wished to behold the Father, 
"Have I been so long a time with you, and yet thou hast not known Me, Philip? He 
that sees Me, sees also the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the 
Father? For I am in the Father, and the Father in Me; and henceforth ye know 
Him, and have seen Him." 
To these men, therefore, did the Lord bear witness, that in Himself they had 
both known and seen the Father (and the Father is truth). To allege, then, that 
these men did not know the truth, is to act the part of false witnesses, and of 
those who have been alienated from the doctrine of Christ. For why did the Lord 
send the twelve apostles to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, 
if these men did not know the truth? How also did the seventy preach, unless 
they had themselves previously known the truth of what was preached? Or how 
could Peter have been in ignorance, to whom the Lord gave testimony, that flesh 
and blood had not revealed to him, but the Father, who is in heaven? 
Just, then, as" Paul [was] an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus 
Christ, and God the Father," 
[so with the rest; ] 
the Son indeed leading them to the Father, but the Father revealing to them the 
Son.
3. But that Paul acceded to [the request of] those who summoned him to the 
apostles, on account of the question [which had been raised], and went up to 
them, with Barnabas, to Jerusalem, not without reason, but that the liberty of 
the Gentiles might be confirmed by them, he does himself say, in the Epistle to 
the Galatians: "Then, fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with 
Barnabas, taking also Titus. But I went up by revelation, and communicated to 
them that Gospel which I preached among the Gentiles." 
And again he says, "For an hour we did give place to subjection, 
that the truth of the gospel might continue with you." If, then, any one shall, 
from the Acts of the Apostles, carefully scrutinize the time concerning which it 
is written that he went up to Jerusalem on account of the forementioned 
question, he will find those years mentioned by Paul coinciding with it. Thus 
the statement of Paul harmonizes with, and is, as it were, identical with, the 
testimony of Luke regarding the apostles.

Chapter XIV.-If Paul Had Known Any 
  Mysteries Unrevealed to the Other Apostles, Luke, His Constant Companion and 
  Fellow-Traveller, Could Not Have Been Ignorant of Them; Neither Could the 
  Truth Have Possibly Lain Hid from Him, Through Whom Alone We Learn Many and 
  Most Important Particulars of the Gospel History.
1. But that this Luke was inseparable from Paul, and his fellow-labourer in 
the Gospel, he himself clearly evinces, not as a matter of boasting, but as 
bound to do so by the truth itself. For he says that when Barnabas, and John who 
was called Mark, had parted company from Paul, and sailed to Cyprus, "we came to 
Troas; " 
and when Paul had beheld in a dream a man of Macedonia, saying, "Come into 
Macedonia, Paul, and help us," "immediately," he says, "we endeavoured to go 
into Macedonia, understanding that the Lord had called us to preach the Gospel 
unto them. Therefore, sailing from Troas, we directed our ship's course towards 
Samothracia." And then he carefully indicates all the rest of their journey as 
far as Philippi, and how they delivered their first address: "for, sitting 
down," he says, "we spake unto the women who had assembled; " 
and certain believed, even a great many. And again does he say, "But we sailed 
from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to Troas, where we 
abode seven days." 
And all the remaining [details] of his course with Paul he recounts, indicating 
with all diligence both places, and cities, and number of days, until they went 
up to Jerusalem; and what befell Paul there, 
how he was sent to Rome in bonds; the name of the centurion who took him in 
charge; 
and the signs of the ships, and how they made shipwreck; 
and the island upon which they escaped, and how they received kindness there, 
Paul healing the chief man of that island; and how they sailed from thence to 
Puteoli, and from that arrived at Rome; and for what period they sojourned at 
Rome. As Luke was present at all these occurrences, he carefully noted them down 
in writing, so that he cannot be convicted of falsehood or boastfulness, because 
all these [particulars] proved both that he was senior to all those who now 
teach otherwise, and that he was not ignorant of the truth. That he was not 
merely a follower, but also a fellow-labourer of the apostles, but especially of 
Paul, Paul has himself declared also in the Epistles, saying: "Demas hath 
forsaken me, ... and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus 
to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me." 
From this he shows that he was always attached to and inseparable from him. And 
again he says, in the Epistle to the Colossians: "Luke, the beloved physician, 
greets you." 
But surely if Luke, who always preached in company with Paul, and is called by 
him "the beloved," and with him performed the work of an evangelist, and was 
entrusted to hand down to us a Gospel, learned nothing different from him 
(Paul), as has been pointed out from his words, how can these men, who were 
never attached to Paul, boast that they have learned hidden and unspeakable 
mysteries?
2. But that Paul taught with simplicity what he knew, not only to those who 
were [employed] with him, but to those that heard him, he does himself make 
manifest. For when the bishops and presbyters who came from Ephesus and the 
other cities adjoining had assembled in Miletus, since he was himself hastening 
to Jerusalem to observe Pentecost, after testifying many things to them, and 
declaring what must happen to him at Jerusalem, he added: "I know that ye shall 
see my face no more. Therefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure 
from the blood of all. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the 
counsel of God. Take heed, therefore, both to yourselves, and to all the flock 
over which the Holy Ghost has placed you as bishops, to rule the Church of the 
Lord, 
which He has acquired for Himself through His own blood." 
Then, referring to the evil teachers who should arise, he said: "I know that 
after my departure shall grievous wolves come to you, not sparing the flock. 
Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away 
disciples after them." "I have not shunned," he says, "to declare unto you all 
the counsel of God." Thus did the apostles simply, and without respect of 
persons, deliver to all what they had themselves learned from the Lord. Thus 
also does Luke, without respect of persons, deliver to us what he had learned 
from them, as he has himself testified, saying, "Even as they delivered them 
unto us, who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the 
Word." 

3. Now if any man set Luke aside, as one who did not know the truth, he will, 
[by so acting, ] manifestly reject that Gospel of which he claims to be a 
disciple. For through him we have become acquainted with very many and important 
parts of the Gospel; for instance, the generation of John, the history of 
Zacharias, the coming of the angel to Mary, the exclamation of Elisabeth, the 
descent of the angels to the shepherds, the words spoken by them, the testimony 
of Anna and of Simeon with regard to Christ, and that twelve years of age He was 
left behind at Jerusalem; also the baptism of John, the number of the Lord's 
years when He was baptized, and that this occurred in the fifteenth year of 
Tiberius Caesar. And in His office of teacher this is what He has said to the 
rich: "Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received your consolation; 
" 
and "Woe unto you that are full, for ye shall hunger; and ye who laugh now, for 
ye shall weep; "and, "Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you: for so 
did your fathers to the false prophets." All things of the following kind we 
have known through Luke alone (and numerous actions of the Lord we have learned 
through him, which also all [the Evangelists] notice): the multitude of fishes 
which Peter's companions enclosed, when at the Lord's command they cast the 
nets; 
the woman who had suffered for eighteen years, and was healed on the 
Sabbath-day; 
the man who had the dropsy, whom the Lord made whole on the Sabbath, and how He 
did defend Himself for having performed an act of healing on that day; how He 
taught His disciples not to aspire to the uppermost rooms; how we should invite 
the poor and feeble, who cannot recompense us; the man who knocked during the 
night to obtain loaves, and did obtain them, because of the urgency of his 
importunity; 
how, when [our Lord] was sitting at meat with a Pharisee, a woman that was a 
sinner kissed His feet, and anointed them with ointment, with what the Lord said 
to Simon on her behalf concerning the two debtors; 
also about the parable of that rich man who stored up the goods which had 
accrued to him, to whom it was also said, "In this night they shall demand thy 
soul from thee; whose then shall those things be which thou hast prepared? 
" 
and similar to this, that of the rich man, who was clothed in purple and who 
fared sumptuously, and the indigent Lazarus; 
also the answer which He gave to His disciples when they said, "Increase our 
faith; " 
also His conversation with Zaccheus the publican; 
also about the Pharisee and the publican, who were praying in the temple at the 
same time; 
also the ten lepers, whom He cleansed in the way simultaneously; 
also how He ordered the lame and the blind to be gathered to the wedding from 
the lanes and streets; 
also the parable of the judge who feared not God, whom the widow's importunity 
led to avenge her cause; 
and about the fig-tree in the vineyard which produced no fruit. There are also 
many other particulars to be found mentioned by Luke alone, which are made use 
of by both Marcion and Valentinus. And besides all these, [he records] what 
[Christ] said to His disciples in the way, after the resurrection, and how they 
recognised Him in the breaking of bread. 

4. It follows then, as of course, that these men must either receive the rest 
of his narrative, or else reject these parts also. For no persons of common 
sense can permit them to receive some things recounted by Luke as being true, 
and to set others aside, as if he had not known the truth. And if indeed 
Marcion's followers reject these, they will then possess no Gospel; for, 
curtailing that according to Luke, as I have said already, they boast in having 
the Gospel [in what remains]. But the followers of Valentinus must give up their 
utterly vain talk; for they have taken from that [Gospel] many occasions for 
their own speculations, to put an evil interpretation upon what he has well 
said. If, on the other hand, they feel compelled to receive the remaining 
portions also, then, by studying the perfect Gospel, and the doctrine of the 
apostles, they will find it necessary to repent, that they may be saved from the 
danger [to which they are exposed].

Chapter XV.-Refutation of the 
  Ebionites, Who Disparaged the Authority of St. Paul, from the Writings of St. 
  Luke, Which Must Be Received as a Whole. Exposure of the Hypocrisy, Deceit, 
  and Pride of the Gnostics. The Apostles and Their Disciples Knew and Preached 
  One God, the Creator of the World.
1. But again, we allege the same against those who do not recognise Paul as 
an apostle: that they should either reject the other words of the Gospel which 
we have come to know through Luke alone, and not make use of them; or else, if 
they do receive all these, they must necessarily admit also that testimony 
concerning Paul, when he (Luke) tells us that the Lord spoke at first to him 
from heaven: "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me? I am Jesus Christ, whom thou 
persecutest; " 
and then to Ananias, saying regarding him: "Go thy way; for he is a chosen 
vessel unto Me, to bear My name among the Gentiles, and kings, and the children 
of Israel. For I will show him, from this time, how great things he must suffer 
for My name's sake." 
Those, therefore, who do not accept of him [asa teacher], who was chosen by God 
for this purpose, that he might boldly bear His name, as being sent to the 
forementioned nations, do despise the election of God, and separate themselves 
from the company of the apostles. For neither can they contend that Paul was no 
apostle, when he was chosen for this purpose; nor can they prove Luke guilty of 
falsehood, when he proclaims the truth to us with all diligence. It may be, 
indeed, that it was with this view that God set forth very many Gospel truths, 
through Luke's instrumentality, which all should esteem it necessary to use, in 
order that all persons, following his subsequent testimony, which treats upon 
the acts and the doctrine of the apostles, and holding the unadulterated rule of 
truth, may be saved. His testimony, therefore, is true, and the doctrine of the 
apostles is open and stedfast, holding nothing in reserve; nor did they teach 
one set of doctrines in private, and another in public.
2. For this is the subterfuge of false persons, evil seducers, and 
hypocrites, as they act who are from Valentinus. These men discourse to the 
multitude about those who belong to the Church, whom they do themselves term 
"vulgar," and "ecclesiastic." 
By these words they entrap the more simple, and entice them, imitating our 
phraseology, that these [dupes] may listen to them the oftener; and then these 
are asked 
regarding us, how it is, that when they hold doctrines similar to ours, we, 
without cause, keep ourselves aloof from their company; and [how it is, that] 
when they say the same things, and hold the same doctrine, we call them 
heretics? When they have thus, by means of questions, overthrown the faith of 
any, and rendered them uncontradicting hearers of their own, they describe to 
them in private the unspeakable mystery of their Pleroma. But they are 
altogether deceived, who imagine that they may learn from the Scriptural texts 
adduced by heretics, that [doctrine] which their words plausibly teach. 
For error is plausible, and bears a resemblance to the truth, but requires to be 
disguised; while truth is without disguise, and therefore has been entrusted to 
children. And if any one of their auditors do indeed demand explanations, or 
start objections to them, they affirm that he is one not capable of receiving 
the truth, and not having from above the seed [derived] from their Mother; and 
thus really give him no reply, but simply declare that he is of the intermediate 
regions, that is, belongs to animal natures. But if any one do yield himself up 
to them like a little sheep, and follows out their practice, and their 
"redemption," such an one is puffed up to such an extent, that he thinks he is 
neither in heaven nor on earth, but that he has passed within the Pleroma; and 
having already embraced his angel, he walks with a strutting gait and a 
supercilious countenance, possessing all the pompous air of a cock. There are 
those among them who assert that that man who comes from above ought to follow a 
good course of conduct; wherefore they do also pretend a gravity [of demeanour] 
with a certain superciliousness. The majority, however, having become scoffers 
also, as if already perfect, and living without regard [to appearances], yea, in 
contempt [of that which is good], call themselves "the spiritual," and allege 
that they have already become acquainted with that place of refreshing which is 
within their Pleroma.
3. But let us revert to the same line of argument [hitherto pursued]. For 
when it has been manifestly declared, that they who were the preachers of the 
truth and the apostles of liberty termed no one else God, or named him Lord, 
except the only true God the Father, and His Word, who has the pre-eminence in 
all things; it shall then be clearly proved, that they (the apostles) confessed 
as the Lord God Him who was the Creator of heaven and earth, who also spoke with 
Moses, gave to him the dispensation of the law, and who called the fathers; and 
that they knew no other. The opinion of the apostles, therefore, and of those 
(Marks and Luke) who learned from their words, concerning God, has been made 
manifest.

Chapter XVI.-Proofs from the 
  Apostolic Writings, that Jesus Christ Was One and the Same, the Only Begotten 
  Son of God, Perfect God and Perfect Man.
1. But 
there are some who say that Jesus was merely a receptacle of Christ, upon whom 
the Christ, as a dove, descended from above, and that when He had declared the 
unnameable Father He entered into the Pleroma in an incomprehensible and 
invisible manner: for that He was not comprehended, not only by men, but not 
even by those powers and virtues which are in heaven, and that Jesus was the 
Son, but that 
Christ was the Father, and the Father of Christ, God; while others say that He 
merely suffered in outward appearance, being naturally impassible. The 
Valentinians, again, maintain that the dispensational Jesus was the same who 
passed through Mary, upon whom that Saviour from the more exalted [region] 
descended, who was also termed Pan,  
because He possessed the names (vocabula) of all those who had produced 
Him; but that [this latter] shared with Him, the dispensational one, His power 
and His name; so that by His means death was abolished, but the Father was made 
known by that Saviour who had descended from above, whom they do also allege to 
be Himself the receptacle of Christ and of the entire Pleroma; confessing, 
indeed, in tongue one Christ Jesus, but being divided in [actual] opinion: for, 
as I have already observed, it is the practice of these men to say that there 
was one Christ, who was produced by Monogenes, for the confirmation of the 
Pleroma; but that another, the Saviour, was sent [forth] for the glorification 
of the Father; and yet another, the dispensational one, and whom they represent 
as having suffered, who also bore [in himself] Christ, that Saviour who returned 
into the Pleroma. I judge it necessary therefore to take into account the entire 
mind of the apostles regarding our Lord Jesus Christ, and to show that not only 
did they never hold any such opinions regarding Him; but, still further, that 
they announced through the Holy Spirit, that those who should teach such 
doctrines were agents of Satan, sent forth for the purpose of overturning the 
faith of some, and drawing them away from life.
2. That John knew the one and the same Word of God, and that He was the only 
begotten, and that He became incarnate for our salvation, Jesus Christ our Lord, 
I have sufficiently proved from the word of John himself. And Matthew, too, 
recognising one and the same Jesus Christ, exhibiting his generation as a man 
from the Virgin, 
even as God did promise David that He would raise up from the fruit of his body 
an eternal King, having made the same promise to Abraham a long time previously, 
says: "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of 
Abraham" 
Then, that he might free our mind from suspicion regarding Joseph, he says: "But 
the birth of Christ 
was on this wise. When His mother was espoused to Joseph, before they came 
together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost." Then, when Joseph had it 
in contemplation to put Mary away, since she proved with child, [Matthew tells 
us of] the angel of God standing by him, and saying: "Fear not to take unto thee 
Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she 
shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save 
His people from their sins. Now this was done, that it might be fulfilled which 
was spoken of the Lord by the prophet: Behold. a virgin shall conceive, and 
bring forth a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is, God with us; 
"clearly signifying that both the promise made to the fathers had been 
accomplished, that the Son of God was born of a virgin, and that He Himself was 
Christ the Saviour whom the prophets had foretold; not, as these men assert, 
that Jesus was He who was born of Mary, but that Christ was He who descended 
from above. Matthew might certainly have said, "Now the birth of Jesus 
was on this wise; "but the Holy Ghost, foreseeing the corrupters [of the truth], 
and guarding by anticipation against their deceit, says by Matthew, "But the 
birth of Christ was on this wise; "and that He is Emmanuel, lest 
perchance we might consider Him as a mere man: for "not by the will of the flesh 
nor by the will of man, but by the will of God was the Word made flesh; " 
and that we should not imagine that Jesus was one, and Christ another, but 
should know them to be one and the same.
3. Paul, when writing to the Romans, has explained this very point: "Paul, an 
apostle of Jesus Christ, predestinated unto the Gospel of God, which He had 
promised by His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was 
made to Him of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was predestinated 
the Son of God with power through the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection 
from the dead of our Lord Jesus Christ." 
And again, writing to the Romans about Israel, he says: "Whose are the fathers, 
and from whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is God over all, blessed for 
ever." 
And again, in his Epistle to the Galatians, he says: "But when the fulness of 
time had come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to 
redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption; 
" 
plainly indicating one God, who did by the prophets make promise of the Son, and 
one Jesus Christ our Lord, who was of the seed of David according to His birth 
from Mary; and that Jesus Christ was appointed the Son of God with power, 
according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, as being 
the first begotten in all the creation; 
the Son of God being made the Son Of man, that through Him we may receive the 
adoption,-humanity 
sustaining, and receiving, and embracing the Son of God. Wherefore Mark also 
says: "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; as it is 
written in the prophets." 
Knowing one and the same Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was announced by the 
prophets, who from the fruit of David's body was Emmanuel, "`the messenger of 
great counsel of the Father; "through whom God caused the day-spring and the 
Just One to arise to the house of David, and raised up for him an horn of 
salvation, "and established a testimony in Jacob; " 
as David says when discoursing on the causes of His birth: "And He appointed a 
law in Israel, that another generation might know [Him, ] the children which 
should he born from these, and they arising shall themselves declare to their 
children, so that they might set their hope in God, and seek after His 
commandments." 
And again, the angel said, when bringing good tidings to Mary: "He shall he 
great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord shall give unto 
Him the throne of His father David; " 
acknowledging that He who is the Son of the Highest, the same is Himself also 
the Son of David. And David, knowing by the Spirit the dispensation of the 
advent of this Person, by which He is supreme over all the living and dead, 
confessed Him as Lord, sitting on the right hand of the Most High Father. 

4. But Simeon also-he who had received an intimation from the Holy Ghost that 
he should not see death, until first he had beheld Christ Jesus-taking Him, the 
first-begotten of the Virgin, into his hands, blessed God, and said, "Lord, now 
lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word: because mine 
eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all 
people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel; 
" 
confessing thus, that the infant whom he was holding in his hands, Jesus, born 
of Mary, was Christ Himself, the Son of God, the light of all, the glory of 
Israel itself, and the peace and refreshing of those who had fallen asleep. For 
He was already despoiling men, by removing their ignorance, conferring upon them 
His own knowledge, and scattering abroad those who recognised Him, as Esaias 
says: "Call His name, Quickly spoil, Rapidly divide." 
Now these are the works of Christ. He therefore was Himself Christ, whom Simeon 
carrying [in his arms] blessed the Most High; on beholding whom the shepherds 
glorified God; whom John, while yet in his mother's womb, and He (Christ) in 
that of Mary, recognising as the Lord, saluted with leaping; whom the Magi, when 
they had seen, adored, and offered their gifts [to Him], as I have already 
stated, and prostrated themselves to the eternal King, departed by another way, 
not now returning by the way of the Assyrians. "For before the child shall have 
knowledge to cry, Father or mother, He shall receive the power of Damascus, and 
the spoils of Samaria, against the king of the Assyrians; " 
declaring, in a mysterious manner indeed, but emphatically, that the Lord did 
fight with a hidden hand against Amalek. 
For this cause, too, He suddenly removed those children belonging to the house 
of David, whose happy lot it was to have been born at that time, that He might 
send them on before into His kingdom; He, since He was Himself an infant, so 
arranging it that human infants should be martyrs, slain, according to the 
Scriptures, for the sake of Christ, who was born in Bethlehem of Judah, in the 
city of David. 

5. Therefore did the Lord also say to His disciples after the resurrection, 
"O thoughtless ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have 
spoken! Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into His 
glory? " 
And again does He say to them: "These are the words which I spoke unto you while 
I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the 
law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Me. Then opened 
He their understanding, that they should understand the Scriptures, and said 
unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise 
again from the dead, and that repentance for the remission of sins be preached 
in His name among all nations." 
Now this is He who was born of Mary; for He says: "The Son of man must suffer 
many things, and be rejected, and crucified, and on the third day rise 
again." 
The Gospel, therefore, knew no other son of man but Him who was of Mary, who 
also suffered; and no Christ who flew away from Jesus before the passion; but 
Him who was born it knew as Jesus Christ the Son of God, and that this same 
suffered and rose again, as John, the disciple of the Lord, verities, saying: 
"But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son 
of God, and that believing ye might have eternal life in His name," 
-foreseeing these blasphemous systems which divide the Lord, as far as lies in 
their power, saying that He was formed of two different substances. For this 
reason also he has thus testified to us in his Epistle: "Little children, it is 
the last time; and as ye have heard that Antichrist doth come, now have many 
antichrists appeared; whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out 
from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have 
continued with us: but [they departed], that they might be made manifest that 
they are not of us. Know ye therefore, that every lie is from without, and is 
not of the truth. Who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? 
This is Antichrist." 

6. But inasmuch as all those before mentioned, although they certainly do 
with their tongue confess one Jesus Christ, make fools of themselves, thinking 
one thing and saying another; 
for their hypotheses vary, as I have already shown, alleging, [as they do, ] 
that one Being suffered and was born, and that this was Jesus; but that there 
was another who descended upon Him, and that this was Christ, who also ascended 
again; and they argue, that he who proceeded from the Demiurge, or he who was 
dispensational, or he who sprang from Joseph, was the Being subject to 
suffering; but upon the latter there descended from the invisible and ineffable 
[places] the former, whom they assert to be incomprehensible, invisible, and 
impassible: they thus wander from the truth, because their doctrine departs from 
Him who is truly God, being ignorant that His only-begotten Word, who is always 
present with the human race, united to and mingled with His own creation, 
according to the Father's pleasure, and who became flesh, is Himself Jesus 
Christ our Lord, who did also suffer for us, and rose again on our behalf, and 
who will come again in the glory of His Father, to raise up all flesh, and for 
the manifestation of salvation, and to apply the rule of just judgment to all 
who were made by Him. There is therefore, as I have pointed out, one God the 
Father, and one Christ Jesus, who came by means of the whole dispensational 
arrangements [connected with Him], and gath ered together all things in 
Himself. 
But in every respect, too, He is man, the formation of God; and thus He took up 
man into Himself, the invisible becoming visible, the incomprehensible being 
made comprehensible, the impassible becoming capable of suffering, and the Word 
being made man, thus summing up all things in Himself: so that as in 
super-celestial, spiritual, and invisible things, the Word of God is supreme, so 
also in things visible and corporeal He might possess the supremacy, and, taking 
to Himself the pre-eminence, as well as constituting Himself Head of the Church, 
He might draw all things to Himself at the proper time.
7. With Him is nothing incomplete or out of due season, just as with the 
Father there is nothing incongruous. For all these things were foreknown by the 
Father; but the Son works them out at the proper time in perfect order and 
sequence. This was the reason why, when Mary was urging [Him] on to [perform] 
the wonderful miracle of the wine, and was desirous before the time to 
partake 
of the cup of emblematic significance, the Lord, checking her untimely haste, 
said, "Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come" 
-waiting for that hour which was foreknown by the Father. This is also the 
reason why, when men were often desirous to take Him, it is said, "No man laid 
hands upon Him, for the hour of His being taken was not yet come; " 
nor the time of His passion, which had been foreknown by the Father; as also 
says the prophet Habakkuk, "By this Thou shalt be known when the years have 
drawn nigh; Thou shalt be set forth when the time comes; because my soul is 
disturbed by anger, Thou shalt remember Thy mercy." 
Paul also says: "But when the fulness of time came, God sent forth His 
Son." 
By which is made manifest, that all things which had been foreknown of the 
Father, our Lord did accomplish in their order, season, and hour, foreknown and 
fitting, being indeed one and the same, but rich and great. For He fulfils the 
bountiful and comprehensive will of His Father, inasmuch as He is Himself the 
Saviour of those who are saved, and the Lord of those who are under authority, 
and the God of all those things which have been formed, the only-begotten of the 
Father, Christ who was announced, and the Word of God, who became incarnate when 
the fulness of time had come, at which the Son of God had to become the Son of 
man.
8. All, therefore, are outside of the [Christian] dispensation, who, under 
pretext of knowledge, understand that Jesus was one, and Christ another, and the 
Only-begotten another, from whom again is the Word, and that the Saviour is 
another, whom these disciples of error allege to be a production of those who 
were made Aeons in a state of degeneracy. Such men are to outward appearance 
sheep; for they appear to be like us, by what they say in public, repeating the 
same words as we do; but inwardly they are wolves. Their doctrine is homicidal, 
conjuring up, as it does, a number of gods, and simulating many Fathers, but 
lowering and dividing the Son of God in many ways. These are they against whom 
the Lord has cautioned us beforehand; and His disciple, in his Epistle already 
mentioned, commands us to avoid them, when he says: "For many deceivers are 
entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. 
This is a deceiver and an antichrist. Take heed to them, that ye lose not what 
ye have wrought." 
And again does he say in the Epistle: "Many false prophets are gone out into the 
world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus 
Christ is come in the flesh is of God; and every spirit which separates Jesus 
Christ is not of God, but is of antichrist." 
These words agree with what was said in the Gospel, that "the Word was made 
flesh, and dwelt among us." Wherefore he again exclaims in his Epistle, "Every 
one that believeth that Jesus is the Christ, has been born of God; " 
knowing Jesus Christ to be one and the same, to whom the gates of heaven were 
opened, because of His taking upon Him flesh: who shall also come in the same 
flesh in which He suffered, revealing the glory of the Father.
9. Concurring with these statements, Paul, speaking to the Romans, declares: 
"Much more they who receive abundance of grace and righteousness for [eternal] 
life, shall reign by one, Christ Jesus." 
It follows from this, that he knew nothing of that Christ who flew away from 
Jesus; nor did he of the Saviour above, whom they hold to be impassible. For if, 
in truth, the one suffered, and the other remained incapable of suffering, and 
the one was born, but the other descended upon him who was born, and left him 
gain, it is not one, but two, that are shown forth. But that the apostle did 
know Him as one, both who was born and who suffered, namely Christ Jesus, he 
again says in the same Epistle: "Know ye not, that so many of us as were 
baptized in Christ Jesus were baptized in His death? that like as Christ rose 
from the dead, so should we also walk in newness of life." 
But again, showing that Christ did suffer, and was Himself the Son of God, who 
died for us, and redeemed us with His blood at the time appointed beforehand, he 
says: "For how is it, that Christ, when we were yet without strength, in due 
time died for the ungodly? But God commendeth His love towards us, in that, 
while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then, being now 
justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if, when 
we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son; much more, 
being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life." 
He declares in the plainest manner, that the same Being who was laid hold of, 
and underwent suffering, and shed His blood for us, was both Christ and the Son 
of God, who did also rise again, and was taken up into heaven, as he himself 
[Paul] says: "But at the same time, [it, is] Christ [that] died, yea rather, 
that is risen again, who is even at the fight hand of God." 
And again, "Knowing that Christ, rising from the dead, dieth no more: " 
for, as himself foreseeing, through the Spirit, the subdivisions of evil 
teachers [with regard to the Lord's person], and being desirous of cutting away 
from them all occasion of cavil, he says what has been already stated, [and also 
declares: ] "But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell 
in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal 
bodies." 
This he does not utter to those alone who wish to hear: Do not err, [he says to 
all: ] Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is one and the same, who did by suffering 
reconcile us to God, and rose from the dead; who is at the right hand of the 
Father, and perfect in all things; "who, when He was buffeted, struck not in 
return; who, when He suffered, threatened not; " 
and when He underwent tyranny, He prayed His Father that He would forgive those 
who had crucified Him. For He did Himself truly bring in salvation: since He is 
Himself the Word of God, Himself the Only-begotten of the Father, Christ Jesus 
our Lord.

Chapter XVII.-The Apostles Teach 
  that It Was Neither Christ Nor the Saviour, But the Holy Spirit, Who Did 
  Descend Upon Jesus. The Reason for This Descent.
1. It certainly was in the power of the apostles to declare that Christ 
descended upon Jesus, or that the so-called superior Saviour [came down] upon 
the dispensational one, or he who is from the invisible places upon him from the 
Demiurge; but they neither knew nor said anything of the kind: for, had they 
known it, they would have also certainly stated it. But what really was the 
case, that did they record, [namely, ] that the Spirit of God as a dove 
descended upon Him; this Spirit, of whom it was declared by Isaiah, "And the 
Spirit of God shall rest upon Him," 
as I have already said. And again: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because 
He hath anointed Me." 
That is the Spirit of whom the Lord declares, "For it is not ye that speak, but 
the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you." 
And again, giving to the disciples the power of regeneration into God, 
He said to them," Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." 
For [God] promised, that in the last times He would pour Him [the Spirit] upon 
[His] servants and handmaids, that they might prophesy; wherefore He did also 
descend upon the Son of God, made the Son of man, becoming accustomed in 
fellowship with Him to dwell in the human race, to rest with human beings, and 
to dwell in the workmanship of God, working the will of the Father in them, and 
renewing them from their old habits into the newness of Christ.
2. This Spirit did David ask for the human race, saying, "And stablish me 
with Thine all-governing Spirit; " 
who also, as Luke says, descended at the day of Pentecost upon the disciples 
after the Lord's ascension, having power to admit all nations to the entrance of 
life, and to the opening of the new covenant; from whence also, with one accord 
in all languages, they uttered praise to God, the Spirit bringing distant tribes 
to unity, and offering to the Father the first-fruits of all nations. Wherefore 
also the Lord promised to send the Comforter, 
who should join us to God. For as a compacted lump of dough cannot be formed of 
dry wheat without fluid matter, nor can a loaf possess unity, so, in like 
manner, neither could we, being many, be made one in Christ Jesus without the 
water from heaven. And as dry earth does not bring forth unless it receive 
moisture, in like manner we also, being originally a dry tree, could never have 
brought forth fruit unto life without the voluntary rain from above. For our 
bodies have received unity among themselves by means of that layer which leads 
to incorruption; but our souls, by means of the Spirit. Wherefore both are 
necessary, since both contribute towards the life of God, our Lord 
compassionating that erring Samaritan woman 
-who did not remain with one husband, but committed fornication by [contracting] 
many marriages-by pointing out, and promising to her living water, so that she 
should thirst no more, nor occupy herself in acquiring the refreshing water 
obtained by labour, having in herself water springing up to eternal life. The 
Lord, receiving this as a gift from His Father, does Himself also confer it upon 
those who are partakers of Himself, sending the Holy Spirit upon all the 
earth.
3. Gideon, 
that Israelite whom God chose, that he might save the people of Israel from the 
power of foreigners, foreseeing this gracious gift, changed his request, and 
prophesied that there would be dryness upon the fleece of wool (a type of the 
people), on which alone at first there had been dew; thus indicating that they 
should no longer have the Holy Spirit from God, as saith Esaias, "I will also 
command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it," 
but that the dew, which is the Spirit of God, who descended upon the Lord, 
should be diffused throughout all the earth, "the spirit of wisdom and 
understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and 
piety, the spirit of the fear of God." 
This Spirit, again, He did confer upon the Church, sending throughout all the 
world the Comforter from heaven, from whence also the Lord tells us that the 
devil, like lightning, was cast down. 
Wherefore we have need of the dew of God, that we be not consumed by fire, nor 
be rendered unfruitful, and that where we have an accuser there we may have also 
an Advocate, 
the Lord commending to the Holy Spirit His own man, 
who had fallen among thieves, 
whom He Himself compassionated, and bound up his wounds, giving two royal 
denaria; so that we, receiving by the Spirit the image and superscription 
of the Father and the Son, might cause the denarium entrusted to us to be 
fruitful, counting out the increase [thereof] to the Lord. 

4. The Spirit, therefore, descending under the predestined dispensation, and 
the Son of God, the Only-begotten, who is also the Word of the Father, coming in 
the fulness of time, having become incarnate in man for the sake of man, and 
fulfilling all the conditions of human nature, our Lord Jesus Christ being one 
and the same, as He Himself the Lord doth testify, as the apostles confess, and 
as the prophets announce,-all the doctrines of these men who have invented 
putative Ogdoads and Tetrads, and imagined subdivisions [of the Lord's person], 
have been proved falsehoods. These 
men do, in fact, set the Spirit aside altogether; they understand that Christ 
was one and Jesus another; and they teach that there was not one Christ, but 
many. And if they speak of them as united, they do again separate them: for they 
show that one did indeed undergo sufferings, but that the other remained 
impassible; that the one truly did ascend to the Pleroma, but the other remained 
in the intermediate place; that the one does truly feast and revel in places 
invisible and above all name, but that the other is seated with the Demiurge, 
emptying him of power. It will therefore be incumbent upon thee, and all others 
who give their attention to this writing, and are anxious about their own 
salvation, not readily to express acquiescence when they hear abroad the 
speeches of these men: for, speaking things resembling the [doctrine of the] 
faithful, as I have already observed, not only do they hold opinions which are 
different, but absolutely contrary, and in all points full of blasphemies, by 
which they destroy those persons who, by reason of the resemblance of the words, 
imbibe a poison which disagrees with their constitution, just as if one, giving 
lime mixed with water for milk, should mislead by the similitude of the colour; 
as a man 
superior to me has said, concerning all that in any way corrupt the things of 
God and adulterate the truth, "Lime is wickedly mixed with the milk of God."

Chapter XVIII.-Continuation of the 
  Foregoing Argument. Proofs from the Writings of St. Paul, and from the Words 
  of Our Lord, that Christ and Jesus Cannot Be Considered as Distinct Beings; 
  Neither Can It Be Alleged that the Son of God Became Man Merely in Appearance, 
  But that He Did So Truly and Actually.
1. 
As it has been clearly demonstrated that the Word, who existed in the beginning 
with God, by whom all things were made, who was also always present with 
mankind, was in these last days, according to the time appointed by the Father, 
united to His own workmanship, inasmuch as He became a man liable to suffering, 
[it follows] that every objection is set aside of those who say, "If our Lord 
was born at that time, Christ had therefore no previous existence." For I have 
shown that the Son of God did not then begin to exist, being with the Father 
from the beginning; but when He became incarnate, and was made man, He commenced 
afresh 
the long line of human beings, and furnished us, in a brief, comprehensive 
manner, with salvation; so that what we had lost in Adam-namely, to be according 
to the image and likeness of God-that we might recover in Christ Jesus.
2. For as it was not possible that the man who had once for all been 
conquered, and who had been destroyed through disobedience, could reform 
himself, and obtain the prize of victory; and as it was also impossible that he 
could attain to salvation who had fallen under the power of sin,-the Son 
effected both these things, being the Word of God, descending from the Father, 
becoming incarnate, stooping low, even to death, and consummating the arranged 
plan of our salvation, upon whom [Paul], exhorting us unhesitatingly to believe, 
again says, "Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring down Christ; or who 
shall descend into the deep? that is, to liberate Christ again from the 
dead." 
Then he continues, "If thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and 
shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shall 
be saved." 
And he renders the reason why the Son of God did these things, saying, "For to 
this end Christ both lived, and died, and revived, that He might rule over the 
living and the dead." 
And again, writing to the Corinthians, he declares, "But we preach Christ Jesus 
crucified; " 
and adds, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the 
blood of Christ? " 

3. But who is it that has had fellowship with us in the matter of food? 
Whether is it he who is conceived of by them as the Christ above, who extended 
himself through Horos, and imparted a form to their mother; or is it He who is 
from the Virgin, Emmanuel, who did eat butter and honey, 
of whom the prophet declared, "He is also a man, and who shall know him? 
" 
He was likewise preached by Paul: "For I delivered," he says, "unto you first of 
all, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures; and that He was 
buried, and rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures." 
It is plain, then, that Paul knew no other Christ besides Him alone, who both 
suffered, and was buried, and rose gain, who was also born, and whom he speaks 
of as man. For after remarking, "But if Christ be preached, that He rose from 
the dead," 
he continues, rendering the reason of His incarnation, "For since by man came 
death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead." And everywhere, when 
[referring to] the passion of our Lord, and to His human nature, and His 
subjection to death, he employs the name of Christ, as in that passage: "Destroy 
not him with thy meat for whom Christ died." 
And again: "But now, in Christ, ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by 
the blood of Christ." 
And again: "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse 
for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth upon a tree." 
And again: "And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom 
Christ died; " 
indicating that the impassible Christ did not descend upon Jesus, but that He 
Himself, because He was Jesus Christ, suffered for us; He, who lay in the tomb, 
and rose again, who descended and ascended,-the Son of God having been made the 
Son of man, as the very name itself doth declare. For in the name of Christ is 
implied, He that anoints, He that is anointed, and the unction itself with which 
He is anointed. And it is the Father who anoints, but the Son who is anointed by 
the Spirit, who is the unction, as the Word declares by Isaiah, "The Spirit of 
the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me," 
-pointing out both the anointing Father, the anointed Son, and the unction, 
which is the Spirit.
4. The Lord Himself, too, makes it evident who it was that suffered; for when 
He asked the disciples, "Who do men say that I, the Son of man, am? " 
and when Peter had replied, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God; 
"and when he had been commended by Him [in these words], "That flesh and blood 
had not revealed it to him, but the Father who is in heaven," He made it clear 
that He, the Son of man, is Christ the Son of the living God. "For from that 
time forth," it is said, "He began to show to His disciples, how that He must go 
unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the priests, and be rejected, and 
crucified, and rise again the third day." 
He who was acknowledged by Peter as Christ, who pronounced him blessed because 
the Father had revealed the Son of the living God to him, said that He must 
Himself suffer many things, and be crucified; and then He rebuked Peter, who 
imagined that He was the Christ as the generality of men supposed 
[that the Christ should be], and was averse to the idea of His suffering, [and] 
said to the disciples, "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and 
take up his cross, and follow Me. For whosoever will save his life, shall lose 
it; and whosoever will lose it for My sake shall save it." 
For these things Christ spoke openly, He being Himself the Saviour of those who 
should be delivered over to death for their confession of Him, and lose their 
lives.
5. If, however, He was Himself not to suffer, but should fly away from Jesus, 
why did He exhort His disciples to take up the cross and follow Him,-that cross 
which these men represent Him as not having taken up, but [speak of Him] as 
having relinquished the dispensation of suffering? For that He did not say this 
with reference to the acknowledging of the Stauros (cross) above, as some 
among them venture to expound, but with respect to the suffering which He should 
Himself undergo, and that His disciples should endure, He implies when He says, 
"For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose, shall 
find it. And that His disciples must suffer for His sake, He [implied when He] 
said to the Jews, "Behold, I send you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and 
some of them ye shall kill and crucify." 
And to the disciples He was wont to say, "And ye shall stand before governors 
and kings for My sake; and they shall scourge some of you, and slay you, and 
persecute you from city to city." 
He knew, therefore, both those who should suffer persecution, and He knew those 
who should have to be scourged and slain because of Him; and He did not speak of 
any other cross, but of the suffering which He should Himself undergo first, and 
His disciples afterwards. For this purpose did He give them this exhortation: 
"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but 
rather fear Him who is able to send both soul and body into hell; " 
[thus exhorting them] to hold fast those professions of faith which they had 
made in reference to Him. For He promised to confess before His Father those who 
should confess His name before men; but declared that He would deny those who 
should deny Him, and would be ashamed of those who should be ashamed to confess 
Him. And although these things are so, some of these men have proceeded to such 
a degree of temerity, that they even pour contempt upon the martyrs, and 
vituperate those who are slain on account of the confession of the Lord, and who 
suffer all things predicted by the Lord, and who in this respect strive to 
follow the footprints of the Lord's passion, having become martyrs of the 
suffering One; these we do also enrol with the martyrs themselves. For, when 
inquisition shall be made for their blood, 
and they shall attain to glory, then all shall be confounded by Christ, who have 
cast a slur upon their martyrdom. And from this fact, that He exclaimed upon the 
cross, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do," 
the long-suffering, patience, compassion, and goodness of Christ are exhibited, 
since He both suffered, and did Himself exculpate those who had maltreated Him. 
For the Word of God, who said to us, "Love your enemies, and pray for those that 
hate you," 
Himself did this very thing upon the cross; loving the human race to such a 
degree, that He even prayed for those putting Him to death. If, however, any 
one, going upon the supposition that there are two [Christs], forms a judgment 
in regard to them, that [Christ] shall be found much the better one, and more 
patient, and the truly good one, who, in the midst of His own wounds and 
stripes, and the other [cruelties] inflicted upon Him, was beneficent, and 
unmindful of the wrongs perpetrated upon Him, than he who flew away, and 
sustained neither injury nor insult.
6. This also does likewise meet [the case] of those who maintain that He 
suffered only in appearance. For if He did not truly suffer, no thanks to Him, 
since there was no suffering at all; and when we shall actually begin to suffer, 
He will seem as leading us astray, exhorting us to endure buffering, and to turn 
the other 
cheek, if He did not Himself before us in reality suffer the same; and as He 
misled them by seeming to them what He was not, so does He also mislead us, by 
exhorting us to endure what He did not endure Himself. [In that case] we shall 
be even above the Master, because we suffer and sustain what our Master never 
bore or endured. But as our Lord is alone truly Master, so the Son of God is 
truly good and patient, the Word of God the Father having been made the Son of 
man. For He fought and conquered; for He was man contending for the 
fathers, 
and through obedience doing away with disobedience completely: for He bound the 
strong man, 
and set free the weak, and endowed His own handiwork with salvation, by 
destroying sin. For He is a most holy and merciful Lord, and loves the human 
race.
7. Therefore, as I have already said, He caused man (human nature) to cleave 
to and to become, one with God. For unless man had overcome the enemy of man, 
the enemy would not have been legitimately vanquished. And again: unless it had 
been God who had freely given salvation, we could never have possessed it 
securely. And unless man had been joined to God, he could never have become a 
partaker of incorruptibility. For it was incumbent upon the Mediator between God 
and men, by His relationship to both, to bring both to friendship and concord, 
and present man to God, while He revealed God to man. 
For, in what way could we be partaken of the adoption of sons, unless we had 
received from Him through the Son that fellowship which refers to Himself, 
unless His Word, having been made flesh, had entered into communion with us? 
Wherefore also He passed through every stage of life, restoring to all communion 
with God. Those, therefore, who assert that He appeared putatively, and was 
neither born in the flesh nor truly made man, are as yet under the old 
condemnation, holding out patronage to sin; for, by their showing, death has not 
been vanquished, which "reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not 
sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression." 
But the law coming, which was given by Moses, and testifying of sin that it is a 
sinner, did truly take away his (death's) kingdom, showing that he was no king, 
but a robber; and it revealed him as a murderer. It laid, however, a weighty 
burden upon man, who had sin in himself, showing that he was liable to death. 
For as the law was spiritual, it merely made sin to stand out in relief, but did 
not destroy it. For sin had no dominion over the spirit, but over man. For it 
behoved Him who was to destroy sin, and redeem man under the power of death, 
that He should Himself be made that very same thing which he was, that is, man; 
who had been drawn by sin into bondage, but was held by death, so that sin 
should be destroyed by man, and man should go forth from death. For as by the 
disobedience of the one man who was originally moulded from virgin soil, the 
many were made sinners, 
and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the obedience of one man, who 
was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified and receive 
salvation. Thus, then, was the Word of God made man, as also Moses says: "God, 
true are His works." 
But if, not having been made flesh, He did appear as if flesh, His work was not 
a true one. But what He did appear, that He also was: God recapitulated in 
Himself the ancient formation of man, that He might kill sin, deprive death of 
its power, and vivify man; and therefore His works are true.

Chapter XIX.-Jesus Christ Was Not a 
  Mere Man, Begotten from Joseph in the Ordinary Course of Nature, But Was Very 
  God, Begotten of the Father Most High, and Very Man, Born' Of the 
  Virgin.
1. But again, those who assert that He was simply a mere man, begotten by 
Joseph, remaining in the bondage of the old disobedience, are in a state of 
death having been not as yet joined to the Word of God the Father, nor receiving 
liberty through the Son, as He does Himself declare: "If the Son shall make you 
free, ye shall be free indeed." 
But, being ignorant of Him who from the Virgin is Emmanuel, they are deprived of 
His gift, which is eternal life; 
and not receiving the incorruptible Word, they remain in mortal flesh, and are 
debtors to death, not obtaining the antidote of life. To whom the Word says, 
mentioning His own gift of grace: "I said, Ye are all the sons of the Highest, 
and gods; but ye shall die like men." 
He speaks undoubtedly these words to those who have not received the gift of 
adoption, but who despise the incarnation of the pure generation of the Word of 
God, 
defraud human nature of promotion into God, and prove themselves ungrateful to 
the Word of God, who became flesh for them. For it was for this end that the 
Word of God was made man, and He who was the Son of God became the Son of man, 
that man, having been taken into the Word, and receiving the adoption, might 
become the son of God. For by no other means could we have attained to 
incorruptibility and immortality, unless we had been united to incorruptibility 
and immortality. But how could we be joined to incorruptibility and immortality, 
unless, first, incorruptibility and immortality had become that which we also 
are, so that the corruptible might be swallowed up by incorruptibility, and the 
mortal by immortality, that might receive the adoption of sons?
2. For this reason [it is, said], "Who shall declare His generation? " 
since "He is a man, and who shall recognise Him? " 
But he to whom the Father which is in heaven has revealed Him, 
knows Him, so that he understands that He who "was not born either by the will 
of the flesh, or by the will of man," 
is the Son of man, this is Christ, the Son of the living God. For I have shown 
from the Scriptures, 
that no one of the sons of Adam is as to everything, and absolutely, called God, 
or named Lord. But that He is Himself in His own right, beyond all men who ever 
lived, God, and Lord, and King Eternal, and the Incarnate Word, proclaimed by 
all the prophets, the apostles, and by the Spirit Himself, may be seen by all 
who have attained to even a small portion of the truth. Now, the Scriptures 
would not have testified these things of Him, if, like others, He had been a 
mere man. But that He had, beyond all others, in Himself that pre-eminent birth 
which is from the Most High Father, and also experienced that pre-eminent 
generation which is from the Virgin, 
the divine Scriptures do in both respects testify of Him: also, that He was a 
man without comeliness, and liable to suffering; 
that He sat upon the foal of an ass; 
that He received for drink, vinegar and gall; 
that He was despised among the people, and humbled Himself even to death and 
that He is the holy Lord, the Wonderful, the Counsellor, the Beautiful in 
appearance, and the Mighty God, 
coming on the clouds as the Judge of all men; 
-all these things did the Scriptures prophesy of Him.
3. For as He became man in order to undergo temptation, so also was He the 
Word that He might be glorified; the Word remaining quiescent, that He might be 
capable of being tempted, dishonoured, crucified, and of suffering death, but 
the human nature being swallowed up in it (the divine), when it conquered, and 
endured [without yielding], and performed acts of kindness, and rose again, and 
was received up [into heaven]. He therefore, the Son of God, our Lord, being the 
Word of the Father, and the Son of man, since He had a generation as to His 
human nature from Mary-who was descended from mankind, and who was herself a 
human being-was made the Son of man. 
Wherefore also the Lord Himself gave us a sign, in the depth below, and in the 
height above, which man did not ask for, because he never expected that a virgin 
could conceive, or that it was possible that one remaining a virgin could bring 
forth a son, and that what was thus born should be" God with us, " and 
descend to those things which are of the earth beneath, seeking the sheep which 
had perished, which was indeed His own peculiar handiwork, and ascend to the 
height above, offering and commending to His Father that human nature 
(hominem) which had been found, making in His own person the first-fruits 
of the resurrection of man; that, as the Head rose from the dead, so also the 
remaining pan of the body-[namely, the body] of everyman who is found in 
life-when the time is fulfilled of that condemnation which existed by reason of 
disobedience, may arise, blended together and strengthened through means of 
joints and bands 
by the increase of God, each of the members having its own proper and fit 
position in the body. For there are many mansions in the Father's house, 
inasmuch as there are also many members in the body.

Chapter XX.-God Showed Himself, by 
  the Fall of Man, as Patient, Benign, Merciful, Mighty to Save. Man is 
  Therefore Most Ungrateful, If, Unmindful of His Own Lot, and of the Benefits 
  Held Out to Him, He Do Not Acknowledge Divine Grace.
1. Long-suffering therefore was God, when man became a defaulter, as 
foreseeing that victory which should be granted to him through the Word. For, 
when strength was made perfect in weakness, 
it showed the kindness and transcendent power of God. For as He patiently 
suffered Jonah to be swallowed by the whale, not that he should be swallowed up 
and perish altogether, but that, having been cast out again, he might be the 
more subject to God, and might glorify Him the more who had conferred upon him 
such an unhoped-for deliverance, and might bring the Ninevites to a lasting 
repentance, so that they should be convened to the Lord, who would deliver them 
from death, having been struck with awe by that portent which had been wrought 
in Jonah's case, as the Scripture says of them, "And they returned each from his 
evil way, and the unrighteousness which was in their hands, saying, Who knoweth 
if God will repent, and turn away His anger from us, and we shall not perish? 
" 
-so also, from the beginning, did God permit man to be swallowed up by the great 
whale, who was the author of transgression, not that he should perish altogether 
when so engulphed; but, arranging and preparing the plan of salvation, which was 
accomplished by the Word, through the sign of Jonah, for those who held the same 
opinion as Jonah regarding the Lord, and who confessed, and said, "I am a 
servant of the Lord, and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who hath made the sea 
and the dry land." 
[This was done] that man, receiving an unhoped-for salvation from God, might 
rise from the dead, and glorify God, and repeat that word which was uttered in 
prophecy by Jonah: "I cried by reason of mine affliction to the Lord my God, and 
He heard me out of the belly of hell; " 
and that he might always continue glorifying God, and giving thanks without 
ceasing, for that salvation which he has derived from Him, "that no flesh should 
glory in the Lord's presence; " 
and that man should never adopt an opposite opinion with regard to God, 
supposing that the incorruptibility which belongs to him is his own naturally, 
and by thus not holding the truth, should boast with empty superciliousness, as 
if he were naturally like to God. For he (Satan) thus rendered him (man) more 
ungrateful towards his Creator, obscured the love which God had towards man, and 
blinded his mind not to perceive what is worthy of God, comparing himself with, 
and judging himself equal to, God.
2. This, therefore, was the [object of the] long-suffering of God, that man, 
passing through all things, and acquiring the knowledge of moral discipline, 
then attaining to the resurrection from the dead, and learning by experience 
what is the source of his deliverance, may always live in a state of gratitude 
to the Lord, having obtained from Him the gift of incorruptibility, that he 
might love Him the more; for "he to whom more is forgiven, loveth more: " 
and that he may know himself, how mortal and weak he is; while he also 
understands respecting God, that He is immortal and powerful to such a degree as 
to confer immortality upon what is mortal, and eternity upon what is temporal; 
and may understand also the other attributes of God displayed towards himself, 
by means of which being instructed he may think of God in accordance with the 
divine greatness. For the glory of man [is] God, but [His] works [are the glory] 
of God; and the receptacle of all His. wisdom and power [is] man. Just as the 
physician is proved by his patients, so is God also revealed through men. And 
therefore Paul declares, "For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that He may 
have mercy upon all; " 
not saying this in reference to spiritual Aeons, but to man, who had been 
disobedient to God, and being cast off from immortality, then obtained mercy, 
receiving through the Son of God that adoption which is [accomplished] by 
Himself. For he who holds, without pride and boasting, the true glory (opinion) 
regarding created things and the Creator, who is the Almighty God of all, and 
who has granted existence to all; [such an one, ] continuing in His love 
and subjection, and giving of thanks, shall also receive from Him the greater 
glory of promotion, 
looking forward to the time when he shall become like Him who died for him, for 
He, too, "was made in the likeness of sinful flesh," 
to condemn sin, and to cast it, as now a condemned thing, away beyond the flesh, 
but that He might call man forth into His own likeness, assigning him as [His 
own] imitator to God, and imposing on him His Father's law, in order that he may 
see God, and granting him power to receive the Father; [being] 
the Word of God who dwelt in man, and became the Son of man, that He might 
accustom man to receive God, and God to dwell in man, according to the good 
pleasure of the Father.
3. On this account, therefore, the Lord Himself, 
who is Emmanuel from the Virgin, 
is the sign of our salvation, since it was the Lord Himself who saved them, 
because they could not be saved by their own instrumentality; and, therefore, 
when Paul sets forth human infirmity, he says: "For I know that there dwelleth 
in my flesh no good thing," 
showing that the "good thing" of our salvation is not from us, but from God. And 
again: "Wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this 
death? " 
Then he introduces the Deliverer, [saying, ] "The grace of Jesus Christ our 
Lord." And Isaiah declares this also, [when he says: ] "Be ye strengthened, ye 
hands that hang down, and ye feeble knees; be ye encouraged, ye feeble-minded; 
be comforted, fear not: behold, our God has given judgment with retribution, and 
shall recompense: He will come Himself, and will save us." 
Here we see, that not by ourselves, but by the help of God, we must be 
saved.
4. Again, that it should not be a mere man who should save us, nor [one] 
without flesh-for the angels are without flesh-[the same prophet] announced, 
saying: "Neither an eider, 
nor angel, but the Lord Himself will save them because He loves them, and will 
spare them He will Himself set them free." 
And that He should Himself become very man, visible, when He should be the Word 
giving salvation, Isaiah again sap: "Behold, city of Zion: thine eyes shall see 
our salvation." 
And that it was not a mere man who died for us, Isaiah says: "And the holy Lord 
remembered His dead Israel, who had slept in the land of sepulture; and He came 
down to preach His salvation to them, that He might save them." 
And Amos (Micah) the prophet declares the same: "He will turn again, and will 
have compassion upon us: He will destroy our iniquities, and will cast our sins 
into the depths of the sea." 
And again, specifying the place of His advent, he says: "The Lord hath spoken 
from Zion, and He has uttered His voice from Jerusalem." 
And that it is from that region which is towards the south of the inheritance of 
Judah that the Son of God shall come, who is God, and who was from Bethlehem, 
where the Lord was born [and] will send out His praise through all the earth, 
thus 
says the prophet Habakkuk: "God shall come from the south, and the Holy One from 
Mount, Effrem. His power covered the heavens over, and the earth is full of His 
praise. Before His face shall go forth the Word, and His feet shall advance in 
the plains." 
Thus he indicates in clear terms that He is God, and that His advent was [to 
take place] in Bethlehem, and from Mount Effrem, which is towards the south of 
the inheritance, and that [He is] man. For he says, "His feet shall advance in 
the plains: "and this is an indication proper to man. 


Chapter XXI.-A Vindication of the 
  Prophecy in Isaiah (VII. 14) Against the Misinterpretations of Theodotion, 
  Aquila, the Ebionites, and the Jews. Authority of the Septuagint 
  Version.arguments in Proof that Christ Was Born of a Virgin.
1. God, then, was made man, and the Lord did Himself save us, giving us the 
token of the Virgin. But not as some allege, among those now presuming to 
expound the Scripture, [thus: ] "Behold, a young woman shall conceive, and bring 
forth a son," 
as Theodotion the Ephesian has interpreted, and Aquila of Pontus, 
both Jewish proselytes. The Ebionites, following these, assert that He was 
begotten by Joseph; thus destroying, as far as in them lies, such a marvellous 
dispensation of God, and setting aside the testimony of the prophets which 
proceeded from God. For truly this prediction was uttered before the removal of 
the people to Babylon; that is, anterior to the supremacy acquired by the Medes 
and Persians. But it was interpreted into Greek by the Jews themselves, much 
before the period of our Lord's advent, that there might remain no suspicion 
that perchance the Jews, complying with our humour, did put this interpretation 
upon these words. They indeed, had they been cognizant of our future existence, 
and that we should use these proofs from the Scriptures, would themselves never 
have hesitated to burn their own Scriptures, which do declare that all other 
nations partake of [eternal] life, and show that they who boast themselves as 
being the house of Jacob and the people of Israel, am disinherited from the 
grace of God.
2. For before the Romans possessed their kingdom, 
while as yet the Macedonians held Asia, Ptolemy the son of Lagus, being anxious 
to adorn the library which he had founded in Alexandria, with a collection of 
the writings of all men, which were [works] of merit, made request to the people 
of Jerusalem, that they should have their Scriptures translated into the Greek 
language. And they-for at that time they were still subject to the 
Macedonians-sent to Ptolemy seventy of their elders, who were thoroughly skilled 
in the Scriptures and in both the languages, to carry out what he had 
desired. 
But he, wishing to test them individually, and fearing lest they might 
perchance, by taking counsel together, conceal the truth in the Scriptures, by 
their interpretation, separated them from each other, and commanded them all to 
write the same translation. He did this with respect to all the books. But when 
they came together in the same place before Ptolemy, and each of them compared 
his own interpretation with that of every other, God was indeed glorified, and 
the Scriptures were acknowledged as truly divine. For all of them read out the 
common translation [which they had prepared] in the very same words and the very 
same names, from beginning to end, so that even the Gentiles present perceived 
that the Scriptures had been interpreted by the inspiration of God. 
And there was nothing astonishing in God having done this,-He who, when, during 
the captivity of the people under Nebuchadnezzar, the Scriptures had been 
corrupted, and when, after seventy years, the Jews had returned to their own 
land, then, in the times of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, inspired Esdras the 
priest, of the tribe of Levi, to recast 
all the words of the former prophets, and to re-establish with the people the 
Mosaic legislation.
3. Since, therefore, the Scriptures have been interpreted with such fidelity, 
and by the grace of God, and since from these God has prepared and formed again 
our faith towards His Son, and has preserved to us the unadulterated Scriptures 
in Egypt, where the house of Jacob flourished, fleeing from the famine in 
Canaan; where also our Lord was preserved when He fled from the persecution set 
on foot by Herod; and [since] this interpretation of these Scriptures was made 
prior to our Lord's descent [to earth], and came into being before the 
Christians appeared-for our Lord was bern about the forty-first year of the 
reign of Augustus; but Ptolemy was much earlier, under whom the Scriptures were 
interpreted;-[since these things are so, I say, ] truly these men are proved to 
be impudent and presumptuous, who would now show a desire to make different 
translations, when we refute them out of these Scriptures, and shut them up to a 
belief in the advent of the Son of God. But our faith is stedfast, 
unfeigned, and the only true one, having clear proof from these Scriptures, 
which were interpreted in the way I have related; and the preaching of the 
Church is without interpolation. For the apostles, since they are of more 
ancient date than all these [heretics], agree with this aforesaid translation; 
and the translation harmonizes with the tradition of the apostles. For Peter, 
and John, and Matthew, and Paul, and the rest successively, as well as their 
followers, did set forth all prophetical [announce-merits], just as 
the interpretation of the elders contains them.
4. For the one and the same Spirit of God, who proclaimed by the prophets 
what and of what sort the advent of the Lord should be, did by these elders give 
a just interpretation of what had been truly prophesied; and He did Himself, by 
the apostles, announce that the fulness of the times of the adoption had 
arrived, that the kingdom of heaven had drawn nigh, and that He was 
dwelling within those that believe on Him who was born Emmanuel of the Virgin. 
To this effect they testify, [saying, ] that before Joseph had come together 
with Mary, while she therefore remained in virginity, "she was found with child 
of the Holy Ghost; " 
and that the angel Gabriel said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, 
and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy 
thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God; " 
and that the angel said to Joseph in a dream, "Now this was done, that it might 
be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, Behold, a virgin shall be 
with child." 
But the elders have thus interpreted what Esaias said: "And the Lord, moreover, 
said unto Ahaz, Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God out of the depth 
below, or from the height above. And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not 
tempt the Lord. And he said, It is not a small thing 
for you to weary men; and how does the Lord weary them? Therefore the Lord 
himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son; 
and ye shall call His name Emmanuel. Butter and honey shall He eat: before He 
knows or chooses out things that are evil, He shall exchange them for what is 
good; for before the child knows good or evil, He shall not consent to evil, 
that He may choose that which is good." 
Carefully, then, has the Holy Ghost pointed out, by what has been said, His 
birth from a virgin, and His essence, that He is God (for the name Emmanuel 
indicates this). And He shows that He is a man, when He says, "Butter and honey 
shall He eat; "and in that He terms Him a child also, [in saying, ] "before He 
knows good and evil; "for these are all the tokens of a human infant. But that 
He "will not consent to evil, that He may choose that which is good,"-this is 
proper to God; that by the fact, that He shall eat butter and honey, we should 
not understand that He is a mere man only, nor, on the other hand, from the name 
Emmanuel, should suspect Him to be God without flesh.
5. And when He says, "Hear, O house of David," 
He performed the part of one indicating that He whom God promised David that He 
would raise up from the fruit of his belly (ventris) an eternal King, is 
the same who was born of the Virgin, herself of the lineage of David. For on 
this account also, He promised that the King should be "of the fruit of his 
belly," which was the appropriate [term to use with respect] to a virgin 
conceiving, and not "of the fruit of his loins," nor "of the fruit of his 
reins," which expression is appropriate to a generating man, and a woman 
conceiving by a man. In this promise, therefore, the Scripture excluded all 
virile influence; yet it certainly is not mentioned that He who was born was not 
from the will of man. But it has fixed and established "the fruit of the 
belly," that it might declare the generation of Him who should be [born] 
from the Virgin, as Elisabeth testified when filled with the Holy Ghost, saying 
to Mary, "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy belly; 
" 
the Holy Ghost pointing out to those willing to hear, that the promise which God 
had made, of raising up a King from the fruit of [David's] belly, was fulfilled 
in the birth from the Virgin, that is, from Mary. Let those, therefore, who 
alter the passage of Isaiah thus, "Behold, a young woman shall conceive," and 
who will have Him to be Joseph's son, also alter the form of the promise which 
was given to David, when God promised him to raise up, from the fruit of his 
belly, the horn of Christ the King. But they did not understand, otherwise they 
would have presumed to alter even this passage also.
6. But what Isaiah said, "From the height above, or from the depth 
beneath," 
was meant to indicate, that "He who descended was the same also who 
ascended." 
But in this that he said, "The Lord Himself shall give you a sign," he declared 
an unlooked-for thing with regard to His generation, which could have been 
accomplished in no other way than by God the Lord of all, God Himself giving a 
sign in the house of David. For what great thing or what sign should have been 
in this, that a young woman conceiving by a man should bring forth,-a thing 
which happens to all women that produce offspring? But since an unlooked-for 
salvation was to be provided for men through the help of God, so also was the 
unlooked-for birth from a virgin accomplished; God giving this sign, but man not 
working it out.
7. On this account also, Daniel, 
foreseeing His advent, said that a stone, cut out without hands, came into this 
world. For this is what "without hands" means, that His coming into this world 
was not by the operation of human hands, that is, of those men who are 
accustomed to stone-cutting; that is, Joseph taking no part with regard to it, 
but Mary alone co-operating with the pre-arranged plan. For this stone from the 
earth derives existence from both the power and the wisdom of God. Wherefore 
also Isaiah says: "Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I deposit in the foundations of 
Zion a stone, precious, elect, the chief, the corner-one, to be had in 
honour." 
So, then, we understand that His advent in human nature was not by the will of a 
man, but by the will of God.
8. Wherefore also Moses giving a type, cast his rod upon the earth, 
in order that it, by becoming flesh, might expose and swallow up all the 
opposition of the Egyptians, which was lifting itself up against the 
pre-arranged plan of God; 
that the Egyptians themselves might testify that it is the finger of God which 
works salvation for the people, and not the son of Joseph. For if He were the 
son of Joseph, how could He be greater than Solomon, of greater than 
Jonah, 
or greater than David, 
when He was generated from the same seed, and was a descendant of these men? And 
how was it that He also pronounced Peter blessed, because he acknowledged Him to 
be the Son of the living God? 

9. But besides, if indeed He had been the son of Joseph, He could not, 
according to Jeremiah, be either king or heir. For Joseph is shown to be the son 
of Joachim and Jechoniah, as also Matthew sets forth in his pedigree. 
But Jechoniah, and all his posterity, were disinherited from the kingdom; 
Jeremiah thus declaring, "As I live, saith the Lord, if Jechoniah the son of 
Joachim king of Judah had been made the signet of my right hand, I would pluck 
him thence, and deliver him into the hand of those seeking thy life." 
And again: "Jechoniah is dishonoured as a useless vessel, for he has been cast 
into a land which he knew not. Earth, hear the word of the Lord: Write this man 
a disinherited person; for none of his seed, sitting on the throne of David, 
shall prosper, or be a prince in Judah." 
And again, God speaks of Joachim his father: "Therefore thus saith the Lord 
concerning Joachim his father, king of Judea, There shall be from him none 
sitting upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the 
heat of day, and in the frost of night. And I will look upon him, and upon his 
sons, and will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, upon the 
land of Judah, all the evils that I have pronounced against them." 
Those, therefore, who say that He was begotten of Joseph, and that they have 
hope in Him, do cause themselves to be disinherited from the kingdom, failing 
tinder the curse and rebuke directed against Jechoniah and his seed. Because for 
this reason have these things been spoken concerning Jechoniah, the [Holy] 
Spirit foreknowing the doctrines of the evil teachers; that they may learn that 
from his seed-that is, from Joseph-He was not to be born but that, according to 
the promise of God, from David's belly the King eternal is raised up, who sums 
up all things in Himself, and has gathered into Himself the ancient formation 
[of man]. 

10. For as by one man's disobedience sin entered, and death obtained [a 
place] through sin; so also by the obedience of one man, righteousness having 
been introduced, shall cause life to fructify in those persons who in times past 
were dead. 
And as the protoplast himself Adam, had his substance from untilled and as yet 
virgin soil ("for God had not yet sent rain, and man had not tilled the 
ground" 
), and was formed by the hand of God, that is, by the Word of God, for "all 
things were made by Him," 
and the Lord took dust from the earth and formed man; so did He who is the Word, 
recapitulating Adam in Himself, rightly receive a birth, enabling Him to gather 
up Adam [into Himself], from Mary, who was as yet a virgin. If, then, the first 
Adam had a man for his father, and was born of human seed, it were reasonable to 
say that the second Adam was begotten of Joseph. But if the former was taken 
from the dust, and God was his Maker, it was incumbent that the latter also, 
making a recapitulation in Himself, should be formed as man by God, to have an 
analogy with the former as respects His origin. Why, then, did not God again 
take dust, but wrought so that the formation should be made of Mary? It was that 
there might not be another formation called into being, nor any other which 
should [require to] be saved, but that the very same formation should be summed 
up [in Christ as had existed in Adam], the analogy having been preserved.

Chapter XXII.-Christ Assumed Actual 
  Flesh, Conceived and Born of the Virgin.
1. Those, therefore, who allege that He took nothing from the Virgin do 
greatly err, [since, ] in order that they may cast away the inheritance of the 
flesh, they also reject the analogy [between Him and Adam]. For if the one [who 
sprang] from the earth had indeed formation and substance from both the hand and 
workmanship of God, but the other not from the hand and workmanship of God, then 
He who was made after the image and likeness of the former did not, in that 
case, preserve the analogy of man, and He must seem an inconsistent piece of 
work, not having wherewith He may show His wisdom. But this is to say, that He 
also appeared putatively as man when He was not man, and that He was made man 
while taking nothing from man. For if He did not receive the substance of flesh 
from a human being, He neither was made man nor the Son of man; and if He was 
not made what we were, He did no great thing in what He suffered and endured. 
But every one will allow that we are [composed of] a body taken from the earth, 
and a soul receiving spirit from God. This, therefore, the Word of God was made, 
recapitulating in Himself His own handiwork; and on this account does He confess 
Himself the Son of man, and blesses "the meek, because they shall inherit the 
earth." 
The Apostle Paul, moreover, in the Epistle to the Galatians, declares plainly, 
"God sent His Son, made of a woman." 
And again, in that to the Romans, he says, "Concerning His Son, who was made of 
the seed of David according to the flesh, who was predestinated as the Son of 
God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from 
the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord." 

2. 
Superfluous, too, in that case is His descent into Mary; for why did He come 
down into her if He were to take nothing of her? Still further, if He had taken 
nothing of Mary, He would never have availed Himself of those kinds of food 
which are derived from the earth, by which that body which has been taken from 
the earth is nourished; nor would He have hungered, fasting those forty days, 
like Moses and Elias, unless His body was craving after its own proper 
nourishment; nor, again, would John His disciple have said, when writing of Him, 
"But Jesus, being wearied with the journey, was sitting [to rest]; " 
nor would David have proclaimed of Him beforehand, "They have added to the grief 
of my wounds; " 
nor would He have wept over Lazarus, nor have sweated great drops of blood; nor 
have declared, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful; " 
nor, when His side was pierced, would there have come forth blood and water. For 
all these are tokens of the flesh which had been derived from the earth, which 
He had recapitulated in Himself, bearing salvation to His own handiwork.
3. Wherefore Luke points out that the pedigree which traces the generation of 
our Lord back to Adam contains seventy-two generations, connecting the end with 
the beginning, and implying that it is He who has summed up in Himself all 
nations dispersed from Adam downwards, and all languages and generations of men, 
together with Adam himself. Hence also was Adam himself termed by Paul "the 
figure of Him that was to come," 
because the Word, the Maker of all things, had formed beforehand for Himself the 
future dispensation of the human race, connected with the Son of God; God having 
predestined that the first man should be of an animal nature, with this view, 
that he might be saved by the spiritual One. For inasmuch as He had a 
pre-existence as a saving Being, it was necessary that what might be saved 
should also be called into existence, in order that the Being who saves should 
not exist in vain.
4. In accordance with this design, Mary the Virgin is found obedient, saying, 
"Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word." 
But Eve was disobedient; for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin. And 
even as she, having indeed a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a 
virgin (for in Paradise "they were both naked, and were not ashamed," 
inasmuch as they, having been created a short time previously, had no 
understanding of the procreation of children: for it was necessary that they 
should first come to adult age, 
and then multiply from that time onward), having become disobedient, was made 
the cause of death, both to herself and to the entire human race; so also did 
Mary, having a man betrothed [to her], and being nevertheless a virgin, by 
yielding obedience, become the cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole 
human race. And on this account does the law term a woman betrothed to a man, 
the wife of him who had betrothed her, although she was as yet a virgin; thus 
indicating the back-reference from Mary to Eve, because what is joined together 
could not otherwise be put asunder than by inversion of the process by which 
these bonds of union had arisen; 
so that the former ties be cancelled by the latter, that the latter may set the 
former again at liberty. And it has, in fact, happened that the first compact 
looses from the second tie, but that the second tie takes the position of the 
first which has been cancelled. 
For this reason did the Lord declare that the first should in truth be last, and 
the last first. 
And the prophet, too, indicates the same, saying, "instead of fathers, children 
have been born unto thee." 
For the Lord, having been born "the First-begotten of the dead," 
and receiving into His bosom the ancient fathers, has regenerated them into the 
life of God, He having been made Himself the beginning of those that live, as 
Adam became the beginning of those who die. 
Wherefore also Luke, commencing the genealogy with the Lord, carried it back to 
Adam, indicating that it was He who regenerated them into the Gospel of life, 
and not they Him. And thus also it was that the knot of Eve's disobedience was 
loosed by the obedience of Mary. For what the virgin Eve had bound fast through 
unbelief, this did the virgin Mary set free through faith.

Chapter XXIII.-Arguments in 
  Opposition to Tatian, Showing that It Was Consonant to Divine Justice and 
  Mercy that the First Adam Should First Partake in that Salvation Offered to 
  All by Christ.
1. It was necessary, therefore, that the Lord, coming to the lost sheep, and 
making recapitulation of so comprehensive a dispensation, and seeking after His 
own handiwork, should save that very man who had been created after His image 
and likeness, that is, Adam, filling up the times of His condemnation, which had 
been incurred through disobedience,-[times] "which the Father had placed in His 
own power." 
[This was necessary, ] too, inasmuch as the whole economy of salvation regarding 
man came to pass according to the good pleasure of the Father, in order that God 
might not be conquered, nor His wisdom lessened, [in the estimation of His 
creatures.] For if man, who had been created by God that he might live, after 
losing life, through being injured by the serpent that had corrupted him, should 
not any more return to life, but should be utterly [and for ever] abandoned to 
death, God would [in that case] have been conquered, and the wickedness of the 
serpent would have prevailed over the will of God. But inasmuch as God is 
invincible and long-suffering, He did indeed show Himself to be long-suffering 
in the matter of the correction of man and the probation of all, as I have 
already observed; and by means of the second man did He bind the strong man, and 
spoiled his goods, 
and abolished death, vivifying that man who had been in a state of death. For at 
the first Adam became a vessel in his (Satan's) possession, whom he did also 
hold under his power, that is, by bringing sin on him iniquitously, and under 
colour of immortality entailing death upon him. For, while promising that they 
should be as gods, which was in no way possible for him to be, he wrought death 
in them: wherefore he who had led man captive, was justly captured in his turn 
by God; but man, who had been led captive, was loosed from the bonds of 
condemnation.
2. But this is Adam, if the truth should be told, the first formed man, of 
whom the Scripture says that the Lord spake, "Let Us make man after Our own 
image and likeness; " 
and we are all from him: and as we are from him, therefore have we all inherited 
his title. But inasmuch as man is saved, it is fitting that he who was created 
the original man should be saved. For it is too absurd to maintain, that he who 
was so deeply injured by the enemy, and was the first to suffer captivity, was 
not rescued by Him who conquered the enemy, but that his children were,-those 
whom he had begotten in the same captivity. Neither would the enemy appear to be 
as yet conquered, if the old spoils remained with him. To give an illustration: 
If a hostile force had overcome certain [enemies], had bound them, and led them 
away captive, and held them for a long time in servitude, so that they begat 
children among them; and somebody, compassionating those who had been made 
slaves, should overcome this same hostile force; he certainly would not act 
equitably, were he to liberate the children of those who had been led captive, 
from the sway of those who had enslaved their fathers, but should leave these 
latter, who had suffered the act of capture, subject to their enemies,-those, 
too, on whose very account he had proceeded to this retaliation,-the children 
succeeding to liberty through the avenging of their fathers' cause, but 
not 
so that their fathers, who suffered the act of capture itself, should be left 
[in bondage]. For God is neither devoid of power nor of justice, who has 
afforded help to man, and restored him to His own liberty.
3. It was for this reason, too, that immediately after Adam had transgressed, 
as the Scripture relates, He pronounced no curse against Adam personally, but 
against the ground, in reference to his works, as a certain person among the 
ancients has observed: "God did indeed transfer the curse to the earth, that it 
might not remain in man." 
But man received, as the punishment of his transgression, the toilsome task of 
tilling the earth, and to eat bread in the sweat of his face, and to return to 
the dust from whence he was taken. Similarly also did the woman [receive] toil, 
and labour, and groans, and the pangs of parturition, and a state of subjection, 
that is, that she should serve her husband; so that they should neither perish 
altogether when cursed by God, nor, by remaining unreprimanded, should be led to 
despise God. But the curse in all its fulness fell upon the serpent, which had 
beguiled them. "And God," it is declared, "said to the serpent: Because thou 
hast done this, cubed art thou above all cattle, and above all the beasts of the 
earth." 
And this same thing does the Lord also say in the Gospel, to those who are found 
upon the left hand: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into ever: lasting fire, which 
my Father hath prepared for the devil and his angels; " 
indicating that eternal fire was not originally prepared for man, but for him 
who beguiled man, and caused him to offend-for him, I say, who is chief of the 
apostasy, and for those angels who became apostates along with him; which 
[fire], indeed, they too shall justly feel, who, like him, persevere in works of 
wickedness, without repentance, and without retracing their steps.
4. [These act] 
as Cain [did, who], when he was counselled by God to keep quiet, because he had 
not made an equitable division of that share to which his brother was entitled, 
but with envy and malice thought that he could domineer over him, not only did 
not acquiesce, but even added sin to sin, indicating his state of mind by his 
action. For what he had planned, that did he also put in practice: he tyrannized 
over and slew him; God subjecting the just to the unjust, that the former might 
be proved as the just one by the things which he suffered, and the latter 
detected as the unjust by those which he perpetrated. And he was not softened 
even by this, nor did he stop short with that evil deed; but being asked where 
his brother was, he said, "I know not; am I my brother's keeper? "extending and 
aggravating [his] wickedness by his answer. For if it is wicked to slay a 
brother, much worse is it thus insolently and irreverently to reply to the 
omniscient God as if he could battle Him. And for this he did himself bear a 
curse about with him, because he gratuitously brought an offering of sin, having 
had no reverence for God, nor being put to confusion by the act of 
fratricide. 

5. The case of Adam, however, had no analogy with this, but was altogether 
different. For, having been beguiled by another under the pretext of 
immortality, he is immediately seized with terror, and hides himself; not as if 
he were able to escape from God; but, in a state of confusion at having 
transgressed His command, he feels unworthy to appear before and to hold 
converse with God. Now, "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; 
" 
the sense of sin leads to repentance, and God bestows His compassion upon those 
who are penitent. For [Adam] showed his repentance by his conduct, through means 
of the girdle [which he used], covering himself with fig-leaves, while there 
were many other leaves, which would have irritated his body in a less degree. 
He, however, adopted a dress conformable to his disobedience, being awed by the 
fear of God; and resisting the erring, the lustful propensity of his flesh 
(since he had lost his natural disposition and child-like mind, and had come to 
the knowledge of evil things), he girded a bridle of continence upon himself and 
his wife, fearing God, and waiting for His coming, and indicating, as it were, 
some such thing [as follows]: Inasmuch as, he says, I have by disobedience lost 
that robe of sanctity which I had from the Spirit, I do now also acknowledge 
that I am deserving of a covering of this nature, which affords no 
gratification, but which gnaws have retained this clothing for ever, thus 
humbling himself, if God, who is merciful, had not clothed them with tunics of 
skins instead of fig-leaves. For this purpose, too, He interrogates them, that 
the blame might light upon the woman; and again, He interrogates her, that she 
might convey the blame to the serpent. For she related what had occurred. "The 
serpent," says she, "beguiled me, and I did eat." 
But He put no question to the serpent; for He knew that he had been the prime 
mover in the guilty deed; but He pronounced the curse upon him in the first 
instance, that it might fall upon man with a mitigated rebuke. For God detested 
him who had led man astray, but by degrees, and little by little, He showed 
compassion to him who had been beguiled.
6. Wherefore also He drove him out of Paradise, and removed him far from the 
tree of life, not because He envied him the tree of life, as some venture to 
assert, but because He pitied him, [and did not desire] that he should continue 
a sinner for ever, nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal, and 
evil interminable and irremediable. But He set a bound to his [state of] sin, by 
interposing death, and thus causing sin to cease, 
putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh, which should take place in 
the earth, so that man, ceasing at length to live to sin, and dying to it, might 
begin to live to God.
7. For this end did He put enmity between the serpent and the woman and her 
seed, they keeping it up mutually: He, the sole of whose foot should be bitten, 
having power also to tread upon the enemy's head; but the other biting, killing, 
and impeding the steps of man, until the seed did come appointed to tread down 
his head,-which was born of Mary, of whom the prophet speaks: "Thou shalt tread 
upon the asp and the basilisk; thou shalt trample down the lion and the dragon; 
" 
-indicating that sin, which was set up and spread out against man, and which 
rendered him subject to death, should be deprived of its power, along with 
death, which rules [over men]; and that the lion, that is, antichrist, rampant 
against mankind in the latter days, should be trampled down by Him; and that He 
should bind "the dragon, that old serpent" 
and subject him to the power of man, who had been conquered 
so that all his might should be trodden down. Now Adam had been conquered, all 
life having been taken away from him: wherefore, when the foe was conquered in 
his turn, Adam received new life; and the last enemy, death, is 
destroyed, 
which at the first had taken possession of man. Therefore, when man has been 
liberated, "what is written shall come to pass, Death is swallowed up in 
victory. O death sting? " 
This could not be said with justice, if that man, over whom death did first 
obtain dominion, were not set free. For his salvation is death's destruction. 
When therefore the Lord vivifies man, that is, Adam, death is at the same time 
destroyed.
8. All therefore speak falsely who disallow his (Adam's) salvation, shutting 
themselves out from life for ever, in that they do not believe that the sheep 
which had perished has been found. 
For if it has not been found, the whole human race is still held in a state of 
perdition. False, therefore, is that, man who first started this idea, or 
rather, this ignorance and blindness-Tatian. 
As I have already indicated, this man entangled himself with all the 
heretics. 
This dogma, however, has been invented by himself, in order that, by introducing 
something new, independently of the rest, and by speaking vanity. he might 
acquire for himself hearers void of faith, affecting to be esteemed a teacher, 
and endeavouring from time to time to employ sayings of this kind often [made 
use of] by Paul: "In Adam we all die; " 
ignorant, however, that "where sin abounded, grace did much more abound." 
Since this, then, has been clearly shown, let all his disciples be put to shame, 
and let them wrangle 
about Adam, as if some great gain were to accrue to them if he be not saved; 
when they profit nothing more [by that], even as the serpent also did not profit 
when persuading man [to sin], except to this effect, that he proved him a 
transgressor, obtaining man as the first-fruits of his own apostasy. 
But he did not know God's power. 
Thus also do those who disallow Adam's salvation gain nothing, except this, that 
they render themselves heretics and apostates from the truth, and show 
themselves patrons of the serpent and of death.

Chapter XXIV.-Recapitulation of the 
  Various Arguments Adduced Against Gnostic Impiety Under All Its Aspects. The 
  Heretics, Tossed About by Every Blast of Doctrine, are Opposed by the Uniform 
  Teaching of the Church, Which Remains So Always, and is Consistent with 
  Itself.
1. Thus, then, have all these men been exposed, who bring in impious 
doctrines regarding our Maker and Framer, who also formed this world. and above 
whom there is no other God; and those have been overthrown by their own 
arguments who teach falsehoods regarding the substance of our Lord, and the 
dispensation which He fulfilled for the sake of His own creature man. But [it 
has, on the other hand, been shown], that the preaching of the Church is 
everywhere consistent, and continues in an even course, and receives testimony 
from the prophets, the apostles, and all the disciples-as I have proved-through 
[those in] the beginning, the middle, and the end, 
and through the entire dispensation of God, and that well-grounded system which 
tends 
to man's salvation, namely, our faith; which, having been received from the 
Church, we do preserve, and which always, by the Spirit of God, renewing its 
youth, as if it were some precious deposit in an excellent vessel, causes the 
vessel itself containing it to renew its youth also. For this gift of God has 
been entrusted to the Church, as breath was to the first created man, 
for this purpose, that all the members receiving it may be vivified; and the 
[means of] communion with Christ has been distributed throughout it, that is, 
the Holy Spirit, the earnest of incorruption, the means of confirming our faith, 
and the ladder of ascent to God. "For in the Church," it is said, "God hath set 
apostles, prophets, teachers," 
and all the other means through which the Spirit works; of which all those are 
not partakers who do not join themselves to the Church, but defraud themselves 
of life through their perverse opinions and infamous behaviour. For where the 
Church is, there is the Spirit of God; and where the Spirit of God is, there is 
the Church, and every kind of grace; but the Spirit is truth. Those, therefore, 
who do not partake of Him, are neither nourished into life from the mother's 
breasts, nor do they enjoy that most limpid fountain which issues from the body 
of Christ; but they dig for themselves broken cisterns 
out of earthly trenches, and drink putrid water out of the mire, fleeing from 
the faith of the Church lest they be convicted; and rejecting the Spirit, that 
they may not be instructed.
2. Alienated thus from the truth, they do deservedly wallow in all error, 
tossed to and fro by it, thinking differently in regard to the same things at 
different times, and never attaining to a well-grounded knowledge, being more 
anxious to be sophists of words than disciples of the truth. For they have not 
been founded upon the one rock, but upon the sand, which has in itself a 
multitude of stones. Wherefore they also imagine many gods, and they always have 
the excuse of searching [after truth] (for they are blind), but never succeed in 
finding it. For they blaspheme the Creator, Him who is truly God, who also 
furnishes power to find [the truth]; imagining that they have discovered another 
god beyond God, or another Pleroma, or another dispensation. Wherefore also the 
light which is from God does not illumine them, because they have dishonoured 
and despised God, holding Him of small account, because, through His love and 
infinite benignity, He has come within reach of human knowledge (knowledge, 
however, not with regard to His greatness, √∫ or with regard to His essence-for 
that has no man measured or handled-but after this sort: that we should know 
that He who made, and formed, and breathed in them the breath of life, and 
nourishes us by means of the creation, establishing all things by His Word, and 
binding them together by His Wisdom 
-this is He who is the only true God); but they dream of a non-existent being 
above Him, that they may be regarded as having found out the great God, whom 
nobody, [they hold, ] can recognise holding communication with the human race, 
or as directing mundane matters: that is to say, they find out the god of 
Epicurus, who does nothing either for himself or others; that is, he exercises 
no providence at all.

Chapter XXV.-This World is Ruled 
  Providence of One God, Who is Both Endowed with Infinite Justice to Punish the 
  Wicked, and with Infinite Goodness to Bless the Pious, and Impart to Them 
  Salvation.
1. God does, however, exercise a providence over all things, and therefore He 
also gives counsel; and when giving counsel, He is present with those who attend 
to moral discipline. 
It follows then of course, that the things which are watched over and governed 
should be acquainted with their ruler; which things are not irrational or vain, 
but they have understanding derived from the providence of God. And, for this 
reason certain of the Gentiles, who were less addicted to [sensual] allurements 
and voluptuousness, and were not led away to such a degree of superstition with 
regard to idols, being moved, though but slightly, by His providence, were 
nevertheless convinced that they should call the Maker of this universe the 
Father, who exercises a providence over all things, and arranges the affairs of 
our world.
2. Again, that they might remove the rebuking and judicial power from the 
Father, reckoning that as unworthy of God, and thinking that they had found out 
a God both without anger and [merely] good, they have alleged that one [God] 
judges, but that another saves, unconsciously taking away the intelligence and 
justice of both deities. For if the judicial one is not also good, to bestow 
favours upon the deserving, and to direct reproofs against those requiring them, 
he will appear neither a just nor a wise judge. On the other hand, the good God, 
if he is merely good, and not one who tests those upon whom he shall send his 
goodness, will be out of the range of justice and goodness; and his goodness 
will seem imperfect, as not saving all; [for it should do so, ] if it be not 
accompanied with judgment.
3. Marcion, therefore, himself, by dividing God into two, maintaining one to 
be good and the other judicial, does in fact, on both sides, put an end to 
deity. For he that is the judicial one, if he be not good, is not God, because 
he from whom goodness is absent is no God at all; and again, he who is good, if 
he has no judicial power, suffers the same [loss] as the former, by being 
deprived of his character of deity. And how can they call the Father of all 
wise, if they do not assign to Him a judicial faculty? For if He is wise, He is 
also one who tests [others]; but the judicial power belongs to him who tests, 
and justice follows the judicial faculty, that it may reach a just conclusion; 
justice calls forth judgment, and judgment, when it is executed with justice, 
will pass on to wisdom. Therefore the Father will excel in wisdom all human and 
angelic wisdom, because He is Lord, and Judge, and the Just One, and Ruler over 
all. For He is good, and merciful, and patient, and saves whom He ought: nor 
does goodness desert Him in the exercise of justice, 
nor is His wisdom lessened; for He saves those whom He should save, and judges 
those worthy of judgment. Neither does He show Himself unmercifully just; for 
His goodness, no doubt, goes on before, and takes precedency.
4. The God, therefore, who does benevolently cause His sun to rise upon 
all, 
and sends rain upon the just and unjust, shall judge those who, enjoying His 
equally distributed kindness, have led lives not corresponding to the dignity of 
His bounty; but who have spent their days in wantonness and luxury, in 
opposition to His benevolence, and have, moreover, even blasphemed Him who has 
conferred so great benefits upon them.
5. Plato is proved to be more religious than these men, for he allowed that 
the same God was both just and good, having power over all things, and Himself 
executing judgment, expressing himself thus, "And God indeed, as He is also the 
ancient Word, possessing the beginning, the end, and the mean of all existing 
things, does everything rightly, moving round about them according to their 
nature; but retributive justice always follows Him against those who depart from 
the divine law." 
Then, again, he points out that the Maker and Framer of the universe is good. 
"And to the good," he says, "no envy ever springs up with regard to anything; 
" 
thus establishing the goodness of God, as the beginning and the cause of the 
creation of the world, but not ignorance, nor an erring Aeon, nor the 
consequence of a defect, nor the Mother weeping and lamenting, nor another God 
or Father.
6. Well may their Mother bewail them, as capable of conceiving and inventing 
such things for they have worthily uttered this falsehood against themselves, 
that their Mother is beyond the Pleroma, that is beyond the knowledge of God, 
and that their entire multitude became 
a shapeless and crude abortion: for it apprehends nothing of the truth; it falls 
into void and darkness: for their wisdom (Sophia) was void, and wrapped 
up in darkness; and Horos did not permit her to enter the Pleroma: for the 
Spirit (Achamoth) did not receive them into the place of refreshment. For 
their father, by begetting ignorance, wrought in them the sufferings of death. 
We do not misrepresent [their opinions on] these points; but they do themselves 
confirm, they do themselves teach, they do glory in them, they imagine a lofty 
[mystery] about their Mother, whom they represent as having been begotten 
without a father, that is, without God, a female from a female, 
that is, corruption from error.
7. We do indeed pray that these men may not remain in the pit which they 
themselves have dug, but separate themselves from a Mother of this nature, and 
depart from Bythus, and stand away from the void, and relinquish the shadow; and 
that they, being converted to the Church of God, may be lawfully begotten, and 
that Christ may be formed in them, and that they may know the Framer and Maker 
of this universe, the only true God and Lord of all. We pray for these things on 
their behalf, loving them better than they seem to love themselves. For our 
love, inasmuch as it is true, is salutary to them, if they will but receive it. 
It may be compared to a severe remedy, extirpating the proud and sloughing flesh 
of a wound; for it puts an end to their pride and haughtiness. Wherefore it 
shall not weary us, to endeavour with all our might to stretch out the hand unto 
them. Over and above what has been already stated, I have deferred to the 
following book, to adduce the words of the Lord; if, by convincing some among 
them, through means of the very instruction of Christ, I may succeed in 
persuading them to abandon such error, and to cease from blaspheming their 
Creator, who is both God alone, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Amen.
