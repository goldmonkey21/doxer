3 John. The Third Epistle of John 

1:1The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I 
love in truth. 1:2Beloved, I pray that in all things thou 
mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. 1:3For I rejoiced 
greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou 
walkest in truth. 1:4Greater joy have I none than this, to 
hear of my children walking in the truth. 1:5Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in 
whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal; 1:6who 
bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set 
forward on their journey worthily of God: 1:7because that for the sake of the Name 
they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. 1:8We therefore ought 
to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth. 1:9I wrote somewhat 
unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, 
receiveth us not. 1:10Therefore, if I come, I will bring to 
remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and 
not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them 
that would he forbiddeth and casteth them out of the church. 1:11Beloved, imitate not that which is 
evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil 
hath not seen God. 1:12Demetrius hath the witness of all 
men, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness: and thou knowest 
that our witness is true. 1:13I had many things to write unto thee, 
but I am unwilling to write them to thee with ink and pen: 1:14but I hope shortly to see thee, and we 
shall speak face to face. Peace be unto thee. The friends salute thee. 
Salute the friends by name.
