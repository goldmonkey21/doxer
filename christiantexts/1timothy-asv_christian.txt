1 Timothy. The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 

1:1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus 
according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope; 1:2unto 
Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and 
Christ Jesus our Lord. 1:3As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, 
when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to 
teach a different doctrine, 1:4neither to give heed to fables and 
endless genealogies, which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of 
God which is in faith; so do I now. 1:5But the end of the 
charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned: 1:6from 
which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking; 1:7desiring to be teachers of the law, 
though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently 
affirm. 1:8But we know that the law is good, if a 
man use it lawfully, 1:9as knowing this, that law is not made 
for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and 
sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of 
mothers, for manslayers, 1:10for fornicators, for abusers of 
themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if 
there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine; 1:11according to the 
gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust. 1:12I 
thank him that enabled me, even Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he 
counted me faithful, appointing me to his service; 1:13though I was before 
a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because 
I did it ignorantly in unbelief; 1:14and the grace of our Lord abounded 
exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 1:15Faithful is the 
saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to 
save sinners; of whom I am chief: 1:16howbeit for this cause I obtained 
mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his longsuffering, 
for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life. 
1:17Now unto the King eternal, immortal, 
invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. 1:18This charge I commit unto thee, my 
child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to thee, that by 
them thou mayest war the good warfare; 1:19holding faith and a good conscience; 
which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith: 1:20of 
whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered unto Satan, that they might be 
taught not to blaspheme. 

2:1I exhort therefore, first of all, that 
supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men; 2:2for 
kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life 
in all godliness and gravity. 2:3This is good and acceptable in the sight 
of God our Saviour; 2:4who would have all men to be saved, and 
come to the knowledge of the truth. 2:5For there is one God, one mediator also 
between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus, 2:6who gave himself a 
ransom for all; the testimony to be borne in its own times; 2:7whereunto I was appointed a preacher and 
an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith 
and truth. 2:8I desire therefore that the men pray in 
every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing. 2:9In 
like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness 
and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment; 2:10but (which becometh women professing 
godliness) through good works. 2:11Let a woman learn in quietness with all 
subjection. 2:12But I permit not a woman to teach, nor 
to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness. 2:13For Adam was first 
formed, then Eve; 2:14and Adam was not beguiled, but the 
woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression: 2:15but she shall be 
saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and 
sanctification with sobriety. 

3:1Faithful is the saying, If a man seeketh 
the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. 3:2The bishop therefore 
must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, 
orderly, given to hospitality, apt to teach; 3:3no brawler, no 
striker; but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money; 3:4one that ruleth well 
his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; 3:5(but 
if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the 
church of God?) 3:6not a novice, lest being puffed up he 
fall into the condemnation of the devil. 3:7Moreover he must have good testimony 
from them that are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the 
devil. 3:8Deacons in like manner must be 
grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; 
3:9holding the mystery of the faith in a 
pure conscience. 3:10And let these also first be proved; 
then let them serve as deacons, if they be blameless. 3:11Women in like 
manner must be grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things. 
3:12Let deacons be husbands of one wife, 
ruling their children and their own houses well. 3:13For they that have 
served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing, and great boldness in 
the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 3:14These things write I unto thee, hoping 
to come unto thee shortly; 3:15but if I tarry long, that thou mayest 
know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the church 
of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. 3:16And without 
controversy great is the mystery of godliness; 
 He who was manifested in the flesh, 
 Justified in the spirit, 
 Seen of angels, 
 Preached among the nations, 
 Believed on in the world, 
 Received up in glory. 


4:1But the Spirit saith expressly, that in 
later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits 
and doctrines of demons, 4:2through the hypocrisy of men that speak 
lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron; 4:3forbidding to marry, 
and commanding to abstain from meats, which God created to be received 
with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth. 4:4For every creature 
of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with 
thanksgiving: 4:5for it is sanctified through the word of 
God and prayer. 4:6If thou put the brethren in mind of 
these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the 
words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed until 
now: 4:7but refuse profane and old wives' 
fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness: 4:8for bodily exercise 
is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having 
promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come. 4:9Faithful is the saying, and worthy of 
all acceptation. 4:10For to this end we labor and strive, 
because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, 
specially of them that believe. 4:11These things command and teach. 4:12Let no man despise thy youth; but be 
thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in 
faith, in purity. 4:13Till I come, give heed to reading, to 
exhortation, to teaching. 4:14Neglect not the gift that is in thee, 
which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the 
presbytery. 4:15Be diligent in these things; give 
thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all. 4:16Take heed to thyself, and to thy 
teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both 
thyself and them that hear thee. 


5:1Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a 
father; the younger men as brethren: 5:2the elder women as mothers; the younger 
as sisters, in all purity. 5:3Honor widows that are widows indeed. 5:4But 
if any widow hath children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety 
towards their own family, and to requite their parents: for this is acceptable 
in the sight of God. 5:5Now she that is a widow indeed, and 
desolate, hath her hope set on God, and continueth in supplications and prayers 
night and day. 5:6But she that giveth herself to pleasure 
is dead while she liveth. 5:7These things also command, that they may 
be without reproach. 5:8But if any provideth not for his own, 
and specially his own household, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an 
unbeliever. 5:9Let none be enrolled as a widow under 
threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, 5:10well reported of for good works; if she 
hath brought up children, if she hath used hospitality to strangers, if she hath 
washed the saints' feet, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath 
diligently followed every good work. 5:11But younger widows refuse: for when 
they have waxed wanton against Christ, they desire to marry; 5:12having 
condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge. 5:13And withal they 
learn also to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only 
idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not. 5:14I 
desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the 
household, give no occasion to the adversary for reviling: 5:15for already some 
are turned aside after Satan. 5:16If any woman that believeth hath 
widows, let her relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it mat 
relieve them that are widows indeed. 5:17Let the elders that rule well be 
counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in 
teaching. 5:18For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not 
muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his 
hire. 5:19Against an elder receive not an 
accusation, except at the mouth of two or three witnesses. 5:20Them that sin reprove in the sight of 
all, that the rest also may be in fear. 5:21I charge thee in the sight of 
God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things 
without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality. 5:22Lay hands hastily 
on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure. 5:23Be 
no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and 
thine often infirmities. 5:24Some men's sins are evident, going 
before unto judgment; and some men also they follow after. 5:25In like manner also 
there are good works that are evident; and such as are otherwise cannot be hid. 

6:1Let as many as are servants under the 
yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the 
doctrine be not blasphemed. 6:2And they that have believing masters, 
let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but let them serve them 
the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. 
These things teach and exhort. 6:3If any man teacheth a different 
doctrine, and consenteth not to sound words, even the words of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; 6:4he 
is puffed up, knowing nothing, but doting about questionings and disputes of 
words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 6:5wranglings of men corrupted in mind and 
bereft of the truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain. 6:6But 
godliness with contentment is great gain: 6:7for we brought nothing into the world, 
for neither can we carry anything out; 6:8but having food and covering we shall be 
therewith content. 6:9But they that are minded to be rich fall 
into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown 
men in destruction and perdition. 6:10For the love of money is a root of all 
kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, 
and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 6:11But thou, O man of 
God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, 
patience, meekness. 6:12Fight the good fight of the faith, lay 
hold on the life eternal, whereunto thou wast called, and didst confess the good 
confession in the sight of many witnesses. 6:13I charge thee in 
the sight of God, who giveth life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before 
Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession; 6:14that thou keep the 
commandment, without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord 
Jesus Christ: 6:15which in its own times he shall show, 
who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; 6:16who only hath immortality, dwelling in 
light unapproachable; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be 
honor and power eternal. Amen. 6:17Charge them that are rich in this 
present world, that they be not highminded, nor have their hope set on the 
uncertainty of riches, but on God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; 6:18that they do good, that they be rich in 
good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate; 6:19laying up in store for themselves a 
good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life 
which is life indeed. 6:20O Timothy, guard that which is 
committed unto thee, turning away from the profane babblings and 
oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called; 6:21which some 
professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.
