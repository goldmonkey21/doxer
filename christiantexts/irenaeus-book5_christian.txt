Irenaeus of Lyons












Book V.
--------

Preface.
In the four preceding books, my very dear friend, which I put forth to thee, 
all the heretics have been exposed, and their doctrines brought to light, and 
these men refuted who have devised irreligious opinions. [I have accomplished 
this by adducing] something from the doctrine peculiar to each of these men, 
which they have left in their writings, as well as by using arguments of a more 
general nature, and applicable to them all. 
Then I have pointed out the truth, and shown the preaching of the Church, which 
the prophets proclaimed (as I have already demonstrated), but which Christ 
brought to perfection, and the apostles have handed down, from whom the Church, 
receiving [these truths], and throughout all the world alone preserving them in 
their integrity (bene), has transmitted them to her sons. Then 
also-having disposed of all questions which the heretics propose to us, and 
having explained the doctrine of the apostles, and clearly set forth many of 
those things which were said and done by the Lord in parables-I shall endeavour, 
in this the fifth book of the entire work which treats of the exposure and 
refutation of knowledge falsely so called, to exhibit proofs from the rest of 
the Lord's doctrine and the apostolical epistles: [thus] complying with thy 
demand, as thou didst request of me (since indeed I have been assigned a place 
in the ministry of the word); and, labouring by every means in my power to 
furnish thee with large assistance against the contradictions of the heretics, 
as also to reclaim the wanderers and convert them to the Church of God, to 
confirm at the same time the minds of the neophytes, that they may preserve 
stedfast the faith which they have received, guarded by the Church in its 
integrity, in order that they be in no way perverted by those who endeavour to 
teach them false doctrines, and lead them away from the truth. It will be 
incumbent upon thee, however, and all who may happen to read this writing, to 
peruse with great attention what I have already said, that thou mayest obtain a 
knowledge of the subjects against which I am contending. For it is thus that 
thou wilt both controvert them in a legitimate manner, and wilt be prepared to 
receive the proofs brought forward against them, casting away their doctrines as 
filth by means of the celestial faith; but following the only true and stedfast 
Teacher, the Word of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, who did, through His 
transcendent love, become what we are, that He might bring us to be even what He 
is Himself.

Chapter I.-Christ Alone is Able to 
  Teach Divine Things, and to Redeem Us: He, the Same, Took Flesh of the Virgin 
  Mary, Not Merely in Appearance, But Actually, by the Operation of the Holy 
  Spirit, in Order to Renovate Us. Strictures on the Conceits of Valentinus and 
  Ebion.
1. For in no other way could we have learned the things of God, unless our 
Master, existing as the Word, had become man. For no other being had the power 
of revealing to us the things of the Father, except His own proper Word. For 
what other person "knew the mind of the Lord," or who else "has become His 
counsellor? " 
Again, we could have learned in no other way than by seeing our Teacher, and 
hearing His voice with our own ears, that, having become imitators of His works 
as well as doers of His words, we may have communion with Him, receiving 
increase from the perfect One, and from Him who is prior to all creation. We-who 
were but lately created by the only best and good Being, by Him also who has the 
gift of immortality, having been formed after His likeness (predestinated, 
according to the prescience of the Father, that we, who had as yet no existence, 
might come into being), and made the first-fruits of creation 
-have received, in the times known beforehand, [the blessings of salvation] 
according to the ministration of the Word, who is perfect in all things, as the 
mighty Word, and very man, who, redeeming us by His own blood in a manner 
consonant to reason, gave Himself as a redemption for those who had been led 
into captivity. And since the apostasy tyrannized over us unjustly, and, though 
we were by nature the property of the omnipotent God, alienated us contrary to 
nature, rendering us its own disciples, the Word of God, powerful in all things, 
and not defective with regard to His own justice, did righteously turn against 
that apostasy, and redeem from it His own property, not by violent means, as the 
[apostasy] had obtained dominion over us at the beginning, when it insatiably 
snatched away what was not its own, but by means of persuasion, as became a God 
of counsel, who does not use violent means to obtain what He desires; so that 
neither should justice be infringed upon, nor the ancient handiwork of God go to 
destruction. Since the Lord thus has redeemed us through His own blood, giving 
His soul for our souls, and His flesh for our flesh, 
and has also poured out the Spirit of the Father for the union and communion of 
God and man, imparting indeed God to men by means of the Spirit, and, on the 
other hand, attaching man to God by His own incarnation, and bestowing upon us 
at His coming immortality durably and truly, by means of communion with God,-all 
the doctrines of the heretics fall to ruin.
2. Vain indeed are those who allege that He appeared in mere seeming. For 
these things were not done in appearance only, but in actual reality. But if He 
did appear as a man, when He was not a man, neither could the Holy Spirit have 
rested upon Him,-an occurrence which did actually take place-as the Spirit is 
invisible; nor, [in that case], was there any degree of truth in Him, for He was 
not that which He seemed to be. But I have already remarked that Abraham and the 
other prophets beheld Him after a prophetical manner, foretelling in vision what 
should come to pass. If, then, such a being has now appeared in outward 
semblance different from what he was in reality, there has been a certain 
prophetical vision made to men; and another advent of His must be looked forward 
to, in which He shall be such as He has now been seen in a prophetic manner. And 
I have proved already, that it is the same thing to say that He appeared merely 
to outward seeming, and [to affirm] that He received nothing from Mary. For He 
would not have been one truly possessing flesh and blood, by which He redeemed 
us, unless He had summed up in Himself the ancient formation of Adam. Vain 
therefore are the disciples of Valentinus who put forth this opinion, in order 
that they my exclude the flesh from salvation, and cast aside what God has 
fashioned.
3. Vain also are the Ebionites, who do not receive by faith into their soul 
the union of God and man, but who remain in the old leaven of [the natural] 
birth, and who do not choose to understand that the Holy Ghost came upon Mary, 
and the power of the Most High did overshadow her: 
wherefore also what was generated is a holy thing, and the Son of the Most High 
God the Father of all, who effected the incarnation of this being, and showed 
forth a new [kind of] generation; that as by the former generation we inherited 
death, so by this new generation we might inherit life. Therefore do these men 
reject the commixture of the heavenly wine, 
and wish it to be water of the world only, not receiving God so as to have union 
with Him, but they remain in that Adam who had been conquered and was expelled 
from Paradise: not considering that as, at the beginning of our formation in 
Adam, that breath of life which proceeded from God, having been united to what 
had been fashioned, animated the man, and manifested him as a being endowed with 
reason; so also, in [the times of] the end, the Word of the Father and the 
Spirit of God, having become united with the ancient substance of Adam's 
formation, rendered man living and perfect, receptive of the perfect Father, in 
order that as in the natural [Adam] we all were dead, so in the spiritual we may 
all be made alive. 
For never at any time did Adam escape the hands 
of God, to whom the Father speaking, said, "Let Us make man in Our image, after 
Our likeness." And for this reason in the last times (fine), not by the 
will of the flesh, nor by the will of man, but by the good pleasure of the 
Father, 
His hands formed a living man, in order that Adam might be created [again] after 
the image and likeness of God.

Chapter II.-When Christ Visited Us 
  in His Grace, He Did Not Come to What Did Not Belong to Him: Also, by Shedding 
  His True Blood for Us, and Exhibiting to Us His True Flesh in the Eucharist, 
  He Conferred Upon Our Flesh the Capacity of Salvation.
1. And vain likewise are those who say that God came to those things which 
did not belong to Him, as if covetous of another's property; in order that He 
might deliver up that man who had been created by another, to that God who had 
neither made nor formed anything, but who also was deprived from the beginning 
of His own proper formation of men. The advent, therefore, of Him whom these men 
represent as coming to the things of others, was not righteous; nor did He truly 
redeem us by His own blood, if He did not really become man, restoring to His 
own handiwork what was said [of it] in the beginning, that man was made after 
the image and likeness of God; not snatching away by stratagem the property of 
another, but taking possession of His own in a righteous and gracious manner. As 
far as concerned the apostasy, indeed, He redeems us righteously from it by His 
own blood; but as regards us who have been redeemed, [He does this] graciously. 
For we have given nothing to Him previously, nor does He desire anything from 
us, as if He stood in need of it; but we do stand in need of fellowship with 
Him. And for this reason it was that He graciously poured Himself out, that He 
might gather us into the bosom of the Father.
2. But vain in every respect are they who despise the entire dispensation of 
God, and disallow the salvation of the flesh, and treat with contempt its 
regeneration, maintaining that it is not capable of incorruption. But if this 
indeed do not attain salvation, then neither did the Lord redeem us with His 
blood, nor is the cup of the Eucharist the communion of His blood, nor the bread 
which we break the communion of His body. 
For blood can only come from veins and flesh, and whatsoever else makes up the 
substance of man, such as the Word of God was actually made. By His own blood he 
redeemed us, as also His apostle declares, "In whom we have redemption through 
His blood, even the remission of sins." 
And as we are His members, we are also nourished by means of the creation (and 
He Himself grants the creation to us, for He causes His sun to rise, and sends 
rain when He wills 
). He has acknowledged the cup (which is a part of the creation) as His own 
blood, from which He bedews our blood; and the bread (also a part of the 
creation) He has established as His own body, from which He gives increase to 
our bodies. 

3. When, therefore, the mingled cup and the manufactured bread receives the 
Word of God, and the Eucharist of the blood and the body of Christ is 
made, 
from which things the substance of our flesh is increased and supported, how can 
they affirm that the flesh is incapable of receiving the gift of God, which is 
life eternal, which [flesh] is nourished from the body and blood of the Lord, 
and is a member of Him?-even as the blessed Paul declares in his Epistle to the 
Ephesians, that "we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His 
bones." 
He does not speak these words of some spiritual and invisible man, for a spirit 
has not bones nor flesh; 
but [he refers to] that dispensation [by which the Lord became] an actual man, 
consisting of flesh, and nerves, and bones,-that [flesh] which is nourished by 
the cup which is His blood, and receives increase from the bread which is His 
body. And just as a cutting from the vine planted in the ground fructifies in 
its season, or as a corn of wheat falling into the earth and becoming 
decomposed, rises with manifold increase by the Spirit of God, who contains all 
things, and then, through the wisdom of God, serves for the use of men, and 
having received the Word of God, becomes the Eucharist, which is the body and 
blood of Christ; so also our bodies, being nourished by it, and deposited in the 
earth, and suffering decomposition there, shall rise at their appointed time, 
the Word of God granting them resurrection to the glory of God, even the Father, 
who freely gives to this mortal immortality, and to this corruptible 
incorruption, 
because the strength of God is made perfect in weakness, 
in order that we may never become puffed up, as if we had life from ourselves, 
and exalted against God, our minds becoming ungrateful; but learning by 
experience that we possess eternal duration from the excelling power of this 
Being, not from our own nature, we may neither undervalue that glory which 
surrounds God as He is, nor be ignorant of our own nature, but that we may know 
what God can effect, and what benefits man receives, and thus never wander from 
the true comprehension of things as they are, that is, both with regard to God 
and with regard to man. And might it not be the case, perhaps, as I have already 
observed, that for this purpose God permitted our resolution into the common 
dust of mortality, 
that we, being instructed by every mode, may be accurate in all things for the 
future, being ignorant neither of God nor of ourselves? 

Chapter III.-He Power and Glory of 
  God Shine Forth in the Weakness of Human Flesh, as He Will Render Our Body a 
  Participator of the Resurrection and of Immortality, Although He Has Formed It 
  from the Dust of the Earth; He Will Also Bestow Upon It the Enjoyment of 
  Immortality, Just as He Grants It This Short Life in Common with the 
  Soul.
1. The Apostle Paul has, moreover, in the most lucid manner, pointed out that 
man has been delivered over to his own infirmity, lest, being uplifted, he might 
fall away from the truth. Thus he says in the second [Epistle] to the 
Corinthians: "And lest I should be lifted up by the sublimity of the 
revelations, there was given unto me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of 
Satan to buffet me. And upon this I besought the Lord three times, that it might 
depart from me. But he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for 
strength is made perfect in weakness. Gladly therefore shall I rather glory in 
infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me." 
What, therefore? (as some may exclaim: ) did the Lord wish, in that case, that 
His apostles should thus undergo buffering, and that he should endure such 
infirmity? Even so it was; the word says it. For strength is made perfect in 
weakness, rendering him a better man who by means of his infirmity becomes 
acquainted with the power of God. For how could a man have learned that he is 
himself an infirm being, and mortal by nature, but that God is immortal and 
powerful, unless he had learned by experience what is in both? For there is 
nothing evil in learning one's infirmities by endurance; yea, rather, it has 
even the beneficial effect of preventing him from forming an undue opinion of 
his own nature (non aberrare in natura sua). But the being lifted up 
against God, and taking His glory to one's self, rendering man ungrateful, has 
brought much evil upon him. [And thus, I say, man must learn both things by 
experience], that he may not be destitute of truth and love either towards 
himself or his Creator. 
But the experience of both confers upon him the true knowledge as to God and 
man, and increases his love towards God. Now, where there exists an increase of 
love, there a greater glory is wrought out by the power of God for those who 
love Him.
2. Those men, therefore, set aside the power of God, and do not consider what 
the word declares, when they dwell upon the infirmity of the flesh, but do not 
take into consideration the power of Him who raises it up from the dead. For if 
He does not vivify what is mortal, and does not bring back the corruptible to 
incorruption, He is not a God of power. But that He is powerful in all these 
respects, we ought to perceive from our origin, inasmuch as God, taking dust 
from the earth, formed man. And surely it is much more difficult and incredible, 
from non-existent bones, and nerves, and veins, and the rest of man's 
organization, to bring it about that all this should be, and to make man an 
animated and rational creature, than to re-integrate again that which had been 
created and then afterwards decomposed into earth (for the reasons already 
mentioned), having thus passed into those [elements] from which man, who had no 
previous existence, was formed. For He who in the beginning caused him to have 
being who as yet was not, just when He pleased, shall much more reinstate again 
those who had a former existence, when it is His will [that they should inherit] 
the life granted by Him. And that flesh shall also be found fit for and capable 
of receiving the power of God, which at the beginning received the skilful 
touches of God; so that one part became the eye for seeing; another, the ear for 
hearing; another, the hand for feeling and working; another, the sinews 
stretched out everywhere, and holding the limbs together; another, arteries and 
veins, passages for the blood and the air; 
another, the various internal organs; another, the blood, which is the bond of 
union between soul and body. But why go [on in this strain]? Numbers would fail 
to express the multiplicity of parts in the human frame, which was made in no 
other way than by the great wisdom of God. But those things which partake of the 
skill and wisdom of God, do also partake of His power.
3. The flesh, therefore, is not destitute [of participation] in the 
constructive wisdom and power of God. But if the power of Him who is the 
bestower of life is made perfect in weakness-that is, in the flesh-let them 
inform us, when they maintain the incapacity of flesh to receive the life 
granted by God, whether they do say these things as being living men at present, 
and partakers of life, or acknowledge that, having no part in life whatever, 
they are at the present moment dead men. And if they really are dead men, how is 
it that they move about, and speak, and perform those other functions which are 
not the actions of the dead, but of the living? But if they are now alive, and 
if their whole body partakes of life, how can they venture the assertion that 
the flesh is not qualified to be a partaker of life, when they do confess that 
they have life at the present moment? It is just as if anybody were to take up a 
sponge full of water, or a torch on fire, and to declare that the sponge could 
not possibly partake of the water, or the torch of the fire. In this very manner 
do those men, by alleging that they are alive and bear life about in their 
members, contradict themselves afterwards, when they represent these members as 
not being capable of [receiving] life. But if the present temporal life, which 
is of such an inferior nature to eternal life, can nevertheless effect so much 
as to quicken our mortal members, why should not eternal life, being much more 
powerful than this, vivify the flesh, which has already held converse with, and 
been accustomed to sustain, life? For that the flesh can really partake of life, 
is shown from the fact of it; being alive; for it lives on, as long as it is 
God's purpose that it should do so. It is manifest, too, that God has the power 
to confer life upon it, inasmuch as He grants life to us who are in existence. 
And, therefore, since the Lord has power to infuse life into what He has 
fashioned, and since the flesh is capable of being quickened, what remains to 
prevent its participating in incorruption, which is a blissful and never-ending 
life granted by God?

Chapter IV.-Those Persons are 
  Deceived Who Feign Another God the Father Besides the Creator of the World; 
  For He Must Have Been Feeble and Useless, or Else Malignant and Full of Envy, 
  If He Be Either Unable or Unwilling to Extend External Life to Our 
  Bodies.
1. Those persons who feign the existence of another Father beyond the 
Creator, and who term him the good God, do deceive themselves; for they 
introduce him as a feeble, worthless, and negligent being, not to say malign and 
full of envy, inasmuch as they affirm that our bodies are not quickened by him. 
For when they say of things which it is manifest to all do remain immortal, such 
as the spirit and the soul, and such other things, that they are quickened by 
the Father, but that another thing [viz. the body] which is quickened in no 
different manner than by God granting [life] to it, is abandoned by life,-[they 
must either confess] that this proves their Father to be weak and powerless, or 
else envious and malignant. For since the Creator does even here quicken our 
mortal bodies, and promises them resurrection by the prophets, as I have pointed 
out; who [in that case] is shown to be more powerful, stronger, or truly good? 
Whether is it the Creator who vivifies the whole man, or is it their Father, 
falsely so called? He feigns to be the quickener of those things which are 
immortal by nature, to which things life is always present by their very nature; 
but he does not benevolently quicken those things which required his assistance, 
that they might live, but leaves them carelessly to fall under the power of 
death. Whether is it the case, then, that their Father does not bestow life upon 
them when he has the power of so doing, or is it that he does not possess the 
power? If, on the one hand, it is because he cannot, he is, upon that 
supposition, not a powerful being, nor is he more perfect than the Creator; for 
the Creator grants, as we must perceive, what He is unable to afford. But 
if, on the other hand, [it be that he does not grant this] when he has the power 
of so doing, then he is proved to be not a good, but an envious and malignant 
Father.
2. If, again, they refer to any cause on account of which their Father does 
not impart life to bodies, then that cause must necessarily appear superior to 
the Father, since it restrains Him from the exercise of His benevolence; and His 
benevolence will thus be proved weak, on account of that cause which they bring 
forward. Now every one must perceive that bodies are capable of receiving life. 
For they live to the extent that God pleases that they should live; and that 
being so, the [heretics] cannot maintain that [these bodies] are utterly 
incapable of receiving life. If, therefore, on account of necessity and any 
other cause, those [bodies] which are capable of participating in life are not 
vivified, their Father shall be the slave of necessity and that cause, and not 
therefore a free agent, having His will under His own control.

Chapter V.-The Prolonged Life of the 
  Ancients, the Translation of Elijah and of Enoch in Their Own Bodies, as Well 
  as the Preservation of Jonah, of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the Midst 
  of Extreme Peril, are Clear Demonstrations that God Can Raise Up Our Bodies to 
  Life Eternal.
1. [In order to learn] that bodies did continue in existence for a lengthened 
period, as long as it was God's good pleasure that they should flourish, let 
[these heretics] read the Scriptures, and they will find that our predecessors 
advanced beyond seven hundred, eight hundred, and nine hundred years of age; and 
that their bodies kept pace with the protracted length of their days, and 
participated in life as long as God willed that they should live. But why do I 
refer to these men? For Enoch, when he pleased God, was translated in the same 
body in which he did please Him, thus pointing out by anticipation the 
translation of the just. Elijah, too, was caught up [when he was yet] in the 
substance of the [natural] form; thus exhibiting in prophecy the assumption of 
those who are spiritual, and that nothing stood in the way of their body being 
translated and caught up. For by means of the very same hands through which they 
were moulded at the beginning, did they receive this translation and assumption. 
For in Adam the hands of God had become accustomed to set in order, to rule, and 
to sustain His own workmanship, and to bring it and place it where they pleased. 
Where, then, was the first man placed? In paradise certainly, as the Scripture 
declares "And God planted a garden [paradisum] eastward in Eden, and 
there He placed the man whom He had formed." 
And then afterwards when [man] proved disobedient, he was cast out thence into 
this world. Wherefore also the elders who were disciples of the apostles tell us 
that those who were translated were transferred to that place (for paradise has 
been prepared for righteous men, such as have the Spirit; in which place also 
Paul the apostle, when he was caught up, heard words which are unspeakable as 
regards us in our present condition 
), and that there shall they who have been translated remain until the 
consummation [of all things], as a prelude to immortality.
2. If, however, any one imagine it impossible that men should survive for 
such a length of time, and that Elias was not caught up in the flesh, but that 
his flesh was consumed in the fiery chariot, let him consider that Jonah, when 
he had been cast into the deep, and swallowed down into the whale's belly, was 
by the command of God again thrown out safe upon the land. 
And then, again, when Ananias, Azarias, and Misael were cast into the furnace of 
fire sevenfold heated, they sustained no harm whatever, neither was the smell of 
fire perceived upon them. As, therefore, the hand of God was present with them, 
working out marvellous things in their case-[things] impossible [to be 
accomplished] by man's nature-what wonder was it, if also in the case of those 
who were translated it performed something wonderful, working in obedience to 
the will of God, even the Father? Now this is the Son of God, as the Scripture 
represents Nebuchadnezzar the king as having said, "Did not we cast three men 
bound into the furnace? and, lo, I do see four walking in the midst of the fire, 
and the fourth is like the Son of God." 
Neither the nature of any created thing, therefore, nor the weakness of the 
flesh, can prevail against the will of God. For God is not subject to created 
things, but created things to God; and all things yield obedience to His will. 
Wherefore also the Lord declares, "The things which are impossible with men, are 
possible with God." 
As, therefore, it might seem to the men of the present day, who are ignorant of 
God's appointment, to be a thing incredible and impossible that any man could 
live for such a number of years, yet those who were before us did live [to such 
an age], and those who were translated do live as an earnest of the future 
length of days; and [as it might also appear impossible] that from the whale's 
belly and from the fiery furnace men issued forth unhurt, yet they nevertheless 
did so, led forth as it were by the hand of God, for the purpose of declaring 
His power: so also now, although some, not knowing the power and promise of God, 
may oppose their own salvation, deeming it impossible for God, who raises up the 
dead; to have power to confer upon them eternal duration, yet the scepticism of 
men of this stamp shall not render the faithfulness of God of none effect.

Chapter VI.-God Will Bestow 
  Salvation Upon the Whole Nature of Man, Consisting of Body and Soul in Close 
  Union, Since the Word Took It Upon Him, and Adorned with the Gifts of the Holy 
  Spirit, of Whom Our Bodies Are, and are Termed, the Temples.
1. Now God shall be glorified in His handiwork, fitting it so as to be 
conformable to, and modelled after, His own Son. For by the hands of the Father, 
that is, by the Son and the Holy Spirit, man, and not [merely] a part of 
man, was made in the likeness of God. Now the soul and the spirit are certainly 
a part of the man, but certainly not the man; for the perfect man 
consists in the commingling and the union of the soul receiving the spirit of 
the Father, and the admixture of that fleshly nature which was moulded after the 
image of God. For this reason does the apostle declare, "We speak wisdom among 
them that are perfect," 
terming those persons "perfect" who have received the Spirit of God, and who 
through the Spirit of God do speak in all languages, as he used Himself also to 
speak. In like manner we do also hear 
many brethren in the Church, who possess prophetic gifts, and who through the 
Spirit speak all kinds of languages, and bring to light for the general benefit 
the hidden things of men, and declare the mysteries of God, whom also the 
apostle terms "spiritual," they being spiritual because they partake of the 
Spirit, and not because their flesh has been stripped off and taken away, and 
because they have become purely spiritual. For if any one take away the 
substance of flesh, that is, of the handiwork [of God], and understand that 
which is purely spiritual, such then would not be a spiritual man but would be 
the spirit of a man, or the Spirit of God. But when the spirit here blended with 
the soul is united to [God's] handiwork, the man is rendered spiritual and 
perfect because of the outpouring of the Spirit, and this is he who was made in 
the image and likeness of God. But if the Spirit be wanting to the soul, he who 
is such is indeed of an animal nature, and being left carnal, shall be an 
imperfect being, possessing indeed the image [of God] in his formation (in 
plasmate), but not receiving the similitude through the Spirit; and thus is 
this being imperfect. Thus also, if any one take away the image and set aside 
the handiwork, he cannot then understand this as being a man, but as either some 
part of a man, as I have already said, or as something else than a man. For that 
flesh which has been moulded is not a perfect man in itself, but the body of a 
man, and part of a man. Neither is the soul itself, considered apart by itself, 
the man; but it is the soul of a man, and part of a man. Neither is the spirit a 
man, for it is called the spirit, and not a man; but the commingling and union 
of all these constitutes the perfect man. And for this cause does the apostle, 
explaining himself, make it clear that the saved man is a complete man as well 
as a spiritual man; saying thus in the first Epistle to the Thessalonians, "Now 
the God of peace sanctify you perfect (perfectos); and may your spirit, 
and soul, and body be preserved whole without complaint to the coming of the 
Lord Jesus Christ." 
Now what was his object in praying that these three-that is, soul, body, and 
spirit-might be preserved to the coming of the Lord, unless he was aware of the 
[future] reintegration and union of the three, and [that they should be heirs 
of] one and the same salvation? For this cause also he declares that those are 
"the perfect" who present unto the Lord the three [component parts] without 
offence. Those, then, are the perfect who have had the Spirit of God remaining 
in them, and have preserved their souls and bodies blameless, holding fast the 
faith of God, that is, that faith which is [directed] towards God, and 
maintaining righteous dealings with respect to their neighbours.
2. Whence also he says, that this handiwork is "the temple of God," thus 
declaring: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of 
God dwelleth in you? If any man, therefore, will defile the temple of God, him 
will God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are." 
Here he manifestly declares the body to be the temple in which the Spirit 
dwells. As also the Lord speaks in reference to Himself, "Destroy this temple, 
and in three days I will raise it up. He spake this, however," it is said, "of 
the temple of His body." 
And not only does he (the apostle) acknowledge our bodies to be a temple, but 
even the temple of Christ, saying thus to the Corinthians, "Know ye not that 
your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and 
make them the members of an harlot? " 
He speaks these things, not in reference to some other spiritual man; for a 
being of such a nature could have nothing to do with an harlot: but he declares 
"our body," that is, the flesh which continues in sanctity and purity, to be 
"the members of Christ; "but that when it becomes one with an harlot, it becomes 
the members of an harlot. And for this reason he said, "If any man defile the 
temple of God, him will God destroy." How then is it not the utmost blasphemy to 
allege, that the temple of God, in which the Spirit of the Father dwells, and 
the members of Christ, do not partake of salvation, but are reduced to 
perdition? Also, that our bodies are raised not from their own substance, but by 
the power of God, he says to the Corinthians, "Now the body is not for 
fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. But God hath both 
raised up the Lord, and shall raise us up by His own power." 


Chapter VII.-Inasmuch as Christ Did 
  Rise in Our Flesh, It Follows that We Shall Be Also Raised in the Same; Since 
  the Resurrection Promised to Us Should Not Be Referred to Spirits Naturally 
  Immortal, But to Bodies in Themselves Mortal.
1. In the same manner, therefore, as Christ did rise in the substance of 
flesh, and pointed out to His disciples the mark of the nails and the opening in 
His side 
(now these are the tokens of that flesh which rose from the dead), so "shall He 
also," it is said, "raise us up by His own power." 
And again to the Romans he says, "But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus 
from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also 
quicken your mortal bodies." 
What, then, are mortal bodies? Can they be souls? Nay, for souls are incorporeal 
when put in comparison with mortal bodies; for God "breathed into the face of 
man the breath of life, and man became a living soul." Now the breath of life is 
an incorporeal thing. And certainly they cannot maintain that the very breath of 
life is mortal. Therefore David says, "My soul also shall live to Him," 
just as if its substance were immortal. Neither, on the other hand, can they say 
that the spirit is the mortal body. What therefore is there left to which we may 
apply the term "mortal body," unless it be the thing that was moulded, that is, 
the flesh, of which it is also said that God will vivify it? For this it is 
which dies and is decomposed, but not the soul or the spirit. For to die is to 
lose vital power, and to become henceforth breathless, inanimate, and devoid of 
motion, and to melt away into those [component parts] from which also it derived 
the commencement of [its] substance. But this event happens neither to the soul, 
for it is the breath of life; nor to the spirit, for the spirit is simple and 
not composite, so that it cannot be decomposed, and is itself the life of those 
who receive it. We must therefore conclude that it is in reference to the flesh 
that death is mentioned; which [flesh], after the soul's departure, becomes 
breathless and inanimate, and is decomposed gradually into the earth from which 
it was taken. This, then, is what is mortal. And it is this of which he also 
says," He shall also quicken your mortal bodies." And therefore in reference to 
it he says, in the first [Epistle] to the Corinthians: "So also is the 
resurrection of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it rises in 
incorruption." 
For he declares, "That which thou sowest cannot be quickened, unless first it 
die." 

2. But what is that which, like a grain of wheat, is sown in the earth and 
decays, unless it be the bodies which are laid in the earth, into which seeds 
are also cast? And for this reason he said, "It is sown in dishonour, it rises 
in glory." 
For what is more ignoble than dead flesh? Or, on the other hand, what is more 
glorious than the same when it arises and partakes of incorruption? "It is sown 
in weakness, it is raised in power: " 
in its own weakness certainly, because since it is earth it goes to earth; but 
[it is quickened] by the power of God, who raises it from the dead. "It is sown 
an animal body, it rises a spiritual body." 
He has taught, beyond all doubt, that such language was not used by him, either 
with reference to the soul or to the spirit, but to bodies that have become 
corpses. For these are animal bodies, that is, [bodies] which partake of life, 
which when they have lost, they succumb to death; then, rising through the 
Spirit's instrumentality, they become spiritual bodies, so that by the Spirit 
they possess a perpetual life. "For now," he says, "we know in part, and we 
prophesy in part, but then face to face." 
And this it is which has been said also by Peter: "Whom having not seen, ye 
love; in whom now also, not seeing, ye believe; and believing, ye shall rejoice 
with joy unspeakable." 
For our face shall see the face of the Lord 
and shall rejoice with joy unspeakable,-that is to say, when it shall behold its 
own Delight.

Chapter VIII.-The Gifts of the Holy 
  Spirit Which We Receive Prepare Us for Incorruption, Render Us Spiritual, and 
  Separate Us from Carnal Men.these Two Classes are Signified by the Clean and 
  Unclean Animals in the Legal Dispensation.
1. But we do now receive a certain portion of His Spirit, tending towards 
perfection, and preparing us for incorruption, being little by little accustomed 
to receive and bear God; which also the apostle terms "an earnest," that is, a 
part of the honour which has been promised us by God, where he says in the 
Epistle to the Ephesians, "In which ye also, having heard the word of truth, the 
Gospel of your salvation, believing in which we have been sealed with the Holy 
Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance." 
This earnest, therefore, thus dwelling in us, renders us spiritual even now, and 
the mortal is swallowed up by immortality. 
"For ye," he declares, "are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that 
the Spirit of God dwell in you." 
This, however does not take place by a casting away of the flesh, but by the 
impartation of the Spirit. For those to whom he was writing were not without 
flesh, but they were those who had received the Spirit of God, "by which we cry, 
Abba, Father." 
If therefore, at the present time, having the earnest, we do cry, "Abba, 
Father," what shall it be when, on rising again, we behold Him face to face; 
when all the members shall burst out into a continuous hymn of triumph, 
glorifying Him who raised them from the dead, and gave the gift of eternal life? 
For if the earnest, gathering man into itself, does even now cause him to cry, 
"Abba, Father," what shall the complete grace of the Spirit effect, which shall 
be given to men by God? It will render us like unto Him, and accomplish the 
will 
of the Father; for it shall make man after the image and likeness of God. 
2. Those persons, then, who possess the earnest of the Spirit, and who are 
not enslaved by the lusts of the flesh, but are subject to the Spirit, and who 
in all things walk according to the light of reason, does the apostle properly 
term "spiritual," because the Spirit of God dwells in them. Now, spiritual men 
shall not be incorporeal spirits; but our substance, that is, the union of flesh 
and spirit, receiving the Spirit of God, makes up the spiritual man. But those 
who do indeed reject the Spirit's counsel, and are the slaves of fleshly lusts, 
and lead lives contrary to reason, and who, without restraint, plunge headlong 
into their own desires, having no longing after the Divine Spirit, do live after 
the manner of swine and of dogs; these men, [I say], does the apostle very 
properly term "carnal," because they have no thought of anything else except 
carnal things.
3. For the same reason, too, do the prophets compare them to irrational 
animals, on account of the irrationality of their conduct, saying, "They have 
become as horses raging for the females; each one of them neighing after his 
neighbour's wife." 
And again, "Man, when he was in honour, was made like unto cattle." 
This denotes that, for his own fault, he is likened to cattle, by rivalling 
their irrational life. And we also, as the custom is, do designate men of this 
stamp as cattle and irrational beasts.
4. Now the law has figuratively predicted all these, delineating man by the 
[various] animals: 
whatsoever of these, says [the Scripture], have a double hoof and ruminate, it 
proclaims as clean; but whatsoever of them do not possess one or other of these 
[properties], it sets aside by themselves as unclean. Who then are the clean? 
Those who make their way by faith steadily towards the Father and the Son; for 
this is denoted by the steadiness of those which divide the hoof; and they 
meditate day and night upon the words of God, 
that they may be adorned with good works: for this is the meaning of the 
ruminants. The unclean, however, are those which do neither divide the hoof nor 
ruminate; that is, those persons who have neither faith in God, nor do meditate 
on His words: and such is the abomination of the Gentiles. But as to those 
animals which do indeed chew the cud, but have not the double hoof, and are 
themselves unclean, we have in them a figurative description of the Jews, who 
certainly have the words of God in their mouth, but who do not fix their rooted 
stedfastness in the Father and in the Son; wherefore they are an unstable 
generation. For those animals which have the hoof all in one piece easily slip; 
but those which have it divided are more sure-footed, their cleft hoofs 
succeeding each other as they advance, and the one hoof supporting the other. In 
like manner, too, those are unclean which have the double hoof but do not 
ruminate: this is plainly an indication of all heretics, and of those who do not 
meditate on the words of God, neither are adorned with works of righteousness; 
to whom also the Lord says, "Why call ye Me Lord, Lord, and do not the things 
which I say to you? " 
For men of this stamp do indeed say that they believe in the Father and the Son, 
but they never meditate as they should upon the things of God, neither are they 
adorned with works of righteousness; but, as I have already observed, they have 
adopted the lives of swine and of dogs, giving themselves over to filthiness, to 
gluttony, and recklessness of all sorts. Justly, therefore, did the apostle call 
all such "carnal" and "animal," 
-[all those, namely], who through their own unbelief and luxury do not receive 
the Divine Spirit, and in their various phases east out from themselves the 
life-giving Word, and walk stupidly after their own lusts: the prophets, too, 
spake of them as beasts of burden and wild beasts; custom likewise has viewed 
them in the light of cattle and irrational creatures; and the law has pronounced 
them unclean.

Chapter IX.-Showing How that Passage 
  of the Apostle Which the Heretics Pervert, Should Be Understood; Viz., "Flesh 
  and Blood Shall Not Possess the Kingdom of God."
1. Among the other [truths] proclaimed by the apostle, there is also this 
one, "That flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God." 
This is [the passage] which is adduced by all the heretics in support of their 
folly, with an attempt to annoy us, and to point out that the handiwork of God 
is not saved. They do not take this fact into consideration, that there are 
three things out of which, as I have shown, the complete man is composed-flesh, 
soul, and spirit. One of these does indeed preserve and fashion [the man]-this 
is the spirit; while as to another it is united and formed-that is the flesh; 
then [comes] that which is between these two-that is the soul, which sometimes 
indeed, when it follows the spirit, is raised up by it, but sometimes it 
sympathizes with the flesh, and falls into carnal lusts. Those then, as many as 
they be, who have not that which saves and forms [us] into life [eternal], shall 
be, and shall be called, [mere] flesh and blood; for these are they who have not 
the Spirit of God in themselves. Wherefore men of this stamp are spoken of by 
the Lord as "dead; "for, says He, "Let the dead bury their dead," 
because they have not the Spirit which quickens man.
2. On the other hand, as many as fear God and trust in His Son's advent, and 
who through faith do establish the Spirit of God in their hearts,-such men as 
these shall be properly called both "pure," and "spiritual," and "those living 
to God," because they possess the Spirit of the Father, who purifies man, and 
raises him up to the life of God. For as the Lord has testified that "the flesh 
is weak," so [does He also say] that "the spirit is willing." 
For this latter is capable of working out its own suggestions. If, therefore, 
any one admix the ready inclination of the Spirit to be, as it were, a stimulus 
to the infirmity of the flesh, it inevitably follows that what is strong will 
prevail over the weak, so that the weakness of the flesh will be absorbed by the 
strength of the Spirit; and that the man in whom this takes place cannot in that 
case be carnal, but Spiritual, because of the fellowship of the Spirit. Thus it 
is, therefore, that the martyrs bear their witness, and despise death, not after 
the infirmity of the flesh, but because of the readiness of the Spirit. For when 
the infirmity of the flesh is absorbed, it exhibits the Spirit as powerful; and 
again, when the Spirit absorbs the weakness [of the flesh], it possesses the 
flesh as an inheritance in itself, and from both of these is formed a living 
man,-living, indeed, because he partakes of the Spirit, but man, because of the 
substance of flesh.
3. The flesh, therefore, when destitute of the Spirit of God, is dead, not 
having life, and cannot possess the kingdom of God: [it is as] irrational blood, 
like water poured out upon the ground. And therefore he says, "As is the earthy, 
such are they that are earthy." 
But where the Spirit of the Father is, there is a living man; [there is] the 
rational blood preserved by God for the avenging [of those that shed it]; [there 
is] the flesh possessed by the Spirit, forgetful indeed of what belongs to it, 
and adopting the quality of the Spirit, being made conformable to the Word of 
God. And on this account he (the apostle) declares, "As we have borne the image 
of him who is of the earth, we shall also bear the image of Him who is from 
heaven." 
What, therefore, is the earthly? That which was fashioned. And what is the 
heavenly? The Spirit. As therefore he says, when we were destitute of the 
celestial Spirit, we walked in former times in the oldness of the flesh, not 
obeying God; so now let us, receiving the Spirit, walk in newness of life, 
obeying God. Inasmuch, therefore, as without the Spirit of God we cannot be 
saved, the apostle exhorts us through faith and chaste conversation to preserve 
the Spirit of God, lest, having become non-participators of the Divine Spirit, 
we lose the kingdom of heaven; and he exclaims, that flesh in itself, and blood, 
cannot possess the kingdom God.
4. If, however, we must speak strictly, [we would say that] the flesh does 
not inherit, but is inherited; as also the Lord declares, "Blessed are the 
meek, for they shall possess the earth by inheritance; " 
as if in the [future] kingdom, the earth, from whence exists the substance Of 
our flesh, is to be possessed by inheritance. This is the reason for His wishing 
the temple (i.e., the flesh) to be clean, that the Spirit of God may take 
delight therein, as a bridegroom with a bride. As, therefore, the bride cannot 
[be said] to wed, but to be wedded, when the bridegroom comes and takes her, so 
also the flesh cannot by itself possess the kingdom of God by inheritance; but 
it can be taken for an inheritance into the kingdom of God. For a living 
person inherits the goods of the deceased; and it is one thing to inherit, 
another to be inherited. The former rules, and exercises power over, and orders 
the things inherited at his will; but the latter things are in a state of 
subjection, are under order, and are ruled over by him who has obtained the 
inheritance. What, therefore, is it that lives? The Spirit of God, doubtless. 
What, again, are the possessions of the deceased? The various parts of the man, 
surely, which rot in the earth. But these are inherited by the Spirit when they 
are translated into the kingdom of heaven. For this cause, too, did Christ die. 
that the Gospel covenant being manifested and known to the whole world, might in 
the first place set free His slaves; and then afterwards, as I have already 
shown, might constitute them heirs of His property, when the Spirit possesses 
them by inheritance. For he who lives inherits, but the flesh is inherited. In 
order that we may not lose life by losing that Spirit which possesses us, the 
apostle, exhorting us to the communion of the Spirit, has said, according to 
reason, in those words already quoted, "That flesh and blood cannot inherit the 
kingdom of God." Just as if he were to say, "Do not err; for unless the Word of 
God dwell with, and the Spirit of the Father be in you, and if ye shall live 
frivolously and carelessly as if ye were this only, viz., mere flesh and blood, 
ye cannot inherit the kingdom of God." 

Chapter X.-By a Comparison Drawn 
  from the Wild Olive-Tree, Whose Quality But Not Whose Nature is Changed by 
  Grafting, He Proves More Important Things; He Points Out Also that Man Without 
  the Spirit is Not Capable of Bringing Forth Fruit, or of Inheriting the 
  Kingdom of God.
1. This truth, therefore, [he declares], in order that we may not reject the 
engrafting of the Spirit while pampering the flesh. "But thou, being a wild 
olive-tree," he says, "hast been grafted into the good olive-tree, and been made 
a partaker of the fatness of the olive-tree. 
As, therefore, when the wild olive has been engrafted, if it remain in its 
former condition, viz., a wild olive, it is "cut off, and cast into the fire; 
" 
but if it takes kindly to the graft, and is changed into the good olive-tree, it 
becomes a fruit-bearing olive, planted, as it were, in a king's park 
(paradiso): so likewise men, if they do truly progress by faith towards 
better things, and receive the Spirit of God, and bring forth the fruit thereof, 
shall be spiritual, as being planted in the paradise of God. But if they cast 
out the Spirit, and remain in their former condition, desirous of being of the 
flesh rather than of the Spirit, then it is very justly said with regard to men 
of this stamp, "That flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God; 
" 
just as if any one were to say that the wild olive is not received into the 
paradise of God. Admirably therefore does the apostle exhibit our nature, and 
God's universal appointment, in his discourse about flesh and blood and the wild 
olive. For as the good olive, if neglected for a certain time, if left to grow 
wild and to run to i wood, does itself become a wild olive; or again, if the 
wild olive be carefully tended and grafted, it naturally reverts to its former 
fruit-bearing condition: so men also, when they become careless, and bring forth 
for fruit the lusts of the flesh like woody produce, are rendered, by their own 
fault, unfruitful in righteousness. For when men sleep, the enemy sows the 
material of tares; 
and for this cause did the Lord command His disciples to be on the watch. 
And again, those persons who are not bringing forth the fruits of righteousness, 
and are, as it were, covered over and lost among brambles, if they use 
diligence, and receive the word of God as a graft, 
arrive at the pristine nature of man-that which was created after the image and 
likeness of God.
2. But as the engrafted wild olive does not certainly lose the substance of 
its wood, but changes the quality of its fruit, and receives another name, being 
now not a wild olive, but a fruit-bearing olive, and is called so; so also, when 
man is grafted in by faith and receives the Spirit of God, he certainly does not 
lose the substance of flesh, but changes the quality of the fruit [brought 
forth, i.e., ] of his works, and receives another name, 
showing that he has become changed for the better, being now not [mere] flesh 
and blood, but a spiritual man, and is called such. Then, again, as the wild 
olive, if it be not grafted in, remains useless to its lord because of its woody 
quality, and is cut down as a tree bearing no fruit, and cast into the fire; so 
also man, if he does not receive through faith the engrafting of the Spirit, 
remains in his old condition, and being [mere] flesh and blood, he cannot 
inherit the kingdom of God. Rightly therefore does the apostle declare, "Flesh 
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; " 
and, "Those who are in the flesh cannot please God: " 
not repudiating [by these words] the substance of flesh, but showing that into 
it the Spirit must be infused. 
And for this reason, he says, "This mortal must put on immortality, and this 
corruptible must put on incorruption." 
And again he declares, "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be 
that the Spirit of God dwell in you." 
He sets this forth still more plainly, where he says, "The body indeed is dead, 
because of sin; but the Spirit is life, because of righteousness. But if the 
Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up 
Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies, because of His 
Spirit dwelling in you." 
And again he says, in the Epistle to the Romans, "For if ye live after the 
flesh, ye shall die." 
[Now by these words] he does not prohibit them from living their lives in the 
flesh, for he was himself in the flesh when he wrote to them; but he cuts away 
the lusts of the flesh, those which bring death upon a man. And for this reason 
he says in continuation, "But if ye through the Spirit do mortify the works of 
the flesh, ye shall live. For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, these are 
the sons of God."

Chapter XI.-Treats Upon the Actions 
  of Carnal and of Spiritual Persons; Also, that the Spiritual Cleansing is Not 
  to Be Referred to the Substance of Our Bodies, But to the Manner of Our Former 
  Life.
1. [The apostle], foreseeing the wicked speeches of unbelievers, has 
particularized the works which he terms carnal; and he explains himself, lest 
any room for doubt be left to those who do dishonestly pervert his meaning, thus 
saying in the Epistle to the Galatians: "Now the works of the flesh are 
manifest, which are adulteries, fornications, uncleanness, luxuriousness, 
idolatries, witchcrafts, 
hatreds, contentions jealousies, wraths, emulations, animosities, irritable 
speeches, dissensions, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, carousings, and such 
like; of which I warn you, as also I have warned you, that they who do such 
things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." 
Thus does he point out to his hearers in a more explicit manner what it is [he 
means when he declares], "Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God." 
For they who do these things, since they do indeed walk after the flesh, have 
not the power of living unto God. And then, again, he proceeds to tell us the 
spiritual actions which vivify a man, that is, the engrafting of the Spirit; 
thus saying, "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, 
goodness, benignity, faith, meekness, continence, chastity: against these there 
is no law." 
As, therefore, he who has gone forward to the better things, and has brought 
forth the fruit of the Spirit, is saved altogether because of the communion of 
the Spirit; so also he who has continued in the aforesaid works of the flesh, 
being truly reckoned as carnal, because he did not receive the Spirit of God, 
shall not have power to inherit the kingdom of heaven. As, again, the same 
apostle testifies, saying to the Corinthians, "Know ye not that the unrighteous 
shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not err," he says: "neither 
fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of 
themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor revilers, nor rapacious 
persons, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And these ye indeed have been; but ye 
have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God." 
He shows in the clearest manner through what things it is that man goes to 
destruction, if he has continued to live after the flesh; and then, on the other 
hand, [he points out] through what things he is saved. Now he says that the 
things which save are the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of our 
God.
2. Since, therefore, in that passage he recounts those works of the flesh 
which are without the Spirit, which bring death [upon their doers], he exclaimed 
at the end of his Epistle, in accordance with what he had already declared, "And 
as we have borne the image of him who is of the earth, we shall also bear the 
image of Him who is from heaven. For this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood 
cannot inherit the kingdom of God." 
Now this which he says, "as we have borne the image of him who is of the earth," 
is analogous to what has been declared, "And such indeed ye were; but ye have 
been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name 
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God." When, therefore, did we 
bear the image of him who is of the earth? Doubtless it was when those actions 
spoken of as "works of the flesh" used to be wrought in us. And then, again, 
when [do we bear] the image of the heavenly? Doubtless when he says, "Ye have 
been washed," believing in the name of the Lord, and receiving His Spirit. Now 
we have washed away, not the substance of our body, nor the image of our 
[primary] formation, but the former vain conversation. In these members, 
therefore, in which we were going to destruction by working the works of 
corruption, in these very members are we made alive by working the works of the 
Spirit.

Chapter XII.-Of the Difference 
  Between Life and Death; Of the Breath of Life and the Vivifying Spirit: Also 
  How It is that the Substance of Flesh Revives Which Once Was 
Dead.
1. For as the flesh is capable of corruption, so is it also of incorruption; 
and as it is of death, so is it also of life. These two do mutually give way to 
each other; and both cannot remain in the same place, but one is driven out by 
the other, and the presence of the one destroys that of the other. If, then, 
when death takes possession of a man, it drives life away from him, and proves 
him to be dead, much more does life, when it has obtained power over the man, 
drive out death, and restore him as living unto God. For if death brings 
mortality, why should not life, when it comes, vivify man? Just as Esaias the 
prophet says, "Death devoured when it had prevailed." 
And again, "God has wiped away every tear from every face." Thus that former 
life is expelled, because it was not given by the Spirit, but by the breath.
2. For the breath of life, which also rendered man an animated being, is one 
thing, and the vivifying Spirit another, which also caused him to become 
spiritual. And for this reason Isaiah said, "Thus saith the Lord, who made 
heaven and established it, who founded the earth and the things therein, and 
gave breath to the people upon it, and Spirit to those walking upon it; " 
thus telling us that breath is indeed given in common to all people upon earth, 
but that the Spirit is theirs alone who tread down earthly desires. And 
therefore Isaiah himself, distinguishing the things already mentioned, again 
exclaims, "For the Spirit shall go forth from Me, and I have made every 
breath." 
Thus does he attribute the Spirit as peculiar to God which in the last times He 
pours forth upon the human race by the adoption of sons; but [he shows] that 
breath was common throughout the creation, and points it out as something 
created. Now what has been made is a different thing from him who makes it. The 
breath, then, is temporal, but the Spirit eternal. The breath, too, increases 
[in strength] for a short period, and continues for a certain time; after that 
it takes its departure, leaving its former abode destitute of breath. But when 
the Spirit pervades the man within and without, inasmuch as it continues there, 
it never leaves him. "But that is not first which is spiritual," says the 
apostle, speaking this as if with reference to us human beings; "but that is 
first which is animal, afterwards that which is spiritual," 
in accordance with reason. For there had been a necessity that, in the first 
place, a human being should be fashioned, and that what was fashioned should 
receive the soul; afterwards that it should thus receive the communion of the 
Spirit. Wherefore also "the first Adam was made" by the Lord "a living soul, the 
second Adam a quickening spirit." 
As, then, he who was made a living soul forfeited life when he turned aside to 
what was evil, so, on the other hand, the same individual, when he reverts to 
what is good, and receives the quickening Spirit, shall find life.
3. For it is not one thing which dies and another which is quickened, as 
neither is it one thing Which is lost and another which is found, but the Lord 
came seeking for that same sheep which had been lost. What was it, then, which 
was dead? Undoubtedly it was the substance of the flesh; the same, too, which 
had lost the breath of life, and had become breathless and dead. This same, 
therefore, was what the Lord came to quicken, that as in Adam we do all die, as 
being of an animal nature, in Christ we may all live, as being spiritual, not 
laying aside God's handiwork, but the lusts of the flesh, and receiving the Holy 
Spirit; as the apostle says in the Epistle to the Colossians: "Mortify, 
therefore, your members which are upon the earth." And what these are he himself 
explains: "Fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence; 
and covetousness, which is idolatry." 
The laying aside of these is what the apostle preaches; and he declares that 
those who do such things, as being merely flesh and blood, cannot inherit the 
kingdom of heaven. For their soul, tending towards what is worse, and descending 
to earthly lusts, has become a partaker in the same designation which belongs to 
these [lusts, viz., "earthly"], which, when the apostle commands us to lay 
aside, he says in the same Epistle, "Cast ye off the old man with his 
deeds." 
But when he said this, he does not remove away the ancient formation [of man]; 
for in that case it would be incumbent on us to rid ourselves of its company by 
committing suicide.
4. But the apostle himself also, being one who had been formed in a womb, and 
had issued thence, wrote to us, and confessed in his Epistle to the Philippians 
that "to live in the flesh was the fruit of [his] work; " 
thus expressing himself. Now the final result of the work of the Spirit is the 
salvation of the flesh. 
For what other visible fruit is there of the invisible Spirit, than the 
rendering of the flesh mature and capable of incorruption? If then [he says], 
"To live in the flesh, this is the result of labour to me," he did not surely 
contemn the substance of flesh in that passage where he said, "Put ye off the 
old man with his works; " 
but he points out that we should lay aside our former conversation, that which 
waxes old and becomes corrupt; and for this reason he goes on to say, "And put 
ye on the new man, that which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of Him 
who created him." In this, therefore, that he says, "which is renewed in 
knowledge," he demonstrates that he, the selfsame man who was in ignorance in 
times past, that is, in ignorance of God, is renewed by that knowledge which has 
respect to Him. For the knowledge of God renews man. And when he says, "after 
the image of the Creator," he sets forth the recapitulation of the same man, who 
was at the beginning made after the likeness of God.
5. And that he, the apostle, was the very same person who had been born from 
the womb, that is, of the ancient substance of flesh, he does himself declare in 
the Epistle to the Galatians: "But when it pleased God, who separated me from my 
mother's womb, and called me by His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might 
preach Him among the Gentiles," 
it was not, as I have already observed, one person who had been born from the 
womb, and another who preached the Gospel of the Son of God; but that same 
individual who formerly was ignorant, and used to persecute the Church, when the 
revelation was made to him from heaven, and the Lord conferred with him, as I 
have pointed out in the third book, 
preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was crucified under 
Pontius Pilate, his former ignorance being driven out by his subsequent 
knowledge: just as the blind men whom the Lord healed did certainly lose their 
blindness, but received the substance of their eyes perfect, and obtained the 
power of vision in the very same eyes with which they formerly did not see; the 
darkness being merely driven away by the power of vision, while the substance of 
the eyes was retained, in order that, by means of those eyes through which they 
had not seen, exercising again the visual power, they might give thanks to Him 
who had restored them again to sight. And thus, also, he whose withered hand was 
healed, and all who were healed generally, did not change those parts of their 
bodies which had at their birth come forth from the womb, but simply obtained 
these anew in a healthy condition.
6. For the Maker of all things, the Word of God, who did also from the 
beginning form man, when He found His handiwork impaired by wickedness, 
performed upon it all kinds of healing. At one time [He did so], as regards each 
separate member, as it is found in His own handiwork; and at another time He did 
once for all restore man sound and whole in all points, preparing him perfect 
for Himself unto the resurrection. For what was His object in healing 
[different] portions of the flesh, and restoring them to their original 
condition, if those parts which had been healed by Him were not in a position to 
obtain salvation? For if it was [merely] a temporary benefit which He conferred, 
He granted nothing of importance to those who were the subjects of His healing. 
Or how can they maintain that the flesh is incapable of receiving the life which 
flows from Him, when it received healing from Him? For life is brought about 
through healing, and incorruption through life. He, therefore, who confers 
healing, the same does also confer life; and He [who gives] life, also surrounds 
His own handiwork with incorruption.

Chapter XIII.-In the Dead Who Were 
  Raised by Christ We Possess the Highest Proof of the Resurrection; And Our 
  Hearts are Shown to Be Capable of Life Eternal, Because They Can Now Receive 
  the Spirit of God.
1. Let our opponents-that is, they who speak against their own 
salvation-inform us [as to this point]: The deceased daughter of the high 
priest; 
the widow's dead son, who was being carded out [to burial] near the gate [of the 
city]; 
and Lazarus, who had lain four days in the tomb, 
-in what bodies did they rise again? In those same, no doubt, in which they had 
also died. For if it were not in the very same, then certainly those same 
individuals who had died did not rise again. For [the Scripture] says, "The Lord 
took the hand of the dead man, and said to him, Young man, I say unto thee, 
Arise. And the dead man sat up, and He commanded that something should be given 
him to eat; and He delivered him to his mother." 
Again, He called Lazarus "with a loud voice, saying, Lazarus, come forth; and he 
that was dead came forth bound with bandages, feet and hands." This was 
symbolical of that man who had been bound in sins. And therefore the Lord said, 
"Loose him, and let him depart." As, therefore, those who were healed were made 
whole in those members which had in times past been afflicted; and the dead rose 
in the identical bodies, their limbs and bodies receiving health, and that life 
which was granted by the Lord, who prefigures eternal things by temporal, and 
shows that it is He who is Himself able to extend both healing and life to His 
handiwork, that His words concerning its [future] resurrection may also be 
believed; so also at the end, when the Lord utters His voice "by the last 
trumpet," 
the dead shall be raised, as He Himself declares: "The hour shall come, in which 
all the dead which are in the tombs shall hear the voice of the Son of man, and 
shall come forth; those that have done good to the resurrection of life, and 
those that have done evil to the resurrection of judgment." 

2. Vain, therefore, and truly miserable, are those who do not choose to see 
what is so manifest and clear, but shun the light of truth, blinding themselves 
like the tragic Oedipus. And as those who are not practised in wrestling, when 
they contend with others, laying hold with a determined grasp of some part of 
[their opponent's] body, really fall by means of that which they grasp, yet when 
they fall, imagine that they are gaining the victory, because they have 
obstinately kept their hold upon that part which they seized at the outset, and 
besides falling, become subjects of ridicule; so is it with respect to that 
[favourite] expression of the heretics: "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the 
kingdom of God; "while taking two expressions of Paul's, without having 
perceived the apostle's meaning, or examined critically the force of the terms, 
but keeping fast hold of the mere expressions by themselves, they die in 
consequence of their influence (peri\ 
au0ta/&Eaxute\), overturning as far as in them lies the entire 
dispensation of God.
3. For thus they will allege that this passage refers to the flesh strictly 
so called, and not to fleshly works, as I have pointed out, so representing the 
apostle as contradicting himself. For immediately following, in the same 
Epistle, he says conclusively, speaking thus in reference to the flesh: "For 
this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on 
immortality. So, when this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be 
brought to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O 
death, where is thy sting? O death, where is thy victory? " 
Now these words shall be appropriately said at the time when this mortal and 
corruptible flesh, which is subject to death, which also is pressed down by a 
certain dominion of death, rising up into life, shall put on incorruption and 
immortality. For then, indeed, shall death be truly vanquished, when that flesh 
which is held down by it shall go forth from under its dominion. And again, to 
the Philippians he says: "But our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we 
look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, who shall transfigure the body of our 
humiliation conformable to the body of His glory, even as He is able (ita ut 
possit) according to the working of His own power." 
What, then, is this "body of humiliation" which the Lord shall transfigure, [so 
as to be] conformed to "the body of His glory? "Plainly it is this body composed 
of flesh, which is indeed humbled when it falls into the earth. Now its 
transformation [takes place thus], that while it is mortal and corruptible, it 
becomes immortal and incorruptible, not after its own proper substance, but 
after the mighty working of the Lord, who is able to invest the mortal with 
immortality, and the corruptible with incorruption. And therefore he 
says, 
"that mortality may be swallowed up of life.He who has perfected us for this 
very thing is God, who also has given unto us the earnest of the Spirit." 
He uses these words most manifestly in reference to the flesh; for the soul is 
not mortal, neither is the spirit. Now, what is mortal shall be swallowed up of 
life, when the flesh is dead no longer, but remains living and incorruptible, 
hymning the praises of God, who has perfected us for this very thing. In order, 
therefore, that we may be perfected for this, aptly does he say to the 
Corinthians, "Glorify God in your body." 
Now God is He who gives rise to immortality.
4. That he uses these words with respect to the body of flesh, and to none 
other, he declares to the Corinthians manifestly, indubitably, and free from all 
ambiguity: "Always bearing about in our body the dying of Jesus, 
that also the life of Jesus Christ might be manifested in our body. For if we 
who live are delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, it is that the life of Jesus 
may also be manifested in our mortal flesh." 
And that the Spirit lays hold on the flesh, he says in the same Epistle, "That 
ye axe the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with 
the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables 
of the heart." 
If, therefore, in the present time, fleshly hearts are made partakers of the 
Spirit, what is there astonishing if, in the resurrection, they receive that 
life which is granted by the Spirit? Of which resurrection the apostle speaks in 
the Epistle to the Philippians: "Having been made conformable to His death, if 
by any means I might attain to the resurrection which is from the dead." 
In what other mortal flesh, therefore, can life be understood as being 
manifested, unless in that substance which is also put to death on account of 
that confession which is made of God?-as he has himself declared, "If, as a man, 
I have fought with beasts 
at Ephesus, what advantageth it me if the dead rise not? For if the dead rise 
not, neither has Christ risen. Now, if Christ has not risen, our preaching is 
vain, and your faith is vain. In that case, too, we are found false witnesses 
for God, since we have testified that He raised up Christ, whom [upon that 
supposition] He did not raise up. 
For if the dead rise not, neither has Christ risen. But if Christ be not risen, 
your faith is vain, since ye are yet in your sins. Therefore those who have 
fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in this life only we have hope in 
Christ, we are more miserable than all men. But now Christ has risen from the 
dead, the first-fruits of those that sleep; for as by man [came] death, by man 
also [came] the resurrection of the dead." 

5. In all these passages, therefore, as I have already said, these men must 
either allege that the apostle expresses opinions contradicting himself, with 
respect to that statement, "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; 
"or, on the other hand, they will be forced to make perverse and crooked 
interpretations of all the passages, so as to overturn and alter the sense of 
the words. For what sensible thing can they say, if they endeavour to interpret 
otherwise this which he writes: "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, 
and this mortal put on immortality; " 
and, "That the life of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh; " 
and all the other passages in which the apostle does manifestly and clearly 
declare the resurrection and incorruption of the flesh? And thus shall they be 
compelled to put a false interpretation upon passages such as these, they who do 
not choose to understand one correctly.

Chapter XIV.-Unless the Flesh Were 
  to Be Saved, the Word Would Not Have Taken Upon Him Flesh of the Same 
  Substance as Ours: from This It Would Follow that Neither Should We Have Been 
  Reconciled by Him.
1. And inasmuch as the apostle has not pronounced against the very substance 
of flesh and blood, that it cannot inherit the kingdom of God, the same apostle 
has everywhere adopted the term "flesh and blood" with regard to the Lord Jesus 
Christ, partly indeed to establish His human nature (for He did Himself speak of 
Himself as the Son of man), and partly that He might confirm the salvation of 
our flesh. For if the flesh were not in a position to be saved, the Word of God 
would in no wise have become flesh. And if the blood of the righteous were not 
to be inquired after, the Lord would certainly not have had blood [in His 
composition]. But inasmuch as blood cries out (vocalis est) from the 
beginning [of the world], God said to Cain, when he had slain his brother, "The 
voice of thy brother's blood crieth to Me." 
And as their blood will be inquired after, He said to those with Noah, "For your 
blood of your souls will I require, [even] from the hand of all beasts; " 
and again, "Whosoever will shed man's blood, 
it shall be shed for his blood." In like manner, too, did the Lord say to those 
who should afterwards shed His blood, "All righteous blood shall be required 
which is shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of 
Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. 
Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation." 
He thus points out the recapitulation that should take place in his own person 
of the effusion of blood from the beginning, of all the righteous men and of the 
prophets, and that by means of Himself there should be a requisition of their 
blood. Now this [blood] could not be required unless it also had the capability 
of being saved; nor would the Lord have summed up these things in Himself, 
unless He had Himself been made flesh and blood after the way of the original 
formation [of man], saving in his own person at the end that which had in the 
beginning perished in Adam.
2. But if the Lord became incarnate for any other order of things, and took 
flesh of any other substance, He has not then summed up human nature in His own 
person, nor in that case can He be termed flesh. For flesh has been truly made 
[to consist in] a transmission of that thing moulded originally from the dust. 
But if it had been necessary for Him to draw the material [of His body] from 
another substance, the Father would at the beginning have moulded the material 
[of flesh] from a different substance [than from what He actually did]. But now 
the case stands thus, that the Word has saved that which really was [created, 
viz., ] humanity which had perished, effecting by means of Himself that 
communion which should be held with it, and seeking out its salvation. But the 
thing which had perished possessed flesh and blood. For the Lord, taking dust 
from the earth, moulded man; and it was upon his behalf that all the 
dispensation of the Lord's advent took place. He had Himself, therefore, flesh 
and blood, recapitulating in Himself not a certain other, but that original 
handiwork of the Father, seeking out that thing which had perished. And for this 
cause the apostle, in the Epistle to the Colossians, says, "And though ye were 
formerly alienated, and enemies to His knowledge by evil works, yet now ye have 
been reconciled in the body of His flesh, through His death, to present 
yourselves holy and chaste, and without fault in His sight." 
He says, "Ye have been reconciled in the body of His flesh," because the 
righteous flesh has reconciled that flesh which was being kept under bondage in 
sin, and brought it into friendship with God.
3. If, then, any one allege that in this respect the flesh of the Lord was 
different from ours, because it indeed did not commit sin, neither was deceit 
found in His soul, while we, on the other hand, are sinners, he says what is the 
fact. But if he pretends that the, Lord possessed another substance of flesh, 
the sayings respecting reconciliation will not agree with that man. For that 
thing is reconciled which had formerly been in enmity. Now, if the Lord had 
taken flesh from another substance, He would not, by so doing, have reconciled 
that one to God which had become inimical through transgression. But now, by 
means of communion with Himself, the Lord has reconciled man to God the Father, 
in reconciling us to Himself by the body of His own flesh, and redeeming us by 
His own blood, as the apostle says to the Ephesians, "In whom we have redemption 
through His blood, the remission of sins; " 
and again to the same he says, "Ye who formerly were far off have been brought 
near in the blood of Christ; " 
and again, "Abolishing in His flesh the enmities, [even] the law of commandments 
[contained] in ordinances." 
And in every Epistle the apostle plainly testifies, that through the flesh of 
our Lord, and through His blood, we have been saved.
4. If, therefore, flesh and blood are the things which procure for us life, 
it has not been declared of flesh and blood, in the literal meaning 
(proprie) of the terms, that they cannot inherit the kingdom of God; but 
[these words apply] to those carnal deeds already mentioned, which, perverting 
man to sin, deprive him of life. And for this reason he says, in the Epistle to 
the Romans: "Let not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal body, to be under its 
control: neither yield ye your members instruments of unrighteousness unto sin; 
but yield yourselves to God, as being alive from the dead, and your members as 
instruments of righteousness unto God." 
In these same members, therefore, in which we used to serve sin, and bring forth 
fruit unto death, does He wish us to [be obedient] unto righteousness, that we 
may bring forth fruit unto life. Remember, therefore, my beloved friend, that 
thou hast been redeemed by the flesh of our Lord, re-established 
by His blood; and "holding the Head, from which the whole body of the Church, 
having been fitted together, takes increase" 
-that is, acknowledging the advent in the flesh of the Son of God, and [His] 
divinity (deum), and looking forward with constancy to His human 
nature 
(hominem), availing thyself also of these proofs drawn from 
Scripture-thou dost easily overthrow, as I have pointed out, all those notions 
of the heretics which were concocted afterwards.

Chapter XV.-Proofs of the 
  Resurrection from Isaiah and Ezekiel; The Same God Who Created Us Will Also 
  Raise Us Up.
1. Now, that He who at the beginning created man, did promise him a second 
birth after his dissolution into earth, Esaias thus declares: "The dead shall 
rise again, and they who are in the tombs shall arise, and they who are in the 
earth shall rejoice. For the dew which is from Thee is health to them." 
And again: "I will comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem: and ye 
shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish as the 
grass; and the hand of the Lord shall be known to those who worship Him." 
And Ezekiel speaks as follows: "And the hand of the Lord came upon me, and the 
Lord led me forth in the Spirit, and set me down in the midst of the plain, and 
this place was full of bones. And He caused me to pass by them round about: and, 
behold, there were many upon the surface of the plain very dry. And He said unto 
me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I said, Lord, Thou who hast made them 
dost know. And He said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and thou shalt say to 
them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord to these 
bones, Behold, I will cause the spirit of life to come upon you, and I will lay 
sinews upon you, and bring up flesh again upon you, and I will stretch skin upon 
you, and will put my Spirit into you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that 
I am the Lord. And I prophesied as the Lord had commanded me. And it came to 
pass, when I was prophesying, that, behold, an earthquake, and the bones were 
drawn together, each one to its own articulation: and I beheld, and, lo, the 
sinews and flesh were produced upon them, and the skins rose upon them round 
about, but there was no breath in them. And He said unto me, Prophesy to the 
breath, son of man, and say to the breath, These things saith the Lord, Come 
from the four winds (spiritibus), and breathe upon these dead, that they 
may live. So I prophesied as the Lord had commanded me, and the breath entered 
into them; and they did live, and stood upon their feet, an exceeding great 
gathering." 
And again he says, "Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will set your graves open, 
and cause you to come out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel; 
and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall open your sepulchres, that I 
may bring my people again out of the sepulchres: and I will put my Spirit into 
you, and ye shall live; and I will place you in your land, and ye shall know 
that I am the Lord.I have said, and I will do, saith the Lord." 
As we at once perceive that the Creator (Demiurgo) is in this passage 
represented as vivifying our dead bodies, and promising resurrection to them, 
and resuscitation from their sepulchres and tombs, conferring upon them 
immortality also (He says, "For as the tree of life, so shall their days 
be" 
), He is shown to be the only God who accomplishes these things, and as Himself 
the good Father, benevolently conferring life upon those who have not life from 
themselves.
2. And for this reason did the Lord most plainly manifest Himself and the 
Father to His disciples, lest, forsooth, they might seek after another God 
besides Him who formed man, and who gave him the breath of life; and that men 
might not rise to such a pitch of madness as to feign another Father above the 
Creator. And thus also He healed by a word all the others who were in a weakly 
condition because of sin; to whom also He said, "Behold, thou art made whole, 
sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon thee: " 
pointing out by this, that, because of the sin of disobedience, infirmities have 
come upon men. To that man, however, who had been blind from his birth, He gave 
sight, not by means of a word, but by an outward action; doing this not without 
a purpose, or because it so happened, but that He might show forth the hand of 
God, that which at the beginning had moulded man. And therefore, when His 
disciples asked Him for what cause the man had been born blind, whether for his 
own or his parents' fault, He replied, "Neither hath this man sinned, nor his 
parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him." 
Now the work of God is the fashioning of man. For, as the Scripture says, He 
made [man] by a kind of process: "And the Lord took day from the earth, and 
formed man." 
Wherefore also the Lord spat on the ground and made clay, and smeared it upon 
the eyes, pointing out the original fashioning [of man], how it was effected, 
and manifesting the hand of God to those who can understand by what [hand] man 
was formed out of the dust. For that which the artificer, the Word, had omitted 
to form in the womb, [viz., the blind man's eyes], He then supplied in public, 
that the works of God might be manifested in him, in order that we might not be 
seeking out another hand by which man was fashioned, nor another Father; knowing 
that this hand of God which formed us at the beginning, and which does form us 
in the womb, has in the last times sought us out who were lost, winning back His 
own, and taking up the lost sheep upon His shoulders, and with joy restoring it 
to the fold of life.
3. Now, that the Word of God forms us in the womb, He says to Jeremiah, 
"Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee; and before thou wentest forth 
from the belly, I sanctified thee, and appointed thee a prophet among the 
nations." 
And Paul, too, says in like manner, "But when it pleased God, who separated me 
from my mother's womb, that I might declare Him among the nations." 
As, therefore, we are by the Word formed in the womb, this very same Word formed 
the visual power in him who had been blind from his birth; showing openly who it 
is that fashions us in secret, since the Word Himself had been made manifest to 
men: and declaring the original formation of Adam, and the manner in which he 
was created, and by what hand he was fashioned, indicating the whole from a 
part. For the Lord who formed the visual powers is He who made the whole man, 
carrying out the will of the Father. And inasmuch as man, with respect to that 
formation which, was after Adam, having fallen into transgression, needed the 
layer of regeneration, [the Lord] said to him [upon whom He had conferred 
sight], after He had smeared his eyes with the clay, "Go to Siloam, and wash; 
" 
thus restoring to him both [his perfect] confirmation, and that regeneration 
which takes place by means of the layer. And for this reason when he was washed 
he came seeing, that he might both know Him who had fashioned him, and that man 
might learn [to know] Him who has conferred upon him life.
4. All the followers of Valentinus, therefore, lose their case, when they say 
that man was not fashioned out of this earth, but from a fluid and diffused 
substance. For, from the earth out of which the Lord formed eyes for that man, 
from the same earth it is evident that man was also fashioned at the beginning. 
For it were incompatible that the eyes should indeed be formed from one source 
and the rest of the body from another; as neither would it be compatible that 
one [being] fashioned the body, and another the eyes. But He, the very same who 
formed Adam at the beginning, with whom also the Father spake, [saying], "Let Us 
make man after Our image and likeness," 
revealing Himself in these last times to men, formed visual organs 
(visionem) for him who had been blind [in that body which he had derived] 
from Adam. Wherefore also the Scripture, pointing out what should come to pass, 
says, that when Adam had hid himself because of his disobedience, the Lord came 
to him at eventide, called him forth, and said, "Where art thou? " 
That means that in the last times the very same Word of God came to call man, 
reminding him of his doings, living in which he had been hidden from the Lord. 
For just as at that time God spake to Adam at eventide, searching him out; so in 
the last times, by means of the same voice, searching out his posterity, He has 
visited them.

Chapter XVI.-Since Our Bodies Return 
  to the Earth, It Follows that They Have Their Substance from It; Also, by the 
  Advent of the Word, the Image of God in Us Appeared in a Clearer 
  Light.
1. And since Adam was moulded from this earth to which we belong, the 
Scripture tells us that God said to him, "In the sweat of thy face shall thou 
eat thy bread, until thou turnest again to the dust from whence thou weft 
taken." 
If then, after death, our bodies return to any other substance, it follows that 
from it also they have their substance. But if it be into this very [earth], it 
is manifest that it was also from it that man's frame was created; as also the 
Lord clearly showed, when from this very substance He formed eyes for the man 
[to whom He gave sight]. And thus was the hand of God plainly shown forth, by 
which Adam was fashioned, and we too have been formed; and since there is one 
and the same Father, whose voice from the beginning even to the end is present 
with His handiwork, and the substance from which we were formed is plainly 
declared through the Gospel, we should therefore not seek after another Father 
besides Him, nor [look for] another substance from which we have been formed, 
besides what was mentioned beforehand, and shown forth by the Lord; nor another 
hand of God besides that which, from the beginning even to the end, forms us and 
prepares us for life, and is present with His handiwork, and perfects it after 
the image and likeness of God.
2. And then, again, this Word was manifested when the Word of God was made 
man, assimilating Himself to man, and man to Himself, so that by means of his 
resemblance to the Son, man might become precious to the Father. For in times 
long past, it was said that man was created after the image of God, but 
it was not [actually] shown; for the Word was as yet invisible, after 
whose image man was created, Wherefore also he did easily lose the similitude. 
When, however, the Word of God became flesh, He confirmed both these: for He 
both showed forth the image truly, since He became Himself what was His image; 
and He re-established the similitude after a sure manner, by assimilating man to 
the invisible Father through means of the visible Word.
3. And not by the aforesaid things alone has the Lord manifested Himself, but 
[He has done this] also by means of His passion. For doing away with [the 
effects of] that disobedience of man which had taken place at the beginning by 
the occasion of a tree, "He became obedient unto death, even the death of the 
cross; " 
rectifying that disobedience which had occurred by reason of a tree, through 
that obedience which was [wrought out] upon the tree [of the cross]. Now He 
would not have come to do away, by means of that same [image], the disobedience 
which had been incurred towards our Maker if He proclaimed another Father. But 
inasmuch as it was by these things that we disobeyed God, and did not give 
credit to His word, so was it also by these same that He brought in obedience 
and consent as respects His Word; by which things He clearly shows forth God 
Himself, whom indeed we had offended in the first Adam, when he did not perform 
His commandment. In the second Adam, however, we are reconciled, being made 
obedient even unto death. For we were debtors to none other but to Him whose 
commandment we had transgressed at the beginning.

Chapter XVII.-There is But One Lord 
  and One God, the Father and Creator of All Things, Who Has Loved Us in Christ, 
  Given Us Commandments, and Remitted Our Sins; Whose Son and Word Christ Proved 
  Himself to Be, When He Forgave Our Sins.
1. Now this being is the Creator (Demiurgus), who is, in respect of 
His love, the Father; but in respect of His power, He is Lord; and in respect of 
His wisdom, our Maker and Fashioner; by transgressing whose commandment we 
became His enemies. And therefore in the last times the Lord has restored us 
into friendship through His incarnation, having become "the Mediator between God 
and men; " 
propitiating indeed for us the Father against whom we had sinned, and cancelling 
(consolatus) our disobedience by His own obedience; conferring also upon 
us the gift of communion with, and subjection to, our Maker. For this reason 
also He has taught us to say in prayer, "And forgive us our debts; " 
since indeed He is our Father, whose debtors we were, having transgressed His 
commandments. But who is this Being? Is He some unknown one, and a Father who 
gives no commandment to any one? Or is He the God who is proclaimed in the 
Scriptures, to whom we were debtors, having transgressed His commandment? Now 
the commandment was given to man by the Word. For Adam, it is said, "heard the 
voice of the Lord God." 
Rightly then does His Word say to man, "Thy sins are forgiven thee; " 
He, the same against whom we had sinned in the beginning, grants forgiveness of 
sins in the end. But if indeed we had disobeyed the command of any other, while 
it was a different being who said, "Thy sins are forgiven thee; " 
such an one is neither good, nor true, nor just. For how can he be good, who 
does not give from what belongs to himself? Or how can he be just, who snatches 
away the goods of another? And in what way can sins be truly remitted, unless 
that He against whom we have sinned has Himself granted remission "through the 
bowels of mercy of our God," in which "He has visited us" 
through His Son?
2. And therefore, when He had healed the man sick of the palsy, [the 
evangelist] says "The people upon seeing it glorified God, who gave such power 
unto men." 
What God, then, did the bystanders glorify? Was it indeed that unknown Father 
invented by the heretics? And how could they glorify him who was altogether 
unknown to them? It is evident, therefore, that the Israelites glorified Him who 
has been proclaimed as God by the law and the prophets, who is also the Father 
of our Lord; and therefore He taught men, by the evidence of their senses 
through those signs which He accomplished, to give glory to God. If, however, He 
Himself had come from another Father, and men glorified a different Father when 
they beheld His miracles, He [in that case] rendered them ungrateful to that 
Father who had sent the gift of healing. But as the only-begotten Son had come 
for man's salvation from Him who is God, He did both stir up the incredulous by 
the miracles which He was in the habit of working, to give glory to the Father; 
and to the Pharisees, who did not admit the advent of His Son, and who 
consequently did not believe in the remission [of sins] which was conferred by 
Him, He said, "That ye may know that the Son of man hath power to forgive 
sins." 
And when He had said this, He commanded the paralytic man to take up the pallet 
upon which he was lying, and go into his house. By this work of His He 
confounded the unbelievers, and showed that He is Himself the voice of God, by 
which man received commandments, which he broke, and became a sinner; for the 
paralysis followed as a consequence of sins.
3. Therefore, by remitting sins, He did indeed heal man, while He also 
manifested Himself who He was. For if no one can forgive sins but God alone, 
while the Lord remitted them and healed men, it is plain that He was Himself the 
Word of God made the Son of man, receiving from the Father the power of 
remission of sins; since He was man, and since He was God, in order that since 
as man He suffered for us, so as God He might have compassion on us, and forgive 
us our debts, in which we were made debtors to God our Creator. And therefore 
David said beforehand, "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and 
whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord has not imputed sin; 
" 
pointing out thus that remission of sins which follows upon His advent, by which 
"He has destroyed the handwriting" of our debt, and "fastened it to the cross; 
" 
so that as by means of a tree we were made debtors to God, [so also] by means of 
a tree we may obtain the remission of our debt.
4. This fact has been strikingly set forth by many others, and especially 
through means of Elisha the prophet. For when his fellow-prophets were hewing 
wood for the construction of a tabernacle, and when the iron [head], shaken 
loose from the axe, had fallen into the Jordan and could not be found by them, 
upon Elisha's coming to the place, and learning what had happened, he threw some 
wood into the water. Then, when he had done this, the iron part of the axe 
floated up, and they took up from the surface of the water what they had 
previously lost. 
By this action the prophet pointed out that the sure word of God, which we had 
negligently lost by means of a tree, and were not in the way of finding again, 
we should receive anew by the dispensation of a tree, [viz., the cross of 
Christ]. For that the word of God is likened to an axe, John the Baptist 
declares [when he says] in reference to it, "But now also is the axe laid to the 
root of the trees." 
Jeremiah also says to the same purport: "The word of God cleaveth the rock as an 
axe." 
This word, then, what was hidden from us, did the dispensation of the tree make 
manifest, as I have already remarked. For as we lost it by means of a tree, by 
means of a tree again was it made manifest to all, showing the height, the 
length, the breadth, the depth in itself; and, as a certain man among our 
predecessors observed, "Through the extension of the hands of a divine 
person, 
gathering together the two peoples to one God." For these were two hands, 
because there were two peoples scattered to the ends of the earth; but there was 
one head in the middle, as there is but one God, who is above all, and through 
all, and in us all.

Chapter XVIII.-God the Father and 
  His Word Have Formed All Created Things (Which They Use) by Their Own Power 
  and Wisdom, Not Out of Defect or Ignorance. The Son of God, Who Received All 
  Power from the Father, Would Otherwise Never Have Taken Flesh Upon 
  Him.
1. And such or so important a dispensation He did not bring about by means of 
the creations of others, but by His own; neither by those things which were 
created out of ignorance and defect, but by those which had their substance from 
the wisdom and power of His Father. For He was neither unrighteous, so that He 
should covet the property of another; nor needy, that He could not by His own 
means impart life to His own, and make use of His own creation for the salvation 
of man. For indeed the creation could not have sustained Him [on the cross], if 
He had sent forth [simply by commission] what was the fruit of ignorance and 
defect. Now we have repeatedly shown that the incarnate Word of God was 
suspended upon a tree, and even the very heretics do acknowledge that He was 
crucified. How, then, could the fruit of ignorance and defect sustain Him who 
contains the knowledge of all things, and is true and perfect? Or how could that 
creation which was concealed from the Father, and far removed from Him, have 
sustained His Word? And if this world were made by the angels (it matters not 
whether we suppose their ignorance or their cognizance of the Supreme God), when 
the Lord declared, "For I am in the Father, and the Father in Me," 
how could this workmanship of the angels have borne to be burdened at once with 
the Father and the Son? How, again, could that creation which is beyond the 
Pleroma have contained Him who contains the entire Pleroma? Inasmuch, then, as 
all these things are impossible and incapable of proof, that preaching of the 
Church is alone true [which proclaims] that His own creation bare Him, which 
subsists by the power, the skill, and the wisdom of God; which is sustained, 
indeed, after an invisible manner by the Father, but, on the contrary, after a 
visible manner it bore His Word: and this is the true [Word].
2. For the Father bears the creation and His own Word simultaneously, and the 
Word borne by the Father grants the Spirit to all as the Father wills. 
To some He gives after the manner of creation what is made; 
but to others [He gives] after the manner of adoption, that is, what is from 
God, namely generation. And thus one God the Father is declared, who is above 
all, and through all, and in all. The Father is indeed above all, and He is the 
Head of Christ; but the Word is through all things, and is Himself the Head of 
the Church; while the Spirit is in us all, and He is the living water, 
which the Lord grants to those who rightly believe in Him, and love Him, and who 
know that "there is one Father, who is above all, and through all, and in us 
all." 
And to these things does John also, the disciple of the Lord, bear witness, when 
he speaks thus in the Gospel: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was 
with God, and the Word was God. This was in the beginning with God. All things 
were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made." 
And then he said of the Word Himself: "He was in the world, and the world was 
made by Him, and the world knew Him not. To His own things He came, and His own 
people received Him not. However, as many as did receive Him, to these gave He 
power to become the sons of God, to those that believe in His name." 
And again, showing the dispensation with regard to His human nature, John said: 
"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." 
And in continuation he says, "And we beheld His glory, the glory as of the 
Only-begotten by the Father, full of grace and truth." He thus plainly points 
out to those willing to hear, that is, to those having ears, that there is one 
God, the Father over all, and one Word of God, who is through all, by whom all 
things have been made; and that this world belongs to Him, and was made by Him, 
according to the Father's will, and not by angels; nor by apostasy, defect, and 
ignorance; nor by any power of Prunicus, whom certain of them also call "the 
Mother; "nor by any other maker of the world ignorant of the Father.
3. For the Creator of the world is truly the Word of God: and this is our 
Lord, who in the last times was made man, existing in this world, and who in an 
invisible manner contains all things created, and is inherent in the entire 
creation, since the Word of God governs and arranges all things; and therefore 
He came to His own in a visible 
manner, and was made flesh, and hung upon the tree, that He might sum up all 
things in Himself. "And His own peculiar people did not receive Him," as Moses 
declared this very thing among the people: "And thy life shall be hanging before 
thine eyes, and thou wilt not believe thy life." 
Those therefore who did not receive Him did not receive life. "But to as many as 
received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God." 
For it is He who has power from the Father over all things, since He is the Word 
of God, and very man, communicating with invisible beings after the manner of 
the intellect, and appointing a law observable to the outward senses, that all 
things should continue each in its own order; and He reigns manifestly over 
things visible and pertaining to men; and brings in just judgment and worthy 
upon all; as David also, clearly pointing to this, says, "Our God shall openly 
come, and will not keep silence." 
Then he shows also the judgment which is brought in by Him, saying, "A fire 
shall burn in His sight, and a strong tempest shall rage round about Him. He 
shall call upon the heaven from above, and the earth, to judge His people."

Chapter XIX.-A Comparison is 
  Instituted Between the Disobedient and Sinning Eve and the Virgin Mary, Her 
  Patroness. Various and Discordant Heresies are Mentioned.
1. That the Lord then was manifestly coming to His own things, and was 
sustaining them by means of that creation which is supported by Himself, and was 
making a recapitulation of that disobedience which had occurred in connection 
with a tree, through the obedience which was [exhibited by Himself when He hung] 
upon a tree, [the effects] also of that deception being done away with, by which 
that virgin Eve, who was already espoused to a man, was unhappily misled,-was 
happily announced, through means of the truth [spoken] by the angel to the 
Virgin Mary, who was [also espoused] to a man. 
For just as the former was led astray by the word of an angel, so that she fled 
from God when she had transgressed His word; so did the latter, by an angelic 
communication, receive the glad tidings that she should sustain 
(portaret) God, being obedient to His word. And if the former did disobey 
God, yet the latter was persuaded to be obedient to God, in order that the 
Virgin Mary might become the patroness 
(advocata) of the virgin Eve. And thus, as the human race fell into 
bondage to death by means of a virgin, so is it rescued by a virgin; virginal 
disobedience having been balanced in the opposite scale by virginal obedience. 
For in the same way the sin of the first created man (protoplasti) 
receives amendment by the correction of the First-begotten, and the coming of 
the serpent is conquered by the harmlessness of the dove, those bonds being 
unloosed by which we had been fast bound to death.
2. The heretics being all unlearned and ignorant of God's arrangements, and 
not acquainted with that dispensation by which He took upon Him human nature 
(inscii ejus quae est secundum hominem dispensationis), inasmuch as they 
blind themselves with regard to the truth, do in fact speak against their own 
salvation. Some of them introduce another Father besides the Creator; some, 
again, say that the world and its substance was made by certain angels; certain 
others [maintain] that it was widely separated by Horos 
from him whom they represent as being the Father-that it sprang forth 
(floruisse) of itself, and from itself was born. Then, again, others [of 
them assert] that it obtained substance in those things which are contained by 
the Father, from defect and ignorance; others still, despise the advent of the 
Lord manifest [to the senses], for they do not admit His incarnation; while 
others, ignoring the arrangement [that He should be born] of a virgin, main-rain 
that He was begotten by Joseph. And still further, some affirm that neither 
their soul nor their body can receive eternal life, but merely the inner man. 
Moreover, they will have it that this [inner man] is that which is the 
understanding (sensum) in them, and which they decree as being the only 
thing to ascend to "the perfect." Others [maintain], as I have said in the first 
book, that while the soul is saved, their body does not participate in the 
salvation which comes from God; in which [book] I have also set forward the 
hypotheses of all these men, and in the second have pointed out their weakness 
and inconsistency.

Chapter XX.-Those Pastors are to Be 
  Heard to Whom the Apostles Committed the Churches, Possessing One and the Same 
  Doctrine of Salvation; The Heretics, on the Other Hand, are to Be Avoided. We 
  Must Think Soberly with Regard to the Mysteries of the Faith.
1. Now all these [heretics] are of much later date than the bishops to whom 
the apostles committed the Churches; which fact I have in the third book taken 
all pains to demonstrate. It follows, then, as a matter of course, that these 
heretics aforementioned, since they are blind to the truth, and deviate from the 
[right] way, will walk in various roads; and therefore the footsteps of their 
doctrine are scattered here and there without agreement or connection. But the 
path of those belonging to the Church circumscribes the whole world, as 
possessing the sure tradition from the apostles, and gives unto us to see that 
the faith of all is one and the same, since all receive one and the same God the 
Father, and believe in the same dispensation regarding the incarnation of the 
Son of God, and are cognizant of the same gift of the Spirit, and are conversant 
with the same commandments, and preserve the same form of ecclesiastical 
constitution, 
and expect the same advent of the Lord, and await the same salvation of the 
complete man, that is, of the soul and body. And undoubtedly the preaching of 
the Church is true and stedfast, 
in which one and the same way of salvation is shown throughout the whole world. 
For to her is entrusted the light of God; and therefore the "wisdom" of God, by 
means of which she saves all men, "is declared in [its] going forth; it uttereth 
[its voice] faithfully in the streets, is preached on the tops of the walls, and 
speaks continually in the gates of the city." 
For the Church preaches the truth everywhere, and she is the seven-branched 
candlestick which bears the light of Christ.
2. Those, therefore, who desert the preaching of the Church, call in question 
the knowledge of the holy presbyters, not taking into consideration of how much 
greater consequence is a religious man, even in a private station, than a 
blasphemous and impudent sophist. 
Now, such are all the heretics, and those who imagine that they have hit upon 
something more beyond the truth, so that by following those things already 
mentioned, proceeding on their way variously, in harmoniously, and foolishly, 
not keeping always to the same opinions with regard to the same things, as blind 
men are led by the blind, they shall deservedly fall into the ditch of ignorance 
lying in their path, ever seeking and never finding out the truth. 
It behoves us, therefore, to avoid their doctrines, and to take careful heed 
lest we suffer any injury from them; but to flee to the Church, and be brought 
up in her bosom, and be nourished with the Lord's Scriptures. For the Church has 
been planted as a garden (paradisus) in this world; therefore says the 
Spirit of God, "Thou mayest freely eat from every tree of the garden," 
that is, Eat ye from every Scripture of the Lord; but ye shall not eat with an 
uplifted mind, nor touch any heretical discord. For these men do profess that 
they have themselves the knowledge of good and evil; and they set their own 
impious minds above the God who made them. They therefore form opinions on what 
is beyond the limits of the understanding. For this cause also the apostle says, 
"Be not wise beyond what it is fitting to be wise, but be wise 
prudently," 
that we be not east forth by eating of the "knowledge" of these men (that 
knowledge which knows more than it should do) from the paradise of life. Into 
this paradise the Lord has introduced those who obey His call, "summing up in 
Himself all things which are in heaven, and which are on earth; " 
but the things in heaven are spiritual, while those on earth constitute the 
dispensation in human nature (secundum hominem est dispositio). These 
things, therefore, He recapitulated in Himself: by uniting man to the Spirit, 
and causing the Spirit to dwell in man, He is Himself made the head of the 
Spirit, and gives the Spirit to be the head of man: for through Him (the Spirit) 
we see, and hear, and speak.

Chapter XXI.-Christ is the Head of 
  All Things Already Mentioned. It Was Fitting that He Should Be Sent by the 
  Father, the Creator of All Things, to Assume Human Nature, and Should Be 
  Tempted by Satan, that He Might Fulfil the Promises, and Carry Off a Glorious 
  and Perfect Victory.
1. He has therefore, in His work of recapitulation, summed up all things, 
both waging war against our enemy, and crushing him who had at the beginning led 
us away captives in Adam, and trampled upon his head, as thou canst perceive in 
Genesis that God said to the serpent, "And I will put enmity between thee and 
the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; He shall be on the watch for 
(observabit 
) thy head, and thou on the watch for His heel." 
For from that time, He who should be born of a woman, [namely] from the Virgin, 
after the likeness of Adam, was preached as keeping watch for the head of the 
serpent. This is the seed of which the apostle says in the Epistle to the 
Galatians, "that the law of works was established until the seed should come to 
whom the promise was made." 
This fact is exhibited in a still clearer light in the same Epistle, where he 
thus speaks: "But when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth His Son, 
made of a woman." 
For indeed the enemy would not have been fairly vanquished, unless it had been a 
man [born] of a woman who conquered him. For it was by means of a woman that he 
got the advantage over man at first, setting himself up as man's opponent. And 
therefore does the Lord profess Himself to be the Son of man, comprising in 
Himself that original man out of whom the woman was fashioned (ex quo ea quae 
secundum mulierem est plasmatio facta est), in order that, as our species 
went down to death through a vanquished man, so we may ascend to life again 
through a victorious one; and as through a man death received the palm [of 
victory] against us, so again by a man we may receive the palm against 
death.
2. Now the Lord would not have recapitulated in Himself that ancient and 
primary enmity against the serpent, fulfilling the promise of the Creator 
(Demiurgi), and performing His command, if He had come from another 
Father. But as He is one and the same, who formed us at the beginning, and sent 
His Son at the end, the Lord did perform His command, being made of a woman, by 
both destroying our adversary, and perfecting man after the image and likeness 
of God. And for this reason He did not draw the means of confounding him from 
any other source than from the words of the law, and made use of the Father's 
commandment as a help towards the destruction and confusion of the apostate 
angel. Fasting forty days, like Moses and Elias, He afterwards hungered, first, 
in order that we may perceive that He was a real and substantial man-for it 
belongs to a man to suffer hunger when fasting; and secondly, that His opponent 
might have an opportunity of attacking Him. For as at the beginning it was by 
means of food that [the enemy] persuaded man, although not suffering hunger, to 
transgress God's commandments, so in the end he did not succeed in persuading 
Him that was an hungered to take that food which proceeded from God. For, when 
tempting Him, he said, "If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be 
made bread." 
But the Lord repulsed him by the commandment of the law, saying, "It is written, 
Man doth not live by bread alone." 
As to those words `[of His enemy, ] "If thou be the Son of God," [the Lord] made 
no remark; but by thus acknowledging His human nature He baffled His adversary, 
and exhausted the force of his first attack by means of His Father's word. The 
corruption of man, therefore, which occurred in paradise by both [of our first 
parents] eating, was done away with by [the Lord's] want of food in this 
world. 
But he, being thus vanquished by the law, endeavoured again to make an assault 
by himself quoting a commandment of the law. For, bringing Him to the highest 
pinnacle of the temple, he said to Him, "If thou art the Son of God, cast 
thyself down. For it is written, That God shall give His angels charge 
concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest perchance thou 
dash thy foot against a stone; " 
thus concealing a falsehood under the guise of Scripture, as is done by all the 
heretics. For that was indeed written, [namely], "That He hath given His angels 
charge concerning Him; "but "east thyself down from hence" no Scripture said in 
reference to Him: this kind of persuasion the devil produced from himself. The 
Lord therefore confuted him out of the law, when He said, "It is written again, 
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God; " 
pointing out by the word contained in the law that which is the duty of man, 
that he should not tempt God; and in regard to Himself, since He appeared in 
human form, [declaring] that He would not tempt the Lord his God. 
The pride of reason, therefore, which was in the serpent, was put to nought by 
the humility found in the man [Christ], and now twice was the devil conquered 
from Scripture, when he was detected as advising things contrary to God's 
commandment, and was shown to be the enemy of God by [the expression of] his 
thoughts. He then, having been thus signally defeated, and then, as it were, 
concentrating his forces, drawing up in order all his available power for 
falsehood, in the third place "showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the 
glory of them," 
saying, as Luke relates, "All these will I give thee,-for they are delivered to 
me; and to whom I will, I give them,-if thou wilt fall down and worship me." The 
Lord then, exposing him in his true character, says, "Depart, Satan; for it is 
written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou 
serve." 
He both revealed him by this name, and showed [at the same time] who He Himself 
was. For the Hebrew word "Satan" signifies an apostate. And thus, vanquishing 
him for the third time, He spurned him from Him finally as being conquered out 
of the law; and there was done away with that infringement of God's commandment 
which had occurred in Adam, by means of the precept of the law, which the Son of 
man observed, who did not transgress the commandment of God.
3. Who, then, is this Lord God to whom Christ bears witness, whom no man 
shall tempt, whom all should worship, and serve Him alone? It is, beyond all 
manner of doubt, that God who also gave the law. For these things had been 
predicted in the law, and by the words (sententiam) of the law the Lord 
showed that the law does indeed declare the Word of God from the Father; and the 
apostate angel of God is destroyed by its voice, being exposed in his true 
colours, and vanquished by the Son of man keeping the commandment of God. For as 
in the beginning he enticed man to transgress his Maker's law, and thereby got 
him into his power; yet his power consists in transgression and apostasy, and 
with these he bound man [to himself]; so again, on the other hand, it was 
necessary that through man himself he should, when conquered, be bound with the 
same chains with which he had bound man, in order that man, being set free, 
might return to his Lord, leaving to him (Satan) those bonds by which he himself 
had been fettered, that is, sin. For when Satan is bound, man is set free; since 
"none can enter a strong man's house and spoil his goods, unless he first bind 
the strong man himself." 
The Lord therefore exposes him as speaking contrary to the word of that God who 
made all things, and subdues him by means of the commandment. Now the law is the 
commandment of God. The Man proves him to be a fugitive from and a transgressor 
of the law, an apostate also from God. After [the Man had done this], the Word 
bound him securely as a fugitive from Himself, and made spoil of his 
goods,-namely, those men whom he held in bondage, and whom he unjustly used for 
his own purposes. And justly indeed is he led captive, who had led men unjustly 
into bondage; while man, who had been led captive in times past, was rescued 
from the grasp of his possessor, according to the tender mercy of God the 
Father, who had compassion on His own handiwork, and gave to it salvation, 
restoring it by means of the Word-that is, by Christ-in order that men might 
learn by actual proof that he receives incorruptibility not of himself, but by 
the free gift of God.

Chapter XXII.-The True Lord and the 
  One God is Declared by the Law, and Manifested by Christ His Son in the 
  Gospel; Whom Alone We Should Adore, and from Him We Must Look for All Good 
  Things, Not from Satan.
1. Thus then does the Lord plainly show that it was the true Lord and the one 
God who had been set forth by the law; for Him whom the law proclaimed as God, 
the same did Christ point out as the Father, whom also it behoves the disciples 
of Christ alone to serve. By means of the statements of the law, He put our 
adversary to utter confusion; and the law directs us to praise God the Creator 
(Demiurgum), and to serve Him alone. Since this is the case, we must not 
seek for another Father besides Him, or above Him, since there is one God who 
justifies the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through 
faith. 
For if there were any other perfect Father above Him, He (Christ) would by no 
means have overthrown Satan by means of His words and commandments. For one 
ignorance cannot be done away with by means of another ignorance, any more than 
one defect by another defect. If, therefore, the law is due to ignorance and 
defect, how could the statements contained therein bring to nought the ignorance 
of the devil, and conquer the strong man? For a strong man can be conquered 
neither by an inferior nor by an equal, but by one possessed of greater power. 
But the Word of God is the superior above all, He who is loudly proclaimed in 
the law: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God; "and, "Thou shalt love 
the Lord thy God with all thy heart; "and, "Him shall thou adore, and Him alone 
shall thou serve." 
Then in the Gospel, casting down the apostasy by means of these expressions, He 
did both overcome the strong man by His Father's voice, and He acknowledges the 
commandment of the law to express His own sentiments, when He says, "Thou shall 
not tempt the Lord thy God." 
For He did not confound the adversary by the saying of any other, but by that 
belonging to His own Father, and thus overcame the strong man.
2. He taught by His commandment that we who have been set free should, when 
hungry, take that food which is given by God; and that, when placed in the 
exalted position of every grace [that can be received], we should not, either by 
trusting to works of righteousness, or when adorned with super-eminent [gifts 
of] ministration, by any means be lifted up with pride, nor should we tempt God, 
but should feel humility in all things, and have ready to hand [this saying], 
"Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God." 
As also the apostle taught, saying, "Minding not high things, but consenting to 
things of low estate; " 
that we should neither be ensnared with riches, nor mundane glory, nor present 
fancy, but should know that we must "worship the Lord thy God, and serve Him 
alone," and give no heed to him who falsely promised things not his own, when he 
said, "All these will I give thee, if, falling down, thou wilt worship me." For 
he himself confesses that to adore him, and to do his will, is to fall from the 
glory of God. And in what thing either pleasant or good can that man who has 
fallen participate? Or what else can such a person hope for or expect, except 
death? For death is next neighbour to him who has fallen. Hence also it follows 
that he will not give what he has promised. For how can he make grants to him 
who has fallen? Moreover, since God rules over men and him too, and without the 
will of our Father in heaven not even a sparrow falls to the ground, 
it follows that his declaration, "All these things are delivered unto me, and to 
whomsoever I will I give them," proceeds from him when puffed up with pride. For 
the creation is not subjected to his power, since indeed he is himself but one 
among created things. Nor shall he give away the rule over men to men; but both 
all other things, and all human affairs, are arranged according to God the 
Father's disposal. Besides, the Lord declares that "the devil is a liar from the 
beginning, and the truth is not in him." 
If then he be a liar and the truth be not in him, he certainly did not speak 
truth, but a lie, when he said, "For all these things are delivered to me, and 
to whomsoever I will I give them." 


Chapter XXIII.-The Devil is Well 
  Practised in Falsehood, by Which Adam Having Been Led Astray, Sinned on the 
  Sixth Day of the Creation, in Which Day Also He Has Been Renewed by 
  Christ.
1. He had indeed been already accustomed to lie against God, for the purpose 
of leading men astray. For at the beginning, when God had given to man a variety 
of things for food, while He commanded him not to eat of one tree only, as the 
Scripture tells us that God said to Adam: "From every tree which is in the 
garden thou shalt eat food; but from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, 
from this ye shall not eat: for in the day that ye shall eat of it, ye shall die 
by death; " 
he then, lying against the Lord, tempted man, as the Scripture says that the 
serpent said to the woman: "Has God indeed said this, Ye shall not eat from 
every tree of the garden? " 
And when she had exposed the falsehood, and simply related the command, as He 
had said, "From every tree of the garden we shall eat; but of the fruit of the 
tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, 
neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die: " 
when he had [thus] learned from the woman the command of God, having brought his 
cunning into play, he finally deceived her by a falsehood, saying, "Ye shall not 
die by death; for God knew that in the day ye shall eat of it your eyes shall be 
opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." 
In the first place, then, in the garden of God he disputed about God, as if God 
was not there, for he was ignorant of the greatness of God; and then, in the 
next place, after he had learned from the woman that God had said that they 
should die if they tasted the aforesaid tree, opening his mouth, he uttered the 
third falsehood," Ye shall not die by death." But that God was true, and the 
serpent a liar, was proved by the result, death having passed upon them who had 
eaten. For along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death, 
because they did eat in disobedience; and disobedience to God entails death. 
Wherefore, as they became forfeit to death, from that [moment] they were handed 
over to it.
2. Thus, then, in the day that they did eat, in the same did they die, and 
became death's debtors, since it was one day of the creation. For it is said, 
"There was made in the evening, and there was made in the morning, one day." Now 
in this same day that they did eat, in that also did they die. But according to 
the cycle and progress of the days, after which one is termed first, another 
second, and another third, if anybody seeks diligently to learn upon what day 
out of the seven it was that Adam died, he will find it by examining the 
dispensation of the Lord. For by summing up in Himself the whole human race from 
the beginning to the end, He has also summed up its death. From this it is clear 
that the Lord suffered death, in obedience to His Father, upon that day on which 
Adam died while he disobeyed God. Now he died on the same day in which he did 
eat. For God said, "In that day on which ye shall eat of it, ye shall die by 
death." The Lord, therefore, recapitulating in Himself this day, underwent His 
sufferings upon the day preceding the Sabbath, that is, the sixth day of the 
creation, on which day man was created; thus granting him a second creation by 
means of His passion, which is that [creation] out of death. And there are some, 
again, who relegate the death of Adam to the thousandth year; for since "a day 
of the Lord is as a thousand years," 
he did not overstep the thousand years, but died within them, thus bearing out 
the sentence of his sin. Whether, therefore, with respect to disobedience, which 
is death; whether [we consider] that, on account of that, they were delivered 
over to death, and made debtors to it; whether with respect to [the fact that 
on] one and the same day on which they ate they also died (for it is one day of 
the creation); whether [we regard this point], that, with respect to this cycle 
of days, they died on the day in which they did also eat, that is, the day] of 
the preparation, which is termed "the pure supper," that is, the sixth day of 
the feast, which the Lord also exhibited when He suffered on that day; or 
whether [we reflect] that he (Adam) did not overstep the thousand years, but 
died within their limit,-it follows that, in regard to all these significations, 
God is indeed true. For they died who tasted of the tree; and the serpent is 
proved a liar and a murderer, as the Lord said of him: "For he is a murderer 
from the beginning, and the truth is not in him." 


Chapter XXIV.-Of the Constant 
  Falsehood of the Devil, and of the Powers and Governments of the World, Which 
  We Ought to Obey, Inasmuch as They are Appointed of God, Not of the 
  Devil.
1. As therefore the devil lied at the beginning, so did he also in the end, 
when he said, "All these are delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give 
them." 
For it is not he who has appointed the kingdoms of this world, but God; for "the 
heart of the king is in the hand of God." 
And the Word also says by Solomon, "By me kings do reign, and princes administer 
justice. By me chiefs are raised up, and by me kings rule the earth." 
Paul the apostle also says upon this same subject: "Be ye subject to all the 
higher powers; for there is no power but of God: now those which are have been 
ordained of God." 
And again, in reference to them he says, "For he beareth not the sword in vain; 
for he is the minister of God, the avenger for wrath to him who does 
evil." 
Now, that he spake these words, not in regard to angelical powers, nor of 
invisible rulers-as some venture to expound the passage-but of those of actual 
human authorities, [he shows when] he says, "For this cause pay ye tribute also: 
for they are God's ministers, doing service for this very thing." 
This also the Lord confirmed, when He did not do what He was tempted to by the 
devil; but He gave directions that tribute should be paid to the tax-gatherers 
for Himself and Peter; 
because "they are the ministers of God, serving for this very thing."
2. For since man, by departing from God, reached such a pitch of fury as even 
to look upon his brother as his enemy, and engaged without fear in every kind of 
restless conduct, and murder, and avarice; God imposed upon mankind the fear of 
man, as they did not acknowledge the fear of God, in order that, being subjected 
to the authority of men, and kept under restraint by their laws, they might 
attain to some degree of justice, and exercise mutual forbearance through dread 
of the sword suspended full in their view, as the apostle says: "For he beareth 
not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of God, the avenger for wrath upon 
him who does evil." And for this reason too, magistrates themselves, having laws 
as a clothing of righteousness whenever they act in a just and legitimate 
manner, shall not be called in question for their conduct, nor be liable to 
punishment. But whatsoever they do to the subversion of justice, iniquitously, 
and impiously, and illegally, and tyrannically, in these things shall they also 
perish; for the just judgment of God comes equally upon all, and in no case is 
defective. Earthly rule, therefore, has been appointed by God for the benefit of 
nations, 
and not by the devil, who is never at rest at all, nay, who does not love to see 
even nations conducting themselves after a quiet manner, so that under the fear 
of human rule, men may not eat each other up like fishes; but that, by means of 
the establishment of laws, they may keep down an excess of wickedness among the 
nations. And considered from this point of view, those who exact tribute from us 
are "God's ministers, serving for this very purpose."
3. As, then, "the powers that be are ordained of God," it is clear that the 
devil lied when he said, "These are delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will, 
I give them." For by the law of the same Being as calls men into existence are 
kings also appointed, adapted for those men who are at the time placed under 
their government. Some of these [rulers] are given for the correction and the 
benefit of their subjects, and for the preservation of justice; but others, for 
the purposes of fear and punishment and rebuke: others, as [the subjects] 
deserve it, are for deception, disgrace, and pride; while the just judgment of 
God, as I have observed already, passes equally upon all. The devil, however, as 
he is the apostate angel, can only go to this length, as he did at the 
beginning, [namely] to deceive and lead astray the mind of man into disobeying 
the commandments of God, and gradually to darken the hearts of those who would 
endeavour to serve him, to the forgetting of the true God, but to the adoration 
of himself as God.
4. Just as if any one, being an apostate, and seizing in a hostile manner 
another man's territory, should harass the inhabitants of it, in order that he 
might claim for himself the glory of a king among those ignorant of his apostasy 
and robbery; so likewise also the devil, being one among those angels who are 
placed over the spirit of the air, as the Apostle Paul has declared in his 
Epistle to the Ephesians, 
becoming envious of man, was rendered an apostate from the divine law: for envy 
is a thing foreign to God. And as his apostasy was exposed by man, and man 
became the [means of] searching out his thoughts (et examinatio sententiae 
ejus, homo factus est), he has set himself to this with greater and greater 
determination, in opposition to man, envying his life, and wishing to involve 
him in his own apostate power. The Word of God, however, the Maker of all 
things, conquering him by means of human nature, and showing him to be an 
apostate, has, on the contrary, put him under the power of man. For He says, 
"Behold, I confer upon you the power of treading upon serpents and scorpions, 
and upon all the power of the enemy," 
in order that, as he obtained dominion over man by apostasy, so again his 
apostasy might be deprived of power by means of man turning back again to 
God.

Chapter XXV.-The Fraud, Pride, and 
  Tyrannical Kingdom of Antichrist, as Described by Daniel and 
Paul.
1. And not only by the particulars already mentioned, but also by means of 
the events which shall occur in the time of Antichrist is it shown that he, 
being an apostate and a robber, is anxious to be adored as God; and that, 
although a mere slave, he wishes himself to be proclaimed as a king. For he 
(Antichrist) being endued with all the power of the devil, shall come, not as a 
righteous king, nor as a legitimate king, [i.e., one] in subjection to God, but 
an impious, unjust, and lawless one; as an apostate, iniquitous and murderous; 
as a robber, concentrating in himself [all] satanic apostasy, and setting aside 
idols to persuade [men] that he himself is God, raising up himself as the only 
idol, having in himself the multifarious errors of the other idols. This he 
does, in order that they who do [now] worship the devil by means of many 
abominations, may serve himself by this one idol, of whom the apostle thus 
speaks in the second Epistle to the Thessalonians: "Unless there shall come a 
failing away first, and the man of sin shall be revealed, the son of perdition, 
who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is 
worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself as if he 
were God." The apostle therefore clearly points out his apostasy, and that he is 
lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worshipped-that is, above 
every idol-for these are indeed so called by men, but are not [really] gods; and 
that he will endeavour in a tyrannical manner to set himself forth as God.
2. Moreover, he (the apostle) has also pointed out this which I have shown in 
many ways, that the temple in Jerusalem was made by the direction of the true 
God. For the apostle himself, speaking in his own person, distinctly called it 
the temple of God. Now I have shown in the third book, that no one is termed God 
by the apostles when speaking for themselves, except Him who truly is God, the 
Father of our Lord, by whose directions the temple which is at Jerusalem was 
constructed for those purposes which I have already mentioned; in which [temple] 
the enemy shall sit, endeavouring to show himself as Christ, as the Lord also 
declares: "But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, which has been 
spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that 
readeth understand), then let those who are in Judea flee into the mountains; 
and he who is upon the house-top, let him not come down to take anything out of 
his house: for there shall then be great hardship, such as has not been from the 
beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be." 

3. Daniel too, looking forward to the end of the last kingdom, i.e., the ten 
last kings, amongst whom the kingdom of those men shall be partitioned, and upon 
whom the son of perdition shall come, declares that ten horns shall spring from 
the beast, and that another little horn shall arise in the midst of them, and 
that three of the former shall be rooted up before his face. He says: "And, 
behold, eyes were in this horn as the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great 
things, and his look was more stout than his fellows. I was looking, and this 
horn made war against the saints, and prevailed against them, until the Ancient 
of days came and gave judgment to the saints of the most high God, and the time 
came, and the saints obtained the kingdom." 
Then, further on, in the interpretation of the vision, there was said to him: 
"The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall excel all 
other kingdoms, and devour the whole earth, and tread it down, and cut it in 
pieces. And its ten horns are ten kings which shall arise; and after them shall 
arise another, who shall surpass in evil deeds all that were before him, and 
shall overthrow three kings; and he shall speak words against the most high God, 
and wear out the saints of the most high God, and shall purpose to change times 
and laws; and [everything] shall be given into his hand until a time of times 
and a half time," 
that is, for three years and six months, during which time, when he comes, he 
shall reign over the earth. Of whom also the Apostle Paul again, speaking in the 
second [Epistle] to the Thessalonians, and at the same time proclaiming the 
cause of his advent, thus says: "And then shall the wicked one be revealed, whom 
the Lord Jesus shall slay with the spirit of His mouth, and destroy by the 
presence of His coming; whose coming [i.e., the wicked one's] is after the 
working of Satan, in all power, and signs, and portents of lies, and with all 
deceivableness of wickedness for those who perish; because they did not receive 
the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And therefore God will send 
them the working of error, that they may believe a lie; that they all may be 
judged who did not believe the truth, but gave consent to iniquity," 

4. The Lord also spoke as follows to those who did not believe in Him: "I 
have come in my Father's name, and ye have not received Me: when another shall 
come in his own name, him ye will receive," 
calling Antichrist "the other," because he is alienated from the Lord. This is 
also the unjust judge, whom the Lord mentioned as one "who feared not God, 
neither regarded man," 
to whom the widow fled in her forgetfulness of God,-that is, the earthly 
Jerusalem,-to be avenged of her adversary. Which also he shall do in the time of 
his kingdom: he shall remove his kingdom into that [city], and shall sit in the 
temple of God, leading astray those who worship him, as if he were Christ. To 
this purpose Daniel says again: "And he shall desolate the holy place; and sin 
has been given for a sacrifice, 
and righteousness been cast away in the earth, and he has been active 
(fecit), and gone on prosperously." 
And the angel Gabriel, when explaining his vision, states with regard to this 
person: "And towards the end of their kingdom a king of a most fierce 
countenance shall arise, one understanding [dark] questions, and exceedingly 
powerful, full of wonders; and he shall corrupt, direct, influence 
(faciet), and put strong men down, the holy people likewise; and his yoke 
shall be directed as a wreath [round their neck]; deceit shall be in his hand, 
and he shall be lifted up in his heart: he shall also ruin many by deceit, and 
lead many to perdition, bruising them in his hand like eggs." 
And then he points out the time that his tyranny shall last, during which the 
saints shall be put to flight, they who offer a pure sacrifice unto God: "And in 
the midst of the week," he says, "the sacrifice and the libation shall be taken 
away, and the abomination of desolation [shall be brought] into the temple: even 
unto the consummation of the time shall the desolation be complete." 
Now three years and six months constitute the half-week.
5. From all these passages are revealed to us, not merely the particulars of 
the apostasy, and [the doings] of him who concentrates in himself every satanic 
error, but also, that there is one and the same God the Father, who was declared 
by the prophets, but made manifest by Christ. For if what Daniel prophesied 
concerning the end has been confirmed by the Lord, when He said, "When ye shall 
see the abomination of desolation, which has been spoken of by Daniel the 
prophet" 
(and the angel Gabriel gave the interpretation of the visions to Daniel, and he 
is the archangel of the Creator (Demiurgi), who also proclaimed to Mary 
the visible coining and the incarnation of Christ), then one and the same God is 
most manifestly pointed out, who sent the prophets, and made promise 
of the Son, and called us into His knowledge.

Chapter XXVI.-John and Daniel Have 
  Predicted the Dissolution and Desolation of the Roman Empire, Which Shall 
  Precede the End of the World and the Eternal Kingdom of Christ. The Gnostics 
  are Refuted, Those Tools of Satan, Who Invent Another Father Different from 
  the Creator.
1. In a still clearer light has John, in the Apocalypse, indicated to the 
Lord's disciples what shall happen in the last times, and concerning the ten 
kings who shall then arise, among whom the empire which now rules [the earth] 
shall be partitioned. He teaches us what the ten horns shall be which were seen 
by Daniel, telling us that thus it had been said to him: "And the ten horns 
which thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet, but shall 
receive power as if kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and give 
their strength and power to the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and 
the Lamb shall overcome them, because He is the Lord of lords and the King of 
kings." 
It is manifest, therefore, that of these [potentates], he who is to come shall 
slay three, and subject the remainder to his power, and that he shall be himself 
the eighth among them. And they shall lay Babylon waste, and burn her with fire, 
and shall give their kingdom to the beast, and put the Church to flight. After 
that they shall be destroyed by the coming of our Lord. For that the kingdom 
must be divided, and thus come to ruin, the Lord [declares when He] says: "Every 
kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house 
divided against itself shall not stand." 
It must be, therefore, that the kingdom, the city, and the house be divided into 
ten; and for this reason He has already foreshadowed the partition and division 
[which shall take place]. Daniel also says particularly, that the end of the 
fourth kingdom consists in the toes of the image seen by Nebuchadnezzar, upon 
which came the stone cut out without hands; and as he does himself say: "The 
feet were indeed the one part iron, the other part clay, until the stone was cut 
out without hands, and struck the image upon the iron and clay feet, and dashed 
them into pieces, even to the end." 
Then afterwards, when interpreting this, he says: "And as thou sawest the feet 
and the toes, partly indeed of clay, and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be 
divided, and there shall be in it a root of iron, as thou sawest iron mixed with 
baked clay. And the toes were indeed the one part iron, but the other part 
clay." 
The ten toes, therefore, are these ten kings, among whom the kingdom shall be 
partitioned, of whom some indeed shall be strong and active, or energetic; 
others, again, shall be sluggish and useless, and shall not agree; as also 
Daniel says: "Some part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part shall be broken 
from it. As thou sawest the iron mixed with the baked clay, there shall be 
minglings among the human race, but no cohesion one with the other, just as iron 
cannot be welded on to pottery ware." 
And since an end shall take place, he says: "And in the days of these kings 
shall the God of heaven raise up a kingdom which shall never decay, and His 
kingdom shall not be left to another people. It shall break in pieces and 
shatter all kingdoms, and shall itself be exalted for ever. As thou sawest that 
the stone was cut without hands from the mountain, and brake in pieces the baked 
clay, the iron, the brass, the silver, and the gold, God has pointed out to the 
king what shall come to pass after these things; and the dream is true, and the 
interpretation trustworthy." 

2. If therefore the great God showed future things by Daniel, and confirmed 
them by His Son; and if Christ is the stone which is cut out without hands, who 
shall destroy temporal kingdoms, and introduce an eternal one, which is the 
resurrection of the just; as he declares, "The God of heaven shall raise up a 
kingdom which shall never be destroyed,"-let those thus confuted come to their 
senses, who reject the Creator (Demiurgum), and do not agree that the 
prophets were sent beforehand from the same Father from whom also the Lord came, 
but who assert that prophecies originated from diverse powers. For those things 
which have been predicted by the Creator alike through all the prophets has 
Christ fulfilled in the end, ministering to His Father's will, and completing 
His dispensations with regard to the human race. Let those persons, therefore, 
who blaspheme the Creator, either by openly expressed words, such as the 
disciples of Marcion, or by a perversion of the sense [of Scripture], as those 
of Valentinus and all the Gnostics falsely so called, be recognised as agents of 
Satan by all those who worship God; through whose agency Satan now, and not 
before, has been seen to speak against God, even Him who has prepared eternal 
fire for every kind of apostasy. For he did not venture to blaspheme his Lord 
openly of himself; as also in the beginning he led man astray through the 
instrumentality of the serpent, concealing himself as it were from God. Truly 
has Justin remarked: 
That before the Lord's appearance Satan never dared to blaspheme God, inasmuch 
as he did not yet know his own sentence, because it was contained in parables 
and allegories; but that after the Lord's appearance, when he had clearly 
ascertained from the words of Christ and His apostles that eternal fire has been 
prepared for him as he apostatized from God of his own free-will, and likewise 
for all who unrepentant continue in the apostasy, he now blasphemes, by means of 
such men, the Lord who brings judgment [upon him] as being already condemned, 
and imputes the guilt of his apostasy to his Maker, not to his own voluntary 
disposition. Just as it is with those who break the laws, when punishment 
overtakes them: they throw the blame upon those who frame the laws, but not upon 
themselves. In like manner do those men, filled with a satanic spirit, bring 
innumerable accusations against our Creator, who has both given to us the spirit 
of life, and established a law adapted for all; and they will not admit that the 
judgment of God is just. Wherefore also they set about imagining some other 
Father who neither cares about nor exercises a providence over our affairs, nay, 
one who even approves of all sins.

Chapter XXVII.-The Future Judgment 
  by Christ. Communion with and Separation from the Divine Being. The Eternal 
  Punishment of Unbelievers.
1. If the Father, then, does not exercise judgment, [it follows] that 
judgment does not belong to Him, or that He consents to all those actions which 
take place; and if He does not judge, all persons will be equal, and accounted 
in the same condition. The advent of Christ will therefore be without an object, 
yea, absurd, inasmuch as [in that case] He exercises no judicial power. For "He 
came to divide a man against his father, and the daughter against the mother, 
and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law; " 
and when two are in one bed, to take the one, and to leave the other; and of two 
women grinding at the mill, to take one and leave the other: 
[also] at the time of the end, to order the reapers to collect first the tares 
together, and bind them in bundles, and burn them with unquenchable fire, but to 
gather up the wheat into the barn; 
and to call the lambs into the kingdom prepared for them, but to send the goats 
into everlasting fire, which has been prepared by His Father for the devil and 
his angels. 
And why is this? Has the Word come for the ruin and for the resurrection of 
many? For the ruin, certainly, of those who do not believe Him, to whom also He 
has threatened a greater damnation in the judgment-day than that of Sodom and 
Gomorrah; 
but for the resurrection of believers, and those who do the will of His Father 
in heaven. If then the advent of the Son comes indeed alike to all, but is for 
the purpose of judging, and separating the believing from the unbelieving, 
since, as those who believe do His will agreeably to their own choice, and as, 
[also] agreeably to their own choice, the disobedient do not consent to His 
doctrine; it is manifest that His Father has made all in a like condition, each 
person having a choice of his own, and a free understanding; and that He has 
regard to all things, and exercises a providence over all, "making His sun to 
rise upon the evil and on the good, and sending rain upon the just and 
unjust." 

2. And to as many as continue in their love towards God, does He grant 
communion with Him. But communion with God is life and light, and the enjoyment 
of all the benefits which He has in store. But on as many as, according to their 
own choice, depart from God. He inflicts that separation from Himself which they 
have chosen of their own accord. But separation from God is death, and 
separation from light is darkness; and separation from God consists in the loss 
of all the benefits which He has in store. Those, therefore, who cast away by 
apostasy these forementioned things, being in fact destitute of all good, do 
experience every kind of punishment. God, however, does not punish them 
immediately of Himself, but that punishment falls upon them because they are 
destitute of all that is good. Now, good things are eternal and without end with 
God, and therefore the loss of these is also eternal and never-ending. It is in 
this matter just as occurs in the case of a flood of light: those who have 
blinded themselves, or have been blinded by others, are for ever deprived of the 
enjoyment of light. It is not, [however], that the light has inflicted upon them 
the penalty of blindness, but it is that the blindness itself has brought 
calamity upon them: and therefore the Lord declared, "He that believeth in Me is 
not condemned," 
that is, is not separated from God, for he is united to God through faith. On 
the other hand, He says, "He that believeth not is condemned already, because he 
has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God; "that is, he 
separated himself from God of his own accord. "For this is the condemnation, 
that light is come into this world, and men have loved darkness rather than 
light. For every one who doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the 
light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the 
light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that he has wrought them in 
God."

Chapter XXVIII.-The Distinction to 
  Be Made Between the Righteous and the Wicked. The Future Apostasy in the Time 
  of Anti-Christ, and the End of the World.
1. Inasmuch, then, as in this world (ai0w=ni) some 
persons betake themselves to the light, and by faith unite themselves with God, 
but others shun the light, and separate themselves from God, the Word of God 
comes preparing a fit habitation for both. For those indeed who are in the 
light, that they may derive enjoyment from it, and from the good things 
contained in it; but for those in darkness, that they may partake in its 
calamities. And on this account He says, that those upon the right hand are 
called into the kingdom of heaven, but that those on the left He will send into 
eternal fire for they have deprived themselves of all good.
2. And for this reason the apostle says: "Because they received not the love 
of God, that they might be saved, therefore God shall also send them the 
operation of error, that they may believe a lie, that they all may be judged who 
have not believed the truth, but consented to unrighteousness." 
For when he (Antichrist) is come, and of his own accord concentrates in his own 
person the apostasy, and accomplishes whatever he shall do according to his own 
will and choice, sitting also in the temple of God, so that his dupes may adore 
him as the Christ; wherefore also shall he deservedly "be cast into the lake of 
fire: " 
[this will happen according to divine appointment], God by His prescience 
foreseeing all this, and at the proper time sending such a man, "that they may 
believe a lie, that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but 
consented to unrighteousness; "whose coming John has thus described in the 
Apocalypse: "And the beast which I had seen was like unto a leopard, and his 
feet as of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon 
conferred his own power upon him, and his throne, and great might. And one of 
his heads was as it were slain unto death; and his deadly wound was healed, and 
all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon because 
he gave power to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like 
unto this beast, and who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto 
him a mouth speaking great things, and blasphemy and power was given to him 
during forty and two months. And he opened his mouth for blasphemy against God, 
to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. And 
power was given him over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation. And 
all who dwell upon the earth worshipped him, [every one] whose name was not 
written in the book of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any 
one have ears, let him hear. If any one shall lead into captivity, he shall go 
into captivity. If any shall slay with the sword, he must be slain with the 
sword. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints." 
After this he likewise describes his armour-bearer, whom he also terms a false 
prophet: "He spake as a dragon, and exercised all the power of the first beast 
in his sight, and caused the earth, and those that dwell therein, to adore the 
first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he shall perform great wonders, 
so that he can even cause fire to descend from heaven upon the earth in the 
sight of men, and he shall lead the inhabitants of the earth astray." 
Let no one imagine that he performs these wonders by divine power, but by the 
working of magic. And we must not be surprised if, since the demons and apostate 
spirits are at his service, he through their means performs wonders, by which he 
leads the inhabitants of the earth astray. John says further: "And he shall 
order an image of the beast to be made, and he shall give breath to the image, 
so that the image shall speak; and he shall cause those to be slain who will not 
adore it." He says also: "And he will cause a mark [to be put] in the forehead 
and in the fight hand, that no one may be able to buy or sell, unless he who has 
the mark of the name of the beast or the number of his name; and the number is 
six hundred and sixty-six," 
that is, six times a hundred, six times ten, and six units. [He gives this] as a 
summing up of the whole of that apostasy which has taken place during six 
thousand years.
3. For in as many days as this world was made, in so many thousand years 
shall it be concluded. And for this reason the Scripture says: "Thus the heaven 
and the earth were finished, and all their adornment. And God brought to a 
conclusion upon the sixth day the works that He had made; and God rested upon 
the seventh day from all His works." 
This is an account of the things formerly created, as also it is a prophecy of 
what is to come. For the day of the Lord is as a thousand years; 
and in six days created things were completed: it is evident, therefore, that 
they will come to an end at the sixth thousand year.
4. And therefore throughout all time, man, having been moulded at the 
beginning by the hands of God, that is, of the Son and of the Spirit, is made 
after the image and likeness of God: the chaff, indeed, which is the apostasy, 
being cast away; but the wheat, that is, those who bring forth fruit to God in 
faith, being gathered into the barn. And for this cause tribulation is necessary 
for those who are saved, that having been after a manner broken up, and rendered 
fine, and sprinkled over by the patience of the Word of God, and set on fire 
[for purification], they may be fitted for the royal banquet. As a certain man 
of ours said, when he was condemned to the wild beasts because of his testimony 
with respect to God: "I am the wheat of Christ, and am ground by the teeth of 
the wild beasts, that I may be found the pure bread of God." 


Chapter XXIX.-All Things Have Been 
  Created for the Service of Man. The Deceits, Wickedness, and Apostate Power of 
  Antichrist. This Was Prefigured at the Deluge, as Afterwards by the 
  Persecution of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
1. In the previous books I have set forth the causes for which God permitted 
these things to be made, and have pointed out that all such have been created 
for the benefit of that human nature which is saved, ripening for immortality 
that which is [possessed] of its own free will and its own power, and preparing 
and rendering it more adapted for eternal subjection to God. And therefore the 
creation is suited to [the wants of] man; for man was not made for its sake, but 
creation for the sake of man. Those nations however, who did not of themselves 
raise up their eyes unto heaven, nor returned thanks to their Maker, nor wished 
to behold the light of truth, but who were like blind mice concealed in the 
depths of ignorance, the word justly reckons "as waste water from a sink, and as 
the turning-weight of a balance-in fact, as nothing; " 
so far useful and serviceable to the just, as stubble conduces towards the 
growth of the wheat, and its straw, by means of combustion, serves for working 
gold. And therefore, when in the end the Church shall be suddenly caught up from 
this, it is said, "There shall be tribulation such as has not been since the 
beginning, neither shall be." 
For this is the last contest of the righteous, in which, when they overcome they 
are crowned with incorruption.
2. And there is therefore in this beast, when he comes, a recapitulation made 
of all sorts of iniquity and of every deceit, in order that all apostate power, 
flowing into and being shut up in him, may be sent into the furnace of fire. 
Fittingly, therefore, shall his name possess the number six hundred and 
sixty-six, since he sums up in his own person all the commixture of wickedness 
which took place previous to the deluge, due to the apostasy of the angels. For 
Noah was six hundred years old when the deluge came upon the earth, sweeping 
away the rebellious world, for the sake of that most infamous generation which 
lived in the times of Noah. And [Antichrist] also sums up every error of devised 
idols since the flood, together with the slaying of the prophets and the cutting 
off of the just. For that image which was set up by Nebuchadnezzar had indeed a 
height of sixty cubits, while the breadth was six cubits; on account of which 
Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, when they did not worship it, were cast into a 
furnace of fire, pointing out prophetically, by what happened to them, the wrath 
against the righteous which shall arise towards the [time of the] end. For that 
image, taken as a whole, was a prefiguring of this man's coming, decreeing that 
he should undoubtedly himself alone be worshipped by all men. Thus, then, the 
six hundred years of Noah, in whose time the deluge occurred because of the 
apostasy, and the number of the cubits of the image for which these just men 
were sent into the fiery furnace, do indicate the number of the name of that man 
in whom is concentrated the whole apostasy of six thousand years, and 
unrighteousness, and wickedness, and false prophecy, and deception; for which 
things' sake a cataclysm of fire shall also come [upon the earth].

Chapter XXX.-Although Certain as to 
  the Number of the Name of Antichrist, Yet We Should Come to No Rash 
  Conclusions as to the Name Itself, Because This Number is Capable of Being 
  Fitted to Many Names. Reasons for This Point Being Reserved by the Holy 
  Spirit. Antichrist's Reign and Death.
1. Such, then, being the state of the case, and this number being found in 
all the most approved and ancient copies 
[of the Apocalypse], and those men who saw John face to face bearing their 
testimony [to it]; while reason also leads us to conclude that the number of the 
name of the beast, [if reckoned] according to the Greek mode of calculation by 
the [value of] the letters contained in it, will amount to six hundred and sixty 
and six; that is, the number of tens shall be equal to that of the hundreds, and 
the number of hundreds equal to that of the units (for that number which 
[expresses] the digit six being adhered to throughout, indicates the 
recapitulations of that apostasy, taken in its full extent, which occurred at 
the beginning, during the intermediate periods, and which shall take place at 
the end),-I do not know how it is that some have erred following the ordinary 
mode of speech, and have vitiated the middle number in the name, deducting the 
amount of fifty from it, so that instead of six decads they will have it that 
there is but one. [I am inclined to think that this occurred through the fault 
of the copyists, as is wont to happen, since numbers also are expressed by 
letters; so that the Greek letter which expresses the number sixty was easily 
expanded into the letter Iota of the Greeks.] 
Others then received this reading without examination; some in their simplicity, 
and upon their own responsibility, making use of this number expressing one 
decad; while some, in their inexperience, have ventured to seek out a name which 
should contain the erroneous and spurious number. Now, as regards those who have 
done this in simplicity, and without evil intent, we are at liberty to assume 
that pardon will be granted them by God. But as for those who, for the sake of 
vainglory, lay it down for certain that names containing the spurious number are 
to be accepted, and affirm that this name, hit upon by themselves, is that of 
him who is to come; such persons shall not come forth without loss, because they 
have led into error both themselves and those who confided in them. Now, in the 
first place, it is loss to wander from the truth, and to imagine that as being 
the case which is not; then again, as there shall be no light punishment 
[inflicted] upon him who either adds or subtracts anything from the 
Scripture, 
under that such a person must necessarily fall. Moreover, another danger, by no 
means trifling, shall overtake those who falsely presume that they know the name 
of Antichrist. For if these men assume one [number], when this [Antichrist] 
shall come having another, they will be easily led away by him, as supposing him 
not to be the expected one, who must be guarded against.
2. These men, therefore, ought to learn [what really is the state of the 
case], and go back to the true number of the name, that they be not reckoned 
among false prophets. But, knowing the sure number declared by Scripture, that 
is, six hundred sixty and six, let them await, in the first place, the division 
of the kingdom into ten; then, in the next place, when these kings are reigning, 
and beginning to set their affairs in order, and advance their kingdom, [let 
them learn] to acknowledge that he who shall come claiming the kingdom for 
himself, and shall terrify those men of whom we have been speaking, having a 
name containing the aforesaid number, is truly the abomination of desolation. 
This, too, the apostle affirms: "When they shall say, Peace and safety, then 
sudden destruction shall come upon them." 
And Jeremiah does not merely point out his sudden coming, but he even indicates 
the tribe from which he shall come, where he says, "We shall hear the voice of 
his swift horses from Dan; the whole earth shall be moved by the voice of the 
neighing of his galloping horses: he shall also come and devour the earth, and 
the fulness thereof, the city also, and they that dwell therein." 
This, too, is the reason that this tribe is not reckoned in the Apocalypse along 
with those which are saved. 

3. It is therefore more certain, and less hazardous, to await the fulfilment 
of the prophecy, than to be making surmises, and casting about for any names 
that may present themselves, inasmuch as many names can be found possessing the 
number mentioned; and the same question will, after all, remain unsolved. For if 
there are many names found possessing this number, it will be asked which among 
them shall the coming man bear. It is not through a want of names containing the 
number of that name that I say this, but on account of the fear of God, and zeal 
for the truth: for the name Evanthas (Euanqas) contains the required 
number, but I make no allegation regarding it. Then also Lateinos 
(Lateinos) has the number six hundred and sixty-six; and it is a very probable 
[solution], this being the name of the last kingdom [of the four seen by 
Daniel]. For the Latins are they who at present bear rule: 
I will not, however, make any boast over this [coincidence]. Teitan too, 
(Teitan, the first syllable being written with the two Greek vowels e and i), among all the names 
which are found among us, is rather worthy of credit. For it has in itself the 
predicted number, and is composed of six letters, each syllable containing three 
letters; and [the word itself] is ancient, and removed from ordinary use; for 
among our kings we find none bearing this name Titan, nor have any of the idols 
which are worshipped in public among the Greeks and barbarians this appellation. 
Among many persons, too, this name is accounted divine, so that even the sun is 
termed "Titan" by those who do now possess [the rule]. This word, too, contains 
a certain outward appearance of vengeance, and of one inflicting merited 
punishment because he (Antichrist) pretends that he vindicates the 
oppressed. 
And besides this, it is an ancient name, one worthy of credit, of royal dignity, 
and still further, a name belonging to a tyrant. Inasmuch, then, as this name 
"Titan" has so much to recommend it, there is a strong degree of probability, 
that from among the many [names suggested], we infer, that perchance he who is 
to come shall be called "Titan." We will not, however, incur the risk of 
pronouncing positively as to the name of Antichrist; for if it were necessary 
that his name should be distinctly revealed in this present time, it would have 
been announced by him who beheld the apocalyptic vision. For that was seen no 
very long time since, but almost in our day, towards the end of Domitian's 
reign.
4. But he indicates the number of the name now, that when this man comes we 
may avoid him, being aware who he is: the name, however, is suppressed, because 
it is not worthy of being proclaimed by the Holy Spirit. For if it had been 
declared by Him, he (Antichrist) might perhaps continue for a long period. But 
now as "he was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the abyss, and goes into 
perdition," 
as one who has no existence; so neither has his name been declared, for the name 
of that which does not exist is not proclaimed. But when this Antichrist shall 
have devastated all things in this world, he will reign for three years and six 
months, and sit in the temple at Jerusalem; and then the Lord will come from 
heaven in the clouds, in the glory of the Father, sending this man and those who 
follow him into the lake of fire; but bringing in for the righteous the times of 
the kingdom, that is, the rest, the hallowed seventh day; and restoring to 
Abraham the promised inheritance, in which kingdom the Lord declared, that "many 
coming from the east and from the west should sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and 
Jacob." 


Chapter XXXI.-The Preservation of 
  Our Bodies is Confirmed by the Resurrection and Ascension of Christ: the Souls 
  of the Saints During the Intermediate Period are in a State of Expectation of 
  that Time When They Shall Receive Their Perfect and Consummated 
  Glory.
1. Since, again, some who are reckoned among the orthodox go beyond the 
pre-arranged plan for the exaltation of the just, and are ignorant of the 
methods by which they are disciplined beforehand for incorruption, they thus 
entertain heretical opinions. For the heretics, despising the handiwork of God, 
and not admitting the salvation of their flesh, while they also treat the 
promise of God contemptuously, and pass beyond God altogether in the sentiments 
they form, affirm that immediately upon their death they shall pass above the 
heavens and the Demiurge, and go to the Mother (Achamoth) or to that Father whom 
they have feigned. Those persons, therefore, who disallow a resurrection 
affecting the whole man (universam reprobant resurrectionem), and as far 
as in them lies remove it from the midst [of the Christian scheme], how can they 
be wondered at, if again they know nothing as to the plan of the resurrection? 
For they do not choose to understand, that if these things are as they say, the 
Lord Himself, in whom they profess to believe, did not rise again upon the third 
day; but immediately upon His expiring on the cross, undoubtedly departed on 
high, leaving His body to the earth. But the case was, that for three days He 
dwelt in the place where the dead were, as the prophet says concerning Him: "And 
the Lord remembered His dead saints who slept formerly in the land of sepulture; 
and He descended to them, to rescue and save them." 
And the Lord Himself says, "As Jonas remained three days and three nights in the 
whale's belly, so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth." 
Then also the apostle says, "But when He ascended, what is it but that He also 
descended into the lower parts of the earth? " 
This, too, David says when prophesying of Him, "And thou hast delivered my soul 
from the nethermost hell; " 
and on His rising again the third day, He said to Mary, who was the first to see 
and to worship Him, "Touch Me not, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; 
but go to the disciples, and say unto them, I ascend unto My Father, and unto 
your Father." 

2. If, then, the Lord observed the law of the dead, that He might become the 
first-begotten from the dead, and tarried until the third day "in the lower 
parts of the earth; " 
then afterwards rising in the flesh, so that He even showed the print of the 
nails to His disciples, 
He thus ascended to the Father;-[if all these things occurred, I say], how must 
these men not be put to confusion, who allege that "the lower parts" refer to 
this world of ours, but that their tuner man, leaving the body here, ascends 
into the super-celestial place? For as the Lord "went away in the midst of the 
shadow of death," 
where the souls of the dead were, yet afterwards arose in the body, and after 
the resurrection was taken up [into heaven], it is manifest that the souls of 
His disciples also, upon whose account the Lord underwent these things, shall go 
away into the invisible place allotted to them by God, and there remain until 
the resurrection, awaiting that event; then receiving their bodies, and rising 
in their entirety, that is bodily, just as the Lord arose, they shall come thus 
into the presence of God. "For no disciple is above the Master, but every one 
that is perfect shall be as his Master." 
As our Master, therefore, did not at once depart, taking flight [to heaven], but 
awaited the time of His resurrection prescribed by the Father, which had been 
also shown forth through Jonas, and rising again after three days was taken up 
[to heaven]; so ought we also to await the time of our resurrection prescribed 
by God and foretold by the prophets, and so, rising, be taken up, as many as the 
Lord shall account worthy of this [privilege]. 


Chapter XXXII.-In that Flesh in 
  Which the Saints Have Suffered So Many Afflictions, They Shall Receive the 
  Fruits of Their Labours; Especially Since All Creation Waits for This, and God 
  Promises It to Abraham and His Seed.
1. Inasmuch, therefore, as the opinions of certain [orthodox persons] are 
derived from heretical discourses, they are both ignorant of God's 
dispensations, and of the mystery of the resurrection of the just, and of the 
[earthly] kingdom which is the commencement of incorruption, by means of which 
kingdom those who shall be worthy are accustomed gradually to partake of the 
divine nature (capere Deum 
); and it is necessary to tell them respecting those things, that it behoves the 
righteous first to receive the promise of the inheritance which God promised to 
the fathers, and to reign in it, when they rise again to behold God in this 
creation which is renovated, and that the judgment should take place afterwards. 
For it is just that in that very creation in which they toiled or were 
afflicted, being proved in every way by suffering, they should receive the 
reward of their suffering; and that in the creation in which they were slain 
because of their love to God, in that they should be revived again; and that in 
the creation in which they endured servitude, in that they should reign. For God 
is rich in all things, and all things are His. It is fitting, therefore, that 
the creation itself, being restored to its primeval condition, should without 
restraint be under the dominion of the righteous; and the apostle has made this 
plain in the Epistle to the Romans, when he thus speaks: "For the expectation of 
the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature 
has been subjected to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath 
subjected the same in hope; since the creature itself shall also be delivered 
from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of 
God." 

2. Thus, then, the promise of God, which He gave to Abraham, remains 
stedfast. For thus He said: "Lift up thine eyes, and look from this place where 
now thou art, towards the north and south, and east and west. For all the earth 
which thou seest, I will give to thee and to thy seed, even for ever." 
And again He says, "Arise, and go through the length and breadth of the land, 
since I will give it unto thee; " 
and [yet] he did not receive an inheritance in it, not even a footstep, but was 
always a stranger and a pilgrim therein. 
And upon the death of Sarah his wife, when the Hittites were willing to bestow 
upon him a place where he might bury her, he declined it as a gift, but bought 
the burying-place (giving for it four hundred talents of silver) from Ephron the 
son of Zohar the Hittite. 
Thus did he await patiently the promise of God, and was unwilling to appear to 
receive from men, what God had promised to give him, when He said again to him 
as follows: "I will give this land to thy seed, from the river of Egypt even 
unto the great river Euphrates." 
If, then, God promised him the inheritance of the land, yet he did not receive 
it during all the time of his sojourn there, it must be, that together with his 
seed, that is, those who fear God and believe in Him, he shall receive it at the 
resurrection of the just. For his seed is the Church, which receives the 
adoption to God through the Lord, as John the Baptist said: "For God is able 
from the stones to raise up children to Abraham." 
Thus also the apostle says in the Epistle to the Galatians: "But ye, brethren, 
as Isaac was, are the children of the promise." 
And again, in the same Epistle, he plainly declares that they who have believed 
in Christ do receive Christ, the promise to Abraham thus saying, "The promises 
were spoken to Abraham, and to his seed. Now He does not say, And of seeds, as 
if [He spake] of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ." 
And again, confirming his former words, he says, "Even as Abraham believed God, 
and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Know ye therefore, that they 
which are of faith are the children of Abraham. But the Scripture, fore-seeing 
that God would justify the heathen through faith, declared to Abraham 
beforehand, That in thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which are of 
faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham." 
Thus, then, they who are of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham, and 
these are the children of Abraham. Now God made promise of the earth to Abraham 
and his seed; yet neither Abraham nor his seed, that is, those who are justified 
by faith, do now receive any inheritance in it; but they shall receive it at the 
resurrection of the just. For God is true and faithful; and on this account He 
said, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth." 


Chapter XXXIII.-Further Proofs of 
  the Same Proposition, Drawn from the Promises Made by Christ, When He Declared 
  that He Would Drink of the Fruit of the Vine with His Disciples in His 
  Father's Kingdom, While at the Same Time He Promised to Reward Them an 
  Hundred-Fold, and to Make Them Partake of Banquets. The Blessing Pronounced by 
  Jacob Had Pointed Out This Already, as Papias and the Elders Have Interpreted 
  It.
1. For this reason, when about to undergo His sufferings, that He might 
declare to Abraham and those with him the glad tidings of the inheritance being 
thrown open, [Christ], after He had given thanks while holding the cup, and had 
drunk of it, and given it to the disciples, said to them: "Drink ye all of it: 
this is My blood of the new covenant, which shall be shed for many for the 
remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of the fruit 
of this vine, until that day when I will drink it new with you in my Father's 
kingdom." 
Thus, then, He will Himself renew the inheritance of the earth, and will 
re-organize the mystery of the glory of [His] sons; as David says, "He who hath 
renewed the face of the earth." 
He promised to drink of the fruit of the vine with His disciples, thus 
indicating both these points: the inheritance of the earth in which the new 
fruit of the vine is drunk, and the resurrection of His disciples in the flesh. 
For the new flesh which rises again is the same which also received the new cup. 
And He cannot by any means be understood as drinking of the fruit of the vine 
when settled down with his [disciples] above in a super-celestial place; nor, 
again, are they who drink it devoid of flesh, for to drink of that which flows 
from the vine pertains to flesh, and not spirit.
2. And for this reason the Lord declared, "When thou makest a dinner or a 
supper, do not call thy friends, nor thy neighbours, nor thy kinsfolk, lest they 
ask thee in return, and so repay thee. But call the lame, the blind, and the 
poor, and thou shall be blessed, since they cannot recompense thee, but a 
recompense shall be made thee at the resurrection of the just." 
And again He says, "Whosoever shall have left lands, or houses, or parents, or 
brethren, or children because of Me, he shall receive in this world an 
hundred-fold, and in that to come he shall inherit eternal life." 
For what are the hundred-fold [rewards] in this word, the entertainments given 
to the poor, and the suppers for which a return is made? These are [to take 
place] in the times of the kingdom, that is, upon the seventh day, which has 
been sanctified, in which God rested from all the works which He created, which 
is the true Sabbath of the righteous, which they shall not be engaged in any 
earthly occupation; but shall have a table at hand prepared for them by God, 
supplying them with all sorts of dishes.
3. The blessing of Isaac with which he blessed his younger son Jacob has the 
same meaning, when he says, "Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a 
full field which the Lord has blessed." 
But "the field is the world." 
And therefore he added, "God give to thee of the dew of heaven, and of the 
fatness of the earth, plenty of corn and wine. And let the nations serve thee, 
and kings bow down to thee; and be thou lord over thy brother, and thy father's 
sons shall bow down to thee: cursed shall be he who shall curse thee, and 
blessed shall be he who shall bless thee." 
If any one, then, does not accept these things as referring to the appointed 
kingdom, he must fall into much contradiction and contrariety, as is the case 
with the Jews, who are involved in absolute perplexity. For not only did not the 
nations in this life serve this Jacob; but even after he had received the 
blessing, he himself going forth [from his home], served his uncle Laban the 
Syrian for twenty years; 
and not only was he not made lord of his brother, but he did himself bow down 
before his brother Esau, upon his return from Mesopotamia to his father, and 
offered many gifts to him. 
Moreover, in what way did he inherit much corn and wine here, he who emigrated 
to Egypt because of the famine which possessed the land in which he was 
dwelling, and became Subject to Pharaoh, who was then ruling over Egypt? The 
predicted blessing, therefore, belongs unquestionably to the times of the 
kingdom, when the righteous shall bear rule upon their rising from the 
dead; 
when also the creation, having been renovated and set free, shall fructify with 
an abundance of all kinds of food, from the dew of heaven, and from the 
fertility of the earth: as the elders who saw John, the disciple of the Lord, 
related that they had heard from him how the Lord used to teach in regard to 
these times, and say: The days will come, in which vines shall grow, each having 
ten thousand branches, and in each branch ten thousand twigs, and in each 
true 
twig ten thousand shoots, and in each one of the shoots ten thousand dusters, 
and on every one of the clusters ten thousand grapes, and every grape when 
pressed will give five and twenty metretes of wine. And when any one of the 
saints shall lay hold of a cluster, 
another shall cry out, "I am a better cluster, take me; bless the Lord through 
me." In like manner [the Lord declared] that a grain of wheat would produce ten 
thousand ears, and that every ear should have ten thousand grains, and every 
grain would yield ten pounds (quinque bilibres) of clear, pure, fine 
flour; and that all other fruit-bearing trees, 
and seeds and grass, would produce in similar proportions (secundum 
congruentiam iis consequentem); and that all animals feeding [only] on the 
productions of the earth, should [in those days] become peaceful and harmonious 
among each other, and be in perfect subjection to man.
4. And these things are bone witness to in writing by Papias, the hearer of 
John, and a companion of Polycarp, in his fourth book; for there were five books 
compiled (suntetagme/na) by him. 
And he says in addition, "Now these things are credible to believers." And he 
says that, "when the traitor Judas did not give credit to them, and put the 
question, `How then can things about to bring forth so abundantly be wrought by 
the Lord? 'the Lord declared, `They who shall come to these [times] shall see.'" 
When prophesying of these times, therefore, Esaias says: "The wolf also shall 
feed with the lamb, and the leopard shall take his rest with the kid; the calf 
also, and the bull, and the lion shall eat together; and a little boy shall lead 
them. The ox and the bear shall feed together, and their young ones shall agree 
together; and the lion shall eat straw as well as the ox. And the infant boy 
shall thrust his hand into the asp's den, into the nest also of the adder's 
brood; and they shall do no harm, nor have power to hurt anything in my holy 
mountain." And again he says, in recapitulation, "Wolves and lambs shall then 
browse together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and the serpent earth 
as if it were bread; and they shall neither hurt nor annoy anything in my holy 
mountain, saith the Lord." 
I am quite aware that some persons endeavour to refer these words to the case of 
savage men, both of different nations and various habits, who come to believe, 
and when they have believed, act in harmony with the righteous. But although 
this is [true] now with regard to some men coming from various nations to the 
harmony of the faith, nevertheless in the resurrection of the just [the words 
shall also apply] to those animals mentioned. For God is non in all things. And 
it is right that when the creation is restored, all the animals should obey and 
be in subjection to man, and revert to the food originally given by God (for 
they had been originally subjected in obedience to Adam), that is, the 
productions of the earth. But some other occasion, and not the present, is [to 
be sought] for showing that the lion shall [then] feed on straw. And this 
indicates the large size and rich quality of the fruits. For if that animal, the 
lion, feeds upon straw [at that period], of what a quality must the wheat itself 
be whose straw shall serve as suitable food for lions?

Chapter XXXIV.-He Fortifies His 
  Opinions with Regard to the Temporal and Earthly Kingdom of the Saints After 
  Their Resurrection, by the Various Testimonies of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, 
  and Daniel; Also by the Parable of the Servants Watching, to Whom the Lord 
  Promised that He Would Minister.
1. Then, too, Isaiah himself has plainly declared that there shall be joy of 
this nature at the resurrection of the just, when he says: "The dead shall rise 
again; those, too, who are in the tombs shall arise, and those who are in the 
earth shall rejoice. For the dew from Thee is health to them." 
And this again Ezekiel also says: "Behold, I will open your tombs, and will 
bring you forth out of your graves; when I will draw my people from the 
sepulchres, and I will put breath in you, and ye shall live; and I will place 
you on your own land, and ye shall know that I am the Lord." 
And again the same speaks thus: "These things saith the Lord, I will gather 
Israel from all nations whither they have been driven, and I shall be sanctified 
in them in the sight of the sons of the nations: and they shall dwell in their 
own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob. And they shall dwell in it in peace; 
and they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and dwell in hope, when I 
shall cause judgment to fall among all who have dishonoured them, among those 
who encircle them round about; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God, 
and the God of their fathers." 
Now I have shown a short time ago that the church is the seed of Abraham; and 
for this reason, that we may know that He who in the New Testament "raises up 
from the stones children unto Abraham," 
is He who will gather, according to the Old Testament, those that shall be saved 
from all the nations, Jeremiah says: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, 
that they shall no more say, The Lord liveth, who led the children of Israel 
from the north, and from every region whither they had been driven; He will 
restore them to their own land which He gave to their fathers." 

2. That the whole creation shall, according to God's will, obtain a vast 
increase, that it may bring forth and sustain fruits such [as we have 
mentioned], Isaiah declares: "And there shall be upon every high mountain, and 
upon every prominent hill, water running everywhere in that day, when many shall 
perish, when walls shall fall. And the light of the moon shall be as the light 
of the sun, seven times that of the day, when He shall heal the anguish of His 
people, and do away with the pain of His stroke." 
Now "the pain of the stroke" means that inflicted at the beginning upon 
disobedient man in Adam, that is, death; which [stroke] the Lord will heal when 
He raises us from the dead, and restores the inheritance of the fathers, as 
Isaiah again says: "And thou shall be confident in the Lord, and He will cause 
thee to pass over the whole earth, and feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob 
thy father." 
This is what the Lord declared: "Happy are those servants whom the Lord when He 
cometh shall find watching. Verily I say unto you, that He shall gird Himself, 
and make them to sit down [to meat], and will come forth and serve them. And if 
He shall come in the evening watch, and find them so, blessed are they, because 
He shall make them sit down, and minister to them; or if this be in the second, 
or it be in the third, blessed are they." 
Again John also says the very same in the Apocalypse: "Blessed and holy is he 
who has part in the first resurrection." 
Then, too, Isaiah has declared the time when these events shall occur; he says: 
"And I said, Lord, how long? Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and 
the houses be without men, and the earth be left a desert. And after these 
things the Lord shall remove us men far away (longe nos faciet Deus 
homines), and those who shall remain shall multiply upon the earth." 
Then Daniel also says this very thing: "And the kingdom and dominion, and the 
greatness of those under the heaven, is given to the saints of the Most High 
God, whose kingdom is everlasting, and all dominions shall serve and obey 
Him." 
And lest the promise named should be understood as referring to this time, it 
was declared to the prophet: "And come thou, and stand in thy lot at the 
consummation of the days." 

3. Now, that the promises were not announced to the prophets and the fathers 
alone, but to the Churches united to these from the nations, whom also the 
Spirit terms "the islands" (both because they are established in the midst of 
turbulence, suffer the storm of blasphemies, exist as a harbour of safety to 
those in peril, and are the refuge of those who love the height [of heaven], and 
strive to avoid Bythus, that is, the depth of error), Jeremiah thus declares: 
"Hear the word of the Lord, ye nations, and declare it to the isles afar off; 
say ye, that the Lord will scatter Israel, He will gather him, and keep him, as 
one feeding his flock of sheep. For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and rescued 
him from the hand of one stronger than he. And they shall come and rejoice m 
Mount Zion, and shall come to what is good, and into a land of wheat, and wine, 
and fruits, of animals and of sheep; and their soul shall be as a tree bearing 
fruit, and they shall hunger no more. At that time also shall the virgins 
rejoice in the company of the young men: the old men, too, shall be glad, and I 
will turn their sorrow into joy; and I will make them exult, and will magnify 
them, and satiate the souls of the priests the sons of Levi; and my people shall 
be satiated with my goodness." 
Now, in the preceding book 
I have shown that all the disciples of the Lord are Levites and priests, they 
who used in the temple to profane the Sabbath, but are blameless. 
Promises of such a nature, therefore, do indicate in the clearest manner the 
feasting of that creation in the kingdom of the righteous, which God promises 
that He will Himself serve.
4. Then again, speaking of Jerusalem, and of Him reigning there, Isaiah 
declares, "Thus saith the Lord, Happy is he who hath seed in Zion, and servants 
in Jerusalem. Behold, a righteous king shall reign, and princes shall rule with 
judgment" 
And with regard to the foundation on which it shall be rebuilt, he says: 
"Behold, I will lay in order for thee a carbuncle stone, and sapphire for thy 
foundations; and I will lay thy ramparts with jasper, and thy gates with 
crystal, and thy wall with choice stones: and all thy children shall be taught 
of God, and great shall be the peace of thy children; and in righteousness shalt 
thou be built up." 
And yet again does he say the same thing: "Behold, I make Jerusalem a rejoicing, 
and my people [a joy]; for the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, 
nor the voice of crying. Also there shall not be there any immature [one], nor 
an old man who does not fulfil his time: for the youth shall be of a hundred 
years; and the sinner shall die a hundred years old, yet shall be accursed. And 
they shall build houses, and inhabit them themselves; and shall plant vineyards, 
and eat the fruit of them themselves, and shall drink wine. And they shall not 
build, and others inhabit; neither shall they prepare the vineyard, and others 
eat. For as the days of the tree of life shall be the days of the people in 
thee; for the works of their hands shall endure." 


Chapter XXXV.-He Contends that These 
  Testimonies Already Alleged Cannot Be Understood Allegorically of Celestial 
  Blessings, But that They Shall Have Their Fulfilment After the Coming of 
  Antichrist, and the Resurrection, in the Terrestrial Jerusalem. To the Former 
  Prophecies He Subjoins Others Drawn from Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the Apocalypse 
  of John.
1. If, however, any shall endeavour to allegorize [prophecies] of this kind, 
they shall not be found consistent with themselves in all points, and shall be 
confuted by the teaching of the very expressions [in question]. For example: 
"When the cities" of the Gentiles "shall be desolate, so that they be not 
inhabited, and the houses so that there shall be no men in them and the land 
shall be left desolate." 
"For, behold," says Isaiah, "the day of the Lord cometh past remedy, full of 
fury and wrath, to lay waste the city of the earth, and to root sinners out of 
it." 
And again he says, "Let him be taken away, that he behold not the glory of 
God." 
And when these things are done, he says, "God will remove men far away, and 
those that are left shall multiply in the earth." 
"And they shall build houses, and shall inhabit them themselves: and plant 
vineyards, and eat of them themselves." 
For all these and other words were unquestionably spoken in reference to the 
resurrection of the just, which takes place after the coming of Antichrist, and 
the destruction of all nations under his rule; in [the times of] which 
[resurrection] the righteous shall reign in the earth, waxing stronger by the 
sight of the Lord: and through Him they shall become accustomed to partake in 
the glory of God the Father, and shall enjoy in the kingdom intercourse and 
communion with the holy angels, and union with spiritual beings; and [with 
respect to] those whom the Lord shall find in the flesh, awaiting Him from 
heaven, and who have suffered tribulation, as well as escaped the hands of the 
Wicked one. For it is in reference to them that the prophet says: "And those 
that are left shall multiply upon the earth," And Jeremiah 
the prophet has pointed out, that as many believers as God has prepared for this 
purpose, to multiply those left upon earth, should both be under the rule of the 
saints to minister to this Jerusalem, and that [His] kingdom shall be in it, 
saying, "Look around Jerusalem towards the east, and behold the joy which comes 
to thee from God Himself. Behold, thy sons shall come whom thou hast sent forth: 
they shall come in a band from the east even unto the west, by the word of that 
Holy One, rejoicing in that splendour which is from thy God. O Jerusalem, put 
off thy robe of mourning and of affliction, and put on that beauty of eternal 
splendour from thy God. Gird thyself with the double garment of that 
righteousness proceeding from thy God; place the mitre of eternal glory upon 
thine head. For God will show thy glory to the whole earth under heaven. For thy 
name shall for ever be called by God Himself, the peace of righteousness and 
glory to him that worships God. Arise, Jerusalem, stand on high, and look 
towards the east, and behold thy sons from the rising of the sun, even to the 
west, by the Word of that Holy One, rejoicing in the very remembrance of God. 
For the footmen have gone forth from thee, while they were drawn away by the 
enemy. God shall bring them in to thee, being borne with glory as the throne of 
a kingdom. For God has decreed that every high mountain shall be brought low, 
and the eternal hills, and that the valleys be filled, so that the surface of 
the earth be rendered smooth, that Israel, the glory of God, may walk in safety. 
The woods, too, shall make shady places, and every sweet-smelling tree shall be 
for Israel itself by the command of God. For God shall go before with joy in the 
light of His splendour, with the pity and righteousness which proceeds from 
Him."
2. Now all these things being such as they are, cannot be understood in 
reference to super-celestial matters; "for God," it is said, "will show to the 
whole earth that is under heaven thy glory." But in the times of the kingdom, 
the earth has been called again by Christ [to its pristine condition], and 
Jerusalem rebuilt after the pattern of the Jerusalem above, of which the prophet 
Isaiah says, "Behold, I have depicted thy walls upon my hands, and thou art 
always in my sight," 
And the apostle, too, writing to the Galatians, says in like manner, "But the 
Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all." 
He does not say this with any thought of an erratic Aeon, or of any other power 
which departed from the Pleroma, or of Prunicus, but of the Jerusalem which has 
been delineated on [God's] hands. And in the Apocalypse John saw this new 
[Jerusalem] descending upon the new earth. 
For after the times of the kingdom, he says, "I saw a great white throne, and 
Him who sat upon it, from whose face the earth fled away, and the heavens; and 
there was no more place for them." 
And he sets forth, too, the things connected with the general resurrection and 
the judgment, mentioning "the dead, great and small." "The sea," he says, "gave 
up the dead which it had in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead that 
they contained; and the books were opened. Moreover," he says, "the book of life 
was opened, and the dead were judged out of those things that were written in 
the books, according to their works; and death and hell were sent into the lake 
of fire, the second death." 
Now this is what is called Gehenna, which the Lord styled eternal fire. 
"And if any one," it is said, "was not found written in the book of life, he was 
sent into the lake of fire." 
And after this, he says, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first 
heaven and earth have passed away; also there was no more sea. And I saw the 
holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from heaven, as a bride adorned for her 
husband." "And I heard," it is said, "a great voice from the throne, saying, 
Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them; and they 
shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them as their God. And He 
will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more, neither 
sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, because the former 
things have passed away." 
Isaiah also declares the very same: "For there shall be a new heaven and a new 
earth; and there shall be no remembrance of the former, neither shall the heart 
think about them, but they shall find in it joy and exultation." 
Now this is what has been said by the apostle: "For the fashion of this world 
passeth away." 
To the same purpose did the Lord also declare, "Heaven and earth shall pass 
away." 
When these things, therefore, pass away above the earth, John, the Lord's 
disciple, says that the new Jerusalem above shall [then] descend, as a bride 
adorned for her husband; and that this is the tabernacle of God, in which God 
will dwell with men. Of this Jerusalem the former one is an image-that Jerusalem 
of the former earth in which the righteous are disciplined beforehand for 
incorruption and prepared for salvation. And of this tabernacle Moses received 
the pattern in the mount; 
and nothing is capable of being allegorized, but all things are stedfast, and 
true, land substantial, having been made by God for righteous men's enjoyment. 
For as it is God truly who raises up man, so also does man truly rise from the 
dead, and not allegorically, as I have shown repeatedly. And as he rises 
actually, so also shall he be actually disciplined beforehand for incorruption, 
and shall go forwards and flourish in the times of the kingdom, in order that he 
may be capable of receiving the glory of the Father. Then, when all things are 
made new, he shall truly dwell in the city of God. For it is said, "He that 
sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And the Lord says, 
Write all this; for these words are faithful and true. And He said to me, They 
are done." 
And this is the truth of the matter.

Chapter XXXVI.-Men Shall Be Actually 
  Raised: the World Shall Not Be Annihilated; But There Shall Be Various 
  Mansions for the Saints, According to the Rank Allotted to Each Individual. 
  All Things Shall Be Subject to God the Father, and So Shall He Be All in 
  All.
1. For since there are real men, so must there also be a real establishment 
(plantationem), that they vanish not away among non-existent things, but 
progress among those which have an actual existence. For neither is the 
substance nor the essence of the creation annihilated (for faithful and true is 
He who has established it), but "the fashion of the world passeth away; 
" 
that is, those things among which transgression has occurred, since man has 
grown old in them. And therefore this [present] fashion has been formed 
temporary, God foreknowing all things; as I have pointed out in the preceding 
book, 
and have also shown, as far as was possible, the cause of the creation of this 
world of temporal things. But when this [present] fashion [of things] passes 
away, and man has been renewed, and flourishes in an incorruptible state, so as 
to preclude the possibility of becoming old, [then] there shall be the new 
heaven and the new earth, in which the new man shall remain [continually ], 
always holding fresh converse with God. And since (or, that) these things 
shall ever continue without end, Isaiah declares, "For as the new heavens and 
the new earth which I do make, continue in my sight, saith the Lord, so shall 
your seed and your name remain." 
And as the presbyters say, Then those who are deemed worthy of an abode in 
heaven shall go there, others shall enjoy the delights of paradise, and others 
shall possess the splendour of the city; for everywhere the Saviour 
shall be seen according as they who see Him shall be worthy.
2. [They say, moreover], that there is this distinction between the 
habitation of those who produce an hundred-fold, and that of those who produce 
sixty-fold, and that of those who produce thirty-fold: for the first will be 
taken up into the heavens, the second will dwell in paradise, the last will 
inhabit the city; and that was on this account the Lord declared, "In My 
Father's house are many mansions." 
For all things belong to God, who supplies all with a suitable dwelling-place; 
even as His Word says, that a share is allotted to all by the Father, according 
as each person is or shall be worthy. And this is the couch on which the guests 
shall recline, having been invited to the wedding. 
The presbyters, the disciples of the apostles, affirm that this is the gradation 
and arrangement of those who are saved, and that they advance through steps of 
this nature; also that they ascend through the Spirit to the Son, and through 
the Son to the Father, and that in due time the Son will yield up His work to 
the Father, even as it is said by the apostle, "For He must reign till He hath 
put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is 
death." 
For in the times of the kingdom, the righteous man who is upon the earth shall 
then forget to die. "But when He saith, All things shall be subdued unto Him, it 
is manifest that He is excepted who did put all things under Him. And when all 
things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject 
unto Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all." 

3. John, therefore, did distinctly foresee the first "resurrection of the 
just," 
and the inheritance in the kingdom of the earth; and what the prophets have 
prophesied concerning it harmonize [with his vision]. For the Lord also taught 
these things, when He promised that He would have the mixed cup new with His 
disciples in the kingdom. The apostle, too, has confessed that the creation 
shall be free from the bondage of corruption, [so as to pass] into the liberty 
of the sons of God. 
And in all these things, and by them all, the same God the Father is manifested, 
who fashioned man, and gave promise of the inheritance of the earth to the 
fathers, who brought it (the creature) forth [from bondage] at the resurrection 
of the just, and fulfils the promises for the kingdom of His Son; subsequently 
bestowing in a paternal manner those things which neither the eye has seen, nor 
the ear has heard, nor has [thought concerning them] arisen within the heart of 
man, 
For there is the one Son, who accomplished His Father's will; and one human race 
also in which the mysteries of God are wrought, "which the angels desire to look 
into; " 
and they are not able to search out the wisdom of God, by means of Which His 
handiwork, confirmed and incorporated with His Son, is brought to perfection; 
that His offspring, the First-begotten Word, should descend to the creature 
(facturam), that is, to what had been moulded (plasma), and that 
it should be contained by Him; and, on the other hand, the creature should 
contain the Word, and ascend to Him, passing beyond the angels, and be made 
after the image and likeness of God.
