Ephesians. The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 

1:1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through 
the will of God, to the saints that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ 
Jesus: 1:2Grace to you and peace from God our 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 1:3Blessed be the God and Father of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the 
heavenly places in Christ: 1:4even as he chose us in him before the 
foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him 
in love: 1:5having foreordained us unto adoption as 
sons through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his 
will, 1:6to the praise of the glory of his grace, 
which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved: 1:7in whom we have our 
redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to 
the riches of his grace, 1:8which he made to abound toward us in all 
wisdom and prudence, 1:9making known unto us the mystery of his 
will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him 1:10unto a dispensation of the fulness of 
the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the 
things upon the earth; in him, I say, 1:11in whom also we 
were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him 
who worketh all things after the counsel of his will; 1:12to the end that we 
should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ: 1:13in 
whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your 
salvation,-- in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit 
of promise, 1:14which is an earnest of our inheritance, 
unto the redemption of God's own possession, unto the praise of his 
glory. 1:15For this cause I also, having heard of 
the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which ye 
show toward all the saints, 1:16cease not to give thanks for you, 
making mention of you in my prayers; 1:17that the God of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and 
revelation in the knowledge of him; 1:18having the eyes of your heart 
enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches 
of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, 1:19and what the 
exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that 
working of the strength of his might 1:20which he wrought in Christ, when he 
raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly 
places, 1:21far above all rule, and authority, and 
power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but 
also in that which is to come: 1:22and he put all things in subjection 
under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church, 1:23which is his body, the fulness of him 
that filleth all in all. 

2:1And you did he make alive, when 
ye were dead through your trespasses and sins, 2:2wherein ye once 
walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the 
powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience; 
2:3among whom we also all once lived in the 
lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by 
nature children of wrath, even as the rest:-- 2:4but God, being rich 
in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 2:5even when we were 
dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace have 
ye been saved), 2:6and raised us up with him, and made us 
to sit with him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus: 2:7that 
in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness 
toward us in Christ Jesus: 2:8for by grace have ye been saved through 
faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 2:9not 
of works, that no man should glory. 2:10For we are his workmanship, created in 
Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in 
them. 2:11Wherefore remember, that once ye, the 
Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called 
Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands; 2:12that ye were at 
that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and 
strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in 
the world. 2:13But now in Christ Jesus ye that once 
were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ. 2:14For he is our 
peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition, 2:15having abolished in the flesh the 
enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; that 
he might create in himself of the two one new man, so making peace; 2:16and might reconcile them both in one 
body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: 2:17and he came and preached peace to you 
that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh: 2:18for through him we 
both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father. 2:19So then ye are no 
more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and 
of the household of God, 2:20being built upon the foundation of the 
apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone; 2:21in 
whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in 
the Lord; 2:22in whom ye also are builded together 
for a habitation of God in the Spirit. 

3:1For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of 
Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,-- 3:2if so be that ye have heard of the 
dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward; 3:3how 
that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few 
words, 3:4whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive 
my understanding in the mystery of Christ; 3:5which in other 
generation was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed 
unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; 3:6to wit, that 
the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and 
fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, 3:7whereof I was made a minister, according 
to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of 
his power. 3:8Unto me, who am less than the least of 
all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable 
riches of Christ; 3:9and to make all men see what is the 
dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all 
things; 3:10to the intent that now unto the 
principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known 
through the church the manifold wisdom of God, 3:11according to the 
eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: 3:12in whom we have 
boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him. 3:13Wherefore I ask 
that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory. 3:14For this cause I bow my knees unto the 
Father, 3:15from whom every family in heaven and on 
earth is named, 3:16that he would grant you, according to 
the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his 
Spirit in the inward man; 3:17that Christ may dwell in your hearts 
through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 3:18may be strong to apprehend with all the 
saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 3:19and to know the 
love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the 
fulness of God. 3:20Now unto him that is able to do 
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that 
worketh in us, 3:21unto him be the glory in the 
church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen. 


4:1I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, 
beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called, 4:2with 
all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; 
4:3giving diligence to keep the unity of 
the Spirit in the bond of peace. 4:4There is one body, and one 
Spirit, even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling; 4:5one 
Lord, one faith, one baptism, 4:6one God and Father of all, who is over 
all, and through all, and in all. 4:7But unto each one of us was the grace 
given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 4:8Wherefore he saith, 
When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, And gave gifts unto men. 4:9(Now 
this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of 
the earth? 4:10He that descended is the same also that 
ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.) 4:11And he gave some to be apostles; 
and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 4:12for the perfecting of the saints, unto 
the work of ministering, unto the building up of the body of Christ: 4:13till we all attain unto the unity of 
the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a fullgrown man, unto 
the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 4:14that we may be no 
longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of 
doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error; 4:15but speaking truth in love, we may grow 
up in all things into him, who is the head, even Christ; 4:16from whom all the body fitly framed and 
knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working 
in due measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto 
the building up of itself in love. 4:17This I say therefore, and testify in 
the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of 
their mind, 4:18being darkened in their understanding, 
alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, 
because of the hardening of their heart; 4:19who being past feeling gave themselves 
up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. 4:20But ye did not so learn Christ; 4:21if 
so be that ye heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus: 4:22that ye put away, as concerning your 
former manner of life, the old man, that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of 
deceit; 4:23and that ye be renewed in the spirit of 
your mind, 4:24and put on the new man, that after God 
hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth. 4:25Wherefore, putting 
away falsehood, speak ye truth each one with his neighbor: for we are members 
one of another. 4:26Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the 
sun go down upon your wrath: 4:27neither give place to the devil. 4:28Let him that stole steal no more: but 
rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may 
have whereof to give to him that hath need. 4:29Let no corrupt 
speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need 
may be, that it may give grace to them that hear. 4:30And grieve not the 
Holy Spirit of God, in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption. 4:31Let all bitterness, and wrath, and 
anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you, with all malice: 4:32and be ye kind one to another, 
tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you. 


5:1Be ye therefore imitators of God, as 
beloved children; 5:2and walk in love, even as Christ also 
loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an 
odor of a sweet smell. 5:3But fornication, and all uncleanness, or 
covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints; 5:4nor 
filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather 
giving of thanks. 5:5For this ye know of a surety, that no 
fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any 
inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 5:6Let no man deceive 
you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon 
the sons of disobedience. 5:7Be not ye therefore partakers with them; 
5:8For ye were once darkness, but are now 
light in the Lord: walk as children of light 5:9(for the fruit of 
the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 5:10proving what is 
well-pleasing unto the Lord; 5:11and have no fellowship with the 
unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them; 5:12for the things 
which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of. 5:13But all things when they are reproved 
are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light. 
5:14Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou 
that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee. 5:15Look therefore carefully how ye walk, 
not as unwise, but as wise; 5:16redeeming the time, because the days 
are evil. 5:17Wherefore be ye not foolish, but 
understand what the will of the Lord is. 5:18And be not drunken with wine, wherein 
is riot, but be filled with the Spirit; 5:19speaking one to another in psalms and 
hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the 
Lord; 5:20giving thanks always for all things in 
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; 5:21subjecting 
yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ. 5:22Wives, be in 
subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. 5:23For the husband is 
the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the church, being 
himself the saviour of the body. 5:24But as the church is subject to Christ, 
so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything. 5:25Husbands, love your wives, even as 
Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it; 5:26that he might 
sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, 5:27that he might present the church to 
himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; 
but that it should be holy and without blemish. 5:28Even so ought 
husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his 
own wife loveth himself: 5:29for no man ever hated his own flesh; 
but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church; 5:30because we are members of his body. 5:31For this cause shall a man leave his 
father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one 
flesh. 5:32This mystery is great: but I speak in 
regard of Christ and of the church. 5:33Nevertheless do ye also severally love 
each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that 
she fear her husband. 

6:1Children, obey your parents in the Lord: 
for this is right. 6:2Honor thy father and mother (which is 
the first commandment with promise), 6:3that it may be well with thee, and thou 
mayest live long on the earth. 6:4And, ye fathers, provoke not your 
children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the 
Lord. 6:5Servants, be obedient unto them that 
according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness 
of your heart, as unto Christ; 6:6not in the way of eyeservice, as 
men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 
6:7with good will doing service, as unto 
the Lord, and not unto men: 6:8knowing that whatsoever good thing each 
one doeth, the same shall he receive again from the Lord, whether he be 
bond or free. 6:9And, ye masters, do the same things unto 
them, and forbear threatening: knowing that he who is both their Master and 
yours is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him. 6:10Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in 
the strength of his might. 6:11Put on the whole armor of God, that ye 
may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 6:12For our wrestling 
is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the 
powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual 
hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. 6:13Wherefore take up 
the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, 
having done all, to stand. 6:14Stand therefore, having girded your 
loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 6:15and having shod your feet with the 
preparation of the gospel of peace; 6:16withal taking up the shield of faith, 
wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one. 
6:17And take the helmet of salvation, and 
the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: 6:18with all prayer and 
supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all 
perseverance and supplication for all the saints, 6:19And on my behalf, 
that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth, to make known with 
boldness the mystery of the gospel, 6:20for which I am an ambassador in chains; 
that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. 6:21But that ye also 
may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful 
minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: 6:22whom I have sent 
unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may 
comfort your hearts. 6:23Peace be to the brethren, and love with 
faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 6:24Grace be with all 
them that love our Lord Jesus Christ with a love incorruptible.
