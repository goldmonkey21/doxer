Tatian's Address to the Greeks












TATIAN'S ADDRESS TO THE GREEKS. 
[TRANSLATED BY J. E. RYLAND.] 
CHAP. I.--THE GREEKS CLAIM, WITHOUT REASON, THE INVENTION OF THE ARTS. 
BE not, O Greeks, so very hostilely disposed towards the Barbarians, nor look 
with ill will on their opinions. For which of your institutions has not been 
derived from the Barbarians? The most eminent of the Telmessians invented the 
art of divining by dreams; the Carians, that of prognosticating by the stars; 
the Phrygians and the most ancient Isaurians, augury by the flight of birds; the 
Cyprians, the art of inspecting victims. To the Babylonians you owe astronomy; 
to the Persians, magic; to the Egyptians, geometry; to the Phoenicians, 
instruction by alphabetic writing. Cease, then, to miscall these imitations 
inventions of your own. Orpheus, again, taught you poetry and song; from him, 
too, you learned the mysteries. The Tuscans taught you the plastic art; from the 
annals of the Egyptians you learned to write history; you acquired the art of 
playing the flute from Marsyas and Olympus,--these two rustic Phrygians 
constructed the harmony of the shepherd's pipe. The Tyrrhenians invented the 
trumpet; the Cyclopes, the smith's art; and a woman who was formerly a queen of 
the Persians, as Hellanicus tells us, the method of joining together epistolary 
tablets:, her name was Atossa. Wherefore lay aside this conceit, and be not ever 
boasting of your elegance of diction; for, while you applaud yourselves, your 
own people will of course side with you. But it becomes a man of sense to wait 
for the testimony of others, and it becomes men to be of one accord also in the 
pronunciation of their language. But, as matters stand, to you alone it has 
happened not to speak alike even in common intercourse; for the way of speaking 
among the Dorians is not the same as that of the inhabitants of Attica, nor do 
the AEolians speak like the Ionians. And, since such a discrepancy exists where 
it ought not to be, I am at a loss whom to call a Greek. And, what is strangest 
of all, you hold in honour expressions not of native growth, and by the 
intermixture of barbaric words have made your language a medley. On this account 
we have renounced your wisdom, though I was once a great proficient in it; for, 
as the comic poet says,- These are gleaners' grapes and small talk,- Twittering 
places of swallows, corrupters of art. 
Yet those who eagerly pursue it shout lustily, and croak like so many ravens. 
You have, too, contrived the art of rhetoric to serve injustice and slander, 
selling the free power of your speech for hire, and often representing the same 
thing at one time as right, at another time as not good. The poetic art, again, 
you employ to describe battles, and the amours of the gods, and the corruption 
of the soul. 
CHAP. II.--THE VICES AND ERRORS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS. 
What noble thing have you produced by your pursuit of philosophy? Who of your 
most eminent men has been free from vain boasting? Diogenes, who made such a 
parade of his independence with his tub, was seized with a bowel complaint 
through eating a raw polypus, and so lost his life by gluttony. Aristippus, 
walking about in a purple robe, led a profligate life, in accordance with his 
professed opinions. Plato, a philosopher, was sold by Dionysius for his 
gormandizing propensities. And Aristotle, who absurdly placed a limit to 
Providence and made happiness to consist in the things which give pleasure, 
quite contrary to his duty as a preceptor flattered Alexander, forgetful that he 
was but a youth; and he, showing how well he had learned the lessons of his 
master, because his friend would not worship him shut him up and and carried him 
about like a bear or a leopard He in fact obeyed strictly the precepts of his 
teacher in displaying manliness and courage by feasting, and transfixing with 
his spear his intimate and most beloved friend, and then, under a semblance of 
grief, weeping and starving himself, that he might not incur the hatred of his 
friends. I could laugh at those also who in the present day adhere to his 
tenets,--people who say that sublunary things are not under the care of 
Providence; and so, being nearer the earth than the moon, and below its orbit, 
they themselves look after what is thus left uncared for; and as for those who 
have neither beauty, nor wealth, nor bodily strength, nor high birth, they have 
no happiness, according to Aristotle. Let such men philosophize, for me! 
CHAP. III.--RIDICULE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS. 
I cannot approve of Heraclitus, who, being self-taught and arrogant, said, "I 
have explored myself." Nor can I praise him for hiding his poem in the temple of 
Artemis, in order that it might be published afterwards as a mystery; and those 
who take an interest in such things say that Euripides the tragic poet came 
there and read it, and, gradually learning it by heart, carefully handed down to 
posterity this darkness of Heraclitus. Death, however, demonstrated the 
stupidity of this man; for, being attacked by dropsy, as he had studied the art 
of medicine as well as philosophy, he plastered himself with cow-dung, which, as 
it hardened, contracted the flesh of his whole body, so that he was pulled in 
pieces, and thus died. Then, one cannot listen to Zeno, who declares that at the 
conflagration the same man will rise again to perform the same actions as 
before; for instance, Anytus and Miletus to accuse, Busiris to murder his 
guests, and Hercules to repeat his labours; and in this doctrine of the 
conflagration he introduces more wicked than just persons--one Socrates and a 
Hercules, and a few more of the same class, but not many, for the bad will be 
found far more numerous than the good. And according to him the Deity will 
manifestly be the author of evil, dwelling in sewers and worms, and in the 
perpetrators of impiety. The eruptions of fire in Sicily, moreover, confute the 
empty boasting of Empedocles, in that, though he was no god, he falsely almost 
gave himself out for one. I laugh, too, at the old wife's talk of Pherecydes, 
and the doctrine inherited from him by Pythagoras, and that of Plato, an 
imitation of his, though some think otherwise. And who would give his approval 
to the cynogamy of Crates, and not rather, repudiating the wild and tumid speech 
of those who resemble him, turn to the investigation of what truly deserves 
attention? 
Wherefore be not led away by the solemn assemblies of philosophers who are no 
philosophers, who dogmatize one against the other, though each one vents but the 
crude fancies of the moment. They have, moreover, many collisions among 
themselves; each one hates the other; they indulge in conflicting opinions, and 
their arrogance makes them eager for the highest places. It would better become 
them, moreover, not to pay court to kings unbidden, nor to flatter men at the 
head of affairs, but to wait till the great ones come to them. 
CHAP. IV.--THE CHRISTIANS WORSHIP GOD ALONE. 
For what reason, men of Greece, do you wish to bring the civil powers, as in 
a pugilistic encounter, into collision with us? And, if I am not disposed to 
comply with the usages of some of them, why am I to be abhorred as a vile 
miscreant? Does the sovereign order the payment of tribute, I am ready to render 
it. Does my master command me to act as a bondsman and to serve, I acknowledge 
the serfdom. Man is to be honoured as a fellow-man; God alone is to be 
feared,--He who is not visible to human eyes, nor comes within the compass of 
human art. Only when I am commanded to deny Him, will I not obey, but will 
rather die than show myself false and ungrateful. Our God did not begin to be in 
time: He alone is without beginning, and He Himself is the beginning of all 
things. God is a Spirit, not pervading matter, but the Maker of material 
spirits, and of the forms that are in matter; He is invisible, impalpable, being 
Himself the Father of both sensible and invisible things. Him we know from His 
creation, and apprehend His invisible power by His works. I refuse to adore that 
workman ship which He has made for our sakes. The sun and moon were made for us: 
how, then, can I adore my own servants? How can I speak of stocks and stones as 
gods? For the Spirit that pervades matter is inferior to the more divine spirit; 
and this, even when assimilated to the soul, is not to be honoured equally with 
the perfect God. Nor even ought the ineffable God to be presented with gifts; 
for He who is in want of nothing is not to be misrepresented by us as though He 
were indigent.But I will set forth our views more distinctly. 
CHAP. v.--THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIANS AS TO THE CREATION OF THE WORLD. 
God was in the beginning; but the beginning, we have been taught, is the 
power of the Logos. For the Lord of the universe, who is Himself the necessary 
ground (npostasis) of all being, inasmuch as no creature was yet in 
existence, was alone; but inasmuch as He was all power, Himself the necessary 
ground of things visible and invisible, with Him were all things; with Him, by 
Logos-power (dia lpgikhs dunameps), the Logos Himself also, 
who was in Him, subsists. And by His simple will the Logos springs forth; and 
the Logos, not coming forth in vain, becomes the first-begotten work of the 
Father. Him (the Logos) we know to be the beginning of the world. But He came 
into being by participation, not by abscission; for what is cut off is separated 
from the original substance, but that which comes by participation, making its 
choice of function, does not render him deficient from whom it is taken. For 
just as from one torch many fires are lighted, but the light of the first torch 
is not lessened by the kindling of many torches, so the Logos, coming forth from 
the Logos-power of the Father, has not divested of the Logos-power Him who begat 
Him. I myself, for instance, talk, and you hear; yet, certainly, I who converse 
do not become destitute of speech (logos) by the transmission of speech, 
but by the utterance of my voice I endeavour to reduce to order the unarranged 
matter in your minds. And as the Logos begotten in the beginning, begat in turn 
our world, having first created for Himself the necessary matter, so also I, in 
imitation of the Logos, being begotten again, and having become possessed of the 
truth, am trying to reduce to order the confused matter which is kindred with 
myself. For matter iS not, like God, without beginning, nor, as having no 
beginning, is of equal power with God; it is begotten, and not produced by any 
other being, but brought into existence by the Framer of all things alone. 
CHAP. VI.--CHRISTIANS' BELIEF IN THE RESURRECTION. 
And on this account we believe that there will be a resurrection of bodies 
after the consummation of all things; not, as the Stoics affirm, according to 
the return of certain cycles, the same things being produced and destroyed for 
no useful purpose, but a resurrection once for all, when our periods of 
existence are completed, and in consequence solely of the constitution of things 
under which men alone live, for the purpose of passing judgment upon them. Nor 
is sentence upon us passed by Minos or Rhadamanthus, before whose decease not a 
single soul, according to the mythic tales, was judged; but the Creator, God 
Himself, becomes the arbiter. And, although you regard us as mere triflers and 
babblers, it troubles us not, since we have faith in this doctrine. For just as, 
not existing before I was born, I knew not who I was, and only existed in the 
potentiality (upostasis) Of fleshly matter, but being born, after a 
former state of nothingness, I have obtained through my birth a certainty of my 
existence; in the same way, having been born, and through death existing no 
longer, and seen no longer, I shall exist again, just as before I was not, but 
was afterwards born. Even though fire destroy all traces of my flesh, the world 
receives the vaporized matter; and though dispersed through rivers and seas, or 
torn in pieces by wild beasts, I am laid up in the storehouses of a wealthy 
Lord. And, although the poor and the godless know not what is stored up, yet God 
the Sovereign, when He pleases, will restore the substance that is visible to 
Him alone to its pristine condition. 
CHAP. VII.--CONCERNING THE FALL OF MAN. 
For the heavenly Logos, a spirit emanating from the Father and a Logos from 
the Logos-power, in imitation of the Father who begat Him made man an image of 
immortality, so that, as incorruption is with God, in like manner, man, sharing 
in a part of God, might have the immortal principle also. The Logos, too, before 
the creation of men, was the Framer of angels. And each of these two orders of 
creatures was made free to act as it pleased, not having the nature of good, 
which again is with God alone, but is brought to perfection in men through their 
freedom of choice, in order that the bad man may be justly punished, having 
become depraved through his own fault, but the just man be deservedly praised 
for his virtuous deeds, since in the exercise of his free choice he refrained 
from transgressing the will of God. Such is the constitution of things in 
reference to angels and men. And the power of the Logos, having in itself a 
faculty to foresee future events, not as fated, but as taking place by the 
choice of free agents, foretold from time to time the issues of things to come; 
it also became a forbidder of wickedness by means of prohibitions, and the 
encomiast of those who remained good. And, when men attached themselves to one 
who was more subtle than the rest, having regard to his being the first-born, 
and declared him to be God, though he was resisting' the law of God, then the 
power of the Logos excluded the beginner of the folly and his adherents from all 
fellowship with Himself. And so he who was made in the likeness of God, since 
the more powerful spirit is separated from him, becomes mortal; but that 
first-begotten one through his transgression and ignorance becomes a demon; and 
they who imitated him, that is his illusions, are become a host of demons, and 
through their freedom of choice have been given up to their own infatuation. 
CHAP. VIII.--THE DEMONS SIN AMONG MANKIND. 
But men form the material (upoqesis) of their apostasy. For, having 
shown them a plan of the position of the stars, like dice-players, they 
introduced Fate, a flagrant injustice. For the judge and the judged are made so 
by Fate; the murderers and the murdered, the wealthy and the needy, are the 
offspring of the same Fate; and every nativity is regarded as a theatrical 
entertainment by those beings of whom Homer says,- "Among the gods Rose laughter 
irrepressible." 
But must not those who are spectators of single combats and are partisans on 
one side or the other, and he who marries and is a paederast and an adulterer, 
who laughs and is angry, who flees and is wounded, be regarded as mortals? For, 
by whatever actions they manifest to men their characters, by these they prompt 
their hearers to copy their example. And are not the demons themselves, with 
Zeus at their head, subjected to Fate, being overpowered by the same passions as 
men? And, besides, how are those beings to be worshipped among whom there exists 
such a great contrariety of opinions? For Rhea, whom the inhabitants of the 
Phrygian mountains call Cybele, enacted emasculation on account of Attis, of 
whom she was enamoured; but Aphrodite is delighted with conjugal embraces. 
Artemis is a poisoner; Apollo heals diseases. And after the decapitation of the 
Gorgon, the beloved of Poseidon, whence sprang the horse Pegasus and Chrysaor, 
Athene and Asclepios divided between them the drops of blood; and, while he 
saved men's lives by means of them, she, by the same blood, became a homicide 
and the instigator of wars. From regard to her reputation, as it appears to me, 
the Athenians attributed to the earth the son born of her connection with 
Hephaestos, that Athene might not be thought to be deprived of her virility by 
Hephaestos, as Atalanta by Meleaget. This limping manufacturer of buckles and 
earrings, as is likely, deceived the motherless child and orphan with these 
girlish ornaments. Poseidon frequents the seas; Ares delights in wars; Apollo is 
a player on the cithara; Dionysus is absolute sovereign of the Thebans; Kronos 
is a tyrannicide; Zeus has intercourse with his own daughter, who becomes 
pregant by him. I may instance, too, Eleusis, and the mystic Dragon, and 
Orpheus, who says,- "Close the gates against the profane!" Aidoneus carries off 
Kore, and his deeds have been made into mysteries; Demeter bewails her daughter, 
and some persons are deceived by the Athenians. In the precincts of the temple 
of the son of Leto is a spot called Omphalos; but Omphalos is the burial-place 
of Dionysus. You now I laud, O Daphne!--by conquering the incontinence of 
Apollo, you disproved his power of vaticination; for, not foreseeing what would 
occur to you, he derived no advantage from his art. Let the far-shooting god 
tell me how Zephyrus slew Hyacinthus. Zephyrus conquered him; and in accordance 
with the saying of the tragic poet,- "Abreeze is the most honourable chariot of 
the gods," -- conquered by a slight breeze, Apollo lost his beloved. 
CHAP. IX.--THEY GIVE RISE TO SUPERSTITIONS. 
Such are the demons; these are they who laid down the doctrine of Fate. Their 
fundamental principle was the placing of animals in the heavens. For the 
creeping things on the earth, and those that swim in the waters, and the 
quadrupeds on the mountains, with which they lived when expelled from 
heaven,--these they dignified with celestial honour, in order that they might 
themselves be thought to remain in heaven, and, by placing the constellations 
there, might make to appear rational the irrational course of life on earth. 
Thus the high-spirited and he who is crushed with toil, the temperate and the 
intemperate, the indigent and the wealthy, are what they are simply from the 
controllers of their nativity. For the delineation of the zodiacal circle is the 
work of gods. And, when the light of one of them predominates, as they express 
it, it deprives all the rest of their honour; and he who now is conquered, at 
another time gains the predominance. And the seven planets are well pleased with 
them, as if they were amusing themselves with dice. But we are superior to Fate, 
and instead of wandering (planhtwn) demons, we have learned to know one 
Lord who wanders not; and, as we do not follow the guidance of Fate, we reject 
its lawgivers. Tell me, I adjure you did Triptolemus sow wheat and prove a 
benefactor to the Athenians after their sorrow? And why was not Demeter, before 
she lost her daughter, a benefactress to men? The Dog of Erigone is shown in the 
heavens, and the Scorpion the helper of Artemis, and Chiron the Centaur, and the 
divided Argo, and the Bear of Callisto. Yet how, before these performed the 
aforesaid deeds, were the heavens unadorned? And to whom will it not appear 
ridiculous that the Deltotum should be placed among the stars, according to 
some, on account of Sicily, or, as others say, on account of the first letter in 
the name of Zeus (Dios)? For why are not Sardinia and Cyprus honoured in 
heaven? And why have not the letters of the names of the brothers of Zeus, who 
shared the kingdom with him, been fixed there too? And how is it that Kronos, 
who was put in chains and ejected from his kingdom, is constituted a manager of 
Fate? How, too, can he give kingdoms who no longer reigns himself? Reject, then, 
these absurdities, and do not become transgressors by hating us unjustly. 
CHAP. X.--RIDICULE OF THE HEATHEN DIVINITIES. 
There are legends of the metamorphosis of men: with you the gods also are 
metamorphosed. Rhea becomes a tree; Zeus a dragon, on account of Persephone; the 
sisters of Phaethon are changed into poplars, and Leto into a bird of little 
value, on whose account what is now Delos was called Ortygia. A god, forsooth, 
becomes a swan, or takes the form of an eagle, and, making Ganymede his 
cupbearer, glories in a vile affection. How can I reverence gods who are eager 
for presents, and angry if they do not receive them? Let them have their Fate! I 
am not willing to adore wandering stars. What is that hair of Berenice? Where 
were her stars before her death? And how was the dead Antinous fixed as a 
beautiful youth in the moon? Who carried him thither: unless perchance, as men, 
perjuring themselves for hire, are credited when they say in ridicule of the 
gods that kings have ascended into heaven, so some one, in like manner, has put 
this man also among the gods, and been recompensed with honour and reward? Why 
have you robbed God? Why do you dishonour His workmanship? You sacrifice a 
sheep, and you adore the same animal. The Bull is in the heavens, and you 
slaughter its image. The Kneeler crushes a noxious animal; and the eagle that 
devours the man-maker Prometheus is honoured. The swan is noble, forsooth, 
because it was an adulterer; and the Dioscuri, living on alternate days, the 
ravishers of the daughters of Leucippus, are also noble! Better still is Helen, 
who forsook the flaxen-haired Menelaus, and followed the turbaned and 
gold-adorned Paris. A just man also is Sophron, who transported this adulteress 
to the Elysian fields! But even the daughter of Tyndarus is not gifted with 
immortality, and Euripides has wisely represented this woman as put to death by 
Orestes. 
CHAP. XI.--THE SIN OF MEN DUE NOT TO FATE, BUT TO FREE-WILL 
How, then, shall I admit this nativity according to Fate, when I see such 
managers of Fate? I do not wish to be a king; I am not anxious to be rich; I 
decline military command; I detest fornication; I am not impelled by an 
insatiable love of gain to go to sea; I do not contend for chaplets; I am free 
from a mad thirst for fame; I despise death; I am superior to every kind of 
disease; grief does not consume my soul. Am I a slave, I endure servitude. Am I 
free, I do not make a vaunt of my good birth. I see that the same sun is for 
all, and one death for all, whether they live in pleasure or destitution. The 
rich man sows, and the poor man partakes of the same sowing. The wealthiest die, 
and beggars have the same limits to their life. The rich lack many things, and 
are glorious only through the estimation they are held in; but the poor man and 
he who has very moderate desires, seeking as he does only the things suited to 
his lot, more easily obtains his purpose. How is it that you are fated to be 
sleepless through avarice? Why are you fated to grasp at things often, and often 
to die? Die to the world, repudiating the madness that is in it. Live to God, 
and by apprehending Him lay aside your old nature. We were not created to die, 
but we die by our own fault. Our free-will has destroyed us; we who were free 
have become slaves; we have been sold through sin. Nothing evil has been created 
by God; we Ourselves have manifested wickedness; but we, who have manifested it, 
are able again to reject it. 
CHAP. XII.--THE TWO KINDS OF SPIRITS. 
We recognise two varieties of spirit, one of which is called the soul 
(yukh), but the other is greater than the soul, an image and likeness of 
God: both existed in the first men, that in one sense they might be material 
(ulikoi), and in another superior to matter. The case stands thus: we can 
see that the whole structure of the world, and the whole creation, has been 
produced from matter, and the matter itself brought into existence by God; so 
that on the one hand it may be regarded as rude and unformed before it was 
separated into parts, and on the other as arranged in beauty and order after the 
separation was made. Therefore in that separation the heavens were made of 
matter, and the stars that are in them; and the earth and all that is upon it 
has a similar constitution: so that there is a common origin of all things. But, 
while such is the case, there yet are certain differences in the things made of 
matter, so that one is more beautiful, and another is beautiful but surpassed by 
something better. For as the constitution of the body is under one management, 
and is engaged in doing that which is the cause of its having been made, yet 
though this is the case, there are certain differences of dignity in it, and the 
eye is one thing, and another the ear, and another the arrangement of the hair 
and the distribution of the intestines, and the compacting together of the 
marrow and the bones and the tendons; and though one part differs from another, 
there is yet all the harmony of a concert of music in their arrangement;--in 
like manner the world, according to the power of its Maker containing some 
things of superior splendour, but some unlike these, received by the will of the 
Creator a material spirit. And these things severally it is possible for him to 
perceive who does not conceitedly reject those most divine explanations which in 
the course of time have been consigned to writing, and make those who study them 
great lovers of God. Therefore the demons, as you call them, having received 
their structure from matter and obtained the spirit which inheres in it, became 
intemperate and greedy; some few, indeed, turning to what was purer, but others 
choosing what was inferior in matter, and conforming their manner of life to it. 
These beings, produced from matter, but very remote from right conduct, you, O 
Greeks, worship. For, being turned by their own folly to vaingloriousness, and 
shaking off the reins [of authority], they have been forward to become robbers 
of Deity; and the Lord of all has suffered them to besport themselves, till the 
world, coming to an end, be dissolved, and the Judge appear, and all those men 
who, while assailed by the demons, strive after the knowledge of the perfect God 
obtain as the result of their conflicts a more perfect testimony in the day of 
judgment. There is, then, a spirit in the stars, a spirit in angels, a spirit in 
plants and the waters, a spirit in men, a spirit in animals; but, though one and 
the same, it has differences in itself. And while we say these things not from 
mere hearsay, nor from probable conjectures and sophistical reasoning, but using 
words of a certain diviner speech, do you who are willing hasten to learn. And 
you who do not reject with contempt the Scythian Anacharsis, do not disdain to 
be taught by those who follow a barbaric code of laws. Give at least as 
favourable a reception to our tenets as you would to the prognostications of the 
Babylonians. Hearken to us when we speak, if only as you would to an oracular 
oak. And yet the things just referred to are the trickeries of frenzied demons, 
while the doctrines we inculcate are far beyond the apprehension of the world. 
CHAP. XIII.--THEORY OF THE SOUL'S IMMORTALITY. 
The soul is not in itself immortal, O Greeks, but mortal. Yet it is possible 
for it not to die. If, indeed, it knows not the truth, it dies, and is dissolved 
with the body, but rises again at last at the end of the world with the body, 
receiving death by punishment in immortality. But, again, if it acquires the 
knowledge of God, it dies not, although for a time it be dissolved. In itself it 
is darkness, and there is nothing luminous in it. And this is the meaning of the 
saying, "The darkness comprehendeth not the light." For the soul does not 
preserve the spirit, but is preserved by it, and the light comprehends the 
darkness. The Logos, in truth, is the light of God, but the ignorant soul is 
darkness. On this account, if it continues solitary, it tends downward towards 
matter, and dies with the flesh; but, if it enters into union with the Divine 
Spirit, it is no longer helpless, but ascends to the regions whither the Spirit 
guides it: for the dwelling-place of the spirit is above, but the origin of the 
soul is from beneath. Now, in the beginning the spirit was a constant companion 
of the soul, but the spirit forsook it because it was not willing to follow. 
Yet, retaining as it were a spark of its power, though unable by reason of the 
separation to discern the perfect, while seeking for God it fashioned to itself 
in its wandering many gods, following the sophistries of the demons. 
But the Spirit of God is not with all, but, taking up its abode with those 
who live justly, and intimately combining with the soul, by prophecies it 
announced hidden things to other souls. And the souls that are obedient to 
wisdom have attracted to themselves the cognate spirit; but the disobedient, 
rejecting the minister of the suffering God, have shown themselves to be 
fighters against God, rather than His worshippers. 
CHAP. XIV.--THE DEMONS SHALL BE PUNISHED MORE SEVERELY THAN MEN. 
And such are you also, O Greeks,--profuse in words, but with minds strangely 
warped; and you acknowledge the dominion of many rather than the rule of one, 
accustoming yourselves to follow demons as if they were mighty. For, as the 
inhuman robber is wont to overpower those like himself by daring; so the demons, 
going to great lengths in wickedness, have utterly deceived the souls among you 
which are left to themselves by ignorance and false appearances. These! beings 
do not indeed die easily, for they do not partake of flesh; but while living 
they practise the ways of death, and die themselves as often as they teach their 
followers to sin. Therefore, what is now their chief distinction, that they do 
not die like men, they will retain when about to suffer punishment: they will 
not partake of everlasting life, so as to receive this instead of death in a 
blessed immortality. And as we, to whom it now easily happens to die, afterwards 
receive the immortal with enjoyment, or the painful with immortality, so the 
demons, who abuse the present life to purposes of wrong-doing, dying continually 
even while they live, will have hereafter the same immortality, like that which 
they had during the time they lived, but in its nature like that of men, who 
voluntarily performed what the demons prescribed to them during their lifetime. 
And do not fewer kinds of sin break out among men owing to the brevity of their 
lives, while on the part of these demons transgression is more abundant owing to 
their boundless existence? 
CHAP. XV.--NECESSITY OF A UNION WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. 
But further, it becomes us now to seek for what we once had, but have lost, 
to unite the soul with the Holy Spirit, and to strive after union with God. The 
human soul consists of many parts, and is not simple; it is composite, so as to 
manifest itself through the body; for neither could it ever appear by itself 
without the body, nor does the flesh rise again without the soul. Man is not, as 
the croaking philosophers say, merely a rational animal, capable of 
understanding and knowledge; for, according to them, even irrational creatures 
appear possessed of understanding and knowledge. But man alone is the image and 
likeness of God; and I mean by man, not one who performs actions similar to 
those of animals, but one who has advanced far beyond mere humanity--to God 
Himself. This question we have discussed more minutely in the treatise 
concerning animals. But the principal point to be spoken of now is, what is 
intended by the image and likeness of God. That which cannot be compared is no 
other than abstract being; but that which is compared is no other than that 
which is like. The perfect God is without flesh; but man is flesh. The bond of 
the flesh is the soul; that which encloses the soul is the flesh. Such is the 
nature of man's constitution; and, if it be like a temple, God is pleased to 
dwell in it by the spirit, His representative; but, if it be not such a 
habitation, man excels the wild beasts in articulate language only,--in other 
respects his manner of life is like theirs, as one who is not a likeness of God. 
But none of the demons possess flesh; their structure is spiritual, like that of 
fire or air. And only by those whom the Spirit of God dwells in and fortifies 
are the bodies of the demons easily seen, not at all by others,--I mean those 
who possess only soul; for the inferior has not the ability to apprehend the 
superior. On this account the nature of the demons has no place for repentance; 
for they are the reflection of matter and of wickedness. But matter desired to 
exercise lordship over the soul; and according to their free-will these gave 
laws of death to men; but men, after the loss of immortality, have conquered 
death by submitting to death in faith; and by repentance a call has been given 
to them, according to the word which says, "Since they were made a little lower 
than the angels." And, for every one who has been conquered, it is possible 
again to conquer, if he rejects the condition which brings death. And what that 
is, may be easily seen by men who long for immortality. 
CHAP. XVI.--VAIN DISPLAY OF POWER BY THE DEMONS. 
But the demons who rule over men are not the souls of men; for how should 
these be capable of action after death? unless man, who while living was void of 
understanding and power, should be believed when dead to be endowed with more of 
active power. But neither could this be the case, as we have shown elsewhere. 
And it is difficult to conceive that the immortal soul, which is impeded by the 
members of the body, should become more intelligent when it has migrated from 
it. For the demons, inspired with frenzy against men by reason of their own 
wickedness, pervert their minds, which already incline downwards, by various 
deceptive scenic representations, that they may be disabled from rising to the 
path that leads to heaven. But from us the things which are in the world are not 
hidden, and the divine is easily apprehended by us if the power that makes souls 
immortal visits us. The demons are seen also by the men possessed of soul, when, 
as sometimes, they exhibit themselves to men, either that they may be thought to 
be something, or as evil-disposed friends may do harm to them as to enemies, or 
afford occasions of doing them honour to those who resemble them. For, if it 
were possible, they would without doubt pull down heaven itself with the rest of 
creation. 
But now this they can by no means effect, for they have not the power; but 
they make war by means of the lower matter against the matter that is like 
themselves. Should any one wish to conquer them, let him repudiate matter. 
Being armed with the breastplate of the celestial Spirit, he will be able to 
preserve all that is encompassed by it. There are, indeed, diseases and 
disturbances of the matter that is in us; but, when such things happen, the 
demons ascribe the causes of them tO themselves, and approach a man whenever 
disease lays hold of him. Sometimes they themselves disturb the habit of the 
body by a tempest of folly; but, being smitten by the word of God, they depart 
in terror, and the sick man is healed. 
CHAP. XVII.--THEY FALSELY PROMISE HEALTH TO THEIR VOTARIES. 
Concerning the sympathies and antipathies of Democritus what can we say but 
this, that, according to the common saying, the man of Abdera is Abderiloquent? 
But, as he who gave the name to the city, a friend of Hercules as it is said, 
was devoured by the horses of Diomedes, so he who boasted of the Magian Ostanes 
will be delivered up in the day of consummation s as fuel for the eternal fire. 
And you, if you do not cease from your laughter, will gain the same punishment 
as the jugglers. Wherefore, O Greeks, hearken to me, addressing you as from an 
eminence, nor in mockery transfer your own want of reason to the herald of the 
truth. A diseased affection (paqos) is not destroyed by a 
counter-affection (antipaqeia), nor is a maniac cured by hanging little 
amulets of leather upon him. There are visitations of demons; and he who is 
sick, and he who says he is in love, and he who hates, and he who wishes to be 
revenged, accept them as helpers. And this is the method of their operation: 
just as the forms of alphabetic letters and the lines composed of them cannot of 
themselves indicate what is meant, but men have invented for themselves signs of 
their thoughts, knowing by their peculiar combination what the order of the 
letters was intended to express; so, in like manner, the various kinds of roots 
and the mutual relation of the sinews and bones can effect nothing of 
themselves, but are the elemental matter with which the depravity of the demons 
works, who have determined for what purpose each of them is available. 
And, when they see that men consent to be served by means of such things, 
they take them and make them their slaves. But how can it be honourable to 
minister to adulteries? How can it be noble to stimulate men in hating one 
another? Or how is it becoming to ascribe to matter the relief of the insane, 
and not to God? For by their art they turn men aside from the pious 
acknowledgment of God, leading them to place confidence in herbs and roots. But 
God, if He had prepared these things to effect just what men wish, would be a 
Producer of evil things; whereas He Himself produced everything which has good 
qualities, but the profligacy of the demons has made use of the productions of 
nature for evil purposes, and the appearance of evil which these wear is from 
them, and not from the perfect God. For how comes it to pass that when alive I 
was in no wise evil, but that now I am dead and can do nothing, my remains, 
which are incapable of motion or even sense, should effect something cognizable 
by the senses? And how shall he who has died by the most miserable death be able 
to assist in avenging any one? If this were possible, much more might he defend 
himself from his own enemy; being able to assist others, much more might he 
constitute himself his own avenger. 
CHAP. XVIII.--THEY DECEIVE, INSTEAD OF HEALING. 
But medicine and everything included in it is an invention of the same kind. 
If any one is healed by matter, through trusting to it, much more will he be 
healed by having recourse to the power of God. As noxious preparations arc 
material compounds, so are curatives of the same nature. If, however, we reject 
the baser matter, some persons often endeavour to heal by a union of one of 
these bad things with some other, and will make use of the bad to attain the 
good. But, just as he who dines with a robber, though he may not be a robber 
himself, partakes of the punishment on account of his intimacy with him, so he 
who is not bad but associates with the bad, having dealings with them for some 
supposed good, will be punished by God the Judge for partnership in the same 
object. Why is he who trusts in the system of matter not willing to trust in 
God? For what reason do you not approach the more powerful Lord, but rather seek 
to cure yourself, like the dog with grass, or the stag with a viper, or the hog 
with river-crabs, or the lion with apes? Why you deify the objects of nature? 
And why, when you cure your neighbour, are you called a benefactor? Yield to the 
power of the Logos! The demons do not cure, but by their art make men their 
captives. And the most admirable Justin has rightly denounced them as robbers. 
For, as it is the practice of some to capture persons and then to restore them 
to their friends for a ransom, so those who are esteemed gods, invading the 
bodies of certain persons, and producing a sense of their presence by dreams, 
command them to come forth into public, and in the sight of all, when they have 
taken their fill of the things of this world, fly away from the sick, and, 
destroying the disease which they had produced, restore men to their former 
state CHAP. XIX.--DEPRAVITY LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF DEMON-WORSHIP. 
But do you, who have not the perception of these things, be instructed by us 
who know them: though you do profess to despise death, and to be sufficient of 
yourselves for everything. But this is a discipline in which your philosophers 
are so greatly deficient, that some of them receive from the king of the Romans 
600 aurei yearly, for no useful service they perform, but that they may not even 
wear a long beard without being paid for it! Crescens, who made his nest in the 
great city, surpassed all men in unnatural love (paiderastia), and was 
strongly addicted to the love of money. Yet this man, who professed to despise 
death, was so afraid of death, that he endeavoured to inflict on Justin, and 
indeed on me, the punishment of death, as being an evil, because by proclaiming 
the truth he convicted the philosophers of being gluttons and cheats. But whom 
of the philosophers, save you only, was he accustomed to inveigh against? If you 
say, in agreement with our tenets, that death is not to be dreaded, do not court 
death from an insane love of fame among men, like Anaxagoras, but become 
despisers of death by reason of the knowledge of God. The construction of the 
world is excellent, but the life men live in it is bad; and we may see those 
greeted with applause as in a solemn assembly who know not God. For what is 
divination? and why are ye deceived by it? It is a minister to thee of worldly 
lusts. You wish make war, and you take Apollo as a counsellor of slaughter. You 
want to carry off a maiden by force, and you select a divinity to be your 
accomplice. You are ill by your own fault; and, as Agamemnon wished for ten 
councillors, so you wish to have gods with you. Some woman by drinking water 
gets into a frenzy, and loses her senses by the fumes of frankincense, and you 
say that she has the gift of prophecy. Apollo was a prognosticator and a teacher 
of soothsayers: in the matter of Daphne he deceived himself. An oak, forsooth, 
is oracular, and birds utter presages! And so you are inferior to animals and 
plants! It would surely be a fine thing for you to become a divining rod, or to 
assume the wings of a bird! He who makes you fond of money also foretells your 
getting rich; he who excites to seditions and wars also predicts victory in war. 
If you are superior to the passions, you will despise all worldly things. Do not 
abhor us who have made this attainment, but, repudiating the demons, follow the 
one God. "All things were made by Him, and without Him not one thing was made." 
If there is poison in natural productions, this has supervened through our 
sinfulness. I am able to show the perfect truth of these things; only do you 
hearken, and he who believes will understand. 
CHAP. XX.--THANKS ARE EVER DUE TO GOD. 
Even if you be healed by drugs (I grant you that point by courtesy), yet it 
behoves you to give testimony of the cure to God. For the world still draws us 
down, and through weakness I incline towards matter. For the wings of the soul 
were the perfect spirit, but, having cast this off through sin, it flutters like 
a nestling and falls to the ground. Having left the heavenly companionship, it 
hankers after communion with inferior things. The demons were driven forth to 
another abode; the first created human beings were expelled from their place: 
the one, indeed, were cast down from heaven; but the other were driven from 
earth, yet not out of this earth, but from a more excellent order of things than 
exists here now. And now it behoves us, yearning after that pristine state, to 
put aside everything that proves a hindrance. The heavens are not infinite, O 
man, but finite and bounded; and beyond them are the superior worlds which have 
not a change of seasons, by which various, diseases are produced, but, partaking 
of every happy temperature, have perpetual day, and light unapproachable by men 
below. Those who have composed elaborate descriptions of the earth have given an 
account of its various regions so far as this was possible to man; but, being 
unable to speak of that which is beyond, because Of the impossibility of 
personal observation, they have assigned as the cause the existence of tides; 
and that one sea is filled with weed, and another with mud; and that some 
localities are burnt up with heat, and others cold and frozen. We, however, have 
learned things which were unknown to us, through the teaching of the prophets, 
who, being fully persuaded that the heavenly spirit along with the soul will 
acquire a clothing of mortality, foretold things which other minds were 
unacquainted with. But it is possible for every one who is naked to obtain this 
apparel, and to return to its ancient kindred. 
CHAP.XXI.--DOCTRINES OF THE CHRISTIANS AND GREEKS RESPECTING GOD COMPARED. 
We do not act as fools, O Greeks, nor utter idle tales, when we announce that 
God was born in the form of a man. I call on you who reproach us to compare your 
mythical accounts with our narrations. Athene, as they say, took the form of 
Deiphobus for the sake of Hector, and the unshorn Phoebus for the sake of 
Admetus fed the trailing-footed oxen, and the spouse us came as an old woman to 
Semele. But, while you treat seriously such things, how can you deride us? Your 
Asclepios died, and he who ravished fifty virgins in one night at Thespiae lost 
his life by delivering himself to the devouring flame. 
Prometheus, fastened to Caucasus, suffered punishment for his good deeds to 
men. According to you, Zeus is envious, and hides the dream from men, wishing 
their destruction. Wherefore, looking at your own memorials, vouchsafe us your 
approval, though it were only as dealing in legends similar to your own. We, 
however, do not deal in folly, but your legends are only idle tales. 
If you speak of the origin of the gods, you also declare them to be mortal. 
For what reason is Hera now never pregnant? Has she grown old? or is there no 
one to give you information? Believe me now, O Greeks, and do not resolve your 
myths and gods into allegory. If you attempt to do this, the divine nature as 
held by you is overthrown by your own selves; for, if the demons with you are 
such as they are said to be, they are worthless as to character; or, if regarded 
as symbols of the powers of nature, they are not what they are called. But I 
cannot be persuaded to pay religious homage to the natural elements, nor can I 
undertake to persuade my neighbour. And Metrodorus of Lampsacus, in his treatise 
concerning Homer, has argued very foolishly, turning everything into allegory. 
For he says that neither Hera, nor Athene, nor Zeus are what those persons 
suppose who consecrate to them sacred enclosures and groves, but parts of nature 
and certain arrangements of the elements. Hector also, and Achilles, and 
Agamemnon, and all the Greeks in general, and the Barbarians with Helen and 
Paris, being of the same nature, you will of course say are introduced merely 
for the sake of the machinery of the poem, not one of these personages having 
really existed. But these things we have put forth only for argument's sake; for 
it is not allowable even to compare our notion of God with those who are 
wallowing in matter and mud. 
CHAP. XXII.--RIDICULE OF THE SOLEMNITIES OF THE GREEKS. 
And of what sort are your teachings? Who must not treat with contempt your 
solemn festivals, which, being held in honour of wicked demons, cover men with 
infamy? I have often seen a man --and have been amazed to see, and the amazement 
has ended in contempt, to think how he is one thing internally, but outwardly 
counterfeits what he is not--giving himself excessive airs of daintiness and 
indulging in all sorts of effeminacy; sometimes darting his eyes about; 
sometimes throwing his hands hither and thither, and raving with his face 
smeared with mud; sometimes personating Aphrodite, sometimes Apollo; a solitary 
accuser of all the gods, an epitome of superstition, a vituperator of heroic 
deeds, an actor of murders, a chronicler of adultery, a storehouse of madness, a 
teacher of cynaedi, an instigator of capital sentences;--and yet such a man is 
praised by all. But I have rejected all his falsehoods, his impiety, his 
practices,--in short, the man altogether. But you are led captive by such men, 
while you revile those who do not take a part in your pursuits. I have no mind 
to stand agape at a number of singers, nor do I desire to be affected in 
sympathy with a man when he is winking and gesticulating in an unnatural manner. 
What wonderful or extraordinary thing is performed among you? They utter 
ribaldry in affected tones, and go through indecent movements; your daughters 
and your sons behold them giving lessons in adultery on the stage. Admirable 
places, forsooth, are your lecture-rooms, where every base action perpetrated by 
night is proclaimed aloud, and the hearers are regaled with the utterance of 
infamous discourses! Admirable, too, are your mendacious poets, who by their 
fictions beguile their hearers from the truth! 
CHAP. XXIII.--OF THE PUGILISTS AND GLADIATORS, 
I have seen men weighed down by bodily exercise, and carrying about the 
burden of their flesh, before whom rewards and chaplets are set, while the 
adjudicators cheer them on, not to deeds of virtue, but to rivalry in violence 
and discord; and he who excels in giving blows is crowned. These are the lesser 
evils; as for the greater, who would not shrink from telling them? Some, giving 
themselves up to idleness for the sake of profligacy, sell themselves to be 
killed; and the indigent barters himself away, while the rich man buys others to 
kill him. And for these the witnesses take their seats, and the boxers meet in 
single combat, for no reason whatever, nor does any one come down into the arena 
to succour. Do such exhibitions as these redound to your credit? He who is chief 
among you collects a legion of blood-stained murderers, engaging to maintain 
them; and these ruffians are sent forth by him, and you assemble at the 
spectacle to be judges, partly of the wickedness of the adjudicator, and partly 
of that of the men who engage in the combat. And he who misses the murderous 
exhibition is grieved, because he was not doomed to be a spectator of wicked and 
impious and abominable deeds. You slaughter animals for the purpose of eating 
their flesh, and you purchase men to supply a cannibal banquet for the soul, 
nourishing it by the most impious bloodshedding. The robber commits murder for 
the sake of plunder, but the rich man purchases gladiators for the sake of their 
being killed. 
CHAP. XXIV.--OF THE OTHER PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS. 
What advantage should I gain from him who is brought on the stage by 
Euripides raving mad, and acting the matricide of Alcmaeon; who does not even 
retain his natural behaviour, but with his mouth wide open goes about sword in 
hand, and, screaming aloud, is burned to death, habited in a robe unfit for man? 
Away, too, with the mythical tales of Acusilaus, and Menander, a versifier of 
the same class! And why should I admire the mythic piper? Why should I busy 
myself about the Theban Antigenides, like Aristoxenus? We leave you to these 
worthless things; and do you either believe our doctrines, or, like us, give up 
yours. 
CHAP. XXV.--BOASTINGS AND QUARRELS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS. 
What great and wonderful things have your philosophers effected? They leave 
uncovered one of their shoulders; they let their hair grow long; they cultivate 
their beards; their nails are like the claws of wild beasts. Though they say 
that they want nothing, yet, like Proteus, they need a currier for their wallet, 
and a weaver for their mantle, and a wood-cutter for their staff, and the rich, 
and a cook also for their gluttony. O man competing with the dog, you know not 
God, and so have turned to the imitation of an irrational animal. You cry out in 
public with an assumption of authority, and take upon you to avenge your own 
self; and if you receive nothing, you indulge in abuse, and philosophy is with 
you the art of getting money. You follow the doctrines of Plato, and a disciple 
of Epicurus lifts up his voice to oppose you. Again, you wish to be a disciple 
of Aristotle, and a follower of Democritus rails at you. Pythagoras says that he 
was Euphorbus, and he is the heir of the doctrine of Pherecydes; but Aristotle 
impugns the immortality of the soul. You who receive from your predecessors 
doctrines which clash with one another, you the inharmonious, are fighting 
against the harmonious. One of you asserts that God is body, but I assert that 
He is without body; that the world is indestructible, but I say that it is to be 
destroyed; that a conflagration will take place at various times, but I say that 
it will come to pass once for all; that Minos and Rhadamanthus are judges, but I 
say that God Himself is Judge; that the soul alone is endowed with immortality, 
but I say that the flesh also is endowed with it. What injury do we inflict upon 
you, O Greeks? Why do you hate those who follow the word of God, as if they were 
the vilest of mankind? It is not we who eat human flesh --they among you who 
assert such a thing have been suborned as false witnesses; it is among you that 
Pelops is made a supper for the gods, although beloved by Poseidon, and Kronos 
devours his children, and Zeus swallows Metis. 
CHAP. XXVI.- RIDICULE OF THE STUDIES OF THE GREEKS. 
Cease to make a parade of sayings which you have derived from others, and to 
deck yourselves like the daw in borrowed plumes. If each state were to take away 
its contribution to your speech, your fallacies would lose their power. While 
inquiring what God is, you are ignorant of what is in yourselves; and, while 
staring all agape at the sky, you stumble into pitfalls. The reading of your 
books is like walking through a labyrinth, and their readers resemble the cask 
of the Danaids. Why do you divide time, saying that one part is past, and 
another present, and another future? For how can the future be passing when the 
present exists? As those who are sailing imagine in their ignorance, as the ship 
is borne along, that the hills are in motion, so you do not know that it is you 
who are passing along, but that time (o aiwn) remains present as 
long as the Creator wills it to exist. Why am I called to account for uttering 
my opinions, and why are you in such haste to put them all down? Were not you 
born in the same manner as ourselves, and placed under the same government of 
the world? Why say that wisdom is with you alone, who have not another sun, nor 
other risings of the stars, nor a more distinguished origin, nor a death 
preferable to that of other men? The grammarians have been the beginning of this 
idle talk; and you who parcel out wisdom are cut off from the wisdom that is 
according to truth, and assign the names of the several parts to particular men; 
and you know not God, but in your fierce contentions destroy one another. And on 
this account you are all nothing worth. While you arrogate to yourselves the 
sole right of discussion, you discourse like the blind man with the deaf. Why do 
you handle the builder's tools without knowing how to build? Why do you busy 
yourselves with words, while you keep aloof from deeds, puffed up with praise, 
but cast down by misfortunes? Your modes of acting are contrary to reaSon, for 
you make a pompons appearance in public, but hide your teaching in corners. 
Finding you to be such men as these, we have abandoned you, and no longer 
concern ourselves with your tenets, but follow the word of God. Why, O man, do 
you set the letters of the alphabet at war with one another? Why do you, as in a 
boxing match, make their sounds clash together with your mincing Attic way of 
speaking, whereas you ought to speak more according to nature? For if you adopt 
the Attic dialect though not an Athenian, pray why do you not speak like the 
Dorians? How is it that one appears to you more rugged, the other more pleasant 
for intercourse? 
CHAP. XXVII.- THE CHRISTIANS ARE HATED UNJUSTLY. 
And if you adhere to their teaching, why do you fight against me for choosing 
such views of doctrine as I approve? Is it not unreasonable that, while the 
robber is not to be punished for the name he bears, but only when the truth 
about him has been clearly ascertained, yet we are to be assailed with abuse on 
a judgment formed without examination? Diagoras was an Athenian, but you 
punished him for divulging the Athenian mysteries; yet you who read his Phrygian 
discourses hate us. You possess the commentaries of Leo, and are displeased with 
our refutations of them; and having in your hands the opinions of Apion 
concerning the Egyptian gods, you denounce us as most impious. The tomb of 
Olympian Zeus is shown among you, though some one says that the Cretans are 
liars. Your assembly of many gods is nothing. Though their despiser Epicurus 
acts as a torch-bearer, I do not any the more conceal from the rulers that view 
of God which I hold in relation to His government of the universe. Why do you 
advise me to be false to my principles? Why do you who say that you despise 
death exhort us to use art in order to escape it? I have not the heart of a 
deer; but your zeal for dialectics resembles the loquacity of Thersites. How can 
I believe one who tells me that the sun is a red-hot mass and the moon an earth? 
Such assertions are mere logomachies, and not a sober exposition of truth. How 
can it be otherwise than foolish to credit the books of Herodotus relating to 
the history of Hercules, which tell of an upper earth from which the lion came 
down that was killed by Hercules? And what avails the Attic style, the sorites 
of philosophers, the plausibilities of syllogisms, the measurements of the 
earth, the positions of the stars, and the course of the sun? To be occupied in 
such inquiries is the work of one who imposes opinions on himself as if they 
were laws. 
CHAP. XXVIII.--CONDEMNATION OF THE GREEK LEGISLATION. 
On this account I reject your legislation also; for there ought to be one 
common polity for all; but now there are as many different codes as there are 
states, so that things held disgraceful in some are honourable in others. The 
Greeks consider intercourse with a mother as unlawful, but this practice is 
esteemed most becoming by the Persian Magi; paederasty is condemned by the 
Barbarians, but by the Romans, who endeavour to collect herds of boys like 
grazing horses, it is honoured with certain privileges. 
CHAP. XXIX.- ACCOUNT OF TATIAN'S CONVERSION. 
Wherefore, having seen these things, and moreover also having been admitted 
to the mysteries, and having everywhere examined the religious rites performed 
by the effeminate and the pathic, and having found among the Romans their 
Latiarian Jupiter delighting in human gore and the blood of slaughtered men, and 
Artemis not far from the great city sanctioning acts of the same kind, and one 
demon here and another there instigating to the perpetration of evil,--retiring 
by myself, I sought how I might be able to discover the truth. And, while I was 
giving my most earnest attention to the matter, I happened to meet with certain 
barbaric writings, too old to be compared with the opinions of the Greeks, and 
too divine to be compared with their errors; and I was led to put faith in these 
by the unpretending east of the language, the inartificial character of the 
writers, the foreknowledge displayed of future events, the excellent quality of 
the precepts, and the declaration of the government of the universe as centred 
in one Being. And, my soul being taught of God, I discern that the former class 
of writings lead to condemnation, but that these put an end to the slavery that 
is in the world, and rescue us from a multiplicity of rulers and ten thousand 
tyrants, while they give us, not indeed what we had not before received, but 
what we had received but were prevented by error from retaining. 
CHAP. XXX.--HOW HE RESOLVED TO RESIST THE DEVIL. 
Therefore, being initiated and instructed in these things, I wish to put away 
my former errors as the follies of childhood. For we know that the nature of 
wickedness is like that of the smallest seeds; since it has waxed strong from a 
small beginning, but will again be destroyed if we obey the words of God and do 
not scatter ourselves. For He has become master of all we have by means of a 
certain "hidden treasure," which while we are digging for we are indeed covered 
with dust, but we secure it as our fixed possession. He who receives the whole 
of this treasure has obtained command of the most precious wealth. Let these 
things, then, be said to our friends. But to you Greeks what can I say, except 
to request you not to rail at those who are better than yourselves, nor if they 
are called Barbarians to make that an occasion of banter? For, if you are 
willing, you will be able to find out the cause of mews not being able to 
understand one another's language; for to those who wish to examine our 
principles I will give a simple and copious account of them. 
CHAP. XXXI.--THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE CHRISTIANS MORE ANCIENT THAN THAT OF THE 
GREEKS. 
But now it seems proper for me to demonstrate that our philosophy is older 
than the systems of the Greeks. Moses and Homer shall be our limits, each of 
them being of great antiquity; the one being the oldest of poets and historians, 
and the other the founder of all barbarian wisdom. Let us, then, institute a 
comparison between them; and we shall find that our doctrines are older, not 
only than those of the Greeks, but than the invention of letters. And I will not 
bring forward witnesses from among ourselves, but rather have recourse to 
Greeks. To do the former would be foolish, because it would not be allowed by 
you; but the other will surprise you, when, by contending against you with your 
own weapons, I adduce arguments of which you had no suspicion. Now the poetry of 
Homer, his parentage, and the time in which he flourished have been investigated 
by the most ancient writers,--by Theagenes of Rhegium, who lived in the time of 
Cambyses, Stesimbrotus of Thasos and Antimachus of Colophon, Herodotus of 
Halicarnassus, and Dionysius the Olynthian; after them, by Ephorus of Cumae, and 
Philochorus the Athenian, Megaclides and Chamaeleon the Peripatetics; afterwards 
by the grammarians, Zenodotus, Aristophanes, Callimachus, Crates, Eratosthenes, 
Aristarchus, and Apollodorus. Of these, Crates says that he flourished before 
the return of the Heraclidae, and within 80 years after the Trojan war; 
Eratosthenes says that it was after the 100th year from the taking of Ilium; 
Aristarchus, that it was about the time of the Ionian migration, which was 140 
years after that event; but, according to Philochorus, after the Ionian 
migration, in the archonship of Archippus at Athens, 180 years after the Trojan 
war; Apollodorus says it was 100 years after the Ionian migration, which would 
be 240 years after the Trojan war. Some say that he lived 90 years before the 
Olympiads, which would be 317 years after the taking of Troy. Others carry it 
down to a later date, and say that Homer was a contemporary of Archilochus; but 
Archilochus flourished about the 23d Olympiad, in the time of Gyges the Lydian, 
500 years after Troy. Thus, concerning the age of the aforesaid poet, I mean 
Homer, and the discrepancies of those who have spoken of him, we have said 
enough in a summary manner for those who are able to investigate with accuracy. 
For it is possible to show that the opinions held about the facts themselves 
also are false. For, where the assigned dates do not agree together, it is 
impossible that the history should be true. For what is the cause of error in 
writing, but the narrating of things that are not true? 
CHAP. XXXII. --THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIANS, IS OPPOSED TO DISSENSIONS, AND 

FITTED FOR ALL. 
But with us there is no desire of vainglory, nor do we indulge in a variety 
of opinions. For having renounced the popular and earthly, and obeying the 
commands of God, and following the law of the Father of immortality, we reject 
everything which rests upon human opinion. Not only do the rich among us pursue 
our philosophy, but the poor enjoy instruction gratuitously; for the things 
which come from God surpass the requital of worldly gifts. Thus we admit all who 
desire to hear, even old women and striplings; and, in short, persons of every 
age are treated by us with respect, but every kind of licentiousness is kept at 
a distance. And in speaking we do not utter falsehood. It would be an excellent 
thing if your continuance in unbelief should receive a check; but, however that 
may be, let our cause remain confirmed by the judgment pronounced by God. Laugh, 
if you please; but you will have to weep hereafter. Is it not absurd that 
Nestor, who was slow at cutting his horses' reins owing to his weak and sluggish 
old age, is, according to you, to be admired for attempting to rival the young 
men in fighting, while you deride those among us who struggle against old age 
and occupy themselves with the things pertaining to God? Who would not laugh 
when you tell us that the Amazons, and Semiramis, and certain other warlike 
women existed, while you cast reproaches on our maidens? Achilles was a youth, 
yet is believed to have been very magnanimous; and Neoptolemus was younger, but 
strong; Philoctetes was weak, but the divinity had need of him against Troy. 
What sort of man was Thersites? yet he held a command in the army, and, if he 
had not through doltishness had such an unbridled tongue, he would not have been 
reproached for being peak-headed and bald. As for those who wish to learn our 
philosophy, we do not test them by their looks, nor do we judge of those who 
come to us by their outward appearance; for we argue that there may be strength 
of mind in all, though they may be weak in body. But your proceedings are full 
of envy and abundant stupidity. 
CHAP. XXXIII.--VINDICATION OF CHRISTIAN WOMEN. 
Therefore I have been desirous to prove from the things which are esteemed 
honourable among you, that our institutions are marked by sobermindedness, but 
that yours are in close affinity with madness. You who say that we talk nonsense 
among women and boys, among maidens and old women, and scoff at us for not being 
with you, hear what silliness prevails among the Greeks. For their works of art 
are devoted to worthless objects, while they are held in higher estimation by 
you than even your gods; and you behave yourselves unbecomingly in what relates 
to woman. For Lysippus cast a statue of Praxilla, whose poems contain nothing 
useful, and Menestratus one of Learchis, and Selanion one of Sappho the 
courtezan, and Naucydes one of Erinna the Lesbian, and Boiscus one of Myrtis, 
and Cephisodotus one of Myro of Byzantium, and Gomphus one of Praxigoris, and 
Amphistratus one of Clito. And what shall I say about Anyta, Telesilla, and 
Mystis? Of the first Euthycrates and Cephisodotus made a statue, and of the 
second Niceratus, and of the third Aristodotus; Euthycrates made one of 
Mnesiarchis the Ephesian, Selanion one of Corinna, and Euthycrates one of 
Thalarchis the Argive. My object in referring to these women is, that you may 
not regard as something strange what you find among us, and that, comparing the 
statues which are before your eyes, you may not treat the women with scorn who 
among us pursue philosophy. This Sappho is a lewd, love-sick female, and sings 
her own wantonness; but all our women are chaste, and the maidens at their 
distaffs sing of divine things more nobly than that damsel of yours. Wherefore 
be ashamed, you who are professed disciples of women yet scoff at those of the 
sex who hold our doctrine, as well as at the solemn assemblies they frequent. 
What a noble infant did Glaucippe present to you, who brought forth a prodigy, 
as is shown by her statue cast by Niceratus, the son of Euctemon the Athenian! 
But, if Glaucippe brought forth an elephant, was that a reason why she should 
enjoy public honours? Praxiteles and Herodotus made for you Phryne the 
courtezan, and Euthycrates cast a brazen statue of Panteuchis, who was pregnant 
by a whoremonger; and Dinomenes, because Besantis queen of the Paeonians gave 
birth to a black infant, took pains to preserve her memory by his art. I condemn 
Pythagoras too, who made a figure of Europa on the bull; and you also, who 
honour the accuser of Zeus on account of his artistic skill. And I ridicule the 
skill of Myron, who made a heifer and upon it a Victory because by carrying off 
the daughter of Agenor it had borne away the prize for adultery and lewdness. 
The Olynthian Herodotus made statues of Glycera the courtezan and Argeia the 
harper. Bryaxis made a statue of Pasiphae; and, by having a memorial of her 
lewdness, it seems to have been almost your desire that the women of the present 
time should be like her. A certain Melanippe was a wise woman, and for that 
reason Lysistratus made her statue. But, forsooth, you will not believe that 
among us there are wise women! 
CHAP. XXXIV.--RIDICULE OF THE STATUES ERECTED BY THE GREEKS. 
Worthy of very great honour, certainly, was the tyrant Bhalaris, who devoured 
sucklings, and accordingly is exhibited by the workmanship of Polystratus the 
Ambraciot, even to this day, as a very wonderful man! The Agrigentines dreaded 
to look on that countenance of his, because of his cannibalism; but people of 
culture now make it their boast that they behold him in his statue! Is it not 
shameful that fratricide is honoured by you who look on the statues of Polynices 
and Eteocles, and that you have not rather buried them with their maker 
Pythagoras? Destroy these memorials of iniquity! Why should I contemplate with 
admiration the figure of the woman who bore thirty children, merely for the sake 
of the artist Periclymenus? One ought to turn away with disgust from one who 
bore off the fruits of great incontinence, and whom the Romans compared to a 
sow, which also on a like account, they say, was deemed worthy of a mystic 
worship. Ares committed adultery with Aphrodite, and Andron made an image of 
their offspring Harmonia. Sophron, who committed to writing trifles and 
absurdities, was more celebrated for his skill in casting metals, of which 
specimens exist even now. And not only have his tales kept the fabulist Aesop in 
everlasting remembrance, but also the plastic art of Aristodemus has increased 
his celebrity. How is it then that you, who have so many poetesses whose 
productions are mere trash, and innumerable courtezans, and worthless men, are 
not ashamed to slander the reputation of our women? What care I to know that 
Euanthe gave birth to an infant in the Peripatus, or to gape with wonder at the 
art of Callistratus, or to fix my gaze on the Neaera of Calliades? For she was a 
courtezan. Lais was a prostitute, and Turnus made her a monument of 
prostitution. Why are you not ashamed of the fornication of Hephaestion, even 
though Philo has represented him very artistically? And for what reason do you 
honour the hermaphrodite Ganymede by Leochares, as if you possessed something 
admirable? Praxiteles even made a statue of a woman with the stain of impurity 
upon it. It behoved you, repudiating everything of this kind, to seek what is 
truly worthy of attention, and not to turn with disgust from our mode of life 
while receiving with approval the shameful productions of Philaenis and 
Elephantis. 
CHAP. XXXV.--TATIAN SPEAKS AS AN EYE-WITNESS. 
The things which I have thus set before you I have not learned at second 
hand. I have visited many lands; I have followed rhetoric, like yourselves; I 
have fallen in with many arts and inventions; and finally, when sojourning in 
the city of the Romans, I inspected the multiplicity of statues brought thither 
by you: for I do not attempt, as is the custom with many, to strengthen my own 
views by the opinions of others, but I wish to give you a distinct account of 
what I myself have seen and felt. So, bidding farewell to the arrogance of 
Romans and the idle talk of Athenians, and all their ill-connected opinions, I 
embraced our barbaric philosophy. I began to show how this was more ancient than 
your institutions, but left my task unfinished, in order to discuss a matter 
which demanded more immediate attention; but now it is time I should attempt to 
speak concerning its doctrines. Be not offended with our teaching, nor undertake 
an elaborate reply filled with trifling and ribaldry, saying, "Tatian, aspiring 
to be above the Greeks, above the infinite number of philosophic inquirers, has 
struck out a new path, and embraced the doctrines of Barbarians." For what 
grievance is it, that men manifestly ignorant should be reasoned with by a man 
of like nature with themselves? Or how can it be irrational, according to your 
own sophist, to grow old always learning something? 
CHAP.XXXVI.--TESTIMONY OF THE CHALDEANS TO THE ANTIQUITY OF MOSES. 
But let Homer be not later than the Trojan war; let it be granted that he was 
contemporary with it, or even that he was in the army of Agamemnon, and, if any 
so please, that he lived before the invention of letters. The Moses before 
mentioned will be shown to have been many years older than the taking of Troy, 
and far more ancient than the building of Troy, or than Tros and Dardanus. To 
demonstrate this I will call in as witnesses the Chaldeans, the Phoenicians and 
the Egyptians. And what more need I say? For it behoves one who professes to 
persuade his hearers to make his narrative of events very concise. Berosus, a 
Babylonian, a priest of their god Belus, born in the time of Alexander, composed 
for Antiochus, the third after him, the history of the Chaldeans in three books; 
and, narrating the acts of the kings, he mentions one of them, Nabuchodonosor by 
name, who made war against the Phoenicians and the Jews,events which we know 
were announced by our prophets, and which happened much later than the age of 
Moses, seventy years before the Persian empire. But Berosus is a very 
trustworthy man, and of this Juba is a witness, who, writing concerning the 
Assyrians, says that he learned the history from Berosus: there are two books of 
his concerning the Assyrians. 
CHAP. XXXVII.--TESTIMONY OF THE PHOENICIANS. 
After the Chaldeans, the testimony of the Phoenicians is as follows. There 
were among them three men, Theodotus, Hypsicrates, and Mochus; Chaitus 
translated their books into Greek, and also composed with exactness the lives of 
the philosophers. Now, in the histories of the aforesaid writers it is shown 
that the abduction of Europa happened under one of the kings, and an account is 
given of the coming of Menelaus into Phoenicia, and of the matters relating to 
Chiramus, who gave his daughter in marriage to Solomon the king of the Jews, and 
supplied wood of all kind of trees for the building of the temple. Menander of 
Pergamus composed a history concerning the same things. But the age of Chiramus 
is somewhere about the Trojan war; but Solomon, the contemporary of Chiramus, 
lived much later than the age of Moses. 
CHAP. XXXVIII.--THE EGYPTIANS PLACE MOSES IN THE REIGN OF INACHUS. 
Of the Egyptians also there are accurate chronicles. Ptolemy, not the king, 
but a priest of Mendes, is the interpreter of their affairs. This writer, 
narrating the acts of the kings, says that the departure of the Jews from Egypt 
to the places whither they went occurred in the time of king Amosis, under the 
leadership of Moses. He thus speaks: "Amosis lived in the time of king Inachus." 
After him, Apion the grammarian, a man most highly esteemed, in the fourth book 
of his AEgyptiaca (there are five books of his), besides many other things, says 
that Amosis destroyed Avaris in the time of the Argive Inachus, as the Mendesian 
Ptolemy wrote in his annals. But the time from Inachus to the taking of Troy 
occupies twenty generations. The steps of the demonstration are the following:- 
CHAP. XXXIX.--CATALOGUE OF THE ARGIVE KINGS. 
The kings of the Argives were these: Inachus, Phoroneus, Apis, Criasis, 
Triopas, Argeius, Phorbas, Crotopas, Sthenelaus, Danaus, Lynceus, Proetus, Abas, 
Acrisius, Perseus, Sthenelaus, Eurystheus, Atreus, Thyestes, and Agamemnon, in 
the eighteenth year of whose reign Troy was taken. And every intelligent person 
will most carefully observe that, according to the tradition of the Greeks, they 
possessed no historical composition; for Cadmus, who taught them letters, came 
into Boeotia many generations later. But after Inachus, under Phoroneus, a check 
was with difficulty given to their savage and nomadic life, and they entered 
upon a new order of things. Wherefore, if Moses is shown to be contemporary with 
Inachus, he is four hundred years older than the Trojan war. But this is 
demonstrated from the succession of the Attic, [and of the 
Macedonian, the Ptolemaic, and the Antiochian] kings. Hence, if the most 
illustrious deeds among the Greeks were recorded and made known after Inachus, 
it is manifest that this must have been after Moses. In the time of Phoroneus, 
who was after Inachus, Ogygus is mentioned among the Athenians, in whose time 
was the first deluge; and in the time of Phorbas was Actaeus, from whom Attica 
was called Actaea; and in the time of Triopas were Prometheus, and Epimetheus, 
and Arias, and Cecrops of double nature, and Io; in the time of Crotopas was the 
burning of Phaethon and the flood of Deucalion; in the time of Sthenelus was the 
reign of Amphictyon and the coming of Danaus into Peloponnesus, and the founding 
of Dardania by Dardanus, and the return of Europa from phoenicia to Crete; in 
the time of Lynceus was the abduction of Kore, and the founding of the temple in 
Eleusis, and the husbandry of Triptolemus, and the coming of Cadmus to Thebes, 
and the reign of Minos; in the time of Proetus was the war of Eumolpus against 
the Athenians; in the time of Acrisius was the coming over of Pelops from 
Phrygia, and the coming of Ion to Athens, and the second Cecrops, and the deeds 
of Perseus and Dionysus, and Musaeus, the disciple of Orpheus; and in the reign 
of Agamemnon Troy was taken. 
CHAP.XL.--MOSES MORE ANCIENT AND CREDIBLE THAN THE HEATHEN HEROES. 
Therefore, from what has been said it is evident that Moses was older than 
the ancient heroes, wars, and demons. And we ought rather to believe him, who 
stands before them in point of age, than the Greeks, who, without being aware of 
it, drew his doctrines from a fountain. For many of the sophists among them, 
stimulated by curiosity, endeavoured to adulterate whatever they learned from 
Moses, and from those who have philosophized like him, first that they might be 
considered as having something of their own, and secondly, that covering up by a 
certain rhetorical artifice whatever things they did not understand, they might 
misrepresent the truth as if it were a fable. But what the learned among the 
Greeks have said concerning our polity and the history of our laws, and how many 
and what kind of men have written of these things, will be shown in the treatise 
against those who have discoursed of divine things. 
CHAP. XLI. 
But the matter of principal importance is to endeavour with all accuracy to 
make it clear that Moses is not only older than Homer, but than all the writers 
that were before him--older than Linus, Philammon, Thamyris, Amphion, Musaeus, 
Orpheus, Demodocus, Phemius, Sibylla, Epimenides of Crete, who came to Sparta, 
Aristaeus of Proconnesus, who wrote the Arimaspia, Asbolus the Centaur, Isatis, 
Drymon, Euclus the Cyprian, Horus the Samian, and Pronapis the Athenian. Now, 
Linus was the teacher of Hercules, but Hercules preceded the Trojan war by one 
generation; and this is manifest from his son Tlepolemus, who served in the army 
against Troy. And Orpheus lived at the same time as Hercules; moreover, it is 
said that all the works attributed to him were composed by Onomacritus the 
Athenian, who lived during the reign of the Pisistratids, about the fiftieth 
Olympiad. Musaeus was a disciple of Orpheus. 
Amphion, since he preceded the siege of Troy by two generations, forbids our 
collecting further particulars about him for those who are desirous of 
information. Demodocus and Phemius lived at the very time of the Trojan war; for 
the one resided with the suitors, and the other with the Phaeacians. 
Thamyris and Philammon were not much earlier than these. Thus, concerning 
their several performances in each kind, and their times and the record of them, 
we have written very fully, and, as I think, with all exactness. But, that we 
may complete. what is still wanting, I will give my explanation respecting the 
men who are esteemed wise. Minos, who has been thought to excel in every kind of 
wisdom, and mental acuteness, and legislative capacity, lived in the time of 
Lynceus, who reigned after Danaus in the eleventh generation after Inachus. 
Lycurgus, who was born long after the taking of Troy, gave laws to the 
Lacedemonians. Draco is found to have lived about the thirty-ninth Olympiad, 
Solon about the forty-sixth, and Pythagoras about the sixty-second. 
We have shown that the Olympiads commenced 407 years after the taking of 
Troy. 
These facts being demonstrated, we shall briefly remark concerning the age of 
the seven wise men. The oldest of these, Thales, lived about the fiftieth 
Olympiad; and I have already spoken briefly of those who came after him. 
CHAP. XLII.--CONCLUDING STATEMENT AS TO THE AUTHOR. 
These things, O Greeks, I Tatian, a disciple of the barbarian philosophy, 
have composed for you. I was born in the land of the Assyrians, having been 
first instructed in your doctrines, and afterwards in those which I now 
undertake to proclaim. Henceforward, knowing who God is and what is His work, I 
present myself to you prepared for an examination concerning my doctrines, while 
I adhere immoveably to that mode of life which is according to God.
