The Apocalypse of John












The Revelation to Saint John 

1:1The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which 
God gave him to show unto his servants, even the things which must 
shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his 
servant John; 1:2who bare witness of the word of God, and 
of the testimony of Jesus Christ, even of all things that he saw. 1:3Blessed is he that readeth, and they 
that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written 
therein: for the time is at hand. 1:4John to the seven churches that are in 
Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him who is and who was and who is to come; 
and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne; 1:5and from Jesus 
Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the 
ruler of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loveth us, and loosed us from our 
sins by his blood; 1:6and he made us to be a kingdom, 
to be priests unto his God and Father; to him be the glory and the 
dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 1:7Behold, he cometh with the clouds; and 
every eye shall see him, and they that pierced him; and all the tribes of the 
earth shall mourn over him. Even so, Amen. 1:8I am the Alpha and 
the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the 
Almighty. 1:9I John, your brother and partaker with 
you in tribulation and kingdom and patience which are in Jesus, was in 
the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. 
1:10I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, 
and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet 1:11saying, What thou 
seest, write in a book and send it to the seven churches: unto Ephesus, 
and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamum, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto 
Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. 1:12And I turned to see the voice that 
spake with me. And having turned I saw seven golden candlesticks; 1:13and in the midst of the candlesticks 
one like unto a son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt 
about at the breasts with a golden girdle. 1:14And his head and 
his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; and his eyes were as a 
flame of fire; 1:15and his feet like unto burnished brass, 
as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many 
waters. 1:16And he had in his right hand seven 
stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his 
countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. 1:17And when I saw him, 
I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear 
not; I am the first and the last, 1:18and the Living one; and I was dead, and 
behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades. 1:19Write therefore the things which thou 
sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass 
hereafter; 1:20the mystery of the seven stars which 
thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars 
are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven 
churches. 

2:1To the angel of the church in Ephesus 
write: These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, he 
that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks: 2:2I know thy works, 
and thy toil and patience, and that thou canst not bear evil men, and didst try 
them that call themselves apostles, and they are not, and didst find them false; 
2:3and thou hast patience and didst bear 
for my name's sake, and hast not grown weary. 2:4But I have 
this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love. 2:5Remember therefore whence thou art 
fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I come to thee, and will move 
thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent. 2:6But this thou hast, 
that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. 2:7He 
that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him 
that overcometh, to him will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the 
Paradise of God. 2:8And to the angel of the church in Smyrna 
write: These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and lived 
again: 2:9I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty 
(but thou art rich), and the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and they 
art not, but are a synagogue of Satan. 2:10Fear not the things which thou art 
about to suffer: behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, 
that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful 
unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life. 2:11He that hath an 
ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. He that overcometh 
shall not be hurt of the second death. 2:12and to the angel of the church in 
Pergamum write: These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword: 2:13I 
know where thou dwellest, even where Satan's throne is; and thou holdest 
fast my name, and didst not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my 
witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwelleth. 2:14But I have a few things against thee, 
because thou hast there some that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak 
to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed 
to idols, and to commit fornication. 2:15So hast thou also some that hold the 
teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner. 2:16Repent therefore; 
or else I come to thee quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword 
of my mouth. 2:17He that hath an ear, let him hear what 
the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give of 
the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new 
name written, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it. 2:18And to the angel of 
the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his 
eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like unto burnished brass: 2:19I 
know thy works, and thy love and faith and ministry and patience, and that thy 
last works are more than the first. 2:20But I have this against thee, 
that thou sufferest the woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess; and she 
teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things 
sacrificed to idols. 2:21And I gave her time that she should 
repent; and she willeth not to repent of her fornication. 2:22Behold, I cast her 
into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, 
except they repent of her works. 2:23And I will kill her children with 
death; and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and 
hearts: and I will give unto each one of you according to your works. 2:24But to you I say, to the rest that are 
in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, who know not the deep things of 
Satan, as they are wont to say; I cast upon you none other burden. 2:25Nevertheless that which ye have, hold 
fast till I come. 2:26And he that overcometh, and he that 
keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations: 2:27and he shall rule them with a rod of 
iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers; as I also have 
received of my Father: 2:28and I will give him the morning star. 
2:29He that hath an ear, let him hear what 
the Spirit saith to the churches. 

3:1And to the angel of the church in Sardis 
write: These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven 
stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and thou art 
dead. 3:2Be thou watchful, and establish the 
things that remain, which were ready to die: for I have found no works of thine 
perfected before my God. 3:3Remember therefore how thou hast 
received and didst hear; and keep it, and repent. If therefore thou shalt 
not watch, I will come as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come 
upon thee. 3:4But thou hast a few names in Sardis that 
did not defile their garments: and they shall walk with me in white; for they 
are worthy. 3:5He that overcometh shall thus be arrayed 
in white garments; and I will in no wise blot his name out of the book of life, 
and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. 3:6He 
that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. 3:7And 
to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things saith he that is 
holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and none 
shall shut, and that shutteth and none openeth: 3:8I know thy works 
(behold, I have set before thee a door opened, which none can shut), that thou 
hast a little power, and didst keep my word, and didst not deny my name. 3:9Behold, I give of the synagogue of 
Satan, of them that say they are Jews, and they are not, but do lie; behold, I 
will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have 
loved thee. 3:10Because thou didst keep the word of my 
patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of trial, that hour which 
is to come upon the whole world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. 3:11I 
come quickly: hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy crown. 3:12He 
that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall 
go out thence no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the 
name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven 
from my God, and mine own new name. 3:13He that hath an ear, let him hear what 
the Spirit saith to the churches. 3:14And to the angel of the church in 
Laodicea write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the 
beginning of the creation of God: 3:15I know thy works, that thou art neither 
cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. 3:16So because thou art 
lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spew thee out of my mouth. 3:17Because thou sayest, I am rich, and 
have gotten riches, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art the 
wretched one and miserable and poor and blind and naked: 3:18I counsel thee to 
buy of me gold refined by fire, that thou mayest become rich; and white 
garments, that thou mayest clothe thyself, and that the shame of thy 
nakedness be not made manifest; and eyesalve to anoint thine eyes, that thou 
mayest see. 3:19As many as I love, I reprove and 
chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. 3:20Behold, I stand at 
the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in 
to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. 3:21He that overcometh, 
I will give to him to sit down with me in my throne, as I also overcame, and sat 
down with my Father in his throne. 3:22He that hath an ear, let him hear what 
the Spirit saith to the churches. 


4:1After these things I saw, and behold, a 
door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, a voice as of a 
trumpet speaking with me, one saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee the 
things which must come to pass hereafter. 4:2Straightway I was in the Spirit: and 
behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne; 4:3and 
he that sat was to look upon like a jasper stone and a sardius: and 
there was a rainbow round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon. 
4:4And round about the throne were 
four and twenty thrones: and upon the thrones I saw four and twenty 
elders sitting, arrayed in white garments; and on their heads crowns of gold. 4:5And 
out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders. And there 
was seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven 
Spirits of God; 4:6and before the throne, as it were a sea 
of glass like a crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the 
throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind. 4:7And the first 
creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the 
third creature had a face as of a man, and the fourth creature was like a 
flying eagle. 4:8and the four living creatures, having 
each one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and within: and they 
have no rest day and night, saying, 
Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is 
and who is to come. 
4:9And when the living creatures shall give 
glory and honor and thanks to him that sitteth on the throne, to him that liveth 
for ever and ever, 4:10the four and twenty elders shall fall 
down before him that sitteth on the throne, and shall worship him that liveth 
for ever and ever, and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 
4:11Worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, 
to receive the glory and the honor and the power: for thou didst create all 
things, and because of thy will they were, and were created. 


5:1And I saw in the right hand of him that 
sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven 
seals. 5:2And I saw a strong angel proclaiming 
with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals 
thereof? 5:3And no one in the heaven, or on the 
earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon. 5:4And 
I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look 
thereon: 5:5and one of the elders saith unto me, 
Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, 
hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof. 5:6And I saw in the 
midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the 
elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and 
seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. 
5:7And he came, and he taketh it out 
of the right hand of him that sat on the throne. 5:8And when he had 
taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell 
down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, 
which are the prayers of the saints. 5:9And they sing a new song, saying, 
Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou was 
slain, and didst purchase unto God with thy blood men of every tribe, and 
tongue, and people, and nation, 5:10and madest them to be unto our 
God a kingdom and priests; and they reign upon earth. 
5:11And I saw, and I heard a voice of many 
angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the 
number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; 
5:12saying with a great voice, 
Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain to receive the power, and riches, and 
wisdom, and might and honor, and glory, and blessing. 
5:13And every created thing which is in the 
heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things 
are in them, heard I saying, 
Unto him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, be the 
blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion, for ever and ever. 
5:14And the four living creatures said, 
Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped. 

6:1And I saw when the Lamb opened one of 
the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a 
voice of thunder, Come. 6:2And I saw, and behold, a white horse, 
and he that sat thereon had a bow; and there was given unto him a crown: and he 
came forth conquering, and to conquer. 6:3And when he opened the second seal, I 
heard the second living creature saying, Come. 6:4And another 
horse came forth, a red horse: and to him that sat thereon it was given 
to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another: and there 
was given unto him a great sword. 6:5And when he opened the third seal, I 
heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a black 
horse; and he that sat thereon had a balance in his hand. 6:6And I heard as it 
were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of 
wheat for a shilling, and three measures of barley for a shilling; and the oil 
and the wine hurt thou not. 6:7And when he opened the fourth seal, I 
heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come. 6:8And I saw, and 
behold, a pale horse: and he that sat upon him, his name was Death; and Hades 
followed with him. And there was given unto them authority over the fourth part 
of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the 
wild beasts of the earth. 6:9And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw 
underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, 
and for the testimony which they held: 6:10and they cried with a great voice, 
saying, How long, O Master, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge 
our blood on them that dwell on the earth? 6:11And there was given 
them to each one a white robe; and it was said unto them, that they should rest 
yet for a little time, until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, who 
should be killed even as they were, should have fulfilled their course. 
6:12And I saw when he opened the sixth 
seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of 
hair, and the whole moon became as blood; 6:13and the stars of 
the heaven fell unto the earth, as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs when she 
is shaken of a great wind. 6:14And the heaven was removed as a scroll 
when it is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their 
places. 6:15And the kings of the earth, and the 
princes, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman 
and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains; 6:16and they say to the mountains and to 
the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the 
throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: 6:17for the great day of their wrath is 
come; and who is able to stand? 

7:1After his I saw four angels standing at 
the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind 
should blow on the earth, or on the sea, or upon any tree. 7:2And I saw another 
angel ascend from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God: and he cried 
with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and 
the sea, 7:3saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the 
sea, nor the trees, till we shall have sealed the servants of our God on their 
foreheads. 7:4And I heard the number of them that were 
sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the 
children of Israel: 
 7:5Of the tribe of Judah were sealed 
twelve thousand: 
 Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand; 
 Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand; 
 7:6Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand; 
 Of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand; 
 Of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand; 
 7:7Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand; 
 Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand; 
 Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand; 
 7:8Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand; 

 Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand; 
 Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand. 
7:9After these things I saw, and behold, a 
great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of 
all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before 
the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands; 7:10and they cry with a 
great voice, saying, 
Salvation unto our God who sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb. 
7:11And all the angels were standing round 
about the throne, and about the elders and the four living creatures; and 
they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, 7:12saying, 
Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and 
power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. 
7:13And one of the elders answered, saying 
unto me, These that are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and whence came 
they? 7:14And I say unto him, My lord, thou 
knowest. And he said to me, These are they that come of the great tribulation, 
and they washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 7:15Therefore are they before the throne of 
God; and they serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the 
throne shall spread his tabernacle over them. 7:16They shall hunger 
no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun strike upon them, nor 
any heat: 7:17for the Lamb that is in the midst of 
the throne shall be their shepherd, and shall guide them unto fountains of 
waters of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes. 

8:1And when he opened the seventh seal, 
there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. 8:2And 
I saw the seven angels that stand before God; and there were given unto them 
seven trumpets. 8:3And another angel came and stood over 
the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, 
that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar 
which was before the throne. 8:4And the smoke of the incense, with the 
prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand. 8:5And 
the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and 
cast it upon the earth: and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, 
and an earthquake. 8:6And the seven angels that had the seven 
trumpets prepared themselves to sound. 8:7And the first sounded, and there 
followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: 
and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees 
was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. 8:8And the second angel 
sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the 
sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; 8:9and there died the 
third part of the creatures which were in the sea, even they that had 
life; and the third part of the ships was destroyed. 8:10And the third angel 
sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it 
fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters; 8:11and the name of the star is called 
Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of 
the waters, because they were made bitter. 8:12And the fourth 
angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of 
the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be 
darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night 
in like manner. 8:13And I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying 
in mid heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, for them that dwell on 
the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who 
are yet to sound. 

9:1And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a 
star from heaven fallen unto the earth: and there was given to him the key of 
the pit of the abyss. 9:2And he opened the pit of the abyss; and 
there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the 
sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. 9:3And 
out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given them, as 
the scorpions of the earth have power. 9:4And it was said unto them that they 
should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any 
tree, but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads. 9:5And 
it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be 
tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when 
it striketh a man. 9:6And in those days men shall seek death, 
and shall in no wise find it; and they shall desire to die, and death fleeth 
from them. 9:7And the shapes of the locusts were like 
unto horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto 
gold, and their faces were as men's faces. 9:8And they had hair as 
the hair of women, and their teeth were as teeth of lions. 9:9And 
they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their 
wings was as the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to war. 9:10And they have tails like unto 
scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five 
months. 9:11They have over them as king the angel 
of the abyss: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek tongue he 
hath the name Apollyon. 9:12The first Woe is past: behold, there 
come yet two Woes hereafter. 9:13And the sixth angel sounded, and I 
heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God, 9:14one saying to the sixth angel that had 
one trumpet, Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates. 
9:15And the four angels were loosed, that 
had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill 
the third part of men. 9:16And the number of the armies of the 
horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: I heard the number of them. 
9:17And thus I saw the horses in the 
vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates as of fire and of 
hyacinth and of brimstone: and the heads of lions; and out of their mouths 
proceedeth fire and smoke and brimstone. 9:18By these three plagues was the third 
part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which proceeded 
out of their mouths. 9:19For the power of the horses is in their 
mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like unto serpents, and have 
heads; and with them they hurt. 9:20And the rest of mankind, who were not 
killed with these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they 
should not worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, 
and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk: 9:21and they repented not of their murders, 
nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. 

10:1And I saw another strong angel coming 
down out of heaven, arrayed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and 
his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire; 10:2and he had in his 
hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left 
upon the earth; 10:3and he cried with a great voice, as a 
lion roareth: and when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices. 10:4And when the seven thunders uttered 
their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven 
saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. 
10:5And the angel that I saw standing upon 
the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven, 10:6and sware by him that liveth for ever 
and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth 
and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, 
that there shall be delay no longer: 10:7but in the days of the voice of the 
seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then is finished they mystery of God, 
according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets. 10:8And the voice which I heard from 
heaven, I heard it again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the book 
which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the 
earth. 10:9And I went unto the angel, saying unto 
him that he should give me the little book. And he saith unto me, Take it, and 
eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be 
sweet as honey. 10:10And I took the little book out of the 
angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and when I 
had eaten it, my belly was made bitter. 10:11And they say unto me, Thou must 
prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings. 

11:1And there was given me a reed like unto 
a rod: and one said, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and 
them that worship therein. 11:2And the court which is without the 
temple leave without, and measure it not; for it hath been given unto the 
nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months. 11:3And I will give unto my two witnesses, 
and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in 
sackcloth. 11:4These are the two olive trees and the 
two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth. 11:5And if any man 
desireth to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their 
enemies; and if any man shall desire to hurt them, in this manner must he be 
killed. 11:6These have the power to shut the 
heaven, that it rain not during the days of their prophecy: and they have power 
over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every 
plague, as often as they shall desire. 11:7And when they shall have finished their 
testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, 
and overcome them, and kill them. 11:8And their dead bodies lie in the 
street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where 
also their Lord was crucified. 11:9And from among the peoples and tribes 
and tongues and nations do men look upon their dead bodies three days and 
a half, and suffer not their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb. 11:10And they that dwell on the earth 
rejoice over them, and make merry; and they shall send gifts one to another; 
because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth. 11:11And after the three days and a half 
the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; 
and great fear fell upon them that beheld them. 11:12And they heard a 
great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they went up into 
heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them. 11:13And in that hour 
there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there 
were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were 
affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. 11:14The second Woe is 
past: behold, the third Woe cometh quickly. 11:15And the seventh 
angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, 
The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his 
Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever. 
11:16And the four and twenty elders, who 
sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God, 11:17saying, 
We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who wast; because 
thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign. 11:18And the nations 
were wroth, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and 
the time to give their reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the 
saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy 
them that destroy the earth. 
11:19And there was opened the temple of God 
that is in heaven; and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant; and 
there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and 
great hail. 

12:1And a great sign was seen in heaven: a 
woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a 
crown of twelve stars; 12:2and she was the child; and she crieth 
out, travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered. 12:3And there was seen 
another sign in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and 
ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems. 12:4And his tail 
draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: 
and the dragon standeth before the woman that is about to be delivered, that 
when she is delivered he may devour her child. 12:5And she was 
delivered of a son, a man child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of 
iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and unto his throne. 12:6And the woman fled into the wilderness, 
where she hath a place prepared of God, that there they may nourish her a 
thousand two hundred and threescore days. 12:7And there was war 
in heaven: Michael and his angels going forth to war with the dragon; and 
the dragon warred and his angels; 12:8And they prevailed not, neither was 
their place found any more in heaven. 12:9And the great dragon was cast down, the 
old serpent, he that is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole 
world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him. 12:10And I heard a great voice in heaven, 
saying, 
Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the 
authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who 
accuseth them before our God day and night. 12:11And they overcame 
him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their 
testimony; and they loved not their life even unto death. 12:12Therefore rejoice, 
O heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe for the earth and for the sea: because 
the devil is gone down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a 
short time. 
12:13And when the dragon saw that he was 
cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the man 
child. 12:14And there were given to the woman the 
two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness unto her 
place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the 
face of the serpent. 12:15And the serpent cast out of his mouth 
after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by 
the stream. 12:16And the earth helped the woman, and 
the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out 
of his mouth. 12:17And the dragon waxed wroth with the 
woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, that keep the 
commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus: 

13:1and he stood upon the sand of the sea. 
And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns, and seven heads, 
and on his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy. 13:2And the beast which I saw was like unto 
a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the 
mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great 
authority. 13:3And I saw one of his heads as 
though it had been smitten unto death; and his death-stroke was healed: and the 
whole earth wondered after the beast; 13:4and they worshipped the dragon, because 
he gave his authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who 
is like unto the beast? And who is able to war with him? 13:5and there was given 
to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to him 
authority to continue forty and two months. 13:6And he opened his 
mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, 
even them that dwell in the heaven. 13:7And it was given 
unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given 
to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation. 13:8And all that dwell on the earth shall 
worship him, every one whose name hath not been written from the 
foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that hath been slain. 13:9If 
any man hath an ear, let him hear. 13:10If any man is for captivity, 
into captivity he goeth: if any man shall kill with the sword, with the sword 
must he be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. 13:11And I saw another beast coming up out 
of the earth; and he had two horns like unto lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 13:12And he exerciseth all the authority of 
the first beast in his sight. And he maketh the earth and them dwell therein to 
worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed. 13:13And he doeth great 
signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth 
in the sight of men. 13:14And he deceiveth them that dwell on 
the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of 
the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an 
image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived. 13:15And it was given unto him to 
give breath to it, even to the image to the breast, that the image of the 
beast should both speak, and cause that as many as should not worship the image 
of the beast should be killed. 13:16And he causeth all, the small and the 
great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that there be given 
them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead; 13:17and that no man 
should be able to buy or to sell, save he that hath the mark, even the 
name of the beast or the number of his name. 13:18Here is wisdom. He 
that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the 
number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty and six. 

14:1And I saw, and behold, the Lamb 
standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, 
having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads. 14:2And I heard a voice from heaven, as the 
voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I 
heard was as the voice of harpers harping with their harps: 14:3and they sing as it were a new song 
before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no 
man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, 
even they that had been purchased out of the earth. 14:4These are they that 
were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they that 
follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, 
to be the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb. 14:5And in their mouth 
was found no lie: they are without blemish. 14:6And I saw another 
angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them 
that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people; 
14:7and he saith with a great voice, Fear 
God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him 
that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters. 14:8And another, a second angel, followed, 
saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to 
drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. 14:9And another angel, 
a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the 
beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand, 14:10he also shall drink of the wine of the 
wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be 
tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the 
presence of the Lamb: 14:11and the smoke of their torment goeth 
up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the 
beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name. 14:12Here is the patience of the saints, 
they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. 14:13And I heard the voice from heaven 
saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, 
saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow 
with them. 14:14And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; 
and on the cloud I saw one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his 
head a golden crown, and in his hand sharp sickle. 14:15And another angel 
came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the 
cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the 
harvest of the earth is ripe. 14:16And he that sat on the cloud cast his 
sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped. 14:17Another angel came 
out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. 14:18And another angel came out from the 
altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him 
that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the 
clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. 14:19And the angel cast his sickle into the 
earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, 
the great winepress, of the wrath of God. 14:20And the winepress 
are trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even 
unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs. 

15:1And I saw another sign in heaven, great 
and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues, which are the last, 
for in them is finished the wrath of God. 15:2And I saw as it 
were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from 
the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the 
sea of glass, having harps of God. 15:3And they sing the song of Moses the 
servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, 
Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and 
true are thy ways, thou King of the ages. 15:4Who shall not fear, 
O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall 
come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest. 
15:5And after these things I saw, and the 
temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 15:6and there came out from the temple the 
seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with precious stone, 
pure and bright, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles. 15:7And one of the four living creatures 
gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who 
liveth for ever and ever. 15:8And the temple was filled with smoke 
from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the 
temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished. 

16:1And I heard a great voice out of the 
temple, saying to the seven angels, Go ye, and pour out the seven bowls of the 
wrath of God into the earth. 16:2And the first went, and poured out his 
bowl into the earth; and it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that 
had the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image. 16:3And the second 
poured out his bowl into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and 
every living soul died, even the things that were in the sea. 16:4And the third poured out his bowl into 
the rivers and the fountains of the waters; and it became blood. 16:5And I heard the angel of the waters 
saying, Righteous art thou, who art and who wast, thou Holy One, because thou 
didst thus judge: 16:6for they poured out the blood of the 
saints and the prophets, and blood hast thou given them to drink: they are 
worthy. 16:7And I heard the altar saying, Yea, O 
Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments. 16:8And the fourth poured out his bowl upon 
the sun; and it was given unto it to scorch men with fire. 16:9And men were 
scorched men with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God who hath the 
power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory. 16:10And the fifth poured out his bowl upon 
the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they gnawed their 
tongues for pain, 16:11and they blasphemed the God of heaven 
because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works. 16:12And the sixth poured out his bowl upon 
the great river, the river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, 
that the way might by made ready for the kings that come from the 
sunrising. 16:13And I saw coming out of the 
mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of 
the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs: 16:14for they are 
spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole 
world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the 
Almighty. 16:15(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is 
he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walked naked, and they see 
his shame.) 16:16And they gathered them together into 
the place which is called in Hebrew Har-magedon. 16:17And the seventh 
poured out his bowl upon the air; and there came forth a great voice out of the 
temple, from the throne, saying, It is done: 16:18and there were 
lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as 
was not since there were men upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty. 
16:19And the great city was divided into 
three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great was 
remembered in the sight of God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the 
fierceness of his wrath. 16:20And every island fled away, and the 
mountains were not found. 16:21And great hail, every stone 
about the weight of a talent, cometh down out of heaven upon men: and men 
blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof is 
exceeding great. 

17:1And there came one of the seven angels 
that had the seven bowls, and spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show 
thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters; 17:2with whom the kings of the earth 
committed fornication, and they that dwell in the earth were made drunken with 
the wine of her fornication. 17:3And he carried me away in the Spirit 
into a wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full 
of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 17:4And the woman was 
arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and 
pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean 
things of her fornication, 17:5and upon her forehead a name written, 
MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF 
THE EARTH. 17:6And I saw the woman drunken with the 
blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw 
her, I wondered with a great wonder. 17:7And the angel said unto me, Wherefore 
didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast 
that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns. 17:8The beast that thou sawest was, and is 
not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition. And 
they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, they whose name hath not been 
written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold 
the beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall come. 17:9Here is the mind 
that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman 
sitteth: 17:10and they are seven kings; the five are 
fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must 
continue a little while. 17:11And the beast that was, and is not, is 
himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition. 17:12And the ten horns that thou sawest are 
ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as 
kings, with the beast, for one hour. 17:13These have one mind, and they give 
their power and authority unto the beast. 17:14These shall war 
against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and 
King of kings; and they also shall overcome that are with him, called and 
chosen and faithful. 17:15And he saith unto me, The waters which 
thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, 
and tongues. 17:16And the ten horns which thou sawest, 
and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and 
naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire. 17:17For God did put in their hearts to do 
his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, 
until the words of God should be accomplished. 17:18And the woman whom 
thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth. 

18:1After these things I saw another angel 
coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lightened 
with his glory. 18:2And he cried with a mighty voice, 
saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of 
demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and 
hateful bird. 18:3For by the wine of the wrath of her 
fornication all the nations are fallen; and the kings of the earth committed 
fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth waxed rich by the power of 
her wantonness. 18:4And I heard another voice from heaven, 
saying, Come forth, my people, out of her, that ye have no fellowship with her 
sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: 18:5for her sins have 
reached even unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. 18:6Render unto her even as she rendered, 
and double unto her the double according to her works: in the cup which 
she mingled, mingle unto her double. 18:7How much soever she glorified herself, 
and waxed wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning: for she saith in her 
heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall in no wise see mourning. 18:8Therefore in one day shall her plagues 
come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with 
fire; for strong is the Lord God who judged her. 18:9And the kings of 
the earth, who committed fornication and lived wantonly with her, shall weep and 
wail over her, when they look upon the smoke of her burning, 18:10standing afar off for the fear of her 
torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! for in one 
hour is thy judgment come. 18:11And the merchants of the earth weep 
and mourn over her, for no man buyeth their merchandise any more; 18:12merchandise of gold, and silver, and 
precious stone, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet; 
and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel made of most 
precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble; 18:13and cinnamon, and 
spice, and incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine 
flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and merchandise of horses and 
chariots and slaves; and souls of men. 18:14And the fruits which thy soul lusted 
after are gone from thee, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous are 
perished from thee, and men shall find them no more at all. 18:15The merchants of these things, who 
were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping 
and mourning; 18:16saying, Woe, woe, the great city, she 
that was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and 
precious stone and pearl! 18:17for in an hour so great riches is made 
desolate. And every shipmaster, and every one that saileth any wither, and 
mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood afar off, 18:18and cried out as they looked upon the 
smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like the great city? 18:19And they cast dust on their heads, and 
cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, wherein all that 
had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her costliness! for in 
one hour is she made desolate. 18:20Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye 
saints, and ye apostles, and ye prophets; for God hath judged your judgment on 
her. 18:21And a strong angel took up a stone as 
it were a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty 
fall shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and shall be found no more at 
all. 18:22And the voice of harpers and minstrels 
and flute-players and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no 
craftsman, of whatsoever craft, shall be found any more at all in thee; and the 
voice of a mill shall be heard no more at all in thee; 18:23and the light of a 
lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of 
the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the 
princes of the earth; for with thy sorcery were all the nations deceived. 18:24And in her was found the blood of 
prophets and of saints, and of all that have been slain upon the earth. 

19:1After these things I heard as it were a 
great voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, 
Hallelujah; Salvation, and glory, and power, belong to our God: 19:2for true and righteous are his 
judgments; for he hath judged the great harlot, her that corrupted the earth 
with her fornication, and he hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. 

19:3And a second time they say, Hallelujah. 
And her smoke goeth up for ever and ever. 19:4And the four and 
twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that 
sitteth on the throne, saying, Amen; Hallelujah. 19:5And a voice came 
forth from the throne, saying, 
Give praise to our God, all ye his servants, ye that fear him, the small and 
the great. 
19:6And I heard as it were the voice of a 
great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty 
thunders, saying, 
Hallelujah: for the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigneth. 19:7Let us rejoice and 
be exceeding glad, and let us give the glory unto him: for the marriage of the 
Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. 19:8And it was given 
unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright and pure: 
for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. 
19:9And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed 
are they that are bidden to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto 
me, These are true words of God. 19:10And I fell down before his feet to 
worship him. And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant 
with thee and with thy brethren that hold the testimony of Jesus: worship God; 
for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. 19:11And I saw the 
heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon called 
Faithful and True; and in righteous he doth judge and make war. 19:12And his eyes are a flame of 
fire, and upon his head are many diadems; and he hath a name written 
which no one knoweth but he himself. 19:13And he is arrayed in a garment 
sprinkled with blood: and his name is called The Word of God. 19:14And the armies which are in heaven 
followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and pure. 19:15And out of his mouth proceedeth a 
sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them 
with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath 
of God, the Almighty. 19:16And he hath on his garment and on his 
thigh a name written, KINGS OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. 19:17And I saw an angel 
standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds 
that fly in mid heaven, Come and be gathered together unto the great 
supper of God; 19:18that ye may eat the flesh of kings, 
and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses 
and of them that sit thereon, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, and 
small and great. 19:19And I saw the beast, and the kings of 
the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat 
upon the horse, and against his army. 19:20And the beast was taken, and with him 
the false prophet that wrought the signs in his sight, wherewith he deceived 
them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image: 
they two were cast alive into the lake of fire that burneth with brimstone: 19:21and the rest were killed with the 
sword of him that sat upon the horse, even the sword which came forth out 
of his mouth: and all the birds were filled with their flesh. 

20:1And I saw an angel coming down out of 
heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. 20:2And he laid hold on the dragon, the old 
serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, 20:3and cast him into the abyss, and shut 
it, and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no 
more, until the thousand years should be finished: after this he must be loosed 
for a little time. 20:4And I saw thrones, and they sat upon 
them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that 
had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such 
as worshipped not the beast, neither his image, and received not the mark upon 
their forehead and upon their hand; and they lived, and reigned with Christ a 
thousand years. 20:5The rest of the dead lived not until 
the thousand years should be finished. This is the first resurrection. 20:6Blessed and holy is he that hath part 
in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they 
shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand 
years. 20:7And when the thousand years are 
finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, 20:8and shall come 
forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and 
Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of 
the sea. 20:9And they went up over the breadth of 
the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and 
fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them. 20:10And the devil that 
deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the 
beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever 
and ever. 20:11And I saw a great white throne, and 
him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and 
there was found no place for them. 20:12And I saw the dead, the great and the 
small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was 
opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of the 
things which were written in the books, according to their works. 20:13And the sea gave up the dead that were 
in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were 
judged every man according to their works. 20:14And death and 
Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, even the 
lake of fire. 20:15And if any was not found written in 
the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire. 

21:1And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: 
for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away; and the sea is no 
more. 21:2And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, 
coming down out of heaven of God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband. 
21:3And I heard a great voice out of the 
throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell 
with them, and they shall be his peoples, and God himself shall be with them, 
and be their God: 21:4and he shall wipe away every tear from 
their eyes; and death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor 
crying, nor pain, any more: the first things are passed away. 21:5And he that sitteth on the throne said, 
Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful 
and true. 21:6And he said unto me, They are come to 
pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto 
him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. 21:7He 
that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall 
be my son. 21:8But for the fearful, and unbelieving, 
and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, 
and all liars, their part shall be in the lake that burneth with fire and 
brimstone; which is the second death. 21:9And there came one of the seven angels 
who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues; and he 
spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the 
Lamb. 21:10And he carried me away in the Spirit 
to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down 
out of heaven from God, 21:11having the glory of God: her light was 
like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal: 21:12having a wall great and high; having 
twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, which 
are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: 21:13on the east were three gates; and on 
the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three 
gates. 21:14And the wall of the city had twelve 
foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 21:15And he that spake with me had for a 
measure a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall 
thereof. 21:16And the city lieth foursquare, and the 
length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the 
reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height 
thereof are equal. 21:17And he measured the wall thereof, a 
hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, 
that is, of an angel. 21:18And the building of the wall thereof 
was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass. 21:19The foundations of the wall of the 
city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was 
jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 21:20the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, 
sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the 
tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. 21:21And the twelve gates were twelve 
pearls; each one of the several gates was of one pearl: and the street of the 
city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. 21:22And I saw no 
temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple 
thereof. 21:23And the city hath no need of the sun, 
neither of the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and 
the lamp thereof is the Lamb. 21:24And the nations shall walk amidst the 
light thereof: and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it. 21:25And the gates thereof shall in no wise 
be shut by day (for there shall be no night there): 21:26and they shall 
bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it: 21:27and there shall in 
no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a 
lie: but only they that are written in the Lamb's book of life. 

22:1And he showed me a river of water of 
life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, 22:2in 
the midst of the street thereof. And on this side of the river and on that was 
the tree of life, bearing twelve manner of fruits, yielding its fruit 
every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 22:3And there shall be no curse any more: 
and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be therein: and his servants shall 
serve him; 22:4and they shall see his face; and his 
name shall be on their foreheads. 22:5And there shall be night no more; and 
they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun; for the Lord God shall give 
them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever. 22:6And he said unto 
me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord, the God of the spirits of 
the prophets, sent his angels to show unto his servants the things which must 
shortly come to pass. 22:7And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is 
he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book. 22:8And I John am he 
that heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to 
worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things. 22:9And he saith unto me, See thou do it 
not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets, and 
with them that keep the words of this book: worship God. 22:10And he saith unto 
me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand. 
22:11He that is unrighteous, let him do 
unrighteousness still: and he that is filthy, let him be made filthy still: and 
he that is righteous, let him do righteousness still: and he that is holy, let 
him be made holy still. 22:12Behold, I come quickly; and my reward 
is with me, to render to each man according as his work is. 22:13I am the Alpha and 
the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. 22:14Blessed are they that wash their 
robes, that they may have the right to come to the tree of life, and my 
enter in by the gates into the city. 22:15Without are the dogs, and the 
sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every 
one that loveth and maketh a lie. 22:16I Jesus have sent mine angel to 
testify unto you these things for the churches. I am the root and the offspring 
of David, the bright, the morning star. 22:17And the Spirit and the bride say, 
Come. And he that heareth, let him say, Come. And he that is athirst, let him 
come: he that will, let him take the water of life freely. 22:18I testify unto 
every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall 
add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this 
book: 22:19and if any man shall take away from 
the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the 
tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book. 22:20He who testifieth these things saith, 
Yea: I come quickly. Amen: come, Lord Jesus. 22:21The grace of the 
Lord Jesus be with the saints. Amen.
