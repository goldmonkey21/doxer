The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians

1:1Paul, called to be an apostle of 
Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, 1:2unto 
the church of God which is at Corinth, even them that are sanctified in 
Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that call upon the name of 
our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their Lord and ours: 1:3Grace to you and peace from God our 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 1:4I thank my God always concerning you, 
for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus; 1:5that in everything 
ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge; 1:6even as the 
testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: 1:7so that ye come behind in no gift; 
waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; 1:8who shall also 
confirm you unto the end, that ye be unreproveable in the day of our Lord 
Jesus Christ. 1:9God is faithful, through whom ye were 
called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. 1:10Now I beseech you, 
brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same 
thing and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be 
perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment. 1:11For it hath been signified unto me 
concerning you, my brethren, by them that are of the household of Chloe, 
that there are contentions among you. 1:12Now this I mean, that each one of you 
saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos: and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. 1:13Is 
Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of 
Paul? 1:14I thank God that I baptized none of 
you, save Crispus and Gaius; 1:15lest any man should say that ye were 
baptized into my name. 1:16And I baptized also the household of 
Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. 1:17For Christ sent me 
not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross 
of Christ should be made void. 1:18For the word of the cross is to them 
that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God. 1:19For it is written, 
 I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, 
 And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought. 
1:20Where is the wise? where is the scribe? 
where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the 
world? 1:21For seeing that in the wisdom of God 
the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God's good pleasure through 
the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe. 1:22Seeing that Jews 
ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom: 1:23but we preach 
Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness; 1:24but unto them that are called, both 
Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. 1:25Because the foolishness of God is wiser 
than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. 1:26For behold your 
calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many 
noble, are called: 1:27but God chose the foolish things of the 
world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak 
things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong; 1:28and the base things of the world, and 
the things that are despised, did God choose, yea and the things that are 
not, that he might bring to nought the things that are: 1:29that no flesh 
should glory before God. 1:30But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who 
was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and 
redemption: 1:31that, according as it is written, He 
that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 

2:1And I, brethren, when I came unto you, 
came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the 
testimony of God. 2:2For I determined not to know anything 
among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. 2:3And I was with you 
in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. 2:4And my speech and my 
preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the 
Spirit and of power: 2:5that your faith should not stand in the 
wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 2:6We speak wisdom, however, among them 
that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this 
world, who are coming to nought: 2:7but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, 
even the wisdom that hath been hidden, which God foreordained 
before the worlds unto our glory: 2:8which none of the rulers of this world 
hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of 
glory: 2:9but as it is written, 
 Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, 
 And which entered not into the heart of man, 
 Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him. 
2:10But unto us God revealed them 
through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of 
God. 2:11For who among men knoweth the things of 
a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God 
none knoweth, save the Spirit of God. 2:12But we received, not the spirit of the 
world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were 
freely given to us of God. 2:13Which things also we speak, not in 
words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining 
spiritual things with spiritual words. 2:14Now the natural man 
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto 
him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged. 2:15But he that is spiritual judgeth all 
things, and he himself is judged of no man. 2:16For who hath known 
the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of 
Christ. 

3:1And I, brethren, could not speak unto 
you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ. 3:2I 
fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able to bear it: 
nay, not even now are ye able; 3:3for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there 
is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after 
the manner of men? 3:4For when one saith, I am of Paul; and 
another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men? 3:5What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? 
Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him. 3:6I 
planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. 3:7So then neither is 
he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the 
increase. 3:8Now he that planteth and he that 
watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own 
labor. 3:9For we are God's fellow-workers: ye are 
God's husbandry, God's building. 3:10According to the grace of God which was 
given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth 
thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon. 3:11For other 
foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 3:12But if any man buildeth on the 
foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble; 3:13each man's work 
shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in 
fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man's work of what sort it is. 3:14If 
any man's work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward. 3:15If 
any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be 
saved; yet so as through fire. 3:16Know ye not that ye are a temple of 
God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 3:17If any man 
destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is 
holy, and such are ye. 3:18Let no man deceive himself. If any man 
thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he 
may become wise. 3:19For the wisdom of this world is 
foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their 
craftiness: 3:20and again, The Lord knoweth the 
reasonings of the wise that they are vain. 3:21Wherefore let no 
one glory in men. For all things are yours; 3:22whether Paul, or 
Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or 
things to come; all are yours; 3:23and ye are Christ's; and Christ is 
God's. 


4:1Let a man so account of us, as of 
ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. 4:2Here, moreover, it 
is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 4:3But with me it is a 
very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I 
judge not mine own self. 4:4For I know nothing against myself; yet 
am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. 4:5Wherefore judge nothing before the time, 
until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, 
and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his 
praise from God. 4:6Now these things, brethren, I have in a 
figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye might 
learn not to go beyond the things which are written; that no one of you 
be puffed up for the one against the other. 4:7For who maketh thee 
to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst 
receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it? 4:8Already are ye filled, already ye are 
become rich, ye have come to reign without us: yea and I would that ye did 
reign, that we also might reign with you. 4:9For, I think, God hath set forth us the 
apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto 
the world, both to angels and men. 4:10We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye 
are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but we have 
dishonor. 4:11Even unto this present hour we both 
hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain 
dwelling-place; 4:12and we toil, working with our own 
hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure; 4:13being defamed, we 
entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, 
even until now. 4:14I write not these things to shame you, 
but to admonish you as my beloved children. 4:15For though ye have 
ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers; for in 
Christ Jesus I begat you through the gospel. 4:16I beseech you 
therefore, be ye imitators of me. 4:17For this cause have I sent unto you 
Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in 
remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every 
church. 4:18Now some are puffed up, as though I 
were not coming to you. 4:19But I will come to you shortly, if the 
Lord will; and I will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but the 
power. 4:20For the kingdom of God is not in word, 
but in power. 4:21What will ye? shall I come unto you 
with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness? 


5:1It is actually reported that there is 
fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, 
that one of you hath his father's wife. 5:2And ye are puffed 
up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken 
away from among you. 5:3For I verily, being absent in body but 
present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so 
wrought this thing, 5:4in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being 
gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 5:5to 
deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit 
may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 5:6Your glorying is not 
good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 5:7Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be 
a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been 
sacrificed, even Christ: 5:8wherefore let us keep the feast, not 
with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the 
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 5:9I wrote unto you in my epistle to have 
no company with fornicators; 5:10not at all meaning with the 
fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with 
idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world: 5:11but as it is, I 
wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a 
fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an 
extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat. 5:12For what have I to 
do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within? 5:13But them that are without God judgeth. 
Put away the wicked man from among yourselves. 

6:1Dare any of you, having a matter against 
his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? 6:2Or 
know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by 
you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 6:3Know ye not that we 
shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life? 6:4If 
then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge 
who are of no account in the church? 6:5I say this to move you to shame. 
What, cannot there be found among you one wise man who shall be able to 
decide between his brethren, 6:6but brother goeth to law with brother, 
and that before unbelievers? 6:7Nay, already it is altogether a defect 
in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why 
not rather be defrauded? 6:8Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and 
defraud, and that your brethren. 6:9Or know ye not that the unrighteous 
shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor 
idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, 
6:10nor thieves, nor covetous, nor 
drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 6:11And such were some of you: but ye were 
washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God. 6:12All things are 
lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; 
but I will not be brought under the power of any. 6:13Meats for the 
belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. 
But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the 
body: 6:14and God both raised the Lord, and will 
raise up as through his power. 6:15Know ye not that your bodies are 
members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them 
members of a harlot? God forbid. 6:16Or know ye not that he that is joined 
to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh. 6:17But he that is joined unto the Lord is 
one spirit. 6:18Flee fornication. Every sin that a man 
doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against 
his own body. 6:19Or know ye not that your body is a 
temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are 
not your own; 6:20for ye were bought with a price: 
glorify God therefore in your body. 

7:1Now concerning the things whereof ye 
wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. 7:2But, because of 
fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own 
husband. 7:3Let the husband render unto the wife her 
due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. 7:4The wife hath not 
power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not 
power over his own body, but the wife. 7:5Defraud ye not one the other, except it 
be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be 
together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency. 7:6But 
this I say by way of concession, not of commandment. 7:7Yet I would that all 
men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one 
after this manner, and another after that. 7:8But I say to the 
unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. 7:9But 
if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to 
burn. 7:10But unto the married I give charge, 
yea not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband 7:11(but should she depart, let her remain 
unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not 
his wife. 7:12But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If 
any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let 
him not leave her. 7:13And the woman that hath an unbelieving 
husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband. 7:14For the unbelieving husband is 
sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: 
else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. 7:15Yet if the 
unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under 
bondage in such cases: but God hath called us in peace. 7:16For how knowest thou, O wife, whether 
thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt 
save thy wife? 7:17Only, as the Lord hath distributed to 
each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the 
churches. 7:18Was any man called being circumcised? 
Let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? Let 
him not be circumcised. 7:19Circumcision is nothing, and 
uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God. 7:20Let each man abide in that calling 
wherein he was called. 7:21Wast thou called being a bondservant? 
Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use it rather. 7:22For he that was called in the Lord 
being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise he that was called being 
free, is Christ's bondservant. 7:23Ye were bought with a price; become not 
bondservants of men. 7:24Brethren, let each man, wherein he was 
called, therein abide with God. 7:25Now concerning virgins I have no 
commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy 
of the Lord to be trustworthy. 7:26I think therefore that this is good by 
reason of the distress that is upon us, namely, that it is good for a man 
to be as he is. 7:27Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to 
be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife. 7:28But shouldest thou 
marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet 
such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you. 7:29But this I say, brethren, the time is 
shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had 
none; 7:30and those that weep, as though they 
wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that 
buy, as though they possessed not; 7:31and those that use the world, as not 
using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away. 7:32But I would have you to be free from 
cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may 
please the Lord: 7:33but he that is married is careful for 
the things of the world, how he may please his wife, 7:34and is divided. 
So also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the 
things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she 
that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her 
husband. 7:35And this I say for your own profit; not 
that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may 
attend upon the Lord without distraction. 7:36But if any man 
thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin daughter, if 
she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he 
will; he sinneth not; let them marry. 7:37But he that standeth stedfast in his 
heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep 
his own virgin daughter, shall do well. 7:38So then both he 
that giveth his own virgin daughter in marriage doeth well; and he that 
giveth her not in marriage shall do better. 7:39A wife is bound for 
so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to 
be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. 7:40But she is happier 
if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the 
Spirit of God. 

8:1Now concerning things sacrificed to 
idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love 
edifieth. 8:2If any man thinketh that he knoweth 
anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know; 8:3but if any man 
loveth God, the same is known by him. 8:4Concerning therefore the eating of 
things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the 
world, and that there is no God but one. 8:5For though there be that are called 
gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many; 8:6yet 
to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and 
one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him. 8:7Howbeit there is not in all men that 
knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as of a thing 
sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. 8:8But 
food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, 
if we eat, are we the better. 8:9But take heed lest by any means this 
liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak. 8:10For if a man see 
thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol's temple, will not his 
conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? 8:11For through thy knowledge he that is 
weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died. 8:12And thus, sinning 
against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin 
against Christ. 8:13Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother 
to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to 
stumble. 

9:1Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have 
I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord? 9:2If to others I am 
not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are 
ye in the Lord. 9:3My defence to them that examine me is 
this. 9:4Have we no right to eat and to drink? 9:5Have 
we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the 
apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 9:6Or I only and 
Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working? 9:7What soldier ever 
serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit 
thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? 9:8Do I 
speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same? 
9:9For it is written in the law of Moses, 
Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen 
that God careth, 9:10or saith he it assuredly for our sake? 
Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, 
and he that thresheth, to thresh in hope of partaking. 9:11If 
we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your 
carnal things? 9:12If others partake of this right 
over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we 
bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ. 9:13Know ye not that they that minister 
about sacred things eat of the things of the temple, and they that 
wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar? 9:14Even so did the 
Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel. 9:15But I have used none of these things: 
and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for it 
were good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorifying 
void. 9:16For if I preach the gospel, I have 
nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I 
preach not the gospel. 9:17For if I do this of mine own will, I 
have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to 
me. 9:18What then is my reward? That, when I 
preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the 
full my right in the gospel. 9:19For though I was free from all 
men, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more. 
9:20And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that 
I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being 
myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; 9:21to 
them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but 
under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law. 9:22To 
the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to 
all men, that I may by all means save some. 9:23And I do all things 
for the gospel's sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof. 9:24Know ye not that they that run in a 
race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain. 9:25And every man that striveth in the 
games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a 
corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. 9:26I therefore so run, 
as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air: 9:27but I buffet my 
body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached 
to others, I myself should be rejected. 

10:1For I would not, brethren, have you 
ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the 
sea; 10:2and were all baptized unto Moses in the 
cloud and in the sea; 10:3and did all eat the same spiritual 
food; 10:4and did all drink the same spiritual 
drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was 
Christ. 10:5Howbeit with most of them God was not 
well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. 10:6Now these things 
were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they 
also lusted. 10:7Neither be ye idolaters, as were some 
of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to 
play. 10:8Neither let us commit fornication, as 
some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. 10:9Neither let us make trial of the Lord, 
as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents. 10:10Neither murmur ye, 
as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer. 10:11Now these things 
happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, 
upon whom the ends of the ages are come. 10:12Wherefore let him 
that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. 10:13There hath no 
temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not 
suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation 
make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it. 10:14Wherefore, my beloved, flee from 
idolatry. 10:15I speak as to wise men; judge ye what 
I say. 10:16The cup of blessing which we bless, is 
it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a 
communion of the body of Christ? 10:17seeing that we, who are many, are one 
bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread. 10:18Behold Israel 
after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar? 
10:19What say I then? that a thing 
sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? 10:20But I say, that the things 
which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I 
would not that ye should have communion with demons. 10:21Ye cannot drink 
the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of 
the Lord, and of the table of demons. 10:22Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? 
are we stronger than he? 10:23All things are lawful; but not all 
things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify. 10:24Let no man seek his own, but 
each his neighbor's good. 10:25Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, 
eat, asking no question for conscience' sake, 10:26for the earth is 
the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. 10:27If one of them that believe not 
biddeth you to a feast, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set 
before you, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake. 10:28But if any man say 
unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed 
it, and for conscience sake: 10:29conscience, I say, not thine own, but 
the other's; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience? 10:30If I partake with thankfulness, why am 
I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? 10:31Whether therefore 
ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. 10:32Give no occasions of stumbling, either 
to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God: 10:33even as I also 
please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit 
of the many, that they may be saved. 

11:1Be ye imitators of me, even as I also 
am of Christ. 11:2Now I praise you that ye remember me in 
all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you. 11:3But I would have you know, that the 
head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head 
of Christ is God. 11:4Every man praying or prophesying, 
having his head covered, dishonoreth his head. 11:5But every woman 
praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is 
one and the same thing as if she were shaven. 11:6For if a woman is 
not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn 
or shaven, let her be veiled. 11:7For a man indeed ought not to have his 
head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the 
glory of the man. 11:8For the man is not of the woman; but 
the woman of the man: 11:9for neither was the man created for the 
woman; but the woman for the man: 11:10for this cause ought the woman to have 
a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. 11:11Nevertheless, neither is the woman 
without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord. 11:12For as the woman is of the man, so is 
the man also by the woman; but all things are of God. 11:13Judge ye in 
yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled? 11:14Doth not even nature itself teach you, 
that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him? 11:15But if a woman 
have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. 
11:16But if any man seemeth to be 
contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. 11:17But in giving you this charge, I 
praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse. 11:18For first of all, when ye come 
together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly 
believe it. 11:19For there must be also factions among 
you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you. 11:20When therefore ye assemble yourselves 
together, it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper: 11:21for in your eating 
each one taketh before other his own supper; and one is hungry, and 
another is drunken. 11:22What, have ye not houses to eat and to 
drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? 
What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not. 11:23For I received of the Lord that which 
also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was 
betrayed took bread; 11:24and when he had given thanks, he brake 
it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. 
11:25In like manner also the cup, after 
supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as 
ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 11:26For as often as ye 
eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death till he come. 11:27Wherefore whosoever shall eat the 
bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the 
body and the blood of the Lord. 11:28But let a man prove himself, and so 
let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. 11:29For he that eateth 
and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the 
body. 11:30For this cause many among you are weak 
and sickly, and not a few sleep. 11:31But if we discerned ourselves, we 
should not be judged. 11:32But when we are judged, we are 
chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. 11:33Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come 
together to eat, wait one for another. 11:34If any man is hungry, let him eat at 
home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in 
order whensoever I come. 

12:1Now concerning spiritual gifts, 
brethren, I would not have you ignorant. 12:2Ye know that when ye were Gentiles 
ye were led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might led. 12:3Wherefore I make known unto you, that 
no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can 
say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit. 12:4Now there are 
diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 12:5And there are 
diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord. 12:6And there are 
diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all. 12:7But to each one is given the 
manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal. 12:8For to one is given 
through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, 
according to the same Spirit: 12:9to another faith, in the same Spirit; 
and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit; 12:10and to another 
workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of 
spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; and to another the 
interpretation of tongues: 12:11but all these worketh the one and the 
same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will. 12:12For as the body is one, and hath many 
members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is 
Christ. 12:13For in one Spirit were we all baptized 
into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made 
to drink of one Spirit. 12:14For the body is not one member, but 
many. 12:15If the foot shall say, Because I am 
not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. 12:16And if the ear shall say, Because I am 
not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. 12:17If the whole body were an eye, where 
were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? 12:18But now hath God set the members each 
one of them in the body, even as it pleased him. 12:19And if they were 
all one member, where were the body? 12:20But now they are many members, but one 
body. 12:21And the eye cannot say to the hand, I 
have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 12:22Nay, much rather, those members of the 
body which seem to be more feeble are necessary: 12:23and those 
parts of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we 
bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant 
comeliness; 12:24whereas our comely parts have 
no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that 
part which lacked; 12:25that there should be no schism in the 
body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. 12:26And whether one member suffereth, all 
the members suffer with it; or one member is honored, all the members 
rejoice with it. 12:27Now ye are the body of Christ, and 
severally members thereof. 12:28And God hath set some in the church, 
first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts 
of healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of tongues. 12:29Are all apostles? are all prophets? 
are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? 12:30have all gifts of 
healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? 12:31But desire 
earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you. 

13:1If I speak with the tongues of men and 
of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal. 
13:2And if I have the gift of 
prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so 
as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 13:3And if I bestow all 
my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have 
not love, it profiteth me nothing. 13:4Love suffereth long, and is 
kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 13:5doth not behave itself unseemly, 
seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil; 13:6rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but 
rejoiceth with the truth; 13:7beareth all things, believeth all 
things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. 13:8Love never faileth: 
but whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether 
there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it 
shall be done away. 13:9For we know in part, and we prophesy in 
part; 13:10but when that which is perfect is 
come, that which is in part shall be done away. 13:11When I was a 
child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I 
am become a man, I have put away childish things. 13:12For now we see in 
a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I 
know fully even as also I was fully known. 13:13But now abideth 
faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love. 

14:1Follow after love; yet desire earnestly 
spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy. 14:2For he that 
speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man 
understandeth; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. 14:3But he that 
prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and exhortation, and consolation. 14:4He 
that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the 
church. 14:5Now I would have you all speak with 
tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth 
than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may 
receive edifying. 14:6But now, brethren, if I come unto you 
speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by 
way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching? 14:7Even things without life, giving a 
voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how 
shall it be known what is piped or harped? 14:8For if the trumpet 
give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war? 14:9So also ye, unless 
ye utter by the tongue speech easy to understood, how shall it be known what is 
spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air. 14:10There are, it may 
be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no kind is without 
signification. 14:11If then I know not the meaning of the 
voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be 
a barbarian unto me. 14:12So also ye, since ye are zealous of 
spiritual gifts, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church. 
14:13Wherefore let him that speaketh in a 
tongue pray that he may interpret. 14:14For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit 
prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. 14:15What is it then? I 
will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will 
sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. 14:16Else if thou bless with the spirit, 
how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving 
of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest? 14:17For thou verily 
givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. 14:18I thank God, I 
speak with tongues more than you all: 14:19howbeit in the church I had rather 
speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than 
ten thousand words in a tongue. 14:20Brethren, be not children in mind: yet 
in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men. 14:21In the law it is 
written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak 
unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord. 14:22Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not 
to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying is for a 
sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe. 14:23If therefore the 
whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in 
men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad? 14:24But if all prophesy, and there come in 
one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all; 14:25the secrets of his heart are made 
manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that 
God is among you indeed. 14:26What is it then, brethren? When ye 
come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a 
tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. 14:27If any man speaketh in a tongue, 
let it be by two, or at the most three, and that in turn; and let 
one interpret: 14:28but if there be no interpreter, let 
him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. 14:29And let the prophets speak by 
two or three, and let the others discern. 14:30But if a 
revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence. 14:31For ye all can prophesy one by one, 
that all may learn, and all may be exhorted; 14:32and the spirits of 
the prophets are subject to the prophets; 14:33for God is not 
a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints, 
14:34let the women keep silence in the 
churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in 
subjection, as also saith the law. 14:35And if they would learn anything, let 
them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in 
the church. 14:36What? was it from you that the word of 
God went forth? or came it unto you alone? 14:37If any man 
thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the 
things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord. 14:38But if any man is ignorant, let him be 
ignorant. 14:39Wherefore, my brethren, desire 
earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. 14:40But let all things be done decently 
and in order. 

15:1Now I make known unto you brethren, the 
gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand, 
15:2by which also ye are saved, if ye hold 
fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain. 15:3For I delivered unto you first of all 
that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the 
scriptures; 15:4and that he was buried; and that he 
hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures; 15:5and that he appeared to Cephas; then to 
the twelve; 15:6then he appeared to above five hundred 
brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen 
asleep; 15:7then he appeared to James; then to all 
the apostles; 15:8and last of all, as to the child 
untimely born, he appeared to me also. 15:9For I am the least of the apostles, 
that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of 
God. 15:10But by the grace of God I am what I 
am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored 
more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with 
me. 15:11Whether then it be I or they, 
so we preach, and so ye believed. 15:12Now if Christ is preached that he hath 
been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection 
of the dead? 15:13But if there is no resurrection of the 
dead, neither hath Christ been raised: 15:14and if Christ hath not been raised, 
then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain. 15:15Yea, we are found 
false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: 
whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised. 15:16For if the dead are not raised, 
neither hath Christ been raised: 15:17and if Christ hath not been raised, 
your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. 15:18Then they also 
that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 15:19If we have only 
hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable. 15:20But now hath Christ been raised from 
the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep. 15:21For since by man 
came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. 15:22For as in Adam all die, so also in 
Christ shall all be made alive. 15:23But each in his own order: Christ the 
firstfruits; then they that are Christ's, at his coming. 15:24Then cometh 
the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he 
shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power. 15:25For he must reign, 
till he hath put all his enemies under his feet. 15:26The last enemy 
that shall be abolished is death. 15:27For, He put all things in subjection 
under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is 
evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him. 15:28And when all things have been 
subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did 
subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all. 15:29Else what shall 
they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why 
then are they baptized for them? 15:30Why do we also stand in jeopardy every 
hour? 15:31I protest by that glorifying in you, 
brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. 15:32If after the manner of men I fought 
with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let 
us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. 15:33Be not deceived: Evil companionships 
corrupt good morals. 15:34Awake to soberness righteously, and 
sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak this to move you to 
shame. 15:35But some one will say, How are the 
dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come? 15:36Thou foolish one, 
that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die: 15:37and that which thou sowest, thou 
sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or 
of some other kind; 15:38but God giveth it a body even as it 
pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own. 15:39All flesh is not 
the same flesh: but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of 
beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes. 15:40There are also 
celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, 
and the glory of the terrestrial is another. 15:41There is one glory 
of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for 
one star differeth from another star in glory. 15:42So also is the 
resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in 
incorruption: 15:43it is sown in dishonor; it is raised 
in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: 15:44it is sown a 
natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there 
is also a spiritual body. 15:45So also it is written, The first man 
Adam became a living soul. The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. 15:46Howbeit that is not first which is 
spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual. 15:47The first man is of the earth, earthy: 
the second man is of heaven. 15:48As is the earthy, such are they also 
that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. 
15:49And as we have borne the image of the 
earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. 15:50Now this I say, 
brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth 
corruption inherit incorruption. 15:51Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all 
shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed, 15:52in a moment, in 
the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the 
dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 15:53For this corruptible must put on 
incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. 15:54But when this 
corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on 
immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is 
swallowed up in victory. 15:55O death, where is thy victory? O 
death, where is thy sting? 15:56The sting of death is sin; and the 
power of sin is the law: 15:57but thanks be to God, who giveth us 
the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 15:58Wherefore, my 
beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of 
the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord. 

16:1Now concerning the collection for the 
saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye. 16:2Upon the first day of the week let each 
one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made 
when I come. 16:3And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall 
approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem: 16:4and if it be meet for me to go also, 
they shall go with me. 16:5But I will come unto you, when I shall 
have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia; 16:6but with you it may 
be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey 
whithersoever I go. 16:7For I do not wish to see you now by the 
way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. 16:8But I will tarry at Ephesus until 
Pentecost; 16:9for a great door and effectual is 
opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. 16:10Now if Timothy 
come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, 
as I also do: 16:11let no man therefore despise him. But 
set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect 
him with the brethren. 16:12But as touching Apollos the brother, I 
besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not all 
his will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity. 16:13Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, 
quit you like men, be strong. 16:14Let all that ye do be done in love. 16:15Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know 
the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have 
set themselves to minister unto the saints), 16:16that ye also be in 
subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth. 16:17And I rejoice at the coming of 
Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part 
they supplied. 16:18For they refreshed my spirit and 
yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such. 16:19The churches of 
Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church 
that is in their house. 16:20All the brethren salute you. Salute 
one another with a holy kiss. 16:21The salutation of me Paul with mine 
own hand. 16:22If any man loveth not the Lord, let 
him be anathema. Maranatha. 16:23The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be 
with you. 16:24My love be with you all in Christ 
Jesus. Amen.
