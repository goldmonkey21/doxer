The Epistle of Paul to Titus

1:1Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle 
of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the 
truth which is according to godliness, 1:2in hope of eternal life, which God, who 
cannot lie, promised before times eternal; 1:3but in his own 
seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according 
to the commandment of God our Saviour; 1:4to Titus, my true child after a common 
faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour. 1:5For 
this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things 
that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge; 1:6if 
any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who 
are not accused of riot or unruly. 1:7For the bishop must be blameless, as 
God's steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not 
greedy of filthy lucre; 1:8but given to hospitality, as lover of 
good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled; 1:9holding to the 
faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort 
in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers. 1:10For there are many 
unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision, 1:11whose mouths must be stopped; men who 
overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's 
sake. 1:12One of themselves, a prophet of their 
own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons. 1:13This testimony is true. For which cause 
reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 1:14not giving heed to 
Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. 1:15To 
the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving 
nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. 1:16They profess that they know God; but by 
their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every 
good work reprobate. 

2:1But speak thou the things which befit 
the sound doctrine: 2:2that aged men be temperate, grave, 
sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience: 2:3that aged women 
likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, 
teachers of that which is good; 2:4that they may train the young women to 
love their husbands, to love their children, 2:5to be 
sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own 
husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed: 2:6the younger men 
likewise exhort to be sober-minded: 2:7in all things showing thyself an 
ensample of good works; in thy doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, 
2:8sound speech, that cannot be condemned; 
that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say 
of us. 2:9Exhort servants to be in 
subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing to them 
in all things; not gainsaying; 2:10not purloining, but showing all good 
fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. 2:11For the grace of God hath appeared, 
bringing salvation to all men, 2:12instructing us, to the intent that, 
denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously 
and godly in this present world; 2:13looking for the blessed hope and 
appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 2:14who gave himself for us, that he might 
redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own 
possession, zealous of good works. 2:15These things speak and exhort and 
reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee. 

3:1Put them in mind to be in subjection to 
rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work, 3:2to 
speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness 
toward all men. 3:3For we also once were foolish, 
disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and 
envy, hateful, hating one another. 3:4But when the kindness of God our 
Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared, 3:5not by works 
done in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy 
he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy 
Spirit, 3:6which he poured out upon us richly, 
through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 3:7that, being justified by his grace, we 
might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 3:8Faithful is the 
saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to 
the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. 
These things are good and profitable unto men: 3:9but shun foolish 
questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they 
are unprofitable and vain. 3:10A factious man after a first and second 
admonition refuse; 3:11knowing that such a one is perverted, 
and sinneth, being self-condemned. 3:12When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or 
Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have 
determined to winter. 3:13Set forward Zenas the lawyer and 
Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. 3:14And let our people also learn to 
maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. 3:15All that are with me salute thee. 
Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
