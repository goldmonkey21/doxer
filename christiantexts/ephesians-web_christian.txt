Pauls Letter to the Ephesians 

1:1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through 
the will of God,      to the saints who are at 
Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus: 1:2Grace to you and 
peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
1:3Blessed be the God and Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the 
heavenly places in Christ; 1:4even as he chose us in him before the 
foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in 
love; 1:5having predestined us for adoption as 
children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his 
desire, 1:6to the praise of the glory of his grace, 
by which he freely bestowed favor on us in the Beloved, 1:7in whom we have our 
redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to 
the riches of his grace, 1:8which he made to abound toward us in all 
wisdom and prudence, 1:9making known to us the mystery of his 
will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him 1:10to 
an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, 
the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him; 1:11in 
whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to 
the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will; 1:12to 
the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in 
Christ: 1:13in whom you also, having heard the word 
of the truth, the Gospel of your salvation,--in whom, having also believed, you 
were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 1:14who is a pledge of 
our inheritance, to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of his 
glory. 1:15For this cause I also, having heard of 
the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have 
toward all the saints, 1:16don't cease to give thanks for you, 
making mention of you in my prayers, 1:17that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the 
knowledge of him; 1:18having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that 
you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the 
glory of his inheritance in the saints, 1:19and what is the exceeding greatness of 
his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of 
his might 1:20which he worked in Christ, when he 
raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly 
places, 1:21far above all rule, and authority, and 
power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but 
also in that which is to come. 1:22He put all things in subjection under 
his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly, 1:23which is his body, the fullness of him 
who fills all in all. 
2:1You were made alive when you were dead 
in transgressions and sins, 2:2in which you once walked according to 
the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, the 
spirit who now works in the children of disobedience; 2:3among whom we also 
all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of 
the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. 2:4But 
God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us, 2:5even 
when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by 
grace you have been saved), 2:6and raised us up with him, and made us 
to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 2:7that in the ages to 
come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in 
Christ Jesus; 2:8for by grace you have been saved through 
faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 2:9not of works, that 
no one would boast. 2:10For we are his workmanship, created in 
Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in 
them. 
2:11Therefore remember that once you, the 
Gentiles in the flesh, who are called "uncircumcision" by that which is called 
"circumcision," (in the flesh, made by hands); 2:12that you were at 
that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and 
strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in 
the world. 2:13But now in Christ Jesus you who once 
were far off are made near in the blood of Christ. 2:14For he is our 
peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition, 2:15having abolished in the flesh the 
hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might create 
in himself one new man of the two, making peace; 2:16and might reconcile 
them both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the hostility 
thereby. 2:17He came and preached peace to you who 
were far off and to those who were near. 2:18For through him we both have our access 
in one Spirit to the Father. 2:19So then you are no longer strangers and 
foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of 
God, 2:20being built on the foundation of the 
apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone; 2:21in 
whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord; 
2:22in whom you also are built together for 
a habitation of God in the Spirit. 
3:1For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner 
of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles, 3:2if it is so that you 
have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward 
you; 3:3how that by revelation the mystery was 
made known to me, as I wrote before in few words, 3:4by which, when you 
read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ; 3:5which in other generations was not made 
known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles 
and prophets in the Spirit; 3:6that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and 
fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus 
through the Gospel, 3:7of which I was made a servant, according 
to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of 
his power. 3:8To me, the very least of all saints, was 
this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 
3:9and to make all men see what is the administration of the 
mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through 
Jesus Christ; 3:10to the intent that now through the 
assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities 
and the powers in the heavenly places, 3:11according to the eternal purpose which 
he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord; 3:12in whom we have boldness and access in 
confidence through our faith in him. 3:13Therefore I ask that you may not lose 
heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory. 
3:14For this cause, I bow my knees to the 
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 3:15from whom every family in heaven and on 
earth is named, 3:16that he would grant you, according to 
the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his 
Spirit in the inward man; 3:17that Christ may dwell in your hearts 
through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 3:18may be strengthened to comprehend with 
all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 3:19and to know Christ's love which 
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. 3:20Now to him who is able to do 
exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power 
that works in us, 3:21to him be the glory in the assembly and 
in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen. 
4:1I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, 
beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, 4:2with 
all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love; 4:3being eager to keep the unity of the 
Spirit in the bond of peace. 4:4There is one body, and one Spirit, even 
as you also were called in one hope of your calling; 4:5one Lord, one faith, 
one baptism, 4:6one God and Father of all, who is over 
all, and through all, and in us all. 4:7But to each one of us was the grace 
given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 4:8Therefore he says, 
"When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men." 4:9Now 
this, "He ascended," what is it but that he also first descended into the lower 
parts of the earth? 4:10He who descended is the one who also 
ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things. 
4:11He gave some to be apostles; and some, 
prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, shepherds and teachers; 4:12for the perfecting of the saints, to 
the work of serving, to the building up of the body of Christ; 4:13until we all attain to the unity of the 
faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the 
measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; 4:14that we may no 
longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of 
doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error; 4:15but speaking truth in love, we may grow 
up in all things into him, who is the head, Christ; 4:16from whom all the 
body, being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies, 
according to the working in measure of each individual part, makes the body 
increase to the building up of itself in love. 
4:17This I say therefore, and testify in 
the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk, in the 
futility of their mind, 4:18being darkened in their understanding, 
alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, 
because of the hardening of their hearts; 4:19who having become 
callous gave themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness. 4:20But you did not learn Christ that way; 
4:21if indeed you heard him, and were 
taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus: 4:22that you put away, 
as concerning your former way of life, the old man, that grows corrupt after the 
lusts of deceit; 4:23and that you be renewed in the spirit 
of your mind, 4:24and put on the new man, who in the 
likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth. 
4:25Therefore, putting away falsehood, 
speak truth each one with his neighbor. For we are members one of another. 4:26"Be angry, and don't sin." Don't let 
the sun go down on your wrath, 4:27neither give place to the devil. 4:28Let him who stole steal no more; but 
rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may 
have something to give to him who has need. 4:29Let no corrupt 
speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for building up as the 
need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear. 4:30Don't grieve the 
Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 4:31Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, 
outcry, and slander, be put away from you, with all malice. 4:32And be kind to one 
another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave 
you. 
5:1Be therefore imitators of God, as 
beloved children. 5:2Walk in love, even as Christ also loved 
you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a 
sweet-smelling fragrance. 5:3But sexual immorality, and all 
uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes 
saints; 5:4nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor 
jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks. 
5:5Know this for sure, that no sexually 
immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has 
any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God. 
5:6Let no one deceive you with empty words. 
For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of 
disobedience. 5:7Therefore don't be partakers with them. 
5:8For you were once darkness, but are now 
light in the Lord. Walk as children of light, 5:9for the fruit of the 
Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth, 5:10proving what is 
well-pleasing to the Lord. 5:11Have no fellowship with the unfruitful 
works of darkness, but rather even reprove them. 5:12For the things 
which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of. 5:13But all things, when they are reproved, 
are revealed by the light, for everything that is revealed is light. 5:14Therefore he says, "Awake, you who 
sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you." 
5:15Therefore watch carefully how you walk, 
not as unwise, but as wise; 5:16redeeming the time, because the days 
are evil. 5:17Therefore don't be foolish, but 
understand what the will of the Lord is. 5:18Don't be drunken with wine, in which is 
dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit, 5:19speaking to one 
another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and singing praises in 
your heart to the Lord; 5:20giving thanks always concerning all 
things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father; 5:21subjecting yourselves one to another in 
the fear of Christ. 
5:22Wives, be subject to your own husbands, 
as to the Lord. 5:23For the husband is the head of the 
wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of 
the body. 5:24But as the assembly is subject to 
Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything. 
5:25Husbands, love your wives, even as 
Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it; 5:26that he might 
sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, 5:27that he might present the assembly to 
himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it 
should be holy and without blemish. 5:28Even so ought husbands also to love 
their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself. 5:29For no man ever hated his own flesh; 
but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly; 5:30because we are members of his body, of 
his flesh and bones. 5:31"For this cause a man will leave his 
father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will become one 
flesh." 5:32This mystery is great, but I speak 
concerning Christ and of the assembly. 5:33Nevertheless each of you must also love 
his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her 
husband. 
6:1Children, obey your parents in the Lord, 
for this is right. 6:2"Honor your father and mother," which is 
the first commandment with a promise: 6:3"that it may be well with you, and you 
may live long on the earth." 
6:4You fathers, don't provoke your children 
to wrath, but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. 
6:5Servants, be obedient to those who 
according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness 
of your heart, as to Christ; 6:6not in the way of service only when eyes 
are on you, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God 
from the heart; 6:7with good will doing service, as to the 
Lord, and not to men; 6:8knowing that whatever good thing each 
one does, he will receive the same again from the Lord, whether he is bound or 
free. 
6:9You masters, do the same things to them, 
and give up threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is 
in heaven, and there is no partiality with him. 
6:10Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in 
the strength of his might. 6:11Put on the whole armor of God, that you 
may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 6:12For our wrestling 
is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the 
powers, against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the 
spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. 6:13Therefore, put on 
the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, 
having done all, to stand. 6:14Stand therefore, having the utility 
belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of 
righteousness, 6:15and having fitted your feet with the 
preparation of the Gospel of peace; 6:16above all, taking up the shield of 
faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil 
one. 6:17And take the helmet of salvation, and 
the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; 6:18with all prayer and 
requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in 
all perseverance and requests for all the saints: 6:19on my behalf, that 
utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness 
the mystery of the Gospel, 6:20for which I am an ambassador in chains; 
that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. 
6:21But that you also may know my affairs, 
how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, 
will make known to you all things; 6:22whom I have sent to you for this very 
purpose, that you may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts. 
6:23Peace be to the brothers, and love with 
faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 6:24Grace be with all 
those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love. Amen.
