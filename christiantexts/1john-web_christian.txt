1 John. JohnÂ’s First Letter

1:1That which was from the beginning, that 
which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, 
and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life 1:2(and the life was 
revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the 
eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us); 1:3that 
which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have 
fellowship with us. Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his 
Son, Jesus Christ. 1:4And we write these things to you, that 
our joy may be fulfilled. 
1:5This is the message which we have heard 
from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at 
all. 1:6If we say that we have fellowship with 
him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and don't tell the truth. 1:7But 
if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one 
another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin. 1:8If 
we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 1:9If 
we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to 
cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1:10If we say that we haven't sinned, we 
make him a liar, and his word is not in us. 
2:1My little children, I write these things 
to you so that you may not sin. If anyone sins, we have a Counselor with the 
Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous. 2:2And he is the atoning sacrifice for 
our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. 2:3This 
is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments. 2:4One who says, "I 
know him," and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isn't in 
him. 2:5But whoever keeps his word, God's love 
has most assuredly been perfected in him. This is how we know that we are in 
him: 2:6he who says he remains in him ought 
himself also to walk just like he walked. 
2:7Brothers, I write no new commandment to 
you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old 
commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning. 2:8Again, I write a new 
commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is 
passing away, and the true light already shines. 2:9He who says he is in 
the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now. 2:10He 
who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion for 
stumbling in him. 2:11But he who hates his brother is in the 
darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesn't know where he is going, because 
the darkness has blinded his eyes. 
2:12I write to you, little children, 
because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. 
2:13I write to you, fathers, because you 
know him who is from the beginning. 
I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. 
I write to you, little children, because you know the Father. 
2:14I have written to you, fathers, because 
you know him who is from the beginning. 
I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God 
remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 
2:15Don't love the world, neither the 
things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love isn't 
in him. 2:16For all that is in the world, the lust 
of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, isn't the Father's, 
but is the world's. 2:17The world is passing away with its 
lusts, but he who does God's will remains forever. 
2:18Little children, these are the end 
times, and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists 
have arisen. By this we know that it is the end times. 2:19They went out from 
us, but they didn't belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would 
have continued with us. But they left, that they might be revealed that none of 
them belong to us. 2:20You have an anointing from the Holy 
One, and you know the truth. 2:21I have not written to you because you 
don't know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the 
truth. 2:22Who is the liar but he who denies that 
Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the 
Son. 2:23Whoever denies the Son, the same 
doesn't have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also. 
2:24Therefore, as for you, let that remain 
in you which you heard from the beginning. If that which you heard from the 
beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son, and in the Father. 2:25This is the promise which he promised 
us, the eternal life. 2:26These things I have written to you 
concerning those who would lead you astray. 2:27As for you, the 
anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you don't need for 
anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and 
is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you will remain in him. 2:28Now, little children, remain in him, 
that when he appears, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his 
coming. 2:29If you know that he is righteous, you 
know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him. 
3:1Behold, how great a love the Father has 
bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God! For this cause the 
world doesn't know us, because it didn't know him. 3:2Beloved, now we are 
children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be. But we know that, 
when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is. 3:3Everyone who has this hope set on him 
purifies himself, even as he is pure. 3:4Everyone who sins also commits 
lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness. 3:5You know that he was revealed to take 
away our sins, and in him is no sin. 3:6Whoever remains in him doesn't sin. 
Whoever sins hasn't seen him, neither knows him. 
3:7Little children, let no one lead you 
astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 3:8He 
who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To 
this end the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the 
devil. 3:9Whoever is born of God doesn't commit 
sin, because his seed remains in him; and he can't sin, because he is born of 
God. 3:10In this the children of God are 
revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever doesn't do righteousness is not 
of God, neither is he who doesn't love his brother. 3:11For this is the 
message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another; 3:12unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, 
and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his works were evil, and 
his brother's righteous. 3:13Don't be surprised, my brothers, if the 
world hates you. 3:14We know that we have passed out of 
death into life, because we love the brothers. He who doesn't love his brother 
remains in death. 3:15Whoever hates his brother is a 
murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him. 
3:16By this we know love, because he laid 
down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. 3:17But whoever has the world's goods, and 
sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how 
does the love of God remain in him? 3:18My little children, let's not love in 
word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and truth. 3:19And by this we know that we are of the 
truth, and persuade our hearts before him, 3:20because if our 
heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. 3:21Beloved, if our hearts don't condemn 
us, we have boldness toward God; 3:22and whatever we ask, we receive from 
him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his 
sight. 3:23This is his commandment, that we should 
believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he 
commanded. 3:24He who keeps his commandments remains 
in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit 
which he gave us. 
4:1Beloved, don't believe every spirit, but 
test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone 
out into the world. 4:2By this you know the Spirit of God: 
every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, 4:3and 
every spirit who doesn't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not 
of God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of whom you have heard that it 
comes. Now it is in the world already. 4:4You are of God, little children, and 
have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the 
world. 4:5They are of the world. Therefore they 
speak of the world, and the world hears them. 4:6We are of God. He 
who knows God listens to us. He who is not of God doesn't listen to us. By this 
we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 
4:7Beloved, let us love one another, for 
love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God. 4:8He 
who doesn't love doesn't know God, for God is love. 4:9By this was God's 
love revealed in us, that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that 
we might live through him. 4:10In this is love, not that we loved God, 
but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for 
our sins. 4:11Beloved, if God loved us in this way, 
we also ought to love one another. 4:12No one has seen God at any time. If we 
love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us. 4:13By 
this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his 
Spirit. 4:14We have seen and testify that the 
Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world. 4:15Whoever confesses 
that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God. 4:16We 
know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who 
remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. 4:17In this love has 
been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, 
because as he is, even so are we in this world. 4:18There is no fear in 
love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment. He who fears 
is not made perfect in love. 4:19We love Him, because he first loved us. 
4:20If a man says, "I love God," and hates 
his brother, he is a liar; for he who doesn't love his brother whom he has seen, 
how can he love God whom he has not seen? 4:21This commandment we 
have from him, that he who loves God should also love his brother. 
5:1Whoever believes that Jesus is the 
Christ is born of God. Whoever loves the father also loves the child who is born 
of him. 5:2By this we know that we love the 
children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments. 5:3For this is the love 
of God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous. 5:4For 
whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has 
overcome the world: your faith. 5:5Who is he who overcomes the world, but 
he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 5:6This is he who came 
by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water 
and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 
5:7For there are three who testify*: 
5:8the Spirit, and the water, and the 
blood; and the three agree as one. 5:9If we receive the witness of men, the 
witness of God is greater; for this is God's testimony which he has testified 
concerning his Son. 5:10He who believes in the Son of God has 
the testimony in himself. He who doesn't believe God has made him a liar, 
because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his 
Son. 5:11The testimony is this, that God gave to 
us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 5:12He who has the Son 
has the life. He who doesn't have God's Son doesn't have the life. 5:13These things I have written to you who 
believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal 
life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God. 
5:14This is the boldness which we have 
toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us. 5:15And if we know that he listens to us, 
whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him. 
5:16If anyone sees his brother sinning a 
sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who 
sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death. I don't say that he 
should make a request concerning this. 5:17All unrighteousness is sin, and there 
is a sin not leading to death. 5:18We know that whoever is born of God 
doesn't sin, but he who was born of God keeps himself, and the evil one doesn't 
touch him. 5:19We know that we are of God, and the 
whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 5:20We know that the 
Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is 
true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true 
God, and eternal life. 
5:21Little children, keep yourselves from 
idols.
