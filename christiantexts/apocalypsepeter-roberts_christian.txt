Apocalypse of Peter












THE APOCALYPSE OF PETER 
1 . . . . many of them will be false prophets, and will teach divers ways and 
doctrines of perdition: but these will become sons of perdition. 3. And then God 
will come unto my faithful ones who hunger and thirst and are afflicted and 
purify their souls in this life; and he will judge the sons of lawlessness. 
4. And furthermore the Lord said: Let us go into the mountain: Let us pray.. 
And going with him, we, the twelve disciples, begged that he would show us one 
of our brethren, the righteous who are gone forth out of the world, in order 
that we might see of what manner of form they are, and having taken courage, 
might also encourage the men who hear us. 
6. And as we prayed, suddenly there appeared two men standing before the Lord 
towards the East, on whom we were not able to look; 7, for there came forth from 
their countenance a ray as of the sun, and their raiment was shining, such as 
eye of man never saw; for no mouth is able to express or heart to conceive the 
glory with which they were endued, and the beauty of their appearance. 8. And as 
we looked upon them, we were astounded; for their bodies were whiter than any 
snow and ruddier than any rose; 9, and the red thereof was mingled with the 
white, and I am utterly unable to express their beauty; 10, for their hair was 
curly and bright and seemly both on their face and shoulders, as it were a 
wreath woven of spikenard and divers-coloured flowers, or like a rainbow in the 
sky, such was their seemliness. 
11. Seeing therefore their beauty we became astounded at them, since they 
appeared suddenly. 12. And I approached the Lord and said: Who are these? 13. He 
saith to me: These are your brethren the righteous, whose forms ye desired to 
see. 14. And I said to him: And where are all the righteous ones and what is the 
aeon in which they are and have this glory? 
15. And the Lord showed me a very great country outside of this world, 
exceeding bright with light, and the air there lighted with the rays of the sun, 
and the earth itself blooming with unfading flowers and full of spices and 
plants, fair-flowering and incorruptible and bearing blessed fruit. 16. And so 
great was the perfume that it was borne thence even unto us. 17. And the 
dwellers in that place were clad in the raiment of shining angels and their 
raiment was like unto their country; and angels hovered about them there. 18. 
And the glory of the dwellers there was equal, and with one voice they sang 
praises alternately to the Lord God, rejoicing in that place. 19. The Lord saith 
to us: This is the place of your high-priests, the righteous men. 
20. And over against that place I saw another, squalid, and it was the place 
of punishment; and those who were punished there and the punishing angels had 
their raiment dark like the air of the place. 
21. And there were certain there hanging by the tongue: and these were the 
blasphemers of the way of righteousness; and under them lay fire, burning and 
punishing them. 22. And there was a great lake, full of flaming mire, in which 
were certain men that pervert righteousness, and tormenting angels afflicted 
them. 
23. And there were also others, women, hanged by their hair over that mire 
that bubbled up: and these were they who adorned themselves for adultery; and 
the men who mingled with them in the defilement of adultery, were hanging by the 
feet and their heads in that mire. And I said: I did not believe that I should 
come into this place. 
24. And I saw the murderers and those who conspired with them, cast into a 
certain strait place, full of evil snakes, and smitten by those beasts, and thus 
turning to and fro in that punishment; and worms, as it were clouds of darkness, 
afflicted them. And the souls of the murdered stood and looked upon the 
punishment of those murderers and said: O God, thy judgment is just. 
25. And near that place I saw another strait place into which the gore and 
the filth of those who were being punished ran down and became there as it were 
a lake: and there sat women having the gore up to their necks, and over against 
them sat many children who were born to them out of due time, crying; and there 
came forth from them sparks of fire and smote the women in the eyes: and these 
were the accursed who conceived and caused abortion. 
26. And other men and women were burning up to the middle and were cast into 
a dark place and were beaten by evil spirits, and their inwards were eaten by 
restless worms: and these were they who persecuted the righteous and delivered 
them up. 
27. And near those there were again women and men gnawing their own lips, and 
being punished and receiving a red-hot iron in their eyes: and these were they 
who blasphemed and slandered the way of righteousness. 
28. And over against these again other men and women gnawing their tongues 
and having flaming fire in their mouths: and these were the false witnesses. 
29. And in a certain other place there were pebbles sharper than swords or 
any spit, red-hot, and women and men in tattered and filthy raiment rolled about 
on them in punishment: and these were the rich who trusted in their riches and 
had no pity for orphans and widows, and despised the commandment of God. 
30. And in another great lake, full of pitch and blood and mire bubbling up, 
there stood men and women up to their knees: and these were the usurers and 
those who take interest on interest. 
31. And other men and women were being hurled down from a great cliff and 
reached the bottom, and again were driven by those who were set over them to 
climb up upon the cliff, and thence were hurled down again, and had no rest from 
this punishment: and these were they who defiled their bodies acting as women; 
and the women who were with them were those who lay with one another as a man 
with a woman. 
32. And alongside of that cliff there was a place full of much fire, and 
there stood men who with their own hands had made for themselves carven images 
instead of God. And alongside of these were other men and women, having rods and 
striking each other and never ceasing from such punishment. 
33. And others again near them, women and men, burning and turning themselves 
and roasting: and these were they that leaving the way of God 
FRAGMENTS OF THE APOCALYPSE OF PETER. 
1. CLEMENS ALEXANDRINUS, Eclog. 48. For instance, Peter in the Apocalypse 
says that the children who are born out of due time shall be of the better part: 
and that these are delivered over to a care-taking angel that they may attain a 
share of knowledge and gain the better abode [after suffering what they would 
have suffered if they had been in the body: but the others shall merely obtain 
salvation as injured beings to whom mercy is shown, and remain without 
punishment, receiving this as a reward].* 
2. CLEM. ALEX. Eclog. 49. But the milk of the women running down from their 
breasts and congealing shall engender small flesh eating beasts: and these run 
up upon them and devour them. 
3. MACARIUS MAGNES, Apocritica iv., 6 cf. 16. The earth, it (sc. the Apoc. of 
Peter) says, "shall present all men before God at the day of judgment, being 
itself also to be judged, with the heaven also which encompasses it." 
4. CLEM. ALEX. Eclog. 41. The scripture says that infants that have been 
exposed are delivered to a care-taking angel, by whom they are educated and so 
grow up, and they will be, it says, as the faithful of a hundred years old are 
here. 
5. METHODIUS, Conviv. ii., 6. Whence also we have received in 
divinely-inspired scriptures that untimely births are delivered to care-taking 
angels, even if they are the offspring of adultery.
