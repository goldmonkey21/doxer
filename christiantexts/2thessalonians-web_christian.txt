2 Thessalonians












2 Thessalonians. PaulÂ’s Second Letter to the Thessalonians 

1:1Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the 
assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: 1:2Grace to you and peace from God our 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
1:3We are bound to always give thanks to 
God for you, brothers, even as it is 
appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and 
every one of you towards one another abounds; 1:4so that we ourselves 
boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your 
persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure. 1:5This is an obvious 
sign of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy 
of the Kingdom of God, for which you also suffer. 1:6Since it is a 
righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you, 1:7and 
to give relief to you that are afflicted with us, when the Lord Jesus is 
revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, 1:8giving vengeance to 
those who don't know God, and to those who don't obey the Gospel of our Lord 
Jesus, 1:9who will pay the penalty: eternal 
destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might, 1:10when he comes to be glorified in his 
saints, and to be admired among all those who have believed (because our 
testimony to you was believed) in that day. 
1:11To this end we also pray always for 
you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire 
of goodness and work of faith, with power; 1:12that the name of 
our Lord Jesus* 
may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and 
the Lord Jesus Christ. 
2:1Now, brothers, concerning the coming of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him, we ask you 2:2not 
to be quickly shaken in your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by 
word, or by letter as from us, saying that the day of Christ had come. 2:3Let 
no one deceive you in any way. For it will not be, unless the departure comes 
first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction, 2:4he 
who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is 
worshiped; so that he sits as God in the temple of God, setting himself up as 
God. 2:5Don't you remember that, when I was 
still with you, I told you these things? 2:6Now you know what is restraining him, to 
the end that he may be revealed in his own season. 2:7For the mystery of 
lawlessness already works. Only there is one who restrains now, until he is 
taken out of the way. 2:8Then the lawless one will be revealed, 
whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nothing by 
the brightness of his coming; 2:9even he whose coming is according to the 
working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 2:10and with all 
deception of wickedness for those who are being lost, because they didn't 
receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 2:11Because of this, 
God sends them a working of error, that they should believe a lie; 2:12that they all might be judged who 
didn't believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. 2:13But we are bound to always give thanks 
to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the 
beginning for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the 
truth; 2:14to which he called you through our 
Gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 2:15So 
then, brothers, stand firm, and hold the traditions which you were taught by us, 
whether by word, or by letter. 
2:16Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and 
God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through 
grace, 2:17comfort your hearts and establish you 
in every good work and word. 
3:1Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the 
word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, even as also with you; 3:2and 
that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for not all have faith. 
3:3But the Lord is faithful, who will 
establish you, and guard you from the evil one. 3:4We have confidence 
in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things we command. 
3:5May the Lord direct your hearts into the 
love of God, and into the patience of Christ. 
3:6Now we command you, brothers, in the 
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother 
who walks in rebellion, and not after the tradition which they received from us. 
3:7For you know how you ought to imitate 
us. For we didn't behave ourselves rebelliously among you, 3:8neither did we eat 
bread from anyone's hand without paying for it, but in labor and travail worked 
night and day, that we might not burden any of you; 3:9not because we don't 
have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate 
us. 3:10For even when we were with you, we 
commanded you this: "If anyone will not work, neither let him eat." 3:11For we hear of some who walk among you 
in rebellion, who don't work at all, but are busybodies. 3:12Now those who are 
that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness 
they work, and eat their own bread. 
3:13But you, brothers, don't be weary in 
doing well. 3:14If any man doesn't obey our word in 
this letter, note that man, that you have no company with him, to the end that 
he may be ashamed. 3:15Don't count him as an enemy, but 
admonish him as a brother. 
3:16Now may the Lord of peace himself give 
you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all. 
3:17The greeting of me, Paul, with my own 
hand, which is the sign in every letter: this is how I write. 3:18The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be 
with you all. Amen.

for "brothers" here and where context allows may also be correctly translated 
"brothers and sisters" or "siblings."
