The First Epistle General of John 

1:1That which was from the beginning, that 
which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we 
beheld, and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life 1:2(and the life was 
manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare unto you the life, 
the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us); 
1:3that which we have seen and heard 
declare we unto you also, that ye also may have fellowship with us: yea, and our 
fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ: 1:4and these things we 
write, that our joy may be made full. 1:5And this is the message which we have 
heard from him and announce unto you, that God is light, and in him is no 
darkness at all. 1:6If we say that we have fellowship with 
him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: 1:7but if we walk in 
the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the 
blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin. 1:8If we say that we 
have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 1:9If 
we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to 
cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1:10If we say that we have not sinned, we 
make him a liar, and his word is not in us. 

2:1My little children, these things write I 
unto you that ye may not sin. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the 
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 2:2and he is the propitiation for our sins; 
and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. 2:3And hereby we know 
that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 2:4He that saith, I 
know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in 
him; 2:5but whoso keepeth his word, in him 
verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him: 
2:6he that saith he abideth in him ought 
himself also to walk even as he walked. 2:7Beloved, no new commandment write I unto 
you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment 
is the word which ye heard. 2:8Again, a new commandment write I unto 
you, which thing is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing 
away, and the true light already shineth. 2:9He that saith he is in the light and 
hateth his brother, is in the darkness even until now. 2:10He that loveth his 
brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him. 2:11But he that hateth his brother is in 
the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, 
because the darkness hath blinded his eyes. 2:12I write unto you, 
my little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's 
sake. 2:13I write unto you, fathers, because ye 
know him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have 
overcome the evil one. I have written unto you, little children, because ye know 
the Father. 2:14I have written unto you, fathers, 
because ye know him who is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young 
men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have 
overcome the evil one. 2:15Love not the world, neither the things 
that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not 
in him. 2:16For all that is in the world, the lust 
of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vain glory of life, is not of the 
Father, but is of the world. 2:17And the world passeth away, and the 
lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. 2:18Little children, it is the last hour: 
and as ye heard that antichrist cometh, even now have there arisen many 
antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last hour. 2:19They went out from 
us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have 
continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest 
that they all are not of us. 2:20And ye have an anointing from the Holy 
One, and ye know all the things. 2:21I have not written unto you because ye 
know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because no lie is of the truth. 
2:22Who is the liar but he that denieth 
that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, even he that denieth 
the Father and the Son. 2:23Whosoever denieth the Son, the same 
hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son hath the Father also. 2:24As 
for you, let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning. If that which 
ye heard from the beginning abide in you, ye also shall abide in the Son, and in 
the Father. 2:25And this is the promise which he 
promised us, even the life eternal. 2:26These things have I 
written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray. 2:27And as for you, the 
anointing which ye received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any one 
teach you; but as his anointing teacheth you; concerning all things, and is 
true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, ye abide in him. 2:28And now, my little children, 
abide in him; that, if he shall be manifested, we may have boldness, and not be 
ashamed before him at his coming. 2:29If ye know that he is righteous, ye 
know that every one also that doeth righteousness is begotten of him. 

3:1Behold what manner of love the Father 
hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and such 
we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 3:2Beloved, now are we children of God, and 
it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be 
manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is. 3:3And 
every one that hath this hope set on him purifieth himself, even as he is 
pure. 3:4Every one that doeth sin doeth also 
lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. 3:5And ye know that he was manifested to 
take away sins; and in him is no sin. 3:6Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: 
whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him. 3:7My little 
children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, 
even as he is righteous: 3:8he that doeth sin is of the devil; for 
the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, 
that he might destroy the works of the devil. 3:9Whosoever is 
begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot 
sin, because he is begotten of God. 3:10In this the children of God are 
manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is 
not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. 3:11For this is the 
message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another: 3:12not as Cain was of the evil one, and 
slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and 
his brother's righteous. 3:13Marvel not, brethren, if the world 
hateth you. 3:14We know that we have passed out of 
death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in 
death. 3:15Whosoever hateth his brother is a 
murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 3:16Hereby know we love, because he laid 
down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 3:17But whoso hath the world's goods, and 
beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth 
the love of God abide in him? 3:18My Little children, let us not 
love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth. 3:19Hereby shall we know that we are of the 
truth, and shall assure our heart before him: 3:20because if our 
heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 3:21Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, 
we have boldness toward God; 3:22and whatsoever we ask we receive of 
him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his 
sight. 3:23And this is his commandment, that we 
should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even 
as he gave us commandment. 3:24And he that keepeth his commandments 
abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the 
Spirit which he gave us. 


4:1Beloved, believe not every spirit, but 
prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone 
out into the world. 4:2Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every 
spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 4:3and 
every spirit that confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the 
spirit of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now 
it is in the world already. 4:4Ye are of God, my little 
children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he 
that is in the world. 4:5They are of the world: therefore speak 
they as of the world, and the world heareth them. 4:6We are of God: he 
that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we 
know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 4:7Beloved, let us love 
one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, 
and knoweth God. 4:8He that loveth not knoweth not God; for 
God is love. 4:9Herein was the love of God manifested in 
us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live 
through him. 4:10Herein is love, not that we loved God, 
but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our 
sins. 4:11Beloved, if God so loved us, we also 
ought to love one another. 4:12No man hath beheld God at any time: if 
we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us: 4:13hereby we know that we abide in him and 
he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. 4:14And we have beheld 
and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Saviour of 
the world. 4:15Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is 
the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God. 4:16And we know and 
have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in 
love abideth in God, and God abideth in him. 4:17Herein is love made 
perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he 
is, even so are we in this world. 4:18There is no fear in love: but perfect 
love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not 
made perfect in love. 4:19We love, because he first loved us. 4:20If 
a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth 
not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen. 4:21And this commandment have we from him, 
that he who loveth God love his brother also. 


5:1Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the 
Christ is begotten of God: and whosoever loveth him that begat loveth him also 
that is begotten of him. 5:2Hereby we know that we love the children 
of God, when we love God and do his commandments. 5:3For this is the love 
of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. 5:4For 
whatsoever is begotten of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that 
hath overcome the world, even our faith. 5:5And who is he that 
overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 5:6This 
is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not with the water 
only, but with the water and with the blood. 5:7And it is the Spirit 
that beareth witness, because the Spirit is the truth. 5:8For there are three 
who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree 
in one. 5:9If we receive the witness of men, the 
witness of God is greater: for the witness of God is this, that he hath borne 
witness concerning his Son. 5:10He that believeth on the Son of God 
hath the witness in him: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because 
he hath not believed in the witness that God hath borne concerning his Son. 5:11And the witness is this, that God gave 
unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 5:12He that hath the 
Son hath the life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not the life. 5:13These things have I written unto you, 
that ye may know that ye have eternal life, even unto you that believe on 
the name of the Son of God. 5:14And this is the boldness which we have 
toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us: 5:15and if we know that he heareth us 
whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of 
him. 5:16If any man see his brother sinning a 
sin not unto death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for them 
that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: not concerning this do I say 
that he should make request. 5:17All unrighteousness is sin: and there 
is a sin not unto death. 5:18We know that whosoever is begotten of 
God sinneth not; but he that was begotten of God keepeth himself, and the evil 
one toucheth him not. 5:19We know that we are of God, and the 
whole world lieth in the evil one. 5:20And we know that the Son of God is 
come, and hath given us an understanding, that we know him that is true, and we 
are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true 
God, and eternal life. 5:21My little children, guard 
yourselves from idols.
