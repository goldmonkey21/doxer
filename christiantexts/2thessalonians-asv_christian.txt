2 Thessalonians












2 Thessalonians. The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 

1:1Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto 
the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ; 1:2Grace to you and peace from God the 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 1:3We are bound to give thanks to God 
always to you, brethren, even as it is meet, for that your faith growth 
exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all toward one another aboundeth; 
1:4so that we ourselves glory in you in the 
churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the 
afflictions which ye endure; 1:5which is a manifest token of the 
righteous judgment of God; to the end that ye may be counted worthy of the 
kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer: 1:6if so be that it is righteous thing with 
God to recompense affliction to them that afflict you, 1:7and to you that are 
afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the 
angels of his power in flaming fire, 1:8rendering vengeance to them that know 
not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus: 1:9who 
shall suffer punishment, even eternal destruction from the face of the 
Lord and from the glory of his might, 1:10when he shall come to be glorified in 
his saints, and to be marvelled at in all them that believed (because our 
testimony unto you was believed) in that day. 1:11To which end we 
also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and 
fulfil every desire of goodness and every work of faith, with power; 1:12that the name of our Lord Jesus may be 
glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

2:1Now we beseech you, brethren, touching 
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him; 2:2to 
the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, 
either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of the 
Lord is just at hand; 2:3let no man beguile you in any wise: for 
it will not be, except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be 
revealed, the son of perdition, 2:4he that opposeth and exalteth himself 
against all that is called God or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the 
temple of God, setting himself forth as God. 2:5Remember ye not, 
that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? 2:6And now ye know that 
which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season. 2:7For 
the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only there is one that 
restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way. 2:8And then shall be 
revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of his 
mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming; 2:9even he, whose coming is 
according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 2:10and with all deceit of unrighteousness 
for them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they 
might be saved. 2:11And for this cause God sendeth them a 
working of error, that they should believe a lie: 2:12that they all might 
be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. 2:13But we are bound to give thanks to God 
always for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you from the 
beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the 
truth: 2:14whereunto he called you through our 
gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 2:15So 
then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye were taught, 
whether by word, or by epistle of ours. 2:16Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and 
God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through 
grace, 2:17comfort your hearts and establish them 
in every good work and word. 

3:1Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the 
word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also it is with you; 
3:2and that we may be delivered from 
unreasonable and evil men; for all have not faith. 3:3But the Lord is 
faithful, who shall establish you, and guard you from the evil one. 3:4And 
we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the 
things which we command. 3:5And the Lord direct your hearts into the 
love of God, and into the patience of Christ. 3:6Now we command you, 
brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from 
every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they 
received of us. 3:7For yourselves know how ye ought to 
imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you; 3:8neither did we eat bread for nought at 
any man's hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might 
not burden any of you: 3:9not because we have not the right, but 
to make ourselves and ensample unto you, that ye should imitate us. 3:10For even when we were with you, this we 
commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat. 3:11For we hear of some 
that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies. 3:12Now them that are such we command and 
exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their 
own bread. 3:13But ye, brethren, be not weary in 
well-doing. 3:14And if any man obeyeth not our word by 
this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with him, to the end that 
he may be ashamed. 3:15And yet count him not as an 
enemy, but admonish him as a brother. 3:16Now the Lord of peace himself give you 
peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all. 3:17The salutation of 
me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write. 3:18The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be 
with you all.
