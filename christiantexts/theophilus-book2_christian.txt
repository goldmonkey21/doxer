THEOPHILUS TO AUTOLYCUS 
BOOK II 
CHAP. I.--OCCASION OF WRITING THIS BOOK. 
WHEN we had formerly some conversation, my very good friend Autolycus, and 
when you inquired who was my God, and for a little paid attention to my 
discourse, I made some explanations to you concerning my religion; and then 
having bid one another adieu, we went with much mutual friendliness each to his 
own house although at first you had home somewhat hard upon me. For you know and 
remember that you supposed our doctrine was foolishness. As you then afterwards 
urged me to do, I am desirous, though not educated to the art of speaking, of 
more accurately demonstrating, by means of this tractate, the vain labour and 
empty worship in which you are held; and I wish also, from a few of your own 
histories which you read, and perhaps do not yet quite understand, to make the 
truth plain to you. 
CHAP. II.--THE GODS ARE DESPISED WHEN THEY ARE MADE; BUT BECOME VALUABLE WHEN 
BOUGHT. 
And in truth it does seem to me absurd that statuaries and carvers, or 
painters, or moulders, should both design and paint, and carve, and mould, and 
prepare gods, who, when they are produced by the artificers, are reckoned of no 
value; but as soon as they are purchased by some and placed in some so-called 
temple, or in some house, not only do those who bought them sacrifice to them, 
but also those who made and sold them come with much devotion, and apparatus of 
sacrifice, and libations, to worship them; and they reckon them gods, not seeing 
that they are just such as when they were made by themselves, whether stone, or 
brass, or wood, or colour, or some other material. And this is your case, too, 
when you read the histories and genealogies of the so-called gods. For when you 
read of their births, you think of them as men, but afterwards you call them 
gods, and worship them, not reflecting nor understanding that, when born, they 
are exactly such beings as ye read of before. 
CHAP. III.--WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE GODS? 
And of the gods of former times, if indeed they were begotten, the generation 
was sufficiently prolific. But now, where is their generation exhibited? For if 
of old they begot and were begotten, it is plain that even to the present time 
there should be gods begotten and born; or at least if it be not so, such a race 
will be reckoned impotent. For either they have waxed old, and on that account 
no longer beget, or they have died out and no longer exist. For if the gods were 
begotten, they ought to be born even until now, as men, too, are born; yea, much 
more numerous should the gods be than men, as the Sibyl says:- "For if the gods 
beget, and each remains Immortal, then the race of gods must be More numerous 
than mortals, and the throng So great that mortals find no room to stand." 
For if the children begotten of men who are mortal and short-lived make an 
appearance even until now, and men have not ceased to be born, so that cities 
and villages are full, and even the country places also are inhabited, how ought 
not the gods, who, according to your poets, do not die, much rather to beget and 
be begotten, since you say that the gods were produced by generation? And why 
was the mount which is called Olympus formerly inhabited by the gods, but now 
lies deserted? Or why did Jupiter, in days of yore, dwell on Ida, and was known 
to dwell there, according to Homer and other poets, but now is beyond ken? And 
why was he found only in one part of the earth, and not everywhere? For either 
he neglected the other parts, or was not able to be present everywhere and 
provide for all. For if he were, e.g., in an eastern place, he was not in the 
western; and if, on the other hand, he were present in the western parts, he was 
not in the eastern. But this is the attribute of God, the Highest and Almighty, 
and the living God, not only to be everywhere present, but also to see all 
things and to hear all, and by no means to be confined in a place; for if He 
were, then the place containing Him would be greater than He; for that which 
contains is greater than that which is contained. For God is not contained, but 
is Himself the place of all. But why has Jupiter left Ida? Was it because he 
died, or did that mountain no longer please him? And where has he gone? To 
heaven? No. But you will perhaps say, To Crete? Yes, for there, too, his tomb is 
shown to this day. Again, you will say, To Pisa, where he reflects glory on the 
hands of Phidias to this day. Let us, then, proceed to the writings of the 
philosophers and poets. 
CHAP. IV.--ABSURD OPINIONS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS CONCERNING GOD. 
Some of the philosophers of the Porch say that there is no God at all; or, if 
there is, they say that He cares for none but Himself; and these views the folly 
of Epicurus and Chrysippus has set forth at large. And others say that all 
things are produced without external agency, and that the world is uncreated, 
and that nature is eternal; and have dared to give out that there is no 
providence of God at all, but maintain that God is only each man's conscience. 
And others again maintain that the spirit which pervades all things is God. But 
Plato and those of his school acknowledge indeed that God is uncreated, and the 
Father and Maker of all things; but then they maintain that matter as well as 
God is uncreated, and aver that it is coeval with God. But if God is uncreated 
and matter uncreated, God is no longer, according to the Platonists, the Creator 
of all things, nor, so far as their opinions hold, is the monarchy of God 
established. And further, as God, because He is uncreated, is also unalterable; 
so if matter, too, were uncreated, it also would be unalterable, and equal to 
God; for that which is created is mutable and alterable, but that which is 
uncreated is immutable and unalterable. And what great thing is it if God made 
the world out of existent materials? For even a human artist, when he gets 
material from some one, makes of it what he pleases. But the power of God is 
manifested in this, that out of things that are not He makes whatever He 
pleases; just as the bestowal of life and motion is the prerogative of no other 
than God alone. For even man makes indeed an image, but reason and breath, or 
feeling, he cannot give to what he has made. But God has this property in excess 
of what man can do, in that He makes a work, endowed with reason, life, 
sensation. As, therefore, in all these respects God is more powerful than man, 
so also in this; that out of things that are not He creates and has created 
things that are, and whatever He pleases, as He pleases. 
CHAP. V.--OPINIONS OF HOMER AND HESIOD CONCERNING THE GODS. 
So that the opinion of your philosophers and authors is discordant; for while 
the former have propounded the foregoing opinions, the poet Homer is found 
explaining the origin not only of the world, but also of the gods, on quite 
another hypothesis. For he says somewhere: - "Father of Gods, Oceanus, and she 
Who bare the gods, their mother Tethys, too, From whom all rivers spring, and 
every sea." 
In saying which, however, he does not present God to us. For who does not 
know that the ocean is water? But if water, then not God. God indeed, if He is 
the creator of all things, as He certainly is, is the creator both of the water 
and of the seas. And Hesiod himself also declared the origin, not only of the 
gods, but also of the world itself. And though he said that the world was 
created, he showed no inclination to tell us by whom it was created. Besides, he 
said that Saturn, and his sons Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto, were gods, though we 
find that they are later born than the world. And he also relates how Saturn was 
assailed in war by his own son Jupiter; for he says: - "His father Saturn he by 
might o'ercame, And 'mong th' immortals ruled with justice wise, And honours fit 
distributed to each. 
Then he introduces in his poem the daughters of Jupiter, whom he names Muses, 
and as whose suppliant he appears, desiring to ascertain from them how all 
things were made; for he says: - "Daughters of Jove, all hail! Grant me your aid 
That I in numbers sweet and well-arrayed, Of the immortal gods may sing the 
birth; Who of the starry heav'ns were born, and earth; Who, springing from the 
murky night at first, Were by the briny ocean reared and nursed. 
Tell, too, who form unto the earth first gave, And rivers, and the boundless 
sea whose wave Unwearied sinks, then rears its crest on high; And how was spread 
yon glittering canopy Of glistening stars that stud the wide-spread heaven. 
Whence sprang the gods by whom all good is given? 
Tell from their hands what varied gifts there came, Riches to some, to others 
wealth, or fame; How they have dwelt from the remotest time In many-nooked 
Olympus' sunny clime. 
These things, ye Muses, say, who ever dwell Among Olympian shades--since ye 
can tell: 
From the beginning there thy feet have strayed; Then tell us which of all 
things first was made. 

But how could the Muses, who are younger than the world, know these things? 
Or how could they relate to Hesiod [what was happening], when their father was 
not yet born? 
CHAP. VI.--HESIOD ON THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD. 
And in a certain way he indeed admits matter [as self-existent] and the 
creation of the world [without a creator], saying: - "First of all things was 
chaos made, and next Broad-bosom'd earth's foundations firm were fixed, Where 
safely the immortals dwell for aye, Who in the snowy-peak'd Olympus stay. 
Afterwards gloomy Tartarus had birth In the recesses of broad-pathwayed 
earth, And Love, ev'n among gods most beauteous still, Who comes all-conquering, 
bending mind and will, Delivering from care, and giving then Wise counsel in the 
breasts of gods and men. 
From chaos Erebus and night were born, From night and Erebus sprung air and 
morn. 
Earth in her likeness made the starry heaven, That unto all things shelter 
might be given, And that the blessed gods might there repose. 
The lofty mountains by her power arose, For the wood-nymphs she made the 
pleasant caves, Begot the sterile sea with all his waves, Loveless; but when by 
heaven her love was sought, Then the deep-eddying ocean forth she brought." 
And saying this, he has not yet explained by whom all this was made. For if 
chaos existed in the beginning, and matter of some sort, being uncreated, was 
previously existing, who was it that effected the change on its condition, and 
gave it a different order and shape? Did matter itself alter its own form and 
arrange itself into a world (for Jupiter was born, not only long after matter, 
but long after the world and many men; and so, too, was his father Saturn), or 
was there some ruling power which made it; I mean, of course, God, who also 
fashioned it into a world? Besides, he is found in every way to talk nonsense, 
and to contradict himself. For when he mentions earth, and sky, and sea, he 
gives us to understand that from these the gods were produced; and from these 
again [the gods] he declares that certain very dreadful men were sprung,--the 
race of the Titans and the Cyclopes, and a crowd of giants, and of the Egyptian 
gods,--or, rather, vain men, as Apollonides, surnamed Horapius, mentions in the 
book entitled Semenouthi, and in his other histories concerning the worship of 
the Egyptians and their kings, and the vain labours in which they engaged. 
CHAP. VII.--FABULOUS HEATHEN GENEALOGIES. 
Why need I recount the Greek fables,--of Pluto, king of darkness, of Neptune 
descending beneath the sea, and embracing Melanippe and begetting a cannibal 
son,--or the many tales your writers have woven into their tragedies concerning 
the sons of Jupiter, and whose pedigree they register because they were born 
men, and not gods? And the comic poet Aristophanes, in the play called "The 
Birds," having taken upon him to handle the subject of the Creation, said that 
in the beginning the world was produced from an egg, saying: - "A windy egg was 
laid by black-winged night At first." 
But Satyrus, also giving a history of the Alexandrine families, beginning 
from Philopator, who was also named Ptolemy, gives out that Bacchus was his 
progenitor; wherefore also Ptolemy was the founder of this family. Satyrus then 
speaks thus: That Dejanira was born of Bacchus and Althea, the daughter of 
Thestius; and from her and Hercules the son of Jupiter there sprang, as I 
suppose, Hyllus; and from him Cleodemus, and from him Aristomachus, and from him 
Temenus, and from him Ceisus, and from him Maron, and from him Thestrus, and 
from him Acous, and from him Aristomidas, and from him Caranus, and from him 
Coenus, and from him Tyrimmas, and from him Perdiccas, and from him Philip, and 
from him AEropus, and from him Alcetas, and from him Amyntas, and from him 
Bocrus, and from him Meleager, and from him Arsinoe, and from her and Lagus 
Ptolemy Soter, and from him and Arsinoe Ptolemy Euergetes, and from him and 
Berenice, daughter of Maga, king of Cyrene, Ptolemy Philopator. Thus, then, 
stands the relationship of the Alexandrine kings to Bacchus. And therefore in 
the Dionysian tribe there are distinct families: the Althean from Althea, who 
was the wife of Dionysus and daughter of Thestius; the family of Dejanira also, 
from her who was the daughter of Dionysus and Althea, and wife of 
Hercules;--whence, too, the families have their names: the family of Ariadne, 
from Ariadne, daughter of Minos and wife of Dionysus, a dutiful daughter, who 
had intercourse with Dionysus in another form; the Thestian, from Thestius, the 
father of Althea; the Thoantian, from Thoas, son of Dionysus; the Staphylian, 
from Staphylus, son of Dionysus; the Euaenian, from Eunous, son of Dionysus; the 
Maronian, from Maron, son of Ariadne and Dionysus;--for all these are sons of 
Dionysus. And, indeed, many other names were thus originated, and exist to this 
day; as the Heraclidae from Hercules, and the Apollonidae from Apollo, and the 
Poseidonii from Poseidon, and from Zeus the Dii and Diogenae. 

CHAP. VIII.--OPINIONS CONCERNING PROVIDENCE. 
And why should I recount further the vast array of such names and 
genealogies? So that all the authors and poets, and those called philosophers, 
are wholly deceived; and so, too, are they who give heed to them. For they 
plentifully composed fables and foolish stories about their gods, and did not 
exhibit them as gods, but as men, and men, too, of whom some were drunken, and 
others fornicators and murderers. But also concerning the origin of the world, 
they uttered contradictory and absurd opinions. First, some of them, as we 
before explained, main-mined that the world is uncreated. And those that said it 
was uncreated and self-producing contradicted those who propounded that it was 
created. For by conjecture and human conception they spoke, and not knowing the 
truth. And others, again, said that there was a providence, and destroyed the 
positions of the former writers. Aratus, indeed, says: - "From Jove begin my 
song; nor ever be The name unuttered: all are frill of thee; The ways and haunts 
of men; the heavens and sea: 
On thee our being hangs; in thee we move; All are thy offspring and the seed 
of Jove. 
Benevolent, he warns mankind to good, Urges to toil and prompts the hope of 
food. 
He tells where cattle best may graze, and where The soil, deep-furrowed, 
yellow grain will bear. 
What time the husbandman should plant or sow, 'Tis his to tell,' tis his 
alone to know." 
Who, then, shall we believe: Aratus as here quoted, or Sophocles, when he 
says: - "And foresight of the future there is none; 'Tis best to live at random, 
as one can"? 
And Homer, again, does not agree with this, for he says that virtue "Waxes or 
wanes in men as Jove decrees." 
And Simonides says:- "No man nor state has virtue save from God; Counsel 
resides in God; and wretched man Has in himself nought but his wretchedness." 
So, too, Euripides:- "Apart from God, there's nothing owned by men." 
And Menander:- "Save God alone, there's none for us provides." 
And Euripides again:- "For when God wills to save, all things He'll bend To 
serve as instruments to work His end." 
And Thestius:- "If God design to save you, safe you are, Though sailing in 
mid-ocean on a mat." 
And saying numberless things of a like kind, they contradicted themselves. At 
least Sophocles, who in another place denied Providence, says:- "No mortal can 
evade the stroke of God." 
Besides, they both introduced a multitude of gods, and yet spoke of a Unity; 
and against those who affirmed a Providence they maintained in opposition that 
there was no Providence. Wherefore Euripides says:- "We labour much and spend 
our strength in vain, For empty hope, not foresight, is our guide." 
And without meaning to do so, they acknowledge that they know not the truth; 
but being inspired by demons and puffed up by them, they spoke at their instance 
whatever they said. For indeed the poets,--Homer, to wit, and Hesiod, being, as 
they say, inspired by the Muses,--spoke from a deceptive fancy, and not with a 
pure but an erring spirit. And this, indeed, clearly appears from the fact, that 
even to this day the possessed are sometimes exorcised in the name of the living 
and true God; and these spirits of error themselves confess that they are demons 
who also formerly inspired these writers. But sometimes some of them wakened up 
in soul, and, that they might be for a witness both to themselves and to all 
men, spoke things in harmony with the prophets regarding the monarchy of God, 
and the judgment and such like. 
CHAP. IX.--THE PROPHET'S INSPIRED BY THE HOLY GHOST. 
But men of God carrying in them a holy spirit and becoming prophets, being 
inspired and made wise by God, became God-taught, and holy, and righteous. 
Wherefore they were also deemed worthy of receiving this reward, that they 
should become instruments of God, and contain the wisdom that is from Him, 
through which wisdom they uttered both what regarded the creation of the world 
and all other things. For they predicted also pestilences, and famines, and 
wars. And there was not one or two, but many, at various times and seasons among 
the Hebrews; and also among the Greeks there was the Sibyl; and they all have 
spoken things consistent and harmonious with each other, both what happened 
before them and what happened in their own time, and what things are now being 
fulfilled in our own day: wherefore we are persuaded also concerning the future 
things that they will fall out, as also the first have been accomplished. 
CHAP. X.--THE WORLD CREATED BY GOD THROUGH THE WORD. 
And first, they taught us with one consent that 
God made all things out of nothing; for nothing was coeval with God: but He 
being His own place, and wanting nothing, and existing before the ages, willed 
to make man by whom He might be known; for him, therefore, He prepared the 
world. For he that is created is also needy; but he that is uncreated stands in 
need of nothing. God, then, having His own Word internal within His own bowels, 
begat Him, emitting Him along with His own wisdom before all things. He had this 
Word as a helper in the things that were created by Him, and by Him He made all 
things. He is called "governing principle" [arkh], because He rules, and 
is Lord of all things fashioned by Him. He, then, being Spirit of God, and 
governing principle, and wisdom, and power of the highest, came down upon the 
prophets, and through them spoke of the creation of the world and of all other 
things. For the prophets were not when the world came into existence, but the 
wisdom of God which was in Him, and His holy Word which was always present with 
Him. Wherefore He speaks thus by the prophet Solomon: "When He prepared the 
heavens I was there, and when He appointed the foundations of the earth I was by 
Him as one brought up with Him." And Moses, who lived many years before Solomon, 
or, rather, the Word of God by him as by an instrument, says, "In the beginning 
God created the heaven and the earth." First he named the "beginning," and 
"creation," then he thus introduced God; for not lightly and on slight occasion 
is it right to name God. For the divine wisdom foreknew that some would trifle 
and name a multitude of gods that do not exist. In order, therefore, that the 
living God might be known by His works, and that [it might be known that] by His 
Word God created the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, he said, 
"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." Then having spoken of 
their creation, he explains to us: "And the earth was without form, and void, 
and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God moved upon the 
water." This, sacred Scripture teaches at the outset, to show that matter, from 
which God made and fashioned the world, was in some manner created, being 
produced by God. 
CHAP. XI.--THE SIX DAYS' WORK DESCRIBED. 
Now, the beginning of the creation is light; since light manifests the things 
that are created. Wherefore it is said: "And God said, Let light be, and light 
was; and God saw the light, that it was good," manifestly made good for man. 
"And God divided the light from the darkness; and God called the light Day, and 
the darkness He called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first 
day. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let 
it divide the waters from the waters: and it was so. And God made the firmament, 
and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were 
above the firmament. And God called the firmament Heaven: and God saw that it 
was good. And the evening and the morning were the second day. And God said, Let 
the water under the heaven be gathered into one place, and let the dry land 
appear: and it was so. And the waters were gathered together into their places, 
and the dry land appeared. And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering 
together of the waters He called Seas: and God saw that it was good. And God 
said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed after his kind and 
in his likeness, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is 
in itself, in his likeness: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, 
the herb yielding seed after his kind, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit, whose 
seed was in itself, after his kind, on the earth: and God saw that it was good. 
And the evening and the morning were the third day. And God said, Let there be 
lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light on earth, to divide the day 
from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and 
for years; and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give 
light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater 
light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: He made the stars 
also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the 
earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from 
the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were 
the fourth day. And God said, Let the waters bring forth the creeping things 
that have life, and fowl flying over the earth in the firmament of heaven: and 
it was so. And God created great whales, and every living creature that 
creepeth, which the waters brought forth after their kind and every winged fowl 
after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them saying, 
Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea, and let fowl multiply in 
the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. And God said, Let 
the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping 
thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the 
beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and all 
the creeping things of the earth. And God said, Let us make man in our image, 
after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and 
over the fowl of the heaven, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and 
over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. And God created man: in 
the image of God created He him; male and female created He them. And God 
blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and 
subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the 
heaven, and over all cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creeping 
things that creep upon the earth. And God said, Behold I have given you every 
herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in 
the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat, and 
to all the beasts of the earth, and to all the fowls of heaven, and to every 
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, which has in it the breath of life; 
every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw everything that He had 
made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the 
sixth day. And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 
And on the sixth day God finished His works which He made, and rested on the 
seventh day from all His works which He made. And God blessed the seventh day, 
and sanctified it; because in it He rested from all His works which God began to 
create." 
CHAP. XII.--THE GLORY OF THE SIX DAYS' WORK. 
Of this six days' work no man can give a worthy explanation and description 
of all its parts, not though he had ten thousand tongues and ten thousand 
mouths; nay, though he were to live ten thousand years, sojourning in this life, 
not even so could he utter anything worthy of these things, on account of the 
exceeding greatness and riches of the wisdom of God which there is in the six 
days' work above narrated. Many writers indeed have imitated [the narration], 
and essayed to give an explanation of these things; yet, though they thence 
derived some suggestions, both concerning the creation of the world and the 
nature of man, they have emitted no slightest spark of truth. And the utterances 
of the philosophers, and writers, and poets have an appearance of 
trustworthiness, on account of the beauty of their diction; but their discourse 
is proved to be foolish and idle, because the multitude of their nonsensical 
frivolities is very great; and not a stray morsel of truth is found in them. For 
even if any truth seems to have been uttered by them, it has a mixture of error. 
And as a deleterious drug, when mixed with honey or wine, or some other thing, 
makes the whole [mixture] hurtful and profitless; so also eloquence is in their 
case found to be labour in vain; yea, rather an injurious thing to those who 
credit it. Moreover, [they spoke] concerning the seventh day, which all men 
acknowledge; but the most know not that what among the Hebrews is called the 
"Sabbath," is translated into Greek the "Seventh" (ebdomas), a name which 
is adopted by every nation, although they know not the reason of the 
appellation. And as for what the poet Hesiod says of Erebus being produced from 
chaos, as well as the earth and love which lords it over his [Hesiod's] gods and 
men, his dictum is shown to be idle and frigid, and quite foreign to the truth. 
For it is not meet that God be conquered by pleasure; since even men of 
temperance abstain from all base pleasure and wicked lust. 
CHAP. XIII.--REMARKS ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD. 
Moreover, his [Hesiod's] human, and mean, and very weak conception, so far as 
regards God, is discovered in his beginning to relate the creation of all things 
from the earthly things here below. For man, being below, begins to build from 
the earth, and cannot in order make the roof, unless he has first laid the 
foundation. But the power of God is shown in this, that, first of all, He 
creates out of nothing, according to His will, the things that are made. "For 
the things which are impossible with men are possible with God." Wherefore, 
also, the prophet mentioned that the creation of the heavens first of all took 
place, as a kind of roof, saying: "At the first God created the heavens"--that 
is, that by means of the "first" principle the heavens were made, as we have 
already shown. And by "earth" he means the ground and foundation, as by "the 
deep" he means the multitude of waters; and "darkness" he speaks of, on account 
of the heaven which God made coveting the waters and the earth like a lid. And 
by the Spirit which is borne above the waters, he means that which God gave for 
animating the creation, as he gave life to man, mixing what is fine with what is 
fine. For the Spirit is fine, and the water is fine, that the Spirit may nourish 
the water, and the water penetrating everywhere along with the Spirit, may 
nourish creation. For the Spirit being one, and holding the place of light, was 
between the water and the heaven, in order that the darkness might not in any 
way communicate with the heaven, which was nearer God, before God said, "Let 
there be light." The heaven, therefore, being like a dome-shaped covering, 
comprehended matter which was like a clod. And so another prophet, Isaiah by 
name, spoke in these words: "It is God who made the heavens as a vault, and 
stretched them as a tent to dwell in." The command, then, of God, that is, His 
Word, shining as a lamp in an enclosed chamber, lit up all that was under 
heaven, when He had made light apart from the world. And the light God called 
Day, and the darkness Night. Since man would not have been able to call the 
light Day, or the darkness Night, nor, indeed, to have given names to the other 
things, had not he received the nomenclature from God, who made the things 
themselves. In the very beginning, therefore, of the history and genesis of the 
world, the holy Scripture spoke not concerning this firmament [which we see], 
but concerning another heaven, which is to us invisible, after which this heaven 
which we see has been called "firmament," and to which half the water was taken 
up that it might serve for rains, and showers, and dews to mankind. And half the 
water was left on earth for rivers, and fountains, and seas. The water, then, 
covering all the earth, and specially its hollow places, God, through His Word, 
next caused the waters to be collected into one collection, and the dry land to 
become visible, which formerly had been invisible. The earth thus becoming 
visible, was yet without form. God therefore formed and adorned it with all 
kinds of herbs, and seeds and plants. 
CHAP. XIV.--THE WORLD COMPARED TO THE SEA. 
Consider, further, their variety, and diverse beauty, and multitude, and how 
through them resurrection is exhibited, for a pattern of the resurrection of all 
men which is to be. For who that considers it will not marvel that a fig-tree is 
produced from a fig-seed, or that very huge trees grow from the other very 
little seeds? And we say that the world resembles the sea. For as the sea, if it 
had not had the influx and supply of the rivers and fountains to nourish it, 
would long since have been parched by reason of its saltness; so also the world, 
if it had not had the law of God and the prophets flowing and welling up 
sweetness, and compassion, and righteousness, and the doctrine of the holy 
commandments of God, would long ere now have come to ruin, by reason of the 
wickedness and sin which abound in it. And as in the sea there are islands, some 
of them habitable, and well-watered, and fruitful, with havens and harbours in 
which the storm-tossed may find refuge,--so God has given to the world which is 
driven and tempest-tossed by sins, assemblies --we mean holy churches --in which 
survive the doctrines of the truth, as in the island-harbours of good anchorage; 
and into these run those who desire to be saved, being lovers of the truth, and 
wishing to escape the wrath and judgment of God. And as, again, there are other 
islands, rocky and without water, and barren, and infested by wild beasts, and 
uninhabitable, and serving only to injure navigators and the storm-tossed, on 
which ships are wrecked, and those driven among them perish,--so there are 
doctrines of error--I mean heresies --which destroy those who approach them. For 
they are not guided by the word of truth; but as pirates, when they have filled 
their vessels, drive them on the fore-mentioned places, that they may spoil 
them: so also it happens in the case of those who err from the truth, that they 
are all totally ruined by their error. 
CHAP. XV.--OF THE FOURTH DAY. 
On the fourth day the luminaries were made; because God, who possesses 
foreknowledge, knew the follies of the vain philosophers, that they were going 
to say, that the things which grow on the earth are produced from the heavenly 
bodies, so as to exclude God. In order, therefore, that the truth might be 
obvious, the plants and seeds were produced prior to the heavenly bodies, for 
what is posterior cannot produce that which is prior. And these contain the 
pattern and type of a great mystery. For the sun is a type of God, and the moon 
of man. And as the sun far surpasses the moon in power and glory, so far does 
God surpass man. And as the sun remains ever full, never becoming less, so does 
God always abide perfect, being full of all power, and understanding, and 
wisdom, and immortality, and all good. But the moon wanes monthly, and in a 
manner dies, being a type of man; then it is born again, and is crescent, for a 
pattern of the future resurrection. In like manner also the three days which 
were before the luminaries, are types of the Trinity, of God, and His Word, and 
His wisdom. And the fourth is the type of man, who needs light, that so there 
may be God, the Word, wisdom, man. Wherefore also on the fourth day the lights 
were made. The disposition of the stars, too, contains a type of the arrangement 
and order of the righteous and pious, and of those who keep the law and 
commandments of God. For the brilliant and bright stars are an imitation of the 
prophets, and therefore they remain fixed, not declining, nor passing from place 
to place. And those which hold the second place in brightness, are types of the 
people of the righteous. And those, again,, which change their position, and 
flee from place to place, which also are cared planets, they too are a type of 
the men who have wandered from God, abandoning His law and commandments. 
CHAP. XVI.--OF THE FIFTH DAY. 
On the fifth day the living creatures which proceed from the waters were 
produced, through: which also is revealed the manifold wisdom of God in these 
things; for who could count their multitude and very various kinds? Moreover, 
the things proceeding from the waters were blessed by God, that this also might 
be a sign of men's being destined to receive repentance and remission of sins, 
through the water and laver of regeneration,--as many as come to the truth, and 
are born again, and receive blessing from God. But the monsters of the deep and 
the birds of prey are a similitude of covetous men and transgressors. For as the 
fish and the fowls are of one nature,--some indeed abide in their natural state, 
and do no harm to those weaker than themselves, but keep the law of God, and eat 
of the seeds of the earth; others of them, again, transgress the law of God, and 
eat flesh, and injure those weaker than themselves: thus, too, the righteous, 
keeping the law of God, bite and injure none, but live holily and righteously. 
But robbers, and murderers, and godless persons are like monsters of the deep, 
and wild beasts, and birds of prey; for they virtually devour those weaker than 
themselves. The race, then, of fishes and of creeping things, though partaking 
of God's blessing, received no very distinguishing property. 
CHAP. XVII.--OF THE SIXTH DAY. 
And on the sixth day, God having made the quadrupeds, and wild beasts, and 
the land reptiles, pronounced no blessing upon them, reserving His blessing for 
man, whom He was about to create on the sixth day. The quadrupeds, too, and wild 
beasts, were made for a type of some men, who neither know nor worship God, but 
mind earthly things, and repent not. For those who turn from their iniquities 
and live righteously, in spirit fly upwards like birds, and mind the things that 
are above, and are well-pleasing to the will of God. But those who do not know 
nor worship God, are like birds which have wings, but cannot fly nor soar to the 
high things of God. Thus, too, though such persons are called men, yet being 
pressed down with sins, they mind grovelling and earthly-things. And the animals 
are named wild beasts [qhria], from their being hunted 
[qhreuesqai], not as if they had been made evil or venomous from the 
first--for nothing was made evil by God, but all things good, yea, very 
good,--but the sin in which man was concerned brought evil upon them. For when 
man transgressed, they also transgressed with him. For as, if the master of the 
house himself acts rightly, the domestics also of necessity conduct themselves 
well; but if the master sins, the servants also sin with him; so in like manner 
it came to pass, that in the case of man's sin, he being master, all that was 
subject to him sinned with him. When, therefore, man again shall have made his 
way back to his natural condition, and no longer does evil, those also shall be 
restored to their original gentleness. 
CHAP. XVIII.--THE CREATION OF MAN. 
But as to what relates to the creation of man, his own creation cannot be 
explained by man, though it is a succinct account of it which holy Scripture 
gives. For when God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness," He 
first intimates the dignity of man. For God having made all things by His Word, 
and having reckoned them all mere bye-works, reckons the creation of man to be 
the only work worthy of His own hands. Moreover, God is found, as if needing 
help, to say, "Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness." But to no one 
else than to His own Word and wisdom did He say, "Let Us make." And when He had 
made and blessed him, that he might increase and replenish the earth, He put all 
things under his dominion, and at his service; and He appointed from the first 
that he should find nutriment from the fruits of the earth, and from seeds, and 
herbs, and acorns, having at the same time appointed that the animals be of 
habits similar tom an's, that they also might eat of an the seeds of the earth. 
CHAP. XIX.--MAN IS PLACED IN PARADISE. 
God having thus completed the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and all 
that are in them, on the sixth day, rested on the seventh day from all His works 
which He made. Then holy Scripture gives a summary in these words: "This is the 
book of the generation of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in 
the day that the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and every green thing of 
the field, before it was made, and every herb of the field before it grew. For 
God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till 
the ground." By this He signifies to us, that the whole earth was at that time 
watered by a divine fountain, and had no need that man should till it; but the 
earth produced all things spontaneously by the command of God, that man might 
not be wearied by tilling it. But that the creation of man might be made plain, 
so that there should not seem to be an insoluble problem existing among men, 
since God had said, "Let Us make man;" and since His creation was not yet 
plainly related, Scripture teaches us, saying: "And a fountain went up out of 
the earth, and watered the face of the whole earth; and God made man of the dust 
of the earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a 
living soul." Whence also by most persons the soul is called immortal. And after 
the formation of man, God chose out for him a region among the places of the 
East, excellent for light, brilliant with a very bright atmosphere, [abundant] 
in the finest plants; and in this He placed man. 
CHAP. XX.--THE SCRIPTURAL ACCOUNT OF PARADISE. 
Scripture thus relates the words of the sacred history: "And God planted 
Paradise, eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed. And 
out of the ground made God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and 
good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of Paradise, and the tree of 
the knowledge of good and evil. And a river flows out of Eden, to water the 
garden; thence it is parted into four heads. The name of the first is Pison: 
that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; and 
the gold of that land is good, and there is bdellium and the onyx stone. And the 
name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land 
of Ethiopia. And the third river is Tigris: this is it which goeth toward Syria. 
And the fourth river is Euphrates. And the LORD 
God took the man whom He had made, and put him in the garden, to till and to 
keep it. And God commanded Adam, saying, Of every tree that is in the garden 
thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, ye 
shall not eat of it; for in the day ye eat of it ye shall surely die. And the 
LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; let Us make him an 
helpmeet for him. And out of the ground God formed all the beasts of the field, 
and all the fowls of heaven, and brought them to Adam. And whatsoever Adam 
called every living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names to 
all cattle, and to the fowls of the air, and to all the beasts of the field. But 
for Adam there was not found an helpmeet for him. And God caused an ecstasy to 
fall upon Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the 
flesh instead thereof. And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made 
He a woman, and brought her unto Adam. And Adam said, This is now bone of my 
bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken 
out of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall 
cleave unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. 
And they were both naked, Adam and his wife, and were not ashamed. 
CHAP. XXI.--OF THE FALL OF MAN. 
"Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD 
God had made. And the serpent said to the woman, Why hath God said, Ye shall not 
eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We eat of 
every tree of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of 
the garden God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, 
lest ye die. And the serpent Said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die. For 
God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, 
and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And the woman saw that the tree 
was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be 
desired to make one wise; and having taken of the fruit thereof, she did eat, 
and gave also unto her husband with her: and they did eat. And the eyes of them 
both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves 
together, and made themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of the LORD God 
walk ing in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid 
themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 
And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he 
said unto Him, I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was 
naked, and I hid myself. And He said unto him, Who told thee that thou wast 
naked, unless thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou 
shouldest not eat? And Adam said, The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she 
gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And God said to the woman, What is this that 
thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. And 
the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art 
accursed above all the beasts of the earth; on thy breast and belly shalt thou 
go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: and I will put enmity 
between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise 
thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. And to the woman He said, I will 
greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy travail: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth 
children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. 
And unto Adam He said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, 
and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat 
of it; cursed is the ground in thy works: in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the 
days of thy life; thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou 
shalt eat the herb of the field. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy 
bread, till thou return unto the earth; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust 
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." Such is the account given by holy 
Scripture of the history of man and of Paradise. 
CHAP. XXII.--WHY GOD IS SAID TO HAVE WALKED. 
You will say, then, to me: "You said that God ought not to be contained in a 
place, and how do you now say that He walked in Paradise?" Hear what I say. The 
God and Father, indeed, of all cannot be contained, and is not found in a place, 
for there is no place of His rest; but His Word, through whom He made all 
things, being His power and His wisdom, assuming the person of the Father and 
Lord of all, went to the garden in the person of God, and conversed with Adam. 
For the divine writing itself teaches us that Adam said that he had heard the 
voice. But what else is this voice but the Word of God, who is also His Son? Not 
as the poets and writers of myths talk of the sons of gods begotten from 
intercourse [with women], but as truth expounds, the Word, that always exists, 
residing within the heart of God. For before anything came into being He had Him 
as a counsellor, being His own mind and thought. But when God wished to make all 
that He determined on, He begot this Word, uttered, the first-born of all 
creation, not Himself being emptied of the Word [Reason], but having begotten 
Reason, and always conversing with His Reason. And hence the holy writings teach 
us, and all the spirit-bearing [inspired] men, one of whom, John, says, "In the 
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God," showing that at first God 
was alone, and the Word in Him. Then he says, "The Word was God; all things came 
into existence through Him; and apart from Him not one thing came into 
existence." The Word, then, being God, and being naturally produced from God, 
whenever the Father of the universe wills, He sends Him to any place; and He, 
coming, is both heard and seen, being sent by Him, and is found in a place. 
CHAP, XXIII.--THE TRUTH OF THE ACCOUNT IN GENESIS. 
Man, therefore, God made on the sixth day, and made known this creation after 
the seventh day, when also He made Paradise, that he might be in a better and 
distinctly superior place. And that this is true, the fact itself proves. For 
how can one miss seeing that the pains which women suffer in childbed, and the 
oblivion of their labours which they afterwards enjoy, are sent in order that 
the word of God may be fulfilled, and that the race of men may increase and 
multiply? And do we not see also the judgment of the serpent,--how hatefully he 
crawls on his belly and eats the dust,--that we may have this, too, for a proof 
of the things which were said aforetime? 
CHAP. XXIV.--THE BEAUTY OF PARADISE, 
God, then, caused to spring out of the earth every tree that is beautiful in 
appearance, or good for food. For at first there were only those things which 
were produced on the third day,--plants, and seeds, and herbs; but the things 
which were in Paradise were made of a superior loveliness and beauty, since in 
it the plants were said to have been planted by God. As to the rest of the 
plants, indeed, the world contained plants like them; but the two trees,--the 
tree of life and the tree of knowledge,--the rest of the earth possessed not, 
but only Paradise. And that Paradise is earth, and is planted on the earth, the 
Scripture states, saying: "And the LORD God planted Paradise in Eden eastwards, 
and placed man there; and out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree 
that is pleasant to the sight and good for food." By the expressions, therefore, 
"out of the ground," and "eastwards," the holy writing clearly teaches us that 
Paradise is under this heaven, under which the east and the earth are. And the 
Hebrew word Eden signifies "delight." And it was signified that a river flowed 
out of Eden to water Paradise, and after that divides into four heads; of which 
the two called Pison and Gihon water the eastern parts, especially Gihon, which 
encompasses the whole land of Ethiopia, and which, they say, reappears in Egypt 
under the name of Nile. And the other two rivers are manifestly recognisable by 
us--those called Tigris and Euphrates--for these border on our own regions. And 
God having placed man in Paradise, as has been said, to till and keep it, 
commanded him to eat of all the trees,--manifestly of the tree of life also; but 
only of the tree of knowledge He commanded him not to taste. And God transferred 
him from the earth, out of which he had been produced, into Paradise, giving him 
means of advancement, in order that, maturing and becoming perfect, and being 
even declared a god, he might thus ascend into heaven in possession of 
immortality. For man had been made a middle nature, neither wholly mortal, nor 
altogether immortal, but capable of either; so also the place, Paradise, was 
made in respect of beauty intermediate between earth and heaven. And by the 
expression, "till it," no other kind of labour is implied than the observance of 
God's command, lest, disobeying, he should destroy himself, as indeed he did 
destroy himself, by sin. 
CHAP. XXV.--GOD WAS JUSTIFIED IN FORBIDDING MAN TO EAT OF THE TREE OF 
KNOWLEDGE. 
The tree of knowledge itself was good, and its fruit was good. For it was not 
the tree, as some think, but the disobedience, which had death in it. For there 
was nothing else in the fruit than only knowledge;. but knowledge is good when 
one uses it discreetly. But Adam, being yet an infant in age, was on this 
account as yet unable to receive knowledge worthily. For now, also, when a child 
is born it is not at once able to eat bread, but is nourished first with milk, 
and then, with the increment of years, it advances to solid food. Thus, too, 
would it have been with Adam; for not as one who grudged him, as some suppose, 
did God command him not to eat of knowledge. But He wished also to make proof of 
him, whether he was submissive to His commandment. And at the same time He 
wished man, infant as he was, to remain for some time longer simple and sincere. 
For this is holy, not only with God, but also with men, that in simplicity and 
guilelessness subjection be yielded to parents. But if it is right that children 
be subject to parents, how much more to the God and Father of all things? 
Besides, it is unseemly that children in infancy be wise beyond their years; for 
as in stature one increases in an orderly progress, so also in wisdom. But as 
when a law has commanded abstinence from anything, and some one has not obeyed, 
it is obviously not the law which causes punishment, but the disobedience and 
transgression;--for a father sometimes enjoins on his own child abstinence from 
certain things, and when he does not obey the paternal order, he is flogged and 
punished on account of the disobedience; and in this case the actions themselves 
are not the [cause of] stripes, but the disobedience procures punishment for him 
who disobeys;--so also for the first man, disobedience procured his expulsion 
from Paradise. Not, therefore, as if there were any evil in the tree of 
knowledge; but from his disobedience did man draw, as from a fountain, labour, 
pain, grief, and at last fall a prey to death. 
CHAP. XXVI.--GOD'S GOODNESS IN EXPELLING MAN FROM PARADISE. 
And God showed great kindness to man in this, that He did not suffer him to 
remain in sin for ever; but, as it were, by a kind of banishment, cast him out 
of Paradise, in order that, having by punishment expiated, within an appointed 
time, the sin, and having been disciplined, he should afterwards be restored. 
Wherefore also, when man had been formed in this world, it is mystically written 
in Genesis, as if he had been twice placed in Paradise; so that the one was 
fulfilled when he was placed there, and the second will be fulfilled after the 
resurrection and judgment. For just as a vessel, when on being fashioned it has 
some flaw, is remoulded or remade, that it may become new and entire; so also it 
happens to man by death. For somehow or other he is broken up, that he may rise 
in the resurrection whole; I mean spotless, and righteous, and immortal. And as 
to God's calling, and saying, Where art thou, Adam? God did this, not as if 
ignorant of this; but, being long-suffering, He gave him an opportunity of 
repentance and confession. 
CHAP. XXVII.--THE NATURE OF MAN. 
But some one will say to us, Was man made by nature mortal? Certainly not. 
Was he, then, immortal? Neither do we affirm this. But one will say, Was he, 
then, nothing? Not even this hits the mark. He was by nature neither mortal nor 
immortal. For if He had made him immortal from the beginning, He would have made 
him God. Again, if He had made him mortal, God would seem to be the cause of his 
death. Neither, then, immortal nor yet mortal did He make him, but, as we have 
said above, capable of both; so that if he should incline to the things of 
immortality, keeping the commandment of God, he should receive as reward from 
Him immortality, and should become God; but if, on the other hand, he should 
turn to the things of death, disobeying God, he should himself be the cause of 
death to himself. For God made man free, and with power over himself. That, 
then, which man brought upon himself through carelessness and disobedience, this 
God now vouchsafes to him as a gift through His own philanthropy and pity, when 
men obey Him. For as man, disobeying, drew death upon himself; so, obeying the 
will of God, he who desires is able to procure for himself life everlasting. For 
God has given us a law and holy commandments; and every one who keeps these can 
be saved, and, obtaining the resurrection, can inherit incorruption. 
CHAP. XXVIII.--WHY EVE WAS FORMED OF ADAM'S RIB. 
And Adam having been cast out of Paradise, in this condition knew Eve his 
wife, whom God had formed into a wife for him out of his rib. And this He did, 
not as if He were unable to make his wife separately, but God foreknew that man 
would call upon a number of gods. And having this prescience, and knowing that 
through the serpent error would introduce a number of gods which had no 
existence,--for there being but one God, even then error was striving to 
disseminate a multitude of gods, saying, "Ye shall be as gods;"--lest, then, it 
should be supposed that one God made the man and another the woman, therefore He 
made them both; and God made the woman together with the man, not only that thus 
the mystery of God's sole government might be exhibited, but also that their 
mutual affection might be greater. Therefore said Adam to Eve, "This is now bone 
of my bones, and flesh of my flesh." And besides, he prophesied, saying, "For 
this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto 
his wife; and they two shall be one flesh;" which also itself has its fulfilment 
in ourselves. For who that marries lawfully does not despise mother and father, 
and his whole family connection, and all his household, cleaving to and becoming 
one with his own wife, fondly preferring her? So that often, for the sake of 
their wives, some submit even to death. This Eve, on account of her having been 
in the beginning deceived by the serpent, and become the author of sin, the 
wicked demon, who also is called Satan, who then spoke to her through the 
serpent, and who works even to this day in those men that are possessed by him, 
invokes as Eve. And he is called "demon" and "dragon," on account of his 
[apodedrakenai] revolting from God. For at first he was an angel. And 
concerning his history there is a great deal to be said; wherefore I at present 
omit the relation of it, for I have also given an account of him in another 
place. 
CHAP. XXIX.--CAIN'S CRIME. 
When, then, Adam knew Eve his wife, she conceived and bare a son, whose name 
was Cain; and she said, "I have gotten a man from God." And yet again she bare a 
second son, whose name was Abel, "who began to be a keeper of sheep, but Cain 
tilled the ground." Their history receives a very full narration, yea, even a 
detailed explanation: wherefore the book itself, which is entitled "The Genesis 
of the World," can more accurately inform those who are anxious to learn their 
story. When, then, Satan saw Adam and his wife not only still living, but also 
begetting children--being carried away with spite because he had not succeeded 
in putting them to death,--when he saw that Abel was well-pleasing to God, he 
wrought upon the heart of his brother called Cain, and caused him to kill his 
brother Abel. And thus did death get a beginning in this world, to find its way 
into every race of man, even to this day. But God, being pitiful, and wishing to 
afford to Cain, as to Adam, an opportunity of repentance and confession, said, 
"Where is Abel thy brother?" But Cain answered God contuma ciously, saying, "I 
know not; am I my brother's keeper?" God, being thus made angry with him, said, 
"What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the 
earth, which opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand. 
Groaning and trembling shalt thou be on the earth." From that time the earth, 
through fear, no longer receives human blood, no, nor the blood of any animal; 
by which it appears that it is not the cause [of death], but man, who 
transgressed. 
CHAP. XXX.--CAIN'S FAMILY AND THEIR INVENTIONS. 
Cain also himself had a son, whose name was Enoch; and he built a city, which 
he called by the name of his son, Enoch. From that time was there made a 
beginning of the building of cities, and this before the flood; not as Homer 
falsely says: - "Not yet had men a city built." 
And to Enoch was born a son, by name Gaidad; who begat a son called Meel; and 
Meel begat Mathusala; and Mathusala, Lamech. And Lamech took unto him two wives, 
whose names were Adah and Zillah. At that time there was made a beginning of 
polygamy, and also of music. For Lamech had three sons: Jabal, Jubal, Tubal. And 
Jabal became a keeper of cattle, and dwelt in tents; but Jubal is he who made 
known the psaltery and the harp; and Tubal became a smith, a forger in brass and 
iron. So far the seed of Cain is registered; and for the rest, the seed of his 
line has sunk into oblivion, on account of his fratricide of his brother. And, 
in place of Abel, God granted to Eve to conceive and bear a son, who was called 
Seth from whom the remainder of the human race proceeds until now. And to those 
who desire to be informed regarding all generations, it is easy to give 
explanations by means of the holy Scriptures. For, as we have already mentioned, 
this subject, the order of the genealogy of man, has been partly handled by us 
in another discourse, in the first book of The History. And all these things the 
Holy Spirit teaches us, who speaks through Moses and the rest of the prophets, 
so that the writings which belong to us godly people are more ancient, yea, and 
are shown to be more truthful, than all writers and poets. But also, concerning 
music, some have fabled that Apollo was the inventor, and others say that 
Orpheus discovered the art of music from the sweet voices of the birds. Their 
story is shown to be empty and vain, for these inventors lived many years after 
the flood. And what relates to Noah, who is called by some Deucalion, has been 
explained by us in the book before mentioned, and which, if you wish it, you are 
at liberty to read. 
CHAP. XXXI.--THE HISTORY AFTER THE FLOOD. 
After the flood was there again a beginning of cities and kings, in the 
following manner:--The first city was Babylon, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, 
in the land of Shinar. And their king was called Nebroth [Nimrod]. From these 
came Asshur, from whom also the Assyrians receive their name. And Nimrod built 
the cities Nineveh and Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen, between Nineveh and 
Calah; and Nineveh became a very great city. And another son of Shem, the son of 
Noah, by name Mizraim, begat Ludim, and those called Anamim, and Lehabim, and 
Naphtuhim, and Pathrusim, and Casluhim, out of whom came Philistin. Of the three 
sons of Noah, however, and of their death and genealogy, we have given a 
compendious register in the above-mentioned book. But now we will mention the 
remaining facts both concerning cities and kings, and the things that happened 
when there was one speech and one language. Before the dividing of the languages 
these fore-mentioned cities existed. But when men were about to be dispersed, 
they took counsel of their own judgment. and not at the instigation of God, to 
build a city, a tower whose top might reach into heaven, that they might make a 
glorious name to themselves. Since, therefore, they had dared, contrary to the 
will of God, to attempt a grand work, God destroyed their city, and overthrew 
their tower. From that time He confounded the languages of men, giving to each a 
different dialect. And similarly did the Sibyl speak, when she declared that 
wrath would come on the world. She says:- "When are fulfilled the threats of the 
great God, With which He threatened men, when formerly In the Assyrian land they 
built a tower, And all were of one speech, and wished to rise Even till they 
climbed unto the starry heaven, Then the Immortal raised a mighty wind And laid 
upon them strong necessity; For when the wind threw down the mighty tower, Then 
rose among mankind fierce strife and hate. 
One speech was changed to many dialects, And earth was filled with divers 
tribes and kings." 
And so on. These things, then, happened in the land of the Chaldaeans. And in 
the land of Canaan there was a city, by name Haran. And in these days, Pharaoh, 
who by the Egyptians was also called Nechaoth, was first king of Egypt, and thus 
the kings followed in succession. And in the land of Shinar, among those called 
Chal daeans, the first king was Arioch, and next after him Ellasar, and after 
him Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and after him Tidal, king of the nations called 
Assyrians. And there were five other cities in the territory of Ham, the son of 
Noah; the first called Sodom, then Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Balah, which 
was also called Zoar. And the names of their kings are these: Bera, king of 
Sodom; Birsha, king of Gomorrah; Shinab, king of Admah; Shemeber, king of 
Zeboiim; Bela, king of Zoar, which is also called Kephalac. These served 
Chedorlaomer, the king of the Assyrians, for twelve years, and in the thirteenth 
year they revolted from Chedorlaomer; and thus it came to pass at that time that 
the four Assyrian kings waged war upon the five kings. This was the first 
commencement of making war on the earth; and they destroyed the giants Karnaim, 
and the strong nations that were with them in their city, and the Horites of the 
mountains called Seir, as far as the plain of Paran, which is by the wilderness. 
And at that time there was a righteous king called Melchisedek, in the city of 
Salem, which now is Jerusalem. This was the first priest of all priests of the 
Most High God; and from him the above-named city Hierosolyma was called 
Jerusalem. And from his time priests were found in all the earth. And after him 
reigned Abimelech in Gerar; and after him another Abimelech. Then reigned 
Ephron, surnamed the Hittite. Such are the names of the kings that were in 
former times. And the rest of the kings of the Assyrians, during an interval of 
many years, have been passed over in silence unrecorded, all writers narrating 
the events of our recent days. There were these kings of Assyria: 
Tiglath-Pileser, and after him Shalmaneser, then Sennacherib; and Adrammelech 
the Ethiopian, who also reigned over Egypt, was his triarch;--though these 
things, in comparison with our books, are quite recent. 
CHAP. XXXII.--HOW THE HUMAN RACE WAS DISPERSED. 
Hence, therefore, may the loves of learning and of antiquity understand the 
history, and see that those things are recent which are told by us apart from 
the holy prophets. For though at first there were few men in the land of Arabia 
and Chaldaea, yet, after their languages were divided, they gradually began to 
multiply and spread over all the earth; and some of them tended towards the east 
to dwell there, and others to the parts of the great continent, and others 
northwards, so as to extend as far as Britain, in the Arctic regions. And others 
went to the land of Canaan, which is called Judaea, and Phoenicia, and the 
region of Ethiopia, and Egypt, and Libya, and the country called torrid, and the 
parts stretching towards the west; and the rest went to places by the sea, and 
Pamphylia, and Asia, and Greece, and Macedonia, and, besides, to Italy, and the 
whole country called Gaul, and Spain, and Germany; so that now the whole world 
is thus filled with inhabitants. Since then the occupation of the world by men 
was at first in three divisions,--in the east, and south, and west: afterwards, 
the remaining parts of the earth were inhabited, when men became very numerous. 
And the writers, not knowing these things, are forward to maintain that the 
world is shaped like a sphere, and to compare it to a cube. But how can they say 
what is true regarding these things, when they do not know about the creation of 
the world and its population? Men gradually increasing in number and multiplying 
on the earth, as we have already said, the islands also of the sea and the rest 
of the countries were inhabited. 
CHAP. XXXIII.--PROFANE HISTORY GIVES NO ACCOUNT OF THESE MATTERS. 
Who, then, of those called sages, and poets, and historians, could tell us 
truly of these things, themselves being much later born, and introducing a 
multitude of gods, who were born so many years after the cities, and are more 
modern than kings, and nations, and wars? For they should have made mention of 
all events, even those which happened before the flood; both of the creation of 
the world and the formation of man, and the whole succession of events. The 
Egyptian or Chaldaean prophets, and the other writers, should have been able 
accurately to tell, if at least they spoke by a divine and pure spirit, and 
spoke truth in all that was uttered by them; and they should have announced not 
only things past or present, but also those that were to come upon the world. 
And therefore it is proved that all others have been in error; and that we 
Christians alone have possessed the truth, inasmuch as we are taught by the Holy 
Spirit, who spoke in the holy prophets, and foretold all things. 
CHAP. XXXIV.--THE PROPHETS ENJOINED HOLINESS OF LIFE. 
And, for the rest, would that in a kindly spirit you would investigate divine 
things --I mean the things that are spoken by the prophets--in order that, by 
comparing what is said by us with the utterances of the others, you may be able 
to discover the truth. We have shown from their own histories, which they have 
compiled, that the names of those who are called gods, are found to be the names 
of men who lived among them, as we have shown above. And to this day their 
images are daily fashioned, idols, "the works of men's hands." And these the 
mass of foolish men serve, whilst they reject the maker and fashioner of all 
things and the nourisher of all breath of life, giving credit to vain doctrines 
through the deceitfulness of the senseless tradition received from their 
fathers. But God at least, the Father and Creator of the universe did not 
abandon mankind, but gave a law, and sent holy prophets to declare and teach the 
race of men, that each one of us might awake and understand that there is one 
God. And they also taught us to refrain from unlawful idolatry, and adultery, 
and murder, fornication, theft, avarice, false swearing, wrath, and every 
incontinence and uncleanness; and that whatever a man would not wish to be done 
to himself, he should not do to another; and thus he who acts righteously shall 
escape the eternal punishments, and be thought worthy of the eternal life from 
God. 
CHAP. XXXV.--PRECEPTS FROM THE PROPHETIC BOOKS. 
The divine law, then, not only forbids the worshipping of idols, but also of 
the heavenly bodies, the sun, the moon, or the other stars; yea, not heaven, nor 
earth, nor the sea, nor fountains, nor rivers, must be worshipped, but we must 
serve in holiness of heart and sincerity of purpose only the living and true 
God, who also is Maker of the universe. Wherefore saith the holy law: "Thou 
shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false 
witness; thou shalt not desire thy neighbour's wife." So also the prophets. 
Solomon indeed teaches us that we must not sin with so much as a turn of the 
eye, saying, "Let thine eyes look right on, and let thy eyelids look straight 
before thee." And Moses, who himself also was a prophet, says, concerning the 
sole government of God: "Your God is He who establishes the heaven, and forms 
the earth, whose hands have brought forth all the host of heaven; and has not 
set these things before you that you should go after them." And Isaiah himself 
also says: "Thus saith the LORD God who established the heavens, and founded the 
earth and all that is therein, and giveth breath unto the people upon it, and 
spirit to them that walk therein. This is the LORD your God." And again, through 
him He says: "I have made the earth, and man upon it. I by my hand have 
established the heavens." And in another chapter, "This is your God, who created 
the ends of the earth; He hungereth not, neither is weary, and there is no 
searching of His understanding." So, too, Jeremiah says: "Who hath made the 
earth by His power, and established the world by His wisdom, and by His 
discretion hath stretched out the heavens, and a mass of water in the heavens, 
and He caused the clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; He made 
lightnings with rain, and brought forth winds out of His treasures." One can see 
how consistently and harmoniously all the prophets spoke, having given utterance 
through one and the same spirit concerning the unity of God, and the creation of 
the world, and the formation of man. Moreover, they were in sore travail, 
bewailing the godless race of men, and they reproached those, who seemed to be 
wise, for their error and hardness of heart. Jeremiah, indeed, said: "Every man 
is brutishly gone astray from the knowledge of Him; every founder is confounded 
by his graven images; in vain the silversmith makes his molten images; there is 
no breath in them: in the day of their visitation they shall perish." The same, 
too, says David: "They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; there is 
none that doeth good, no, not one; they have all gone aside, they have together 
become profitless." So also Habakkuk: "What profiteth the graven image that he 
has graven it a lying image? Woe to him that saith to the stone, Awake; and to 
the wood, Arise." Likewise spoke the other prophets of the truth. And why should 
I recount the multitude of prophets, who are numerous, and said ten thousand 
things consistently and harmoniously? For those who desire it, can, by reading 
what they uttered, accurately understand the truth, and no longer be carried 
away by opinion and profitless labour. These, then, whom we have already 
mentioned, were prophets among the Hebrews,--illiterate, and shepherds, and 
uneducated. 
CHAP. XXXVI.--PROPHECIES OF THE SIBYL. 
And the Sibyl, who was a prophetess among the Greeks and the other nations, 
in the beginning of her prophecy, reproaches the race of men, saying:- 
"How are ye still so quickly lifted up, And how so thoughtless of the end of 
life, Ye mortal men of flesh, who are but nought? 
Do ye not tremble, nor fear God most high? 
Your Overseer, the Knower, Seer of all, Who ever keeps those whom His hand 
first made, Puts His sweet Spirit into all His works, And gives Him for a guide 
to mortal men. 
There is one only uncreated God, Who reigns alone, all-powerfuL very great, 
From whom is nothing hid. He sees all things, Himself unseen by any mortal eye. 
Can mortal man see the immortal God, Or fleshly eyes, which Shun the noontide 
beams, Look upon Him who dwells beyond the heavens? 
Worship Him then, the self-existent God, The unbegotten Ruler of the world, 
Who only was from everlasting time, And shall to everlasting still abide. 
Of evil counsels ye shall reap the fruit, Because ye have not honoured the 
true God, Nor offered to Him sacred hecatombs. 
To those who dwell in Hades ye make gifts, And unto demons offer sacrifice. 
In madness and in pride ye have your walk; And leaving the right way, ye 
wander wide, And lose yourselves in pitfalls and in thorns. 
Why do ye wander thus, O foolish men? 
Cease your vain wanderings in the black, dark night; Why follow darkness and 
perpetual gloom When, see, there shines for you the blessed light? 
Lo, He is clear--in Him there is no spot. 
Turn, then, from darkness, and behold the day; Be wise, and treasure wisdom 
in your breasts. 
There is one God who sends the winds and rains, The earthquakes, and the 
lightnings, and the plagues, The famines, and the snow-storms, and the ice, And 
alI the woes that visit our sad race. 
Nor these alone, but all things else He gives, Ruling omnipotent in heaven 
and earth, And self-existent from eternity." 
And regarding those [gods] that axe said to have been born, she said:- "If 
all things that are born must also die, God cannot be produced by mortal man. 
But there is only Once, the All-Supreme, Who made the heavens, with all their 
starry host, The sun and moon; likewise the fruitful earth, With all the waves 
of ocean, and the hills, The fountains, and the ever flowing streams; He also 
made the countless multitude Of ocean creatures, and He keeps alive All creeping 
things, both of the earth and sea; And all the tuneful choir of birds He made, 
Which cleave the air with wings, and with shrill pipe Trill forth at morn their 
tender, clear-voiced song. 
Within the deep glades of the hills He placed A savage race of beasts; and 
unto men He made all cattle subject, making man The God-formed image, ruler over 
all, And putting in subjection to his sway Things many and incomprehensible. 
For who of mortals can know all these things? 
He only knows who made them at the first, He the Creator, incorruptible, Who 
dwells in upper air eternally; Who proffers to the good most rich rewards, And 
against evil and unrighteous men Rouses revenge, and wrath, and bloody wars, And 
pestilence, and many a tearful grief. 
O man exalted vainly--say why thus Hast thou so utterly destroyed thyself? 
Have ye no shame worshipping beasts for gods? 
And to believe the gods should steal your beasts, Or that they need your 
vessels--is it not Frenzy's most profitless and foolish thought? 
Instead of dwelling in the golden heavens, Ye see your gods become the prey 
of worms, And hosts of creatures noisome and unclean. 
O fools! ye worship serpents, dogs, and cats, Birds, and the creeping things 
of earth and sea, Images made with hands, statues of stone, And heaps of rubbish 
by the wayside placed. 
All these, and many more vain things, ye serve, Worshipping things 
disgraceful even to name: 
These are the gods who lead vain men astray, From whose mouth streams of 
deadly poison flow. 
But unto Him in whom alone is life, Life, and undying, everlasting light; Who 
pours into man's cup of life a Sweeter than sweetest honey to his taste,- Unto 
Him bow the head, to Him alone, And walk in ways of everlasting peace. 
Forsaking Him, ye all have turned aside, And, in your raving folly, drained 
the cup Of justice quite unmixed, pure, mastering, strong; And ye will not again 
be sober men, Ye will not come unto a sober mind, And know your God and King, 
who looks on all: 
Therefore, upon you burning fire shall come, And ever ye shall daily burn in 
flames, Ashamed for ever of your useless gods. 
But those who worship the eternal God, They shall inherit everlasting life, 
Inhabiting the blooming realms of bliss, And feasting on sweet food from starry 
heaven." 
That these things are true, and useful, and just, and profitable to all men, 
is obvious. Even the poets have spoken of the punishments of the wicked. 
CHAP. XXXVII.--THE TESTIMONIES OF THE POETS. 
And that evil-doers must necessarily be punished in proportion to their 
deeds, has already been, as it were, oracularly uttered by some of the poets, as 
a witness both against themselves and against the wicked, declaring that they 
shall be punished. AEschylus said:- "He who has done must also suffer." 
And Pindar himself said:- "It is fit that suffering follow doing." 
So, too, Euripides:- "The deed rejoiced you--suffering endure; The taken 
enemy must needs be pain'd." 
And again:- "The foe's pain is the hero's raced." 
And, similarly, Archilochus:- "One thing I know, I hold it ever true, The 
evil-doer evil shall endure." 
And that God sees all, and that nothing escapes His notice, but that, being 
long-suffering, He refrains until the time when He is to judge-concerning this, 
too, Dionysius said:- "The eye of Justice seeing all, Yet seemeth not to see." 
And that God's judgment is to be, and that evils will suddenly overtake the 
wicked,--this, too, AEschylus declared, saying:- 
"Swift-looted is the approach of fate, And none can justice violate, But 
feels its stern hand soon or late. 
"'Tis with you, though unheard, unseen; You draw night's curtain in between, 
But even sleep affords no screen. 
"'Tis with you if you sleep or wake; And if abroad your way you take, Its 
still, stern watch you cannot break. 
"'Twill follow you, or cross your path; And even night no virtue hath To hide 
you from th' Avenger's wrath. 
"To show the ill the darkness flees; Then, if sin offers joy or ease, Oh 
stop, and think that some one sees!" 
And may we not cite Simonides also?- "To men no evil comes unheralded; But 
God with sudden hand transforms all things." 
Euripides again:- "The wicked and proud man's prosperity Is based on sand: 
his race abideth not; And time proclaims the wickedness of men." 
Once more Euripides:- "Not without judgment is the Deity, But sees when oaths 
are struck unrighteously, And when from men unwilling they are wrung." 
And Sophocles:- "If ills you do, ills also you must bear." 
That God will make inquiry both concerning false swearing and concerning 
every other wickedness, they themselves have well-nigh predicted. And concerning 
the conflagration of the world, they have, willingly or unwillingly, spoken in 
Conformity with the prophets, though they were much more recent, and stole these 
things from the law and the prophets. The poets corroborate the testimony of the 
prophets. 
CHAP. XXXVIlI. --THE TEACHINGS OF THE GREEK POETS AND PHILOSOPHERS 
CONFIRMATORY OF THOSE OF THE HEBREW PROPHETS. 
But what matters it whether they were before or after them? Certainly they 
did at all events utter things confirmatory of the prophets. Concerning the 
burning up of the world, Malachi the prophet foretold: "The day of the Lord 
cometh as a burning oven, and shall consume all the wicked." And Isaiah: "For 
the wrath of God is as a violent hail-storm, and as a rushing mountain torrent." 
The Sibyl, then, and the other prophets, yea, and the poets and philosophers, 
have clearly taught both concerning righteousness, and judgment, and punishment; 
and also concerning providence, that God cares for us, not only for the living 
among us, but also for those that are dead: though, indeed, they said this 
unwillingly, for they were convinced by the truth. And among the prophets 
indeed, Solomon said of the dead, "There shall be healing to thy flesh, and care 
taken of thy bones." And the same says David, "The hones which Thou hast broken 
shall rejoice." And in agreement with these sayings was that of Timocles:- "The 
dead are pitied by the loving God." 
And the writers who spoke of a multiplicity of gods came at length to the 
doctrine of the unity of God, and those who asserted chance spoke also of 
providence; and the advocates of impunity confessed there would be a judgment, 
and those who denied that there is a sensation after death acknowledged that 
there is.Homer, accordingly, though he had said,- "Like fleeting vision passed 
the soul away," says in another place:- "To Hades went the disembodied soul;" 
And again:- "That I may quickly pass through Hades' gates, Me bury." 
And as regards the others whom you have read, I think you know with 
sufficient accuracy how they have expressed themselves. But all these things 
will every one understand who seeks the wisdom of God, and is well pleasing to 
Him through faith and righteousness and the doing of good works. For one of the 
prophets whom we already mentioned, Hosea by name, said, "Who is wise, and he 
shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of 
the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall 
fall therein." He, then, who is desirous of learning, should learn much. 
Endeavour therefore to meet [with me] more frequently, that, by hearing the 
living voice, you may accurately ascertain the truth.
