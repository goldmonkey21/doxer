1 Thessalonians












1 Thessalonians. PaulÂ’s First Letter to the Thessalonians 

1:1Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the 
assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace 
to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
1:2We always give thanks to God for all of 
you, mentioning you in our prayers, 1:3remembering without ceasing your work of 
faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before 
our God and Father. 1:4We know, brothers loved by God, 
that you are chosen, 1:5and that our Gospel came to you not in 
word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance. 
You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake. 1:6You 
became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much 
affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit, 1:7so that you became an example to all who 
believe in Macedonia and in Achaia. 1:8For from you has sounded forth the word 
of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your 
faith toward God has gone forth; so that we need not to say anything. 1:9For 
they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you; 
and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God, 1:10and to wait for his Son from heaven, 
whom he raised from the dead-- Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come. 
2:1For you yourselves know, brothers, our 
visit to you wasn't in vain, 2:2but having suffered before and been 
shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we grew bold in our God to tell 
you the Gospel of God in much conflict. 2:3For our exhortation is not of error, nor 
of uncleanness, nor in deception. 2:4But even as we have been approved by God 
to be entrusted with the Gospel, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who 
tests our hearts. 2:5For neither were we at any time found 
using words of flattery, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness (God is 
witness), 2:6nor seeking glory from men (neither from 
you nor from others), when we might have claimed authority as apostles of 
Christ. 2:7But we were gentle among of you, as when 
a nurse cherishes her own children. 
2:8Even so, affectionately longing for you, 
we were well pleased to impart to you, not the Gospel of God only, but also our 
own souls, because you had become very dear to us. 2:9For you remember, 
brothers, our labor and travail; for working night and day, that we might not 
burden any of you, we preached to you the Gospel of God. 2:10You are witnesses 
with God, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you 
who believe. 2:11As you know how we exhorted, comforted, 
and implored every one of you, as a father does his own children, 2:12to 
the end that you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into his own Kingdom 
and glory. 2:13For this cause we also thank God 
without ceasing, that, when you received from us the word of the message of God, 
you accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, 
which also works in you who believe. 2:14For you, brothers, became imitators of 
the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also suffered 
the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews; 2:15who killed both the Lord Jesus and 
their own prophets, and drove us out, and didn't please God, and are contrary to 
all men; 2:16forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles 
that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always. But wrath has come on them 
to the uttermost. 
2:17But we, brothers, being bereaved of you 
for a short season, in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your 
face with great desire, 2:18because we wanted to come to 
you--indeed, I, Paul, once and again-- but Satan hindered us. 2:19For what is our hope, or joy, or crown 
of rejoicing? Isn't it even you, before our Lord Jesus* at 
his coming? 2:20For you are our glory and our joy. 
3:1Therefore, when we couldn't stand it any 
longer, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone, 3:2and sent Timothy, 
our brother and God's servant in the Gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to 
comfort you concerning your faith; 3:3that no one be moved by these 
afflictions. For you know that we are appointed to this task. 3:4For most assuredly, 
when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction, 
even as it happened, and you know. 3:5For this cause I also, when I couldn't 
stand it any longer, sent that I might know your faith, for fear that by any 
means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would have been in vain. 3:6But 
when Timothy came just now to us from you, and brought us glad news of your 
faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to see us, 
even as we also long to see you; 3:7for this cause, brothers, we were 
comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith. 3:8For 
now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord. 3:9For what 
thanksgiving can we render again to God for you, for all the joy with which we 
rejoice for your sakes before our God; 3:10night and day praying exceedingly that 
we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith? 3:11Now may our God and Father himself, and 
our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you; 3:12and the Lord make 
you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even 
as we also do toward you, 3:13to the end he may establish your hearts 
blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus 
with all his saints. 
4:1Finally then, brothers, we beg and 
exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk 
and to please God, that you abound more and more. 4:2For you know what 
charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus. 4:3For this is the will 
of God: your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality, 4:4that 
each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification 
and honor, 4:5not in the passion of lust, even as the 
Gentiles who don't know God; 4:6that no one should take advantage of and 
wrong a brother or sister in this matter; because the Lord is an avenger in all 
these things, as also we forewarned you and testified. 4:7For God called us 
not for uncleanness, but in sanctification. 4:8Therefore he who 
rejects doesn't reject man, but God, who has also given his Holy Spirit to you. 
4:9But concerning brotherly love, you have 
no need that one write to you. For you yourselves are taught by God to love one 
another, 4:10for indeed you do it toward all the 
brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, that you abound 
more and more; 4:11and that you make it your ambition to 
lead a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, 
even as we charged you; 4:12that you may walk properly toward those 
who are outside, and may have need of nothing. 
4:13But we don't want you to be ignorant, 
brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you don't grieve like 
the rest, who have no hope. 4:14For if we believe that Jesus died and 
rose again, even so those who have fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with 
him. 4:15For this we tell you by the word of the 
Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no 
way precede those who have fallen asleep. 4:16For the Lord 
himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, 
and with God's trumpet. The dead in Christ will rise first, 4:17then we who are 
alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet 
the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever. 4:18Therefore comfort 
one another with these words. 
5:1But concerning the times and the 
seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you. 5:2For 
you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the 
night. 5:3For when they are saying, "Peace and 
safety," then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a 
pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape. 5:4But you, brothers, 
aren't in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief. 5:5You 
are all children of light, and children of the day. We don't belong to the 
night, nor to darkness, 5:6so then let's not sleep, as the rest do, 
but let's watch and be sober. 5:7For those who sleep, sleep in the night, 
and those who are drunken are drunken in the night. 5:8But let us, since we 
belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, 
for a helmet, the hope of salvation. 5:9For God didn't appoint us to wrath, but 
to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 5:10who died for us, 
that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. 5:11Therefore exhort one another, and build 
each other up, even as you also do. 5:12But we beg you, brothers, to know those 
who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you, 5:13and to respect and honor them in love 
for their work's sake. 
Be at peace among yourselves. 5:14We exhort you, brothers, admonish the 
disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all. 
5:15See that no one returns evil for evil 
to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for 
all. 
5:16Rejoice always. 5:17Pray without 
ceasing. 5:18In everything give thanks, for this is 
the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you. 5:19Don't quench the 
Spirit. 5:20Don't despise prophesies. 5:21Test all things, and hold firmly that 
which is good. 5:22Abstain from every form of evil. 
5:23May the God of peace himself sanctify 
you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at 
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
5:24Faithful is he who calls you, who will 
also do it. 5:25Brothers, pray for us. 5:26Greet all the brothers with a holy 
kiss. 5:27I solemnly charge you by the Lord that 
this letter be read to all the holy brothers. 
5:28The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be 
with you. Amen.
