HIPPOLYTUS OF ROME
THE REFUTATION OF ALL HERESIES 
BOOK VII. 
CONTENTS. 
THE following are the contents of the seventh book of the Refutation of all 
Heresies :- What the opinion of Basilides is, and that, being struck with the 
doctrines of Aristotle, he out of these framed his heresy. 
And what are the statements of Saturnilus, who flourished much about the time 
of Basilides. 
And how Menander advanced the assertion that the world was made by angels. 
What is the folly of Marcion, and that his tenet is not new, nor (taken) out 
of the Holy Scriptures, but that he obtains it from Empedocles. 
How Carpocrates acts sillily, in himself also alleging that existing things 
were made by angels. 
That Cerinthus, in no wise indebted to the Scriptures, formed his opinion 
(not out of them), but from the tenets of the Egyptians. 
What are the opinions propounded by the Ebionaeans, and that they in 
preference adhere to Jewish customs. 
How Theodotus has been a victim of error, deriving contributions to his 
system partly from the Ebionaeans, (partly from Cerinthus.) 
And what were the opinions of Cerdon, who both enunciated the doctrines of 
Empedocles, and who wickedly induced Marcion to step forward. 
And how Lucian, when he had become a disciple of Marcion, having divested 
himself of all shame, blasphemed God from time to time. 
And Apelles also, having become a disciple of this (heretic), was not in the 
habit of advancing the same opinions with his preceptor; but being actuated (in 
the formation of his system) from the tenets of natural philosophers, assumed 
the substance of the universe as the fundamental principle of things. 
CHAP. I.--HERESY COMPARED TO THE STORMY OCEAN, THE ROCKS OF THE SIRENS; MORAL 
FROM ULYSSES AND THE SIRENS. 
The pupils of these men, when they perceive the doctrines of the heretics to 
be like unto the ocean when tossed into waves by violence of the winds, ought to 
sail past in quest of the tranquil haven. For a sea of this description is both 
infested with wild beasts and difficult of navigation, like, as we may say, the 
Sicilian (Sea), in which the legend reports were Cyclops, and Charybdis, and 
Scylla, and the rock of the Sirens. Now, the poets of the Greeks allege that 
Ulysses sailed through (this channel), adroitly using (to his own purpose) the 
terribleness of these strange monsters. For the savage cruelty (in the aspect) 
of these towards those who were sailing through was remarkable. The Sirens, 
however, singing sweetly and harmoniously, beguiled the voyagers, luring, by 
reason of their melodious voice, those who heard it, to steer their vessels 
towards (the promontory). The (poets) report that Ulysses, on ascertaining this, 
smeared with wax the ears of his companions, and, lashing himself to the mast, 
sailed, free of danger, past the Sirens, hearing their chant distinctly. And my 
advice to my readers is to adopt a similar expedient, viz., either on account of 
their infirmity to smear their ears with wax, and sail (straight on) through the 
tenets of the heretics, not even listening to (doctrines) that are easily 
capable of enticing them into pleasure, like the luscious lay of the Sirens, or, 
by binding one's self to the Cross of Christ, (and) hearkening with fidelity (to 
His words), not to be distracted, inasmuch as he has reposed his trust in Him to 
whom ere this he has been firmly knit, and (I admonish that man) to continue 
stedfastly (in this faith). 
CHAP. II.--THE SYSTEM OF BASILIDES DERIVED 
FROM ARISTOTLE. 
Since, therefore, in the six books preceding this, we have explained previous 
(heretical opinions), it now seems proper not to be silent respecting the 
(doctrines) of Basilides, which are the tenets of Aristotle the Stagyrite, not 
(those) of Christ. But even though on a former occasion the opinions propounded 
by Aristotle have been elucidated, we shall not even now scruple to set them 
down beforehand in a sort of synopsis, for the purpose of enabling my readers, 
by means of a nearer comparison of the two systems, to perceive with facility 
that the doctrines advanced by Basilides are (in reality) the clever quibbles of 
Aristotle. 
CHAP. III.--SKETCH OF ARISTOTLE'S PHILOSOPHY. 
Aristotle, then, makes a threefold division of substance. For one portion of 
it is a certain genus, and another a certain species, as that (philosopher) 
expresses it, and a third a certain individual. What is individual, however, (is 
so) not through any minuteness of body, but because by nature it cannot admit of 
any division whatsoever. The genus, on the other hand, is a sort of aggregate, 
made up of many and different germs. And from this genus, just as (from) a 
certain heap, all the species of existent things derive their distinctions. And 
the genus constitutes a competent cause for (the production of) all generated 
entities. In order, however, that the foregoing statement may be clear, I shall 
prove (my position) through an example. And by means of this it will be possible 
for us to retrace our steps over the entire speculation of the Peripatetic 
(sage). 
CHAP. IV.--ARISTOTLE'S GENERAL IDEA. 
We affirm the existence of animal absolutely, not some animal. And this 
animal is neither ox, nor horse, nor man, nor god; nor is it significant of any 
of these at all, but is animal absolutely. From this animal the species of all 
particular animals derive their subsistence. And this animality, itself the 
summum genus, constitutes (the originating principle) for all animals produced 
in those (particular) species, and (yet is) not (itself any one) of the things 
generated. For man is an animal deriving the principle (of existence) from that 
animality, and horse is an animal deriving the principle of existence from that 
animality. The horse, and ox, and dog, and each of the rest of the animals, 
derive the principle (of existence) from the absolute animal, while animality 
itself is not any of these. 
CHAP. V.--NONENTITY AS A CAUSE. 
If, however, this animality is not any of these (species), the subsistence, 
according to Aristotle, of the things that are generated, derived its reality 
from non-existent entities. For animality, from whence these singly have been 
derived, is not any one (of them); and though it is not any one of them, it has 
yet become some one originating principle of existing things. But who it is that 
has established this substance as an originating cause of what is subsequently 
produced, we shall declare when we arrive at the proper place for entertaining a 
discussion of this sort. 
CHAP. VI.--SUBSTANCE, ACCORDING TO ARISTOTLE; 
THE PREDICATES. 
Since, however, as I have stated, substance is threefold, viz., genus, 
species, (and) individual; and (since) we have set down animality as being the 
genus, and man the species, as being already distinct from the majority of 
animals, but notwithstanding still to be identified (with animals of his own 
kind), inasmuch as not being yet moulded into a species of realized substance,-- 
(therefore it is, that) when I impart form under a name to a man derived from 
the genus, I style him Socrates or Diogenes, or some one of the many 
denominations (in use). And since (in this way, I repeat,) I comprehend under a 
name the man who constitutes a species that is generated from the genus, I 
denominate a substance of this description individual. For genus has been 
divided into species, and species into individual. But (as regards) the 
individual, since it has been comprehended under a name, it is not possible 
that, according to its own nature, it could be divided into anything else, as we 
have divided each of the fore-mentioned (genus and species). 
Aristotle primarily, and especially, and preeminently entitles 
this--substance, inasmuch as it cannot either be predicated of any Subject, or 
exist in a Subject. He, however, predicates of the Subject, just as with the 
genus, what I said constituted animality, (and which is) predicated by means of 
a common name of all particular animals, such as ox, horse, and the rest that 
are placed under (this genus). For it is true to say that man is an animal, and 
horse an animal, and that ox is an animal, and each of the rest. Now the meaning 
of the expression "predicated of a Subject" is this, that inasmuch as it is one, 
it can be predicated in like manner of many (particulars), even though these 
happen to be diversified in species. For neither does horse nor ox differ from 
man so far forth as he is an animal, for the definition of animal is said to 
suit all animals alike. For what is an animal? If we define it, a general 
definition will comprehend all animals. For animal is an animated Substance, 
endued with Sensation. Such are ox, man, horse, and each of the rest (of the 
animal kingdom). But the meaning of the expression "in a Subject" is this, that 
what is inherent in anything, not as a part, it is impossible should exist 
separately from that in which it is. But this constitutes each of the accidents 
(resident) in Substance, and is what is termed Quality. Now, according to this, 
we say that certain persons are of such a quality; for instance, white, grey, 
black, just, unjust, temperate, and other (characteristics) similar to these. 
But it is impossible for any one of these to subsist itself by itself; but it 
must inhere in something else. If, however, neither animal which I predicate of 
all individual animals, nor accidents which are discoverable in all things of 
which they are nonessential qualities, can subsist themselves by themselves, and 
(yet if) individuals are formed out of these, (it follows, therefore, that) the 
triply divided Substance, which is not made up out of other things, consists of 
nonentities. If, then, what is primarily, and pre-eminently, and particularly 
denominated Substance consists of these, it derives existence from nonentities, 
according to Aristotle. 
CHAP. VII.--ARISTOTLE'S COSMOGONY; HIS "PSYCHOLOGY;" HIS "ENTELECHEIA;" HIS 
THEOLOGY; HIS ETHICS; BASILIDES FOLLOWS ARISTOTLE. 
But concerning Substance, the statements now made will suffice. But not only 
is Substance denominated genus, species, (and) individual, but also matter, and 
form, and privation. There is, however, (as regards the substance,) in these no 
difference, even though the division be allowed to stand. Now, inasmuch as 
Substance is of this description, the arrangement of the world has taken place 
according to some such plan as the following. The world is divided, according to 
Aristotle, into very numerous and diversified parts. Now the portion of the 
world which extends from the earth to the moon is devoid of foresight, 
guideless, and is under the sway of that nature alone which belongs to itself. 
But another (part of the world which lies) beyond the moon, and extends to the 
surface of heaven, is arranged in the midst of all order and foresight and 
governance. Now, the (celestial) superficies constitutes a certain fifth 
substance, and is remote from all those natural elements out of which the 
cosmical system derives consistence. And this is a certain fifth Substance, 
according to Aristotle,--as it were, a certain super-mundane essence. And (this 
essence) has become (a logical necessity) in his system, in order to accord with 
the (Peripatetic) division of the world. And (the topic of this fifth nature) 
constitutes a distinct investigation in philosophy. For there is extant a 
certain disquisition, styled A Lecture on Physical (Phenomena), in which he has 
elaborately treated concerning the operations which are conducted by nature and 
not providence, (in the quarter of space extending) from the earth as far as the 
moon. And there is also extant by him a certain other peculiar treatise on the 
principles of things (in the region) beyond the moon, and it bears the following 
inscription: Metaphysics. And another peculiar dissertation has been (written) 
by him, entitled Concerning a Fifth Substance, and in this work Aristotle 
unfolds his theological opinions. 
There exists some such division of the universe as we have now attempted to 
delineate in outline, and (corresponding with it is the division) of the 
Aristotelian philosophy. His work, however, (styled) Concerning the Soul, is 
obscure. For in the entire three books (where he treats of this subject) it is 
not possible to say clearly what is Aristotle's opinion concerning the soul. 
For, as regards the definition which he furnishes of soul, it is easy (enough) 
to declare this; but what it is that is signified by the definition is difficult 
to discover. For soul, he says, is an entelecheia of a natural organic body; 
(but to explain) what this is at all, would require a very great number of 
arguments and a lengthened investigation. As regards, however, the Deity, the 
Originator of all those glorious objects in creation, (the nature of) this 
(First Cause)--even to one conducting his speculations by a more prolonged 
inquiry than that concerning (the soul)--is more difficult to know than the soul 
itself. The definition, however, which Aris totle furnishes of the Deity is, I 
admit, not difficult to ascertain, but it is impossible to comprehend the 
meaning of it. For, he says, (the Deity) is a "conception of conception;" but 
this is altogether a non-existent (entity). 
The world, however, is incorruptible (and) eternal, according to Aristotle. 
For it has in itself nothing faulty, inasmuch as it is directed by Providence 
and Nature. And Aristotle has laid down doctrines not only concerning Nature and 
a cosmical system, and Providence, and God, but he has written (more than this); 
for there is extant by him likewise a certain treatise on ethical subjects, and 
these he inscribes Books of Ethics. But throughout these he aims at rendering 
the habits of his hearers excellent from being worthless. When, therefore, 
Basilides has been discovered, not in spirit alone, but also in the actual 
expressions and names, transferring the tenets of Aristotle into our evangelical 
and saving doctrine, what remains, but that, by restoring what he has 
appropriated from others, we should prove to the disciples of this (heretic) 
that Christ will in no wise profit them, inasmuch as they are heathenish? 
CHAP. VIII.--BASILIDES AND ISIDORUS ALLEGE APOSTOLIC SANCTION FOR THEIR 
SYSTEMS; THEY REALLY FOLLOW ARISTOTLE. 
Basilides, therefore, and Isidorus, the true son and disciple of Basilides, 
say that Matthias communicated to them secret discourses, which, I being 
specially instructed, he heard from the Saviour. Let us, then, see how clearly 
Basilides, simultaneously with Isidorus, and the entire band of these 
(heretics), not only absolutely belies Matthias, but even the Saviour Himself. 
(Time) was, says (Basilides), when there was nothing. Not even, however, did 
that nothing constitute anything of existent things; but, to express myself 
undisguisedly and candidly, and without any quibbling, it is altogether nothing. 
But when, he says, I employ the expression "was,"I do not say that it was; but 
(I speak in this way) in order to signify the meaning of what I wish to 
elucidate. I affirm then, he says, that it was "altogether nothing." For, he 
says, that is not absolutely ineffable which is named,--although undoubtedly we 
call this ineffable,--but that which is "non-ineffable." For that which is 
"non-ineffable" is not denominated ineffable, but is, he says, above every name 
that is named. For, he says, by no means for the world are these names 
sufficient, but so manifold are its divisions that there is a deficiency (of 
names). And I do not take it upon myself to discover, he says, proper 
denominations for all things. Undoubtedly, however, one ought mentally, not by 
means of names, to conceive, after an ineffable manner, the peculiarities (of 
things) denominated. For an equivocal terminology, (when employed by teachers,) 
has created for their pupils confusion and a source of error concerning objects. 
(The Basilidians), in the first instance, laying hold on this borrowed and 
furtively derived tenet from the Peripatetic (sage), play upon the folly of 
those who herd together with them. For Aristotle, born many generations before 
Basilides, first lays down a system in The Categories concerning homonymous 
words. And these heretics bring this (system) to light as if it were peculiarly 
their own, and as if it were some novel (doctrine), and some secret disclosure 
from the discourses of Matthias. 
CHAP. IX.--BASILIDES ADOPTS THE ARISTOTELIAN 
DOCTRINE OF "NONENTITY." 
Since, therefore, "nothing" existed,-- (I mean) not matter, nor substance, 
nor what is insubstantial, nor is absolute, nor composite, (nor conceivable, nor 
inconceivable, (nor what is sensible,) nor devoid of senses, nor man, nor angel, 
nor a god, nor, in short, any of those objects that have names, or are 
apprehended by sense, or that are cognised by intellect, but (are) thus 
(cognised), even with greater minuteness, still, when all things are absolutely 
removed,-- (since, I say, "nothing" existed,) God, "non-existent,"--whom 
Aristotle styles "conception of conception," but these (Basilidians) 
"non-existent,"-inconceivably, insensibly, indeterminately, involuntarily, 
impassively, (and) unactuated by desire, willed to create a world. Now I employ, 
he says, the expression "willed" for the purpose of signifying (that he did so) 
involuntarily, and inconceivably, and insensibly. 
And by the expression "world" I do not mean that which was subsequently 
formed according to breadth and division, and which stood apart; nay, (far from 
this,) for (I mean) the germ of a world. The germ, however, of the world had all 
things in itself. Just as the grain of mustard comprises all things 
simultaneously, holding them (collected) together within the very smallest 
(compass), viz. roots, stem, branches, leaves, and innumerable gains which are 
produced from the plant, seeds again of other plants, and frequently of others 
(still), that are produced (from them). In this way,"non-existent" God made the 
world out of nonentities, casting and depositing some one Seed that contained in 
itself a conglomeration of the germs of the world. But in order that I may 
render more clear what it is those (heretics) affirm, (I shall mention the 
following illustration of theirs.) As an egg of some variegated and 
particoloured bird,--for instance the peacock, or some other (bird) still more 
manifold and particoloured,--being one in reality, contains in itself numerous 
forms of manifold, and particoloured, and much compounded substances; so, he 
says, the nonexistent seed of the world, which has been deposited by the 
non-existent God, constitutes at the same time the germ of a multitude of forms 
and a multitude of substances. 
CHAP. X.--ORIGIN OF THE WORLD; BASILIDES' 
ACCOUNT OF THE "SONSHIP." 
All things, therefore whatsoever it is possible to declare, and whatever, 
being not as yet discovered, one must omit, were likely to receive adaptation to 
the world which was about to be generated from the Seed. And this (Seed), at the 
requisite seasons, increases in bulk in a peculiar manner, according to 
accession, as through the instrumentality of a Deity so great, and of this 
description. (But this Deity) the creature can neither express nor grasp by 
perception. (Now, all these things) were inherent, treasured in the Seed, as we 
afterwards observe in a new-born child the growth of teeth, and paternal 
substance, and intellect, and everything which, though previously having no 
existence, accrues unto a man, growing little by little, from a youthful period 
of life. But since it would be absurd to say that any projection of a 
non-existent God became anything non-existent (for Basilides altogether sirens 
and dreads the Substances of things generated in the way of projection for, (he 
asks,) of what sort of projection is there a necessity, or of what sort of 
matter must we assume the previous existence, in order that God should construct 
a world, as the spider his web; or a mortal man, for the purpose of working it, 
takes a (piece of) brass or of wood, or some other of the parts of matter?),-- 
(projection, I say, being out of the question,) certainly, says (Basilides), God 
spoke the word, and it was carried into effect. And this, as these men assert, 
is that which has been stated by Moses: 
"Let there be light, and there was light." Whence he says, came the light? 
From nothing. For it has not been written, he says, whence, but this only, 
(that it came) from the voice of him who speaks the word. And he who speaks the 
word, he says, was non-existent; nor was that existent which was being produced. 
The seed of the cosmical system was generated, he says, from nonentities; (and I 
mean by the seed,) the word which was spoken, "Let there be light." And this, he 
says, is that which has been stated in the Gospels: 
"He was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." 
He derives his originating principles from that Seed, and obtains from the same 
source his illuminating power. This is that seed which has in itself the entire 
conglomeration of germs. And Aristotle affirms this to be genius, and it is 
distributed by him into infinite species; just as from animal, which is 
non-existent, we sever ox, horse, (and) man. When, therefore, the cosmical Seed 
becomes the basis (for a subsequent development), those (heretics) assert, (to 
quote Basilides' own words:) "Whatsoever I affirm," he says, "to have been made 
after these, ask no question as to whence. For (the Seed) had all seeds 
treasured and reposing in itself, just as non-existent entities, and which were 
designed to be produced by a non-existent Deity." 
Let us see, therefore, what they say is first, or what second, or what third, 
(in the development of) what is generated from the cosmical Seed. There existed, 
he says, in the Seed itself, a Sonship, threefold, in every respect of the same 
Substance with the non-existent God, (and) begotten from nonentities, Of this 
Sonship (thus) involving a threefold division, one part was refined, (another 
gross,) and another requiring purification. The refined portion, therefore, in 
the first place, simultaneously with the earliest deposition of the Seed by the 
non-existent one, immediately burst forth and went upwards and hurried above 
from below, employing a sort of velocity described in poetry,- " . . . As wing 
or thought," - and attained, he says, unto him that is nonexistent. For every 
nature desires that (nonexistent one), on account of a superabundance of beauty 
and bloom. Each (nature desires this), however, after a different mode. The more 
gross portion, however, (of the Sonship) continuing still in the Seed, (and) 
being a certain imitative (principle), was not able to hurry upwards. For (this 
portion) was much more deficient in the refinement that the Sonship possessed, 
which through itself hurried upwards, (and so the more gross portion) was left 
behind. Therefore the more gross Sonship equipped it self with some such wing as 
Plato, the Preceptor of Aristotle, fastens on the soul in (his) Phoedrus. And 
Basilides styles such, not a wing, but Holy Spirit; and Sonship invested in this 
(Spirit) confers benefits, and receives them in turn. He confers benefits, 
because, as a wing of a bird, when removed from the bird, would not of itself 
soar high up and aloft; nor, again, would a bird, when disengaged from its 
pinion, at any time soar high up and aloft; (so, in like manner,) the Sonship 
involved some such relation in reference to the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit in 
reference to the Sonship. For the Sonship, carried upwards by the Spirit as by a 
wing, bears aloft (in turn) its pinion, that is, the Spirit. And it approaches 
the refined Sonship, and the non-existent God, even Him who fabricated the world 
out of nonentities. He was not, (however,) able to have this (spirit) with (the 
Sonship) itself; for it was not of the same substance (with God), nor has it 
(any) nature (in common) with the Sonship. But as pure and dry air is contrary 
to (their) nature, and destructive to fishes; so, in contrariety to the nature 
of the Holy Spirit, was that place simultaneously of non-existent Deity and 
Sonship,-- (a place) more ineffable than ineffable (entities), and higher up 
than all names. 
Sonship, therefore, left this (spirit) near that Blessed Place, which cannot 
be conceived or represented by any expression. (He left the spirit) not 
altogether deserted or separated from the Sonship; nay, (far from it,) for it is 
just as when a most fragrant ointment is put into a vessel, that, even though 
(the vessel) be emptied (of it) with ever so much care, nevertheless some odour 
of the ointment still remains, and is left behind, even after (the ointment) is 
separated from the vessel; and the vessel retains an odour of ointment, though 
(it contain) not the ointment (itself). So the Holy Spirit has continued without 
any share in the Sonship, and separated (from it), and has in itself, similarly 
with ointment, its own power, a savour of Sonship. 
And this is what has been declared: "As the ointment upon the head which 
descended to the beard of Aaron." This is the savour from the Holy Spirit borne 
down from above, as far as formlessness, and the interval (of space) in the 
vicinity of our world. And from this the Son began to ascend, sustained as it 
were, says (Basilides), upon eagles' wings, and upon the back. For, he says, all 
(entities) hasten upwards from below, from things inferior to those that are 
superior. For not one of those things that are among things superior, is so 
silly as to descend beneath. The third Sonship, however, that which requires 
purification, has continued, he says, in the vast conglomeration of all germs 
conferring benefits and receiving them. But in what manner it is that (the third 
Sonship) receives benefits and confers them, we shall afterwards declare when we 
come to the proper place for discussing this question. 
CHAP. XI.--THE "GREAT ARCHON" OF BASILIDES. 
When, therefore, a first and second ascension of the Sonship took place, and 
the Holy Spirit itself also remained after the mode mentioned, the firmament was 
placed between the super-mundane (spaces) and the world. For existing things 
were distributed by Basilides into two continuous and primary divisions, and 
are, according to him, denominated partly in a certain (respect) world, and 
partly in a certain (respect) super-mundane (spaces). But the spirit, a line of 
demarcation between the world and super-mundane (spaces), is that which is both 
holy, and has abiding in itself the savour of Sonship. While, therefore, the 
firmament which is above the heaven is coining into existence, there burst 
forth, and was begotten from the cosmical Seed, and the conglomeration of all 
germs, the Great Archon (and) Head of the world, (who constitutes) a certain 
(species of) beauty, and magnitude, and indissoluble power. For, says he, he is 
more ineffable than ineffable entities, and more potent than potent ones, and 
more wise than wise ones, and superior to all the beautiful ones whatever you 
could mention. This (Archon), when begotten, raised Himself up and soared aloft, 
and was carried up entire as far as the firmament. And there He paused, 
supposing the firmament to be the termination of His ascension and elevation, 
and considering that there existed nothing at all beyond these. And than all the 
subjacent (entities) whatsoever there were among them which remained mundane, He 
became more wise, more powerful, more comely, more lustrous, (in fact,) 
pre-eminent for beauty above any entities yon could mention with the exception 
of the Sonship alone, which is still left in the (conglomeration of) all germs. 
For he was not aware that there is (a Sonship) wiser and more powerful, and 
better than Himself. Therefore imagining Himself to be Lord, and Governor, and a 
wise Master Builder, He turns Himself to (the work of) the creation of every 
object in the cosmical system. And first, he deemed it proper not to be alone, 
but made unto Himself, and generated from adjacent (entities), a Son far 
superior to Him self, and wiser. For all these things had the non-existent Deity 
previously determined upon, when He cast down the (conglomeration of) all germs. 
Beholding, therefore, the Son, He was seized with astonishment, and loved (Him), 
and was struck with amazement. For some beauty of this description appeared to 
the Great Archon to belong to the Son, and the Archon caused Him to sit on his 
right (hand). This is, according to these (heretics), what is denominated the 
Ogdoad, where the Great Archon has his throne. The entire celestial creation, 
then, that is, the AEther, He Himself, the Great Wise Demiurge formed. The Son, 
however, begotten of this (Archon), operates in Him, and offered Him 
suggestions, being endued with far greater wisdom than the Demiurge Himself. 
CHAP. XII.--BASILIDES ADOPTS THE "ENTELECHEIA" OF ARISTOTLE. 
This, then, constitutes the entelecheia of the natural organic body, 
according to Aristotle, (viz.,) a soul operating in the body, without which the 
body is able to accomplish nothing; (I mean nothing) that is greater, and more 
illustrious, and more powerful, and more wise than the body. The account, 
therefore, which Aristotle has previously rendered concerning the soul and the 
body, Basilides elucidates as applied to the Great Archon and his Son. For the 
Archon has generated, according to Basilides, a son; and the soul as an 
operation and completion, Aristotle asserts to be an entelecheia of a natural 
organic hotly. As, therefore, the entelecheia controls the body, so the Son, 
according to Basilides, controls the God that is more ineffable than ineffable 
(entities). All things, therefore, have been provided for, and managed by the 
majesty of the Great Archon; (I mean) whatever objects exist in the aethereal 
region of space as far as the moon, for from that quarter onwards air is 
separated from aether. When all objects in the aethereal regions, then, were 
arranged, again from (the conglomeration of) all germs another Archon ascended, 
greater, of course, than all subjacent (entities) with the exception, however, 
of the Sonship that had been left behind, but far inferior to the First Archon. 
And this (second Archon) is called by them Rhetus. And this Topos is styled 
Hebdomad, and this (Archon) is the manager and fabricator of all subjacent 
(entities). And He has likewise made unto Himself out (of the conglomeration of) 
all germs, a son who is more prudent and wise than Himself, similarly to what 
has been stated to have taken place in the case of the First Archon. That which 
exists in this quarter (of the universe) constitutes, he says, the actual 
conglomeration and collection of all seeds; and the things which are generated 
are produced according to nature, as has been declared already by Him who 
calculates on things future, when they ought (to be), and what sort they ought 
(to be), and how they ought (to be). And of these no one is Chief, or Guardian, 
or Creator. For sufficient (cause of existence) for them is that calculation 
which the Non-Existent One formed when He exercised the function of creation. 
CHAP. XIII.--FURTHER EXPLANATION OF THE 
"SONSHIP." 
When, therefore, according to these (heretics), the entire world and 
super-mundane entities were finished, and (when) nothing exists labouring under 
deficiency, there still remains in the (conglomeration of) all germs the third 
Sonship, which had been left behind in the Seed to confer benefits and receive 
them. And it must needs be that the Sonship which had been left behind ought 
likewise to be revealed and reinstated above. And His place should be above the 
Conterminous Spirit, near the refined and imitative Sonship and the Non-Existent 
One. But this would be in accordance with what has been written, he says: "And 
the creation itself groaneth together, and travaileth in pain together, waiting 
for the manifestation of the sons of God." Now, we who are spiritual are sons, 
he says, who have been left here to arrange, and mould, and rectify, and 
complete the souls which, according to nature, are so constituted as to continue 
in this quarter of the universe. "Sin, then, reigned from Adam unto Moses," as 
it has been written. For the Great Archon exercised dominion and possesses an 
empire with limits extending as far as the firmament. And He imagines Himself 
alone to be God, and that there exists nothing above Him, for (the reason that) 
all things have been guarded by unrevealed Siope. This, he says, is the mystery 
which has not been made known to former generations; but in those days the Great 
Archon, the Ogdoad, was King and Lord, as it seemed, of the universe. But (in 
reality) the Hebdomad was king and lord of this quarter of the universe, and the 
Ogdoad is Arrhetus, whereas the Hebdomad is Rhetus. This, he says, is the Archon 
of the Hebdomad, who has spoken to Moses, and says: "I am the God of Abraham, 
and Isaac, and Jacob, and I have not manifested unto them the name of God" (for 
so they wish that it had been written)--that is, the God, Arrhetus, 
Archon of the Ogdoad. All the prophets, therefore, who were before the 
Saviour uttered their predictions, he says, from this source (of inspiration). 
Since, therefore, it was requisite, he says, that we should be revealed as the 
children of God, in expectation of whose manifestation, he says, the creation 
habitually groans and travails in pain, the Gospel came into the world, and 
passed through every Principality, and Power, and Dominion, and every Name that 
is named. And (the Gospel) came in reality, though nothing descended from above; 
nor did the blessed Sonship retire from that Inconceivable, and Blessed, (and) 
Non-Existent God. Nay, (far from it;) for as Indian naphtha, when lighted merely 
from a considerably long distance, nevertheless attracts fire (towards it), so 
from below, from the formlessness of the conglomeration (of all germs), the 
powers pass upwards as far as the Sonship. For, according to the illustration of 
the Indian naphtha, the Son of the Great Archon of the Ogdoad, as if he were 
some (sort of) naphtha, apprehends and seizes conceptions from the Blessed 
Sonship, whose place of habitation is situated after that of the Conterminous 
(Spirit). For the power of the Sonship which is in the midst of the Holy Spirit, 
(that is,) in, the midst of the (Conterminous) Spirit, shares the flowing and 
rushing thoughts of the Sonship with the Son of the Great Archon. 
CHAP. XIV.--WHENCE CAME THE GOSPEL; THE NUMBER OF HEAVENS ACCORDING TO 
BASILIDES; EXPLANATION OF CHRIST'S MIRACULOUS CONCEPTION. 
The Gospel then came, says (Basilides), first from the Sonship through the 
Son, that was seated beside the Archon, to the Archon, and the Archon learned 
that He was not God of the universe, but was begotten. But (ascertaining that) 
He has above Himself the deposited treasure of that Ineffable and Unnameable 
(and) Non-existent One, and of the Sonship, He was both converted and filled 
with terror, when He was brought to understand in what ignorance He was 
(involved). This, he says, is what has been declared: "The fear of the Lord is 
the beginning of wisdom." For, being orally instructed by Christ, who was seated 
near, he began to acquire wisdom, (inasmuch as he thereby) learns who is the 
Non-Existent One, what the Sonship, what the Holy Spirit, what the apparatus of 
the universe, and what is likely to be the consummation of things. This is the 
wisdom spoken in a mystery, concerning which, says (Basilides), Scripture uses 
the following expressions: "Not in words taught of human wisdom, but in (those) 
taught of the Spirit." The Archon, then, being orally instructed, and taught, 
and being (thereby) filled with fear, proceeded to make confession concerning 
the sin which He had committed in magnifying Himself. This, he says, is what is 
declared: "I have recognised my sin, and I know my transgression, (and) about 
this I shall confess for ever." When, then, the Great Archon had been orally 
instructed, and every creature of the Ogdoad had been orally instructed and 
taught, and (after) the mystery became known to the celestial (powers), it was 
also necessary that afterwards the Gospel should come to the Hebdomad, in order 
likewise that the Archon of the Hebdomad might be similarly instructed and 
indoctrinated into the Gospel. The Son of the Great Archon (therefore) kindled 
in the Son of the Archon of the Hebdomad the light which Himself possessed and 
had kindled from above from the Sonship. And the Son of the Archon of the 
Hebdomad had radiance imparted to Him, and He proclaimed the Gospel to the 
Archon of the Hebdomad. And in like manner, according to the previous account, 
He Himself was both terrified and induced to make confession. When, therefore, 
all (beings) in the Hebdomad had been likewise enlightened, and had the Gospel 
announced to them (for in these regions of the universe there exist, according 
to these heretics, creatures infinite (in number), viz., Principalities and 
Powers and Rulers, in regard of which there is extant among the (Basilidians) a 
very prolix and verbose treatise, where they allege that there are three hundred 
and sixty-five heavens, and that the great Archon of these is Abrasax, from the 
fact that his name comprises the computed number 365, so that, of course, the 
calculation of the title includes all (existing) things, and that for these 
reasons the year consists of so many days);--but when, he says, these (two 
events, viz., the illumination of the Hebdomad and the manifestation of the 
Gospel) had thus taken place, it was necessary, likewise, that afterwards the 
Formlessness existent in our quarter of creation should have radiance imparted 
to it, and that the mystery should be revealed to the Sonship, which had been 
left behind in Formlessness, just like an abortion. 
Now this (mystery) was not made known to previous generations, as he says, it 
has been written, "By revelation was made known unto me the mystery;" and, "I 
have heard inex pressible words which it is not possible for man to declare." 
The light, (therefore,) which came down from the Ogdoad above to the Son of the 
Hebdomad, descended from the Hebdomad upon Jesus the son of Mary, and he had 
radiance imparted to him by being illuminated with the light that shone upon 
him. This, he says, is that which has been declared: "The Holy Spirit will come 
upon thee," (meaning) that which proceeded from the Sonship through the 
conterminous spirit upon the Ogdoad and Hebdomad, as far as Mary; "and the power 
of the Highest will overshadow thee," (meaning) the power of the anointing, 
(which streamed) from the (celestial) height above (through) the Demiurge, as 
far as the creation, which is (as far as) the Son. And as far as that (Son) he 
says the world consisted thus. And as far as this, the entire Sonship, which is 
left behind for benefiting the souls in Formlessness, and for being the 
recipient in turn of benefits,-- (this Sonship, I say,) when it is transformed, 
followed Jesus, and hastened upwards, and came forth purified. 
And it becomes most refined, so that it could, as the first (Sonship), hasten 
upwards through its own instrumentality. For it possesses all the power that, 
according to nature, is firmly connected with the light which from above shone 
down (upon earth). 
CHAP. XV.--GOD'S DEALINGS WITH THE CREATURE; BASILIDES' NOTION OF THE INNER 
MAN, THE GOSPEL; HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE LIFE AND SUFFERINGS OF OUR LORD. 
When, therefore, he says, the entire Sonship shall have come, and shall be 
above the conterminous spirit, then the creature will become the object of 
mercy. For (the creature) groans until now, and is tormented, and waits for the 
manifestation of the sons of God, in order that all who are men of the Sonship 
may ascend from thence. When this takes place, God, he says, will bring upon the 
whole world enormous ignorance, that all things may continue according to 
nature, and that nothing may inordinately desire anything of the things that are 
contrary to nature. But (far from it); for all the souls of this quarter of 
creation, as many as possess the nature of remaining immortal in this (region) 
only, continue (in it), aware of nothing superior or better (than their present 
state). And there will not prevail any rumour or knowledge in regions below, 
concerning beings whose dwelling is placed above, lest subjacent souls should be 
wrung with torture from longing after impossibilities. (It would be) just as if 
a fish were to crave to feed on the mountains along with sheep. (For) a wish of 
this description would, he says, be their destruction. All things, therefore, 
that abide in (this) quarter are incorruptible, but corruptible if they are 
disposed to wander and cross over from the things that are according to nature. 
In this way the Archon of the Hebdomad will know nothing of superjacent 
entities. For enormous ignorance will lay hold on this one likewise, in order 
that sorrow, and grief, and groaning may depart from him; for he will not desire 
aught of impossible things, nor will he be visited with anguish. In like manner, 
however, the same ignorance will lay hold also on the Great Archon of the 
Ogdoad, and similarly on all the creatures that are subject unto him, in order 
that in no respect anything may desire aught of those things that are contrary 
to nature, and may not (thus) be overwhelmed with sorrow. And so there will be 
the restitution of all things which, in conformity with nature, have from the 
beginning a foundation in the seed of the universe, but will be restored at 
(their own) proper periods. And that each thing, says (Basilides), has its own 
particular times, the Saviour is a sufficient (witness when He observes, "Mine 
hour is not yet come." And the Magi (afford similar testimony) when they gaze 
wistfully upon the (Saviour's) star. For (Jesus) Himself was, he says, mentally 
preconceived at the time of the generation of the stars, and of the complete 
return to their starting-point of the seasons in the vast conglomeration (of all 
germs). This is, according to these (Basilidians), he who has been conceived as 
the inner spiritual man in what is natural (now this is the Sonship which left 
there the soul, not (that it might be) mortal, but that it might abide here 
according to nature, just as the first Sonship left above in its proper locality 
the Holy Spirit, (that is, the spirit) which is conterminous),-- (this, I say, 
is he who has been conceived as the inner spiritual man, and) has then been 
arrayed in his own peculiar soul. 
In order, however, that we may not omit any of the doctrines of this 
(Basilides), I shall likewise explain whatever statements they put forward 
respecting a gospel. For gospel with them, as has been elucidated, is of 
super-mundane entities the knowledge which the Great Archon did not understand. 
As, then, it was manifested unto him that there are likewise the Holy 
Spirit--that is, the conterminous (spirit)--and the Sonship, and the 
Non-Existent God, the cause of all these, he rejoiced at the communications made 
to him, and was filled with exultation. 

According to them, this constitutes the gospel. Jesus, however, was born, 
according to these (heretics), as we have already declared. And when the 
generation which has been previously explained took place, all the events in our 
Lord's life occurred, according to them, in the same manner as they have been 
described in the Gospels. And these things happened, he says, in order that 
Jesus might become the first-fruits of a distinction of the different orders (of 
created objects) that had been confused together. For when the world had been 
divided into an Ogdoad, which is the head of the entire world,--now the great 
Archon is head of the entire world,--and into a Hebdomad,--which is the head of 
the Hebdomad, the Demiurge of subjacent entities,--and into this order of 
creatures (that prevails) amongst us, where exists Formlessness, it was 
requisite that the various orders of created objects that had been confounded 
together should be distinguished by a separating process performed by Jesus. 
(Now this separation) that which was his corporeal part suffered, and this was 
(the part) of Formlessness and reverted into Formlessness. And that was 
resuscitated which was his psychical part, and this was (part) of the Hebdomad, 
and reverted into the Hebdomad. And he revived that (element in his nature) 
which was the peculiar property of the elevated region where dwells the Great 
Archon, and (that element) remained beside the Great Archon. And he carried 
upwards as far as (that which is) above that which was (the peculiar property) 
of the conterminous spirit, and he remained in the conterminous spirit. And 
through him there was purified the third Sonship, which had been left for 
conferring benefits, and receiving them. And (through Jesus) it ascended towards 
the blessed Sonship, and passed through all these. For the entire purpose of 
these was the blending together of, as it were, the conglomeration of all germs, 
and the distinction of the various orders of created objects, and the 
restoration into their proper component parts of things that had been blended 
together. Jesus, therefore, became the first-fruits of the distinction of the 
various orders of created objects, and his Passion took place for not any other 
reason than the distinction which was thereby brought about in the various 
orders of created objects that had been confounded together. For in this manner 
(Basilides) says that the entire Sonship, which had been left in Formlessness 
for the purpose of conferring benefits and receiving them, was divided into its 
component elements, according to the manner in which also the distinction of 
natures had taken place in Jesus. These, then, are the legends which likewise 
Basilides details after his sojourn in Egypt; and being instructed by the (sages 
of this country) in so great a system of wisdom, (the heretic) produced fruits 
of this description. 
CHAP. XVI.--THE SYSTEM OF SATURNILUS. 
But one Saturnilus, who flourished about the same period with Basilides, but 
spent his time in Antioch, (a city) of Syria, propounded opinions akin to 
whatever (tenets) Menander (advanced). He asserts that there is one Father, 
unknown to all--He who had made angels, archangels, principalities, (and) 
powers; and that by certain angels, seven (in number), the world was made, and 
all things that are in it. And (Saturnilus affirms) that man was a work of 
angels. There had appeared above from (the Being of) absolute sway, a brilliant 
image; and when (the angels) were not able to detain this, on account of its 
immediately, he says, returning with rapidity upwards, they exhorted one 
another, saying, "Let us make man in our likeness and image." And when the 
figure was formed, and was not, he says, able, owing to the impotence of the 
angels, to lift up itself, but continued writhing as a worm, the Power above, 
compassionating him on account of his having been born in its own image, sent 
forth a scintillation of life, which raised man up, and caused him to have 
vitality. (Saturnilus) asserts that this scintillation of life rapidly returns 
after death to those things that are of the same order of existence; and that 
the rest, from which they have been generated, are resolved into those. And the 
Saviour he supposed to be unbegotten and incorporeal, and devoid of figure. 
(Saturnilus,) however, (maintained that Jesus) was manifested as man in 
appearance only. And he says that the God of the Jews is one of the angels, and, 
on account of the Father's wishing to deprive of sovereignty all the Archons, 
that Christ came for the overthrow of the God of the Jews, and for the salvation 
of those that believe upon Him; and that these have in them the scintillation of 
life. For he asserted that two kinds of men had been formed by the angels,--one 
wicked, but the other good. And, since demons from time to time assisted wicked 
(men, Saturnilus affirms) that the Saviour came for the overthrow of worthless 
men and demons, but for the salvation of good men. And he affirms that marriage 
and procreation are from Satan. The majority, however, of those who belong to 
this (heretic's school) abstain from animal food likewise, (and) by this 
affectation of asceticism (make many their dupes). And (they maintain) that the 
prophecies have been uttered, partly by the world-making angels, and partly by 
Satan, who is also the very angel whom they suppose to act in antagonism to the 
cosmical (angels), and especially to the God of the Jews. These, then, are in 
truth the tenets of Saturnilus. 
CHAP. XVII,--MARCION; HIS DUALISM; DERIVES HIS SYSTEM FROM EMPEDOCLES; SKETCH 
OF THE DOCTRINE OF EMPEDOCLES. 
But Marcion, a native of Pontus, far more frantic than these (heretics), 
omitting the majority of the tenets of the greater number (of speculators), 
(and) advancing into a doctrine still more unabashed, supposed (the existence 
of) two originating causes of the universe, alleging one of them to be a certain 
good (principle), but the other an evil one. And himself imagining that he was 
introducing some novel (opinion), founded a school full of folly, and attended 
by men of a sensual mode of life, inasmuch as he himself was one of lustful 
propensities. This (heretic) having thought that the multitude would forget that 
he did not happen to be a disciple of Christ, but of Empedocles, who was far 
anterior to himself, framed and formed the same opinions,--namely, that there 
are two causes of the universe, discord and friendship. For what does Empedocles 
say respecting the plan of the world? Even though we have previously spoken (on 
this subject), yet even now also, for the purpose, at all events, of comparing 
the heresy of this plagiarist (with its source), we shall not be silent. 
This (philosopher) affirms that all the elements out of which the world 
consists and derives its being, are six: two of them material, (viz.,) earth and 
water; and two of them instruments by which material objects are arranged and 
altered, (viz.,) fire and air; and two of them, by means of the instruments, 
operating upon matter and fashioning it, viz., discord and friendship. 
(Empedocles) expresses himself somehow thus:- "The four roots of all things hear 
thou first: 
Brilliant Jove, and life-giving Juno and Aidoneus, And Nestis, who with tears 
bedews the mortal font." 
Jupiter is fire, and life-giving Juno earth, which produces fruits for the 
support of existence; and Aidoneus air, because although through him we behold 
all things, yet himself alone we do not see. But Nestis is water, for this is a 
sole vehicle of (food), and thus becomes a cause of sustenance to all those that 
are being nourished; (but) this of itself is not able to afford nutriment to 
those that are being nourished. For if it did possess the power of affording 
nutriment, animal life, he says, could never be destroyed by famine, inasmuch as 
water is always superabundant in the world. For this reason he denominates 
Nestis water, because, (though indirectly) being a cause of nutriment, it is not 
(of itself) competent to afford nutriment to those things that are being 
nourished. These, therefore--to delineate them as by way of outline--are the 
principles that comprise (Empedocles') entire theory of the world: (viz.,) water 
and earth, out of which (proceed) generated entities; fire and spirit, (which 
are) instruments and efficient (causes), but discord and friendship, which are 
(principles) artistically fabricating (the universe). And friendship is a 
certain peace, and unanimity, and love, whose entire effort is, that there 
should be one finished and complete world. 
Discord, however, invariably separates that one (world), and subdivides it, 
or makes many things out of one. Therefore discord is of the entire creation a 
cause which he styles "oulomenon," that is, destructive. For it is the concern 
of this (discord), that throughout every age the creation itself should continue 
to preserve its existing condition. And ruinous discord has been (thus) a 
fabricator and an efficient cause of the production of all generated entities; 
whereas friendship (is the cause) of the eduction, and alteration, and 
restoration of existing things into one system. And in regard of these (causes), 
Empedocles asserts that they are two immortal and unbegotten principles, and 
such as have not as yet received an originating cause of existence. (Empedocles) 
somewhere or other (expresses himself) in the following manner:- "For if both 
once it was, and will be; never, I think, Will be the age eternal void of both 
of these." 
(But) what are these (two)? Discord and Friendship; for they did not begin to 
come into being, but pre-existed and always will exist, because, from the fact 
of their being unbegotten, they are not able to undergo corruption. But fire, 
(and water,) and earth, and air, are (entities) that perish and revive. For when 
these generated (bodies), by reason of Discord, cease to exist, Friendship, 
laying hold on them, brings them forward, and attaches and associates them 
herself with the universe. (And this takes place) in order that the Universe may 
continue one, being always ordered by Friendship in a manner one and the same, 
and with (uninterrupted) uniformity. 
When, however, Friendship makes unity out of plurality, and associates with 
unity separated entities, Discord, again, forcibly severs them from unity, and 
makes them many, that is, fire, water, earth, air, (as well as) the animals and 
plants produced from these, and whatever portions of the world we observe. And 
in regard of the form of the world, what sort it is, arranged by Friendship, 
(Empedocles) expresses himself in the following terms:- "For not from back two 
arms arise, Not feet, not nimble knees, not genital groin, But a globe it was, 
and equal to itself it is." 
An operation of this description Friendship maintains, and makes (one) most 
beautiful form of the world out of plurality. Discord, however, the cause of the 
arrangement of each of the parts (of the universe), forcibly severs and makes 
many things out of that one (form). And this is what Empedocles affirms 
respecting his own generation:- "Of these I also am from God a wandering exile." 

That is, (Empedocles) denominates as God the unity and unification of that 
(one form) in which (the world) existed antecedent to the separation and 
production (introduced) by Discord among the majority of those things (that 
subsisted) in accordance with the disposition (effected) by Discord. For 
Empedocles affirms Discord to be a furious, and perturbed, and unstable 
Demiurge, (thus) denominating Discord the creator of the world. For this 
constitutes the condemnation and necessity of souls which Discord forcibly 
severs from unity, and (which it) fashions and operates upon, (according to 
Empedocles,) who expresses himself after some such mode as, the following:- "Who 
perjury piles on sin, While demons gain a life prolonged;" meaning by demons 
long-lived souls, because they are immortal, and live for lengthened ages:- "For 
thrice ten thousand years banished from bliss;" denominating as blissful, those 
that have been collected by Friendship from the majority of entities into the 
process of unification (arising out) of the intelligible world. He asserts that 
those are exiles, and that "In lapse of time all sorts of mortal men are born, 
Changing the irksome ways of life" 
He asserts the irksome ways to be the alterations and transfigurations of 
souls into (successive) bodies. This is what he says:- "Changing the irksome 
ways of life." 
For souls "change," body after body being altered, and punished by Discord, 
and not permitted to continue in the one (frame), but that the souls are 
involved in all descriptions of punishment by Discord being changed from body to 
body. He says:- "AEthereal force to ocean drives the souls, And ocean spurts 
them forth on earth's expanse, And earth on beams of blazing sun, who flings 
(The souls) on aether's depths, and each from each (A spirit) takes, and all 
with hatred burn." 
This is the punishment which the Demiurge inflicts, just as some brazier 
moulding (a piece of) iron, and dipping it successively from fire into water. 
For fire is the aether whence the Demiurge transfers the souls into the sea; and 
land is the earth: whence he uses the words, from water into earth, and from 
earth into air. This is what (Empedocles) says:- "And earth on beams Of blazing 
sun, who flings (the souls) 
On aether's depths, and each from each A (spirit) takes, and all with hatred 
burn." 
The souls, then, thus detested, and tormented, and punished in this world, 
are, according to Empedocles, collected by Friendship as being a certain good 
(power), and (one) that pities the groaning of these, and the disorderly and 
wicked device of furious Discord. And (likewise Friendship is) eager, and toils 
to lead forth little by little the souls from the world, and to domesticate them 
with unity, in order that all things, being conducted by herself, may attain 
unto unification. Therefore on account of such an arrangement on the part of 
destructive Discord of this divided world, Empedocles admonishes his disciples 
to abstain from all sorts of animal food. For he asserts that the bodies of 
animals are such as feed on the habitations of punished souls. And he teaches 
those who are hearers of such doctrines (as his), to refrain from intercourse 
with women. (And he issues this precept) in order that (his disciples) may not 
co-operate with and assist those works which Discord fabricates, always 
dissolving and forcibly severing the work of Friendship. Empedocles asserts that 
this is the greatest law of the management of the universe, expressing himself 
somehow thus:- "There's something swayed by Fate, the ancient, Endless law of 
gods, and sealed by potent oaths." 
He thus calls Fate the alteration from unity into plurality, according to 
Discord, and from plu rality into unity, according to Friendship. And, as I 
stated, (Empedocles asserts) that there are four perishable gods, (viz.,) fire, 
water, earth, (and) air. (He maintains,) however, that there are two (gods) 
which are immortal, unbegotten, (and) continually hostile one to the other, 
(namely) Discord and Friendship. And (he asserts) that Discord always is guilty 
of injustice and covetousness, and forcible abduction of the things of 
Friendship, and of appropriation of them to itself. (He alleges,) however, that 
Friendship, inasmuch as it is always and invariably a certain good (power), and 
intent on union, recalls and brings towards (itself), and reduces to unity, the 
parts of the universe that have been forcibly severed, and tormented, and 
punished in the creation by the Demiurge. Some such system of philosophy as the 
foregoing is advanced for us by Empedocles concerning the generation of the 
world, and its destruction, and its constitution, as one consisting of what is 
good and bad. And he says that there is likewise a certain third power which is 
cognised by intellect, and that this can be understood from these, (viz., 
Discord and Friendship,) expressing himself somehow thus:- "For if, 'neath 
hearts of oak, these truths you fix, And view them kindly in meditations pure, 
Each one of these, in lapse of time, will haunt you, And many others, sprung of 
these, descend. 
For into every habit these will grow, as Nature prompts; But if for other 
things you sigh, which, countless, linger Undisguised 'mid men, and blunt the 
edge of care, As years roll on they'll leave you fleetly, Since they yearn to 
reach their own beloved race; For know that all possess perception and a share 
of mind." 
CHAP. XVIII.--SOURCE OF MARCIONISM; EMPEDOCLES REASSERTED AS THE SUGGESTER OF 
THE HERESY. 
When, therefore, Marcion or some one of his hounds barks against the 
Demiurge, and adduces reasons from a comparison of what is good and bad, we 
ought to say to them, that neither Paul the apostle nor Mark, he of the maimed 
finger, announced such (tenets). For none of these (doctrines) has been written 
in the Gospel according to Mark. But (the real author of the system) is 
Empedocles, son of Meto, a native of Agrigentum. And (Marcion) despoiled this 
(philosopher), and imagined that up to the present would pass undetected his 
transference, under the same expressions, of the arrangement of his entire 
heresy from Sicily into the evangelical narratives. For bear with me, O Marcion: 
as you have instituted a comparison of what is good and evil, I also to-day will 
institute a comparison following up your own tenets, as you suppose them to be. 
You affirm that the Demiurge of the world is evil--why not hide your countenance 
in shame, (as thus) teaching to the Church the doctrines of Empedocles? You say 
that there is a good Deity who destroys the works of the Demiurge: then do not 
you plainly preach to your pupils, as the good Deity, the Friendship of 
Empedocles. You forbid marriage, the procreation of children, (and) the 
abstaining from meats which God has created for participation by the faithful, 
and those that know the truth. (Thinkest thou, then,) that thou canst escape 
detection, (while thus) enjoining the purificatory rites of Empedocles? For in 
point of fact you follow in every respect this (philosopher of paganism), while 
you instruct your own disciples to refuse meats, in order not to eat any body 
(that might be) a remnant of a soul which has been punished by the Demiurge. You 
dissolve marriages that have been cemented by the Deity. And here again you 
conform to the tenets of Empedocles, in order that for you the work of 
Friendship may be perpetuated as one (and) indivisible. For, according to 
Empedocles, matrimony separates unity, and makes (out of it) plurality, as we 
have proved. 
CHAP. XIX.--THE HERESY OF PREPON; FOLLOWS EMPEDOCLES; MARCION REJECTS THE 
GENERATION OF THE SAVIOUR. 
The principal heresy of Marcion, and (the one of his) which is most free from 
admixture (with other heresies), is that which has its system formed out of the 
theory concerning the good and bad (God). Now this, it has been manifested by 
us, belongs to Empedocles. But since at present, in our times, a certain 
follower of Marcion, (namely) Prepon, an Assyrian, has endeavoured to introduce 
something more novel, and has given an account of his heresy in a work inscribed 
to Bardesanes, an Armenian, neither of this will I be silent. In alleging that 
what is just constitutes a third principle, and that it is placed intermediate 
between what is good and bad, Prepon of course is not able to avoid (the 
imputation of inculcating) the opinion of Empedocles. For Empedocles asserts 
that the world is managed by wicked Discord, and that the other 
(world) which (is managed) by Friendship, is cognisable by intellect. And (he 
asserts) that these are the two different principles of good and evil, and that 
intermediate between these diverse principles is impartial reason, in accordance 
with which are united the things that have been separated by Discord, (and 
which,) in accordance with the influence of Friendship, are accommodated to 
unity. The impartial reason itself, that which is an auxiliary to Friendship, 
Empedocles denominates "Musa." And he himself likewise entreats her to assist 
him, and expresses himself somehow thus:- "For if on fleeting mortals, deathless 
Muse, Thy care it be that thoughts our mind engross, Calliope, again befriend my 
present prayer, As I disclose a pure account of happy gods." 
Marcion, adopting these sentiments, rejected altogether the generation of our 
Saviour. He considered it to be absurd that tinder the (category of a) creature 
fashioned by destructive Discord should have been the Logos that was an 
auxiliary to Friendship--that is, the Good Deity. (His doctrine,) however, was 
that, independent of birth, (the Logos) Himself descended from above in the 
fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, and that, as being intermediate 
between the good and bad Deity, He proceeded to give instruction in the 
synagogues. For if He is a Mediator, He has been, he says, liberated from the 
entire nature of the Evil Deity. Now, as he affirms, the Demiurge is evil, and 
his works. For this reason, he affirms, Jesus came down unbegotten, in order 
that He might be liberated from all (admixture of) evil. And He has, he says, 
been liberated from the nature of the Good One likewise, in order that He may be 
a Mediator, as Paul states, and as Himself acknowledges: "Why call ye me good? 
there is one good," These, then, are the opinions of Marcion, by means of which 
he made many his dupes, employing the conclusions of Empedocles. And he 
transferred the philosophy invented by that (ancient speculator) into his own 
system of thought, and (out of Empedocles) constructed his (own) impious heresy. 
But I consider that this has been sufficiently refuted by us, and that I have 
not omitted any opinion of those who purloin their opinions from the Greeks, and 
act despitefully towards the disciples of Christ, as if they had become teachers 
to them of these (tenets). But since it seems that we have sufficiently 
explained the doctrines of this (heretic), let us see what Carpocrates says. 
CHAP. XX.--THE HERESY OF CARPOCRATES; WICKED DOCTRINES CONCERNING JESUS 
CHRIST; PRACTISE MAGICAL ARTS; ADOPT A METEMPSYCHOSIS. 
Carpocrates affirms that the world and the things in it were made by angels, 
far inferior to the unbegotten Father; and that Jesus was generated of Joseph, 
and that, having been born similar to (other) men, He was more just than the 
rest (of the human race). And (Carpocrates asserts) that the soul (of Jesus), 
inasmuch as it was made vigorous and undefiled, remembered the things seen by it 
in its converse with the unbegotten God. And (Carpocrates maintains) that on 
this account there was sent down upon (Jesus) by that (God) a power, in order 
that through it He might be enabled to escape the world-making (angels). And (he 
says) that this power, having passed through all, and having obtained liberty in 
all, again ascended to God (Himself). 
And (he alleges) that in the same condition with (the soul of Jesus are all 
the souls) that embrace similar objects of desire with the (power just alluded 
to). And they assert that the soul of Jesus, (though,) according to law, it was 
disciplined in Jewish customs, (in reality) despised them. And (he says) that on 
this account (Jesus) received powers whereby, He rendered null and void the 
passions incidental to men for their punishment. And (he argues), therefore, 
that the (soul), which, similarly with that soul of Christ, is able to despise 
the world-making Archons, receives in like man-her power for the performance of 
similar acts. Wherefore, also, (according to Carpocrates, there are persons who) 
have attained unto such a degree of pride as to affirm some of themselves to be 
equal to Jesus Himself, whereas others among them to be even still more 
powerful. But (they also contend) that some enjoy an excellence above the 
disciples of that (Redeemer), for instance Peter and Paul, and the rest of the 
Apostles, and that these are in no respect inferior to Jesus. And (Carpocrates 
asserts) that the souls of these have originated from that supernal power, and 
that consequently they, as equally despising the world-making (angels), have 
been deemed worthy of the same power, and (of the privilege) to ascend to the 
same (place). If, however, any one would despise earthly concerns more than did 
that (Saviour, Carpocrates says) that such a one world he able to become 
superior to (Jesus, The followers of this heretic) practise their magical arts 
and incantations, and spells and volup tuous feasts. And (they are in the habit 
of invoking the aid of) subordinate demons and dream-senders, and (of resorting 
to) the rest of the tricks (of sorcery), alleging that they possess power for 
now acquiring sway over the Archons and makers of this world, nay, even over all 
the works that are in it. 
(Now these heretics) have themselves been sent forth by Satan, for the 
purpose of slandering before the Gentiles the divine name of the Church. (And 
the devil's object is,) that men hearing, now after one fashion and now after 
another, the doctrines of those (heretics), and thinking that all of us are 
people of the same stamp, may turn away their ears from the preaching of the 
truth, or that they also, looking, (without abjuring,) upon all the tenets of 
those (heretics), may speak hurtfully of us. (The followers of Carpocrates) 
allege that the souls are transferred from body to body, so far as that they may 
fill up (the measure of) all their sins. When, however, not one (of these sins) 
is left, (the Carpocratians affirm that the soul) is then emancipated, and 
departs unto that God above of the world-making angels, and that in this way all 
souls will be saved. If, however, some (souls), during the presence of the soul 
in the body for one life, may by anticipation become involved in the full 
measure of transgressions, they, (according to these heretics,) no longer 
undergo metempsychosis. (Souls of this sort,) however, on paying off at once all 
trespasses, will, (the Carpocratians say,) be emancipated from dwelling any more 
in a body. Certain, likewise, of these (heretics) brand their own disciples in 
the back parts of the lobe of the right ear. And they make counterfeit images of 
Christ, alleging that these were in existence at the time (during which our Lord 
was on earth, and that they were fashioned) by Pilate. 
CHAP. XXI.--THE SYSTEM OF CERINTHUS CONCERNING CHRIST. 
But a certain Cerinthus, himself being disciplined in the teaching of the 
Egyptians, asserted that the world was not made by the primal Deity, but by some 
virtue which was an offshoot from that Power which is above all things, and 
which (yet) is ignorant of the God that is above all. And he supposed that Jesus 
was not generated from a virgin, but that he was born son of Joseph and Mary, 
just in a manner similar with the rest of men, and that (Jesus) was more just 
and more wise (than all the human race). And (Cerinthus alleges) that, after the 
baptism (of our Lord), Christ in form of a dove came down upon him, from that 
absolute sovereignty which is above all things. And then, (according to this 
heretic,) Jesus proceeded to preach the unknown Father, and in attestation (of 
his mission) to work miracles. It was, however, (the opinion of Cerinthus,) that 
ultimately Christ departed from Jesus, and that Jesus suffered and rose again; 
whereas that Christ, being spiritual, remained beyond the possibility of 
suffering. 
CHAP. XXII.--DOCTRINE OF THE EBIONAEANS. 
The Ebionaeans, however, acknowledge that the world was made by Him Who is in 
reality God, but they propound legends concerning the Christ similarly with 
Cerinthus and Carpocrates. They live conformably to the customs of the Jews, 
alleging that they are justified. according to the law, and saying that Jesus 
was justified by fulfilling the law. And therefore it was, (according to the 
Ebionaeans,) that (the Saviour) was named (the) Christ of God and Jesus, since 
not one of the rest (of mankind) had observed completely the law. For if even 
any other had fulfilled the commandments (contained) in the law, he would have 
been that Christ. And the (Ebionaeans allege) that they themselves also, when in 
like manner they fulfil (the law), are able to become Christs; for they assert 
that our Lord Himself was a man in a like sense with all (the rest of the human 
family). 
CHAP. XXIII.--THE HERESY OF THEODOTUS. 
But there was a certain Theodotus, a native of Byzantium, who introduced a 
novel heresy. He announces tenets concerning the originating cause of the 
universe, which are partly in keeping with the doctrines of the true Church, in 
so far as he acknowledges that all things were created by God. Forcibly 
appropriating, however, (his notions of) Christ from the school of the Gnostics, 
and of Cerinthus and Ebion, he alleges that (our Lord) appeared in some such 
manner as I shall now describe. (According to this, Theodotus maintains) that 
Jesus was a (mere) man, born of a virgin, according to the counsel of the 
Father, and that after he had lived promiscuously with all men, and had be come 
pre-eminently religious, he subsequently at his baptism in Jordan received 
Christ, who came from above and descended (upon him) in form of a dove. And this 
was the reason, (according to Theodotus,) why (miraculous) powers did not 
operate within him prior to the manifestation in him of that Spirit which 
descended, (and) which proclaims him to be the Christ. But (among the followers 
of Theodotus) some are disposed (to think) that never was this man made God, 
(even) at the descent of the Spirit; whereas others (maintain that he was made 
God) after the resurrection from the dead. 
CHAP. XXIV.--THE MELCHISEDECIANS; THE NICOLAITANS. 
While, however, different questions have arisen among them, a certain 
(heretic), who himself also was styled Theodotus, and who was by trade a banker, 
attempted to establish (the doctrine), that a certain Melchisedec constitutes 
the greatest power, and that this one is greater than Christ. And they allege 
that Christ happens to be according to the likeness (of this Melchisedec). And 
they themselves, similarly with those who have been previously spoken of as 
adherents of Theodotus, assert that Jesus is a (mere) man, and that, in 
conformity with the same account (already given), Christ descended upon him. 
There are, however, among the Gnostics diversities of opinion; but we have 
decided that it would not be worth while to enumerate the silly doctrines of 
these (heretics), inasmuch as they are (too) numerous and devoid of reason, and 
full of blasphemy. Now, even those (of the heretics) who are of a more serious 
turn in regard of the Divinity, and have derived their systems of speculation 
from the Greeks, must stand convicted (of these charges). But Nicolaus has been 
a cause of the wide-spread combination of these wicked men. He, as one of the 
seven (that were chosen) for the diaconate, was appointed by the Apostles. (But 
Nicolaus) departed from correct doctrine, and was in the habit of inculcating 
indifferency of both life and food. And when the disciples (of Nicolaus) 
continued to offer insult to the Holy Spirit, John reproved them in the 
Apocalypse as fornicators and eaters of things offered unto idols. 
CHAP. XXV.--THE HERESY OF CERDON. 
But one Cerdon himself also, taking occasion in like manner from these 
(heretics) and Simon, affirms that the God preached by Moses and the prophets 
was not Father of Jesus Christ. For (he contends) that this (Father) had been 
known, whereas that the Father of Christ was unknown, and that the former was 
just, but the latter good. And Marcion corroborated the tenet of this (heretic) 
in the work which he attempted to write, and which he styled Antitheses. And he 
was in the habit, (in this book,) of uttering whatever slanders suggested 
themselves to his mind against the Creator of the universe. In a similar manner 
likewise (acted) Lucian, the disciple of this (heretic). 
CHAP. XXVI.--THE DOCTRINES OF APELLES; PHILUMENE, HIS PROPHETESS. 
But Apelles, sprung from these, thus expresses himself, (saying) that there 
is a certain good Deity, as also Marcion supposed, and that he who created all 
things is just. Now he, (according to Apelles,) was the Demiurge of generated 
entities. And (this heretic also main-rains) that there is a third (Deity), the 
one who was in the habit of speaking to Moses, and that this (god) was of a 
fiery nature, and that there was another fourth god, a cause of evils. But these 
he denominates angels. He utters, however, slanders against law and prophets, by 
alleging that the things that have been written are human (origin), and are 
false. And (Apelles) selects from the Gospels or (from the writings of) the 
Apostle (Paul) whatever pleases himself, But he devotes himself to the 
discourses of a certain Philumene as to the revelations of a prophetess. He 
affirms, however, that Christ descended from the power above; that is, from the 
good (Deity), and that he is the son of that good (Deity). And (he asserts that 
Jesus) was not born of a virgin, and that when he did appear he was not devoid 
of flesh. (He maintains,) however, that (Christ) formed his booty by taking 
portions of it from the substance of the universe: that is, hot and cold, and 
moist and dry. And (he says that Christ), on receiving in this body cosmical 
powers, lived for the time he did in (this) world. But (he held that Jesus) was 
subsequently crucified by the Jews, and expired, and that, being raised Up after 
three days, he appeared to his disciples. And (the Saviour) showed them, (so 
Apelles taught,) the prints of the nails and (the wound) in his side, desirous 
of persuading them that he was in truth no phantom, but was present in the 
flesh. After, says (Apelles), he had shown them his flesh, (the Saviour) 
restored it to earth, from which substance it was (derived. And this he did 
because) he coveted nothing that belonged to another. (Though indeed Jesus) 
might use for the time being (what belonged to another), he yet in due course 
rendered to each (of the elements) what peculiarly belonged to them. And so it 
was, that after he had once more loosed the chains of his body, he gave back 
heat to what is hot, cold to what is cold, moisture to what is moist, (and) 
dryness to what is dry. And in this condition (our Lord) departed to the good 
Father, leaving the seed of life in the world for those who through his 
disciples should believe in him. 
It appears to us that these (tenets) have been sufficiently explained. Since, 
however, we have determined to leave unrefuted not one of those opinions that 
have been advanced by any (of the heretics), let us see what (system) also has 
been invented by the Docetae.
