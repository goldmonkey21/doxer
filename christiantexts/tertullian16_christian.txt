TERTULLIAN 
ON THE RESURRECTION OF THE FLESH.
THE HERETICS AGAINST WHOM THIS WORK IS DIRECTED, WERE THE SAME WHO 
MAINTAINED THAT THE DEMIURGE, OR THE GOD WHO CREATED THIS WORLD AND GAVE THE 
MOSAIC DISPENSATION, WAS OPPOSED TO THE SUPREME GOD. HENCE THEY ATTACHED 
AN IDEA OF INHERENT CORRUPTION AND WORTHLESSNESS TO ALL HIS WORKS--AMONGST THE 
REST, TO THE FLESH OR BODY OF MAN; AFFIRMING THAT IT COULD NOT RISE AGAIN, AND 
THAT THE SOUL ALONE WAS CAPABLE OF INHERITING IMMORTALITY.

CHAP. I.--THE DOCTRINE OF THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY 
THE GOSPEL. THE FAINTEST' GLIMPSES OF SOMETHING LIKE IT OCCASIONALLY MET WITH IN 
HEATHENISM. INCONSISTENCIES OF PAGAN TEACHING.
The resurrection of the dead is the Christian's trust. By it we are 
believers. To the belief of this (article of the faith) truth compels us--that 
truth which God reveals, but the crowd derides, which supposes that nothing will 
survive after death. And yet they do honour to their dead, and that too in the 
most expensive way according to their bequest, and with the daintiest banquets 
which the seasons can produce, on the presumption that those whom they declare 
to be incapable of all perception still retain an appetite. But (let the crowd 
deride): I on my side must deride it still more, especially when it burns up its 
dead with harshest inhumanity, only to pamper them immediately afterwards with 
gluttonous satiety, using the selfsame fires to honour them and to insult them. 
What piety is that which mocks its victims with cruelty? Is it sacrifice or 
insult (which the crowd offers), when it burns its offerings to those it has 
already burnt? But the wise, too, join with the vulgar crowd in their opinion 
sometimes. There is nothing after death, according to the school of Epicurus. 
After death all things come to an end, even death itself, says Seneca to like 
effect. It is satisfactory, however, that the no less important philosophy of 
Pythagoras and Empedocles, and the Plantonists, take the contrary view, and 
declare the soul to be immortal; affirming, moreover, in a way which most nearly 
approaches (to our own doctrine)? that the soul actually returns into bodies, 
although not the same bodies, and not even those of human beings invariably: 
thus Euphorbus is supposed to have passed into Phythagoras, and Homer into a 
peacock. They firmly pronounced the soul's renewal to be in a body, (deeming it) 
more tolerable to change the quality (of the corporeal state)than to deny it 
wholly: they at least knocked at the door of truth, although they entered not. 
Thus the world, with all its errors, does not ignore the resurrection of the 
dead.

CHAP. II.--THE JEWISH SADDUCEES A LINK BETWEEN THE PAGAN
PHILOSOPHERS AND THE HERETICS ON THIS DOCTRINE. ITS FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE 
ASSERTED. THE SOUL FARES BETTER THAN THE BODY, IN HERETICAL ESTIMATION, AS TO 
ITS FUTURE STATE. ITS EXTINCTION, HOWEVER, WAS HELD BY ONE LUCAN.
Since there is even within the confines of God's Church a sect which is more 
nearly allied to the Epicureans than to the prophets, an opportunity is afforded 
us of knowing what estimate Christ forms of the (said sect, even the) Sadducees. 
For to Christ was it reserved to lay bare everything which before was concealed: 
to impart certainty to doubtful points; to accomplish those of which men had had 
but a foretaste; to give present reality to the objects of prophecy; and to 
furnish not only by Himself, but actually in Himself, certain proofs of the 
resurrection of the dead. It is, however, against other Sadducees that we have 
now to prepare ourselves, but still partakers of their doctrine. For instance, 
they allow a moiety of the resurrection; that is, simply of the soul, despising 
the flesh, just as they also do the Lord of the flesh Himself. No other persons, 
indeed, refuse to concede to the substance of the body its recovery from death, 
heretical inventors of a second deity. Driven then, as they are, to give a 
different dispensation to Christ, so that He may not be accounted as belonging 
to the Creator, they have achieved their first error in the article of His very 
flesh; contending with Marcion and Basilides that it possessed no reality; or 
else holding, after the heretical tenets of Valentinus, and according to 
Apelles, that it had qualities peculiar to itself. And so it follows that they 
shut out from all recovery from death that substance of which they say that 
Christ did not partake, confidently assuming that it furnishes the strongest 
presumption against the resurrection, since the flesh is already risen in 
Christ. Hence it is that we have ourselves previously issued our volume On the 
flesh of Christ; in which we both furnish proofs of its reality, in opposition 
to the idea of its being a vain phantom; and claim for it a human nature without 
any peculiarity of condition--such a nature as has marked out Christ to be both 
man and the Son of man. For when we prove Him to be invested with the flesh and 
in a bodily condition, we at the same time refute heresy, by establishing the 
rule that no other being than the Creator must be believed to be God, since we 
show that Christ, in whom God is plainly discerned, is precisely of such a 
nature as the Creator promised that He should be. Being thus refuted touching 
God as the Creator, and Christ as the Redeemer of the flesh, they will at once 
be defeated also on the resurrection of the flesh. No procedure, indeed, can be 
more reasonable. And we affirm that controversy with heretics should in most 
cases be conducted in this way. For due method requires that conclusions should 
always be drawn from the most important premises, in order that there be a prior 
agreement on the essential point, by means of which the particular question 
under review may be said to have been determined. Hence it is that the heretics, 
from their conscious weakness, never conduct discussion in an orderly manner. 
They are well aware how hard is their task in insinuating the existence of a 
second god, to the disparagement of the Creator of the world, who is known to 
all men naturally by the testimony of His works, who is before all others in the 
mysteriesof His being, and is especially manifested in the prophets; then, under 
the pretence of considering a more urgent inquiry, namely man's own salvation--a 
question which transcends all others in its importance--they begin with doubts 
about the resurrection; for there is greater difficulty in believing the 
resurrection of the flesh than the oneness of the Deity. In this way, after they 
have deprived the discussion of the advantages of its logical order, and have 
embarrassed it with doubtful insinuations in disparagement of the flesh, they 
gradually draw their argument to the reception of a second god after destroying 
and changing the very ground of our hopes. For when once a man Is fallen or 
removed from the sure hope which he had placed in the Creator, he is easily led 
away to the object of a different hope, whom however of his own accord he can 
hardly help suspecting. Now it is by a discrepancy in the promises that a 
difference of gods is insinuated. How many do we thus see drawn into the net 
vanquished on the resurrection of the flesh, before they could carry their point 
on the oneness of the Deity! In respect, then, of the heretics, we have shown 
with what weapons we ought to meet them. And indeed we have already encountered 
them in treatises severally directed against them: on the one only God and His 
Christ, in our work against Marcion, on the Lord's flesh, in our book against 
the four 547 
heresies, for the special purpose of opening the way to the present inquiry: 
so that we have now only to discuss the resurrection of the flesh, (treating it) 
just as if it were uncertain in regard to ourselves also, that is, in the system 
of the Creator. Because many persons are uneducated; still more are of faltering 
faith, and several are weak-minded: these will have to be instructed, directed, 
strengthened, inasmuch as the very oneness of the Godhead will be defended along 
with the maintenance of our doctrine. For if the resurrection of the flesh be 
denied, that prime article of the faith is shaken; if it be asserted, that is 
established. There is no need, I suppose, to treat of the soul's safety; for 
nearly all the heretics, in whatever way they conceive of it, certainly refrain 
from denying that. We may ignore a certain Lucan, who does not spare even this 
part of our nature, which he follows Aristotle in reducing to dissolution, and 
substitutes some other thing in lieu of it. Some third nature it is which, 
according to him, is to rise again, neither soul nor flesh; in other words, not 
man, but a bear perhaps--for instance, Lucan himself. Even he has received from 
us a copious notice in our book on the entire condition of the soul, the 
especial immortality of which we there maintain, whilst we also both acknowledge 
the dissolution of the flesh alone, and emphatically assert its restitution. 
Into the body of that work were collected whatever points we elsewhere had to 
reserve from the pressure of incidental causes. For as it is my custom to touch 
some questions but lightly on their first occurrence, so I 
am obliged also to postpone the consideration of them, until the outline can 
be filled in with complete detail, and the deferred points be taken up on their 
own merits. 
CHAP. III.--SOME TRUTHS HELD E. EN BY THE HEATHEN, THEY WERE, 
HOWEVER, MORE OFTEN WRONG BOTH IN RELIGIOUS OPINIONS AND IN MORAL PRACTICE. THE 
HEATHEN NOT TO BE FOLLOWED IN THEIR IGNORANCE OF THE CHRISTIAN MYSTERY. THE 
HERETICS PERVERSELY PRONE TO FOLLOW THEM.
One may no doubt be wise in the things of God, even from one's natural 
powers, but only in witness to the truth, not in maintenance of error; (only) 
when one acts in accordance with, not in opposition to, the divine dispensation. 
For some things are known even by nature: the immortality of the soul, for 
instance, is held by many; the knowledge of our God is possessed by all. I may 
use, therefore, the opinion of a Plato, when he declares, "Every soul is 
immortal." I may use also the conscience of a nation, when it attests the God of 
gods. I may, in like manner, use all the other intelligences of our common 
nature, when they pronounce God to be a judge. "God sees," (say they) (say 
they); and, "I commend you to God." But when they say, What has undergone death 
is dead," and, "Enjoy life whilst you live," and, "After death all things come 
to an end, even death itself;" then I must remember both that "the heart of man 
is ashes," according to the estimate of God, and that the very "Wisdom of the 
world is foolishness," (as the inspired word) pronounces it to be. Then, if even 
the heretic seek refuge in the depraved thoughts of the vulgar, or the 
imaginations of the world, I must say to him: Part company with the heathen, O 
heretic! for although you are all agreed in imagining a God, yet while you do so 
in the name of Christ, so long as you deem yourself a Christian, you are a 
different man from a heathen: give him back his own views of things, since he 
does not himself learn from yours. Why lean upon a blind guide, if you have eyes 
of your own? Why be clothed by one who is naked, if you have put on Christ? Why 
use the shield of another, when the apostle gives you armour of your own? It 
would be better for him to learn from you to acknowledge the resurrection of the 
flesh, than for you from him to deny it; because if Christians must needs deny 
it, it would be sufficient if they did so from their own knowledge, without any 
instruction from the ignorant multitude. He, therefore, will not be a Christian 
who shall deny this doctrine which is confessed by Christians; denying it, 
moreover, on grounds which are adopted by a man who is not a Christian. Take 
away, indeed, from the heretics the wisdom which they share with the heathen, 
and let them support their inquiries from the Scriptures alone: they will then 
be unable to keep their ground. For that which commends men's common sense is 
its very simplicity, and its participation in the same feelings, and its 
community of opinions; and it is deemed to be all the more trustworthy, inasmuch 
as its definitive statements are naked and open, and known to all. Divine 
reason, on the contrary, lies in the very pith and mar 548 
row of things, not on the surface, and very often is at variance with 
appearances. 
CHAP. IV.--HEATHENS AND HERETICS ALIKE IN THEIR VILIFICATION OF THE FLESH 
AND ITS FUNCTIONS, THE ORDINARY CAVILS AGAINST THE FINAL RESTITUTION OF 
SO WEAK AND IGNOBLE A SUBSTANCE.
Hence it is that heretics start at once from this point, from which they 
sketch the first draft of their dogmas, and afterwards add the details, being 
well aware how easily men's minds are caught by its influence, (and actuated) by 
that community of human sentiment which is so favourable to their designs. Is 
there anything else that you can hear of from the heretic, as also from the 
heathen, earlier in time or greater in extent? Is not (their burden) from the 
beginning and everywhere an invective against the flesh--against its origin, 
against its substance, against the casualties and the invariable end which await 
it; unclean from its first formation of the dregs of the ground, uncleaner 
afterwards from the mire of its own seminal transmission; worthless, weak, 
covered with guilt, laden with misery, full of trouble; and after all this 
record of its degradation, dropping into its original earth and the appellation 
of a corpse, and destined to dwindle away even from this loathsome name into 
none henceforth at all--into the very death of all designation? Now you are a 
shrewd man, no doubt: will you then persuade yourself, that after this flesh has 
been withdrawn from sight, and touch, and memory, it can never be rehabilitated 
from corruption to integrity, from a shattered to a solid State, from an empty 
to a full condition, from nothing at all to something--the devouring fires, and 
the waters of the sea, and the maws of beasts, and the crops of birds and the 
stomachs of fishes, and time's own great paunch itself of course yielding it all 
up again? Shall the same flesh which has fallen to decay be so expected to 
recover, as that the lame, and the one-eyed, and the blind, and the leper, and 
the palsied shall come back again, although there can be no pleasure in 
returning to their old condition? Or shall they be whole, and so have to fear 
exposure to such sufferings? What, in that case, (must we say) of the 
consequences of resuming the flesh? Will it again be subject to all its present 
wants, especially meats and drinks? Shall we have with our lungs to float (in 
air or water), and suffer pain in our bowels, and with organs of shame to feel 
no shame, and with all our limbs to toil and labour? Must there again be ulcers, 
and wounds, and fever, and gout, and once more the wishing to die? Of course 
these will be the longings incident on the recovery of the flesh, only the 
repetition of desires to escape out of it. Well now, we have (stated) all this 
in very subdued and delicate phrases, as suited to the character of our style; 
but (would you know) how great a licence of unseemly language these men actually 
use, you must test them in their conferences, whether they be heathens or 
heretics. 
CHAP. V.--SOME CONSIDERATIONS IN REPLY EULOGISTIC OF THE FLESH. IT WAS 
CREATED BY GOD. THE BODY OF MAN WAS, IN FACT, PREVIOUS TO HIS SOUL.
Inasmuch as all uneducated men, therefore, still form their opinions after 
these common-sense views, and as the falterers and the weak-minded have a 
renewal of their perplexities occasioned by the selfsame views; and as the first 
battering-ram which is directed against ourselves is that which shatters the 
condition of the flesh, we must on our side necessarily so manage our defences, 
as to guard, first of all, the condition of the flesh, their disparagement of it 
being repulsed by our own eulogy. The heretics, therefore, challenged us to use 
our rhetoric no less than our philosophy. Respecting, then, this frail and poor, 
worthless body, which they do not indeed hesitate to call evil, even if it had 
been the work of angels, as Menander and Marcus are pleased to think, or the 
formation of some fiery being, an angel, as Apelles teaches, it would be quite 
enough for securing respect for the body, that it had the support and protection 
of even a secondary deity. The angels, we know, rank next to God. Now, whatever 
be the supreme God of each heretic, I should not unfairly derive the dignity of 
the flesh likewise from Him to whom was present the will for its production. 
For, of course, if He had not willed its production, He would have prohibited 
it, when He knew it was in progress. It follows, then, that even on their 
principle the flesh is equally the work of God. There is no work but belongs to 
Him who has permitted it to exist. It is indeed a happy circumstance, that most 
of their doctrines, including even the harshest, accord to our God the entire 
formation of man. How mighty He is, you know full well who believe that He is 
the only God. Let, then, the flesh begin to give you pleasure, since the Creator 
thereof is so great. But, you say, even the world is the work of God, and yet 
"the fashion of this 549 
world passeth away," as the apostle himself testifies; nor must it be 
predetermined that the world will be restored, simply because it is the work of 
God. And surely if the universe, after its ruin, is not to be formed again, why 
should a portion of it be? You are right, if a portion is on an equality with 
the whole. But we maintain that there is a difference. In the first place, 
because all things were made by the Word of God, and without Him was nothing 
made. Now the flesh, too, had its existence from the Word of God, because of the 
principle, that here should be nothing without that Word. "Let us make man," 
said He, before He created him, and added, "with our hand," for the sake of his 
pre-eminence, that so he might not be compared with the rest of creation. And 
"God," says (the Scripture), "formed man." There is undoubtedly a great 
difference in the procedure, springing of course from the nature of the case. 
For the creatures which were made were inferior to him for whom they were made; 
and they were made for man, to whom they were afterwards made subject by God. 
Rightly, therefore, had the creatures which were thus intended for subjection, 
come forth into being at the bidding and command and sole power of the divine 
voice; whilst man, on the contrary, destined to be their lord, was formed by God 
Himself, to the intent that he might be able to exercise his mastery, being 
created by the Master the Lord Himself. Remember, too, that man is properly 
called flesh, which had a prior occupation in man's designation: "And God formed 
man the clay of the ground." He now became man, who was hitherto clay. "And He 
breathed upon his face the breath of life, and man (that is, the clay) became a 
living soul; and God placed the man whom He had formed in the garden." So that 
man was clay at first, and only afterwards man entire. I wish to impress this on 
your attention, with a view to your knowing, that whatever God has at all 
posposed or promised to man, is due not to the soul simply, but to the flesh 
also; if not arising out of any community in their origin, yet at all events by 
the privilege possessed by the latter in its name. 
CHAP. VI.--NOT THE LOWLINESS OF THE MATERIAL, BUT THE DIGNITY AND SKILL OF 
THE MAKER, MUST BE REMEMBERED, IN GAUGING THE EXCELLENCE OF TIlE FLESH. 
CHRIST PARTOOK OF OUR FLESH.
Let me therefore pursue the subject before me--if I can but succeed in 
vindicating for the flesh as much as was conferred on it by Him who made it, 
glorying as it even then was, because that poor paltry material, clay, found its 
way into the hands of God, whatever these were, happy enough at merely being 
touched by them. But why this glorying? Was it that, without any further labour, 
the clay had instantly assumed its form at the touch of God? The truth is, a 
great matter was in progress, out of which the creature under consideration was 
being fashioned. So often then does it receive honour, as often as it 
experiences the hands of God, when it is touched by them, and pulled, and drawn 
out, and moulded into shape. Imagine God wholly employed and absorbed in it--in 
His hand, His eye, His labour, His purpose, His wisdom, His providence, and 
above all, in His love, which was dictating the lineaments (of this creature). 
For, whatever was the form and expression which was then given to the clay (by 
the Creator) Christ was in His thoughts as one day to become man, because the 
Word, too, was to be both clay and flesh, even as the earth was then. For so did 
the Father previously say to the Son: "Let us make man in our own image, after 
our likeness." And God made man, that is to say, the creature which He moulded 
and fashioned; after the image of God (in other words, of Christ) did He make 
him And the Word was God also, who being in the image of God, "thought it not 
robbery to be equal to God." Thus, that clay which was even then putting on the 
image of Christ, who was to come in the flesh, was not only the work, but also 
the pledge and surety, of God. To what purpose is it to bandy about the name 
earth, as that of a sordid and grovelling element, with the view of tarnishing 
the origin of the flesh, when, even if any other material had been available for 
forming man, it would be requisite that the dignity of the Maker should be taken 
into consideration, who even by His selection of His material deemed it, and by 
His management made it, worthy? The hand of Phidias forms the Olympian Jupiter 
of ivory; worship is given to the statue, and it is no longer regarded as a god 
farmed out of a most silly animal, but as the world's supreme Deity- 550 
not because of the bulk of the elephant, but on account of the renown of 
Phidias. Could not therefore the living God, the true God, purge away by His own 
operation whatever vileness might have accrued to His material, and heal it of 
all infirmity? Or must this remain to shaw how much more nobly man could 
fabricate a god, than God could form a man? Now, although the clay is offensive 
(for its poorness), it is now something else. What I possess is flesh, not 
earth, even although of the flesh it is said: "Dust thou art, and unto dust 
shall thou return," In these words there is the mention of the origin, not a 
recalling of the substance. The privilege has been granted to the flesh to be 
nobler than its origin, and to have happiness aggrandized by the change wrought 
in it. Now, even gold is earth, because of the earth; but it remains earth no 
longer after it becomes gold, but is a far different substance, more splendid 
and more noble, though coming from a source which is comparatively faded and 
obscure. In like manner, it was quite allowable for God that He should dear the 
gold of our flesh from all the taints, as you deem them, of its native clay, by 
purging the original substance of its dross. 
CHAP. VII.--THE EARTHY MATERIAL OF WHICH FLESH IS CREATED WONDERFULLY 
IMPROVED BY GOD'S MANIPULATION. BY THE ADDITION OF THE SOUL IN MAN'S 
CONSTITUTION IT BECAME THE CHIEF WORK IN THE CREATION.
But perhaps the dignity of the flesh may seem to be diminished, because it 
has not been actually manipulated by the hand of God, as the clay was at first. 
Now, when God handled the clay for the express purpose of the growth of flesh 
out of it afterwards, it was for the flesh that He took all the trouble. But I 
want you, moreover, to know at what time and in what manner the flesh flourished 
into beauty out of its clay. For it cannot be, as some will have it, that those 
"coats of skins" which Adam and Eve put on when they were stripped of paradise, 
were really themselves the forming of the flesh out of clay, because long before 
that Adam had already recognised the flesh which was in the woman as the 
propagation of his own substance ("This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my 
flesh "4), and the very taking of the woman out of the man was supplemented with 
flesh; but it ought, I should suppose, to have been made good with clay, if Adam 
was still clay. The clay, therefore, was obliterated and absorbed into flesh. 
When did this happen? At the time that man became a living soul by the 
inbreathing of God--by the breath indeed which was capable of hardening clay 
into another substance, as into some earthenware, so now into flesh. In the same 
way the potter, too, has it in his power, by tempering the blast of his fire, to 
modify his clayey material into a stiffer one, and to mould one form after 
another more beautiful than the original substance, and now possessing both a 
kind and name of its own. For although the Scripture says, "Shall the clay say 
to the potter?" that is, Shall man contend with God? although the apostle speaks 
of "ear, then vessels " he refers to man, who was originally clay. And the 
vessel is the flesh, because this was made of clay by the breath of the divine 
afflatus; and it was afterwards clothed with "the coats of skins," that is, with 
the cutaneous covering which was placed over it. So truly is this the fact, that 
if you withdraw the skin, you lay bare the flesh. Thus, that which becomes a 
spoil when stripped off, was a vestment as long as it remained laid over. Hence 
the apostle, when he call circumcision "' a putting off (or spoliation) of the 
flesh," affirmed the skin to be a coat or tunic. Now this being the case, you 
have both the clay made glorious by the hand of God, and the flesh more glorious 
still by His breathing upon it, by virtue of which the flesh not only laid aside 
its clayey rudiments, but also took on itself the ornaments of the soul. You 
surely are not more careful than God, that you indeed should refuse to mount the 
gems of Scythia and India and the pearls of the Red Sea in lead, or brass, or 
iron, or even in silver, but should set them in the most precious and most 
highly-wrought gold; or, again, that you should provide for your finest wines 
and most costly unguents the most fitting vessels; or, on the same principle, 
should find for your swords of finished temper scabbards of equal worth; whilst 
God must consign to some vilest sheath the shadow of His own soul, the breath of 
His own Spirit, the operation of His own mouth, and by so ignominious a 
consignment secure, of course, its condemnation. Well, then, has He placed, or 
rather inserted and commingled, it with the flesh? Yes; and so intimate is the 
union, that it may be deemed to be uncertain whether the flesh bears about the 
soul, or the soul the flesh; or whether the flesh acts as apparitor to the soul, 
or the soul to the flesh. It is, However, more credible that the soul has 
service rendered to 551 
it, and has the mastery, as being more proximate in character to God. This 
circumstance even redounds to the glory of the flesh, inasmuch as it both 
contains an essence nearest to God's, and renders itself a partake of (the 
soul's) actual sovereignty. For what enjoyment of nature is there, what produce 
of the world, what relish of the elements, which is not imparted to the soul by 
means of the body? How can it be otherwise? Is it not by its means that the saul 
is supported by the entire apparatus of the senses--the sight, the hearing, the 
taste, the smell, the touch? Is it not by its means that it has a sprinkling of 
the divine power, there being nothing which it does not effect by its faculty of 
speech, even when it is only tacitly indicated? And speech is the result of a 
fleshly organ. The arts come through the flesh; through the flesh also effect is 
given to the mind's pursuits and powers; all work, too, and business and offices 
of life, are accomplished by the flesh; and so utterly, are the living acts of 
the soul the work of the flesh, that for the soul to cease to do living acts, 
would be nothing else than sundering itself from the flesh. So also the very act 
of dying is a function of the flesh, even as the process of life is. Now, if all 
things are subject to the soul through the flesh, their subjection is equally 
due to the flesh. That which is the means and agent of your enjoyment, must 
needs be also the partaker and sharer of your enjoyment. So that the flesh, 
which is accounted the minister and servant of the soul, turns out to be also 
its associate and co-heir. And if all this in temporal things, why not also in 
things eternal? 
CHAP. VIII.--CHRISTIANITY, BY ITS PROVISION FOR THE FLESH, HAS PUT ON IT 
THE
GREATEST HONOUR. THE PRIVILEGES OF OUR RELIGION IN CLOSEST CONNECTION WITH 
OUR
FLESH. WHICH ALSO BEARS A LARGE SHARE IN THE DUTIES AND SACRIFICES OF
RELIGION.
Now such remarks have I wished to advance in defence of the flesh, from a 
general view of the condition of our human nature. Let us now consider its 
special relation to Christianity, and see how vast a privilege before God has 
been conferred on this poor and worthless substance. It would suffice to say, 
indeed, that there is not a soul that can at all procure salvation, except it 
believe whilst it is in the flesh, so true is it that the flesh is the very 
condition on which salvation hinges. And since the soul is, in consequence of 
its salvation, chosen to the service of God, it is the flesh which actually 
renders it capable of such service. The flesh, indeed, is washed, in order that 
the soul may be cleansed; the flesh is anointed, that the soul may be 
consecrated; the flesh is signed (with the cross), that the soul too may be 
fortified; the flesh is shadowed with the imposition of hands, that the soul 
also maybe illuminated by the Spirit; the flesh feeds on the body and blood of 
Christ, that the soul likewise may fatten on its God. They cannot then be 
separated in their recompense, when they are united in their service. Those 
sacrifices, moreover, which are acceptable to God--I mean conflicts of the soul, 
fastings, and abstinences, and the humiliations which are annexed to such 
duty--it is the flesh which performs again and again to its own especial 
suffering. Virginity, likewise, and widowhood, and the modest restraint in 
secret on the marriage-bed, and the one only adoption of it, are fragrant 
offerings to God paid out of the good services of the flesh. 
Come, tell me what is your opinion of the flesh, when it has to contend for 
the name of Christ, dragged out to public view, and exposed to the hatred of all 
men; when it pines in prisons under the cruellest privation of light, in 
banishment from the world, amidst squalor, filth, and noisome food, without 
freedom even in sleep, for it is bound on its very pallet and mangled in its bed 
of straw; when at length before the public view it is racked by every kind of 
torture that can be devised, and when finally it is spent beneath its agonies, 
struggling to render its last turn for Christ by dying for Him--upon His own 
cross many times, not to say by still more atrocious devices of torment. Most 
blessed, truly, and most glorious, must be the flesh which can repay its Master 
Christ so vast a debt, and so completely, that the only obligation remaining due 
to Him is, that it should cease by death to owe Him more--all the more bound 
even then in gratitude, because (for ever) set free. 
CHAP. IX.--GOD'S LOVE FOR THE FLESH OF MAN, AS DEVELOPED IN THE GRACE 
OF
CHRIST TOWARDS IT. THE FLESH THE BEST MEANS OF DISPLAYING THE BOUNTY AND 
POWER
OF GOD.
To recapitulate, then: Shall that very flesh, which the Divine Creator formed 
with His own hands in the image of God; which He animated with His own afflatus, 
after the likeness of His own vital vigour; which He set over all the works of 
His hand, to dwell amongst, to enjoy, and to rule them; which He clothed with 
His sacraments and His instructions; whose purity He loves, whose mor 552 
tifications He approves; whose sufferings for Himself He deems precious;-- 
(shall that flesh, I say), so often brought near to God, not rise again? God 
forbid, God forbid, (I repeat), that He should abandon to everlasting 
destruction the labour of His own hands, the care of His own thoughts, the 
receptacle of His own Spirit, the queen of His creation, the inheritor of His 
own liberality, the priestess of His religion, the champion of His testimony, 
the sister of His Christ! We know by experience the goodness of God; from His 
Christ we learn that He is the only God, and the very good. Now, as He requires 
from us love to our neighbour after love to Himself, so He will Himself do that 
which He has commanded. He will love the flesh which is, so very closely and in 
so many ways, His neighbour- (He will love it), although infirm, since His 
strength is made perfect in weakness; although disordered, since "they that are 
whole need not the physician, but they that are sick;" although not honourable, 
since "we bestow more abundant honour upon the less honourable members;" 
although ruined, since He says, "I am come to save that which was lost;" 
although sinful, since He says, "I desire rather the salvation of the sinner 
than his death;" although condemned, for says He, "I shall wound, and also heal. 
" Why reproach the flesh with those conditions which wait for God, which hope in 
God, which receive honour from God, which He succours? I venture to declare, 
that if such casualties as these had never befallen the flesh, the bounty, the 
grace, the mercy, (and indeed) all the beneficent power of God, would have had 
no opportunity to work. 
CHAP. X.--HOLY SCRIPTURE MAGNIFIES THE FLESH, AS TO ITS NATURE AND ITS 
PROSPECTS.
You hold to the scriptures in which the flesh is disparaged; receive also 
those in which it is ennobled. You read whatever passage abases it; direct your 
eyes also to that which elevates it. "All flesh is grass." Well, but Isaiah was 
not content to say only this; but he also declared, "All flesh shall see the 
salvation of God. " They notice God when He says in Genesis, "My Spirit shall 
not remain among these men, because they are flesh; " but then He is also heard 
saying by Joel, "I will pour I out of my Spirit upon all flesh." Even the 
apostle ought not to be known for any one statement in which he is wont to 
reproach the flesh. For although he says that "in his flesh dwelleth no good 
thing;" although he affirms that "they who are in the flesh cannot please 
God,"15 because "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit;" yet in these and similar 
assertions which he makes, it is not the substance of the flesh, but its 
actions, which are censured. Moreover, we shall elsewhere take occasion to 
remark, that no reproaches can fairly be cast upon the flesh, without tending 
also to the castigation of the soul, which compels the flesh to do its bidding. 
However, let me meanwhile add that in the same passage Paul "carries about in 
his body the marks of the Lord Jesus;" he also forbids our body to be profaned, 
as being "the temple of God;" he makes our bodies "the members of Christ;" and 
he exhorts us to exalt and "glorify God in our body." If, therefore, the 
humiliations of the flesh thrust off its resurrection, why shall not its high 
prerogatives rather avail to bring it about?--since it better suits the 
character of God to restore to salvation what for a while He rejected, than to 
surrender to perdition what He once approved. 
CHAP. XI.--THE POWER OF GOD FULLY COMPETENT TO EFFECT THE
RESURRECTION OF THE FLESH.
Thus far touching my eulogy of the flesh, in opposition to its enemies, who 
are, notwithstanding, its greatest friends also; for there is nobody who lives 
so much in accordance with the flesh as they who deny the resurrection of the 
flesh, inasmuch as they despise all its discipline, while they disbelieve its 
punishment. It is a shrewd saying which the Paraclete utters concerning these 
persons by the mouth of the prophetess Prisca: "They are carnal, and yet they 
hate the flesh." Since, then, the flesh has the best guarantee that could 
possibly accrue for securing to it the recompense of salvation, ought we not 
also to consider well the power, and might, and competency of God Himself, 
whether He be so great as to be able to rebuild and restore the edifice of the 
flesh, which had become dilapidated and 553 
blocked up, and in every possible way dislocated?--whether He has promulgated 
in the public domains of nature any analogies to convince us of His power in 
this respect, lest any should happen to be still thirsting for the knowledge of 
God, when faith in Him must rest on no other basis than the belief that He is 
able to do all things? You have, no doubt amongst your philosophers men who 
maintain that this world is without a beginning or a maker. It is, however, much 
more true, that nearly all the heresies allow it an origin and a maker, and 
ascribe its creation to our God. Firmly believe, therefore, that He produced it 
wholly out of nothing, and then you have found the knowledge of God, by 
believing that He possesses such mighty power. But some persons are too weak to 
believe all this at first, owing to their views about Matter. They will rather 
have it, after the philosophers, that the universe was in the beginning made by 
God out of underlying matter. Now, even if this opinion could be held in truth, 
since He must be acknowledged to have produced in His reformation of matter far 
different substances and far different forms from those which Matter itself 
possessed, I should maintain, with no less persistence, that He produced these 
things out of nothing, since they absolutely had no existence at all previous to 
His production of them. 
Now, where is the difference between a thing's being produced out of nothing 
or out of something, if so be that what existed not comes into being, when even 
to have had no existence is tantamount to having been nothing? The contrary is 
likewise true; for having once existed amounts to having been something. If, 
however, there is a difference, both alternatives support my position. For if 
God produced all things whatever out of nothing, He will be able to draw forth 
from nothing even the flesh which had fallen into nothing; or if He moulded 
other things out of matter, He will be able to call forth the flesh too from 
somewhere else, into whatever abyss it may have been engulphed. 
And surely He is most competent to re-create who created, inasmuch as it is a 
far greater work to have produced than to have reproduced, to have imparted a 
beginning, than to have maintained a continuance. On this principle, you may be 
quite sure that the restoration of the flesh is easier than its first formation. 

CHAP. XII.--SOME ANALOGIES IN NATURE WHICH CORROBORATE THE
RESURRECTION OF THE FLESH.
Consider now those very analogies of the divine power (to which we have just 
alluded). Day dies into night, and is buried everywhere in darkness. The glory 
of the world is obscured in the shadow of death; its entire substance is 
tarnished with blackness; all things become sordid, silent, stupid; everywhere 
business ceases, and occupations rest. And so over the loss of the light there 
is mourning. But yet it again revives, with its own beauty, its own dowry, is 
own sun, the same as ever, whole and entire, over all the world, slaying its own 
death, night--opening its own sepulchre, the darkness--coming forth the heir to 
itself, until the night also revives--it, too, accompanied with a retinue of its 
own. For the stellar rays are rekindled, which had been quenched in the morning 
glow; the distant groups of the constellations are again brought back to view, 
which the day's temporary interval had removed out of sight. Readorned also are 
the mirrors of the moon, which her monthly course had worn away. Winters and 
summers return, as do the spring-tide and autumn, with their resources, their 
routines, their fruits. Forasmuch as earth receives its instruction from heaven 
to clothe the trees which had been stripped, to colour the flowers afresh, to 
spread the grass again, to reproduce the seed which had been consumed, and not 
to reproduce them until consumed. Wondrous method! from a defrauder to be a 
preserver, in order to restore, it takes away; in order to guard, it destroys; 
that it may make whole, it injures; and that it may enlarge, it first lessens. 
(This process) indeed, renders back to us richer and fuller blessings than it 
deprived us of--by a destruction which is profit, by an injury which is 
advantage, and by a loss which is gain. In a word, I would say, all creation is 
instinct with renewal. Whatever you may chance upon, has already existed; 
whatever you have lost, returns again without fail. All things return to their 
former state, after having gone out of sight; all things begin after they have 
ended; they come to an end for the very purpose of coming into existence again. 
Nothing perishes but with a view to salvation. The whole, therefore, of this 
revolving order of things bears witness to the resurrection of the dead. In His 
works did God write it, before He wrote it in the Scriptures; He proclaimed it 
in His mighty deeds earlier than in His inspired words. He first sent Nature to 
you as a teacher, meaning to send Prophecy also as a supplemental instructor, 
that, being Nature's disciple, you may more easily believe Prophecy, and without 
hesitation accept (its testimony) when you come to hear what you have seen 
already on every side; nor doubt that 554 
God, whom you have discovered to be the restorer of all things, is likewise 
the reviver of the flesh. And surely, as all things rise again for man, for 
whose use they have been provided-but not for man except for his flesh also--how 
happens it that (the flesh) itself can perish utterly, because of which and for 
the service of which nothing comes to nought? 
CHAP. XIII.--FROM OUR AUTHOR'S VIEW OF A VERSE IN THE NINETY-SECOND PSALM, 
THE PHOENIX IS MADE A SYMBOL OF THE RESURRECTION OF OUR BODIES.
If, however, all nature but faintly figures our resurrection; if creation 
affords no sign precisely like it, inasmuch as its several phenomena can hardly 
be said to die so much as to come to an end, nor again be deemed to be 
reanimated, but only re-formed; then take a most complete and unassailable, 
symbol of our hope, for it shall be an animated being, and subject alike to life 
and death. I refer to the bird which is peculiar to the East, famous for its 
singularity, marvelous from its posthumous life, which renews its life in a 
voluntary death; its dying day is its birthday, for on it it departs and 
returns; once more a phoenix where just now there was none; once more himself, 
but just now out of existence; another, yet the same. What can be more express 
and more significant for our subject; or to what other thing can such a 
phenomenon bear witness? God even in His own Scripture says: "The righteous 
shall flourish like the phoenix;" that is, shall flourish or revive, from death, 
from the grave--to teach you to believe that a bodily substance may be recovered 
even from the fire. Our Lord has declared that we are "better than many 
sparrows:" well, if not better than many a phoenix too, it were no great thing. 
But must men die once for all, while birds in Arabia are sure of a resurrection? 

CHAP. XIV.--A SUFFICIENT CAUSE FOR THE RESURRECTION OF THE FLESH OCCURS IN 
THE FUTURE JUDGMENT OF MAN, IT WILL TAKE COGNISANCE OF THE WORKS OF THE BODY NO 
LESS THAN OF THE SOUL.
Such, then, being the outlines of the divine energies which God has displayed 
as much in the parables of nature as in His spoken word, let us now approach His 
very edicts and decrees, since this is the division which we mainly adopt in our 
subject-matter. We began with the dignity of the flesh, whether it were of such 
a nature that when once destroyed it was capable of being restored. Then we 
pursued an inquiry touching the power of God, whether it was sufficiently great 
to be habitually able to confer this restoration on a thing which had been 
destroyed. Now, if we have proved these two points, I 
should like you to inquire into the (question of) cause, whether it be one of 
sufficient weight to claim the resurrection of the flesh as necessary and as 
conformable in every way to reason; because there underlies this demurrer: the 
flesh may be quite capable of being restored, and the Deity be perfectly able to 
effect the restoration, but a cause for such recovery must needs pre-exist. 
Admit then a sufficient one, you who learn of a God who is both supremely 
good as well as just__ supremely good from His own (character), just in 
consequence of ours. For if man had never sinned, he would simply and solely 
have known God in His superlative goodness, from the attribute of His nature. 
But now he experiences Him to be a just God also, from the necessity of a 
cause; still, however, retaining under this very circumstance His excellent 
goodness, at the same time that He is also just. For, by both succouring the 
good and punishing the evil, He displays His justice, and at the same time makes 
both processes contribute proofs of His goodness, whilst on the one hand He 
deals vengeance, land on the other dispenses reward. But with Marcion 
you will have the opportunity of more fully learning whether this be the 
whole character of God. Meanwhile, so perfect is our (God), that He is rightly 
Judge, because He is the Lord; rightly the Lord, because the Creator; rightly 
the Creator, because He is God. Whence it happens that that heretic, whose name 
I know not, holds that He properly is not a Judge, since He is not Lord; 
properly not Lord, since He is not the Creator. And so I am at a loss to know 
how He is God, who is neither the Creator, which God is; nor the Lord, which the 
Creator is. Inasmuch, then, as it is most suitable for the great Being who is 
God, and Lord, and Creator to summon man to a judgment on this very question, 
whether he has taken care or not to acknowledge and honour his Lord and Creator, 
this is just such a judgment as the resurrection shall achieve. 
The entire cause, then, or rather necessity of the resurrection, will be 
this, namely, that arrangement of the final judgment which shall be most 
suitable to God. Now, in effecting this arrangement, you must consider whether 
the divine censure superintends a judicial ex 555 
amination of the two natures of man--both his soul and his flesh. For that 
which is a suitable object to be judged, is also a competent one to be raised. 
Our position is, that the judgment of God must be believed first of all to be 
plenary, and then absolute, so as to be final, and therefore irrevocable; to be 
also righteous, not bearing less heavily on any particular part; to be moreover 
worthy of God, being complete and definite, in keeping with His great patience. 
Thus it follows that the fulness and perfection of the judgment consists simply 
in representing the interests of the entire human being. Now, since the entire 
man consists of the union of the two natures, he must therefore appear in both, 
as it is right that he should be judged in his entirety; nor, of course, did he 
pass through life except in his entire state. As therefore he lived, so also 
must he be judged, because he has to be judged concerning the way in which he 
lived. For life is the cause of judgment, and it must undergo investigation in 
as many natures as it possessed when it discharged its vital functions. 
CHAP. XV.--AS THE FLESH IS A PARTAKER WITH THE SOUL IN ALL HUMAN CONDUCT, 
SO WILL IT BE IN THE RECOMPENSE OF ETERNITY.
Come now, let our opponents sever the connection of the flesh with the soul 
in the affairs of life, that they may be emboldened to sunder it also in the 
recompense of life. Let them deny their association in acts, that they may be 
fairly able to deny also their participation in rewards. The flesh ought not to 
have any share in the sentence, if it had none in the cause of it. Let the soul 
alone be called back, if it alone went away. But (nothing of the kind ever 
happened); for the soul alone no more departed from life, than it ran through 
alone the course from which it departed--I mean this present life. Indeed, the 
soul alone is so far from conducting (the affairs of) life, that we do not 
withdraw from community with the flesh even our thoughts, however isolated they 
be, however unprecipitated into act by means of the flesh; since whatever is 
done in man's heart is done by the soul in the flesh, and with the flesh, and 
through the flesh. The Lord Himself, in short, when rebuking our thoughts, 
includes in His censures this aspect of the flesh, (man's heart), the citadel of 
the soul: "Why think ye evil in your hearts?" and again: "Whosoever looketh on a 
woman, to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his 
heart." So that even the thought, without operation and without effect, is an 
act of the flesh. But if you allow that the faculty which rules the senses, and 
which they call Hegemonikon, has its sanctuary in the brain, or in the interval 
between the eyebrows, or wheresoever the philosophers are pleased to locate it, 
the flesh will still be the thinking place of the soul. The soul is never 
without the flesh, as long as it is in the flesh. There is nothing which the 
flesh does not transact in company with the soul, when without it does not 
exist. Consider carefully, too, whether the thoughts are not administered by the 
flesh, since it is through the flesh that they are distinguished and known 
externally. Let the soul only meditate some design, the face gives the 
indication--the face being the mirror of all our intentions. They may deny all 
combination in acts, but they cannot gainsay their co-operation in thoughts. 
Still they enumerate the sins of the flesh; surely, then, for its sinful conduct 
it must be consigned to punishment. But we, moreover, allege against them the 
virtues of the flesh; surely also for its virtuous conduct it deserves a future 
reward. Again, as it is the soul which acts and impels us in all we do, so it is 
the function of the flesh to render obedience. Now we are not permitted to 
suppose that God is either unjust or idle. Unjust, (however He would be,) were 
He to exclude from reward the flesh which is associated in good works; and idle, 
were He to exempt it from punishment, when it has been an accomplice in evil 
deeds: whereas human judgment is deemed to be the more perfect, when it 
discovers the agents in every deed, and neither spares the guilty nor grudges 
the virtuous their full share of either punishment or praise with the principals 
who employed their services. 
CHAP. XVI.--THE HERETICS CALLED THE FLESH "THE VESSEL OF THE SOUL," IN 
ORDER TO DESTROY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BODY. THEIR CAVIL TURNS UPON 
THEMSELVES AND SHOWS THE FLESH TO BE A SHARER IN HUMAN. ACTIONS.
When, however, we attribute to the soul authority, and to the flesh 
submission, we must see to it that (our opponents) do not turn our position by 
another argument, by insisting on so placing the flesh in the service of the 
soul, that it be not (considered as) its servant, lest they should be compelled, 
if it were so regarded, to admit its companionship (to the soul). For they would 
argue that servants and companions possess a discretion in discharging the 
functions of their respective 556 
office, and a power over their will in both relations: in short, (they would 
claim to be) men themselves, and therefore (would expect) to share the credit 
with their principals, to whom they voluntarily yielded their assistance; 
whereas the flesh had no discretion, no sentiment in itself, but possessing no 
power of its own of willing or refusing, it, in fact, appears to stand to the 
soul in the stead of a vessel as an instrument rather than a servant. The soul 
alone, therefore, will have to be judged (at the last day) pre-eminently as to 
how it has employed the vessel of the flesh; the vessel itself, of course, not 
being amenable to a judicial award: for who condemns the cup if any. man has 
mixed poison in it? or who sentences the sword to the beasts, if a man has 
perpetrated with it the atrocities of a brigand? Well, now, we will grant that 
the flesh is innocent, in so far as bad actions will not be charged upon it: 
what, then, is there to hinder its being saved on the score of its innocence? 
For although it is free from all imputation of good works, as it is of evil 
ones, yet it is more consistent with the divine goodness to deliver the 
innocent. A beneficent man, indeed, is bound to do so: it suits then the 
character of the Most Bountiful to bestow even gratuitously such a favour. And 
yet, as to the cup, I will not take the poisoned one, into which some certain 
death is injected, but one which has been infected with the breath of a 
lascivious woman, or of Cybele's priest, or of a gladiator, or of a hangman: 
then I want to know whether you would pass a milder condemnation on it than on 
the kisses of such persons? One indeed which is soiled with our own filth, or 
one which is not mingled to our own mind we are apt to dash to pieces, and then 
to increase our anger with our servant. As for the sword, which is drunk with 
the blood of the brigand's victims, who would not banish it entirely from his 
house, much more from his bed-room, or from his pillow, from the presumption 
that he would be sure to dream of nothing but the apparitions of the souls which 
were pursuing and disquieting him for lying down with the blade which shed their 
own blood? Take, however, the cup which has no reproach on it, and which 
deserves the credit of a faithful ministration, it will be adorned by its 
drinking-master with chaplets, or be honoured with a handful of flowers. The 
sword also which has received honourable stains in war, and has been thus 
engaged in a better manslaughter, will secure its own praise by consecration. It 
is quite possible, then, to pass decisive sentences even on vessels and on 
instruments, that so they too may participate in the merits of their proprietors 
and employers. Thus much do I say from a desire to meet even this argument, 
although there is a failure in the example, owing to the diversity in the nature 
of the objects. For every vessel or every instrument becomes useful from 
without, consisting as it does of material perfectly extraneous to the substance 
of the human owner or employer; whereas the flesh, being conceived, formed, and 
generated along with the soul from its earliest existence in the womb, is mixed 
up with it likewise in all its operations. For although it is called "a vessel" 
by the apostle, such as he enjoins to be treated "with honour," it is yet 
designated by the same apostle as "the outward man,"--that clay, of course, 
which at the first was inscribed with the title of a man, not of a cup or a 
sword, or any paltry vessel. Now it is called a "vessel" in consideration of its 
capacity, whereby it receives and contains the soul; but "man," from its 
community of nature, which renders it in all operations a servant and not an 
instrument. Accordingly, in the judgment it will be held to be a servant (even 
though it may have no independent discretion of its own), on the ground of its 
being an integral portion of that which possesses such discretion, and is not a 
mere chattel. And although the apostle is well aware that the flesh does nothing 
of itself which is not also imputed to the soul, he yet deems the flesh to be 
"sinful;" lest it should be supposed to be free from all responsibility by the 
mere fact of its seeming to be impelled by the soul. So, again, when he is 
ascribing certain praiseworthy actions to the flesh, he says, "Therefore glorify 
and exalt God in your body,"--being certain that such efforts are actuated by 
the soul; but still he ascribes them to the flesh, because it is to it that he 
also promises the recompense. Besides, neither rebuke, (on the one hand), would 
have been suitable to it, if free from blame; nor, (on the other hand), would 
exhortation, if it were incapable of glory. Indeed, both rebuke and exhortation 
would be alike idle towards the flesh, if it were an improper object for that 
recompence which is certainly received in the resurrection. 
CHAP. XVII.--THE FLESH WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOUL IN ENDURING 
THE PENAL SENTENCES OF THE FINAL JUDGMENT.
"Every uneducated person who agrees with our opinion will be apt to suppose 
that 557 
the flesh will have to be present at the final judgment even on this account, 
because otherwise the soul would be incapable of suffering pain or pleasure, as 
being incorporeal; for this is the common opinion. We on our part, however, do 
here maintain, and in a special treatise on the subject prove, that the soul is 
corporeal, possessing a peculiar kind of solidity in its nature, such as enables 
it both to perceive and suffer. That souls are even now susceptible of torment 
and of blessing in Hades, though they are disembodied, and notwithstanding their 
banishment from the flesh, is proved by the case of Lazarus. I have no doubt 
given to my opponent room to say: Since, then, the soul has a bodily substance 
of its own, it will be sufficiently endowed with the faculty of suffering and 
sense, so as not to require the presence of the flesh. No, no, (is my reply): it 
will still need the flesh; not as being unable to feel anything without the help 
of the flesh, but because it is necessary that it should possess such a faculty 
along with the flesh. For in as far as it has a sufficiency of its own for 
action, in so far has it likewise a capacity for suffering. But the truth is, in 
respect of action, it labours under some amount of incapacity; for in its own 
nature it has simply the ability to think, to will, to desire, to dispose: for 
fully, carrying out the purpose, it looks for the assistance of the flesh. In 
like manner, it also requires the conjunction of the flesh to endure suffering, 
in order that by its aid it may be as fully able to suffer, as without its 
assistance it was not fully able to act. In respect, indeed, of those sins, such 
as concupiscence, and thought, and wish, which it has a competency of its own to 
commit, it at once pays the penalty of them. Now, no doubt, if these were alone 
sufficient to constitute absolute desert without requiring the addition of acts, 
the soul would suffice in itself to encounter the full responsibility of the 
judgment, being to be judged for those things in the doing of which it alone had 
possessed a sufficiency. Since, however, acts too are indissolubly attached to 
deserts; since also acts are ministerially effected by the flesh, it is no 
longer enough that the soul apart from the flesh be requited with pleasure or 
pain for what are actually works of the flesh, although it has a body (of its 
own), although it has members (of its own), which in like manner are 
insufficient for its full perception, just as they are also for its perfect 
action. Therefore as it has acted in each several instance, so proportionably 
does it suffer in Hades, being the first to taste of judgment as it was the 
first to induce to the commission of sin; but still it is waiting for the flesh 
in order that it may through the flesh also compensate for its deeds, inasmuch 
as it laid upon the flesh the execution of its own thoughts. This, in short, 
will be the process of that judgment which is postponed to the last great day, 
in order that by the exhibition of the flesh the entire course of the divine 
vengeance may be accomplished. Besides, (it is obvious to remark) there would be 
no delaying to the end of that doom which souls are already tasting in Hades, if 
it was destined for souls alone. 
CHAP. XVIII.--SCRIPTURE PHRASES AND PASSAGES CLEARLY ASSERT "THE 
RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD." THE FORCE OF THIS VERY PHRASE EXPLAINED AS INDICATING 
THE PROMINENT PLACE OF THE FLESH IN THE GENERAL RESURRECTION.
Thus far it has been my object by prefatory remarks to lay a foundation for 
the defence of all the Scriptures which promise a resurrection of the flesh. 
Now, inasmuch as this verity is supported by so many just and reasonable 
considerations--I mean the dignity of the flesh itself, the power and might of 
God, the analogous cases in which these are displayed, as well as the good 
reasons for the judgment, and the need thereof--it will of course be only right 
and proper that the Scriptures should be understood in the sense suggested by 
such authoritative considerations, and not after the conceits of the heretics, 
which arise from infidelity solely, because it is deemed incredible that the 
flesh should be recovered from death and restored to life; not because (such a 
restoration) is either unattainable by the flesh itself, or impossible for God 
to effect, or unsuitable to the final judgment. Incredible, no doubt, it might 
be, if it had not been revealed in the word of God; except that, even if it had 
not been thus first announced by God, it might have been fairly enough assumed, 
that the revelation of it had been withheld, simply because so many strong 
presumptions in its favour had been already furnished. Since, however, (the 
great fact) is proclaimed in so many inspired passages, that is so far a 
dissuasive against understanding it in a sense different from that which is 
attested by such arguments as persuade us to its reception, even irrespective of 
the testimonies of revelation. Let us see, then, first of all in what title this 
hope of ours is held out to our view. 
558 
There is, I imagine, one divine edict which is exposed to the gaze of all 
men: it is "The Resurrection of the Dead." These words are prompt, decisive, 
clear. I mean to take these very terms, discuss them, and discover to what 
substance they apply. As to the word resurrectio, whenever I hear of its 
impending over a human being, I am forced to inquire what part of him has been 
destined to fall, since nothing can be expected to rise again, unless it has 
first been prostrated. It is only the man who is ignorant of the fact that the 
flesh falls by death, that can fail to discover that it stands erect by means of 
life. Nature pronounces God's sentence: "Dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou 
return." Even the man who has not heard the sentence, sees the fact. No death 
but is the ruin of our limbs. This destiny of the body the Lord also described, 
when, clothed as He was in its very substance, He said, "Destroy this temple, 
and in three days I will raise it up again." For He showed to what belongs (the 
incidents of) being destroyed, thrown down, and kept down--even to that to which 
it also appertains to be lifted and raised up again; although He was at the same 
time bearing about with Him "a soul that was trembling even unto death," but 
which did not fall through death, because even the Scripture informs us that "He 
spoke of His body." So that it is the flesh which falls by death; and 
accordingly it derives its name, cadaver, from cadendo. The soul, however, has 
no trace of a fall in its designation, as indeed there is no mortality in its 
condition. Nay it is the soul which communicates its ruin to the body when it is 
breathed out of it, just as it is also destined to raise it up again from the 
earth when it shall re-enter it. That cannot fall which by its entrance raises; 
nor can that droop which by its departure causes ruin. I will go further, and 
say that the soul does not even fall into sleep along with the body, nor does it 
with its companion even lie down in repose. For it is agitated in dreams, and 
disturbed: it might, however, rest, if it lay down; and lie down it certainly 
would, if it fell. Thus that which does not fall even into the likeness of 
death, does not succumb to the reality thereof. Passing now to the other word 
mortuorum, I wish you to look carefully, and see to what substance it is 
applicable. Were we to allow, under this head, as is sometimes held by the 
heretics, that the soul is mortal, so that being mortal it shall attain to a 
resurrection; this would afford a presumption that the flesh also, being no less 
mortal, would share in the same resurrection. But our present point is to derive 
from the proper signification of this word an idea of the destiny which it 
indicates. Now, just as the term resurrection is predicated of that which 
falls--that is, the flesh--so will there be the same application of the word 
dead, because what is called "the resurrection of the dead" indicates the rising 
up again of that which is fallen down. We learn this from the case of Abraham, 
the father of the faithful, a man who enjoyed close intercourse with God. For 
when he requested of the sons of Heth a spot to bury Sarah in, he said to them, 
"Give me the possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my 
dead,"--meaning, of course, her flesh; for he could not have desired a place to 
bury her soul in, even if the soul is to be deemed mortal, and even if it could 
bear to be described by the word "dead." Since, then, this word indicates the 
body, it follows that when "the resurrection of the dead" is spoken of, it is 
the rising again of men's bodies that is meant. 
CHAP. XIX.--THE SOPHISTICAL SENSE PUT BY HERETICS ON THE PHRASE 
"RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD," AS IF IT MEANT THE MORAL CHANGE OF A NEW LIFE.
Now this consideration of the phrase in question, and its 
signification--besides maintaining, of course, the true meaning of the important 
words--must needs contribute to this further result, that whatever obscurity our 
adversaries throw over the subject under the pretence of figurative and 
allegorical language, the truth will stand out in clearer light, and out of 
uncertainties certain and definite rules will be prescribed. 
For some, when they have alighted on a very usual form of prophetic 
statement, generally expressed in figure and allegory, though not always, 
distort into some imaginary sense even the most clearly described doctrine of 
the resurrection of the dead, alleging that even death itself must be understood 
in a spiritual sense. They say that which is commonly supposed to be death is 
not really so,--namely, the separation of body and soul: it is rather the 
ignorance of God, by reason of which man is dead to God, and is not less buried 
in error than he would be in the grave. Wherefore that also must be held to be 
the resurrection, when a man is reanimated by access to the truth, and having 
dispersed the death of ignorance, and being endowed with new life 559 
by God, has burst forth from the sepulchre of the old man, even as the Lord 
likened the scribes and Pharisees to "whited sepulchres." Whence it follows that 
they who have by faith attained to the resurrection, are with the Lord after 
they have once put Him on in their baptism. By such subtlety, then, even in 
conversation have they often been in the habit of misleading our brethren, as if 
they held a resurrection of the dead as well as we. Woe, say they, to him who 
has not risen in the present body; for they fear that they might alarm their 
hearers if they at once denied the resurrection. Secretly, however, in their 
minds they think this: Woe betide the simpleton who during his present life 
fails to discover the mysteries of heresy; since this, in their view, is the 
resurrection. There are however, a great many also, who, claiming to hold a 
resurrection after the soul's departure, maintain that going out of the 
sepulchre means escaping out of the world, since in their view the world is the 
habitation of the dead--that is, of those who know not God; or they will go so 
far as to say that it actually means escaping out of the body itself, since they 
imagine that the body detains the soul, when it is shut up in the death of a 
worldly life, as in a grave. 
CHAP. XX.--FIGURATIVE SENSES HAVE THEIR FOUNDATION IN LITERAL FACT. 
BESIDES, THE ALLEGORICAL STYLE IS BY NO MEANS THE ONLY ONE FOUND IN THE 
PROPHETIC
SCRIPTURES, AS ALLEGED BY THE HERETICS.
Now, to upset all conceits of this sort, let me dispel at once the 
preliminary idea on which they rest--their assertion that the prophets make all 
their announcements in figures of speech. Now, if this were the case, the 
figures themselves could not possibly have been distinguished, inasmuch as the 
verities would not have been declared, out of which the figurative language is 
stretched. And, indeed, if all are figures, where will be that of which they are 
the figures? How can you hold up a mirror for your face, if the face nowhere 
exists? But, in truth, all are not figures, but there are also literal 
statements; nor are all shadows, but there are bodies too: so that we have 
prophecies about the Lord Himself even, which are clearer than the day For it 
was not figuratively that the Virgin conceived in her womb; nor in a trope did 
she bear Emmanuel, that is, Jesus, God with us. Even granting that He was 
figuratively to take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria, still it 
was literally that He was to "enter into judgment with the elders and princes of 
the people." For in the person of Pilate "the heathen raged," and in the person 
of Israel "the people imagined vain things;" "the kings of the earth" in Herod, 
and the rulers in Annas and Caiaphas, were gathered together against the Lord, 
and against His anointed." He, again, was "led as a sheep to the slaughter, and 
as a sheep before the shearer," that is, Herod, "is dumb, so He opened not His 
mouth." "He gave His back to scourges, and His cheeks to blows, not turning His 
face even from the shame of spitting." "He was numbered with the transgressors;" 
"He was pierced in His hands and His feet;" "they cast lots for his raiment" 
"they gave Him gall, and made Him drink vinegar;" "they shook their heads, and 
mocked Him;" "He was appraised by the traitor in thirty pieces of silver." What 
figures of speech does Isaiah here give us? What tropes does David? What 
allegories does Jeremiah? Not even of His mighty works have they used parabolic 
language. Or else, were not the eyes of the blind opened? did not the tongue of 
the dumb recover speech? did not the relaxed hands and palsied knees become 
strong, and the lame leap as an hart? No doubt we are accustomed also to give a 
spiritual significance to these statements of prophecy, according to the analogy 
of the physical diseases which were healed by the Lord; but still they were all 
fulfilled literally: thus showing that the prophets foretold both senses, except 
that very many of their words can only be taken in a pure and simple 
signification, and free from all allegorical obscurity; as when we hear of the 
downfall of nations and cities, of Tyre and Egypt, and Babylon and Edom, and the 
navy of Carthage; also when they foretell Israel's own chastisements and 
pardons, its captivities, restorations, and at last its final dispersion. Who 
would prefer affixing a metaphorical interpretation to all these events, instead 
of accepting their literal truth? The realities are involved in the words, just 
as the words are read in the realities. Thus, then, (we find that) the 
allegorical style is not used in all 560 
parts of the prophetic record, although it occasionally occurs in certain 
portions of it. 
CHAP. XXI.--NO MERE METAPHOR IN THE PHRASE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD. 
IN pROPORTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF ETERNAL TRUTHS, IS THE CLEARNESS OF 
THEIR SCRIPTURAL ENUNCIATION.
Well, if it occurs occasionally in certain portions of it, you will say, then 
why not in that phrase, where the resurrection might be spiritually understood? 
There are several reasons why not. First, what must be the meaning of so many 
important passages of Holy Scripture, which so obviously attest the resurrection 
of the body, as to admit not even the appearance of a figurative signification? 
And, indeed, (since some passages are more obscure than others), it cannot but 
be right--as we have shown above--that uncertain statements should be determined 
by certain ones, and obscure ones by such as are clear and plain; else there is 
fear that, in the conflict of certainties and uncertainties, of explicitness and 
obscurity, faith may be shattered, truth endangered, and the Divine Being 
Himself be branded as inconstant. Then arises the improbability that the very 
mystery on which our trust wholly rests, on which also our instruction entirely 
depends, should have the appearance of being ambiguously announced and obscurely 
propounded, inasmuch as the hope of the resurrection, unless it be clearly set 
forth on the sides both of punishment and reward, would fail to persuade any to 
embrace a religion like ours, exposed as it is to public detestation and the 
imputation of hostility to others. There is no certain work where the 
remuneration is uncertain. There is no real apprehension when the peril is only 
doubtful. But both the recompense of reward, and the danger of losing it, depend 
on the issues of the resurrection. Now, if even those purposes of God against 
cities, and nations, and kings, which are merely temporal, local, and personal 
in their character, have been proclaimed so clearly in prophecy, how is it to be 
supposed that those dispensations of His which are eternal, and of universal 
concern to the human race, should be void of all real light in themselves? The 
grander they are, the clearer should be their announcement, in order that their 
superior greatness might be believed. And I apprehend that God cannot possibly 
have ascribed to Him either envy, or guile, or inconsistency, or artifice, by 
help of which evil qualities it is that all schemes of unusual grandeur are 
litigiously promulgated. 
CHAP. XXII.--THE SCRIPTURES FORBID OUR SUPPOSING EITHER THAT THE 
RESURRECTION IS ALREADY PAST, OR THAT IT TAKES PLACE IMMEDIATELY AT DEATH. OUR 
HOPES AND PRAYERS POINT TO THE LAST GREAT DAY AS THE PERIOD OF ITS 
ACCOMPLISHMENT.
We must after all this turn our attention to those scriptures also which 
forbid our belief in such a resurrection as is held by your Animalists (for I 
will not call them Spiritualists), that it is either to be assumed as taking 
place now, as soon as men come to the knowledge of the truth, or else that it is 
accomplished immediately after their departure from this life. Now, forasmuch as 
the seasons of our entire hope have been fixed in the Holy Scripture, and since 
we are not permitted to place the accomplishment thereof, as I apprehend, 
previous to Christ's coming, our prayers are directed towards the end of this 
world, to the passing away thereof at the great day of the Lord--of His wrath 
and vengeance--the last day, which is hidden (from all), and known to none but 
the Father, although announced beforehand by signs and wonders, and the 
dissolution of the elements, and the conflicts of nations. I would turn out the 
words of the prophets, if the Lord Himself had said nothing (except that 
prophecies were the Lord's own word); but it is more to my purpose that He by 
His own mouth confirms their statement. Being questioned by His disciples when 
those things were to come to pass which He had just been uttering about the 
destruction of the temple, He discourses to them first of the order of Jewish 
events until the overthrow of Jerusalem, and then of such as concerned all 
nations up to the very end of the world. For after He had declared that 
"Jerusalem was to be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the 
Gentiles should be fulfilled,"--meaning, of course, those which were to be 
chosen of God, and gathered in with the remnant of Israel--He then goes on to 
proclaim, against this world and dispensation (even as Joel had done, and 
Daniel, and all the prophets with one consent), that "there should be signs in 
the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars, distress of nations with perplexity, 
the sea and the waves roaring, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for 
looking after those things which are coming on the 561 
earth." "For," says He, "the powers of heaven shall be shaken; and then shall 
they see the Son of man coming in the clouds, with power and great glory. And 
when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads, 
for your redemption draweth nigh." He spake of its "drawing nigh," not of its 
being present already; and of "those things beginning to come to pass," not of 
their having happened: because when they have come to pass, then our redemption 
shall be at hand, which is said to be approaching up to that time, raising and 
exciting our minds to what is then the proximate harvest of our hope. He 
immediately annexes a parable of this in "the trees which are tenderly sprouting 
into a flower-stalk, and then developing the flower, which is the precursor of 
the fruit." "So likewise ye," (He adds), "when ye shall see all these things 
come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand." "Watch ye, 
therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all those 
things, and to stand before the Son of man;" that is, no doubt, at the 
resurrection, after all these things have been previously transacted. Therefore, 
although there is a sprouting in the acknowledgment of all this mystery, yet it 
is only in the actual presence of the Lord that the flower is developed and the 
fruit borne. Who is it then, that has aroused the Lord, now at God's right hand 
so unseasonably and with such severity "shake terribly" (as Isaiah expresses it 
("that earth," 
which, I suppose, is as yet unshattered? Who has thus early put "Christ's 
enemies beneath His feet" (to use the lan-guage of David), making Him more 
hurried than the Father, whilst every crowd in our popular assemblies is still 
with shouts consigning "the Christians to the lions?" Who has yet beheld Jesus 
descending from heaven in like manner as the apostles saw Him ascend, according 
to the appointment of the two angels? Up to the present moment they have not, 
tribe by tribe, smitten their breasts, looking on Him whom they pierced. No one 
has as yet fallen in with Elias; no one has as yet escaped from Antichrist; no 
one has as yet had to bewail the downfall of Babylon. And is there now anybody 
who has risen again, except the heretic? He, of course, has already quitted the 
grave of his own corpse--although he is even now liable to fevers and ulcers; 
he, too, has already trodden down his enemies--although he has even now to 
struggle with the powers of the world. And as a matter of course, he is already 
a king--although he even now owes to Caesar the things which are Caesar's. 
CHAP. XXIII.--SUNDRY PASSAGES OF ST. PAUL, WHICH SPEAK OF A 
SPIRITUAL RESURRECTION, COMPATIBLE WITH THE FUTURE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY, 
WHICH IS EVEN ASSUMED IN THEM.
The apostle indeed teaches, in his Epistle to the Colossians, that we were 
once dead, alienated, and enemies to the Lord in our minds, whilst we were 
living in wicked works; that we were then buried with Christ in baptism, and 
also raised again with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath 
raised Him from the dead. "And you, (adds he), when ye were dead in sins and the 
uncircumcision of your flesh, hath He quickened together with Him, having 
forgiven you all trespasses." And again: "If ye are dead with Christ from the 
elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to 
ordinances?" Now, since he makes us spiritually dead--in such a way, however, as 
to allow that we shall one day have to undergo a bodily death,--so, considering 
indeed that we have been also raised in a like spiritual sense, he equally 
allows that we shall further have to undergo a bodily resurrection. In so many 
words he says: "Since ye are risen with Christ, seek those things which are 
above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Set your affection on 
things above, not on things on the earth." Accordingly, it is in our mind that 
he shows that we rise (with Christ), since it is by this alone that we are as 
yet able to reach to heavenly objects. These we should not "seek," nor "set our 
affection on," if we had them already in our possession. He also adds: "For ye 
are dead"--to your sins, he means, not to yourselves--"and your life is hid with 
Christ in God." Now that life is not yet apprehended which is hidden. In like 
manner John says: "And it doth not yet ap 562 
pear what we shall be: we know, however, that when He shall be manifest, we 
shall be like Him." We are far indeed from being already what we know not of; we 
should, of course, be sure to know it if we were already (like Him). It is 
therefore the contemplation of our blessed hope even in this life by faith (that 
he speaks of)--not its presence nor its possession, but only its expectation. 
Concerning this expectation and hope Paul writes to the Galatians: "For we 
through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith." He says "we 
wait for it," not we are in possession of it. By the righteousness of God, he 
means that judgment which we shall have to undergo as the recompense of our 
deeds. It is in expectation of this for himself that the apostle writes to the 
Philippians: "If by any means," says he, "I might attain to the resurrection of 
the dead. Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect." And 
yet he had believed, and had known all mysteries, as an elect vessel and the 
great teacher of the Gentiles; but for all that he goes on to say: "I, however, 
follow on, if so be I may apprehend that for which I also am apprehended of 
Christ." Nay, more: "Brethren," (he adds), "I count not myself to have 
apprehended: but this one thing (I do), forgetting those things which are 
behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward 
the mark for the prize of blamelessness, whereby I may attain it;" meaning the 
resurrection from the dead in its proper time. Even as he says to the 
Gala-tians: "Let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall 
reap." Similarly, concerning Onesiphorus, does he also write to Timothy: "The 
Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy in that day;" unto which day and time 
he charges Timothy himself "to keep what had been committed to his care, without 
spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ: which in His 
times He shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings 
and Lord of lords," speaking of (Him as) God It is to these same times that 
Peter in the Acts refers, when he says: "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, 
that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from 
the presence of the Lord; and He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was 
preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution 
of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of His holy prophets." 
CHAP. XXIV.--OTHER PASSAGES QUOTED FROM ST. PAUL, WHICH CATEGORICALLY 
ASSERT THE RESURRECTION OF THE FLESH AT THE FINAL JUDGMENT.
The character of these times learn, along with the Thessalonians. For we 
read: "How ye turned from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait 
for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus." And again: 
"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the 
presence of our Lord God, Jesus Christ, at His coming?" Likewise: "Before God, 
even our Father, at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, with the whole company 
of His saints." He teaches them that they must "not sorrow concerning them that 
are asleep," and at the same time explains to them the times of the 
resurrection, saying, "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so 
them also which sleep in Jesus shall God bring with Him. For this we say unto 
you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming 
of our Lord, shall not prevent them that are asleep. For the Lord Himself shall 
descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the 
trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive 
and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord 
in the air; and so shall we be ever with the Lord." What archangel's voice, (I 
wonder), what trump of God is now heard, except it be, forsooth, in the 
entertainments of the heretics? For, allowing that the word of the gospel may be 
called "the trump of God," since it was still calling men, yet they must at that 
time either be dead as to the body, that they may be able to rise again; and 
then how are they alive? Or else caught up into the clouds; and how then are 
they here? "Most miserable," 
no doubt, as the apostle declared them, are they "who in this life only" 
shall be found to have hope: they will have to be excluded while they are with 
premature haste seizing that which is promised after this life; erring 
concerning the truth, no less than Phygellus and Hermogenes. Hence it is that 
the Holy Ghost, in His greatness, foresee 563 
ing clearly all such interpretations as these, suggests (to the apostle), in 
this very epistle of his to the Thessalonians, as follows: "But of the times and 
the seasons, brethren, there is no necessity for my writing unto you. For ye 
yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the 
night. For when they shall say, 'Peace,' and 'All things are safe,' then sudden 
destruction shall come upon them." Again, in the second epistle he addresses 
them with even greater earnestness: "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the coming 
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto Him, that ye be not 
soon shaken in mind, nor be troubled, either by spirit, or by word," that is, 
the word of false prophets, "or by letter," that is, the letter of false 
apostles, "as if from us, as that the day of the Lord is at hand. Let no man 
deceive you by any means. For that day shall not come, unless indeed there first 
come a falling away," he means indeed of this present empire, "and that man of 
sin be revealed," that is to say, Antichrist, "the son of perdition, who 
opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or religion; so that 
he sitteth in the temple of God, affirming that he is God. Remember ye not, that 
when I was with you, I used to tell you these things? And now ye know what 
detaineth, that he might be revealed in his time. 
For the mystery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now hinders must 
hinder, until he be taken out of the way." What obstacle is there but the Roman 
state, the falling away of which, by being scattered into ten kingdoms, shall 
introduce Antichrist upon (its own ruins)? "And then shall be revealed the 
wicked one, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall 
destroy with the brightness of His coming: even him whose coming is after the 
working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all 
deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish." 
CHAP. XXV.--ST. JOHN, IN THE APOCALYPSE, EQUALLY EXPLICIT IN ASSERTING THE 
SAME GREAT DOCTRINE.
In the Revelation of John, again, the order of these times is spread out to 
view, which "the souls of the martyrs" are taught to wait for beneath the altar, 
whilst they earnestly pray to be avenged and judged: (taught, I say, to wait), 
in order that the world may first drink to the dregs the plagues that await it 
out of the vials of the angels, and that the city of fornication may receive 
from the ten kings its deserved doom, and that the beast Antichrist with his 
false prophet may wage war on the Church of God; and that, after the casting of 
the devil into the bottomless pit for a while, the blessed prerogative of the 
first resurrection may be ordained from the thrones; and then again, after the 
consignment of him to the fire, that the judgment of the final and universal 
resurrection may be determined out of the books. Since, then, the Scriptures 
both indicate the stages of the last times, and concentrate the harvest of the 
Christian hope in the very end of the world, it is evident, either that all 
which God promises to us receives its accomplishment then, and thus what the 
heretics pretend about a resurrection here falls to the ground; or else, even 
allowing that a confession of the mystery (of divine truth) is a resurrection, 
that there is, without any detriment to this view, room for believing in that 
which is announced for the end. It moreover follows, that the very maintenance 
of this spiritual resurrection amounts to a presumption in favour of the other 
bodily resurrection; for if none were announced for that time, there would be 
fair ground for asserting only this purely spiritual resurrection. Inasmuch, 
however, as (a resurrection) is proclaimed for the last time, it is proved to be 
a bodily one, because there is no spiritual one also then announced. For why 
make a second announcement of a resurrection of only one character, that is, the 
spiritual one, since this ought to be undergoing accomplishment either now, 
without any regard to different times, or else then, at the very conclusion of 
all the periods? It is therefore more competent for us even to maintain a 
spiritual resurrection a the commencement of a life of faith, who acknowledge 
the full completion thereof at the end of the world CHAP. XXVI.--EVEN THE 
METAPHORICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF THIS SUBJECT IN THE SCRIPTURES POINT TO THE BODILY 
RESURRECTION, THE ONLY SENSE WHICH SECURES THEIR CONSISTENCY AND 
DIGNITY.
To a preceding objection, that the Scriptures are allegorical, I have still 
one answer to make--that it is open to us also to defend the bodily character of 
the resurrection by means of the language of the prophets, which is equally 
figurative. For consider that primeval sentence which God spake when He called 
man earth; saying, "Earth thou art, and to earth shalt thou return." In respect, 
of course, 564 
to his fleshly substance, which had been taken out of the ground, and which 
was the first to receive the name of man, as we have already shown, does not 
this passage give one instruction to interpret in relation to the flesh also 
whatever of wrath or of grace God has determined for the earth, because, 
strictly speaking, the earth is not exposed to His judgment, since it has never 
done any good or evil? "Cursed," no doubt, it was, for it drank the blood of 
man; but even this was as a figure of homicidal flesh. For if the earth has to 
suffer either joy or injury, it is simply on man's account, that he may suffer 
the joy or the sorrow through the events which happen to his dwelling-place, 
whereby he will rather have to pay the penalty which, simply on his account, 
even the earth must suffer. When, therefore, God even threatens the earth, I 
would prefer saying that He threatens the flesh: so likewise, when He makes a 
promise to the earth, I would rather understand Him as promising the flesh; as 
in that passage of David: "The Lord is King, let the earth be glad,"--meaning 
the flesh of the saints, to which appertains the enjoyment of the kingdom of 
God. Then he afterwards says: "The earth saw and trembled; the mountains melted 
like wax at the presence of the Lord,"--meaning, no doubt the flesh of the 
wicked; and (in a similar sense) it is written: "For they shall look on Him whom 
they pierced." If indeed it will be thought that both these passages were 
pronounced simply of the element earth, how can it be consistent that it should 
shake and melt at the presence of the Lord, at whose royal dignity it before 
exulted? So again in Isaiah, "Ye shall eat the good of the land," the expression 
means the blessings which await the flesh when in the kingdom of God it shall be 
renewed, and made like the angels, and waiting to obtain the things "which 
neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, and which have not entered into the heart 
of man." Otherwise, how vain that God should invite men to obedience by the 
fruits of the field and the elements of this life, when He dispenses these to 
even irreligious men and blasphemers; on a general condition once for all made 
to man, "sending rain on the good and on the evil, and making His sun to shine 
on the just and on the unjust!" Happy, no doubt, is faith, if it is to obtain 
gifts which the enemies of God and Christ not only use, but even abuse, 
"worshipping the creature itself in opposition to the Creator!" You will reckon, 
(I 
suppose) onions and truffles among earth's bounties, since the Lord declares 
that "man shall not live on bread alone!" In this way the Jews lose heavenly 
blessings, by confining their hopes to earthly ones, being ignorant of the 
promise of heavenly bread, and of the oil of God's unction, and the wine of the 
Spirit, and of that water of life which has its vigour from the vine of Christ. 
On exactly the same principle, they consider the special soil of Judaea to be 
that very holy land, which ought rather to be interpreted of the Lord's flesh, 
which, in all those who put on Christ, is thenceforward the holy land; holy 
indeed by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, truly flowing with milk and honey by 
the sweetness of His assurance, truly Judaean by reason of the friendship of 
God. For "he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, but he who is one inwardly." 
In the same way it is that both God's temple and Jerusalem (must be understood) 
when it is said by Isaiah: "Awake, awake, O 
Jerusalem! put on the strength of thine arm; awake, as in thine earliest 
time," that is to say, in that innocence which preceded the fall into sin. For 
how can words of this kind of exhortation and invitation be suitable for that 
Jerusalem which killed the prophets, and stoned those that were sent to them, 
and at last crucified its very Lord? Neither indeed is salvation promised to any 
one land at all, which must needs pass away with the fashion of the whole world. 
Even if anybody should venture strongly to contend that paradise is the holy 
land, which it may be possible to designate as the land of our first parents 
Adam and Eve, it will even then follow that the restoration of paradise will 
seem to be promised to the flesh, whose lot it was to inhabit and keep it, in 
order that man may be recalled thereto just such as he was driven from it. 
CHAP. XXVII.--CERTAIN METAPHORICAL TERMS EXPLAINED OF THE RESURRECTION OF 
THE FLESH.
We have also in the Scriptures robes mentioned as allegorizing the hope of 
the flesh. Thus in the Revelation of John it is said: "These are they which have 
not defiled their clothes with women,"--indicating, of course, virgins, and such 
as have become "eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake." Therefore they shall 
be "clothed in white rai 565 
ment," that is, in the bright beauty of the unwedded flesh. In the gospel 
even, "the wedding garment" may be regarded as the sanctity of the flesh. And 
so, when Isaiah tells us what sort of "fast the Lord hath chosen," and subjoins 
a statement about the reward of good works, he says: "Then shall thy light break 
forth as the morning, and thy garments, shall speedily arise;" where he has no 
thought of cloaks or stuff gowns, but means the rising of the flesh, which he 
declared the resurrection of, after its fall in death. Thus we are furnished 
even with an allegorical defence of the resurrection of the body. When, then, we 
read, "Go, my people, enter into your closets for a little season, until my 
anger pass away," we have in the closets graves, in which they will have to rest 
for a little while, who shall have at the end of the world departed this life in 
the last furious onset of the power of Antichrist. Why else did He use the 
expression closets, in preference to some other receptacle, if it were not that 
the flesh is kept in these closets or cellars salted and reserved for use, to be 
drawn out thence on a suitable occasion? It is on a like principle that embalmed 
corpses are set aside for burial in mausoleums and sepulchres, in order that 
they may be removed therefrom when the Master shall order it. Since, therefore, 
there is consistency in thus understanding the passage (for what refuge of 
little closets could possibly shelter us from the wrath of God?), it appears 
that by the very phrase which he uses, "Until His anger pass away," which shall 
extinguish Antichrist, he in fact shows that after that indignation the flesh 
will come forth from the sepulchre, in which it had been deposited previous to 
the bursting out of the anger. Now out of the closets nothing else is brought 
than that which had been put into them, and after the extirpation of Antichrist 
shall be busily transacted the great process of the resurrection. 
CHAP. XXVIII.--PROPHETIC THINGS AND ACTIONS, AS WELL AS WORDS, ATTEST THIS 
GREAT DOCTRINE.
But we know that prophecy expressed itself by things no less than by words. 
By words, and also by deeds, is the resurrection foretold. When Moses puts his 
hand into his bosom, and then draws it out again dead, and again puts his hand 
into his bosom, and plucks it out living, does not this apply as a presage to 
all mankind?--inasmuch as those three signs denoted the threefold power of God: 
when it shall, first, in the appointed order, subdue to man the old serpent, the 
devil, however formidable; then, secondly, draw forth the flesh from the bosom 
of death; and then, at last, shall pursue all blood (shed) in judgment. On this 
subject we read in the writings of the same prophet, (how that) God says: "For 
your blood of your lives will I require of all wild beasts; and I will require 
it of the hand of man, and of his brother's hand." Now nothing is required 
except that which is demanded back again, and nothing is thus demanded except 
that which is to be given up; and that will of course be given up, which shall 
be demanded and required on the ground of vengeance. But indeed there cannot 
possibly be punishment of that which never had any existence. Existence, 
however, it will have, when it is restored in order to be punished. To the 
flesh, therefore, applies everything which is declared respecting the blood, for 
without the flesh there cannot be blood. The flesh will be raised up in order 
that the blood may be punished. There are, again, some statements (of Scripture) 
so plainly made as to be free from all obscurity of allegory, and yet they 
strongly require their very simplicity to be interpreted. There is, for 
instance, that passage in Isaiah: "I will kill, and I will make alive." 
Certainly His making alive is to take place after He has killed. As, therefore, 
it is by death that He kills, it is by the resurrection that He will make alive. 
Now it is the flesh which is killed by death; the flesh, therefore, will be 
revived by the resurrection. Surely if killing means taking away life from the 
flesh, and its opposite, reviving, amounts to restoring life to the flesh, it 
must needs be that the flesh rise again, to which the life, which has been taken 
away by killing, has to be restored by vivification. 
CHAP. XXIX.--EZEKIEL'S VISION OF THE DRY
BONES QUOTED.
Inasmuch, then, as even the figurative portions of Scripture, and the 
arguments of facts, and some plain statements of Holy Writ, throw light upon the 
resurrection of the flesh (although without specially naming the very 
substance), how much more effectual for de 566 
termining the question will not those passages be which indicate the actual 
substance of the body by expressly mentioning it! Take Ezekiel: "And the hand of 
the Lord," says he, "was upon me; and the Lord brought me forth in the Spirit, 
and set me in the midst of a plain which was full of bones; and He led me round 
about them in a circuit: and, behold, there were many on the face of the plain; 
and, lo, they were very dry. And He said unto me, Son of man, will these bones 
live? And I said, O Lord God, Thou knowest. And He said unto me, Prophesy upon 
these bones; and thou shalt say, Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus 
saith the Lord God to these bones, Behold, I bring upon you the breath of life, 
and ye shall live: and I will give unto you the spirit, and I will place muscles 
over you, and I will spread skin upon you; and ye shall live, and shall know 
that I am the Lord. And I prophesied as the Lord commanded me: and while I 
prophesy, behold there is a voice, behold also a movement, and bones approached 
bones. And I saw, and behold sinews and flesh came up over them, and muscles 
were placed around them; but there was no breath in them. And He said unto me, 
Prophesy to the wind, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God, 
Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe in these dead men, and let them 
live. So I prophesied to the wind, as He commanded me, and the spirit entered 
into the bones, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, strong and exceeding 
many. And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of 
Israel. They say themselves, Our bones are become dry, and our hope is perished, 
and we in them have been violently destroyed. Therefore prophesy unto them, (and 
say), Behold, even I will open your sepulchres, and will bring you out of your 
sepulchres, O my people, and will bring you into the land of Israel: and ye 
shall know how that I the Lord opened your sepulchres, and brought you, O my 
people, out of your sepulchres; and I will give my Spirit unto you, and ye shall 
live, and shall rest in your own land: and ye shall know how that I the Lord 
have spoken and done these things, saith the Lord." 
CHAP. XXX.--THIS VISION INTERPRETED BY TERTULLIAN OF THE RESURRECTION OF 
THE BODIES OF THE DEAD. A CHRONOLOGICAL ERROR OF OUR AUTHOR, WHO SUPPOSES 
THAT EZEKIEL IN HIS CH. XXXI. PROPHESIED BEFORE THE CAPTIVITY.
I am well aware how they torture even this prophecy into a proof of the 
allegorical sense, on the ground that by saying, "These bones are the whole 
house of Israel," He made them a figure of Israel, and removed them from their 
proper literal condition; and therefore (they contend) that there is here a 
figurative, not a true prediction of the resurrection, for (they say) the state 
of the Jews is one of humiliation, in a certain sense dead, and very dry, and 
dispersed over the plain of the world. Therefore the image of a resurrection is 
allegorically applied to their state, since it has to be gathered together, and 
recompacted bone to bone (in other words, tribe to tribe, and people to people), 
and to be reincorporated by the sinews of power and the nerves of royalty, and 
to be brought out as it were from sepulchres, that is to say, from the most 
miserable and degraded abodes of captivity, and to breathe afresh in the way of 
a restoration, and to live thenceforward in their own land of Judaea. And what 
is to happen after all this? They will die, no doubt. And what will there be 
after death? No resurrection from the dead, of course, since there is nothing of 
the sort here revealed to Ezekiel. Well, but the resurrection is elsewhere 
foretold: so that there will be one even in this case, and they are rash in 
applying this passage to the state of Jewish affairs; or even if it do indicate 
a different recovery from the resurrection which we are maintaining, what 
matters it to me, provided there be also a resurrection of the body, just as 
there is a restoration of the Jewish state? In fact, by the very circumstance 
that the recovery of the Jewish state is prefigured by the reincorporation and 
reunion of bones, proof is offered that this event will also happen to the bones 
themselves; for the metaphor could not have been formed from bones, if the same 
thing exactly were not to be realized in them also. Now, although there is a 
sketch of the true thing in its image, the image itself still possesses a truth 
of its own: it must needs be, therefore, that must have a prior existence for 
itself, which is used figuratively to express some other thing. Vacuity is not a 
consistent basis for a similitude, nor does nonentity form a suitable foundation 
for a parable. It will therefore be right to believe that the bones are destined 
to have a rehabiliment of flesh and breath, such as it is here said they will 
have, by reason indeed of which their renewed state could alone express the 
reformed condition of Jewish affairs, which is pretended to be the meaning of 
this passage. It is. however, more characteristic of a religious spirit to 
maintain the truth on the authority of a literal interpretation, such as is 
required 567 
by the sense of the inspired passage. Now, if this vision had reference to 
the condition of the Jews, as soon as He had revealed to him the position of the 
bones, He would at once have added, "These bones are the whole house of Israel," 
and so forth. But immediately on showing the bones, He interrupts the scene by 
saying somewhat of the prospect which is most suited to bones; without yet 
naming Israel, He tries the prophet's own faith: "Son of man, can these bones 
ever live?" so that he makes answer: "O Lord, Thou knowest." Now God would not, 
you may be sure, have tried the prophet's faith on a point which was never to be 
a real one, of which Israel should never hear, and in which it was not proper to 
repose belief. Since, however, the resurrection of the dead was indeed foretold, 
but Israel, in the distrust of his great unbelief, was offended at it; and, 
whilst gazing on the condition of the crumbling grave, despaired of a 
resurrection; or rather, did not direct his mind mainly to it, but to his own 
harassing circumstances,--therefore God first instructed the prophet (since he, 
too, was not free from doubt), by revealing to him the process of the 
resurrection, with a view to his earnest setting forth of the same. He then 
charged the people to believe what He had revealed to the prophet, telling them 
that they were themselves, though refusing to believe their resurrection, the 
very bones which were destined to rise again. Then in the concluding sentence He 
says, "And ye shall know how that I the Lord have spoken and done these things," 
intending of course to do that of which He had spoken; but certainly not meaning 
to do that which He had spoken of, if His design had been to do something 
different from what He had said. 
CHAP. XXXI.--OTHER PASSAGES OUT OF THE PROPHETS APPLIED TO THE 
RESURRECTION OF THE FLESH.
Unquestionably, if the people were indulging in figurative murmurs that their 
bones were become dry, and that their hope had perished--plaintive at the 
consequences of their dispersion--then God might fairly enough seem to have 
consoled their figurative despair with a figurative promise. Since, however, no 
injury had as yet alighted on the people from their dispersion, although the 
hope of the resurrection had very frequently failed amongst them, it is manifest 
that it was owing to the perishing condition of their bodies that their faith in 
the resurrection was shaken. God, therefore was rebuilding the faith which the 
people were pulling down. But even if it were true that Israel was then 
depressed at some shock in their existing circumstances, we must not on that 
account suppose that the purpose of revelation could have rested in a parable: 
its aim must have been to testify a resurrection, in order to raise the nation's 
hope to even an eternal salvation and an indispensable restoration, and thereby 
turn off their minds from brooding over their present affairs. This indeed is 
the aim of other prophets likewise. "Ye shall go forth," (says Malachi), "from 
your sepulchres, as young calves let loose from their bonds, and ye shall tread 
down your enemies." And again, (Isaiah says): "Your heart shall rejoice, and 
your bones shall spring up like the grass," because the grass also is renewed by 
the dissolution and corruption of the seed. In a word, if it is contended that 
the figure of the rising bones refers properly to the state of Israel, why is 
the same hope announced to all nations, instead of being limited to Israel only, 
of reinvesting those osseous remains with bodily substance and vital breath, and 
of raising up their dead out of the grave? For the language is universal: "The 
dead shall arise, and come forth from their graves; for the dew which cometh 
from Thee is medicine to their bones." In another passage it is written: 
"All flesh shall come to worship before me, saith the Lord." When? When the 
fashion of this world shall begin to pass away. For He said before: "As the new 
heaven and the new earth, which I make, remain before me, saith the Lord, so 
shall your seed remain." Then also shall be fulfilled what is written 
afterwards: "And they shall go forth" (namely, from their graves), "and shall 
see the carcases of those who have transgressed: for their worm shall never die, 
nor shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh" 
even to that which, being raised again from the dead and brought out from the 
grave, shall adore the Lord for this great grace. 
CHAP. XXXII.--EVEN UNBURIED BODIES WILL BE RAISED AGAIN. WHATEVER BEFALLS 
THEM GOD WILL RESTORE THEM AGAIN. JONAH'S CASE QUOTED IN ILLUSTRATION OF 
GOD'S POWER.
But, that you may not suppose that it is merely those bodies which are 
consigned to tombs whose resurrection is foretold, you have it declared in 
Scripture: "And I will com 568 
mand the fishes of the sea, and they shall cast up the bones which they have 
devoured; and I will bring joint to joint, and bone to bone." You will ask, Will 
then the fishes and other animals and carnivorous birds be raised again, in 
order that they may vomit up what they have consumed, on the ground of your 
reading in the law of Moses, that blood is required of even all the beasts? 
Certainly not. But the beasts and the fishes are mentioned in relation to the 
restoration of flesh and blood, in order the more emphatically to express the 
resurrection of such bodies as have even been devoured, when redress is said to 
be demanded of their very devourers. Now I apprehend that in the case of Jonah 
we have a fair proof of this divine power, when he comes forth from the fish's 
belly uninjured in both his natures--his flesh and his soul. No doubt the bowels 
of the whale would have had abundant time during three days for consuming and 
digesting Jonah's flesh, quite as effectually as a coffin, or a tomb, or the 
gradual decay of some quiet and concealed grave; only that he wanted to 
prefigure even those beasts (which symbolize) especially the men who are wildly 
opposed to the Christian name, or the angels of iniquity, of whom blood will be 
required by the full exaction of an avenging judgment. Where, then, is the man 
who, being more disposed to learn than to assume, more careful to believe than 
to dispute, and more scrupulous of the wisdom of God than wantonly bent on his 
own, when he hears of a divine purpose respecting sinews and skin, and nerves 
and bones, will forthwith devise some different application of these words, as 
if all that is said of the substances in question were not naturally intended 
for man? For either there is here no reference to the destiny of man--in the 
gracious provision of the kingdom (of heaven), in the severity of the 
judgment-day, in all the incidents of the resurrection; or else, if there is any 
reference to his destiny, the destination must necessarily be made in reference 
to those substances of which the man is composed, for whom the destiny is 
reserved. Another question I have also to ask of these very adroit transformers 
of bones and sinews, and nerves and sepulchres: Why, when anything is declared 
of the soul, do they not interpret the soul to be something else, and transfer 
it to another signification?--since, whenever any distinct statement is made of 
a bodily substance, they will obstinately prefer taking any other sense 
whatever, rather than that which the name indicates. If things which pertain to 
the body are figurative, why are not those which pertain to the soul figurative 
also? Since, however, things which belong to the soul have nothing allegorical 
in them, neither therefore have those which belong to the body. For man is as 
much body as he is soul; so that it is impossible for one of these natures to 
admit a figurative sense, and the other to exclude it. 
CHAP. XXXIII.--SO MUCH FOR THE PROPHETIC SCRIPTURES. IN THE GOSPELS, 
CHRIST'S
PARABLES, AS EXPLAINED BY HIMSELF, HAVE A CLEAR REFERENCE TO THE 
RESURRECTION
OF THE FLESH.
This is evidence enough from the prophetic Scriptures. I now appeal to the 
Gospels. But here also I must first meet the same sophistry as advanced by those 
who contend that the Lord, like (the prophets), said everything in the way of 
allegory, because it is written: "All these things spake Jesus in parables, and 
without a parable spake He not unto them," that is, to the Jews. Now the 
disciples also asked Him, "Why speakest Thou in parables?" And the Lord gave 
them this answer: "Therefore I speak unto them in parables: because they seeing, 
see not; and hearing, they hear not, according to the prophecy of Esaias." But 
since it was to the Jews that He spoke in parables, it was not then to all men; 
and if not to all, it follows that it was not always and in all things parables 
with Him, but only in certain things, and when addressing a particular class. 
But He addressed a particular class when He spoke to the Jews. It is true that 
He spoke sometimes even to the disciples in parables. But observe how the 
Scripture relates such a fact: "And He spake a parable unto them." It follows, 
then, that He did not usually address them in parables; because if He always did 
so, special mention would not be made of His resorting to this mode of address. 
Besides, there is not a parable which you will not find to be either explained 
by the Lord Himself, as that of the sower, (which He interprets) of the 
management of the word of God; or else cleared by a preface from the writer of 
the Gospel, as in the parable of the arrogant judge and the importunate widow, 
which is expressly applied to earnestness in prayer; or capable of being 
spontaneously understood, as in the parable of the fig-tree, which was spared a 
while in hopes of improve-ment--an emblem of Jewish sterility. Now, 569 
if even parables obscure not the light of the gospel, how unlikely it is that 
plain sentences and declarations, which have an unmistakeable meaning, should 
signify any other thing than their literal sense! But it is by such declarations 
and sentences that the Lord sets forth either the last judgment, or the kingdom, 
or the resurrection: "It shall be more tolerable," He says, "for Tyre and Sidon 
in the day of judgment than far you." And "Tell them that the kingdom of God is 
at hand." And again, "It shall be recompensed to you at the resurrection of the 
just." Now, if the mention of these events (I mean the judgment-day, and the 
kingdom of God, and the resurrection) has a plain and absolute sense, so that 
nothing about them can be pressed into an allegory, neither should those 
statements be forced into parables which describe the arrangement, and the 
process, and the experience of the kingdom of God, and of the judgment, and of 
the resurrection. On the contrary, things which are destined for the body should 
be carefully understood in a bodily sense,--not in a spiritual sense, as having 
nothing figurative in their nature. This is the reason why we have laid it down 
as a preliminary consideration, that the bodily substance both of the soul and 
of the flesh is liable to the recompense, which will have to be awarded in 
return for the co-operation of the two natures, that so the corporeality of the 
soul may not exclude the bodily nature of the flesh by suggesting a recourse to 
figurative descriptions, since both of them must needs be regarded as destined 
to take part in the kingdom, and the judgment, and the resurrection. And now we 
proceed to the special proof of this proposition, that the bodily character of 
the flesh is indicated by our Lord whenever He mentions the resurrection, at the 
same time without disparagement to the corporeal nature of the soul,--a point 
which has been actually admitted but by a few. 
CHAP. XXXIV.--CHRIST PLAINLY TESTIFIES TO THE RESURRECTION OF THE ENTIRE 
MAN. NOT IN HIS SOUL ONLY, WITHOUT THE BODY.
To begin with the passage where He says that He is come to "to seek and to 
save that which is lost." What do you suppose that to be which is lost? Man, 
undoubtedly. The entire man, or only a part of him? The whole man, of course. In 
fact, since the trangression which caused man's ruin was committed quite as much 
by the instigation of the soul from concupiscence as by the action of the flesh 
from actual fruition, it has marked the entire man with the sentence of 
transgression, and has therefore made him deservedly amenable to perdition. So 
that he will be wholly saved, since he has by sinning been wholly lost. Unless 
it be true that the sheep (of the parable) is a" lost" one, irrespective of its 
body; then its recovery may be effected without the body. Since, however, it is 
the bodily substance as well as the soul, making up the entire animal, which was 
carried on the shoulders of the Good Shepherd, we have here unquestionably an 
example how man is restored in both his natures. Else how unworthy it were of 
God to bring only a moiety of man to salvation--and almost less than that; 
whereas the munificence of princes of this world always claims for itself the 
merit of a plenary grace! Then must the devil be understood to be stronger for 
injuring man, ruining him wholly? and must God have the character of comparative 
weakness, since He does not relieve and help man in his entire state? The 
apostle, however, suggests that "where sin abounded, there has grace much more 
abounded." How, in fact, can he be regarded as saved, who can at the same time 
be said to be lost--lost, that is, in the flesh, but saved as to his soul? 
Unless, indeed, their argument now makes it necessary that the soul should be 
placed in a "lost" condition, that it may be susceptible of salvation, on the 
ground that is properly saved which has been lost. We, however, so understand 
the soul's immortality as to believe it "lost," not in the sense of destruction, 
but of punishment, that is, in hell. And if this is the case, then it is not the 
soul which salvation will affect, since it is "safe"already in its own nature by 
reason of its immortality, but rather the flesh, which, as all readily allow, is 
subject to destruction. Else, if the soul is also perishable (in this sense), in 
other words, not immortal--the condition of the flesh--then this same condition 
ought in all fairness to benefit the flesh also, as being similarly mortal and 
perishable, since that which perishes the Lord purposes to save. I do not care 
now to follow the clue of our discussion, so far as to consider whether it is in 
one of his natures or in the other that perdition puts in its claim on man, 
provided that salvation is equally distributed over the two substances, and 
makes him its aim in respect of them both. For observe, in which substance 
so-ever you assume man to have perished, in the other be does not perish. He 
will therefore be saved in the substance in which 570 
he does not perish, and yet obtain salvation in that in which he does perish. 
You have (then) the restoration of the entire man, inasmuch as the Lord purposes 
to save that part of him which perishes, whilst he will not of course lose that 
portion which cannot be lost, Who will any longer doubt of the safety of both 
natures, when one of them is to obtain salvation, and the other is not to lose 
it? And, still further, the Lord explains to us the meaning of the thing when He 
says: "I came not to do my own will, but the Father's, who hath sent me." What, 
I ask, is that will? "That of all which He hath given me I should lose nothing, 
but should raise it up again at the last day." Now, what had Christ received of 
the Father but that which He had Himself put on? Man, of course, in his texture 
of flesh and soul. Neither, therefore, of those parts which He has received will 
He allow to perish; nay, no considerable portion--nay, not the least fraction, 
of either. If the flesh be, as our opponents slightingly think, but a poor 
fraction, then the flesh is safe, because not a fraction of man is to perish; 
and no larger portion is in danger, because every portion of man is in equally 
safe keeping with Him. If, however, He will not raise the flesh also up at the 
last day, then He will permit not only a fraction of man to perish, but (as I 
will venture to say, in consideration of so important a part) almost the whole 
of him. But when He repeats His words with increased emphasis, "And this is the 
Father's will, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may 
have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day,"--He asserts the 
full extent of the resurrection. For He assigns to each several nature that 
reward which is suited to its services: both to the flesh, for by it the Son was 
"seen;" 
and to the soul, for by it He was "believed on." Then, you will say, to them 
was this promise given by whom Christ was "seen." Well, be it so; only let the 
same hope flow on from them to us! For if to them who saw, and therefore 
believed, such fruit then accrued to the operations of the flesh and the soul, 
how much more to us! For more "blessed," says Christ, "are they who have not 
seen, and yet have believed;" since, even if the resurrection of the flesh must 
be denied to them, it must at any rate be a fitting boon to us, who are the more 
blessed. For how could we be blessed, if we were to perish in any part of us? 
CHAP. XXXV.--EXPLANATION OF WHAT IS MEANT BY THE BODY, WHICH IS TO BE 
RAISED AGAIN. NOT THE CORPOREALITY OF THE SOUL.
But He also teaches us, that "He is rather to be feared, who is able to 
destroy both body and soul in hell," that is, the Lord alone; "not those which 
kill the body, but are not able to hurt the soul," that is to say, all bureau 
powers. Here, then, we have a recognition of the natural immortality of the 
soul, which cannot be killed by men; and of the mortality of the body, which may 
be killed: whence we learn that the resurrection of the dead is a resurrection 
of the flesh; for unless it were raised again, it would be impossible for the 
flesh to be "killed in hell." But as a question may be here captiously raised 
about the meaning of "the body" (or "the flesh "), I will at once state that I 
understand by the human body nothing else than that fabric of the flesh which, 
whatever be the kind of material of which it is constructed and modified, is 
seen and handled, and sometimes indeed killed, by men. In like manner, I should 
not admit that anything but cement and stones and bricks form the body of a 
wall. If any one imports into our argument some body of a subtle, secret nature, 
he must show, disclose, and prove to me that identical body is the very one 
which was slain by human violence, and then (I will grant) that it is of such a 
body that (our scripture) speaks. If, again, the body or corporeal nature of the 
soul is cast in my teeth. it will only be an idle subterfuge! For since both 
substances are set before us (in this passage, which affirms) that "body and 
soul" are destroyed in bell, a distinction is obviously made between the two; 
and we are left to understand the body to be that which is tangible to us, that 
is, the flesh, which, as it will be destroyed in hell--since it did not "rather 
fear" being destroyed by God--so also will it be restored to life eternal, since 
it preferred to be killed by human hands. If, therefore, any one shall violently 
suppose that the destruction of the soul and the flesh in hell amounts to a 
final annihilation of the two substances, and not to their penal treatment (as 
if they were to be consumed, not punished), let him recollect that the fire of 
hell is eternal--expressly announced as an everlasting penalty; and let him then 
admit that it is from this circumstance that this never-ending "killing" is more 
formidable than a merely human murder, which is only temporal. He will then 571 
come to the conclusion that substances must be eternal, when their penal 
"killing" is an eternal one. Since, then, the body after the resurrection has to 
be killed by God in hell along with the soul, we surely have sufficient 
information in this fact respecting both the issues which await it, namely the 
resurrection of the flesh, and its eternal "killing." Else it would be most 
absurd if the flesh should be raised up and destined to "the killing in hell," 
in order to be put an end to, when it might suffer such an annihilation (more 
directly) if not raised again at all. A pretty paradox, to be sure, that an 
essence must be refitted with life, in order that it may receive that 
annihilation which has already in fact accrued to it! But Christ, whilst 
confirming us in the selfsame hope, adds the example of "the sparrows"--how that 
"not one of them falls to the ground without the will of God." He says this, 
that you may believe that the flesh which has been consigned to the ground, is 
able in like manner to rise again by the will of the same God. For although this 
is not allowed to the sparrows, yet "we are of more value than many sparrows," 
for the very reason that, when fallen, we rise again. He affirms, lastly, that 
"the very hairs of our head are all numbered," and ir the affirmation He of 
course includes the promise of their safety; for if they were to be lost, where 
would be the use of having taken such a numerical care of them? Surely the only 
use lies (in this truth): "That of all which the Father hath given to me, I 
should lose none,"--not even a hair, as also not an eye nor a tooth. And yet 
whence shall come that "weeping and gnashing of teeth," if not from eyes and 
teeth?--even at that time when the body shall be slain in hell, and thrust out 
into that outer darkness which shall be the suitable torment of the eyes. He 
also who shall not be clothed at the marriage feast in the raiment of good 
works, will have to be " bound hand and foot,"--as being, of course, raised in 
his body. So, again, the very reclining at the feast in the kingdom of God, and 
sitting on Christ's thrones, and standing at last on His right hand and His 
left, and eating of the tree of life: what are all these but most certain proofs 
of a bodily appointment and destination? 
CHAP. XXXVI.--CHRIST'S REFUTATION OF THE SADDUCEES, AND AFFIRMATION 
OF CATHOLIC DOCTRINE.
Let us now see whether (the Lord) has not imparted greater strength to our 
doctrine in breaking down the subtle cavil of the Sadducees. Their great object, 
I take it, was to do away altogether with the resurrection, for the Sadducees in 
fact did not admit any salvation either for the soul or the flesh; and 
therefore, taking the strongest case they could for impairing the credibility of 
the resurrection, they adapted an argument from it in support of the question 
which they started. Their specious inquiry concerned the flesh, whether or not 
it would be subject to marriage after the resurrection; and they assumed the 
case of a woman who had married seven brothers, so that it was a doubtful point 
to which of them she should be restored. Now, let the purport both of the 
question and the answer be kept steadily in view, and the discussion is settled 
at once. For since the Sadducees indeed denied the resurrection, whilst the Lord 
affirmed it; since, too, (in affirming it,) He reproached them as being both 
ignorant of the Scriptures--those, of course which had declared the 
resurrection--as well as incredulous of the power of God, though, of course, 
effectual to raise the dead, and lastly, since He immediately added the words, 
"Now, that the dead are raised," (speaking) without misgiving, and affirming the 
very thing which was being denied, even the resurrection of the dead before Him 
who is "the God of the living,"-- (it clearly follows) that He affirmed this 
verity in the precise sense in which they were denying it; that it was, in fact, 
the resurrection of the two natures of man. Nor does it follow, (as they would 
have it,) that because Christ denied that men would marry, He therefore proved 
that they would not rise again. On the contrary, He called them "the children of 
the resurrection," in a certain sense having by the resurrection to undergo a 
birth; and after that they marry no more, but in their risen life are "equal 
unto the angels," inasmuch as they are not to marry, because they are not to 
die, but are destined to pass into the angelic state by putting on the raiment 
of incorruption, although with a change in the substance which is restored to 
life. Besides, no question could be raised whether we are to marry or die again 
or not, without involving in doubt the restoration most especially of that 
substance which has a particular relation both to death and marriage--that is, 
the flesh. Thus, then, you have the Lord affirming against the Jewish heretics 
what is now en 572 
countering the denial of the Christian Sadducees--the resurrection of the 
entire man. 
CHAP. XXXVII.--CHRIST'S ASSERTION ABOUT THE UNPROFITABLENESS OF THE FLESH 
EXPLAINED CONSISTENTLY WITH OUR DOCTRINE.
He says, it is true, that "the flesh profiteth nothing;" but then, as in the 
former case, the meaning must be regulated by the subject which is spoken of. 
Now, because they thought His discourse was harsh and intolerable, supposing 
that He had really and literally enjoined on them to eat his flesh, He, with the 
view of ordering the state of salvation as a spiritual thing, set out with the 
principle, "It is the spirit that quickeneth;" and then added, "The flesh 
profiteth nothing,"--meaning, of course, to the giving of life. He also goes on 
to explain what He would have us to understand by spirit: "The words that I 
speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life." In a like sense He had 
previously said: "He that heareth my words, and believeth on Him that sent me, 
hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but shall pass from 
death unto life." Constituting, therefore, His word as the life-giving 
principle, because that word is spirit and life, He likewise called His flesh by 
the same appelation; because, too, the Word had become flesh, we ought therefore 
to desire Him in order that we may have life, and to devour Him with the ear, 
and to ruminate on Him with the understanding, and to digest Him by faith. Now, 
just before (the passage in hand), He had declared His flesh to be "the bread 
which cometh down from heaven," impressing on (His hearers) constantly under the 
figure of necessary food the memory of their forefathers, who had preferred the 
bread and flesh of Egypt to their divine calling. Then, turning His subject to 
their reflections, because He perceived that they were going to be scattered 
from Him, He says: "The flesh profiteth nothing." Now what is there to destroy 
the resurrection of the flesh? As if there might not reasonably enough be 
something which, although it" profiteth nothing" itself, might yet be capable of 
being profited by something else. The spirit "profiteth," for it imparts life. 
The flesh profiteth nothing, for it is subject to death. Therefore He has rather 
put the two propositions in a way which favours our belief: for by showing what 
"profits," and what "does not profit," He has likewise thrown light on the 
object which receives as well as the subject which gives the "profit." Thus, in 
the present instance, we have the Spirit giving life to the flesh which has been 
subdued by death; for "the hour," says He, "is coming, when the dead shall hear 
the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live." Now, what is "the 
dead" but the flesh? and what is "the voice of God" but the Word? and what is 
the Word but the Spirit, who shall justly raise the flesh which He had once 
Himself become, and that too from death, which He Himself suffered, and from the 
grave, which He Himself once entered? Then again, when He says, "Marvel not at 
this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear the 
voice of the Son of God, and shall come forth; they that have done good, to the 
resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of 
damnation,"--none will after such words be able to interpret the dead "that are 
in the graves" as any other than the bodies of the flesh, because the graves 
themselves are nothing but the resting-place of corpses: for it is incontestable 
that even those who partake of "the old man," that is to say, sinful men--in 
other words, those who are dead through their ignorance of God (whom our 
heretics, forsooth, foolishly insist on understanding by the word "graves")--are 
plainly here spoken of as having to come from their graves for judgment. But how 
are graves to come forth from graves? 
CHAP. XXXVIII.--CHRIST, BY RAISING THE DEAD, ATTESTED IN A PRACTICAL WAY 
THE
DOCTRINE OF THE RESURRECTION OF THE FLESH.
After the Lord's words, what are we to think of the purport of His actions, 
when He raises dead persons from their biers and their graves? To what end did 
He do so? If it was only for the mere exhibition of His power, or to afford the 
temporary favour of restoration to life, it was really no great matter for Him 
to raise men to die over again. If, however, as was the truth, it was rather to 
put in secure keeping men's belief in a future resurrection, then it must follow 
from the particular form of His own examples, that the said resurrection will be 
a bodily one. I can never allow it to be said that the resurrection of the 
future, being destined for the soul only, did then receive these preliminary 
illustrations of a raising of the flesh, simply because it would have been 
impossible to have shown the 573 
resurrection of an invisible soul except by the resuscitation of a visible 
substance. They have but a poor knowledge of God, who suppose Him to be only 
capable of doing what comes within the compass of their own thoughts; and after 
all, they cannot but know full well what His capability has ever been, if they 
only make acquaintance with the writings of John. For unquestionably he, who has 
exhibited to our sight the martyrs' hitherto disembodied souls resting under the 
altar, was quite able to display them before our eyes rising without a body of 
flesh. I, however, for my part prefer (believing) that it is impossible for God 
to practise deception (weak as He only could be in respect of artifice), from 
any fear of seeming to have given preliminary proofs of a thing in a way which 
is inconsistent with His actual disposal of the thing; nay more, from a fear 
that, since He was not powerful enough to show us a sample of the resurrection 
without the flesh, He might with still greater infirmity be unable to display 
(by and by) the full accomplishment of the sample in the self-same substance of 
the flesh. No example, indeed, is greater than the thing of which it is a 
sample. Greater, however, it is, if souls with their body are to be raised as 
the evidence of their resurrection without the body, so as that the entire 
salvation of man in saul and body should become a guarantee for only the half, 
the soul; whereas the condition in all examples is, that which would be deemed 
the less--I mean the resurrection of the soul only--should be the foretaste, as 
it were, of the rising of the flesh also at its appointed time. And therefore, 
according to our estimate of the truth, those examples of dead persons who were 
raised by the Lord were indeed a proof of the resurrection both of the flesh and 
of the soul,--a proof, in fact, that this gift was to be denied to neither 
substance. Considered, however, as examples only, they expressed all the less 
significance--less, indeed, than Christ will express at last--for they were not 
raised up for glory and immortality, but only for another death. 
CHAP. XXXIX.--ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE AFFORDED TO US IN THE ACTS OF THE 
APOSTLES.
The Acts of the Apostles, too, attest the resurrection. Now the apostles had 
nothing else to do, at least among the Jews, than to-explain the Old Testament 
and confirm the New, and above all, to preach God in Christ. Consequently they 
introduced nothing new concerning the resurrection, besides announcing it to the 
glory of Christ: in every other respect it had been already received in simple 
and intelligent faith, without any question as to what sort of resurrection it 
was to be, and without encountering any other opponents than the Sadducees. So 
much easier was it to deny the resurrection altogether, than to understand it in 
an alien sense. You find Paul confessing his faith before the chief priests, 
under the shelter of the chief captain, 
among the Sadducees and the Pharisees: "Men and brethren," he says, "I am a 
Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am 
now called in question by you,"--referring, of course, to the nation's hope; in 
order to avoid, in his present condition, as an apparent transgressor of the 
law, being thought to approach to the Sadducees in opinion on the most important 
article of the faith--even the resurrection. That belief, therefore, in the 
resurrection which he would not appear to impair, he really confirmed in the 
opinion of the Pharisees, since he rejected the views of the Sadducees, who 
denied it. In like manner, before Agrippa also, he says that he was advancing 
"none other things than those which the prophets had announced." 
He was therefore maintaining just such a resurrection as the prophets had 
foretold. He mentions also what is written by "Moses ", touching the 
resurrection of the dead; (and in so doing) he must have known that it would be 
a rising in the body, since requisition will have to be made therein of the 
blood of man. He declared it then to be of such a character as the Pharisees had 
admitted it, and such as the Lord had Himself maintained it, and such too as the 
Sadducees refused to believe it--such refusal leading them indeed to an absolute 
rejection of the whole verity. Nor had the Athenians previously understood Paul 
to announce any other resurrection. They had, in fact, derided his announcement; 
but they would have indulged no such derision if they had heard from him nothing 
but the restoration of the soul, for they would have received that as the very 
common anticipation of their own native philosophy. But when the preaching of 
the resurrection, of which they had previously not heard, by its absolute 
novelty excited the heathen, and a not unnatural incredulity in so wonderful a 
matter began to harass the simple faith with many discussions, then the apostle 
took care in almost every one of his writings to strengthen men's belief of 574 
this Christian hope, pointing out that there was such a hope, and that it had 
not as yet been realized, and that it would be in the body,--a point which was 
the especial object of inquiry, and, what was besides a doubtful question, not 
in a body of a different kind from ours. 
CHAP, XL.--SUNDRY PASSAGES OF ST. PAUL WHICH ATTEST OUR DOCTRINE RESCUED 
FROM THE PERVERSIONS OF HERESY.
Now it is no matter of surprise if arguments are captiously taken from the 
writings of (the apostle) himself, inasmuch as there "must needs be heresies;" 
but these could not be, if the Scriptures were not capable of a false 
interpretation. Well, then, heresies finding that the apostle had mentioned two 
"men"--"the inner man," that is, the soul, and "the outward man," that is, the 
flesh--awarded salvation to the soul or inward man, and destruction to the flesh 
or outward man, because it is written (in the Epistle) to the Corinthians: 
"Though our outward man decayeth, yet the inward man is renewed day by day." 
Now, neither the soul by itself alone is "man" (it was subsequently implanted in 
the clayey mould to which the name man had been already given), nor is the flesh 
without the soul " man ": for after the exile of the soul from it, it has the 
title of corpse. Thus the designation man is, in a certain sense, the bond 
between the two closely united substances, under which designation they cannot 
but be coherent natures. As for the inward man, indeed, the apostle prefers its 
being regarded as the mind and heart rather than the soul; in other words, not 
so much the substance itself as the savour of the substance. Thus when, writing 
to the Ephesians, he spoke of "Christ dwelling in their inner man," he meant, no 
doubt, that the Lord ought to be admitted into their senses. He then added, "in 
your hearts by faith, rooted and grounded in love,"--making "faith" and "love" 
not substantial parts, but only conceptions of the soul. But when he used the 
phrase "in your hearts," seeing that these are substantial parts of the flesh, 
he at once assigned to the flesh the actual "inward man," which he placed in the 
heart. Consider now in what sense he alleged that "the outward man decayeth, 
while the inward man is renewed day by day." You certainly would not maintain 
that he could mean that corruption of the flesh which it undergoes from the 
moment of death, in its appointed state of perpetual decay; but the wear and 
tear which for the name of Christ it experiences during its course of life 
before and until death, in harassing cares and tribulations as well as in 
tortures and persecutions. Now the inward man will have, of course, to be 
renewed by the suggestion of the Spirit, advancing by faith and holiness day 
after day, here in this life, not there after the resurrection, were our renewal 
is not a gradual process from day to day, but a consummation once for all 
complete. You may learn this, too, from the following passage, where the apostle 
says: "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for as a far 
more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things 
which are seen," that is, our sufferings, "but at the things which are not 
seen," that is, our rewards: "for the things which are seen are temporal, but 
the things which are not seen are eternal." For the afflictions and injuries 
wherewith the outward man is worn away, he affirms to be only worthy of being 
despised by us, as being light and temporary; preferring those eternal 
recompenses which are also invisible, and that "weight of glory" which will be a 
counterpoise for the labours in the endurance of which the flesh here suffers 
decay. So that the subject in this passage is not that corruption which they 
ascribe to the outward man in the utter destruction of the flesh, with the view 
of nullifying the resurrection. So also he says elsewhere: "If so be that we 
suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified together; for I reckon that the 
sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that 
shall be revealed in us." Here again he shows us that our sufferings are less 
than their rewards. Now, since it is through the flesh that we suffer with 
Christ--for it is the property of the flesh to be worn by sufferings--to the 
same flesh belongs the recompense which is promised for suffering with Christ. 
Accordingly, when he is going to assign afflictions to the flesh as its especial 
liability--according to the statement he had already made--he says, "When we 
were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest;" then, in order to make the 
soul a fellow-sufferer with the body, he adds, "We were troubled on every side; 
without were fightings," which of course warred down the flesh, "within were 
fears," which afflicted the soul. Although, therefore, the outward man 
decays--not in the sense of missing the resurrection, but of enduring 
tribulation--it will be under 575 
stood from this scripture that it is not exposed to its suffering without the 
inward man. Both therefore, will be glorified together, even as they have 
suffered together. Parallel with their participation in troubles, must 
necessarily run their association also in rewards. 
CHAP. XLI.--THE DISSOLUTION OF OUR TABERNACLE CONSISTENT WITH THE 
RESURRECTION OF OUR BODIES.
It is still the same sentiment which he follows up in the passage in which he 
puts the recompense above the sufferings: "for we know;" he says, "that if our 
earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a house not made with 
hands, eternal in the heavens;" in other words, owing to the fact that our flesh 
is undergoing dissolution through its sufferings, we shall be provided with a 
home in heaven. He remembered the award (which the Lord assigns) in the Gospel: 
"Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the 
kingdom of heaven." Yet, when he thus contrasted the recompense of the reward, 
he did not deny the flesh's restoration; since the recompense is due to the same 
substance to which the dissolution is attributed,--that is, of course, the 
flesh. Because, however, he had called the flesh a horse, he wished elegantly to 
use the same term in his comparison of the ultimate reward; promising to the 
very house, which undergoes dissolution through suffering, a better house 
through the resurrection. Just as the Lore also promises us many mansions as of 
a house in His Father's home; although this may possibly be understood of the 
domicile of this world, on the dissolution of whose fabric an eternal abode is 
promised in heaven, inasmuch as the following context, having a manifest 
reference to the flesh, seems to show that these preceding words have no such 
reference. For the apostle makes a distinction, when he goes on to say, "For in 
this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is 
from heaven, if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked;" which 
means, before we put off the garment of the flesh, we wish to be clothed with 
the celestial glory of immortality. Now the privilege of this favour awaits 
those who shall at the coming of the Lord be found in the flesh, and who shall, 
owing to the oppressions of the time of Antichrist, deserve by an instantaneous 
death, which is accomplished by a sudden change, to become qualified to join the 
rising saints; as he writes to the Thessalonians: "For this we say unto you by 
the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the 
Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. 
For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice 
of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise 
first: then we too shall ourselves be caught up together with them in the 
clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord." 
CHAP. XLII.--DEATH CHANGES, WITHOUT DESTROYING, OUR MORTAL BODIES. REMAINS 
OF THE GIANTS.
It is the transformation these shall undergo which he explains to the 
Corinthians, when he writes: "We shall all indeed rise again (though we shall 
not all undergo the transformation) in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at 
the last trump "--for none shall experience this change but those only who shall 
be found in the flesh. "And the dead," he says, "shall be raised, and we shall 
be changed." Now, after a careful consideration of this appointed order, you 
will be able to adjust what follows to the preceding sense. For when he adds, 
"This corruptible must put on incorrruption, and this mortal must put on 
immortality," this will assuredly be that house from heaven, with which we so 
earnestly desire to be clothed upon, whilst groaning in this our present 
body,--meaning, of course, over this flesh in which we shall be surprised at 
last; because he says that we are burdened whilst in this tabernacle, which we 
do not wish indeed to be stripped of, but rather to be in it clothed over, in 
such a way that mortality may be swallowed up of life, that is, by putting on 
over us whilst we are transformed that vestiture which is from heaven. For who 
is there that will not desire, while he is in the flesh, to put on immortality, 
and to continue his life by a happy escape from death, through the 
transformation which must be experienced instead of it, without encountering too 
that Hades which will exact the very last farthing? Nothwithstanding, he who has 
already traversed Hades is destined also to obtain the change after the 
resurrection. For from this circumstance it is that we definitively declare that 
the flesh will by all means rise again, and, from the change that is to come 
over it, will assume the condition of angels. Now, if it were merely in the case 
of those who shall be found in the flesh that the 576 
change must be undergone, in order that mortality may be swallowed up of 
life--in other words, that the flesh (be covered) with the heavenly and eternal 
raiment--it would either follow that those who shall be found in death would not 
obtain life, deprived as they would then be of the material and so to say the 
aliment of life, that is, the flesh; or else, these also must needs undergo the 
change, that in them too mortality may be swallowed up of life, since it is 
appointed that they too should obtain life. But, you say, in the case of the 
dead, mortality is already swallowed up of life. No, not in all cases, 
certainly. For how many will most probably be found of men who had just died--so 
recently put into their graves, that nothing in them would seem to be decayed? 
For you do not of course deem a thing to be decayed unless it be cut off, 
abolished, and withdrawn from our perception, as having in every possible way 
ceased to be apparent. There are the carcases of the giants of old time; it will 
be obvious enough that they are not absolutely decayed, for their bony frames 
are still extant. We have already spoken of this elsewhere. For instance, even 
lately in this very city, when they were sacrilegiously laying the foundations 
of the Odeum on a good many ancient graves, people were horror-stricken to 
discover, after some five hundred years, bones, which still retained their 
moisture, and hair which had not lost its perfume. It is certain not only that 
bones remain indurated, but also that teeth continue undecayed for ages--both of 
them the lasting germs of that body which is to sprout into life again in the 
resurrection. Lastly, even if everything that is mortal in all the dead shall 
then be found decayed--at any rate consumed by death, by time, and through 
age,--is there nothing which will be "swallowed up of life," nor by being 
covered over and arrayed in the vesture of immortality? Now, he who says that 
mortality is going to be swallowed up of life has already admitted that what is 
dead is not destroyed by those other before-mentioned devourers. And verily it 
will be extremely fit that all shall be consummated and brought about by the 
operations of God, and not by the laws of nature. Therefore, inasmuch as what is 
mortal has to be swallowed up of life, it must needs be brought out to view in 
order to be so swallowed up; (needful) also to be swallowed up, in order to 
undergo the ultimate transformation. If you were to say that a fire is to be 
lighted, you could not possibly allege that what is to kindle it is sometimes 
necessary and sometimes not. In like manner, when he inserts the words "If so be 
that being unclothed we be not found naked."--refering, of course, to those who 
shall not be found in the day of the Lord alive and in the flesh--he did not say 
that they whom he had just described as unclothed or stripped, were naked in any 
other sense than meaning that they should be understood to be reinvested with 
the very same substance they had been divested of. For although they shall be 
found naked when their flesh has been laid aside, or to some extent sundered or 
worn away (and this condition may well be called nakedness,) they shall 
afterwards recover it again, in order that, being reinvested with the flesh, 
they may be able also to have put over that the supervestment of immortality; 
for it will be impossible for the outside garment to fit except over one who is 
already dressed. 
CHAP. XLIII.--NO DISPARAGEMENT OF OUR DOCTRINE IN ST. PAUL'S PHRASE, WHICH 
CALLS OUR RESIDENCE IN THE FLESH ABSENCE FROM THE LORD.
In the same way, when he says, "Therefore we are always confident, and fully 
aware, that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord; for we 
walk by faith, not be sight,'' it is manifest that in this statement there is no 
design of disparaging the flesh, as if it separated us from the Lord. For there 
is here pointedly addressed to us an exhortation to disregard this present life, 
since we are absent from the Lord as long as we are passing through it--walking 
by faith, not by sight; in other words, in hope, not in reality. Accordingly he 
adds: "We are indeed confident and deem it good rather to be absent from the 
body, and present with the Lord;'' in order, that is, that we may walk by sight 
rather than by faith, in realization rather than in hope. Observe how he here 
also ascribes to the excellence of martyrdom a contempt for the body. For no 
one, on becoming absent from the body, is at once a dweller in the presence of 
the Lord, except by the prerogative of martyrdom, he gains a lodging in 
Paradise, not in the lower regions. Now, had the apostle been at a loss for 
words to describe the departure from the body? Or does he purposely use a novel 
phraseology? For, wanting to express our temporary absence 577 
from the body, he says that we are strangers, absent from it, because a man 
who goes abroad returns after a while to his home. Then he says even to all: "We 
therefore earnestly desire to be acceptable unto God, whether absent or present; 
for we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ Jesus." If all of us, 
then all of us wholly; if wholly, then our inward man and outward too--that is, 
our bodies no less than our souls. "That every one," as he goes on to say, "may 
receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it 
be good or bad." Now I ask, how do you read this passage? Do you take it to be 
confusedly constructed, with a transposition of ideas? Is the question about 
what things will have to be received by the body, or the things which have been 
already done in the body? Well, if the things which are to be borne by the body 
are meant, then undoubtedly a resurrection of the body is implied; and if the 
things which have been already done in the body are referred to, (the same 
conclusion follows): for of course the retribution will have to be paid by the 
body, since it was by the body that the actions were performed. Thus the 
apostle's whole argument from the beginning is unravelled in this concluding 
clause, wherein the resurrection of the flesh is set forth; and it ought to be 
understood in a sense which is strictly in accordance with this conclusion. 
CHAP. XLIV.--SUNDRY OTHER PASSAGES OF ST. PAUL EXPLAINED IN A SENTENCE
CONFIRMATORY OF OUR DOCTRINE.
Now, if you will examine the words which precede the passage where mention is 
made of the outward and the inward man, will you not discover the whole truth, 
both of the dignity and the hope of the flesh? For, when he speaks of the "light 
which God hath commanded to shine in our hearts, to give the light of the 
knowledge of the glory of the Lord in the person of Jesus Christ," and says that 
"we have this treasure in earthen vessels," meaning of course the flesh, which 
is meant--that the flesh shall be destroyed, because it is "an earthen vessel," 
deriving its origin from clay; or that it is to be glorified, as being the 
receptacle of a divine treasure? Now if that true light, which is in the person 
of Christ, contains in itself life, and that life with its light is committed to 
the flesh, is that destined to perish which has life entrusted to it? Then, of 
course, the treasure will perish also; for perishable things are entrusted to 
things which are themselves perishable, which is like putting new wine into old 
bottles. When also he adds, "Always bearing about in our body the dying of the 
Lord Jesus Christ" what sort of substance is that which, after (being called) 
the temple of God, can now be also designated the tomb of Christ? But why do we 
bear about in the body the dying of the Lord? In order, as he says, "that His 
life also may be manifested." Where? "In the body." In what body? "In our mortal 
body." Therefore in the flesh, which is mortal indeed through sin, but living 
through grace--how great a grace you may see when the purpose is, "that the life 
of Christ may be manifested in it." Is it then in a thing which is a stranger to 
salvation, in a substance which is perpetually dissolved, that the life of 
Christ will be manifested, which is eternal, continuous, incorruptible, and 
already the life of God? Else to what epoch belongs that life of the Lord which 
is to be manifested in our body? It surely is the life which He lived up to His 
passion, which was not only openly shown among the Jews, but has now been 
displayed even to all nations. Therefore that life is meant which" has broken 
the adamantine gates of death and the brazen bars of the lower world,"--a life 
which thenceforth has been and will be ours. Lastly, it is to be manifested in 
the body. When? After death. How? By rising in our body, as Christ also rose in 
His. But lest any one should here object, that the life of Jesus has even now to 
be manifested in our body by the discipline of holiness, and patience, and 
righteouness, and wisdom, in which the Lord's life abounded, the most provident 
wisdom of the apostle inserts this purpose: "For we which live are alway 
delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that His life may be manifested in our 
mortal body." In us, therefore, even when dead, does he say that this is to take 
place in us. And if so, how is this possible except in our body after its 
resurrection? 
Therefore he adds in the concluding sentence: "Knowing that He which raised 
up the Lord Jesus, shall raise up us also with Him," risen as He is already from 
the dead. But perhaps "with Him" means "like Him:" well then, if it be like Him, 
it is not of course without the flesh.

CHAP. XLV.--THE OLD MAN AND THE NEW MAN
OF ST. PAUL EXPLAINED.
But in their blindness they again impale themselves on the point of the old 
and the new man. When the apostle enjoins us "to put off the old man, which is 
corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and to be renewed in the spirit of our 
mind; and to put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and 
true holiness," (they maintain) that by here also making a distinction between 
the two substances, and applying the old one to the flesh and the new one to the 
spirit, he ascribes to the old man--that is to say, the flesh--a permanent 
corruption. Now, if you follow the order of the substances, the soul cannot be 
the new man because it comes the later of the two; nor can the flesh be the old 
man because it is the former. For what fraction of time was it that intervened 
between the creative hand of God and His afflatus? I will venture to say, that 
even if the soul was a good deal prior to the flesh, by the very circumstance 
that the soul had to wait to be itself completed, it made the other really the 
former. For everything which gives the finishing stroke and perfection to a 
work, although it is subsequent in its mere order, yet has the priority in its 
effect. Much more is that prior, without which preceding things could have no 
existence. If the flesh be the old man, when did it become so? From the 
beginning? But Adam was wholly a new man, and of that new man there could be no 
part an old man. And from that time, ever since the blessing which was 
pronounced upon man's generation, the flesh and the soul have had a simultaneous 
birth, without any calcuable difference in time; so that the two have been even 
generated together in the womb, as we have shown in our Treatise an the Saul. 
Contemporaneous in the womb, they are also temporally identical in their birth. 
The two are no doubt produced by human parents of two substances, but not at two 
different periods; rather they are so entirely one, that neither is before the 
other in paint of time. It is more correct (to say), that we are either entirely 
the old man or entirely the new, for we cannot tell how we can possibly be 
anything else. But the apostle mentions a very clear mark of the old man. For 
"put off," says he, "concerning the former conversation, the old man; " (he 
does) not say concerning the seniority of either substance. It is not indeed the 
flesh which he bids us to put off, but the works which he in another passage 
shows to be "works of the flesh." He brings no accusation against men's bodies, 
of which he even writes as follows: "Putting away lying, speak every man truth 
with his neighbor: for we are members one of another. Be ye angry, and sin not: 
let not the sun go down upon your wrath: neither give place to the devil. Let 
him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands 
(the thing which is good), that he may have to give to him that needeth. Let no 
corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good for the 
edification of faith, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. And grieve 
not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. 
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, be put 
away from you, with all malice: but be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, 
forgiving one another, even as God in Christ hath forgiven you.'' Why, 
therefore, do not those who suppose the flesh to be the old man, hasten their 
own death, in order that by laying aside the old man they may satisfy the 
apostle's precepts? As for ourselves, we believe that the whole of faith is to 
be administered in the flesh, nay more, by the flesh, which has both a mouth for 
the utterance of all holy words, and a tongue to refrain from blasphemy, and a 
heart to avoid all irritation, and hands to labour and to give; while we also 
maintain that as well the old man as the new has relation to the difference of 
moral conduct, and not to any discrepancy of nature. And just as we acknowledge 
that that which according to its former conversation was "the old man" was also 
corrupt, and received its very name in accordance with "its deceitful lusts," so 
also (do we hold) that it is "the old man in reference to its former 
conversation," and not in respect of the flesh through any permanent 
dissolution. Moreover, it is still unimpaired in the flesh, and identical in 
that nature, even when it has become "the new man;" since it is of its sinful 
course of life, and not of its corporeal substance, that it has been divested. 
CHAP. XLVI.--IT IS THE WORKS OF THE FLESH, NOT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE FLESH, 
WHICH ST. PAUL ALWAYS CONDEMNS.
You may notice that the apostle everywhere condemns the works of the flesh in 
such a 579 
way as to appear to condemn the flesh; but no one can suppose him to have any 
such view as this, since he goes on to suggest another sense, even though 
somewhat resembling it. For when he actually declares that "they who are in the 
flesh cannot please God," he immediately recalls the statement from an heretical 
sense to a sound one, by adding, "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the 
Spirit.'' Now, by denying them to be in the flesh who yet obviously were in the 
flesh, he showed that they were not living amidst the works of the flesh, and 
therefore that they who could not please God were not those who were in the 
flesh, but only those who were living after the flesh; whereas they pleased God, 
who, although existing in the flesh, were yet walking after the Spirit. And, 
again, he says that "the body is dead;" but it is "because of sin," even as "the 
Spirit is life because of righteousness." When, however, he thus sets life in 
opposition to the death which is constituted in the flesh, he unquestionably 
promises the life of righteousness to the same state for which he determined the 
death of sin, But unmeaning is this opposition which he makes between the "life" 
and the "death," if the life is not there where that very thing is to which he 
opposes it--even the death which is to be extirpated of course from the body. 
Now, if life thus extirpates death from the body, it can accomplish this only by 
penetrating thither where that is which it is excluding. But why am I resorting 
to knotty arguments, when the apostle treats the subject with perfect plainness? 
"For if," says he, "the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell 
in you, He that raised up Jesus from the dead shall also quicken your mortal 
bodies, because of His Spirit that dwelleth in you;" so that even if a person 
were to assume that the soul is "the mortal body," he would (since he cannot 
possibly deny that the flesh is this also) be constrained to acknowledge a 
restoration even of the flesh, in consequence of its participation in the 
selfsame state. From the following words, moreover, you may learn that it is the 
works of the flesh which are condemned, and not the flesh itself: "Therefore, 
brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: for if ye 
live after the flesh ye shall die; but if ye, through the Spirit, do mortify the 
deeds of the body, ye shall live." Now (that I may answer each point 
separately), since salvation is promised to those who are living in the flesh, 
but walking after the Spirit, it is no longer the flesh which is an adversary to 
salvation, but the working of the flesh. When, however, this operativeness of 
the flesh is done away with, which is the cause of death, the flesh is shown to 
be safe, since it is freed from the cause of death. "For the law," says he, "of 
the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and 
death,"--that, surely, which he previously mentioned as dwelling in our members. 
Our members, therefore, will no longer be subject to the law of death, because 
they cease to serve that of sin, from both which they have been set free. "For 
what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending 
His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and through sin condemned sin in 
the flesh "--not the flesh in sin, for the house is not to be condemned with its 
inhabitant. He said, indeed, that "sin dwelleth in our body." But the 
condemnation of sin is the acquittal of the flesh, just as its non-condemnation 
subjugates it to the law of sin and death. In like manner, he called "the carnal 
mind" first "death," and afterwards "enmity against God;" but he never 
predicated this of the flesh itself. But to what then, you will say, must the 
carnal mind be ascribed, if it be not to the carnal substance itself? I will 
allow your objection, if you will prove to me that the flesh has any discernment 
of its own. If, however, it has no conception of anything without the soul, you 
must understand that the carnal mind must be referred to the soul, although 
ascribed sometimes to the flesh, on the ground that it is ministered to for the 
flesh and through the flesh. And therefore (the apostle) says that "sin dwelleth 
in the flesh," because the soul by which sin is provoked has its temporary 
lodging in the flesh, which is doomed indeed to death, not however on its own 
account, but on account of sin. For he says in another passage also "How is it 
that you conduct yourselves as if you were even now living in the world?" where 
he is not writing to dead persons, but to those who ought to have ceased to live 
after the ways of the world CHAP.XLVII.--ST. PAUL, ALL THROUGH, PROMISES 
ETERNAL LIFE TO THE BODY.
For that must be living after the world, 580 
which, as the old man, he declares to be " crucified with Christ," not as a 
bodily structure, but as moral behaviour. Besides, if we do not understand it in 
this sense, it is not our bodily frame which has been transfixed (at all 
events), nor has our flesh endured the cross of Christ; but the sense is that 
which he has subjoined, "that the body of sin might be made void,'' by an 
amendment of life, not by a destruction of the substance, as he goes on to say, 
"that henceforth we should not serve sin; " and that we should believe ourselves 
to be "dead with Christ," in such a manner as that "we shall also live with 
Him.'' On the same principle he says: "Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be 
dead indeed.'' To what? To the flesh? No, but "unto sin." Accordingly as to the 
flesh they will be saved--" alive unto God in Christ Jesus," through the flesh 
of course, to which they will not be dead; since it is "unto sin," and not to 
the flesh, that they are dead. For he pursues the point still further: "Let not 
sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it, and that ye 
should yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield 
ye yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead "--not simply 
alive, but as alive from the dead--" and your members as instruments of 
righteousness." And again: "As ye have yielded your members servants of 
uncleanness, and of iniquity unto iniquity, even so now yield your members 
servants of righteousness unto holiness; for whilst ye were the servants of sin, 
ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then in those things of which 
ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now, being made 
free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and 
the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is 
eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Thus throughout this series of 
passages, whilst withdrawing our members from unrighteousness and sin, and 
applying them to righteousness and holiness, and transferring the same from the 
wages of death to the donative of eternal life, he undoubtedly promises to the 
flesh the recompense of salvation. Now it would not at all have been consistent 
that any rule of holiness and righteousness should be especially enjoined for 
the flesh, if the reward of such a discipline were not also within its reach; 
nor could even baptism be properly ordered for the flesh, if by its regeneration 
a course were not inaugurated tending to its restitution; the apostle himself 
suggesting this idea: "Know ye not, that so many of us as are baptized into 
Jesus Christ, are baptized into His death? We are therefore buried with Him by 
baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised up from the dead, even so we 
also should walk in newness of life." And that you may not suppose that this is 
said merely of that life which we have to walk in the newness of, through 
baptism, by faith, the apostle with superlative forethought adds: " For if we 
have been planted together in the likeness of Christ's death, we shall be also 
in the likeness of His resurrection." By a figure we die in our baptism, but in 
a reality we rise again in the flesh, even as Christ did, "that, as sin has 
reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto life 
eternal, through Jesus Christ our Lord.'' But how so, unless equally in the 
flesh? For where the death is, there too must be the life after the death, 
because also the life was first there, where the death subsequently was. Now, if 
the dominion of death operates only in the dissolution of the flesh, in like 
manner death's contrary, life, ought to produce the contrary effect, even the 
restoration of the flesh; so that, just as death had swallowed it up in its 
strength, it also, after this mortal was swallowed up of immortality, may hear 
the challenge pronounced against it: "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, 
where is thy victory?" For in this way "grace shall there much more abound, 
where sin once abounded." In this way also "shall strength be made perfect in 
weakness,"--saving what is lost, reviving what is dead, healing what is 
stricken, curing what is faint, redeeming what is lost, freeing what is 
enslaved, recalling what has strayed, raising what is fallen; and this from 
earth to heaven, where, as the apostle teaches the Philippians, "we have our 
citizenship, from whence also we look for our Saviour Jesus Christ, who shall 
change our body of humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious 
body"--of course after the resurrection, because Christ Himself was not 
glorified before He suffered. These must be "the bodies" which he "beseeches" 
the Romans 581 
to "present" as "a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God." But how a 
living sacrifice, if these bodies are to perish? How a holy one, if they are 
profanely soiled? How acceptable to God, if they are condemned? Come, now, tell 
me how that passage (in the Epistle) to the Thessalonians--which, because of its 
clearness, I should suppose to have been written with a sunbeam--is understood 
by our heretics, who shun the light of Scripture: "And the very God of peace 
sanctify you wholly." And as if this were not plain enough, it goes on to say: 
"And may your whole body, and soul, and spirit be preserved blameless unto the 
coming of the Lord." Here you have the entire substance of man destined to 
salvation, and that at no other time than at the coming of the Lord, which is 
the key of the resurrection. 
CHAP. XLVIII.--SUNDRY PASSAGES IN THE GREAT CHAPTER OF THE RESURRECTION OF 
THE DEAD EXPLAINED IN DEFENCE OF OUR DOCTRINE.
But "flesh and blood," you say, "cannot inherit the kingdom of God." We are 
quite aware that this too is written; but although our opponents place it in the 
front of the battle, we have intentionally reserved the objection until now, in 
order that we may in our last assault overthrow it, after we have removed out of 
the way all the questions which are auxiliary to it. However, they must contrive 
to recall to their mind even now our preceding arguments, in order that the 
occasion which originally suggested this passage may assist our judgment in 
arriving at its meaning. The apostle, as I take it, having set forth for the 
Corinthians the details of their church discipline, had summed up the substance 
of his own gospel, and of their belief in an exposition of the Lord's death and 
resurrection, for the purpose of deducing therefrom the rule of our hope, and 
the groundwork thereof. Accordingly he subjoins this statement: "Now if Christ 
be preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no 
resurrection of the dead? If there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ 
is not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your 
faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we 
have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He raised not up, if so be 
that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and 
if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain, because ye are yet in your sins, 
and they which have fallen asleep in Christ are perished." Now, what is the 
point which he evidently labours hard to make us believe throughout this 
passage? The resurrection of the dead, you say, which was denied: he certainly 
wished it to be believed on the strength of the example which he adduced--the 
Lord's resurrection. Certainly, you say. Well now, is an example borrowed from 
different circumstances, or from like ones? From like ones, by all means, is 
your answer. How then did Christ rise again? In the flesh, or not? No doubt, 
since you are told that He "died according to the Scriptures," and "that He was 
buried according to the Scriptures," no otherwise than in the flesh, you will 
also allow that it was in the flesh that He was raised from the dead. 
For the very same body which fell in death, and which lay in the sepulchre, 
did also rise again; (and it was) not so much Christ in the flesh, as the flesh 
in Christ. If, therefore, we are to rise again after the example of Christ, who 
rose in the flesh, we shall certainly not rise according to that example, unless 
we also shall ourselves rise again in the flesh. "For," he says, "since by man 
came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead." (This he says) in 
order, on the one hand, to distinguish the two authors--Adam of death, Christ of 
resurrection; and, on the other hand, to make the resurrection operate on the 
same substance as the death, by comparing the authors themselves under the 
designation man. For if "as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made 
alive," their vivification in Christ must be in the flesh, since it is in the 
flesh that arises their death in Adam. "But every man in his own order," because 
of course it will be also every man in his own body. For the order will be 
arranged severally, on account of the individual merits. Now, as the merits must 
be ascribed to the body, it must needs follow that the order also should be 
arranged in respect of the bodies, that it may be in relation to their merits. 
But inasmuch as "some are also baptized for the dead," we will see whether there 
be a good reason for this. Now it is certain that they adopted this (practice) 
with such a presumption as made them suppose that the vicarious baptism (in 
question) would be beneficial to the flesh of another in anticipation of the 
resurrection; for unless it were a bodily resur 582 
rection, there would be no pledge secured by this process of a corporeal 
baptism. "Why are they then baptized for the dead,'' he asks, unless the bodies 
rise again which are thus baptized? For it is not the soul which is sanctified 
by the baptismal bath: its sanctification comes from the "answer." "And why," he 
inquires, "stand we in jeopardy every hour?"--meaning, of course, through the 
flesh. "I die daily," (says he); that is, undoubtedly, in the perils of the 
body, in which "he even fought with beasts at Ephesus,"--even with those beasts 
which caused him such peril and trouble in Asia, to which he alludes in his 
second epistle to the same church of Corinth: "For we would not, brethren, have 
you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed above 
measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life." Now, if I 
mistake not, he enumerates all these particulars in order that in his 
unwillingness to have his conflicts in the flesh supposed to be useless, he may 
induce an unfaltering belief in the resurrection of the flesh. For useless must 
that conflict be deemed (which is sustained in a body) for which no resurrection 
is in prospect. "But some man will say, How are the dead to be raised? And with 
what body will they come?" Now here he discusses the qualities of bodies, 
whether it be the very same, or different ones, which men are to resume. 
Since, however, such a question as this must be regarded as a subsequent one, 
it will in passing be enough for us that the resurrection is determined to be a 
bodily one even from this, that it is about the quality of bodies that the 
inquiry arises. 
CHAP. XLIX.--THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED. WHAT DOES THE APOSTLE EXCLUDE 
FROM THE DEAD? CERTAINLY NOT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE FLESH.
We come now to the very gist of the whole question: What are the substances, 
and of what nature are they, which the apostle has disinherited of the kingdom 
of God? The t preceding statements give us a clue to this t point also. He says: 
"The first man is of i the earth, earthy "--that is, made of dust, that is, 
Adam; " the second man is from heaven"--that is, the Word of God, which is 
Christ, in no other way, however, man (although "from heaven "), than as being 
Himself flesh and soul, just as a human being is, just as Adam was. Indeed, in a 
previous passage He is called "the second Adam, " deriving the identity of His 
name from His participation in the substance, because not even Adam was flesh of 
human seed, in which Christ is also like Him. "As is the earthy, such are they 
also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are 
heavenly." Such (does he mean), in substance; or first of all in training, and 
afterwards in the dignity and worth which that training aimed at acquiring? Not 
in substance, however, by any means will the earthy and the heavenly be 
separated, designated as they have been by the apostle once for all, as men. For 
even if Christ were the only true "heavenly," nay, super-celestial Being, He is 
still man, as composed of body and soul; and in no respect is He separated from 
the quality of "earthiness," owing to that condition of His which makes Him a 
partaker of both substances. In like manner, those also who after Him are 
heavenly, are understood to have this celestial quality predicated of them not 
from their present nature, but from their future glory; because in a preceding 
sentence, which originated this distinction respecting difference of dignity, 
there was shown to be "one glory in celestial bodies, and another in terrestrial 
ones,"--"one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory 
of the stars: for even one star differeth from another star in glory, " although 
not in substance. Then, after having thus premised the difference in that worth 
or dignity which is even now to be aimed at, and then at last to be enjoyed, the 
apostle adds an exhortation, that we should both here in our training follow the 
example of Christ, and there attain His eminence in glory: "As we have borne the 
image of the earthy, let us also bear the image of the heavenly." We have indeed 
borne the image of the earthy, by our sharing in his trangression, by our 
participation in his death, by our banishment from Paradise. Now, although the 
image of Adam is here borne by s in the flesh, yet we are not exhorted to put 
off the flesh; but if not the flesh, it is the conversation, in order that we 
may then bear the image of the heavenly in ourselves,--no longer indeed the 
image of God, and no longer the image of a Being whose state is in heaven; but 
after the lineaments of Christ, by our walking here in holiness, righteousness, 
and 583 
truth. And so wholly intent on the inculcation of moral conduct is he 
throughout. this passage, that he tells us we ought to bear the image of Christ 
in this flesh of ours, and in this period of instruction and discipline. For 
when he says "let us bear" in the imperative mood, he suits his words to the 
present life, in which man exists in no other substance than as flesh and soul; 
or if it is another, even the heavenly, substance to which this faith (of ours) 
looks forward, yet the promise is made to that substance to which the injunction 
is given to labour earnestly to merit its reward. Since, therefore, he makes the 
image both of the earthy and the heavenly consist of moral conduct--the one to 
be abjured, and the other to be pursued--and then consistently adds, "For this I 
say" (on account, that is, of what I have already said, because the conjunction 
"for" connects what follows with the preceding words) "that flesh and blood 
cannot inherit the kingdom of God,"--he means the flesh and blood to be 
understood in no other sense than the before-mentioned "image of the earthy;" 
and since this is reckoned to consist in "the old conversation," which old 
conversation receives not the kingdom of God, therefore flesh and blood, by not 
receiving the kingdom of God, are reduced to the life of the old conversation. 
Of course, as the apostle has never put the substance for the works of man, he 
cannot use such a construction here. Since, however he has declared of men which 
are yet alive in the flesh, that they "are not in the flesh," meaning that they 
are not living in the works of the flesh, you ought not to subvert its form nor 
its substance, but only the works done in the substance (of the flesh), 
alienating us from the kingdom of God. It is after displaying to the Galatians 
these pernicious works that he professes to warn them beforehand, even as he had 
"told them in time past, that they which do such things should not inherit the 
kingdom of God," even because they bore not the image of the heavenly, as they 
had borne the image of the earthy; and so, in consequence of their old 
conversation, they were to be regarded as nothing else than flesh and blood. But 
even if the apostle had abruptly thrown out the sentence that flesh and blood 
must be excluded from the kingdom of God, without any previous intimation, of 
his meaning, would it not have been equally our duty to interpret these two 
substances as the old man abandoned to mere flesh and blood--in other words, to 
eating and drinking, one feature of which would be to speak against the faith of 
the resurrection: "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die." Now, when the 
apostle parenthetically inserted this, he censured flesh and blood because of 
their enjoyment in eating and drinking. 
CHAP. L.--IN WHAT SENSE FLESH AND BLOOD ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE KINGDOM OF 
GOD.
Putting aside, however, all interpretations of this sort, which criminate the 
works of the flesh and blood, it may be permitted me to claim for the 
resurrection these very substances, understood in none other than their natural 
sense. For it is not the resurrection that is directly denied to flesh and 
blood, but the kingdom of God, which is incidental to the resurrection (for 
there is a resurrection of judgment also); and there is even a confirmation of 
the general resurrection of the flesh, whenever a special one is excepted. Now, 
when it is clearly stated what the condition is to which the resurrection does 
not lead, it is understood what that is to which it does lead; and, therefore, 
whilst it is in consideration of men's merits that a difference is made in their 
resurrection by their conduct in the flesh, and not by the substance thereof, it 
is evident even from this, that flesh and blood are excluded from the kingdom of 
God in respect of their sin, not of their substance; and although in respect of 
their natural condition they will rise again for the judgment, because they rise 
not for the kingdom. Again, I will say, "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the 
kingdom of God;" and justly (does the apostle declare this of them, considered) 
alone and in themselves, in order to show that the Spirit is still needed (to 
qualify them) for the kingdom. For it is "the Spirit that quickeneth" us for the 
kingdom of God; "the flesh profiteth nothing." There is, however, something else 
which can be profitable thereunto, that is, the Spirit; and through the Spirit, 
the works also of the Spirit. Flesh and blood, therefore, must in every case 
rise again, equally, in their proper quality. But they to whom it is granted to 
enter the kingdom of God, will have to put on the power of an incorruptible and 
immortal life; for without this, or before they are able to obtain it, they 
cannot enter into the kingdom of God. With good reason, then, flesh and blood, 
as we have already said, by themselves fail to 584 
obtain the kingdom of God. But inasmuch as "this corruptible (that is, the 
flesh) must put on incorruption, and this mortal (that is, the blood) must put 
on immortality,'' by the change which is to follow the resurrection, it will, 
for the best of reasons, happen that flesh and blood, after that change and 
investiture, will become able to inherit the kingdom of God--but not without the 
resurrection. Some will have it, that by the phrase "flesh and blood," because 
of its rite of circumcision, Judaism is meant, which is itself too alienated 
from the kingdom of God, as being accounted "the old or former conversation," 
and as being designated by this title in another passage of the apostle also, 
who, "when it pleased God to reveal to him His Son, to preach Him amongst the 
heathen, immediately conferred not with flesh and blood," as he writes to the 
Galatians, (meaning by the phrase) the circumcision, that is to say, Judaism. 
CHAP. LI.--THE SESSION OF JESUS IN HIS INCARNATE NATURE AT THE 
RIGHT HAND OF GOD A GUARANTEE OF THE RESURRECTION OF OUR FLESH.
That, however, which we have reserved for a concluding argument, will now 
stand as a plea for all, and for the apostle himself, who in very deed would 
have to be charged with extreme indiscretion, if he had so abruptly, as some 
will have it, and as they say, blindfold, and so indiscriminately, and so 
unconditionally, excluded from the kingdom of God, and indeed from the court of 
heaven itself, all flesh and blood whatsoever; since Jesus is still sitting 
there at the right hand of the Father, man, yet God--the last Adam, yet the 
primary Word--flesh and blood, yet purer than ours--who "shall descend in like 
manner as He ascended into heaven" the same both in substance and form, as the 
angels affirmed, so as even to be recognised by those who pierced Him. 
Designated, as He is, "the Mediator' between God and man," He keeps in His own 
self the deposit of the flesh which has been committed to Him by both 
parties--the pledge and security of its entire perfection. For as "He has given 
to us the earnest of the Spirit, " so has He received from us the earnest of the 
flesh, and has carried it with Him into heaven as a pledge of that complete 
entirety which is one day to be restored to it. Be not disquieted, O flesh and 
blood, with any care; in Christ you have acquired both heaven and the kingdom of 
God. Otherwise, if they say that you are not in Christ, let them also say that 
Christ is not in heaven, since they have denied you heaven. Likewise "neither 
shall corruption," says he, "inherit incorruption. This he says, not that you 
may take flesh and blood to be corruption, for they are themselves rather the 
subjects of corruption,--I mean through death, since death does not so much 
corrupt, as actually consume, our flesh and blood. But inasmuch as he had 
plainly said that the works of the flesh and blood could not obtain the kingdom 
of God, with the view of stating this with accumulated stress, he deprived 
corruption itself--that is, death, which profits so largely by the works of the 
flesh and blood--from all inheritance of incorruption. For a little afterwards, 
he has described what is, as it were, the death of death itself: "Death," says 
he, "is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is 
thy victory? The sting of death is sin "--here is the corruption; "and the 
strength of sin is the law"--that other law, no doubt, which he has described 
"in his members as warring against the law of his mind,"--meaning, of course, 
the actual power of sinning against his will. Now he says in a previous passage 
(of our Epistle to the Corinthians), that "the last enemy to be destroyed is 
death." In this way, then, it is that corruption shall not inherit incorruption; 
in other words, death shall not continue. When and how shall it cease? In that 
"moment, that twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, when the dead shall rise 
incorruptible." But what are these, if not they who were corruptible 
before--that is, our bodies; in other words, our flesh and blood? 
And we undergo the change. But in what condition, if not in that wherein we 
shall be found? "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal 
must put on immortality." What mortal is this but the flesh? what corruptible 
but the blood. Moreover, that you may not suppose the apostle to have any other 
meaning, in his care to teach you, and that you may understand him seriously to 
apply his statement to the flesh, when he says "this corruptible" and "this 
mortal," he utters the words 585 
while touching the surface of his own body. He certainly could not have 
pronounced these phrases except in reference to an object which was palpable and 
apparent. The expression indicates a bodily exhibition. Moreover, a corruptible 
body is one thing, and corruption is another; so a mortal body is one thing, and 
mortality is another. For that which suffers is one thing, and that which causes 
it to suffer is another. Consequently, those things which are subject to 
corruption and mortality, even the flesh and blood, must needs also be 
susceptible of incorruption and immortality. 
CHAP. LII.--FROM ST. PAUL'S ANALOGY OF THE SEED WE LEARN THAT THE BODY 
WHICH DIED WILL RISE AGAIN, GARNISHED WITH THE APPLIANCES OF ETERNAL 
LIFE.
Let us now see in what body he asserts that the dead will come. And with a 
felicitous sally he proceeds at once to illustrate the point, as if an objector 
had plied him with some such question. "Thou fool," says he, "that which thou 
sowest is not quickened, except it die." From this example of the seed it is 
then evident that no other flesh is quickened than that which shall have 
undergone death, and therefore all the rest of the question will become clear 
enough. For nothing which is incompatible with the idea suggested by the example 
can possibly be understood; nor from the clause which follows, "That which thou 
sowest, thou sowest not the body which shall be," are you permitted to suppose 
that in the resurrection a different body is to arise from that which is sown in 
death. Otherwise you have run away from the example. For if wheat be sown and 
dissolved in the ground, barley does not spring up. Still it is not the very 
same grain in kind; nor is its nature the same, or its quality and form. Then 
whence comes it, if it is not the very same? For even the decay is a proof of 
the thing itself, since it is the decay of the actual grain. Well, but does not 
the apostle himself suggest in what sense it is that "the body which shall be" 
is not the body which is sown, even when he says, "But bare grain, it may chance 
of wheat, or of some other grain; but God giveth it a body as it pleaseth Him?'' 
Gives it of course to the grain which he says is sown bare. No doubt, you say. 
Then the grain is safe enough, to which God has to assign a body. But how safe, 
if it is nowhere in existence, if it does not rise again if it rises not again 
its actual self? If it rises not again, it is not safe; and if it is not even 
safe, it cannot receive a body from God. But there is every possible proof that 
it is safe. For what purpose, therefore, will God give it "a body, as it pleases 
Him," even when it already has its own "bare" body, unless it be that in its 
resurrection it may be no longer bare? That therefore will be additional matter 
which is placed over the bare body; nor is that at all destroyed on which the 
superimposed matter is put,--nay, it is increased. That, however, is safe which 
receives augmentation. The truth is, it is sown the barest grain, without a husk 
to cover it, without a spike even in germ, without the protection of a bearded 
top, without the glory of a stalk. It rises, however, out of the furrow enriched 
with a copious crop, built up in a compact fabric, constructed in a beautiful 
order, fortified by cultivation, and clothed around on every side. These are the 
circumstances which make it another body from God, to which it is changed not by 
abolition, but by amplification. And to every seed God has assigned its own 
body--not, indeed, its own in the sense of its primitive body--in order that 
what it acquires from God extrinsically may also at last be accounted its own. 
Cleave firmly then to the example, and keep it well in view, as a mirror of what 
happens to the flesh: believe that the very same flesh which was once sown in 
death will bear fruit in resurrection-life--the same in essence, only more full 
and perfect; not another, although reappearing in another form. For it shall 
receive in itself the grace and ornament which God shall please to spread over 
it, according to its merits. Unquestionably it is in this sense that he says, 
"All flesh is not the same flesh;" meaning not to deny a community of substance, 
but a parity of prerogative,--reducing the body to a difference of honour, not 
of nature. With this view he adds, in a figurative sense, certain examples of 
animals and heavenly bodies: "There is one flesh of man" (that is, servants of 
God, but really human), "another flesh of beasts" (that is, the heathen, of whom 
the prophet actually says, "Man is like the senseless cattle"), "another flesh 
of birds" (that is, the martyrs which essay to mount up to heaven), "another of 
fishes" (that is, those whom the water of baptism has submerged). In like manner 
does he take examples from the heavenly 586 
bodies: "There is one glory of the sun" (that is, of Christ), "and another 
glory of the moon" (that is, of the Church), "and another glory of the stars" 
(in other words, of the seed of Abraham). "For one star differeth from another 
star in glory: so there are bodies terrestrial as well as celestial" (Jews, that 
is, as well as Christians). Now, if this language is not to be construed 
figuratively, it was absurd enough for him to make a contrast between the flesh 
of mules and kites, as well as the heavenly bodies and human bodies; for they 
admit of no comparison as to their condition, nor in respect of their attainment 
of a resurrection. Then at last, having conclusively shown by his examples that 
the difference was one of glory, not of substance, he adds: "So also is the 
resurrection of the dead." How so? In no other way than as differing in glory 
only. For again, predicating the resurrection of the same substance and 
returning once more to (his comparison of) the grain, he says: "It is sown in 
corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour, it is raised 
in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural 
body, it is raised a spiritual body." Now, certainly nothing else is raised than 
that which is sown; and nothing else is sown than that which decays in the 
ground; and it is nothing else than the flesh which is decayed in the ground. 
For this was the substance which God's decree demolished, "Earth thou art, and 
to earth shalt thou return;" because it was taken out of the earth. And it was 
from this circumstance that the apostle borrowed his phrase of the flesh being 
"sown," since it returns to the ground, and the ground is the grand depository 
for seeds which are meant to be deposited in it, and again sought out of it. And 
therefore he confirms the passage afresh, by putting on it the impress (of his 
own inspired authority), saying, "For so it is written;" that you may not 
suppose that the "being sown" means anything else than "thou shalt return to the 
ground, out of which thou wast taken;" nor that the phrase "for so it is 
written" refers to any other thing that the flesh. 
CHAP. LIII.--NOT THE SOUL, BUT THE NATURAL BODY WHICH DIED, IS THAT WHICH 
IS TO RISE AGAIN. THE RESURRECTION OF LAZARUS COMMENTED ON. CHRIST'S 
RESURRECTION, AS THE SECOND ADAM,GUARANTEES OUR OWN.
Some, however, contend that the soul is "the natural (or animate) body, " 
with the view of withdrawing the flesh from all connection with the risen body. 
Now, since it is a clear and fixed point that the body which is to rise again is 
that which was sown in death, they must be challenged to an examination of the 
very fact itself. Else let them show that the soul was sown after death; in a 
word, that it underwent death,--that is, was demolished, dismembered, dissolved 
in the ground, nothing of which was ever decreed against it by God: let them 
display to our view its corruptibility and dishonour (as well as) its weakness, 
that it may also accrue to it to rise again in incorruption, and in glory, and 
in power? Now in the ease of Lazarus, (which we may take as) the palmary 
instance of a resurrection, the flesh lay prostrate in weakness, the flesh was 
almost putrid in the dishonour of its decay, the flesh stank in corruption, and 
yet it was as flesh that Lazarus rose again--with his soul, no doubt. But that 
soul was incorrupt; nobody had wrapped it in its linen swathes; nobody had 
deposited it in a grave; nobody had yet preceived it "stink;" nobody for four 
days had seen it "sown." Well, now, this entire condition, this whole end of 
Lazarus, the flesh indeed of all men is still experiencing, but the soul of no 
one. That substance, therefore, to which the apostle's whole description 
manifestly refers, of which he clearly speaks, must be both the natural (or 
animate) body when it is sown, and the spiritual body when it is raised again. 
For in order that you may understand it in this sense, he points to this same 
conclusion, when in like manner, on the authority of the same passage of 
Scripture, he displays to us "the first man Adam as made a living soul." Now 
since Adam was the first man, since also the flesh was man prior to the soul? it 
undoubtedly follows that it was the flesh that became the living soul. Moreover, 
since it was a bodily substance that assumed this condition, it was of course 
the natural (or animate) body that became the living soul. By what designation 
would they have it called, except that which it became through the soul, except 
that which it was not previous to the soul, except that which it can never be 
after the soul, but through its resurrection? For after it has recovered the 
soul, it once more becomes the natural (or animate) body, in order that it may 
become a spiritual body. For it only resumes in the resurrection the condition 
which it once 587 
had. There is therefore by no means the same good reason why the soul should 
be called the natural (or animate) body, which the flesh has for bearing that 
designation. The flesh, in fact, was a body before it was an animate body. When 
the flesh was joined by the soul, it then became the natural (or animate) body. 
Now, although the soul is a corporeal substance, yet, as it is not an animated 
body, but rather an animating one, it cannot be called the animate (or natural) 
body, nor can it become that thing which it produces. It is indeed when the soul 
accrues to something else that it makes that thing animate; but unless it so 
accrues, how will it ever produce animation? As therefore the flesh was at first 
an animate (or natural) body on receiving the soul, so at last will it become a 
spiritual body when invested with the spirit. Now the apostle, by severally 
adducing this order in Adam and in Christ, fairly distinguishes between the two 
states, in the very essentials of their difference. And when he calls Christ 
"the last Adam," you may from this circumstance discover how strenuously he 
labours to establish throughout his teaching the resurrection of the flesh, not 
of the soul. Thus, then, the first man Adam was flesh, not soul, and only 
afterwards became a living soul; and the last Adam, Christ, was Adam only 
because He was man, and only man as being flesh, not as being soul. Accordingly 
the apostle goes on to say: "Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but 
that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual," as in the case of 
the two Adams. Now, do you not suppose that he is distinguishing between the 
natural body and the spiritual body in the same flesh, after having already 
drawn the distinction therein in the two Adams, that is, in the first man and in 
the last? For from which substance is it that Christ and Adam have a parity with 
each other? No doubt it is from their flesh, although it may be from their soul 
also. It is, however, in respect of the flesh that they are both man; for the 
flesh was man prior to the saul. It was actually from it that they were able to 
take rank, so as to be deemed--one the first, and the other the last man, or 
Adam. 
Besides, things which are different in character are only incapable of being 
arranged in the same order when their diversity is one of substance; for when it 
is a diversity either in respect of place, or of time, or of condition, they 
probably do admit of classification together. Here, however, they are called 
first and last, from the substance of their (common) flesh, just as afterwards 
again the first man (is said to be) of the earth, and the second of heaven; but 
although He is "of heaven" in respect of the spirit, He is yet man according to 
the flesh. Now since it is the flesh, and not the soul, that makes an order (or 
classification together) in the two Adams compatible, so that the distinction is 
drawn between them of "the first man becoming a living soul, and the last a 
quickening spirit," so in like manner this distinction between them has already 
suggested the conclusion that the distinction is due to the flesh; so that it is 
of the flesh that these words speak: "Howbeit that was not first which is 
spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual." 
And thus, too, the same flesh must be understood in a preceding passage: "That 
which is sown is the natural body, and that which rises again is the spiritual 
body; because that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural: 
since the first Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam a quickening spirit." 
It is all about man, and all about the flesh because about man. 
What shall we say then? Has not the flesh even now (in this life) the spirit 
by faith? so that the question still remains to be asked, how it is that the 
animate (or natural) body can be said to be sown? Surely the flesh has received 
even here the spirit--but only its "earnest;" whereas of the soul (it has 
received) not the earnest, but the full possession. Therefore it has the name of 
animate (or natural) body, expressly because of the higher substance of the soul 
(or animal,) in which it is sown, destined hereafter to become, through the full 
possession of the spirit which it shall obtain, the spiritual body, in which it 
is raised again. What wonder, then, if it is more commonly called after the 
substance with which it is fully furnished, than after that of which it has yet 
but a sprinkling? 
CHAP. LIV.--DEATH SWALLOWED UP OF LIFE. MEANING OF THIS PHRASE IN RELATION 
TO THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY.
Then, again, questions very often are suggested by occasional and isolated 
terms, just as much as they are by connected sentences. Thus, because of the 
apostle's expression, "that mortality may be swallowed up of life "-- in 
reference to the flesh--they wrest 588 
the word swallowed up into the sense of the actual destruction of the flesh; 
as if we might not speak of ourselves as swallowing bile, or swallowing grief, 
meaning that we conceal and hide it, and keep it within ourselves. The truth is, 
when it is written, "This mortal must put on immortality," it is explained in 
what sense it is that "mortality is swallowed up of life "--even whilst, clothed 
with immortality, it is hidden and concealed, and contained within it, not as 
consumed, and destroyed, and lost. But death, you will say in reply to me, at 
this rate, must be safe, even when it has been swallowed up. Well, then, I ask 
you to distinguish words which are similar in form according to their proper 
meanings. Death is one thing, and morality is another. It is one thing for death 
to be swallowed up, and another thing for mortality to be swallowed up. Death is 
incapable of immortality, but not so mortality. Besides, as it is written that 
"this mortal must put on immortality," how is this possible when it is swallowed 
up of life? But how is it swallowed up of life, (in the sense of destroyed by 
it) when it is actually received, and restored, and included in it? For the 
rest, it is only just and right that death should be swallowed up in utter 
destruction, since it does itself devour with this same intent. Death, says the 
apostle, has devoured by exercising its strength, and therefore has been itself 
devoured in the struggle "swallowed up in victory." "O death, where is thy 
sting? O death, where is thy victory?" Therefore life, too, as the great 
antagonist of death, will in the struggle swallow up for salvation what death, 
in its struggle, had swallowed up for destruction. 
CHAP. LV.--THE CHANGE OF A THING'S CONDITION IS NOT THE DESTRUCTION OF ITS 
SUBSTANCE. THE APPLICATION OF THIS PRINCIPLE TO OUR SUBJECT.
Now although, in proving that the flesh shall rise again we ipso facto prove 
that no other flesh will partake of that resurrection than that which is in 
question, yet insulated questions and their occasions do require even 
discussions of their own, even if they have been already sufficiently met. We 
will therefore give a fuller explanation of the force and the reason of a change 
which (is so great, that it) almost suggests the presumption that it is a 
different flesh which is to rise again; as if, indeed, so great a change 
amounted to utter cessation, and a complete destruction of the former self. A 
distinction, however, must be made between a change, however great, and 
everything which has the character of distruction. For undergoing change is one 
thing, but being destroyed is another thing. Now this distinction would no 
longer exist, if the flesh were to suffer such a change as amounts to 
destruction. Destroyed, however, it must be by the change, unless it shall 
itself persistently remain throughout the altered condition which shall be 
exhibited in the resurrection. For precisely as it perishes, if it does not rise 
again, so also does it equally perish even if it does rise again, on the 
supposition that it is lost in the change. It will as much fail of a future 
existence, as if it did not rise again at all. And how absurd is it to rise 
again for the purpose of not having a being, when it had it in its power not to 
rise again, and so lose airs being--because it had already begun its 
non-existence! Now, things which are absolutely different, as mutation and 
destruction are, will not admit of mixture and confusion; in their operations, 
too, they differ. One destroys, the other changes. Therefore, as that which is 
destroyed is not changed, so that which is changed is not destroyed. To perish 
is altogether to cease to be what a thing once was, whereas to be changed is to 
exist in another condition. Now, if a thing exists in another condition, it can 
still be the same thing itself; for since it does not perish, it has its 
existence still. A change, indeed, it has experienced, but not a destruction. A 
thing may undergo a complete change, and yet remain still the same thing. In 
like manner, a man also may be quite himself in substance even in the present 
life, and for all that undergo various changes--in habit, in bodily bulk, in 
health, in condition, in dignity, and m age--in taste, business, means, houses, 
laws and customs--and still lose nothing of his human nature, nor so to be made 
another man as to cease to be the same; indeed, I ought hardly to say another 
man, but another thing. This form of change even the Holy Scriptures give us 
instances of. The hand of Moses is changed, and it becomes like a dead one, 
bloodless, colourless, and stiff with cold; but on the recovery of heat, and on 
the restoration of its natural colour, it is again the same flesh and blood? 
Afterwards the face of the same Moses is changed, with a brightness which eye 
could not bear. But he was Moses still, even when he was not visible. So also 
Stephen had already put on the appearance of an angel, although they were none 
other 589 
than his human knees which bent beneath the stoning. The Lord, again, in the 
retirement of the mount, had changed His raiment for a robe of light; but He 
still retained features which Peter could recognise. In that same scene Moses 
also and Elias gave proof that the same condition of bodily existence may 
continue even in glory--the one in the likeness of a flesh which he had not yet 
recovered, the other in the reality of one which 'he had not yet put off. It was 
as full of this splendid example that Paul said: "Who shall change our vile 
body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body." But if you maintain 
that a transfiguration and a conversion amounts to the annihilation of any 
substance, then it follows that "Saul, when changed into another man," passed 
away from his own bodily substance; and that Satan himself, when "transformed 
into an angel of light," loses his own proper character. Such is not my opinion. 
So likewise changes, conversions and reformations will necessarily take place to 
bring about the resurrection, but the substance of the flesh will still be 
preserved safe. 
CHAP. LVI.--THE PROCEDURE OF THE LAST JUDGMENT, AND ITS AWARDS, 
ONLY POSSIBLE ON THE IDENTITY OF THE RISEN BODY WITH OUR PRESENT FLESH.
For how absurd, and in truth how unjust, and in both respects how unworthy of 
God, for one substance to do the work, and another to reap the reward: that this 
flesh of ours should be torn by martyrdom, and another wear the crown; or, on 
the other hand, that this flesh of ours should wallow in uncleanness, and 
another receive the condemnation! Is it not better to renounce all faith at once 
in the hope of the resurrection, than to trifle with the wisdom and justice of 
God? Better that Marcion should rise again than Valentinus. For it cannot be 
believed that the mind, or the memory, or the conscience of existing man is 
abolished by putting on that change of raiment which immortality and 
incorruption supplies; for in that case all the gain and fruit of the 
resurrection, and the permanent effect of God's judgment both on soul and body, 
would certainly fall to the ground. If I remember not that it is I who have 
served Him, how shall I ascribe glory to God? How sing to Him "the new song,"if 
I am ignorant that it is I who owe Him thanks? But why is exception taken only 
against the change of the flesh, and not of the soul also, which in all things 
is superior to the flesh? How happens it, that the self-same soul which in our 
present flesh has gone through all life's course, which has learnt the knowledge 
of God, and put on Christ, and sown the hope of salvation in this flesh, must 
reap its harvest in another flesh of which we know nothing? Verily that must be 
a most highly favoured flesh, which shall have the enjoyment of life at so 
gratuitous a rate! But if the soul is not to be changed also, then there is no 
resurrection of the soul; nor will it be believed to have itself risen, unless 
it has risen some different thing. 
CHAP. LVII.--OUR BODIES, HOWEVER MUTILATED BEFORE OR AFTER DEATH, 
SHALL RECOVER THEIR PERFECT INTEGRITY IN THE RESURRECTION. ILLUSTRATION' OF THE 
ENFRANCHISED SLAVE.
We now come to the most usual cavil of unbelief. If, they say, it be actully 
the selfsame substance which is recalled to life with all its form, and 
lineaments, and quality, then why not with all its other characteristics? Then 
the blind, and the lame, and the palsied, and whoever else may have passed away 
with any conspicuous mark, will return again with the same. What now is the 
fact, although you in the greatness of your conceit thus disdain to accept from 
God so vast a grace? Does it not happen that, when you now admit the salvation 
of only the soul, you ascribe it to men at the cost of half their nature? What 
is the good of believing in the resurrection, unless your faith embraces the 
whole of it? If the flesh is to be repaired after its dissolution, much more 
will it be restored after some violent injury. Greater cases prescribe rules for 
lesser ones. Is not the amputation or the crushing of a limb the death of that 
limb? Now, if the death of the whole person is rescinded by its resurrection, 
what must we say of the death of a part of him? If we are changed for glory, how 
much more for integrity! Any loss sustained by our bodies is an accident to 
them, but their entirety is their natural property. In this condition we are 
born. Even if we become injured in the womb, this is loss suffered by what is 
already a human being. Natural condition" is prior to injury. As life is 
bestowed by God, so is 590 
it restored by Him. As we are when we receive it, so are we when we recover 
it. To nature, not to injury, are we restored; to our state by birth, not to our 
condition by accident, do we rise again. If God raises not men entire, He raises 
not the dead. For what dead man is entire, although he dies entire? Who is 
without hurt, that is without life? What body is uninjured, when it is dead, 
when it is cold, when it is ghastly, when it is stiff, when it is a corpse? When 
is a man more infirm, than when he is entirely infirm? When more palsied, than 
when quite motionless? Thus, for a dead man to be raised again, amounts to 
nothing short of his being restored to his entire condition,--lest he, forsooth, 
be still dead in that part in which he has not risen again. God is quite able to 
re-make what He once made. This power and this unstinted grace of His He has 
already sufficiently guaranteed in Christ; and has displayed Himself to us (in 
Him) not only as the restorer of the flesh, but as the repairer of its breaches. 
And so the apostle says: "The dead shall be raised incorruptible" (or 
unimpaired). But how so, unless they become entire, who have wasted away either 
in the loss of their health, or in the long decrepitude of the grave? For when 
he propounds the two clauses, that "this corruptible must put on incorruption, 
and this mortal must put on immortality, " he does not repeat the same 
statement, but sets forth a distinction. For, by assigning immortality to the 
repeating of death, and incorruption to the repairing of the wasted body, he has 
fitted one to the raising and the other to the retrieval of the body. I suppose, 
moreover, that he promises to the Thessalonians the integrity of the whole 
substance of man. So that for the great future there need be no fear of 
blemished or defective bodies. Integrity, whether the result of preservation or 
restoration, will be able to lose nothing more, after the time that it has given 
back to it whatever it had lost. Now, when you contend that the flesh will still 
have to undergo the same sufferings, if the same flesh be said to have to rise 
again, you rashly set up nature against her Lord, and impiously contrast her law 
against His grace; as if it were not permitted the Lord God both to change 
nature, and to preserve her, without subjection to a law. How is it, then, that 
we read, "With men these things are impossible, but with God all things are 
possible;" and again, "God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to 
confound the wise?" Let me ask you, if you were to manumit your slave (seeing 
that the same flesh and soul will remain to him, which once were exposed to the 
whip, and the fetter, and the stripes), will it therefore be fit for him to 
undergo the same old sufferings? I trow not. He is instead thereof honoured with 
the grace of the white robe, and the favour of the gold ring, and the name and 
tribe as well as table of his patron. Give, then, the same prerogative to God, 
by virtue of such a change, of reforming our condition, not our nature, by 
taking away from it all sufferings, and surrounding it with safeguards of 
protection. Thus our flesh shall remain even after the resurrection--so far 
indeed susceptible of suffering, as it is the flesh, and the same flesh too; but 
at the same time impassible, inasmuch as it has been liberated by the Lord for 
the very end and purpose of being no longer capable of enduring suffering. 
CHAP. LVIII.--FROM THIS PERFECTION OF OUR RESTORED BODIES WILL FLOW THE 
CONSCIOUSNESS OF UNDISTURBED JOY AND PEACE.
"Everlasting joy," says Isaiah, "shall be upon their heads." Well, there is 
nothing eternal until after the resurrection. "And sorrow and sighing," 
continues he, "shall flee away." The angel echoes the same to John: "And God 
shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;" from the same eyes indeed which had 
formerly wept, and which might weep again, if the loving-kindness of God did not 
dry up every fountain of tears. And again: "God shall wipe away all tears from 
their eyes; and there shall be no more death," and therefore no more corruption, 
it being chased away by incorruption, even as death is by immortality. If 
sorrow, and mourning, and sighing, and death itself, assail us from the 
afflictions both of soul and body, how shall they be removed, except by the 
cessation of their causes, that is to say, the afflictions of flesh and soul? 
where will you find adversities in the presence of God? where, incursions of an 
enemy in the bosom of Christ? where, attacks of the devil in the face of the 
Holy Spirit?--now that the devil himself and his angels are "cast into the lake 
of fire." Where now is necessity, and what they call fortune or fate? What 
plague awaits the redeemed from death, after their eternal pardon? What wrath is 
there for the reconciled, after grace? What weakness, after their 591 
renewed strength? What risk and danger, after their salvation? That the 
raiment and shoes of the children of Israel remained unworn and fresh for the 
space of forty years; that in their very persons the exact point of convenience 
and propriety checked the rank growth of their nails and hair, so that any 
excess herein might not be attributed to indecency; that the fires of Babylon 
injured not either the mitres or the trousers of the three brethren, however 
foreign such dress might be to the Jews; that Jonah was swallowed by the monster 
of the deep, in whose belly whole ships were devoured, and after three days was 
vomited out again safe and sound; that Enoch and Elias, who even now, without 
experiencing a resurrrection (because they have not even encountered death), are 
learning to the full what it is for the flesh to be exempted from all 
humilation, and all loss, and all injury, and all disgrace--translated as they 
have been from this world, and from this very cause already candidates for 
everlasting life; --to what faith do these notable facts bear witness, if not to 
that which ought to inspire in us the belief that they are proofs and documents 
of our own future integrity and perfect resurrection? For, to borrow the 
apostle's phrase, these were "figures of ourselves; " and they are written that 
we may believe both that the Lord is more powerful than all natural laws about 
the body, and that He shows Himself the preserver of the flesh the more 
emphatically, in that He has preserved for it its very clothes and shoes. 
CHAP. LIX.--OUR FLESH IN THE RESURRECTION CAPABLE, WITHOUT LOSING ITS 
ESSENTIAL IDENTITY, OF BEARING THE CHANGED CONDITIONS OF ETERNAL LIFE, OR 
OF DEATH ETERNAL.
But, you object, the world to come bears the character of a different 
dispensation, even an eternal one; and therefore, you maintain, that the 
non-eternal substance of this life is incapable of possessing a state of such 
different features. This would be true enough, if man were made for the future 
dispensation, and not the dispensation for man. The apostle, however, in his 
epistle says, "Whether it be the world, or life, or death, or things present, or 
things to come; all are yours: " and he here constitutes us heirs even of the 
future world. Isaiah gives you no help when he says, "All flesh is grass;" and 
in another passage, "All flesh shall see the salvation of God." It is the issues 
of men, not their substances, which he distinguishes. But who does not hold that 
the judgment of God consists in the twofold sentence, of salvation and of 
punishment? Therefore it is that "all flesh is grass," which is destined to the 
fire; and "all flesh shall see the salvation of God," which is ordained to 
eternal life. For myself, I am quite sure that it is in no other flesh than my 
own that I have committed adultery, nor in any other flesh am I striving after 
continence. If there be any one who bears about in his person two instruments of 
lasciviousness, he has it in his power, to be sure, to mow down "the grass" of 
the unclean flesh, and to reserve for himself only that which shall see the 
salvation of God. But when the same prophet represents to us even nations 
sometimes estimated as "the small dust of the balance," and as "less than 
nothing, and vanity," 
and sometimes as about to hope and "trust in the name" and arm of the Lord, 
are we at all misled respecting the Gentile nations by the diversity of 
statement? Are some of them to turn believers, and are others accounted dust, 
from any difference of nature? Nay, rather Christ has shone as the true light on 
the nations within the ocean's limits, and from the heaven which is over us all. 
Why, it is even on this earth that the Valentinians have gone to school for 
their errors; and there will be no difference of condition, as respects their 
body and soul, between the nations which believe and those which do not believe. 
Precisely, then, as He has put a distinction of state, not of nature, amongst 
the same nations, so also has He discriminated their flesh, which is one and the 
same substance in those nations, not according to their material structure, but 
according to the recompense of their merit. 
CHAP. LX.--ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR BODIES--SEX, VARIOUS LIMBS, 
ETC.--WILL BE RETAINED, WHATEVER CHANGE OF FUNCTIONS THESE MAY HAVE, OF 
WHICH POINT, HOWEVER, WE ARE NO JUDGES. ANALOGY OF THE REPAIRED SHIP.
But behold how presistently they still accumulate their cavils against the 
flesh, especially against its identity, deriving their argu 592 
ments even from the functions of our limbs; on the one hand saying that these 
ought to continue permanently pursuing their labours and enjoyments, as 
appendages to the same corporeal frame; and on the other hand contending that, 
inasmuch as the functions of the limbs shall one day come to an end, the bodily 
frame itself must be destroyed, its permanence without its limbs being deemed to 
be as inconceivable, as that of the limbs themselves without their functions! 
What, they ask, will then be the use of the cavity of our mouth, and its rows of 
teeth, and the passage of the throat, and the branch-way of the stomach, and the 
gulf of the belly, and the entangled tissue of the bowels, when there shall no 
longer be room for eating and drinking? What more will there be for these 
members to take in, masticate, swallow, secrete, digest, eject? Of what avail 
will be our very hands, and feet, and all our labouring limbs, when even all 
care about food shall cease? What purpose can be served by loins, conscious of 
seminal secretions, and all the other organs of generation, in the two sexes, 
and the laboratories of embryos, and the fountains of the breast, when 
concubinage, and pregnancy, and infant nurture shall cease? In short, what will 
be the use of the entire body, when the entire body shall become useless? In 
reply to all this, we have then already settled the principle that the 
dispensation of the future state ought not to be compared with that of the 
present world, and that in the interval between them a change will take place; 
and we now add the remark, that these functions of our bodily limbs will 
continue to supply the needs of this life up to the moment when life itself 
shall pass away from time to eternity, as the natural body gives place to the 
spiritual, until "this mortal puts on immorality, and this corruptible puts on 
incorruption:" so that when life shall itself become freed from all wants, our 
limbs shall then be freed also from their services, and therefore will be no 
longer wanted. Still, although liberated from their offices, they will be yet 
preserved for judgment, "that every one may receive the things done in his 
body." For the judgment-seat of God requires that man be kept entire. Entire, 
however, he cannot be without his limbs, of the substance of which, not the 
functions, he consists; unless, forsooth, you will be bold enough to maintain 
that a ship is perfect without her keel, or her bow, or her stern, and without 
the solidity of her entire t frame. And yet how often have we seen the same 
ship, after being shattered with the storm and broken by decay, with all her 
timbers repaired and restored, gallantly riding on the wave in all the beauty of 
a renewed fabric! Do we then disquiet ourselves with doubt about God's skill, 
and will, and rights? Besides, if a wealthy shipowner, who does not grudge money 
merely for his amusement or show, thoroughly repairs his ship, and then chooses 
that she should make no further voyages, will you contend that the old form and 
finish is still not necessary to the vessel, although she is no longer meant for 
actual service, when the mere safety of a ship requires such completeness 
irrespective of service? The sole question, therefore, which is enough for us to 
consider here, is whether the Lord, when He ordains salvation for man, intends 
it for his flesh; whether it is His will that the selfsame flesh shall be 
renewed. If so, it will be improper for you to rule, from the inutility of its 
limbs in the future state, that the flesh will be incapable of renovation. For a 
thing may be renewed, and yet be useless from having nothing to do; but it 
cannot be said to be useless if it has no existence. If, indeed, it has 
existence, it will be quite possible for it also not to be useless; it may 
possibly have something to do; for in the presence of God there will be no 
idleness. 
CHAP. LXI.--THE DETAILS OF OUR BODILY SEX, AND OF THE FUNCTIONS OF OUR 
VARIOUS MEMBERS. APOLOGY FOR THE NECESSITY WHICH HERESY IMPOSES OF HUNTING UP 
ALL ITS UNBLUSHING CAVILS.
Now you have received your mouth, O man, for the purpose of devouring your 
food and imbibing your drink: why not, however, for the higher purpose of 
uttering speech, so as to distinguish yourself from all other animals? Why not 
rather for preaching the gospel of God, that so you may become even His priest 
and advocate before men? Adam indeed gave their several names to the animals, 
before he plucked the fruit of the tree; before he ate, he prophesied. Then, 
again, you received your teeth for the consumption of your meal: why not rather 
for wreathing your mouth with suitable defence on every opening thereof, small 
or wide? Why not, too, for moderating the impulses of your tongue, and guarding 
your articulate speech from failure and violence? Let me tell you, (if you do 
not know), that there are toothless persons in the world. Look at them, and ask 
whether even a cage of teeth be not an honour to the mouth. There are apertures 
in the lower regions of man and woman, by means of which they gratify no doubt 
their animal passions; but why are they not rather regarded as outlets for the 
cleanly 593 
discharge of natural fluids? Women, moreover, have within them receptacles 
where human seed may collect; but are they not designed for the secretion of 
those sanguineous issues, which their tardier and weaker sex is inadequate to 
disperse? For even details like these require to be mentioned, seeing that 
heretics single out what parts of our bodies may suit them, handle them without 
delicacy, and, as their whim suggests, pour torrents of scorn and contempt upon 
the natural functions of our members, for the purpose of upsetting the 
resurrection, and making us blush over their cavils; not reflecting that before 
the functions cease, the very causes of them will have passed away. There will 
be no more meat, because no more hunger; no more drink, because no more thirst; 
no more concubinage, because no more child-bearing; no more eating and drinking, 
because no more labour and toil. 
Death, too, will cease; so there will be no more need of the nutriment of 
food for the defence of life, nor will mothers' limbs any longer have to be 
laden for the replenishment of our race. But even in the present life there may 
be cessations of their office for our stomachs and our generative organs. For 
forty days Moses and Elias fasted, and lived upon God alone. For even so early 
was the principle consecrated: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every 
word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." See here faint outlines of our 
future strength! We even, as we may be able, excuse our mouths from food, and 
withdraw our sexes from union. How many voluntary eunuchs are there! How many 
virgins espoused to Christ! How many, both of men and women, whom nature has 
made sterile, with a structure which cannot procreate! Now, if even here on 
earth both the functions and the pleasures of our members may be suspended, with 
an intermission which, like the dispensation itself, can only be a temporary 
one, and yet man's safety is nevertheless unimpaired, how much more, when his 
salvation is secure, and especially in an eternal dispensation, shall we not 
cease to desire those things, for which, even here below, we are not 
unaccustomed to check our longings! 
CHAP. LXII.--OUR DESTINED LIKENESS TO THE ANGELS IN THE GLORIOUS LIFE OF 
THE RESURRECTION.
To this discussion, however, our Lord's declaration puts an effectual end: 
"They shall be," says He, "equal unto the angels." As by not marrying, because 
of not dying, so, of course, by not having to yield to any like necessity of our 
bodily state; even as the angels, too, sometimes. were "equal unto" men, by 
eating and drinking, and submitting their feet to the washing of the 
bath--having clothed themselves in human guise, without i the loss of their own 
intrinsic nature. If therefore angels, when they became as men, submitted in 
their own unaltered substance of spirit to be treated as if they were flesh, why 
shall not men in like manner, when they become "equal unto the angels," undergo 
in their unchanged substance of flesh the treatment of spiritual beings, no more 
exposed to the usual solicitations of the flesh in their angelic garb, than were 
the angels once to those of the spirit when encompassed in human form? We shall 
not therefore cease to continue in the flesh, because we cease to be importuned 
by the usual wants of the flesh; just as the angels ceased not therefore to 
remain in their spiritual substance, because of the suspension of their 
spiritual incidents. Lastly, Christ said not, "They shall be angels," in order 
not to repeal their existence as men; but He said, "They shall be equal unto the 
angels, that He might preserve their humanity unimpaired. When He ascribed an 
angelic likeness to the flesh, He took not from it its proper substance. 
CHAP. LXIII.--CONCLUSION. THE RESURRECTION OF THE FLESH IN ITS ABSOLUTE 
IDENTITY AND PERFECTION. BELIEF OF THIS HAD BECOME WEAK. HOPES FOR ITS 
REFRESHING RESTORATION UNDER THE INFLUENCES OF THE PARACLETE.
And so the flesh shall rise again, wholly in every man, in its own identity, 
in its absolute integrity. Wherever it may be, it is in safe keeping in God's 
presence, through that most faithful "Mediator between God and man, (the man) 
Jesus Christ," who shall reconcile both God to man, and man to God; the spirit 
to the flesh, and the flesh to the spirit. Both natures has He already united in 
His own self; He has fitted them together as bride and bridegroom in the 
reciprocal bond of wedded life. Now, if any should insist on making the soul the 
bride, then the flesh will follow the soul as her dowry. The soul shall never be 
an outcast, to be had home by the bridegroom bare and naked. She has her dower, 
her outfit, her fortune in the flesh, which shall accompany her with the love 
and fidelity of a foster-sister. But suppose the flesh to be the 594 
bride, then in Christ Jesus she has in the contract of His blood received His 
Spirit as her spouse. Now, what you take to be her extinction, you may be sure 
is only her temporary retirement. It is not the soul only which withdraws from 
view. The flesh, too, has her departures for a while--in waters, in fires, in 
birds, in beasts; she may seem to be dissolved into these, but she is only 
poured into them, as into vessels. And should the vessels themselves afterwards 
fail to hold her, escaping from even these, and returning to her mother earth, 
she is absorbed once more, as it were, by its secret embraces, ultimately to 
stand forth to view, like Adam when summoned to hear from his Lord and Creator 
the words, "Behold, the man is become as one of us!"--thoroughly "knowing" by 
that time "the evil" which she had escaped, "and the good" which she has 
acquired. Why, then, O soul, should you envy the flesh? There is none, after the 
Lord, whom you should love so dearly; none more like a brother to you, which is 
even born along with yourself in God. You ought rather to have been by your 
prayers obtaining resurrection for her: her sins, whatever they were, were owing 
to you. However, it is no wonder if you hate her; for you have repudiated her 
Creator. You have accustomed yourself either to deny or change her existence 
even in Christ--corrupting the very Word of God Himself, who became flesh, 
either by mutilating or misinterpreting the Scripture, and introducing, above 
all, apocryphal mysteries and blasphemous fables. But yet Almighty God, in His 
most gracious providence, by "pouring out of His Spirit in these last days, upon 
all flesh, upon His servants and on His handmaidens," has checked these 
impostures of unbelief and perverseness, reanimated men's faltering faith in the 
resurrection of the flesh, and cleared from all obscurity and equivocation the 
ancient Scriptures (of both God's Testaments) by the clear light of their 
(sacred) words and meanings. Now, since it was "needful that there should be 
heresies, in order that they which are approved might be made manifest;" since, 
however, these heresies would be unable to put on a bold front without some 
countenance from the Scriptures, it therefore is plain enough that the ancient 
Holy Writ has furnished them with sundry materials for their evil doctrine, 
which very materials indeed (so distorted) are refutable from the same 
Scriptures. It was fit and proper, therefore, that the Holy Ghost should no 
longer withhold the effusions of His gracious light upon these inspired 
writings, in order that they might be able to disseminate the seeds of truth 
with no admixture of heretical subtleties, and pluck out from it their tares. He 
has accordingly now dispersed all the perplexities of the past, and their 
self-chosen allegories and parables, by the open and perspicuous explanation of 
the entire mystery, through the new prophecy, which descends in copious streams 
from the Paraclete. If you will only draw water from His fountains, you will 
never thrist for other doctrine: no feverish craving after subtle questions will 
again consume you; but by drinking in evermore the resurrection of the flesh, 
you will be satisfied with the refreshing draughts.
