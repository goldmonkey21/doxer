The Oxyrhynchus 1224 Gospel














                  Papyrus Oxyrhnchus 1224
To quote Andrew Bernhard, author of
				The Lost Gospels, The following translation is based 
                  solely on the Greek text printed in The 
                  Oxyrhynchus Papyri, Vol. 10. POxy 1224 comes from 
                  a papyrus book which probably had pages that were probably about 
                  20 lines long. The top portions of six pages (139, [138 or 140], 
                  173, 174, 175, and 176) have been preserved in two fragments. 
                  The fragments which are separated by a substantial amount of 
                  material: fragment 1 is numbered as page 139, while the earliest 
                  visible page number on fragment 2 is 174. It is therefore not 
                  certain that the two fragments belong to the same text, although 
                  the possibility cannot be ruled out 


  




It 
                weighed me down. Then Jesus approached in a vision and said, "Why 
                are you discouraged? For not . . . you, but the . . . "
  
. . . "you 
                said, although you are not answering. What then did you renounce? 
                What is the new doctrine that they say you teach, or what is the 
                new baptism that you proclaim? Answer and . . . "


When the 
                scribes and Pharisees and priests saw him, they were angry that 
                he was reclining in the midst of sinners. But when Jesus heard, 
                he said, "Those who are healthy have no need of a physician 
                . . . "
  
" . 
                . . and pray for your enemies. For the one who is not against 
                you is for you. The one who is far away today, tomorrow will be 
                near you and in . . . the adversary . . .
