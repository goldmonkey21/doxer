Origen
LETTER OF ORIGEN TO GREGORY. 
When and to whom the Learning derived from Philosophy may be of Service for 
the Exposition of the Holy Scriptures; with a lively Personal Appeal. 
This letter to Gregory, afterwards bishop of Caesarea, and called 
Thaumaturgus, was preserved in the Philocalia, or collection of extracts from 
Origen's works drawn up by Gregory of Nyssa and Basil of Caesarea. It is printed 
by Delarue and Lommatzsch in the forefront of their editions of the works. It 
forms a good preface to the commentaries, as it shows how Origen considered the 
study of Scripture to be the highest of all studies, and how he regarded 
scientific learning, in which he was himself a master, as merely preparatory for 
this supreme learning. Draseke has shown that it was written about 235, when 
Origen, after having had Gregory as his pupil at Caesarea for some years, had 
fled before the persecution under Maximinus Thrax to Cappadocia; while Gregory, 
to judge from the tenor of this Epistle, had gone to Egypt. The Panegyric on 
Origen, pronounced by Gregory at Caesarea about 239, when the school had 
reassembled there after the persecution, shows that the master's solicitude for 
his pupil's true advancement was not disappointed. 
I. GREGORY IS URGED TO APPLY HIS GENTILE LEARNING TO THE STUDY OF SCRIPTURE. 
All hail to thee in God, most excellent and reverend Sir, son Gregory, from 
Origen. A natural quickness of understanding is fitted, as you are well aware, 
if it be diligently exercised, to produce a work which may bring its owner so 
far as is possible, if I may so express myself, to the consummation of the art 
the which he desires to practise, and your natural aptitude is sufficient to 
make you a consummate Roman lawyer and a Greek philosopher too of the most 
famous schools. But my desire for you has been that you should direct the whole 
force of your intelligence to Christianity as your end, and that in the way of 
production. And I would wish that you should take with you on the one hand those 
parts of the philosophy of the Greeks which are fit, as it were, to serve as 
general or preparatory studies for Christianity, and on the other hand so much 
of Geometry and Astronomy as may be helpful for the interpretation of the Holy 
Scriptures. The children of the philosophers speak of geometry and music and 
grammar and rhetoric and astronomy as being ancillary to philosophy; and in the 
same way we might speak of philosophy itself as being ancillary to Christianity. 

2. THIS PROCEDURE IS TYPIFIED BY THE STORY OF THE SPOILING OF THE EGYPTIANS. 
It is something of this sort perhaps that is enigmatically indicated in the 
directions God is represented in the Book of Exodus as giving to the children of 
lsrael. They are directed to beg from their neighbours and from those dwelling 
in their tents vessels of silver and of gold, and raiment; thus they are to 
spoil the Egyptians, and to obtain materials for making the things they are told 
to provide in connection with the worship of God. For out of the things of which 
the children of lsrael spoiled the Egyptians the furniture of the Holy of Holies 
was made, the ark with its cover, and the cherubim and the mercy-seat and the 
gold jar in which the manna, that bread of angels, was stored. These probably 
were made from the finest of the gold of the Egyptians, and from a second 
quality, perhaps, the solid golden candlestick which stood near the inner veil, 
and the lamps on it, and the golden table on which stood the shewbread, and 
between these two the golden altar of incense. And if there was gold of a third 
and of a fourth quality, the sacred vessels were made of it. And of the Egyptian 
silver, too, other things were made; for it was from their sojourn in Egypt that 
the children of lsrael derived the great advantage of being supplied with such a 
quantity of precious materials for the use of the service of God. Out of the 
Egyptian raiment probably were made all those requisites named in Scripture in 
embroidered work; the embroiderers working with the wisdom of God, such garments 
for such purposes, to produce the hangings and the inner and outer courts. This 
is not a suitable opportunity to enlarge on such a theme or to show in how many 
ways the children of Israel found those things useful which they got from the 
Egyptians. The Egyptians had not made a proper use of them; but the Hebrews used 
them, for the wisdom of God was with them, for religious purposes. Holy 
Scripture knows, however, that it was an evil thing to descend from the land of 
the children of lsrael into Egypt; and in this a great truth is wrapped up. For 
some it is of evil that they should dwell with the Egyptians, that is to say, 
with the learning of the world, after they have been enrolled in the law of God 
and in the Israelite worship of Him. Ader the Edomite, as long as he was in the 
land of Israel and did not taste the bread of the Egyptians, made no idols; but 
when he fled from the wise Solomon and went down into Egypt, as one who had fled 
from the wisdom of God he became connected with Pharaoh, marrying the sister of 
his wife, and begetting a son who was brought up among the sons of Pharaoh. 
Therefore, though he did go back to the land of Israel, he came back to it to 
bring division into the people of God, and to cause them to say to the golden 
calf, "These are thy gods, 0 Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of 
Egypt." I have learned by experience and can tell you that there are few who 
have taken of the useful things of Egypt and come out of it, and have then 
prepared what is required for the service of God; but Ader the Edomite on the 
other hand has many a brother. I mean those who, founding on some piece of Greek 
learning, have brought forth heretical ideas, and have as it were made golden 
calves in Bethel, which is, being interpreted, the house of God. This appears to 
me to be intended to convey that such persons set up their own images in the 
Scriptures in which the Word of God dwells, and which therefore are tropically 
called Bethel. The other image is said in the word to have been set up in Dan. 
Now the borders of Dan are at the extremities and are contiguous to the country 
of the heathens, as is plainly recorded in the Book of Jesus, son of Nave. Some 
of these images, then, are close to the borders of the heathen, which the 
brothers, as we showed, of Ader have devised. 
3. PERSONAL APPEAL. 
Do you then, sir, my son, study first of all the divine Scriptures. Study 
them I say. For we require to study the divine writings deeply, lest we should 
speak of them faster than we think; and while you study these divine works with 
a believing and God-pleasing intention, knock at that which is closed in them, 
and it shall be opened to thee by the porter, of whom Jesus says, "To him the 
porter openeth." While you attend to this divine reading seek aright and with 
unwavering faith in God the hidden sense which is present in most passages of 
the divine Scriptures. And do not be content with knocking and seeking, for what 
is most necessary for understanding divine things is prayer, and in urging us to 
this the Saviour says not only, "Knock, and it shall be opened to you," and 
"Seek, and ye shall find," but also "Ask, and it shall be given you." So much I 
have ventured on account of my fatherly love to you. 
Whether I have ventured well or not, God knows, and His Christ, and he who 
has part of the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ. May you partake in 
these; may you have an always increasing share of them, so that you may be able 
to say not only, "We are partakers of Christ," but also "We are partakers of 
God."
