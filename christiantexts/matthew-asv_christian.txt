The Gospel of Matthew












The Gospel According to St. Matthew 

1:1The book of the generation of Jesus 
Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. 
1:2Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat 
Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren; 1:3and Judah begat 
Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram; 1:4and 
Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon; 1:5and 
Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; 
1:6and Jesse begat David the king. 
And David begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah; 1:7and 
Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa; 1:8and 
Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah; 1:9and 
Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah; 1:10and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and 
Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah; 1:11and Josiah begat 
Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon. 
1:12And after the carrying away to Babylon, 
Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel; 1:13and Zerubbabel 
begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; 1:14and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat 
Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 1:15and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar 
begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 1:16and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of 
Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. 
1:17So all the generations from Abraham 
unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to 
Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto the 
Christ fourteen generations. 
1:18Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on 
this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came 
together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. 1:19And Joseph her 
husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, 
was minded to put her away privily. 1:20But when he thought on these things, 
behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou 
son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is 
conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. 1:21And she shall bring forth a son; and 
thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from 
their sins. 1:22Now all this is come to pass, that it 
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 
 1:23Behold, the virgin shall be with child, 
and shall bring forth a son, 
 And they shall call his name Immanuel; 
which is, being interpreted, God with us. 1:24And Joseph arose 
from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto 
him his wife; 1:25and knew her not till she had brought 
forth a son: and he called his name JESUS. 

2:1Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of 
Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise-men from the east came to 
Jerusalem, saying, 2:2Where is he that is born King of the 
Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are come to worship him. 2:3And 
when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 2:4And 
gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired 
of them where the Christ should be born. 2:5And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of 
Judaea: for thus it is written through the prophet, 
 2:6And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, 
 Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah: 
 For out of thee shall come forth a governor, 
 Who shall be shepherd of my people Israel. 
2:7Then Herod privily called the Wise-men, 
and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared. 2:8And he sent them to 
Bethlehem, and said, Go and search out exactly concerning the young child; and 
when ye have found him, bring me word, that I also may come and worship 
him. 2:9And they, having heard the king, went 
their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till 
it came and stood over where the young child was. 2:10And when they saw 
the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. 2:11And they came into 
the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and 
worshipped him; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold 
and frankincense and myrrh. 2:12And being warned of God in a 
dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country 
another way. 
2:13Now when they were departed, behold, an 
angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the 
young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell 
thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. 2:14And he arose and 
took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt; 2:15and was there until the death of Herod: 
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, 
saying, Out of Egypt did I call my son. 
2:16Then Herod, when he saw that he was 
mocked of the Wise-men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the 
male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two 
years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly learned of the 
Wise-men. 2:17Then was fulfilled that which was 
spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 
 2:18A voice was heard in Ramah, 
 Weeping and great mourning, 
 Rachel weeping for her children; 
 And she would not be comforted, because they are not. 
2:19But when Herod was dead, behold, an 
angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, 2:20Arise and take the young child and his 
mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young 
child's life. 2:21And he arose and took the young child 
and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. 2:22But when he heard 
that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was 
afraid to go thither; and being warned of God in a dream, he withdrew 
into the parts of Galilee, 2:23and came and dwelt in a city called 
Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, that 
he should be called a Nazarene. 

3:1And in those days cometh John the 
Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying, 3:2Repent ye; for the 
kingdom of heaven is at hand. 3:3For this is he that was spoken of 
through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 
 Make ye ready the way of the Lord, 
 Make his paths straight. 
3:4Now John himself had his raiment of 
camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts 
and wild honey. 3:5Then went out unto him Jerusalem, and 
all Judaea, and all the region round about the Jordan; 3:6and they were 
baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. 3:7But when he saw many 
of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, Ye 
offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 3:8Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of 
repentance: 3:9and think not to say within yourselves, 
We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these 
stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 3:10And even now the 
axe lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth 
good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 3:11I indeed baptize 
you in water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, 
whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and 
in fire: 3:12whose fan is in his hand, and he will 
thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor; and he will gather his wheat into the 
garner, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire. 
3:13Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the 
Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 3:14But John would have hindered him, 
saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? 3:15But Jesus answering said unto him, 
Suffer it now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then 
he suffereth him. 3:16And Jesus when he was baptized, went up 
straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw 
the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him; 3:17and lo, a voice out 
of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 


4:1Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into 
the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. 4:2And when he had 
fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered. 4:3And the tempter came 
and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become 
bread. 4:4But he answered and said, It is written, 
Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the 
mouth of God. 4:5Then the devil taketh him into the holy 
city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple, 4:6and saith unto him, 
If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, 
 He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: 
and, 
 On their hands they shall bear thee up, 
 Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
4:7Jesus said unto him, Again it is 
written, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God. 4:8Again, the devil 
taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of 
the world, and the glory of them; 4:9and he said unto him, All these things 
will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. 4:10Then saith Jesus 
unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord 
thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 4:11Then the devil leaveth him; and behold, 
angels came and ministered unto him. 
4:12Now when he heard that John was 
delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee; 4:13and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt 
in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali: 4:14that it might be fulfilled which was 
spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
 4:15The land of Zebulun and the land of 
Naphtali, 
 Toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, 
 Galilee of the Gentiles, 
 4:16The people that sat in darkness 
 Saw a great light, 
 And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death, 
 To them did light spring up. 
4:17From that time began Jesus to preach, 
and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
4:18And walking by the sea of Galilee, he 
saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a 
net into the sea; for they were fishers. 4:19And he saith unto them, Come ye after 
me, and I will make you fishers of men. 4:20And they straightway left the nets, and 
followed him. 4:21And going on from thence he saw two 
other brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the 
boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. 4:22And they straightway left the boat and 
their father, and followed him. 
4:23And Jesus went about in all Galilee, 
teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and 
healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people. 4:24And the report of him went forth into 
all Syria: and they brought unto him all that were sick, holden with divers 
diseases and torments, possessed with demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he 
healed them. 4:25And there followed him great multitudes 
from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from beyond the 
Jordan. 


5:1And seeing the multitudes, he went up 
into the mountain: and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him: 5:2and 
he opened his mouth and taught them, saying, 
5:3Blessed are the poor in spirit: for 
theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
5:4Blessed are they that mourn: for they 
shall be comforted. 
5:5Blessed are the meek: for they shall 
inherit the earth. 
5:6Blessed are they that hunger and thirst 
after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 
5:7Blessed are the merciful: for they shall 
obtain mercy. 
5:8Blessed are the pure in heart: for they 
shall see God. 
5:9Blessed are the peacemakers: for they 
shall be called sons of God. 
5:10Blessed are they that have been 
persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 5:11Blessed are ye when men shall 
reproach you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, 
for my sake. 5:12Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for 
great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets that were 
before you. 
5:13Ye are the salt of the earth: but if 
the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth 
good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men. 5:14Ye 
are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. 5:15Neither do men light a lamp, and 
put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in 
the house. 5:16Even so let your light shine before 
men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in 
heaven. 
5:17Think not that I came to destroy the 
law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil. 5:18For verily I say 
unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no 
wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished. 5:19Whosoever therefore shall break one of 
these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the 
kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called 
great in the kingdom of heaven. 5:20For I say unto you, that except your 
righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and 
Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
5:21Ye have heard that it was said to them 
of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of 
the judgment: 5:22but I say unto you, that every one who 
is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever 
shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever 
shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire. 5:23If 
therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that 
thy brother hath aught against thee, 5:24leave there thy gift before the altar, 
and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy 
gift. 5:25Agree with thine adversary quickly, 
while thou art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the 
judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. 
5:26Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by 
no means come out thence, till thou have paid the last farthing. 
5:27Ye have heard that it was said, Thou 
shalt not commit adultery: 5:28but I say unto you, that every one that 
looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in 
his heart. 5:29And if thy right eye causeth thee to 
stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that 
one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell. 5:30And if thy right hand causeth thee to 
stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that 
one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go into hell. 5:31It 
was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of 
divorcement: 5:32but I say unto you, that every one that 
putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an 
adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth 
adultery. 
5:33Again, ye have heard that it was said 
to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the 
Lord thine oaths: 5:34but I say unto you, swear not at all; 
neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God; 5:35nor by the earth, 
for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the 
great King. 5:36Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, 
for thou canst not make one hair white or black. 5:37But let your speech 
be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil 
one. 
5:38Ye have heard that it was said, An eye 
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 5:39but I say unto you, resist not him that 
is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other 
also. 5:40And if any man would go to law with 
thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. 5:41And whosoever shall 
compel thee to go one mile, go with him two. 5:42Give to him that 
asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. 
5:43Ye have heard that it was said, Thou 
shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy: 5:44but I say unto you, 
love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you; 5:45that ye may be sons 
of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and 
the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. 5:46For if ye love them 
that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? 5:47And if ye salute your brethren only, 
what do ye more than others? do not even the Gentiles the same? 5:48Ye 
therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. 

6:1Take heed that ye do not your 
righteousness before men, to be seen of them: else ye have no reward with your 
Father who is in heaven. 6:2When therefore thou doest alms, sound 
not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the 
streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have 
received their reward. 6:3But when thou doest alms, let not thy 
left hand know what thy right hand doeth: 6:4that thine alms may be in secret: and 
thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee. 
6:5And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the 
hypocrites: for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners 
of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have 
received their reward. 6:6But thou, when thou prayest, enter into 
thine inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in 
secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee. 6:7And 
in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they think that 
they shall be heard for their much speaking. 6:8Be not therefore 
like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye 
ask him. 6:9After this manner therefore pray ye. Our 
Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. 6:10Thy kingdom come. 
Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth. 6:11Give us this day 
our daily bread. 6:12And forgive us our debts, as we also 
have forgiven our debtors. 6:13And bring us not into temptation, but 
deliver us from the evil one. 6:14For if ye forgive men their trespasses, 
your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 6:15But if ye forgive 
not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. 
6:16Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the 
hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may 
be seen of men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward. 
6:17But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy 
head, and wash thy face; 6:18that thou be not seen of men to fast, 
but of thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall 
recompense thee. 
6:19Lay not up for yourselves treasures 
upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and 
steal: 6:20but lay up for yourselves treasures in 
heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do not break 
through nor steal: 6:21for where thy treasure is, there will 
thy heart be also. 6:22The lamp of the body is the eye: if 
therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. 6:23But if thine eye be evil, thy whole 
body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be 
darkness, how great is the darkness! 6:24No man can serve two masters; for 
either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, 
and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. 6:25Therefore I say 
unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall 
drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than 
the food, and the body than the raiment? 6:26Behold the birds of the heaven, that 
they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly 
Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value then they? 6:27And which of you by being anxious can 
add one cubit unto the measure of his life? 6:28And why are ye 
anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; 
they toil not, neither do they spin: 6:29yet I say unto you, that even Solomon 
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 6:30But if God doth so 
clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the 
oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? 6:31Be 
not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, 
Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 6:32For after all these things do the 
Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these 
things. 6:33But seek ye first his kingdom, and his 
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. 6:34Be not therefore 
anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient 
unto the day is the evil thereof. 

7:1Judge not, that ye be not judged. 7:2For 
with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, 
it shall be measured unto you. 7:3And why beholdest thou the mote that is 
in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 7:4Or 
how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye; and 
lo, the beam is in thine own eye? 7:5Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam 
out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out 
of thy brother's eye. 
7:6Give not that which is holy unto the 
dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine, lest haply they trample them 
under their feet, and turn and rend you. 
7:7Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, 
and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: 7:8for every one that 
asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall 
be opened. 7:9Or what man is there of you, who, if his 
son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone; 7:10or if he shall ask 
for a fish, will give him a serpent? 7:11If ye then, being evil, know how to 
give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in 
heaven give good things to them that ask him? 7:12All things 
therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye also 
unto them: for this is the law and the prophets. 
7:13Enter ye in by the narrow gate: for 
wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many 
are they that enter in thereby. 7:14For narrow is the gate, and straitened 
the way, that leadeth unto life, and few are they that find it. 
7:15Beware of false prophets, who come to 
you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves. 7:16By their fruits ye 
shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? 7:17Even so every good tree bringeth forth 
good fruit; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 7:18A good tree cannot 
bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. 7:19Every tree that bringeth not forth good 
fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 7:20Therefore by their 
fruits ye shall know them. 7:21Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, 
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my 
Father who is in heaven. 7:22Many will say to me in that day, Lord, 
Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out demons, and by 
thy name do many mighty works? 7:23And then will I profess unto them, I 
never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. 
7:24Every one therefore that heareth these 
words of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, who built his 
house upon the rock: 7:25and the rain descended, and the floods 
came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and if fell not: for it was 
founded upon the rock. 7:26And every one that heareth these words 
of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his 
house upon the sand: 7:27and the rain descended, and the floods 
came, and the winds blew, and smote upon that house; and it fell: and great was 
the fall thereof. 
7:28And it came to pass, when Jesus had 
finished these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching: 7:29for he taught them as one having 
authority, and not as their scribes. 

8:1And when he was come down from the 
mountain, great multitudes followed him. 8:2And behold, there came to him a leper 
and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 8:3And 
he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made 
clean. And straightway his leprosy was cleansed. 8:4And Jesus saith unto 
him, See thou tell no man; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer the 
gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 
8:5And when he was entered into Capernaum, 
there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, 8:6and saying, Lord, my 
servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. 8:7And 
he saith unto him, I will come and heal him. 8:8And the centurion 
answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof; 
but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed. 8:9For I also am a man 
under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he 
goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he 
doeth it. 8:10And when Jesus heard it, he marvelled, 
and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great 
faith, no, not in Israel. 8:11And I say unto you, that many shall 
come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and 
Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: 8:12but the sons of the kingdom shall be 
cast forth into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing 
of teeth. 8:13And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go 
thy way; as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And the servant 
was healed in that hour. 
8:14And when Jesus was come into Peter's 
house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever. 8:15And he touched her 
hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and ministered unto him. 8:16And when even was come, they brought 
unto him many possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with a word, 
and healed all that were sick: 8:17that it might be fulfilled which was 
spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: Himself took our infirmities, and 
bare our diseases. 
8:18Now when Jesus saw great multitudes 
about him, he gave commandments to depart unto the other side. 8:19And there came a scribe, and said unto 
him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. 8:20And Jesus saith 
unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests; 
but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. 8:21And another of the 
disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. 8:22But Jesus saith unto him, Follow me; 
and leave the dead to bury their own dead. 
8:23And when he was entered into a boat, 
his disciples followed him. 8:24And behold, there arose a great tempest 
in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was 
asleep. 8:25And they came to him, and awoke him, 
saying, Save, Lord; we perish. 8:26And he saith unto them, Why are ye 
fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; 
and there was a great calm. 8:27And the men marvelled, saying, What 
manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him? 
8:28And when he was come to the other side 
into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with demons, 
coming forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by 
that way. 8:29And behold, they cried out, saying, 
What have we to do with thee, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment 
us before the time? 8:30Now there was afar off from them a herd 
of many swine feeding. 8:31And the demons besought him, saying, If 
thou cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine. 8:32And he said unto 
them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine: and behold, the whole herd 
rushed down the steep into the sea, and perished in the waters. 8:33And they that fed them fled, and went 
away into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to them that were 
possessed with demons. 8:34And behold, all the city came out to 
meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart 
from their borders. 

9:1And he entered into a boat, and crossed 
over, and came into his own city. 9:2And behold, they brought to him a man 
sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the 
sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven. 9:3And 
behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. 9:4And 
Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? 9:5For 
which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk? 9:6But 
that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins 
(then saith he to the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go up 
unto thy house. 9:7And he arose, and departed to his house. 
9:8But when the multitudes saw it, they 
were afraid, and glorified God, who had given such authority unto men. 
9:9And as Jesus passed by from thence, he 
saw a man, called Matthew, sitting at the place of toll: and he saith unto him, 
Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. 
9:10And it came to pass, as he sat at meat 
in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus 
and his disciples. 9:11And when the Pharisees saw it, they 
said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Teacher with the publicans and sinners? 
9:12But when he heard it, he said, They 
that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. 9:13But go ye and learn what this 
meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the 
righteous, but sinners. 
9:14Then come to him the disciples of John, 
saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? 9:15And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons 
of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days 
will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they 
fast. 9:16And no man putteth a piece of undressed 
cloth upon an old garment; for that which should fill it up taketh from the 
garment, and a worse rent is made. 9:17Neither do men put new wine into 
old wine-skins: else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins 
perish: but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins, and both are preserved. 
9:18While he spake these things unto them, 
behold, there came a ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now 
dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. 9:19And Jesus arose, and followed him, and 
so did his disciples. 9:20And behold, a woman, who had an issue 
of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: 
9:21for she said within herself, If I do 
but touch his garment, I shall be made whole. 9:22But Jesus turning 
and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; thy faith hath made thee whole. 
And the woman was made whole from that hour. 9:23And when Jesus came 
into the ruler's house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a 
tumult, 9:24he said, Give place: for the damsel is 
not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. 9:25But when the crowd 
was put forth, he entered in, and took her by the hand; and the damsel arose. 9:26And the fame hereof went forth into all 
that land. 
9:27And as Jesus passed by from thence, two 
blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, thou son of 
David. 9:28And when he was come into the house, 
the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able 
to do this? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. 9:29Then touched he 
their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done unto you. 9:30And their eyes were opened. And Jesus 
strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know it. 9:31But they went 
forth, and spread abroad his fame in all that land. 
9:32And as they went forth, behold, there 
was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon. 9:33And when the demon 
was cast out, the dumb man spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was 
never so seen in Israel. 9:34But the Pharisees said, By the prince 
of the demons casteth he out demons. 
9:35And Jesus went about all the cities and 
the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the 
kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness. 9:36But when he saw the multitudes, he was 
moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and scattered, as 
sheep not having a shepherd. 9:37Then saith he unto his disciples, The 
harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few. 9:38Pray ye therefore 
the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest. 

10:1And he called unto him his twelve 
disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and 
to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness. 
10:2Now the names of the twelve apostles 
are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James 
the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; 10:3Philip, and 
Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, 
and Thaddaeus; 10:4Simon the Cananaean, and Judas 
Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 
10:5These twelve Jesus sent forth, and 
charged them, saying, Go not into any way of the Gentiles, and enter not 
into any city of the Samaritans: 10:6but go rather to the lost sheep of the 
house of Israel. 10:7And as ye go, preach, saying, The 
kingdom of heaven is at hand. 10:8Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse 
the lepers, cast out demons: freely ye received, freely give. 10:9Get you no gold, nor silver, nor brass 
in your purses; 10:10no wallet for your journey, 
neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food. 
10:11And into whatsoever city or village ye 
shall enter, search out who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go forth. 
10:12And as ye enter into the house, salute 
it. 10:13And if the house be worthy, let your 
peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. 10:14And whosoever shall not receive you, 
nor hear your words, as ye go forth out of that house or that city, shake off 
the dust of your feet. 10:15Verily I say unto you, It shall be 
more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than 
for that city. 
10:16Behold, I send you forth as sheep in 
the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. 10:17But beware of men: for they will 
deliver you up to councils, and in theirs synagogues they will scourge you; 10:18yea and before governors and kings 
shall ye be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. 10:19But when they deliver you up, be not 
anxious how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what 
ye shall speak. 10:20For it is not ye that speak, but the 
Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you. 10:21And brother shall 
deliver up brother to death, and the father his child: and children shall rise 
up against parents, and cause them to be put to death. 10:22And ye shall be 
hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same 
shall be saved. 10:23But when they persecute you in this 
city, flee into the next: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone 
through the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come. 
10:24A disciple is not above his teacher, 
nor a servant above his lord. 10:25It is enough for the disciple that he 
be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master 
of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household! 10:26Fear them not therefore: for there is 
nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. 
10:27What I tell you in the darkness, speak 
ye in the light; and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the house-tops. 10:28And be not afraid of them that kill 
the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to 
destroy both soul and body in hell. 10:29Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? 
and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father: 10:30but the very hairs of your head are 
all numbered. 10:31Fear not therefore: ye are of more 
value than many sparrows. 10:32Every one therefore who shall confess 
me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven. 10:33But whosoever shall deny me before 
men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven. 
10:34Think not that I came to send peace on 
the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. 10:35For I came to set 
a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and 
the daughter in law against her mother in law: 10:36and a man's foes 
shall be they of his own household. 10:37He that loveth 
father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or 
daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 10:38And he that doth 
not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me. 10:39He that findeth his life shall lose 
it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. 
10:40He that receiveth you receiveth me, 
and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. 10:41He that receiveth 
a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward: and he that 
receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a 
righteous man's reward. 10:42And whosoever shall give to drink unto 
one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, 
verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward. 

11:1And it came to pass when Jesus had 
finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach 
in their cities. 11:2Now when John heard in the prison the 
works of the Christ, he sent by his disciples 11:3and said unto him, 
Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another? 11:4And Jesus answered 
and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see: 11:5the blind receive their sight, and the 
lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised 
up, and the poor have good tidings preached to them. 11:6And blessed is he, 
whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me. 
11:7And as these went their way, Jesus 
began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the 
wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind? 11:8But what went ye 
out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft 
raiment are in king's houses. 11:9But wherefore went ye out? to see a 
prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. 11:10This is he, of 
whom it is written, 
 Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, 
 Who shall prepare thy way before thee. 
11:11Verily I say unto you, Among them that 
are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: yet he 
that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 11:12And from the days of John the Baptist 
until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and men of violence take it 
by force. 11:13For all the prophets and the law 
prophesied until John. 11:14And if ye are willing to receive 
it, this is Elijah, that is to come. 11:15He that hath ears 
to hear, let him hear. 11:16But whereunto shall I liken this 
generation? It is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces, who call unto 
their fellows 11:17and say, We piped unto you, and ye did 
not dance; we wailed, and ye did not mourn. 11:18For John came 
neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon. 11:19The Son of man 
came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a 
winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! And wisdom is justified by her 
works. 
11:20Then began he to upbraid the cities 
wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not. 11:21Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto 
thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which 
were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 11:22But I say unto you, it shall be more 
tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you. 11:23And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be 
exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades: for if the mighty works had 
been done in Sodom which were done in thee, it would have remained until this 
day. 11:24But I say unto you that it shall be 
more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. 
11:25At that season Jesus answered and 
said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide 
these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: 
11:26yea, Father, for so it was 
well-pleasing in thy sight. 11:27All things have been delivered unto me 
of my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth any know 
the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal 
him. 11:28Come unto me, all ye that labor and 
are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 11:29Take my yoke upon 
you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest 
unto your souls. 11:30For my yoke is easy, and my burden is 
light. 

12:1At that season Jesus went on the 
sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began to 
pluck ears and to eat. 12:2But the Pharisees, when they saw it, 
said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon 
the sabbath. 12:3But he said unto them, Have ye not read 
what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him; 12:4how he entered into the house of God, 
and ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them 
that were with him, but only for the priests? 12:5Or have ye not read 
in the law, that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the 
sabbath, and are guiltless? 12:6But I say unto you, that one greater 
than the temple is here. 12:7But if ye had known what this meaneth, 
I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. 12:8For the Son of man is lord of the 
sabbath. 
12:9And he departed thence, and went into 
their synagogue: 12:10and behold, a man having a withered 
hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that 
they might accuse him. 12:11And he said unto them, What man shall 
there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the 
sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? 12:12How much then is a 
man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath 
day. 12:13Then saith he to the man, Stretch 
forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the 
other. 12:14But the Pharisees went out, and took 
counsel against him, how they might destroy him. 
12:15And Jesus perceiving it 
withdrew from thence: and many followed him; and he healed them all, 12:16and charged them that they should not 
make him known: 12:17that it might be fulfilled which was 
spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
 12:18Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; 

 My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: 
 I will put my Spirit upon him, 
 And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. 
 12:19He shall not strive, nor cry aloud; 
 Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets. 
 12:20A bruised reed shall he not break, 
 And smoking flax shall he not quench, 
 Till he send forth judgment unto victory. 
 12:21And in his name shall the Gentiles 
hope. 
12:22Then was brought unto him one 
possessed with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the 
dumb man spake and saw. 12:23And all the multitudes were amazed, 
and said, Can this be the son of David? 12:24But when the Pharisees heard it, they 
said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the 
demons. 12:25And knowing their thoughts he said 
unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and 
every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: 12:26and if Satan 
casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom 
stand? 12:27And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, 
by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges. 12:28But if I by the Spirit of God cast out 
demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you. 12:29Or how can one 
enter into the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he 
first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. 12:30He that is not with me is against me, 
and he that gathereth not with me scattereth. 12:31Therefore I say 
unto you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy 
against the Spirit shall not be forgiven. 12:32And whosoever 
shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but 
whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, 
neither in this world, nor in that which is to come. 12:33Either make the 
tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: 
for the tree is known by its fruit. 12:34Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, 
being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth 
speaketh. 12:35The good man out of his good treasure 
bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth 
forth evil things. 12:36And I say unto you, that every idle 
word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of 
judgment. 12:37For by thy words thou shalt be 
justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. 
12:38Then certain of the scribes and 
Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee. 12:39But he answered and said unto them, An 
evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be 
given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet: 12:40for as Jonah was 
three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man 
be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 12:41The men of Nineveh 
shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for 
they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is 
here. 12:42The queen of the south shall rise up 
in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from 
the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than 
Solomon is here. 12:43But the unclean spirit, when he is 
gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth 
it not. 12:44Then he saith, I will return into my 
house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and 
garnished. 12:45Then goeth he, and taketh with himself 
seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: 
and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. Even so shall it 
be also unto this evil generation. 
12:46While he was yet speaking to the 
multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak 
to him. 12:47And one said unto him, Behold, thy 
mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee. 12:48But he answered and said unto him that 
told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? 12:49And he stretched 
forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my 
brethren! 12:50For whosoever shall do the will of my 
Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother. 

13:1On that day went Jesus out of the 
house, and sat by the sea side. 13:2And there were gathered unto him great 
multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood 
on the beach. 13:3And he spake to them many things in 
parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow; 13:4and as he sowed, 
some seeds fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them: 13:5and others fell upon the rocky places, 
where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had 
no deepness of earth: 13:6and when the sun was risen, they were 
scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. 13:7And others fell 
upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them: 13:8and others fell 
upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some 
thirty. 13:9He that hath ears, let him hear. 
13:10And the disciples came, and said unto 
him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? 13:11And he answered 
and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of 
heaven, but to them it is not given. 13:12For whosoever hath, to him shall be 
given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be 
taken away even that which he hath. 13:13Therefore speak I to them in parables; 
because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they 
understand. 13:14And unto them is fulfilled the 
prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, 
 By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; 
 And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive: 
 13:15For this people's heart is waxed 
gross, 
 And their ears are dull of hearing, 
 And their eyes they have closed; 
 Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, 
 And hear with their ears, 
 And understand with their heart, 
 And should turn again, 
 And I should heal them. 
13:16But blessed are your eyes, for they 
see; and your ears, for they hear. 13:17For verily I say unto you, that many 
prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them 
not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not. 13:18Hear then ye the parable of the sower. 
13:19When any one heareth the word of the 
kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the evil one, and 
snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown 
by the way side. 13:20And he that was sown upon the rocky 
places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it; 
13:21yet hath he not root in himself, but 
endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the 
word, straightway he stumbleth. 13:22And he that was sown among the thorns, 
this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the 
deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 13:23And he that was sown upon the good 
ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily 
beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 
13:24Another parable set he before them, 
saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his 
field: 13:25but while men slept, his enemy came 
and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away. 13:26But when the blade 
sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 13:27And the servants of the householder 
came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence 
then hath it tares? 13:28And he said unto them, An enemy hath 
done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather 
them up? 13:29But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye 
gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them. 13:30Let both grow 
together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the 
reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but 
gather the wheat into my barn. 
13:31Another parable set he before them, 
saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man 
took, and sowed in his field: 13:32which indeed is less than all seeds; 
but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that 
the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof. 
13:33Another parable spake he unto them; 
The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three 
measures of meal, till it was all leavened. 
13:34All these things spake Jesus in 
parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them: 
13:35that it might be fulfilled which was 
spoken through the prophet, saying, 
 I will open my mouth in parables; 
 I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world. 
13:36Then he left the multitudes, and went 
into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the 
parable of the tares of the field. 13:37And he answered and said, He that 
soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 13:38and the field is the world; and the 
good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the 
evil one; 13:39and the enemy that sowed them is the 
devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels. 13:40As therefore the tares are gathered up 
and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world. 13:41The Son of man shall send forth his 
angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause 
stumbling, and them that do iniquity, 13:42and shall cast them into the furnace 
of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. 13:43Then shall the righteous shine forth 
as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear. 
13:44The kingdom of heaven is like unto a 
treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he 
goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. 
13:45Again, the kingdom of heaven is like 
unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls: 13:46and having found 
one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it. 
13:47Again, the kingdom of heaven is like 
unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: 13:48which, when it was filled, they drew 
up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the 
bad they cast away. 13:49So shall it be in the end of the 
world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the 
righteous, 13:50and shall cast them into the furnace 
of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. 
13:51Have ye understood all these things? 
They say unto him, Yea. 13:52And he said unto them, Therefore every 
scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man 
that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and 
old. 
13:53And it came to pass, when Jesus had 
finished these parables, he departed thence. 
13:54And coming into his own country he 
taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, 
Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? 13:55Is not this the 
carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and 
Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? 13:56And his sisters, are they not all with 
us? Whence then hath this man all these things? 13:57And they were 
offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save 
in his own country, and in his own house. 13:58And he did not 
many mighty works there because of their unbelief. 

14:1At that season Herod the tetrarch heard 
the report concerning Jesus, 14:2and said unto his servants, This is 
John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these powers work 
in him. 14:3For Herod had laid hold on John, and 
bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's 
wife. 14:4For John said unto him, It is not 
lawful for thee to have her. 14:5And when he would have put him to 
death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. 14:6But when Herod's birthday came, the 
daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod. 14:7Whereupon he 
promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask. 14:8And she, being put 
forward by her mother, saith, Give me here on a platter the head of John the 
Baptist. 14:9And the king was grieved; but for the 
sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat with him, he commanded it to be 
given; 14:10and he sent and beheaded John in the 
prison. 14:11And his head was brought on a platter, 
and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother. 14:12And his disciples 
came, and took up the corpse, and buried him; and they went and told Jesus. 
14:13Now when Jesus heard it, he 
withdrew from thence in a boat, to a desert place apart: and when the multitudes 
heard thereof, they followed him on foot from the cities. 14:14And he came forth, and saw a great 
multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick. 14:15And when even was come, the disciples 
came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past; send the 
multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food. 14:16But Jesus said unto them, They have no 
need to go away; give ye them to eat. 14:17And they say unto him, We have here 
but five loaves, and two fishes. 14:18And he said, Bring them hither to me. 
14:19And he commanded the multitudes to sit 
down on the grass; and he took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking 
up to heaven, he blessed, and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples, and 
the disciples to the multitudes. 14:20And they all ate, and were filled: and 
they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full. 
14:21And they that did eat were about five 
thousand men, besides women and children. 
14:22And straightway he constrained the 
disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, till 
he should send the multitudes away. 14:23And after he had sent the multitudes 
away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was 
there alone. 14:24But the boat was now in the midst of 
the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary. 14:25And in the fourth watch of the night 
he came unto them, walking upon the sea. 14:26And when the 
disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; 
and they cried out for fear. 14:27But straightway Jesus spake unto them, 
saying Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. 14:28And Peter answered 
him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto the upon the waters. 14:29And he said, Come. And Peter went down 
from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus. 14:30But when he saw 
the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save 
me. 14:31And immediately Jesus stretched forth 
his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, 
wherefore didst thou doubt? 14:32And when they were gone up into the 
boat, the wind ceased. 14:33And they that were in the boat 
worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. 
14:34And when they had crossed over, they 
came to the land, unto Gennesaret. 14:35And when the men of that place knew 
him, they sent into all that region round about, and brought unto him all that 
were sick, 14:36and they besought him that they might 
only touch the border of his garment: and as many as touched were made whole. 

15:1Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem 
Pharisees and scribes, saying, 15:2Why do thy disciples transgress the 
tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 15:3And he answered and said unto them, Why 
do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 15:4For God said, Honor thy father and thy 
mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death. 
15:5But ye say, whosoever shall say to his 
father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is 
given to God; 15:6he shall not honor his father. And ye 
have made void the word of God because of your tradition. 15:7Ye hypocrites, well 
did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, 
 15:8This people honoreth me with their 
lips; 
 But their heart is far from me. 
 15:9But in vain do they worship me, 
 Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men. 
15:10And he called to him the multitude, 
and said unto them, Hear, and understand: 15:11Not that which 
entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the 
mouth, this defileth the man. 15:12Then came the disciples, and said unto 
him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying? 
15:13But he answered and said, Every plant 
which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up. 15:14Let them alone: 
they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a 
pit. 15:15And Peter answered and said unto him, 
Declare unto us the parable. 15:16And he said, Are ye also even yet 
without understanding? 15:17Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth 
into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? 15:18But the things which proceed out of 
the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man. 15:19For out of the heart come forth evil 
thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings: 15:20these are the things which defile the 
man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man. 
15:21And Jesus went out thence, and 
withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon. 15:22And behold, a 
Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on 
me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon. 15:23But he answered her not a word. And 
his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after 
us. 15:24But he answered and said, I was not 
sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 15:25But she came and 
worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. 15:26And he answered and said, It is not 
meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. 15:27But she said, Yea, 
Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. 
15:28Then Jesus answered and said unto her, 
O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her 
daughter was healed from that hour. 
15:29And Jesus departed thence, and came 
nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there. 
15:30And there came unto him great 
multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and 
they cast them down at this feet; and he healed them: 15:31insomuch that the 
multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and lame 
walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel. 
15:32And Jesus called unto him his 
disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue 
with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away 
fasting, lest haply they faint on the way. 15:33And the disciples 
say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill 
so great a multitude? 15:34And Jesus said unto them, How many 
loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes. 15:35And he commanded the multitude to sit 
down on the ground; 15:36and he took the seven loaves and the 
fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the 
disciples to the multitudes. 15:37And they all ate, and were filled: and 
they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full. 
15:38And they that did eat were four 
thousand men, besides women and children. 15:39And he sent away 
the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan. 


16:1And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, 
and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven. 16:2But he answered and 
said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for 
the heaven is red. 16:3And in the morning, It will be 
foul weather to-day: for the heaven is red and lowering. Ye know how to discern 
the face of the heaven; but ye cannot discern the signs of the times. 16:4An 
evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be 
given unto it, but the sign of Jonah. And he left them, and departed. 
16:5And the disciples came to the other 
side and forgot to take bread. 16:6And Jesus said unto them, Take heed and 
beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 16:7And they reasoned 
among themselves, saying, We took no bread. 16:8And Jesus 
perceiving it said, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, 
because ye have no bread? 16:9Do ye not yet perceive, neither 
remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? 
16:10Neither the seven loaves of the four 
thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? 16:11How is it that ye 
do not perceive that I spake not to you concerning bread? But beware of the 
leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 16:12Then understood they that he bade them 
not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and 
Sadducees. 
16:13Now when Jesus came into the parts of 
Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son 
of man is? 16:14And they said, Some say John 
the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. 16:15He saith unto them, But who say ye 
that I am? 16:16And Simon Peter answered and said, 
Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 16:17And Jesus answered 
and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for flesh and blood hath 
not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven. 16:18And I also say 
unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and 
the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. 16:19I will give unto 
thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth 
shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be 
loosed in heaven. 16:20Then charged he the disciples that 
they should tell no man that he was the Christ. 
16:21From that time began Jesus to show 
unto his disciples, that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of 
the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be 
raised up. 16:22And Peter took him, and began to 
rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall never be unto thee. 16:23But he turned, and said unto Peter, 
Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art a stumbling-block unto me: for thou mindest 
not the things of God, but the things of men. 16:24Then said Jesus 
unto his disciples, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and 
take up his cross, and follow me. 16:25For whosoever would save his life 
shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it. 16:26For what shall a man be profited, if 
he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? or what shall a man give in 
exchange for his life? 16:27For the Son of man shall come in the 
glory of his Father with his angels; and then shall he render unto every man 
according to his deeds. 16:28Verily I say unto you, there are some 
of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the 
Son of man coming in his kingdom. 

17:1And after six days Jesus taketh with 
him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high 
mountain apart: 17:2and he was transfigured before them; 
and his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light. 
17:3And behold, there appeared unto them 
Moses and Elijah talking with him. 17:4And Peter answered, and said unto 
Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, I will make here three 
tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. 17:5While he was yet speaking, behold, a 
bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, 
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. 17:6And when the disciples heard it, they 
fell on their face, and were sore afraid. 17:7And Jesus came and 
touched them and said, Arise, and be not afraid. 17:8And lifting up 
their eyes, they saw no one, save Jesus only. 
17:9And as they were coming down from the 
mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son 
of man be risen from the dead. 17:10And his disciples asked him, saying, 
Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come? 17:11And he answered 
and said, Elijah indeed cometh, and shall restore all things: 17:12but I say into you, that Elijah is 
come already, and they knew him not, but did unto him whatsoever they would. 
Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them. 17:13Then understood 
the disciples that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. 
17:14And when they were come to the 
multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, saying, 17:15Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is 
epileptic, and suffereth grievously; for oft-times he falleth into the fire, and 
off-times into the water. 17:16And I brought him to thy disciples, 
and they could not cure him. 17:17And Jesus answered and said, O 
faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall 
I bear with you? bring him hither to me. 17:18And Jesus rebuked 
him; and the demon went out of him: and the boy was cured from that hour. 
17:19Then came the disciples to Jesus 
apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out? 17:20And he saith unto 
them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith 
as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to 
yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. 17:21But this kind goeth not out save by 
prayer and fasting.
17:22And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus 
said unto them, The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men; 17:23and they shall kill him, and the third 
day he shall be raised up. And they were exceeding sorry. 
17:24And when they were come to Capernaum, 
they that received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your 
teacher pay the half-shekel? 17:25He saith, Yea. And when he came into 
the house, Jesus spake first to him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? the 
kings of the earth, from whom do they receive toll or tribute? from their sons, 
or from strangers? 17:26And when he said, From strangers, 
Jesus said unto him, Therefore the sons are free. 17:27But, lest we cause 
them to stumble, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that 
first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a shekel: 
that take, and give unto them for me and thee. 

18:1In that hour came the disciples unto 
Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 18:2And he called to him a little child, 
and set him in the midst of them, 18:3and said, Verily I say unto you, Except 
ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the 
kingdom of heaven. 18:4Whosoever therefore shall humble 
himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
18:5And whoso shall receive one such little 
child in my name receiveth me: 18:6But whoso shall cause one of these 
little ones that believe on me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great 
millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be sunk in 
the depth of the sea. 
18:7Woe unto the world because of occasions 
of stumbling! for it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe to that man 
through whom the occasion cometh! 18:8And if thy hand or thy foot causeth 
thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter 
into life maimed or halt, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast 
into the eternal fire. 18:9And if thine eye causeth thee to 
stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into 
life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire. 
18:10See that ye despise not one of these 
little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold 
the face of my Father who is in heaven. 18:11For the Son of man came to save 
that which was lost. 18:12How think ye? if any man have a 
hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and 
nine, and go unto the mountains, and seek that which goeth astray? 18:13And if so be that he find it, verily I 
say unto you, he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which have 
not gone astray. 18:14Even so it is not the will of your 
Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. 
18:15And if thy brother sin against thee, 
go, show him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast 
gained thy brother. 18:16But if he hear thee not, take 
with thee one or two more, that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every 
word may be established. 18:17And if he refuse to hear them, tell it 
unto the church: and if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be unto thee 
as the Gentile and the publican. 18:18Verily I say unto you, what things 
soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever 
ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 18:19Again I say unto 
you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they 
shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father who is in heaven. 18:20For where two or three are gathered 
together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. 
18:21Then came Peter and said to him, Lord, 
how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times? 
18:22Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto 
thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven. 18:23Therefore is the 
kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, who would make a reckoning with 
his servants. 18:24And when he had begun to reckon, one 
was brought unto him, that owed him ten thousand talents. 18:25But forasmuch as 
he had not wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his 
wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. 18:26The servant therefore fell down and 
worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. 18:27And the lord of that servant, being 
moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt. 18:28But that servant went out, and found 
one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred shillings: and he laid hold 
on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay what thou owest. 18:29So his fellow-servant fell down and 
besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee. 18:30And he would not: but went and cast 
him into prison, till he should pay that which was due. 18:31So when his 
fellow-servants saw what was done, they were exceeding sorry, and came and told 
unto their lord all that was done. 18:32Then his lord called him unto him, and 
saith to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou 
besoughtest me: 18:33shouldest not thou also have had mercy 
on thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on thee? 18:34And his lord was 
wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due. 
18:35So shall also my heavenly Father do 
unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts. 

19:1And it came to pass when Jesus had 
finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of 
Judaea beyond the Jordan; 19:2and great multitudes followed him; and 
he healed them there. 
19:3And there came unto him Pharisees, 
trying him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for 
every cause? 19:4And he answered and said, Have ye not 
read, that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female, 
19:5and said, For this cause shall a man 
leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall 
become one flesh? 19:6So that they are no more two, but one 
flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. 19:7They say unto him, Why then did Moses 
command to give a bill of divorcement, and to put her away? 19:8He 
saith unto them, Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your 
wives: but from the beginning it hath not been so. 19:9And I say unto you, 
Whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry 
another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her when she is put away 
committeth adultery. 19:10The disciples say unto him, If the 
case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry. 19:11But he said unto them, Not all men can 
receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. 19:12For there are 
eunuchs, that were so born from their mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, that 
were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, that made themselves eunuchs 
for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive 
it. 
19:13Then were there brought unto him 
little children, that he should lay his hands on them, and pray: and the 
disciples rebuked them. 19:14But Jesus said, Suffer the little 
children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for to such belongeth the 
kingdom of heaven. 19:15And he laid his hands on them, and 
departed thence. 
19:16And behold, one came to him and said, 
Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 19:17And he said unto him, Why askest thou 
me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good: but if thou wouldest 
enter into life, keep the commandments. 19:18He saith unto him, Which? And Jesus 
said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, 
Thou shalt not bear false witness, 19:19Honor thy father and mother; and, Thou 
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 19:20The young man saith unto him, All 
these things have I observed: what lack I yet? 19:21Jesus said unto 
him, If thou wouldest be perfect, go, sell that which thou hast, and give to the 
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. 19:22But when the young man heard the 
saying, he went away sorrowful; for he was one that had great possessions. 
19:23And Jesus said unto his disciples, 
Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of 
heaven. 19:24And again I say unto you, It is easier 
for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the 
kingdom of God. 19:25And when the disciples heard it, they 
were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then can be saved? 19:26And Jesus looking 
upon them said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all 
things are possible. 19:27Then answered Peter and said unto him, 
Lo, we have left all, and followed thee; what then shall we have? 19:28And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say 
unto you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man 
shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, 
judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 19:29And every one that hath left houses, 
or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my 
name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life. 19:30But many shall be last that are 
first; and first that are last. 

20:1For the kingdom of heaven is like unto 
a man that was a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers 
into his vineyard. 20:2And when he had agreed with the 
laborers for a shilling a day, he sent them into his vineyard. 20:3And he went out about the third hour, 
and saw others standing in the marketplace idle; 20:4and to them he 
said, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And 
they went their way. 20:5Again he went out about the sixth and 
the ninth hour, and did likewise. 20:6And about the eleventh hour he 
went out, and found others standing; and he saith unto them, Why stand ye here 
all the day idle? 20:7They say unto him, Because no man hath 
hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard. 20:8And when even was 
come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and 
pay them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. 20:9And when they came 
that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a 
shilling. 20:10And when the first came, they supposed 
that they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a shilling. 
20:11And when they received it, they 
murmured against the householder, 20:12saying, These last have spent 
but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who have borne the 
burden of the day and the scorching heat. 20:13But he answered 
and said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with 
me for a shilling? 20:14Take up that which is thine, and go 
thy way; it is my will to give unto this last, even as unto thee. 20:15Is it not lawful for me to do what I 
will with mine own? or is thine eye evil, because I am good? 20:16So the last shall be first, and the 
first last. 
20:17And as Jesus was going up to 
Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said unto them, 
20:18Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the 
Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes; and they shall 
condemn him to death, 20:19and shall deliver him unto the 
Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall be 
raised up. 
20:20Then came to him the mother of the 
sons of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping him, and asking a certain 
thing of him. 20:21And he said unto her, What wouldest 
thou? She saith unto him, Command that these my two sons may sit, one on thy 
right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy kingdom. 20:22But Jesus answered 
and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about 
to drink? They say unto him, We are able. 20:23He saith unto 
them, My cup indeed ye shall drink: but to sit on my right hand, and on 
my left hand, is not mine to give; but it is for them for whom it 
hath been prepared of my Father. 20:24And when the ten heard it, they were 
moved with indignation concerning the two brethren. 20:25But Jesus called 
them unto him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over 
them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. 20:26Not so shall it be 
among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister; 20:27and whosoever would be first among you 
shall be your servant: 20:28even as the Son of man came not to be 
ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. 
20:29And as they went out from Jericho, a 
great multitude followed him. 20:30And behold, two blind men sitting by 
the way side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, 
Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David. 20:31And the multitude 
rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried out the more, 
saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David. 20:32And Jesus stood 
still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do unto you? 20:33They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes 
may be opened. 20:34And Jesus, being moved with 
compassion, touched their eyes; and straightway they received their sight, and 
followed him. 

21:1And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, 
and came unto Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two 
disciples, 21:2saying unto them, Go into the village 
that is over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt 
with her: loose them, and bring them unto me. 21:3And if any one say 
aught unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he 
will send them. 21:4Now this is come to pass, that it might 
be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, 
 21:5Tell ye the daughter of Zion, 
 Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, 
 Meek, and riding upon an ass, 
 And upon a colt the foal of an ass. 
21:6And the disciples went, and did even as 
Jesus appointed them, 21:7and brought the ass, and the colt, and 
put on them their garments; and he sat thereon. 21:8And the most part 
of the multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut branches from 
the trees, and spread them in the way. 21:9And the multitudes that went before 
him, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed 
is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest. 21:10And when he was come into Jerusalem, 
all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this? 21:11And the multitudes 
said, This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee. 
21:12And Jesus entered into the temple of 
God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the 
tables of he money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves; 21:13and he saith unto them, It is written, 
My house shall be called a house of prayer: but ye make it a den of robbers. 21:14And the blind and the lame came to him 
in the temple; and he healed them. 21:15But when the chief priests and the 
scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children that were crying 
in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were moved with 
indignation, 21:16and said unto him, Hearest thou what 
these are saying? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea: did ye never read, Out of the 
mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise? 21:17And he left them, 
and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there. 
21:18Now in the morning as he returned to 
the city, he hungered. 21:19And seeing a fig tree by the way side, 
he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith unto it, 
Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig 
tree withered away. 21:20And when the disciples saw it, they 
marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away? 21:21And Jesus answered and said unto them, 
Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do 
what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be 
thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done. 21:22And all things, 
whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. 
21:23And when he was come into the temple, 
the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, 
and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this 
authority? 21:24And Jesus answered and said unto them, 
I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you 
by what authority I do these things. 21:25The baptism of John, whence was it? 
from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall 
say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him? 21:26But if we shall say, From men; we fear 
the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet. 21:27And they answered 
Jesus, and said, We know not. He also said unto them, Neither tell I you by what 
authority I do these things. 21:28But what think ye? A man had two sons; 
and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in the vineyard. 21:29And he answered and said, I will not: 
but afterward he repented himself, and went. 21:30And he came to the 
second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went 
not. 21:31Which of the two did the will of his 
father? They say, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that 
the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. 21:32For John came unto you in the way of 
righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots 
believed him: and ye, when ye saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, 
that ye might believe him. 
21:33Hear another parable: There was a man 
that was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and 
digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and 
went into another country. 21:34And when the season of the fruits drew 
near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits. 21:35And the husbandmen took his servants, 
and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. 21:36Again, he sent 
other servants more than the first: and they did unto them in like manner. 21:37But afterward he sent unto them his 
son, saying, They will reverence my son. 21:38But the 
husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; 
come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance. 21:39And they took him, 
and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. 21:40When therefore the 
lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen? 21:41They say unto him, He will miserably 
destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other 
husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons. 21:42Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never 
read in the scriptures, 
 The stone which the builders rejected, 
 The same was made the head of the corner; 
 This was from the Lord, 
 And it is marvelous in our eyes? 
21:43Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom 
of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing 
forth the fruits thereof. 21:44And he that falleth on this stone 
shall be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him 
as dust. 21:45And when the chief priests and the 
Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. 21:46And when they sought to lay hold on 
him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet. 

22:1And Jesus answered and spake again in 
parables unto them, saying, 22:2The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a 
certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son, 22:3and sent forth his 
servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not 
come. 22:4Again he sent forth other servants, 
saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen 
and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage 
feast. 22:5But they made light of it, and went 
their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise; 22:6and the rest laid 
hold on his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them. 22:7But the king was wroth; and he sent his 
armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. 22:8Then saith he to his servants, The 
wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy. 22:9Go ye therefore 
unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the 
marriage feast. 22:10And those servants went out into the 
highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: 
and the wedding was filled with guests. 22:11But when the king came in to behold 
the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment: 22:12and he saith unto him, Friend, how 
camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless. 22:13Then the king said to the servants, 
Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be 
the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. 22:14For many are called, but few chosen. 
22:15Then went the Pharisees, and took 
counsel how they might ensnare him in his talk. 22:16And they send to 
him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art 
true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou 
regardest not the person of men. 22:17Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? 
Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 22:18But Jesus 
perceived their wickedness, and said, Why make ye trial of me, ye hypocrites? 22:19Show me the tribute money. And they 
brought unto him a denarius. 22:20And he saith unto them, Whose is this 
image and superscription? 22:21They say unto him, Caesar's. Then 
saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; 
and unto God the things that are God's. 22:22And when they heard it, they 
marvelled, and left him, and went away. 
22:23On that day there came to him 
Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him, 22:24saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man 
die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed 
unto his brother. 22:25Now there were with us seven brethren: 
and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife unto his 
brother; 22:26in like manner the second also, and 
the third, unto the seventh. 22:27And after them all, the woman died. 22:28In the resurrection therefore whose 
wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her. 22:29But Jesus answered 
and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. 
22:30For in the resurrection they neither 
marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven. 22:31But as touching the resurrection of 
the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, 22:32I am the God of Abraham, and the God 
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of 
the living. 22:33And when the multitudes heard it, they 
were astonished at his teaching. 
22:34But the Pharisees, when they heard 
that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together. 22:35And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a 
question, trying him: 22:36Teacher, which is the great 
commandment in the law? 22:37And he said unto him, Thou shalt love 
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy 
mind. 22:38This is the great and first 
commandment. 22:39And a second like unto it is 
this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 22:40On these two 
commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets. 
22:41Now while the Pharisees were gathered 
together, Jesus asked them a question, 22:42saying, What think ye of the Christ? 
whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David. 22:43He saith unto them, How then doth 
David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying, 
 22:44The Lord said unto my Lord, 
 Sit thou on my right hand, 
 Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet? 
22:45If David then calleth him Lord, how is 
he his son? 22:46And no one was able to answer him a 
word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions. 

23:1Then spake Jesus to the multitudes and 
to his disciples, 23:2saying, The scribes and the Pharisees 
sit on Moses seat: 23:3all things therefore whatsoever they 
bid you, these do and observe: but do not ye after their works; for they 
say, and do not. 23:4Yea, they bind heavy burdens and 
grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will 
not move them with their finger. 23:5But all their works they do to be seen 
of men: for they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of 
their garments, 23:6and love the chief place at feasts, and 
the chief seats in the synagogues, 23:7and the salutations in the 
marketplaces, and to be called of men, Rabbi. 23:8But be not ye 
called Rabbi: for one is your teacher, and all ye are brethren. 23:9And call no man your father on the 
earth: for one is your Father, even he who is in heaven. 23:10Neither be ye called masters: for one 
is your master, even the Christ. 23:11But he that is greatest among you 
shall be your servant. 23:12And whosoever shall exalt himself 
shall be humbled; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted. 
23:13But woe unto you, scribes and 
Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye 
enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering in to 
enter. 23:14Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, 
hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, even while for a pretence ye make long 
prayers: therefore ye shall receive greater condemnation. 
23:15Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, 
hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is 
become so, ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves. 
23:16Woe unto you, ye blind guides, that 
say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall 
swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor. 23:17Ye fools and 
blind: for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the 
gold? 23:18And, Whosoever shall swear by the 
altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, he 
is a debtor. 23:19Ye blind: for which is greater, the 
gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? 23:20He therefore that 
sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon. 23:21And he that sweareth by the temple, 
sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein. 23:22And he that 
sweareth by the heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth 
thereon. 
23:23Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, 
hypocrites! for ye tithe mint and anise and cummin, and have left undone the 
weightier matters of the law, justice, and mercy, and faith: but these ye ought 
to have done, and not to have left the other undone. 23:24Ye blind guides, 
that strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel! 
23:25Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, 
hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within 
they are full from extortion and excess. 23:26Thou blind 
Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the 
outside thereof may become clean also. 
23:27Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, 
hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear 
beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. 23:28Even so ye also outwardly appear 
righteous unto men, but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. 
23:29Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, 
hypocrites! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and garnish the tombs 
of the righteous, 23:30and say, If we had been in the days of 
our fathers, we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the 
prophets. 23:31Wherefore ye witness to yourselves, 
that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets. 23:32Fill ye up then 
the measure of your fathers. 23:33Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers, 
how shall ye escape the judgment of hell? 23:34Therefore, behold, 
I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: some of them shall ye kill 
and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute 
from city to city: 23:35that upon you may come all the 
righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous unto the 
blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the 
altar. 23:36Verily I say unto you, All these 
things shall come upon this generation. 
23:37O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth 
the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have 
gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her 
wings, and ye would not! 23:38Behold, your house is left unto you 
desolate. 23:39For I say unto you, Ye shall not see 
me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name 
of the Lord. 

24:1And Jesus went out from the temple, and 
was going on his way; and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of 
the temple. 24:2But he answered and said unto them, See 
ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one 
stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. 
24:3And as he sat on the mount of Olives, 
the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things 
be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the 
world? 24:4And Jesus answered and said unto them, 
Take heed that no man lead you astray. 24:5For many shall come in my name, saying, 
I am the Christ; and shall lead many astray. 24:6And ye shall hear 
of wars and rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled: for these things 
must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet. 24:7For nation shall 
rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines and 
earthquakes in divers places. 24:8But all these things are the beginning 
of travail. 24:9Then shall they deliver you up unto 
tribulation, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my 
name's sake. 24:10And then shall many stumble, and shall 
deliver up one another, and shall hate one another. 24:11And many false 
prophets shall arise, and shall lead many astray. 24:12And because 
iniquity shall be multiplied, the love of the many shall wax cold. 24:13But he that endureth to the end, the 
same shall be saved. 24:14And this gospel of the kingdom shall 
be preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations; and then 
shall the end come. 
24:15When therefore ye see the abomination 
of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the 
holy place (let him that readeth understand), 24:16then let them that 
are in Judaea flee unto the mountains: 24:17let him that is on the housetop not go 
down to take out things that are in his house: 24:18and let him that 
is in the field not return back to take his cloak. 24:19But woe unto them 
that are with child and to them that give suck in those days! 24:20And pray ye that your flight be not in 
the winter, neither on a sabbath: 24:21for then shall be great tribulation, 
such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever 
shall be. 24:22And except those days had been 
shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect's sake those days 
shall be shortened. 24:23Then if any man shall say unto you, 
Lo, here is the Christ, or, Here; believe it not. 24:24For there shall 
arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; 
so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. 24:25Behold, I have 
told you beforehand. 24:26If therefore they shall say unto you, 
Behold, he is in the wilderness; go not forth: Behold, he is in the inner 
chambers; believe it not. 24:27For as the lightning cometh forth from 
the east, and is seen even unto the west; so shall be the coming of the Son of 
man. 24:28Wheresoever the carcase is, there will 
the eagles be gathered together. 
24:29But immediately after the tribulation 
of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, 
and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be 
shaken: 24:30and then shall appear the sign of the 
Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they 
shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great 
glory. 24:31And he shall send forth his angels 
with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from 
the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. 
24:32Now from the fig tree learn her 
parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye 
know that the summer is nigh; 24:33even so ye also, when ye see all these 
things, know ye that he is nigh, even at the doors. 24:34Verily I say unto 
you, This generation shall not pass away, till all these things be accomplished. 
24:35Heaven and earth shall pass away, but 
my words shall not pass away. 24:36But of that day and hour knoweth no 
one, not even the angels of heaven, neither the Son, but the Father only. 24:37And as were the days of Noah, 
so shall be the coming of the Son of man. 24:38For as in those 
days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and 
giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, 24:39and they knew not until the flood 
came, and took them all away; so shall be the coming of the Son of man. 24:40Then shall two man be in the field; 
one is taken, and one is left: 24:41two women shall be grinding at 
the mill; one is taken, and one is left. 24:42Watch therefore: 
for ye know not on what day your Lord cometh. 24:43But know this, 
that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he 
would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through. 
24:44Therefore be ye also ready; for in an 
hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh. 
24:45Who then is the faithful and wise 
servant, whom his lord hath set over his household, to give them their food in 
due season? 24:46Blessed is that servant, whom his lord 
when he cometh shall find so doing. 24:47Verily I say unto you, that he will 
set him over all that he hath. 24:48But if that evil servant shall say in 
his heart, My lord tarrieth; 24:49and shall begin to beat his 
fellow-servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken; 24:50the lord of that 
servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he 
knoweth not, 24:51and shall cut him asunder, and appoint 
his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of 
teeth. 

25:1Then shall the kingdom of heaven be 
likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the 
bridegroom. 25:2And five of them were foolish, and five 
were wise. 25:3For the foolish, when they took their 
lamps, took no oil with them: 25:4but the wise took oil in their vessels 
with their lamps. 25:5Now while the bridegroom tarried, they 
all slumbered and slept. 25:6But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, 
the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him. 25:7Then all those 
virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 25:8And the foolish said unto the wise, 
Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out. 25:9But the wise 
answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye 
rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. 25:10And while they 
went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him 
to the marriage feast: and the door was shut. 25:11Afterward came 
also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 25:12But he answered 
and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 25:13Watch therefore, 
for ye know not the day nor the hour. 
25:14For it is as when a man, 
going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his 
goods. 25:15And unto one he gave five talents, to 
another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he 
went on his journey. 25:16Straightway he that received the five 
talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents. 25:17In like manner he also that 
received the two gained other two. 25:18But he that 
received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. 25:19Now after a long time the lord of 
those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them. 25:20And he that 
received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, 
thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents. 25:21His lord said unto him, Well done, 
good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set 
thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 25:22And he also that 
received the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me 
two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents. 25:23His lord said unto 
him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few 
things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
25:24And he also that had received the one 
talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where 
thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter; 25:25and I was afraid, and went away and 
hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own. 25:26But his lord 
answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that 
I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter; 25:27thou oughtest therefore to have put my 
money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with 
interest. 25:28Take ye away therefore the talent from 
him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents. 25:29For unto every one 
that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath 
not, even that which he hath shall be taken away. 25:30And cast ye out 
the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and 
the gnashing of teeth. 
25:31But when the Son of man shall come in 
his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his 
glory: 25:32and before him shall be gathered all 
the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd 
separateth the sheep from the goats; 25:33and he shall set the sheep on his 
right hand, but the goats on the left. 25:34Then shall the King say unto them on 
his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for 
you from the foundation of the world: 25:35for I was hungry, and ye gave me to 
eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; 
25:36naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, 
and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 25:37Then shall the 
righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or 
athirst, and gave thee drink? 25:38And when saw we thee a stranger, and 
took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? 25:39And when saw we 
thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? 25:40And the King shall 
answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one 
of these my brethren, even these least, ye did it unto me. 25:41Then shall he say also unto them on 
the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is 
prepared for the devil and his angels: 25:42for I was hungry, and ye did not give 
me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink; 25:43I was a stranger, 
and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye 
visited me not. 25:44Then shall they also answer, saying, 
Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or 
in prison, and did not minister unto thee? 25:45Then shall he 
answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one 
of these least, ye did it not unto me. 25:46And these shall go away into eternal 
punishment: but the righteous into eternal life. 

26:1And it came to pass, when Jesus had 
finished all these words, he said unto his disciples, 26:2Ye know that after 
two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be 
crucified. 26:3Then were gathered together the chief 
priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who 
was called Caiaphas; 26:4and they took counsel together that 
they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him. 26:5But they said, Not 
during the feast, lest a tumult arise among people. 
26:6Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the 
house of Simon the leper, 26:7there came unto him a woman having an 
alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, 
as he sat at meat. 26:8But when the disciples saw it, they had 
indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? 26:9For this 
ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. 26:10But Jesus perceiving it said unto 
them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. 26:11For ye have the poor always with you; 
but me ye have not always. 26:12For in that she poured this ointment 
upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. 26:13Verily I say unto 
you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also 
which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. 
26:14Then one of the twelve, who was called 
Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, 26:15and said, What are 
ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto 
him thirty pieces of silver. 26:16And from that time he sought 
opportunity to deliver him unto them.
26:17Now on the first day of 
unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we 
make ready for thee to eat the passover? 26:18And he said, Go 
into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at 
hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. 26:19And the disciples 
did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover. 
26:20Now when even was come, he was sitting 
at meat with the twelve disciples; 26:21and as they were eating, he said, 
Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 26:22And they were 
exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord? 26:23And he answered and said, He that 
dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. 26:24The Son of man goeth, even as it is 
written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! 
good were it for that man if he had not been born. 26:25And Judas, who 
betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast 
said. 
26:26And as they were eating, Jesus took 
bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, 
eat; this is my body. 26:27And he took a cup, and gave thanks, 
and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; 26:28for this is my 
blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of sins. 26:29But I say unto you, I shall not drink 
henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with 
you in my Father's kingdom. 
26:30And when they had sung a hymn, they 
went out unto the mount of Olives. 
26:31Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye 
shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the 
shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. 26:32But after I am raised up, I will go 
before you into Galilee. 26:33But Peter answered and said unto him, 
If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended. 26:34Jesus said unto 
him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt 
deny me thrice. 26:35Peter saith unto him, Even if I must 
die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the 
disciples. 
26:36Then cometh Jesus with them unto a 
place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go 
yonder and pray. 26:37And he took with him Peter and the two 
sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled. 26:38Then saith he unto them, My soul is 
exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me. 26:39And he went forward a little, and fell 
on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass 
away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt. 26:40And he cometh unto the disciples, and 
findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me 
one hour? 26:41Watch and pray, that ye enter not into 
temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 26:42Again a second time he went away, and 
prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will 
be done. 26:43And he came again and found them 
sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 26:44And he left them again, and went away, 
and prayed a third time, saying again the same words. 26:45Then cometh he to 
the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, 
the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
26:46Arise, let us be going: behold, he is 
at hand that betrayeth me. 
26:47And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one 
of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from 
the chief priest and elders of the people. 26:48Now he that 
betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take 
him. 26:49And straightway he came to Jesus, and 
said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him. 26:50And Jesus said unto him, Friend, 
do that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, 
and took him. 26:51And behold, one of them that were with 
Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the 
high priest, and struck off his ear. 26:52Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up 
again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish 
with the sword. 26:53Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech 
my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? 26:54How then should the scriptures be 
fulfilled that thus it must be? 26:55In that hour said Jesus to the 
multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize 
me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not. 26:56But all this is 
come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all 
the disciples left him, and fled. 
26:57And they that had taken Jesus led him 
away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the 
elders were gathered together. 26:58But Peter followed him afar off, unto 
the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see 
the end. 26:59Now the chief priests and the whole 
council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death; 26:60and they found it not, though many 
false witnesses came. But afterward came two, 26:61and said, This man 
said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. 26:62And the high priest stood up, and said 
unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 
26:63But Jesus held his peace. And the high 
priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether 
thou art the Christ, the Son of God. 26:64Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said: 
nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at 
the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven. 26:65Then the high priest rent his 
garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of 
witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy: 26:66what think ye? 
They answered and said, He is worthy of death. 26:67Then did they spit 
in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands, 26:68saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: 
who is he that struck thee? 
26:69Now Peter was sitting without in the 
court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the 
Galilaean. 26:70But he denied before them all, saying, 
I know not what thou sayest. 26:71And when he was gone out into the 
porch, another maid saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This 
man also was with Jesus of Nazareth. 26:72And again he denied with an oath, I 
know not the man. 26:73And after a little while they that 
stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art one of them; 
for thy speech maketh thee known. 26:74Then began he to curse and to swear, I 
know not the man. And straightway the cock crew. 26:75And Peter 
remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny 
me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. 

27:1Now when morning was come, all the 
chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him 
to death: 27:2and they bound him, and led him away, 
and delivered him up to Pilate the governor. 
27:3Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he 
saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces 
of silver to the chief priests and elders, 27:4saying, I have 
sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see 
thou to it. 27:5And he cast down the pieces of silver 
into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself. 27:6And the chief priests took the pieces 
of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is 
the price of blood. 27:7And they took counsel, and bought with 
them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. 27:8Wherefore that 
field was called, the field of blood, unto this day. 27:9Then was fulfilled 
that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the 
thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom certain 
of the children of Israel did price; 27:10and they gave them for the potter's 
field, as the Lord appointed me. 
27:11Now Jesus stood before the governor: 
and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus 
said unto him, Thou sayest. 27:12And when he was accused by the chief 
priests and elders, he answered nothing. 27:13Then saith Pilate 
unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? 27:14And he gave him no answer, not even to 
one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. 27:15Now at the feast 
the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they 
would. 27:16And they had then a notable prisoner, 
called Barabbas. 27:17When therefore they were gathered 
together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, 
or Jesus who is called Christ? 27:18For he knew that for envy they had 
delivered him up. 27:19And while he was sitting on the 
judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that 
righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of 
him. 27:20Now the chief priests and the elders 
persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. 
27:21But the governor answered and said 
unto them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, 
Barabbas. 27:22Pilate saith unto them, What then 
shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified. 
27:23And he said, Why, what evil hath he 
done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified. 27:24So when Pilate saw that he prevailed 
nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his 
hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous 
man; see ye to it. 27:25And all the people answered and said, 
His blood be on us, and on our children. 27:26Then released he 
unto them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified. 
27:27Then the soldiers of the governor took 
Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered unto him the whole band. 27:28And they stripped him, and put on him 
a scarlet robe. 27:29And they platted a crown of thorns and 
put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before 
him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 27:30And they spat upon 
him, and took the reed and smote him on the head. 27:31And when they had 
mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and 
led him away to crucify him. 
27:32And as they came out, they found a man 
of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go with them, that he 
might bear his cross. 
27:33And they were come unto a place called 
Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull, 27:34they gave him wine 
to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink. 27:35And when they had crucified him, they 
parted his garments among them, casting lots; 27:36and they sat and 
watched him there. 27:37And they set up over his head his 
accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 27:38Then are there 
crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left. 27:39And they that passed by railed on him, 
wagging their heads, 27:40and saying, Thou that destroyest the 
temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, 
come down from the cross. 27:41In like manner also the chief priests 
mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, 27:42He saved others; 
himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the 
cross, and we will believe on him. 27:43He trusteth on God; let him deliver 
him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God. 27:44And the robbers also that were 
crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach. 
27:45Now from the sixth hour there was 
darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. 27:46And about the 
ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? 
that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 27:47And some of them 
stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah. 27:48And straightway one of them ran, and 
took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to 
drink. 27:49And the rest said, Let be; let us see 
whether Elijah cometh to save him. 27:50And Jesus cried again with a loud 
voice, and yielded up his spirit. 27:51And behold, the veil of the temple was 
rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks 
were rent; 27:52and the tombs were opened; and many 
bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised; 27:53and coming forth 
out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and 
appeared unto many. 27:54Now the centurion, and they that were 
with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were 
done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. 27:55And many women were there beholding 
from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: 27:56among whom was Mary Magdalene, and 
Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 
27:57And when even was come, there came a 
rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: 27:58this man went to Pilate, and asked for 
the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up. 27:59And Joseph took 
the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 27:60and laid it in his 
own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to 
the door of the tomb, and departed. 27:61And Mary Magdalene was there, and the 
other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. 
27:62Now on the morrow, which is the 
day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered 
together unto Pilate, 27:63saying, Sir, we remember that that 
deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again. 27:64Command therefore that the sepulchre 
be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him 
away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error 
will be worse than the first. 27:65Pilate said unto them, Ye have a 
guard: go, make it as sure as ye can. 27:66So they went, and 
made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them. 

28:1Now late on the sabbath day, as it 
began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and 
the other Mary to see the sepulchre. 28:2And behold, there was a great 
earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled 
away the stone, and sat upon it. 28:3His appearance was as lightning, and 
his raiment white as snow: 28:4and for fear of him the watchers did 
quake, and became as dead men. 28:5And the angel answered and said unto 
the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been crucified. 
28:6He is not here; for he is risen, even 
as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 28:7And go quickly, and 
tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into 
Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. 28:8And they departed 
quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples 
word. 28:9And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All 
hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him. 28:10Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: 
go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me. 
28:11Now while they were going, behold, 
some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the 
things that were come to pass. 28:12And when they were assembled with the 
elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers, 28:13saying, Say ye, His disciples came by 
night, and stole him away while we slept. 28:14And if this come 
to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care. 28:15So they took the money, and did as 
they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and 
continueth until this day. 
28:16But the eleven disciples went into 
Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 28:17And when they saw 
him, they worshipped him; but some doubted. 28:18And Jesus came to 
them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in 
heaven and on earth. 28:19Go ye therefore, and make disciples of 
all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and 
of the Holy Spirit: 28:20teaching them to observe all things 
whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of 
the world.
