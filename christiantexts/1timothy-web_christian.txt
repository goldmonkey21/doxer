1 Timothy. Pauls First Letter to Timothy 

1:1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus 
according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope; 1:2to 
Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father 
and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
1:3As I exhorted you to stay at Ephesus 
when I was going into Macedonia, that you might charge certain men not to teach 
a different doctrine, 1:4neither to pay attention to myths and 
endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God's stewardship, which 
is in faith--1:5but the end of the charge is love, out 
of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith; 1:6from which things 
some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking; 1:7desiring to be teachers of the law, 
though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly 
affirm. 1:8But we know that the law is good, if a 
man uses it lawfully, 1:9as knowing this, that law is not made 
for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and 
sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of 
mothers, for manslayers, 1:10for the sexually immoral, for 
homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other 
thing contrary to the sound doctrine; 1:11according to the Gospel of the glory of 
the blessed God, which was committed to my trust. 1:12And I thank him who 
enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me 
to service; 1:13although I was before a blasphemer, a 
persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly 
in unbelief. 1:14The grace of our Lord abounded 
exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 1:15The saying is 
faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to 
save sinners; of whom I am chief. 1:16However, for this cause I obtained 
mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an 
example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life. 1:17Now to the King eternal, immortal, 
invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. 
1:18This charge I commit to you, my child 
Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you 
may wage the good warfare; 1:19holding faith and a good conscience; 
which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith; 1:20of 
whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be 
taught not to blaspheme. 
2:1I exhort therefore, first of all, that 
petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men: 
2:2for kings and all who are in high 
places; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and 
reverence. 2:3For this is good and acceptable in the 
sight of God our Savior; 2:4who desires all people to be saved and 
come to full knowledge of the truth. 2:5For there is one God, and one mediator 
between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 2:6who gave himself as 
a ransom for all; the testimony in its own times; 2:7to which I was 
appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, not 
lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. 
2:8I desire therefore that the men in every 
place pray, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting. 2:9In the same way, 
that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety; 
not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing; 2:10but (which becomes women professing 
godliness) with good works. 2:11Let a woman learn in quietness with all 
subjection. 2:12But I don't permit a woman to teach, 
nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness. 2:13For Adam was first formed, then Eve. 2:14Adam wasn't deceived, but the woman, 
being deceived, has fallen into disobedience; 2:15but she will be 
saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith, love, and 
sanctification with sobriety. 
3:1This is a faithful saying: if a man 
seeks the office of an overseer, he desires a 
good work. 3:2The overseer therefore must be without 
reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good 
at teaching; 3:3not a drinker, not violent, not greedy 
for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous; 3:4one who rules his 
own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence; 3:5(but 
if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the 
assembly of God?) 3:6not a new convert, lest being puffed up 
he fall into the same condemnation as the devil. 3:7Moreover he must 
have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach 
and the snare of the devil. 
3:8Deacons, in the same way, 
must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for 
money; 3:9holding the mystery of the faith in a 
pure conscience. 3:10Let them also first be tested; then let 
them serve as deacons, if they are blameless. 3:11Their wives in the 
same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things. 3:12Let deacons be husbands of one wife, 
ruling their children and their own houses well. 3:13For those who have 
served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing, and great boldness in 
the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
3:14These things I write to you, hoping to 
come to you shortly; 3:15but if I wait long, that you may know 
how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the assembly of 
the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. 3:16Without 
controversy, the mystery of godliness is great: 
 God was revealed in the 
flesh,      Justified in the 
spirit,      Seen by 
angels,      Preached among the 
nations,      Believed on in the 
world,      And received up in glory. 
4:1But the Spirit says expressly that in 
later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing 
spirits and doctrines of demons, 4:2through the hypocrisy of men who speak 
lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron; 4:3forbidding marriage 
and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with 
thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 4:4For every creature 
of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with 
thanksgiving. 4:5For it is sanctified through the word of 
God and prayer. 4:6If you instruct the brothers of these 
things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of 
the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed. 4:7But refuse profane 
and old wives' fables. Exercise yourself toward godliness. 4:8For bodily exercise 
has some value, but godliness has value for all things, having the promise of 
the life which is now, and of that which is to come. 4:9This saying is 
faithful and worthy of all acceptance. 4:10For to this end we both labor and 
suffer reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the 
Savior of all men, especially of those who believe. 4:11Command and teach 
these things. 
4:12Let no man despise your youth; but be 
an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in 
spirit, in faith, and in purity. 4:13Until I come, pay attention to reading, 
to exhortation, and to teaching. 4:14Don't neglect the gift that is in you, 
which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the 
elders. 4:15Be diligent in these things. Give 
yourself wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed to all. 4:16Pay attention to yourself, and to your 
teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both 
yourself and those who hear you. 
5:1Don't rebuke an older man, but exhort 
him as a father; the younger men as brothers; 5:2the elder women as 
mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity. 5:3Honor widows who are 
widows indeed. 5:4But if any widow has children or 
grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and 
to repay their parents, for this is* 
acceptable in the sight of God. 5:5Now she who is a widow indeed, and 
desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues in petitions and prayers night 
and day. 5:6But she who gives herself to pleasure is 
dead while she lives. 5:7Also command these things, that they may 
be without reproach. 5:8But if anyone doesn't provide for his 
own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse 
than an unbeliever. 5:9Let no one be enrolled as a widow under 
sixty years old, having been the wife of one man, 5:10being approved by 
good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to 
strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the 
afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every good work. 
5:11But refuse younger widows, for when 
they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to marry; 5:12having 
condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge. 5:13Besides, they also 
learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also 
gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not. 5:14I desire therefore 
that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no 
occasion to the adversary for reviling. 5:15For already some have turned aside 
after Satan. 5:16If any man or woman who believes has 
widows, let them relieve them, and don't let the assembly be burdened; that it 
might relieve those who are widows indeed. 
5:17Let the elders who rule well be counted 
worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching. 
5:18For the Scripture says, "You shall not 
muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain." And, "The laborer is worthy of his 
wages." 
5:19Don't receive an accusation against an 
elder, except at the word of two or three witnesses. 5:20Those who sin, 
reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear. 5:21I 
charge you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that 
you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality. 5:22Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be 
a participant in other men's sins. Keep yourself pure. 5:23Be no longer a 
drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your 
frequent infirmities. 
5:24Some men's sins are evident, preceding 
them to judgment, and some also follow later. 5:25In the same way 
also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can't 
be hidden. 
6:1Let as many as are bondservants under 
the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and 
the doctrine not be blasphemed. 6:2Those who have believing masters, let 
them not despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve 
them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach 
and exhort these things. 
6:3If anyone teaches a different doctrine, 
and doesn't consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to 
the doctrine which is according to godliness, 6:4he is conceited, 
knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from 
which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions, 6:5constant friction of 
people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness 
is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such. 
6:6But godliness with contentment is great 
gain. 6:7For we brought nothing into the world, 
and we certainly can't carry anything out. 6:8But having food and 
clothing, we will be content with that. 6:9But those who are determined to be rich 
fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as 
drown men in ruin and destruction. 6:10For the love of money is a root of all 
kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have 
pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 
6:11But you, man of God, flee these things, 
and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and 
gentleness. 6:12Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold 
of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good 
confession in the sight of many witnesses. 6:13I charge you before 
God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius 
Pilate testified the good confession, 6:14that you keep the commandment without 
spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; 6:15which in its own times he will show, 
who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; 6:16who alone has immortality, dwelling in 
unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and 
eternal power. Amen. 
6:17Charge those who are rich in this 
present world that they not be haughty, nor have their hope set on the 
uncertainty of riches, but on the living God, who richly provides us with 
everything to enjoy; 6:18that they do good, that they be rich in 
good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate; 6:19laying up in store for themselves a 
good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal 
life. 
6:20Timothy, guard that which is committed 
to you, turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of the knowledge 
which is falsely so called; 6:21which some professing have erred 
concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
