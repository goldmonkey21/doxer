The following translation is based on the Greek text printed in Jack Finegan's Hidden Records of the Life of Jesus.

  As he led them out, he said, "You will all fall away tonight according to the scripture: 'I will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered.'"
Then Peter said, "Even if everyone else denies you, I won't."
Jesus said, "Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times today."

02 fall away [during this] night

05 [Then] Peter [said], "Even if everyone does, [I will] n[ot]."

07 [you will d]eny [me today.]"
