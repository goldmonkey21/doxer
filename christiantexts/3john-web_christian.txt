3 John. JohnÂ’s Third Letter 
1:1The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I 
love in truth. 
1:2Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in 
all things and be healthy, even as your soul prospers. 1:3For I rejoiced 
greatly, when brothers came and testified about your truth, even as you walk in 
truth. 1:4I have no greater joy than this, to hear 
about my children walking in truth. 
1:5Beloved, you do a faithful work in 
whatever you accomplish for those who are brothers and strangers. 1:6They 
have testified about your love before the assembly. You will do well to send 
them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, 1:7because for the sake 
of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles. 1:8We therefore ought 
to receive such, that we may be fellow workers for the truth. 
1:9I wrote to the assembly, but Diotrephes, 
who loves to be first among them, doesn't accept what we say. 1:10Therefore, if I come, I will call 
attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words. 
Not content with this, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and those 
who would, he forbids and throws out of the assembly. 1:11Beloved, don't 
imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is of God. 
He who does evil hasn't seen God. 1:12Demetrius has the testimony of all, and 
of the truth itself; yes, we also testify, and you know that our testimony is 
true. 
1:13I had many things to write to you, but 
I am unwilling to write to you with ink and pen; 1:14but I hope to see 
you soon, and we will speak face to face. Peace be to you. The friends greet 
you. Greet the friends by name.
