Zostrianos











Translated by John N. Sieber
[...] of the [...] the words [...] live forever, these I [...] Zostrianos [...] and
      [...] and Iolaos, when I was in the world for these like me and [those] after me, [the]
      living elect. As God lives, [...] the truth with truth and knowledge and eternal light. 
After I parted from the somatic darkness in me and the psychic chaos in mind and the
      feminine desire [...] in the darkness, I did not use it again. After I found the infinite
      part of my matter, then I reproved the dead creation within me and the divine Cosmocrater
      of the perceptible (world) by preaching powerfully about the All to those with alien
      parts. 
Although I tried their ways for a little while after the necessity of begetting brought
      me to the revealed, I was never pleased with them, but I always separated myself from them
      because I came into being through a holy [...], yet mixed. When I had set straight my
      sinless soul, then I strengthened 2 the intellectual [...] and I
      [...] in the [...] of my God [...] [...] I having done [...] grow strong in a holy spirit
      higher than god. 
It [came] upon me alone as I was setting myself straight, [and] I saw the perfect child
      [...] [...]. With him who [...] many times and many ways [he] appeared to me as a loving
      father, when I was seeking the male father of all (who are) in thought, perception, (in)
      form, race, [region ...], (in) an All which restrains and is restrained, (in) a body yet
      without a body, (in) essence, matter and [those that] belong to all these. It is with them
      and the god of the unborn Kalyptos and the power [in] them all that existence is mixed. 
(About) existence: how do those who exist, being from the aeon of those who exist,
      (come) from an invisible, undivided and self-begotten spirit? Are they three unborn images
      having an origin better than existence, existing prior [to] all [these], yet having become
      the [world ...]? How are those opposite it and all these 3 [...]
      good, he and an excuse. What is that one"s place? What is his origin? How does the
      one from him exist for him and all these? How [does he come into existence] as a simple
      one, differing [from] himself? Does he exist as existence, form, and blessedness? By
      giving strength is he alive with life? How has the existence which does not exist appeared
      from an existing power? 
I pondered these things to understand them; according to the custom of my race I kept
      bringing them up to the god of my fathers. I kept praising them all, for my forefathers
      and fathers who sought found. As for me, I did not cease seeking a resting place worthy of
      my spirit, since I was not yet bound in the perceptible world. Then, as I was deeply
      troubled and gloomy because of the discouragement which encompassed me, I dared to act and
      to deliver myself to the wild beasts of the desert for a violent death. 
There stood before me the angel of the knowledge of eternal light. He said to me,
      "Zostrianos, why have you gone mad as if you were ignorant of the great eternals 4
      who are above? [...] you [...] [...] say also [...] that you are now saved, [...] [...] in
      eternal death, nor [...] [...] those whom you know in order to [...] save others, [namely]
      my father"s chosen elect? [Do you] [suppose] that you are the father of [your race
      ...] or that Iolaos is your father, a [...] angel of god [...] you through holy men? Come
      and pass through each of these. You will return to them another [time] to preach to a
      living [race ...] and to save those who are worthy, and to strengthen the elect, because
      the struggle of the aeon is great but one"s time in this world is short." 
When he had said this [to me], I very quickly and very gladly went up with him to a
      great light-cloud. I cast my body upon the earth to be guarded by glories. I was rescued
      from the whole world and the thirteen aeons in it and their angelic beings. They did not
      see us, but their archon was disturbed at [our] passage, for the light-cloud 5
      [...] it is better than every [worldly ...] one. Its beauty is ineffable. With strength it
      provides light [guiding] pure spirits as a spirit-savior and an intellectual word, [not]
      like those in the world [...] with changeable matter and an upsetting word. 
Then I knew that the power in me was set over the darkness because it contained the
      whole light. I was baptized there, and I received the image of the glories there. I became
      like one of them. I left the airy-[earth] and passed by the copies of the aeons, after
      washing there seven times [in] living [water], once for each [of the] aeons. I did not
      cease until [I saw] all the waters. I ascended to the Exile which really exists. I was
      baptized and [...] world. I ascended to the Repentance which really exists [and was]
      baptized there four times. I passed by the 6 sixth aeon. I ascended
      to the [...] I stood there after having seen light from the truth which really exists,
      from its self-begotten root, and great angels and glories, [...] number. 
I was baptized in the [name of] the divine Autogenes by those powers which are [upon]
      living waters, Michar and Micheus. I was purified by [the] great Barpharanges. Then they
      [revealed] themselves to me and wrote me in glory. I was sealed by those who are on these
      powers, [Michar] Mi[ch]eus, Seldao, Ele[nos] and Zogenethlos. I became a root-seeing angel
      and stood upon the first aeon which is the fourth. With the souls I blessed the divine
      Autogenes and the forefather Geradamas, [an eye of] the Autogenes, the first perfect
      [man], and Seth Emm[acha Seth], the son of Adamas, the [father of] the [immovable race
      ...] and the [four] [lights ... ] 
      (1 line unrecoverable)
      Mirothea, the mother [...] [...] and Prophania [...] of the lights and De-[...] 7
      [...] 
I was [baptized] for the second time in the name of the divine Autogenes by these same
      powers. I became an angel of the male race. I stood upon the second aeon which is the
      third, with the sons of Seth I blessed each of them. 
I was baptized for the third time in the name of the divine Autogenes by each of these
      powers. I became a holy angel. I stood upon the third aeon which is the second. I blessed
      each of them. 
I was baptized for the fourth time by [each of] these powers. I became [a] perfect
      [angel] [I stood upon] the fourth aeon [which is the first], and [I blessed each of them.]
      
Then I sought [...] I said [...] I [...] of [...] I 
      (1 line unrecoverable)
      [...] why [...] [...] with power [...] about them in another way in the reports 8
      of men? Are these their powers? Or, are these the ones, but their names differ from one
      another? Are there souls different from souls? Why are people different from one another?
      What and in what way are they human?" 
The great ruler on high, Authrounios, said to me, "Are you asking about those whom
      you have passed by? And about this airy-earth, why it has a cosmic model? And about the
      aeon copies, how many there are, and, why they are [not] in pain? And, about Exile and
      Repentance and the creation of the [aeons] and the world which [...] really [...] you,
      about [...] me, them [...] nor [...] you [...] invisible [spirit ...] and the [...] of
      [...] 
      (3 lines unrecoverable)
      and [...] [...] when I [...] 
9 The great ruler on high, Authrounios, said to me, "The
      airy-earth came into being by a word, yet it is the begotten and perishable ones whom it
      reveals by its indestructibility. In regard to the coming of the great judges, (they came)
      so as not to taste perception and to be enclosed in creation, and when they came upon it
      and saw through it the works of the world, they condemned its ruler to death because he
      was a model of the world, a [...] and an origin of matter begotten of lost darkness. 
When Sophia looked at [...] them she produced the darkness, as she [... she] is beside
      the [... he is a] model [...] of essence [...] form [...] to an image [...] I [...] the
      All 
      (2 lines unrecoverable)
      [...] darkness [...] [...] say [...] powers [... aeons] of [creation ...] to see any of
      the eternal ones. 10 he saw a reflection. In relation to the
      reflection which he saw in it, he created the world. With a reflection of a reflection he
      worked at producing the world, and then even the reflection belonging to visible reality
      was taken from him. But to Sophia a place of rest was given in exchange for her
      repentance. Thus, there was in her no prior reflection, pure in itself beforehand. 
After they had already come into being through it, he used his imagination (and)
      produced the remainder, for the image of Sophia was always being lost because her
      countenance was deceiving. But the Archon [...] and made a body which [...] concerning the
      greater [...] down [...] when I saw [...] to the heart [...]

      he having [...]

      [...] through him, as he 11 [revealed] the destruction of the world
      by his [immutability]. It is in the following way that the copies of the aeons exist. They
      have not obtained a single power"s shape. It is eternal glories that they possess,
      and they dwell in the judgment seats of each of the powers. 
But when souls are illuminated by the light in them and (by) the model which often
      comes into being in them without suffering, she did not think that she saw [...] and the
      eternal [...] in the blessed [...] each single one [...] each of [...] light [... all],

      have in themselves, [...] lower are produced by the copies. Those who receive a model of
      their souls are still in the world. They came into being after the departure of the aeons,
      one by one, and they are removed one by one from the copy of Exile to the Exile that
      really exists, from the copy of Repentance to the Repentance that really exists, [and from
      the] copy of Autogenes to [the Autogenes] that really exists. The remainder [...] the
      souls [...] exist in a [...] all [...] of aeons [...]

      the unborn Kalyptos, the great male Protophanes, the perfect child who is higher than god,
      and his eye, Pigeradamas. 
I called upon the Child of the Child, Ephesech. He stood before me and said, "O
      angel of god, O son of the father, [...] the perfect man. Why are you calling on me and
      asking about those things which you know, as though you were [ignorant] of them?" And
      I said, "I have asked about the mixture [...] it is perfect and gives [...] there is
      power which [has ... those] in which we receive baptism [...] these names are [different
      ...] and why [...] from one [...] in the [... from] others [...] men [... different] 
      (3 lines unrecoverable) 
14 He said, "[Zost]rianos, listen about these [...] for the
      first [...] origins are three because they have appeared in a single origin [of] the
      Barbelo aeon, not like some origins and powers, nor like (one) from an origin and power.
      It is to every origin that they have appeared; they have strengthened every power; and
      they appeared from that which is far better than themselves. These (three) are Existence,
      Blessedness and Life. [...] [...] their companions [...] in a [...] and concerning the
      [...] having named [...] more than [...] and [...] a perfect [...] from a 
      (6 lines unrecoverable)

15 And a water of each one of them [...] ; therefore [...] waters
      are the perfect ones. It is the water of life that belongs to Vitality in which you now
      have been baptized in the Autogenes. It is in the [water] of Blessedness which belongs to
      Knowledge that you will be baptized in the Protophanes. It is the water of Existence
      [which] belongs to Divinity, the Kalyptos. Now the water of Life [exists in relation to
      ...] power; that belonging to Blessedness in relation to essence; that belonging to
      [Divinity] in relation to [Existence ...]. But all these [...] authority and [...] those
      who [...] water which [becomes pure ...] [...] according to [... when they] depart

[...] 16 Existence as [he] is in it. [He] not only [was dwelling]
      in Thought, but he also [...] them that it is he who is [Being] in the following way. In
      order that this world might not be endless and formless, he placed a [...] over it; but in
      order that [he] might become something, the truly young crossed it with what is his,
      [thus] Existence. It is with the [son] that he is located, with him that he seeks, him
      that he surrounds [...] everywhere [...] from the truth [...] takes him who [...] exists
      [...] activity [...] life [...] his word also [...] are these after [...] they became
      [...] 
      (5 lines unrecoverable)

[...] 17 and the power is with the Essence and Existence of
      Being, when the water exists. But the name in which they wash is a word of the water. Then
      the first perfect water of the triple-power of the Autogenes [is] the perfect soul"s
      life, for it is a word of the perfect god while coming into being [...] for the Invisible
      Spirit is a fountain of them all. Thus, the rest are from [knowledge ...] as his likeness.
      [But] he who knows himself [...] what kind and what [...] alive at one time [...] live
      with a [...] he is the [...] life, in the [...] become [limitless ... ] his [... his] [own
      ... ] the name 
      (4 lines unrecoverable)
18 he really exists. It is he because he limits himself. They
      approach the water according to this single power and the likeness of order. 
The great male invisible Mind, the perfect Protophanes has his own water as you [will
      see] when you arrive at his place. This is also the case with the unborn Kalyptos. In
      accordance with each one exists a partial entity with a first form, so that they might
      become perfect in this way; for the self-begotten aeons are four perfect entities. [The]
      individuals of the all-perfect ones [...] them as perfect individuals. And the [...] aeon
      [...] of the Autogenes [...] for all [...] [perfect] male [...] for the alls [...]
      [perfect god ... the triple-] male [...] [perfect] individual [...] in the [...] 
      (5 lines unrecoverable)
19 perfect, those who exist according to a form, a race, an All and
      a partial difference. This is also the case with the highway of ascent which is higher
      than perfect and Kalyptos. 
The Autogenes is the chief archon of his own aeons and angels as his parts, for those
      who are the four individuals belong to him; they belong to the fifth aeon together. The
      fifth exists in one; the four [are] the fifth, part by part. But these [four] are complete
      individually [because they] have a [...] it is also [...] with [the triple male]
      individual [...] for he is a [...] of [...] god, the invisible [Protophanes] [... male]
      mind [...] which exists 
      (6 lines unrecoverable)
20 living and perfect parts. 
(About) the All and the all-perfect race and the one who is higher than perfect and
      blessed. The self-begotten Kalyptos pre-exists because he is an origin of the Autogenes, a
      god and a forefather, a cause of the Protophanes, a father of the parts that are his. As a
      divine father he is foreknown: but he is unknown, for he is a power and a father from
      himself. Therefore, he is [fatherless]. The Invisible Triple Powerful, First Thought [of]
      all [these], the Invisible Spirit [...] is a [...] and Essence which [...] and Existence
      [...] there are [existences] the [...] blessed [...] the [...] all these [...] the [...] 
      (3 lines unrecoverable)
21 exist in them, [and] they [...] in others [...] by them all in
      many places. They are in every place that he loves and desires, yet they are not in any
      place. They have capacity for spirit, for they are incorporeal yet are better than
      incorporeal. They are undivided with living thoughts and a power of truth with those purer
      than these since with respect to him they are purer and are not like the bodies which are
      in one place. Above all, they have necessity either in relation to the All or to a part.
      Therefore, the way of ascent [...] it is pure [...] each [...] herself and 
      (1 line unrecoverable)
      [...] them 
      (3 lines unrecoverable)
      [... above all] 
      (1 line unrecoverable)
22 particular aeons. 
Then [he said], "How then can he contain an eternal model? The general intellect
      shares when the self-begotten water becomes perfect. It one knows him and all these, one
      is the protophanic water. If one joins oneself with all these, one is that water which
      belongs to Kalyptos, whose image is still in the aeons. To understand individually all
      their parts, they are [...] , those of the All where knowledge is. They have [separated]
      from the one whom they knew and (from) fellowship with one another. The All and all these,
      when they [...] wash in the [washing of] [Autogenes] he [...] of [...] 
      (5 lines unrecoverable)
23 he appears to [him], that is, when one knows how he exists for
      him and (how) he has fellowship with their companions, one has washed in the washing of
      Protophanes. And if in understanding the origin of these, how they all appear from a
      single origin, how all who are joined come to be divided, how those who are divided join
      again, and how the parts [join with] the alls and the species and [kinds - if] one
      understands these things, one has washed in the washing of Kalyptos. 
According to each of [the] places one has a portion of the eternal ones [and] ascends
      [...] as he [...] pure and simple, he is always [...] one of the [...] [always] he is pure
      for simpleness. He is filled [...] [in ...] Existence and a holy spirit. There is 24
      nothing of his outside of him. He can [see] with his perfect soul those who belong to
      Autogenes; with his mind , those who belong to the Triple Male, and with his holy spirit,
      those who belong to Protophanes. He can learn of Kalyptos through the powers of the spirit
      from whom they have come forth in a far better revelation of the Invisible Spirit. And by
      means of thought which now is in silence and by First Thought (he learns) of the Triple
      Powerful Invisible Spirit, since there is then a report and power of silence which is
      purified in a life-giving spirit. (It is) perfect and [...] perfect and all-perfect. 
Glories, therefore, which are set over these, are [life-givers] who have been baptized
      in truth and knowledge. Those who are worthy are guarded, but those who [are] not from
      this race [...] and go [...] these who [...] [...] in the fifth, he being [...] [...] copy
      [...] of the aeons [...] namely a washing but if [he] strips off the world 25
      and lays aside [knowledge], and (if) he is he who has no dwelling place and power, then
      because he follows the ways of the others, he is also a sojourner, but (if) he is one who
      has committed no sin because knowledge was sufficient for him, he is not anxious when he
      repents, and then washings are appointed" in these in addition. 
(Concerning) (the path ...) to the self-begotten ones, those in which you have now been
      baptised each time, (a path) worthy of seeing the [perfect ...] individuals: it serves as
      knowledge of the All since it came into being from the powers of the self-begotten ones,
      the one you acquire when you pass through the all-perfect aeons. When you receive the
      third washing [...], you will learn about the [...] really [...] in [that] place. 
About these names, they are as follows: because he is one, they [...] is like [...]
      while he [came into being ...] exists and [...] a word they [said ...] 26
      This is a name which really exists together with [these] within her. These who exist do so
      in [...] ... resembles. His resemblance in kind (is) within what is his own. He can see
      it, understand it enter it, (and) take a resemblance from it. Now (they can) speak aloud
      and hear sounds, but they are unable to obey because they are perceptible and somatic.
      Therefore, just as they are able to contain them by containing them thus, so is he an
      image which is [...] in this way, having come into existence in perception [by] a word
      which is better than material nature but lower than intellectual essence. 
Do not be amazed about the differences among souls. When they think they are different
      and do [not resemble] [...] of those who [...] and that [...] aloud [...] he being lost
      [...] their [souls] [...] body, and that [... his] time, he [...] a desire, 27
      their souls exist as [...] their body. As for those who are totally pure, there are four
      [...] that they possess; but those [in] time are nine. Each one of them has its species
      and its custom. Their likenesses differ in being separated, and they stand. 
Other immortal souls associate with all these souls because of the Sophia who looked
      down; for there are three species of immortal soul: first, those who have taken root upon
      the Exile because they have no ability to beget, (something) that only those who follow
      the ways of the others have, the one being a single species which [...]; being second,
      those who stand [upon the] Repentance which [...] sin, (it) being sufficient [...
      knowledge ...] being new [...] and he has [...] difference [...] they have sinned with the
      others [and] 28 they have repented with the others [...] from them
      alone, for [...] are species which exist in [...] with those who committed all sins and
      repented. Either they are parts, or they desired of their own accord. Therefore, their
      other aeons are six according to the place which has come to each (fem.) of them. The
      third (species) is that of the souls of the self-begotten ones because they have a word of
      the ineffable truth, one which exists in knowledge and [power] from themselves alone and
      eternal [life]. They have four differences like the species of angels who exist: those who
      love the truth; those who hope; those who believe having [...]; those who are [...] They
      exist, he being [...] the self-begotten ones [...] he is the one belonging to [perfect ...
      life]; the second is [...] the [...] knowledge [...] the fourth is that one [belonging to
      the] immortal [souls ...] 
29 The four Lights dwell [there] in the following way. [Armozel]
      is placed upon the first aeon. (He is) a promise of god, [...] of truth and a joining of
      soul. Oroiael, a power (and) seer of truth, is set over the second. Daveithe, a vision of
      knowledge, is set over the third. Eleleth, an eager desire and preparation for truth, is
      set over the fourth. The four exist because they are expressions of truth and knowledge.
      They exist, although they do not belong to Protophanes but to the mother, for she is a
      thought of the perfect mind of the light, so that immortal souls might receive knowledge
      for themselves. [...] at these, the Autogenes [...]rse[...]oas, a life [...] all he is a
      word [...] ineffable [...] truth he who says [... revelation] concerning the [...] that it
      exists as [...] exists above in [...] 30 [... joined] in a yoking of
      it in light and thought within his [...]. 
Since Adamas, the perfect man, is an eye of Autogenes, it is his knowledge which
      comprehends that the divine Autogenes is a word of the perfect mind of truth. The son of
      Adam, Seth, comes to each of the souls. As knowledge he is sufficient for them. Therefore,
      [the] living [seed] came into existence from him. Mirothea is [...] the divine Autogenes,
      a [...] from her and [...], she being a thought of the perfect mind because of that
      existence of hers. What is it? Or did she exist? [...] does she exist? Therefore, the
      divine Autogenes is word and knowledge, and the knowledge [... word.] Therefore [...]
      Adarn a [s ...] of the [simple ones] when she appeared [...] a change of [the] souls [...]
      she herself is [...] [...] perfect.

And all of them did not need salvation [...] first, but they are safe and exist very
      humbly. Now (about) the man [of] those who are dead: his soul, [his mind and his body all
      [are dead]. Sufferings [...] fathers of [...] material [...] the fire [...] 
      (4 lines unrecoverable)
43 it crosses over. And the second man is the immortal soul in those
      who are dead. If it is anxious over itself, then [when it seeks] those things which are
      profitable [according to ...] each one of them, [then it] experiences bodily suffering.
      They [...] and it [... because] it has an eternal god, it associates with daimons. 
Now concerning the man in the Exile; when he discovers the truth in himself, he is far
      from the deeds of the others who exist [wrongly] (and) stumble. (Concerning) the man who
      repents: when he renounces the dead and desires those things which are because of immortal
      mind and his immortal soul, first he [...] makes an inquiry about it, not about conduct
      but about their deeds, for from him he [...] [...] and [...] obtain [...] 44
      and the man who can be saved is the one who seeks him and his mind and who finds each one
      of them. Oh how much power he has! And the man who is saved is the one who has not known
      how these [...] exist, but he himself by means of [the] word as it exists [...] received
      each one [...] in every place, having become simple and one, for then he is saved because
      he can pass through all [these]. He becomes the [...] all these. If he [desires] again,
      then he parts from them all, and he withdraws to himself [alone]; for he can become divine
      by having taken refuge in god." 
When I heard this, I brought a blessing to the living and unborn God in truth and (to)
      the unborn Kalyptos and the Protophanes, the invisible, male, perfect Mind, and the
      invisible triple-male Child [and to the] divine Autogenes. 45 I said
      to the child of the child Ephesek who was with me, "Can your wisdom instruct me about
      the scattering of the man who is saved, and (about) those who are mixed with him, and who
      those are who share with him, in order that the living elect might know?" 
Then the child of the child Ephesek told [me ...] openly, "If he withdraws to
      himself alone many times, and if he comes into being with reference to the knowledge of
      the others, Mind and the immortal [Origin] will not understand. Then it has a shortage,
      [...] for he turns, has nothing and separates from it and stands [...] and comes into
      being by an alien [impulse ...I, instead of becoming one. Therefore, he bears many forms.
      When he turns aside, he comes into being seeking those things that do not exist. When he
      falls down to them in thought and knows them in another way because he is powerless,
      unless perhaps 46 he is enlightened, he becomes a product of nature.
      Thus he comes down to birth because of it and is speechless because of the pains and
      infiniteness of matter. Although he possesses an eternal and immortal power, he is bound
      within the [movement] of the body. He is [made] alive and is bound [always] within cruel,
      cutting bonds by every evil breath, until he [acts] again and begins again to come to his
      senses. 
Therefore, powers are appointed for their salvation, and each one of them is in the
      world. Within the self-begotten ones corresponding to each of the [aeons] stand glories so
      that one who is in the [world] might be safe beside them. The glories are perfect thoughts
      appearing in powers. They do not perish because they [are] models for salvation [by] which
      each one is saved. He receives a model (and) strength from each of them, and with the
      glory as a helper he will thus pass out from the world [and the aeons ...]. 
These 47 are the guardians of the immortal soul: Gamaliel and
      Strempsouchos, Akramas and Loel, and Mnesinous. [This is the] immortal spirit, Yesseus-
      Mazareu[s]-Ye[s]sedekeus. He is [...] of the child [...] or, the child of the child, and
      [...] But Ormos is [...] on the living seed and Kam[...]el is the spirit-giving. There
      stand before [them] Seisauel and Audael and Abrasax, the myriads-Phaleris, Phalses, [and]
      Eurios, the guardians of [the] glory-Stetheus, Theo[pe]mptos, Eurumeneus and Olsen. Their
      assistants in everything are Ba[...]mos, [.]son, Eir[.]n, Lalameus, Eidomeneus and
      Authrounios. The judges are Sumphthar, Eukrebos and Keilar. The inheritor is Samblo. The
      angels who guide the clouds are the clouds Sappho and Thouro." 
When he had said these things, he told me about all of those in the self-begotten
      aeons. They were all 48 eternal Lights, perfect because they were
      perfected individually. I saw corresponding to each one of the aeons a living earth, a
      living water, [air made] of light and a fire [that] cannot burn, because all of [them ...]
      are simple and immutable, simple and eternal [living beings], having [...] of many kinds,
      trees of many kinds that do not perish, [also] tares of this sort and all of these:
      imperishable fruit, living men and every species, immortal souls, every form and species
      of mind, true gods, angels existing in great glory, an indissoluable body, an unborn birth
      and an immovable perception. Also there was the one who suffers, although he is unable to
      suffer, for he was a power of a power.

      one another, but to the contrary they are alive, existing in themselves and agreeing with
      one another, as they are from a single origin. They are reconciled because they are all in
      a single aeon of Kalyptos, [...] being divided in power, for they exist in accord with
      each of the aeons, standing in relationship to the one which has reached them. 
But Kalyptos is [a] single aeon; [he] has four different aeons. In accord with each of
      the aeons they have powers, not like first and second (powers), for all these [are]
      eternities, [but] they are different [...] and order and glory [...] which exists [in ...]

      (1 line unrecoverable)
116 All of them exist in one, dwelling together and perfected
      individually in fellowship and filled with the aeon which really exists. There are those
      among them (who stand) as dwelling in essence and those (who stand) as essence in conduct
      or [suffering] because they are in a second, for the unengenderedness of the ungenerated
      one who really exists is among them. When the ungenerated have come into being, their
      power stands; there is an incorporeal essence with [an] imperishable [body]. The
      [immutable one] is [there] who [really ] exists. Because it transforms [through] change,
      the [...] in destructible fire stands with [all] [these ...] [...] one [...] 117
      he stands. It is there that all living beings dwell, existing individually (yet) all
      joined together. The knowledge of the knowledge is there together with a setting up of
      ignorance. Chaos is there and a perfect place for all of them, and they are strange. True
      Light (is there), also enlightened darkness together with the one who does not really
      exist - [he] does not really exist. [...] the non-being who does not exist at all. But it
      is he, the Good, from whom derives the good and what is pleasant and the divine; (it is

118 and a race. He has not mixed with anything, but he remains alone
      in himself and rests himself on his limitless limit. He is [the] God of those who really
      exist, a seer and a revealer of God.

120 know him and the one who is set over a second. The first of the
      aeons is Harmedon, the father-glory. The second Light (is) one whom [he does] not [know],
      but all the [individuals], wisdom [...] exist in the fourth aeon who has revealed
      [himself] and all the glories. [The third] Light (is) he [...] not him, as the word of all
      [the forms] and that other [glory], understanding, [who is] in the third [aeon]. There are

121 fifth. 
The first (is the one) who is the second, that is, it is the all-perfect Kalyptos, for
      the four Lights exist. It is Kalyptos who has divided again, and they exist together. All
      who know those who exist as glories are perfect. This one [...] knows everything about
      them all is all-perfect. From him is every power, every one and their entire aeon, because
      they all come to him and they all come from him, the power of them all (and) the origin of
      them all. When he learned [of them], he became a [...] aeon and a ingenerateness. [...]

These are all the glories: the limitless Aphredons, [...] the ineffables, the
      revealers, all the [...] immutables, the glory-revealers, the twice-revealed Marsedons,
      the limitless Solmises, the self-revealers who are [full] of glory, those who [wait for]

      (3 lines unrecoverable)
      (Lines 24ff, I or 2, do not survive) 123 ten thousand glories in
      them. 
Therefore, he is a perfect glory so that whenever he can join (another) and prevail, he
      exists as perfect. Thus, even if he enters into a body and a death (coming) from matter,
      they do not receive greater honor because of their all-perfectness from whom came all
      these, being perfect, together with those who are with him. Indeed, each of the aeons has
      ten thousand aeons in himself, so that by existing together he may become a perfect aeon. 
He exists in the [Blessedness] of the Triple [Powerful] Perfect Invisible [Spirit ...]
      silence [...] who became first [...] and the knowledge 
      (3 lines unrecoverable)
124 whole, a silence of the second knowledge, the first thought in
      the will of the Triple Powerful, because he commanded it to know him, so that he might
      become all-perfect and perfect in himself. By simplicity and blessedness he is known. [I
      received] goodness through that follower of the Barbelo aeon who gives being to himself.
      [...] is not the power, but she is the one who belongs to him. 
The aeons which really exist do so in silence. Existence was inactivity, and knowledge
      of the self-established Kalyptos was ineffable. Having come [from the] fourth, the [...]
      thought, the Proto[phanes], as (the) Perfect Male [Mind] 
      (2 lines unrecoverable)
125 he is his image, equal to him in power and glory but with
      respect to order higher than him, (yet not higher) in aeon. Like him he has all these
      (parts) living (and) dwelling together in one. Together with the aeon in the aeons he has
      a fourfold difference with all the rest who are there. 
But Kalyptos really exists, and with him is located she who belongs to all the glories,
      Youel, the male virgin glory, through whom are seen the all-perfect ones. Those who stand
      before him are the triple [...] child, the triple [...], the Autogenes [...] He has [...]
      in one [... the one] again who prevails over the [...] existing in [...] 126
      of ten thousand- fold. 
The first aeon in him, from whom is the first Light, (is) Solmis and the god revealer,
      since he is infinite according to the type in the Kalyptos aeon and Doxomedon. The second
      aeon (is) Akremon the ineffable together with the second Light Zachthos and Yachtos. The
      third aeon is Ambrosios the virgin together with the third Light Setheus and Antiphantes.
      The fourth aeon is the blesser [...] race with [the] fourth Light [Seldao] and Elenos.

      Activity of all the individuals appeared again as the divine Autogenes. 
He stands within an aeon because there are within him four different self-begotten
      aeons. The first aeon in him as the first Light (is) [Harmoze]l-Orneos-Euthrou- nios. [He]
      was called

      The fourth (aeon) as the fourth Light (is) Eleleth-Kodere- Epiphanios-Allogenios. But as
      for all the rest who are in matter, they were all left (there). It was because of
      knowledge of greatness, audacity and power that they came into existence and comforted
      themselves. Because they did not know God, they shall pass away. Behold, Zostrianos, you
      have heard all these things of the gods are ignorant and (which) seem infinite to
      angels." 
I took courage and said, "I am [still ] wondering about the Triple Powerful
      Invisible Perfect Spirit: how he exists for himself, [how he causes] everything [...] who
      really exist [...] what is the [...] [...] and [...] [...] of [...] 129
      very [...] they set [me] down (and) left. 
Apophantes and Aphropais, the Virgin-light, came before me and brought me into
      Protophanes, (the) great male perfect Mind. I saw all of them as they exist in one. I
      joined with them all (and) blessed the Kalyptos aeon, the virgin Barbelo and the Invisible
      Spirit. I became all-perfect and received power. I was written in glory and sealed. I
      received there a perfect crown. I came forth to the perfect individuals, and all of them
      were questioning me. They were listening to the loftiness of my knowledge. They were
      rejoicing and receiving power. When I again came down to the aeons of Autogenes, I
      received a true image, pure (yet) suitable for the perceptible (world). 
I came down to the aeon copies and came down here 130 to the
      airy-earth. I wrote three tablets (and) left them as knowledge for those who would come
      after me, the living elect. Then I came down to the perceptible world and put on my image.
      Because it was ignorant, I strengthened it (and) went about preaching the truth to
      everyone. Neither the angelic beings of the world nor the archons saw me, for I negated a
      multitude of [judgments] which brought me near death. 
But an erring multitude I awakened saying, "Know those who are alive and the holy
      seed of Seth. Do not [show] disobedience to me. [Awaken] your divine part to God, and as
      for your sinless elect soul, strengthen it. Behold death here and seek the immutable
      ingenerateness, the [Father] of everything. He invites you, while they reprove you.
      Although they ill-treat 131 you, he will not abandon you. 
Do not baptize yourselves with death nor entrust yourselves to those who are inferior
      to you instead of to those who are better. Flee from the madness and the bondage of
      femaleness and choose for yourselves the salvation of maleness. You have not come to
      suffer; rather, you have come to escape your bondage. 
Release yourselves, and that which has bound you will be dissolved. Save yourselves so
      that your soul may be saved. The kind Father has sent you the Savior and given you
      strength. Why are you hesitating? Seek when you are sought; when you are invited, listen,
      for time is short. 
Do not be led astray. The aeon of the aeons of the living ones is great, yet (so also
      is) the [punishment] of those who are unconvinced. Many bonds and chastisers surround you.
      132 Flee quickly before death reaches you. Look at the Light. Flee
      the Darkness. Do not be led astray to your destruction.
