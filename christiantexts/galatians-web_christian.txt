Galatians












1:1Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither 
through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from 
the dead), 1:2and all the brothers who are with me, 
to the assemblies of Galatia: 1:3Grace to you and peace from God the 
Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, 1:4who gave himself for our sins, that he 
might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God 
and Father--1:5to whom be the glory forever and ever. 
Amen. 
1:6I marvel that you are so quickly 
deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel; 1:7and 
there isn't another gospel. Only there are some who trouble you, and want to 
pervert the Gospel of Christ. 1:8But even though we, or an angel from 
heaven, should preach to you any gospel other than that which we preached to 
you, let him be cursed. 1:9As we have said before, so I now say 
again: if any man preaches to you any gospel other than that which you received, 
let him be cursed. 1:10For am I now seeking the favor of men, 
or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I 
wouldn't be a servant of Christ. 1:11But I make known to you, brothers, 
concerning the Gospel which was preached by me, that it is not according to man. 
1:12For neither did I receive it from man, 
nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ. 1:13For you have heard of my way of living 
in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the 
assembly of God, and ravaged it. 1:14I advanced in the Jews' religion beyond 
many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the 
traditions of my fathers. 1:15But when it was the good pleasure of 
God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace, 1:16to 
reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn't 
immediately confer with flesh and blood, 1:17nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those 
who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to 
Damascus. 1:18Then after three years I went up to 
Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days. 1:19But of the other 
apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord's brother. 1:20Now about the 
things which I write to you, behold, before God, I'm not lying. 1:21Then I came to the regions of Syria and 
Cilicia. 1:22I was still unknown by face to the 
assemblies of Judea which were in Christ, 1:23but they only 
heard: "He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to 
destroy." 1:24And they glorified God in me. 
2:1Then after a period of fourteen years I 
went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me. 2:2I 
went up by revelation, and I laid before them the Gospel which I preach among 
the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I 
might be running, or had run, in vain. 2:3But not even Titus, who was with me, 
being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. 2:4This was because of 
the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty 
which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage; 2:5to 
whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth 
of the Gospel might continue with you. 2:6But from those who were reputed to be 
important (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn't show 
partiality to man)--they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me, 2:7but 
to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Gospel for the 
uncircumcision, even as Peter with the Gospel for the circumcision 2:8(for 
he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also 
to the Gentiles); 2:9and when they perceived the grace that 
was given to me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, 
gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the 
Gentiles, and they to the circumcision. 2:10They only asked us to remember the 
poor--which very thing I was also zealous to do. 
2:11But when Peter came to Antioch, I 
resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned. 2:12For before some 
people came from James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew 
back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. 2:13And the rest of the Jews joined him in 
his hypocrisy; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy. 2:14But when I saw that they didn't walk 
uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel, I said to Peter before them all, 
"If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do 
you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do? 
2:15"We, being Jews by nature, and not 
Gentile sinners, 2:16yet knowing that a man is not justified 
by the works of the law but through the faith of Jesus Christ, even we believed 
in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the 
works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law. 2:17But if, while we sought to be justified 
in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? 
Certainly not! 2:18For if I build up again those things 
which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker. 2:19For I, through the 
law, died to the law, that I might live to God. 2:20I have been 
crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me. 
That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who 
loved me, and gave himself up for me. 2:21I don't make void the grace of God. For 
if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!" 
3:1Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you 
not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth among 
you as crucified? 3:2I just want to learn this from you. Did 
you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith? 3:3Are 
you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh? 
3:4Did you suffer so many things in vain, 
if it is indeed in vain? 3:5He therefore who supplies the Spirit to 
you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by 
hearing of faith? 3:6Even as Abraham "believed God, and it 
was counted to him for righteousness." 3:7Know therefore that those who are of 
faith, the same are children of Abraham. 3:8The Scripture, foreseeing that God would 
justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Gospel beforehand to Abraham, 
saying, "In you all the nations will be blessed." 3:9So then, those who 
are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. 3:10For as many as are 
of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, "Cursed is 
everyone who doesn't continue in all things that are written in the book of the 
law, to do them." 3:11Now that no man is justified by the law 
before God is evident, for, "The righteous will live by faith." 3:12The law is not of faith, but, "The man 
who does them will live by them." 
3:13Christ redeemed us from the curse of 
the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone 
who hangs on a tree," 3:14that the blessing of Abraham might come 
on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the 
Spirit through faith. 3:15Brothers, I speak like men. Though it 
is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, 
or adds to it. 3:16Now the promises were spoken to Abraham 
and to his seed. He doesn't say, "To seeds," as of many, but as of one, "To your 
seed," which is Christ. 3:17Now I say this. A covenant confirmed 
beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years 
after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect. 3:18For if the inheritance is of the law, 
it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise. 
3:19What then is the law? It was added 
because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has 
been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. 3:20Now a mediator is not between one, but 
God is one. 3:21Is the law then against the promises of 
God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, 
most assuredly righteousness would have been of the law. 3:22But the Scriptures 
shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be 
given to those who believe. 3:23But before faith came, we were kept in 
custody under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 
3:24So that the law has become our tutor to 
bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 3:25But now that faith 
has come, we are no longer under a tutor. 3:26For you are all 
children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus. 3:27For as many of you 
as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 3:28There is neither 
Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor 
female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 3:29If you are 
Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise. 
4:1But I say that so long as the heir is a 
child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all; 4:2but 
is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father. 4:3So 
we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elements of the 
world. 4:4But when the fullness of the time came, 
God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law, 4:5that he might redeem 
those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of children. 4:6And 
because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, 
crying, "Abba, Father!" 
4:7So you are no longer a bondservant, but 
a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. 4:8However at that 
time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods. 
4:9But now that you have come to know God, 
or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and 
miserable elements, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again? 4:10You observe days, months, seasons, and 
years. 4:11I am afraid for you, that I might have 
wasted my labor for you. 4:12I beg you, brothers, become as I am, 
for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong, 4:13but you know that 
because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Gospel to you the first time. 4:14That which was a temptation to you in 
my flesh, you didn't despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, 
even as Christ Jesus. 
4:15What was the blessing you enjoyed? For 
I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and 
given them to me. 4:16So then, have I become your enemy by 
telling you the truth? 4:17They zealously seek you in no good way. 
No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them. 4:18But it is always 
good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you. 
4:19My little children, of whom I am again 
in travail until Christ is formed in you-- 4:20but I could wish to 
be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you. 4:21Tell me, you that desire to be under 
the law, don't you listen to the law? 4:22For it is written that Abraham had two 
sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman. 4:23However, the son by 
the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was 
born through promise. 4:24These things contain an allegory, for 
these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, 
which is Hagar. 4:25For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in 
Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with 
her children. 4:26But the Jerusalem that is above is 
free, which is the mother of us all. 4:27For it is written, 
 "Rejoice, you barren who don't 
bear.      Break forth and shout, you that 
don't travail.      For more are the children 
of the desolate than of her who has a husband." 
4:28Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are 
children of promise. 4:29But as then, he who was born according 
to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is 
now. 4:30However what does the Scripture say? 
"Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not 
inherit with the son of the free woman." 4:31So then, brothers, we are not children 
of a handmaid, but of the free woman. 
5:1Stand firm therefore in the liberty by 
which Christ has made us free, and don't be entangled again with a yoke of 
bondage. 5:2Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you 
receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing. 5:3Yes, I testify again 
to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 
5:4You are alienated from Christ, you who 
desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace. 5:5For 
we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness. 5:6For 
in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, 
but faith working through love. 5:7You were running well! Who interfered 
with you that you should not obey the truth? 5:8This persuasion is 
not from him who calls you. 5:9A little yeast grows through the whole 
lump. 5:10I have confidence toward you in the 
Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his 
judgment, whoever he is. 
5:11But I, brothers, if I still preach 
circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling-block of the cross 
has been removed. 5:12I wish that those who disturb you would 
cut themselves off. 5:13For you, brothers, were called for 
freedom. Only don't use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be 
servants to one another. 5:14For the whole law is fulfilled in one 
word, in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." 5:15But if you bite and 
devour one another, be careful that you don't consume one another. 5:16But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you 
won't fulfill the lust of the flesh. 5:17For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, 
and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one other, that you 
may not do the things that you desire. 5:18But if you are led by the Spirit, you 
are not under the law. 5:19Now the works of the flesh are obvious, 
which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness, 5:20idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, 
jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies, 5:21envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, 
and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, 
that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God. 
5:22But the fruit of the Spirit is love, 
joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 5:23gentleness, and 
self-control. Against such things there is no law. 5:24Those who belong to 
Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts. 5:25If we live by the 
Spirit, let's also walk by the Spirit. 5:26Let's not become conceited, provoking 
one another, and envying one another. 
6:1Brothers, even if a man is caught in 
some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of 
gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren't tempted. 6:2Bear 
one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. 6:3For if a man thinks 
himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 6:4But 
let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not 
in his neighbor. 6:5For each man will bear his own burden. 
6:6But let him who is taught in the word 
share all good things with him who teaches. 6:7Don't be deceived. 
God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that will he also reap. 6:8For 
he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who 
sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. 6:9Let us not be weary 
in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don't give up. 6:10So 
then, as we have opportunity, let's do what is good toward all men, and 
especially toward those who are of the household of the faith. 
6:11See with what large letters I write to 
you with my own hand. 6:12As many as desire to look good in the 
flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted 
for the cross of Christ. 6:13For even they who receive circumcision 
don't keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that 
they may boast in your flesh. 6:14But far be it from me to boast, except 
in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been 
crucified to me, and I to the world. 6:15For in Christ Jesus neither is 
circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. 6:16As 
many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God's Israel. 6:17From now on, let no one cause me any 
trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body. 
6:18The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be 
with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
