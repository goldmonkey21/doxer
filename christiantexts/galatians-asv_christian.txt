Galatians












The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 

1:1Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither 
through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from 
the dead), 1:2and all the brethren that are with me, 
unto the churches of Galatia: 1:3Grace to you and peace from God the 
Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, 1:4who gave himself for our sins, that he 
might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our 
God and Father: 1:5to whom be the glory for ever and 
ever. Amen. 1:6I marvel that ye are so quickly removing 
from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel; 1:7which is not another gospel only 
there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 1:8But 
though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than 
that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema. 1:9As we have said 
before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than 
that which ye received, let him be anathema. 1:10For am I now 
seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were 
still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ. 1:11For I make known to 
you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not 
after man. 1:12For neither did I receive it from man, 
nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus 
Christ. 1:13For ye have heard of my manner of life 
in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the 
church of God, and made havoc of it: 1:14and I advanced in the Jews' religion 
beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous 
for the traditions of my fathers. 1:15But when it was the good pleasure of 
God, who separated me, even from my mother's womb, and called me through 
his grace, 1:16to reveal his Son in me, that I might 
preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood: 
1:17neither went I up to Jerusalem to them 
that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned 
unto Damascus. 1:18Then after three years I went up to 
Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days. 1:19But other of the apostles saw I none, 
save James the Lord's brother. 1:20Now touching the things which I write 
unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. 1:21Then I came unto the regions of Syria 
and Cilicia. 1:22And I was still unknown by face unto 
the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: 1:23but they only heard 
say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made 
havoc; 1:24and they glorified God in me. 

2:1Then after the space of fourteen years I 
went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me. 2:2And 
I went up by revelation; and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among 
the Gentiles but privately before them who were of repute, lest by any means I 
should be running, or had run, in vain. 2:3But not even Titus who was with me, 
being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: 2:4and that because of 
the false brethren privily brought in, who came in privily to spy out our 
liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: 2:5to 
whom we gave place in the way of subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth 
of the gospel might continue with you. 2:6But from those who were reputed to be 
somewhat (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth not 
man's person)-- they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me: 2:7but 
contrariwise, when they saw that I had been intrusted with the gospel of the 
uncircumcision, even as Peter with the gospel of the circumcision 2:8(for 
he that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for 
me also unto the Gentiles); 2:9and when they perceived the grace that 
was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be 
pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should 
go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision; 2:10only they 
would that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous 
to do. 2:11But when Cephas came to Antioch, I 
resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned. 2:12For before that 
certain came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew 
back and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision. 2:13And the rest of the Jews dissembled 
likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their 
dissimulation. 2:14But when I saw that they walked not 
uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Cephas before 
them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do 
the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? 2:15We 
being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, 2:16yet knowing that a 
man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, 
even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, 
and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh 
be justified. 2:17But if, while we sought to be justified 
in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a minister of sin? 
God forbid. 2:18For if I build up again those things 
which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor. 2:19For I through the 
law died unto the law, that I might live unto God. 2:20I have been 
crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me: 
and that life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the 
faith which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me. 
2:21I do not make void the grace of God: 
for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nought. 

3:1O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch 
you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified? 3:2This 
only would I learn from you. Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or 
by the hearing of faith? 3:3Are ye so foolish? having begun in the 
Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh? 3:4Did ye suffer so 
many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain. 3:5He therefore that 
supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it 
by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 3:6Even as Abraham 
believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. 3:7Know therefore that 
they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham. 3:8And the scripture, 
foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel 
beforehand unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all the nations be 
blessed. 3:9So then they that are of faith are 
blessed with the faithful Abraham. 3:10For as many as are of the works of the 
law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not 
in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them. 3:11Now that no man is justified by the law 
before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith; 3:12and the law is not of faith; but, He 
that doeth them shall live in them. 3:13Christ redeemed us from the curse of 
the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one 
that hangeth on a tree: 3:14that upon the Gentiles might come the 
blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the 
Spirit through faith. 3:15Brethren, I speak after the manner of 
men: Though it be but a man's covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one 
maketh it void, or addeth thereto. 3:16Now to Abraham were the promises 
spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, 
And to thy seed, which is Christ. 3:17Now this I say: A covenant confirmed 
beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth 
not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect. 3:18For if the 
inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to 
Abraham by promise. 3:19What then is the law? It was added 
because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath 
been made; and it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. 
3:20Now a mediator is not a mediator 
of one; but God is one. 3:21Is the law then against the promises of 
God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, 
verily righteousness would have been of the law. 3:22But the scriptures 
shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be 
given to them that believe. 3:23But before faith came, we were kept in 
ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 
3:24So that the law is become our tutor 
to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 3:25But now faith that is come, we are no 
longer under a tutor. 3:26For ye are all sons of God, through 
faith, in Christ Jesus. 3:27For as many of you as were baptized 
into Christ did put on Christ. 3:28There can be neither Jew nor Greek, 
there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all 
are one man in Christ Jesus. 3:29And if ye are Christ's, then are ye 
Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise. 


4:1But I say that so long as the heir is a 
child, he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all; 4:2but 
is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father. 4:3So 
we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the 
world: 4:4but when the fulness of the time came, 
God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, 4:5that he might redeem 
them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. 4:6And 
because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, 
crying, Abba, Father. 4:7So that thou art no longer a 
bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God. 4:8Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, 
ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods: 4:9but now that ye have 
come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how turn ye back again to the 
weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again? 4:10Ye 
observe days, and months, and seasons, and years. 4:11I am afraid of you, 
lest by any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain. 4:12I beseech you, 
brethren, become as I am, for I also am become as ye are. 
Ye did me no wrong: 4:13but ye know that because of an 
infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time: 4:14and that which was a temptation to you 
in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of 
God, even as Christ Jesus. 4:15Where then is that gratulation of 
yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out 
your eyes and given them to me. 4:16So then am I become your enemy, by 
telling you the truth? 4:17They zealously seek you in no good way; 
nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them. 4:18But it is good to 
be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am 
present with you. 4:19My little children, of whom I am again 
in travail until Christ be formed in you-- 4:20but I could wish to 
be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you. 4:21Tell me, ye that desire to be under the 
law, do ye not hear the law? 4:22For it is written, that Abraham had two 
sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman. 4:23Howbeit the 
son by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the son by the 
freewoman is born through promise. 4:24Which things 
contain an allegory: for these women are two covenants; one from mount 
Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar. 4:25Now this Hagar is 
mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in 
bondage with her children. 4:26But the Jerusalem that is above is 
free, which is our mother. 4:27For it is written, 
 Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; 
 Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: 
 For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath the 
husband. 
4:28Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are 
children of promise. 4:29But as then he that was born after the 
flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, so also it is now. 
4:30Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast 
out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with 
the son of the freewoman. 4:31Wherefore, brethren, we are not 
children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman. 


5:1For freedom did Christ set us free: 
stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage. 5:2Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye 
receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing. 5:3Yea, I testify again 
to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole 
law. 5:4Ye are severed from Christ, ye would be 
justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace. 5:5For we through the 
Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness. 5:6For in Christ Jesus 
neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working 
through love. 5:7Ye were running well; who hindered you 
that ye should not obey the truth? 5:8This persuasion came not of him 
that calleth you. 5:9A little leaven leaveneth the whole 
lump. 5:10I have confidence to you-ward in the 
Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall 
bear his judgment, whosoever he be. 5:11But I, brethren, if I still preach 
circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the 
cross been done away. 5:12I would that they that unsettle you 
would even go beyond circumcision. 5:13For ye, brethren, were called for 
freedom; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but 
through love be servants one to another. 5:14For the whole law is fulfilled in one 
word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 5:15But if ye bite and devour one another, 
take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. 5:16But I say, walk by 
the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. 5:17For the flesh 
lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are 
contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would. 5:18But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are 
not under the law. 5:19Now the works of the flesh are 
manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 5:20idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, 
jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties, 5:21envyings, 
drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did 
forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom 
of God. 5:22But the fruit of the Spirit is love, 
joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 5:23meekness, 
self-control; against such there is no law. 5:24And they that are 
of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts 
thereof. 5:25If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit 
let us also walk. 5:26Let us not become vainglorious, 
provoking one another, envying one another. 

6:1Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in 
any trespass, ye who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of 
gentleness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted. 6:2Bear ye one 
another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. 6:3For if a man 
thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. 6:4But 
let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard 
of himself alone, and not of his neighbor. 6:5For each man shall 
bear his own burden. 6:6But let him that is taught in the word 
communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. 6:7Be not deceived; God 
is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. 6:8For 
he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he 
that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life. 6:9And 
let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint 
not. 6:10So then, as we have opportunity, let us 
work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of 
the household of the faith. 6:11See with how large letters I write unto 
you with mine own hand. 6:12As many as desire to make a fair show 
in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be 
persecuted for the cross of Christ. 6:13For not even they who receive 
circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you 
circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. 6:14But far be it from 
me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world 
hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world. 6:15For neither is 
circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 6:16And as many as shall walk by this rule, 
peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. 6:17Henceforth, let no man trouble me; for 
I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus. 6:18The grace of our 
Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
