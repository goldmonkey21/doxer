TERTULLIAN 
APPENDIX.
AGAINST ALL HERESIES. 
[TRANSLATED BY THE REV. S. THELWALL.]
CHAP. I.--EARLIEST HERETICS: SIMON MAGUS, MENANDER, SATURNINUS, BASILIDES, 
NICOLAUS. [THE WORK BEGINS AS A FRAGMENT.]
Of which heretics I will (to pass by a good deal) summarize some few 
particulars. For of Judaism's heretics I am silent--Dositheus the Samaritan, I 
mean, who was the first who had the hardihood to repudiate the prophets, on 
the ground that they had not spoken under inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Of the 
Sadducees I am silent, who, springing from the root of this error, had the 
hardihood to adjoin to this heresy the denial likewise of the resurrection of 
the flesh. The Pharisees I pretermit, who were "divided" from the Jews by their 
superimposing of certain additaments to the law, which fact likewise made them 
worthy of receiving this very name; and, together with them, the Herodians 
likewise, who said that Herod was Christ. To those I betake myself who have 
chosen to make the gospel the starting-point of their heresies. 
Of these the first of all is Simon Magus, who in the Acts of the Apostles 
earned a condign and just sentence from the Apostle Peter. He had the hardihood 
to call himself the Supreme Virtue, that is, the Supreme God; and moreover, (to 
assert) that the universe had been originated by his angels; that he had 
descended in quest of an erring daemon, which was Wisdom; that, in a phantasmal 
semblance of God, he had not suffered among the Jews, but was as if he had 
suffered. 
After him Menander, his disciple (likewise a magician), saying the same as 
Simon. Whatever Simon had affirmed himself to be, this did Menander equally 
affirm himself to be, asserting that none could possibly have salvation without 
being baptized in his name. 
Afterwards, again, followed Saturninus: he, too, affirming that the 
innascible Virtue, that is God, abides in the highest regions, and that those 
regions are infinite, and in the regions immediately above us; but that angels 
far removed from Him made the lower world; and that, because light from above 
had flashed refulgently in the lower regions, the angels had carefully tried to 
form man after the similitude of that light; that man lay crawling on the 
surface of the earth; that this light and this higher virtue was, thanks to 
mercy, the salvable spark in man, while all the rest of him perishes; that 
Christ had not existed in a bodily substance, and had endured a quasi-passion in 
a phantasmal shape merely; that a resurrection of the flesh there will by no 
means be. 
Afterwards broke out the heretic Basilides. He affirms that there is a 
supreme Deity, by name Abraxas, by whom was created Mind, which in Greek he 
calls Nous; that thence sprang the Word; that of Him issued Providence, 
Virtue, and Wisdom; that out of 
these subsequently were made Principalities, powers, and Angels; that there 
ensued infinite issues and processions of angels; that by these angels 365 
heavens were formed, and the world, in honour of Abraxas, whose name, if 
computed, has in itself this number. Now, among the last of the angels, those 
who made this world, he places the God of the Jews latest, that is, the God of 
the Law and of the Prophets, whom he denies to be a God, but affirms to be an 
angel. To him, he says, was allotted the seed of Abraham, and accordingly he it 
was who transferred the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt into the land of 
Canaan; affirming him to be turbulent above the other angels, and accordingly 
given to the frequent arousing of seditions and wars, yes, and the shedding of 
human blood. Christ, moreover, he affirms to have been sent, not by this maker 
of the world, but by the above-named Abraxas; and to have come in a phantasm, 
and been destitute of the substance of flesh: that it was not He who suffered 
among the Jews, but that Simon was crucified in His stead: whence, again, there 
must be no believing on him who was crucified, lest one confess to having 
believed on Simon. Martyrdoms, he says, are not to be endured. The resurrection 
of the flesh he strenuously impugns, affirming that salvation has not been 
promised to bodies. 
A brother heretic emerged in Nicolaus. He was one of the seven deacons who 
were appointed in the Acts of the Apostles. He affirms that Darkness was seized 
with a concupiscence--and, indeed, a foul and obscene one--after Light: out of 
this permixture it is a shame to say what fetid and unclean (combinations 
arose). The rest (of his tenets), too, are obscene. For he tells of certain 
Aeons, sons of turpitude, and of conjunctions of execrable and obscene embraces 
and per-mixtures, and certain yet baser outcomes of these. 
He teaches that there were born, moreover, daemons, and gods, and spirits 
seven, and other things sufficiently sacrilegious. alike and foul, which we 
blush to recount, and at once pass them by. Enough it is for us that this heresy 
of the Nicolaitans has been condemned by the Apocalypse of the Lord with the 
weightiest authority attaching to a sentence, in saying "Because this thou 
holdest, thou hatest the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I too hate." 
CHAP. II.--OPHITES, CAINITES, SETHITES.
To these are added those heretics likewise who are called Ophites: for they 
magnify the serpent to such a degree, that they prefer him even to Christ 
Himself; for it was he, they say, who gave us the origin of the knowledge of 
good and of evil. His power and majesty (they say) Moses perceiving, set up the 
brazen serpent; and whoever gazed upon him obtained health. Christ Himself (they 
say further) in His gospel imitates Moses' serpent's sacred power, in saying: 
"And as Moses upreared the serpent in the desert, so it behoveth the Son of man 
to be upreared." Him they introduce to bless their eucharistic (elements). Now 
the whole parade and doctrine of this error flowed from the following source. 
They say that from the supreme primary Aeon whom then speak of there emanated 
several other inferior Aeons. To all these, however, there opposed himself an 
Aeon who name is Ialdabaoth. He had been conceived by the permixture of a second 
Aeon with inferior Aeons; and afterwards, when he had been desirous of forcing 
his way into the higher regions, had been disabled by the permixture of the 
gravity of matter with himself to arrive at the higher regions; had been left in 
the midst, and had extended himself to his full dimensions, and thus had made 
the sky. Ialdabaoth, however, had descended lower, and had made him seven sons, 
and had shut from their view the upper regions by self-distension, in order 
that, since (these) angels could not know what was above, they might think him 
the sole God. These inferior Virtues and angels, therefore, had made man; and, 
because he had been originated by weaker and mediocre powers, he lay crawling, 
worm-like. That Aeon, however, out of which Ialdaboath had proceeded, moved to 
the heart with envy, had injected into man as he lay a certain spark; excited 
whereby, he was through prudence to grow wise, and be able to understand the 
things above. So, again, the Ialdaboath aforesaid, turning indignant, had 
emitted out of himself the Virtue and similitude of the serpent; and this had 
been 
the Virtue in paradise--that is, this had been the serpent--whom Eve had 
believed as if he had been God the Son. He plucked, say they, from the fruit of 
the tree, and thus conferred on mankind the knowledge of things good and evil. 
Christ, moreover, existed not in substance of flesh: salvation of the flesh is 
not to be hoped for at all. 
Moreover, also, there has broken out another heresy also, which is called 
that of the Cainites. And the reason is, that they magnify Cain as if he had 
been conceived of some. potent Virtue which operated in him; for Abel had been 
procreated after being conceived of an inferior Virtue, and accordingly had been 
found inferior. They who assert this likewise defend the traitor Judas, telling 
us that he is admirable and great, because of the advantages he is vaunted to 
have conferred on mankind; for some of them think that thanksgiving is to be 
rendered to Judas on this account: viz., Judas, they say, observing that Christ 
wished to subvert the truth, betrayed Him, in order that there might be no 
possibility of truth's being subverted. And others thus dispute against them, 
and say: Because the powers of this world were unwilling that Christ should 
suffer, lest through His death salvation should be prepared for mankind, he, 
consulting for the salvation of mankind, betrayed Christ, in order that there 
might be no possibility at all of the salvation being impeded, which was being 
impeded through the Virtues which were opposing Christ's passion; and thus, 
through the passion of Christ, there might be no possibility of the salvation of 
mankind being retarded. 
But, again, the heresy has started forth which is called that of the 
Sethites. The doctrine of this perversity is as follows. Two human beings were 
formed by the angels--Cain and Abel. On their account arose great contentions 
and discords among the angels; for this reason, that Virtue which was above all 
the Virtues--which they style the Mother--when they said that Abel had been 
slain, willed this Seth of theirs to be conceived and born in place of Abel, in 
order that those angels might be escheated who had created those two former 
human beings, while this pure seed rises and is born. For they say that there 
had been iniquitous permixtures of two angels and human beings; for which reason 
that Virtue which (as we have said) they style the Mother brought on the deluge 
even, for the purpose of vengeance, in order that that seed of permixture might 
be swept away, and this only seed which was pure be kept entire. But (in vain): 
for they who had originated those of the former seed sent into the ark (secretly 
and stealthily, and unknown to that Mother-Virtue), together with those "eight 
souls," the seed likewise of Ham, in order that the seed of evil should not 
perish, but should, together with the rest, be preserved, and after the deluge 
be restored to the earth, and, by example of the rest, should grow up and 
diffuse itself, and fill and occupy the whole orb. Of Christ, moreover, their 
sentiments are such that they call Him merely Seth, and say that He was instead 
of the actual Seth. 
CHAP. III.--CARPOCRATES, CERINTHUS, EBION.
Carpocrates, futhermore, introduced the following sect. He affirms that there 
is one Virtue, the chief among the upper (regions): that out of this were 
produced angels and Virtues, which, being far distant from the upper Virtues, 
created this world in the lower regions: that Christ was not born of the Virgin 
Mary, but was generated--a mere human being--of the seed of Joseph, superior 
(they admit) above all others in the practice of righteousness and in integrity 
of life; that He suffered among the Jews; and that His soul alone was received 
in heaven as having been more firm and hardy than all others: whence he would 
infer, retaining only the salvation of souls, that there are no resurrections of 
the body. 
After him brake out the heretic Cerinthus, teaching similarly. For he, too, 
says that the world was originated by those angels; and sets forth Christ as 
born of the seed of Joseph, contending that He was merely human, without 
divinity; affirming also that the Law was given by angels; representing the God 
of the Jews as not the Lord, but an angel. 
His successor was Ebion, not agreeing with Cerinthus in every point; in that 
he affirms the world to have been made by God, not by angels; and because it is 
written, "No disciple above his master, nor servant above his lord, " sets forth 
likewise the law as binding, of course for the purpose of excluding the gospel 
and vindicating Judaism. 
CHAP. IV.--VALENTINUS, PTOLEMY AND SECUN DUS, HERACLEON.
Valentinus the heretic, moreover, introduced many fables. These I will 
retrench and briefly summarize. For he introduces the Pleroma and the thirty 
Aeons. These Aeons, moreover, he explains in the way of syzygies, that is, 
conjugal unions of some kind. For among the first, he says, were Depth and 
Silence; of these proceeded Mind and Truth; out of whom burst the Word and Life; 
from whom, again, were created Man and the Church. But (these are not all); for 
of these last also proceeded twelve Aeons; from Speech, moreover, and Life 
proceeded other ten Aeons: such is the Triacontad of Aeons, which is made up in 
the Pleroma of an ogdoad, a decad, and a duodecad. The thirtieth Aeon, moreover, 
willed to see the great Bythus; and, to see him, had the hardihood to ascend 
into the upper regions; and not being capable of seeing his magnitude, 
desponded, and almost suffered dissolution, had not some one,--he whom he calls 
Horos, to wit,--sent to invigorate him, strengthened him by pronouncing the word 
"Iao." This Aeon, moreover, which was thus reduced to despondency, he calls 
Achamoth, (and says) that he was seized with certain regretful passions, and out 
of his passions gave birth to material essences. For he was panic-stricken, he 
says, and terror-stricken, and overcome with sadness; and of these passions he 
conceived and bare. Hence he made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and 
whatever is in them: for which cause all things made by him are infirm, and 
frail, and capable of falling, and mortal, inasmuch as he himself was conceived 
and produced from despondency. He, however, originated this world out of those 
material essences which Achamoth, by his panic, or terror, or sadness, or sweat, 
had supplied. For of his panic, he says, was made darkness; of his fear and 
ignorance, the spirits of wickedness and malignity; of his sadness and tears, 
the humidities of founts, the material essence of floods and sea. Christ, 
moreover, was sent by that First-Father who is Bythus. He, moreover, was not in 
the substance of our flesh; but, bringing down from heaven some spiritual body 
or other, passed through the Virgin Mary as water through a pipe, neither 
receiving nor borrowing aught thence. The resurrection of our present flesh he 
denies, but (maintains that) of some sister-flesh. Of the Law and the prophets 
some parts he approves, some he disapproves; that is, he disapproves all in 
reprobating some. A Gospel of his own he likewise has, beside these of ours. 
After him arose the heretics Ptolemy and Secundus, who agree throughout with 
Valentinus, differing only in the following point: viz., whereas Valentinus had 
reigned but thirty Aeons, they have added several more; for they first added 
four, and subsequently four more. And Valentine's assertion, that it was the 
thirtieth Aeon which strayed out from the Pleroma, (as falling into 
despondency,) they deny; for the one which desponded on account of disappointed 
yearning to see the First-Father was not of the original triacontad, they say. 
There arose, besides, Heracleon, a brother-heretic, whose sentiments pair 
with Valentine's; but, by some novelty of terminology, he is desirous of seeming 
to differ in sentiment. For he introduces the notion that there existed first 
what he terms (a Monad); and then out of that Monad (arose) two, and then the 
rest of the Aeons. Then he introduces the whole system of Valentine. 
CHAP. V.--MARCUS AND COLARBASUS.
After these there were not wanting a Marcus and a Colarbasus, composing a 
novel heresy out of the Greek alphabet. For they affirm that without those 
letters truth cannot be found; nay more, that in those letters the whole 
plenitude and perfection of truth is comprised; for this was why Christ said, "I 
am the Alpha and the Omega." In fact, they say that Jesus Christ descended, that 
is, that the dove came down on Jesus; and, since the dove is styled by the Greek 
name peristera-- (peristera), it has in itself this number DCCCI. These 
men run through their W, Y, X, g, T--through the whole 
alphabet, indeed, up to A and B--and compute ogdoads and decads. So we may grant 
it useless and idle to recount all their trifles. What, however, must be allowed 
not merely vain, but likewise dangerous, is this: they feign a second God, 
beside the Creator; they affirm that Christ was not in the substance of flesh; 
they say there is to be no resurrection of the flesh. 
CHAP. VI.--CERDO, MARCION, LUGAN, APELLES.
To this is added one Cerdo. He introduces two first causes, that is, two 
Gods--one good, the other cruel: the good being the superior; the latter, the 
cruel one, being the creator of the world. He repudiates the prophecies and the 
Law; renounces God the Creator; maintains that Christ who came was the Son of 
the superior God; affirms that He was not in the substance of flesh; states Him 
to have been only in a phantasmal shape, to have not really suffered,but 
undergone a quasipassion, and not to have been born of a virgin, nay, really not 
to have been born at all. A resurrection of the soul merely does he approve, 
denying that of the body. The Gospel of Luke alone, and that not entire, does he 
receive. Of the Apostle Paul he takes neither all the epistles, nor in their 
integrity. The Acts of the Apostles and the Apocalypse he rejects as false. 
After him emerged a disciple of his, one Marcion by name, a native of Pontus, 
son of a bishop, excommunicated because of a rape committed on a certain virgin. 
He, starting from the fact that it is said, "Every good tree beareth good fruit, 
but an evil evil," attempted to approve the heresy of Cerdo; so that his 
assertions are identical with those of the former heretic before him. 
After him arose one Lucan by name, a follower and disciple of Marcion. He, 
too, wading through the same kinds of blasphemy, teaches the same as Marcion and 
Cerdo had taught. 
Close on their heels follows Apelles, a disciple of Marcion, who after 
lapsing, into his own carnality, was severed from Marcion. He introduces one God 
in the infinite upper regions, and states that He made many powers and angels; 
beside Him, withal, another Virtue, which he affirms to be called Lord, but 
represents as an angel. By him he will have it appear that the world. was 
originated in imitation of a superior world. With this lower world he mingled 
throughout (a principle of) repentance, because he had not made it so perfectly 
as that superior world had been originated. The Law and the prophets he 
repudiates. Christ he neither, like Marcion, affirms to have been in a 
phantasmal shape, nor yet in substance of a true body, as the Gospel teaches; 
but says, because He descended from the upper regions, that in the course of His 
descent He wove together for Himself a starry and airy flesh; and, in His 
resurrection, restored, in the course of His ascent, to the several individual 
elements whatever had been borrowed in His descent: and thus--the several parts 
of His body dispersed--He reinstated in heaven His spirit only. This man denies 
the resurrection of the flesh. He uses, too, one only apostle; but that is 
Marcion's, that is, a mutilated one. He teaches the salvation of souls alone. 
He has, besides, private but extraordinary lections of his own, which he 
calls "Manifestations, of one Philumene, a girl whom he follows as a prophetess. 
He has, besides, his own books, which he has entitled books of Syllogisms, in 
which he seeks to prove that whatever Moses has written about God is not true, 
but is false. 
CHAP. VII.--TATIAN, CATAPHRYGIANS, CATAPROCLANS, CATHESCHINETANS.
To all these heretics is added one Tatian, a brother-heretic. This man was 
Justin Martyr's disciple. After Justin's death he began to cherish different 
opinions from his. For he wholly savours of Valentinus; adding this, that Adam 
cannot even attain salvation: as if, when the branches become salvable, the root 
were not! 
Other heretics swell the list who are called Cataphrygians, but their 
teaching is not uniform. For there are (of them) same who are called 
Cataproclans; there are others who are termed Cataeschinetans. These have a 
blasphemy common, and a blasphemy not common, but peculiar and special. The 
common blasphemy lies in their saying that the Holy Spirit was in the apostles 
indeed, the Paraclete was not; and in their saying that the Paraclete has spoken 
in Montanus more things than Christ brought forward into (the compass of) the 
Gospel, and not merely more, but likewise better and greater. But the particular 
one they who follow Aeschines have; this, namely, whereby they add this, that 
they affirm Christ to be Himself Son and Father. 
CHAP. VIII.--BLASTUS, TWO THEODOTI, PRAXEAS.
In addition to all these, there is likewise Blastus, who would latently 
introduce Judaism. For he says the passover is not to be kept otherwise than 
according to the law of Moses, on the fourteenth of the month. But who would 
fail to see that evangelical grace is escheated if he recalls Christ to the Law? 

Add to these Theodotus the Byzantine, who, after being apprehended for 
Christ's Name, and apostatizing, ceased not to blaspheme against Christ. For he 
introduced a doctrine by which to affirm that Christ was merely a human being, 
but deny His deity; teaching that He was born of the Holy Spirit indeed of a 
virgin, but was a solitary and bare human being, with no pre-eminence above the 
rest (of mankind), but only that of righteousness. 
After him brake out a second heretical Theodotus, who again himself 
introduced a sister-sect, and says that the human being Christ Himself was 
merely conceived alike, and born, of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, but 
that He was inferior to Melchizedek; because it is said of Christ, "Thou art a 
priest unto eternity, after the order of Melchizedek." For that Melchizedek, he 
says, was a heavenly Virtue of pre-eminent grace; in that Christ acts for human 
beings, being made their Deprecator and Advocate: Melchizedek does so for 
heavenly angels and Virtues. For to such a degree, he says, is he better than 
Christ, that he is apatwr (fatherless), amhtwr (motherless), 
agenealoghtos (without genealogy), of whom neither the beginning nor the 
end has been comprehended, nor can be comprehended. 
But after all these, again, one Praxeas introduced a heresy which Victorinus 
was careful to corroborate. He asserts that Jesus Christ is God the Father 
Almighty. Him he contends to have been crucified, and suffered, and died; beside 
which, with a profane and sacrilegious temerity, he maintains the proposition 
that He is Himself sitting at His own right hand.
