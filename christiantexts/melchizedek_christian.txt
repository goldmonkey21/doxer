      ... the aeons, that I might tell all of the aeons, and, in (the case of) each one of the
      aeons, that I might tell the nature of the aeon, what it is, and that I might put on
      friendship and goodness as a garment, O brother, [...] and ...

      ... at first in parables and riddles [...] proclaim them. Death will tremble and be angry,
      not only he himself, but also his fellow world-ruling archons, and the principalities and
      the authorities, the female gods and the male gods, together with the archangels. And ...

      ... all of them, [...] the world-rulers [...], all of them, and all the [...], and all the

They will say [...] concerning him, and concerning [...] and ...

      will call him 'impious man', 'lawless', 'impure'. And on the third day, he will rise from
      the dead ...

      ... holy disciples. And the Savior will reveal to them the world that gives life to the
      All. 
But those in the heavens spoke many words, together with those on the earth, and those
      under the earth. ... 
... (lines 11-eop unrecoverable)

... which will happen in his name. Furthermore, they will say of him that he is
      unbegotten, though he has been begotten, (that) he does not eat, even though he eats,
      (that) he does not drink, even though he drinks, (that) he is uncircumcised, though he has
      been circumcised, (that) he is unfleshly, though he has come in the flesh, (that) he did
      not come to suffering, <though> he came to suffering, (that) he did not rise from
      the dead, <though> he arose from the dead. 
But all the tribes and all the peoples will speak the truth who are receiving from you
      yourself, O Melchizedek, Holy One, High-Priest, the perfect hope and the gifts of life. I
      am Gamaliel, who was sent to [...] the congregation of the children of Seth, who are above
      thousands of thousands, and myriads of myriads, of the aeons [...] essence of the aeons,
      aba[...] aiai ababa. O divine [...] of the [...] nature [...]! O Mother of the aeons,
      Barbelo! O first-born of the aeons, splendid Doxomedon Dom[...]! O glorious one, Jesus
      Christ! O chief commanders of the luminaries, you powers Armozel, Oroiael, Daveithe,
      Eleleth, and you man-of-light, immortal aeon Pigera-Adamas, and you good god of the
      beneficent worlds, Mirocheirothetou, through Jesus Christ, the Son of God! This is the one
      whom I proclaim, inasmuch as there has visited the One who truly exists, among those who
      exist [...] do(es) not exist, Abel Baruch - that you (sg.) might be given the knowledge of
      the truth [...], that he is from the race of the High-priest, which is above thousands of
      thousands, and myriads of myriads, of the aeons. The adverse spirits are ignorant of him,
      and (of) their (own) destruction. Not only (that, but) I have come to reveal to you the
      truth, which is within the brethren. He included himself in the living offering, together
      with your offspring. He offered them up as an offering to the All. For it is not cattle
      that you will offer up for sin(s) of unbelief, and for the ignorances, and (for) all the
      wicked deeds which they will do [...]. And they do not reach the Father of the All [...]
      the faith ... 
... (20 lines unrecoverable)

For the waters which are above [...] that receive baptism [...]. But receive that
      baptism which is with the water which [...], while he is coming ... 
... (3 lines unrecoverable)
      ... baptism as they ... 
... (18 lines unrecoverable)
      ... pray for the offspring of the archons and all the angels, together with the seed
      <which> flowed forth from the Father of the All [...] the entire [...] from [...]
      there were engendered the gods and the angels, and the men [...] out of the seed, all of
      the natures, those in the heavens and those upon the earth and those under the earth ...

      ... nature of the females [...], among those that are in the [...]. They were bound with
      [...] But this is not (the) true Adam nor (the) true Eve. 
For when they ate of the tree of knowledge, they trampled the Cherubim and the Seraphim
      with the flaming sword. They [...], which was Adam's, [...] the world-rulers, and [...]
      them out [...] after they had brought forth [...] offspring of the archons and their
      worldly things, these belonging to ...

      ... light [...]. And the females and the males, those who exist with [...] hidden from
      every nature, and they will renounce the archons [...] who receive from him the [...]. For
      they are worthy of [...] immortal, and great [...], and great [...], and great [...] sons
      of men [...] disciples [...] image, and [...] from the light [...] which is holy. For
      [...] from the beginning [...] a seed ... 
... (lines 13-eop unrecoverable)

But I will be silent [...], for we are the brethren who came down from the living
      [...]. They will [...] upon the ...

      ... of Adam, [...], Abel, Enoch, Noah, [...] you, Melchizedek, the Priest of God Most
      High, [...] those who [...] women ... 
... (lines 14-eop unrecoverable)
      ... these two who have been chosen will at no time nor in any place will they be
      convicted, whenever they have been begotten, by their enemies, by their friends, nor by
      strangers, nor their (own) kin, (nor) by the impious, nor the pious. All of the adverse
      natures will [...] them, whether those that are manifest, or those that are not manifest,
      together with those that dwell in the heavens, and those that are upon the earth, and
      those that are under the earth. They will make war [...] every one. For [...], whether in
      the ... 
... (3 lines unrecoverable)
      ... many ... 
... (2 lines unrecoverable)
      And these in the [...] every one will [...]. These will [...] with every blow [...]
      weaknesses. These will be confined in other forms, and will be punished. These the Savior
      will take them away, and they will overcome everything, not with their mouths and words,
      but by means of the [...], which will be done for them. He will destroy Death. 
These things which I was commanded to reveal, these things reveal as I (have done). But
      that which is hidden, do not reveal to anyone, unless it is revealed to you (to do
      so)." 
And immediately, I arose, I, Melchizedek, and I began to [...] God [...] that I should
      rejoice ... 
... (1 line unrecoverable)
      ... while he is acting [...] living [...] I said, "I ... 
... (2 lines unrecoverable)
      ... and I will not cease, from now on, forever, O Father of the All, because you have had
      pity on men, and you have sent the angel of light [...] from your aeons [...] to reveal
      [...]. When he came, he caused me to be raised up from ignorance, and (from) the
      fructification of death to life. For I have a name: I am Melchizedek, the Priest of God
      Most High; I know that it is I who am truly the image of the true High-Priest of God Most
      High, and [...] the world. For it is not a small thing that God [...] with [...] while he
      [...]. And [...] the angels that dwell upon the earth ... 
... (2 lines unrecoverable)
      ... is the sacrifice of [...], whom Death deceived. When he died, he bound them with the
      natures which are leading them astray. Yet he offered up offerings [...] cattle, saying,
      "I gave them to Death, and the angels, and the [...] demons [...] living offering
      [...]. I have offered up myself to you as an offering, together with those that are mine,
      to you yourself, (O) Father of the All, and those whom you love, who have come forth from
      you who are holy (and) living. And <according to> the perfect laws, I shall
      pronounce my name as I receive baptism now (and) forever, (as a name) among the living
      (and) holy names, and (now) in the waters. Amen." 
Holy are you, Holy are you, Holy are you, O Father of the All, who truly exists, [...]

Holy are you, Holy are you, Holy are you, Mother of the aeons, Barbelo, for ever and
      ever, Amen.

      High-priest of God Most High, for the archons, who are your enemies, made war; (but) you
      have prevailed over them, and they did not prevail over you, and you endured, and you

      revelations, do not reveal to anyone in the flesh, since they are incorporeal, unless it
      is revealed to you (to do so)." 
When the brethren who belong to the generations of life had said these things, they
      were taken up to (the regions) above all the heavens. Amen.
