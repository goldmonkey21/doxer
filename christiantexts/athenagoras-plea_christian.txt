ATHENAGORAS 
[TRANSLATED BY THE REV. B. P. PRATTEN.] 
A PLEA FOR THE CHRISTIANS BY ATHENAGORAS THE ATHENIAN: PHILOSOPHER AND 
CHRISTIAN 
To the Emperors Marcus Aurelius Anoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus, 
conquerors of Armenia and Sarmatia, and more than all, philosophers. 
CHAP. I.--INJUSTICE SHOWN TOWARDS THE CHRISTIANS. 
In your empire, greatest of sovereigns, different nations have different 
customs and laws; and no one is hindered by law or fear of punishment from 
following his ancestral usages, however ridiculous these may be. A citizen of 
Ilium calls Hector a god, and pays divine honours to Helen, taking her for 
Adrasteia. The Lacedaemonian venerates Agamemnon as Zeus, and Phylonoe the 
daughter of Tyndarus; and the man of Tenedos worships Tennes. The Athenian 
sacrifices to Erechtheus as Poseidon. The Athenians also perform religious rites 
and celebrate mysteries in honour of Agraulus and Pandrosus, women who were 
deemed guilty of impiety for opening the box. In short, among every nation and 
people, men offer whatever sacrifices and celebrate whatever mysteries they 
please. The Egyptians reckon among their gods even cats, and crocodiles, and 
serpents, and asps, and dogs. And to all these both you and the laws give 
permission so to act, deeming, on the one hand, that to believe in no god at all 
is impious and wicked, and on the other, that it is necessary for each man to 
worship the gods he prefers, in order that through fear of the deity, men may be 
kept from wrong-doing. But why--for do not, like the multitude, be led astray by 
hearsay--why is a mere name odious to you? 
Names are not deserving of hatred: it is the unjust act that calls for 
penalty and punishment. And accordingly, with admiration of your mildness and 
gentleness, and your peaceful and benevolent disposition towards every man, 
individuals live in the possession of equal rights; and the cities, according to 
their rank, share in equal honour; and the whole empire, under your intelligent 
sway, enjoys profound peace. But for us who are called Christians you have not 
in like manner cared; but although we commit no wrong--nay, as will appear in 
the sequel of this discourse, are of all men most piously and righteously 
disposed towards the Deity and towards your government--you allow us to be 
harassed, plundered, and persecuted, the multitude making war upon us for our 
name alone. We venture, therefore, to lay a statement of our case before 
you--and you will team from this discourse that we suffer unjustly, and contrary 
to all law and reason--and we beseech you to bestow some consideration upon us 
also, that we may cease at length to be slaughtered at the instigation of false 
accusers. For the fine imposed by our persecutors does not aim merely at our 
property, nor their insults at our reputation, nor the damage they do us at any 
other of our greater interests. 
These we hold in contempt, though to the generality they appear matters of 
great importance; for we have learned, not only not to return blow for blow, nor 
to go to law with those who plunder and rob us, but to those who smite us on one 
side of the face to offer the other side also, and to those who take away our 
coat to give likewise our cloak. But, when we have surrendered our property, 
they plot against our very bodies and souls, pouring upon us wholesale charges 
of crimes of which we are guiltless even in thought, but which belong to these 
idle praters themselves, and to the whole tribe of those who are like them. 
CHAP. II.--CLAIM TO BE TREATED AS OTHERS ARE WHEN ACCUSED. 
If, indeed, any one can convict us of a crime, be it small or great, we do 
not ask to be excused from punishment, but are prepared to undergo the sharpest 
and most merciless inflictions. But if the accusation relates merely to our 
name--and it is undeniable, that up to the present time the stories told about 
us rest on nothing better than the common undiscriminating popular talk, nor has 
any Christian been convicted of crime--it will devolve on you, illustrious and 
benevolent and most learned sovereigns, to remove by law this despiteful 
treatment, so that, as throughout the world both individuals and cities partake 
of your beneficence, we also may feel grateful to you, exulting that we are no 
longer the victims of false accusation. For it does not comport with your 
justice, that others when charged with crimes should not be punished till they 
are convicted, but that in our case the name we bear should have more force than 
the evidence adduced on the trial, when the judges, instead of inquiring whether 
the person arraigned have committed any crime, vent their insults on the name, 
as if that were itself a crime. But no name in and by itself is reckoned either 
good or bad; names appear bad or good according as the actions underlying them 
are bad or good. You, however, have yourselves a dear knowledge of this, since 
you are well instructed in philosophy and all learning. For this reason, too, 
those who are brought before you for trial, though they may be arraigned on the 
gravest charges, have no fear, because they know that you will inquire 
respecting their previous life, and not be influenced by names if they mean 
nothing, nor by the charges contained in the indictments if they should be 
false: they accept with equal satisfaction, as regards its fairness, the 
sentence whether of condemnation or acquittal. What, therefore, is conceded as 
the common right of all, we claim for ourselves, that we shall not be hated and 
punished because we are called Christians (for what has the name to do with our 
being bad men?), but be tried on any charges which may be brought against us, 
and either be released on our disproving them, or punished if convicted of 
crime--not for the name (for no Christian is a bad man unless he falsely profess 
our doctrines), but for the wrong which has been done. It is thus that we see 
the philosophers judged. None of them before trial is deemed by the judge either 
good or bad on account of his science or art, but if found guilty of wickedness 
he is punished, without thereby affixing any stigma on philosophy (for he is a 
bad man for not cultivating philosophy in a lawful manner, but science is 
blameless), while if he refutes the false charges he is acquitted. Let this 
equal justice, then, be done to us. Let the life of the accused persons be 
investigated, but let the name stand free from all imputation. I must at the 
outset of my defence entreat you, illustrious emperors, to listen to me 
impartially: not to be carried away by the common irrational talk and prejudge 
the case, but to apply your desire of knowledge and love of truth to the 
examination of our doctrine also. Thus, while you on your part will not err 
through ignorance, we also, by disproving the charges arising out of the 
undiscerning rumour of the multitude, shall cease to be assailed. 
CHAP. III.--CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST THE CHRISTIANS. 
Three things are alleged against us: atheism, Thyestean feasts, OEdipodean 
intercourse. But if these charges are true, spare no class: proceed at once 
against our crimes; destroy us root and branch, with our wives and children, if 
any Christian is found to live like the brutes. And yet even the brutes do not 
touch the flesh of their own kind; and they pair by a law of nature, and only at 
the regular season, not from simple wantonness; they also recognise those from 
whom they receive benefits. If any one, therefore, is more savage than the 
brutes, what punishment that he can endure shall be deemed adequate to such 
offences? But, if these things are only idle tales and empty slanders, 
originating in the fact that virtue is opposed by its very nature to vice, and 
that contraries war against one another by a divine law (and you are yourselves 
witnesses that no such iniquities are committed by us, for you forbid 
informations to be laid against us), it remains for you to make inquiry 
concerning our life, our opinions, our loyalty and obedience to you and your 
house and government, and thus at length to grant to us the same rights (we ask 
nothing more) as to those who persecute us. For we shall then conquer them, 
unhesitatingly surrendering, as we now do, our very lives for the truth's sake. 
CHAP. IV.--THE CHRISTIANS ARE NOT ATHEISTS, BUT ACKNOWLEDGE ONE ONLY GOD. 
As regards, first of all, the allegation that we are atheists--for I will 
meet the charges one by one, that we may not be ridiculed for having no answer 
to give to those who make them--with reason did the Athenians adjudge Diagoras 
guilty of atheism, in that he not only divulged the Orphic doctrine, and 
published the mysteries of Eleusis and of the Cabiri, and chopped up the wooden 
statue of Hercules to boil his turnips, but openly declared that there was no 
God at all. But to us, who distinguish God from matter, and teach that matter is 
one thing and God another, and that they are separated by a wide interval (for 
that the Deity is uncreated and eternal, to be beheld by the understanding and 
reason alone, while matter is created and perishable), is it not absurd to apply 
the name of atheism? If our sentiments were like those of Diagoras, while we 
have such incentives to piety--in the established order, the universal harmony, 
the magnitude, the colour, the form, the arrangement of the world--with reason 
might our reputation for impiety, as well as the cause of our being thus 
harassed, be charged on ourselves. But, since our doctrine acknowledges one God, 
the Maker of this universe, who is Himself uncreated (for that which is does not 
come to be, but that which is not) but has made all things by the Logos which is 
from Him, we are treated unreasonably in both respects, in that we are both 
defamed and persecuted. 
CHAP. V.--TESTIMONY OF THE POETS TO THE UNITY OF GOD. 
Poets and philosophers have not been voted atheists for inquiring concerning 
God. Euripides, speaking of those who, according to popular preconception, are 
ignorantly called gods, says doubtingly:- "If Zeus indeed does reign in heaven 
above, He ought not on the righteous ills to send." But speaking of Him who is 
apprehended by the understanding as matter of certain knowledge, he gives his 
opinion decidedly, and with intelligence, thus:- "Seest thou on high him who, 
with humid arms, Clasps both the boundless ether and the earth? Him reckon Zeus, 
and him regard as God." 
For, as to these so-called gods, he neither saw any real existences, to which 
a name is usually assigned, underlying them ("Zeus," for instance: "who Zeus is 
I know not, but by report"), nor that any names were given to realities which 
actually do exist (for of what use are names to those who have no real 
existences underlying them?); but Him he did see by means of His works, 
considering with an eye to things unseen the things which are manifest in air, 
in ether, on earth. Him therefore, from whom proceed all created things, and by 
whose Spirit they are governed, he concluded to be God; and Sophocles agrees 
with him, when he says:- "There is one God, in truth there is but one, Who made 
the heavens, and the broad earth beneath." 
[Euripides is speaking] of the nature of God, which fills His works with 
beauty, and teaching both where God must be, and that He must be One. 
CHAP. VI.--OPINIONS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS AS TO THE ONE GOD. 
Philolaus, too, when he says that all things are included in God as in a 
stronghold, teaches that He is one, and that He is superior to matter. Lysis and 
Opsimus thus define God: the one says that He is an ineffable number, the other 
that He is the excess of the greatest number beyond that which comes nearest to 
it. So that since ten is the greatest number according to the Pythagoreans, 
being the Tetractys, and containing all the arithmetic and harmonic principles, 
and the Nine stands next to it, God is a unit--that is, one. For the greatest 
number exceeds the next least by one. Then there are Plato and Aristotle--not 
that I am about to go through all that the philosophers have said about God, as 
if I wished to exhibit a complete summary of their opinions; for I know that, as 
you excel all men in intelligence and in the power of your rule, in the same 
proportion do you surpass them all in an accurate acquaintance with all 
learning, cultivating as you do each several branch with more success than even 
those who have devoted themselves exclusively to any one. But, inasmuch as it is 
impossible to demonstrate without the citation of names that we are not alone in 
confining the notion of God to unity, I have ventured on an enumeration of 
opinions. Plato, then, says, "To find out the Maker and Father of this universe 
is difficult; and, when found, it is impossible to declare Him to all," 
conceiving of one uncreated and eternal God. And if he recognises others as 
well, such as the sun, moon, and stars, yet he recognises them as created: 
"gods, offspring of gods, of whom I am the Maker, and the Father of works which 
are indissoluble apart from my will; but whatever is compounded can be 
dissolved." If, therefore, Plato is not an atheist for conceiving of one 
uncreated God, the Framer of the universe, neither are we atheists who 
acknowledge and firmly hold that He is God who has framed all things by the 
Logos, and holds them in being by His Spirit. Aristotle, again, and his 
followers, recognising the existence of one whom they regard as a sort of 
compound living creature (zwon), speak of God as consisting of soul and 
body, thinking His body to be the etherial space and the planetary stars and the 
sphere of the fixed stars, moving in circles; but His soul, the reason which 
presides over the motion of the body, itself not subject to motion, but becoming 
the cause of motion to the other. The Stoics also, although by the appellations 
they employ to suit the changes of matter, which they say is permeated by the 
Spirit of God, they multiply the Deity in name, yet in reality they consider God 
to be one. 
For, if God is an artistic fire advancing methodically to the production of 
the several things in the world, embracing in Himself all the seminal principles 
by which each thing is produced in accordance with fate, and if His Spirit 
pervades the whole world, then God is one according to them, being named Zeus in 
respect of the fervid part (to zeon) of matter, and Hera in 
respect of the air (o ahr), and called by other names in respect 
of that particular part of matter which He pervades. 
CHAP. VII.--SUPERIORITY OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE RESPECTING GOD. 
Since, therefore, the unity of the Deity is confessed by almost all, even 
against their will, when they come to treat of the first principles of the 
universe, and we in our turn likewise assert that He who arranged this universe 
is God,--why is it that they can say and write with impunity what they please 
concerning the Deity, but that against us a law lies in force, though we are 
able to demonstrate what we apprehend and justly believe, namely that there is 
one God, with proofs and reason accordant with truth? For poets and 
philosophers, as to other subjects so also to this, have applied themselves in 
the way of conjecture, moved, by reason of their affinity with the afflatus from 
God, each one by his own soul, to try whether he could find out and apprehend 
the truth; but they have not been found competent fully to apprehend it, because 
they thought fit to learn, not from God concerning God, but each one from 
himself; hence they came each to his own conclusion respecting God, and matter, 
and forms, and the world. But we have for witnesses of the things we apprehend 
and believe, prophets, men who have pronounced concerning God and the things of 
God, guided by the Spirit of God. And you too will admit, excelling all others 
as you do in intelligence and in piety towards the true God (to
ontws qeion), that it would be irrational for us to cease to 
believe in the Spirit from God, who moved the mouths of the prophets like 
musical instruments, and to give heed to mere human opinions. 
CHAP. VIII.--ABSURDITIES OF POLYTHEISM. 
As regards, then, the doctrine that there was from the beginning one God, the 
Maker of this universe, consider it in this wise, that you may be acquainted 
with the argumentative grounds also of our faith. If there were from the 
beginning two or more gods, they were either in one and the same place, or each 
of them separately in his own. In one and the same place they could not be. For, 
if they are gods, they are not alike; but because they are uncreated they are 
unlike:-- for created things are like their patterns; but the uncreated are 
unlike, being neither produced from any one, nor formed after the pattern of any 
one. Hand and eye and foot are parts of one body, making up together one man: is 
God in this sense one? And indeed Socrates was compounded and divided into 
parts, just because he was created and perishable; but God is uncreated, and, 
impassible, and indivisible--does not, therefore, consist of parts. But if, on 
the contrary, each of them exists separately, since He that made the world is 
above the things created, and about the things He has made and set in order, 
where can the other or the rest be? For if the world, being made spherical, is 
confined within the circles of heaven, and the Creator of the world is above the 
things created, managing that by His providential care of these, what place is 
there for the second god, or for the other gods? For he is not in the world, 
because it belongs to the other; nor about the world, for God the Maker of the 
world is above it. But if he is neither in the world nor about the world (for 
all that surrounds it is occupied by this one), where is he? Is he above the 
world and [the first] God? In another world, or about another? But if he is in 
another or about another, then he is not about us, for he does not govern the 
world; nor is his power great, for he exists in a circumscribed space. But if he 
is neither in another world (for all things are filled by the other), nor about 
another (for all things are occupied by the other), he clearly does not exist at 
all, for there is no place in which he can be. Or what does he do, Seeing there 
is another to whom the world belongs, and he is above the Maker of the world, 
and yet is neither in the world nor about the world? Is there, then, some other 
place where he can stand? But God, and what belongs to God, are above him. And 
what, too, shall be the place, seeing that the other fills the regions which are 
above the world? Perhaps he exerts a providential care? [By no means.] And yet, 
unless he does so, he has done nothing. If, then, he neither does anything nor 
exercises providential care, and if there is not another place in which he is, 
then this Being of whom we speak is the one God from the beginning, and the sole 
Maker of the world. 
CHAP. IX.--THE TESTIMONY OF THE PROPHETS. 
If we satisfied ourselves with advancing such considerations as these, our 
doctrines might by some be looked upon as human. But, since the voices of the 
prophets confirm our arguments--for I think that you also, with your great zeal 
for knowledge, and your great attainments in learning, cannot be ignorant of the 
writings either of Moses or of Isaiah and Jeremiah, and the other prophets, who, 
lifted in ecstasy above the natural operations of their minds by the impulses of 
the Divine Spirit, uttered the things with which they were inspired, the Spirit 
making use of them as a flute-player breathes into a flute;--what, then, do 
these men say? The LORD is our God; no other can be compared with Him." And 
again: "I am God, the first and the last, and besides Me there is no God." In 
like manner: "Before Me there was no other God, and after Me there shall be 
none; I am God, and there is none besides Me." And as to His greatness: "Heaven 
is My throne, and the earth is the footstool of My feet: what house win ye build 
for Me, or what is the place of My rest?" But I leave it to you, when you meet 
with the books themselves, to examine carefully the prophecies contained in 
them, that you may on fitting grounds defend us from the abuse cast upon us. 
CHAP. X.--THE CHRISTIANS WORSHIP THE FATHER, SON, AND HOLY GHOST. 
That we are not atheists, therefore, seeing that we acknowledge one God, 
uncreated, eternal, invisible, impassible, incomprehensible, illimitable, who is 
apprehended by the understanding only and the reason, who is encompassed by 
light, and beauty, and spirit, and power ineffable, by whom the universe has 
been created through His Logos, and set in order, and is kept in being--I have 
sufficiently demonstrated. [I say "His Logos"], for we acknowledge also a Son of 
God. Nor let any one think it ridiculous that God should have a Son. For though 
the poets, in their fictions, represent the gods as no better than men, our mode 
of thinking is not the same as theirs, concerning either God the Father or the 
Son. But the Son of God is the Logos of the Father, in idea and in operation; 
for after the pattern of Him and by Him were all things made, the Father and the 
Son being one. And, the Son being in the Father and the Father in the Son, in 
oneness and power of spirit, the understanding and reason (nous
kai logos) of the Father is the Son of God. But if, in your 
surpassing intelligence, it occurs to you to inquire what is meant by the Son, I 
will state briefly that He is the first product of the Father, not as having 
been brought into existence (for from the beginning, God, who is the eternal 
mind [nous], had the Logos in Himself, being from eternity instinct with 
Logos [logikos]; but inasmuch as He came forth to be the idea and 
energizing power of all material things, which lay like a nature without 
attributes, and an inactive earth, the grosser particles being mixed up with the 
lighter. The prophetic Spirit also agrees with our statements. "The Lord," it 
says, "made me, the beginning of His ways to His works." The Holy Spirit Himself 
also, which operates in the prophets, we assert to be an effluence of God, 
flowing from Him, and returning back again like a beam of the sun. Who, then, 
would not be astonished to hear men who speak of God the Father, and of God the 
Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and who declare both their power in union and their 
distinction in order, called atheists? Nor is our teaching in what relates to 
the divine nature confined to these points; but we recognise also a multitude of 
angels and ministers, whom God the Maker and Framer of the world distributed and 
ap pointed to their several posts by His Logos, to occupy themselves about the 
elements, and the heavens, and the world, and the things in it, and the goodly 
ordering of them all. 
CHAP. XI.--THE MORAL TEACHING OF THE CHRISTIANS REPELS THE CHARGE BROUGHT 
AGAINST THEM. 
If I go minutely into the particulars of our doctrine, let it not surprise 
you. It is that you may not be carried away by the popular and irrational 
opinion, but may have the truth clearly before you. For presenting the opinions 
themselves to which we adhere, as being not human but uttered and taught by God, 
we shall be able to persuade you not to think of us as atheists. What, then, are 
those teachings in which we are brought up? "I say unto you, Love your enemies; 
bless them that curse you; pray for them that persecute you; that ye may be the 
sons of your Father who is in heaven, who causes His sun to rise on the evil and 
the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust." Allow me here to lift up 
my voice boldly in loud and audible outcry, pleading as I do before philosophic 
princes. For who of those that reduce syllogisms, and clear up ambiguities, and 
explain etymologies, or of those who teach homonyms and synonyms, and 
predicaments and axioms, and what is the subject and what the predicate, and who 
promise their disciples by these and such like instructions to make them happy: 
who of them have so purged their souls as, instead of hating their enemies, to 
love them; and, instead of speaking ill of those who have reviled them (to 
abstain from which is of itself an evidence of no mean forbearance), to bless 
them; and to pray for those who plot against their lives? On the contrary, they 
never cease with evil intent to search out skilfully the secrets of their art, 
and are ever bent on working some ill, making the art of words and not the 
exhibition of deeds their business and profession. But among us you will find 
uneducated persons, and artisans, and old women, who, if they are unable in 
words to prove the benefit of our doctrine, yet by their deeds exhibit the 
benefit arising from their persuasion of its truth: they do not rehearse 
speeches, but exhibit good works; when struck, they do not strike again; when 
robbed, they do not go to law; they give to those that ask of them, and love 
their neighbours as themselves. 
CHAP. XII.--CONSEQUENT ABSURDITY OF THE CHARGE OF ATHEISM. 
Should we, then, unless we believed that a God presides over the human race, 
thus purge ourselves from evil? Most certainly not. But, because we are 
persuaded that we shall give an account of everything in the present life to 
God, who made us and the world, we adopt a temperate and benovolent and 
generally despised method of life, believing that we shall suffer no such great 
evil here, even should our lives be taken from us, compared with what we shall 
there receive for our meek and benevolent and moderate life from the great 
Judge. Plato indeed has said that Minos and Rhadamanthus will judge and punish 
the wicked; but we say that, even if a man be Minos or Rhadamanthus himself, or 
their father, even he will not escape the judgment of God. Are, then, those who 
consider life. to be comprised in this, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we 
die," and who regard death as a deep sleep and forgetfulness ("sleep and death, 
twin-brothers" ), to be accounted pious; while men who reckon the present life 
of very small worth indeed, and who are conducted to the future life by this one 
thing alone, that they know God and His Logos, what is the oneness of the Son 
with the Father, what the communion of the Father with the Son, what is the 
Spirit, what is the unity of these three, the Spirit, the Son, the Father, and 
their distinction in unity; and who know that the life for which we look is far 
better than can be described in words, provided we arrive at it pure from all 
wrong-doing; who, moreover, carry our benevolence to such an extent, that we not 
only love our friends ("for if ye love them," He says, "that love you, and lend 
to them that lend to you, what reward will ye have?" ),--shall we, I say, when 
such is our character, and when we live such a life as this, that we may escape 
condemnation at last, not be accounted pious? These, however, are only small 
matters taken from great, and a few things from many, that we may not further 
trespass on your patience; for those who test honey and whey, judge by a small 
quantity whether the whole is good. 
CHAP. XIII.--WHY THE CHRISTIANS DO NOT OFFER SACRIFICES. 
But, as most of those who charge us with atheism, and that because they have 
not even the dreamiest conception of what God is, and are doltish and utterly 
unacquainted with natural and divine things, and such as measure piety by the 
rule of sacrifices, charges us with not acknowledging the same gods as the 
cities, be pleased to attend to the following considerations, O emperors, on 
both points. And first, as to our not sacrificing: the Framer and Father of this 
universe does not need blood, nor the odour of burnt-offerings, nor the 
fragrance of flowers and incense, forasmuch as He is Himself perfect fragrance, 
needing nothing either within or without; but the noblest sacrifice to Him is 
for us to know who stretched out and vaulted the heavens, and fixed the earth in 
its place like a centre, who gathered the water into seas and divided the light 
from the darkness, who adorned the sky with stars and made the earth to bring 
forth seed of every kind, who made animals and fashioned man. When, holding God 
to be this Framer of all things, who preserves them in being and superintends 
them all by knowledge and administrative skill, we "lift up holy hands" to Him, 
what need has He further of a hecatomb? "For they, when mortals have 
transgress'd or fail'd To do aright, by sacrifice and pray'r, Libations and 
burnt-offerings, may be soothed." 
And what have I to do with holocausts, which God does not stand in need 
of?--though indeed it does behove us to offer a bloodless sacrifice and "the 
service of our reason." 
CHAP. XIV.--INCONSISTENCY OF THOSE WHO ACCUSE THE CHRISTIANS. 
Then, as to the other complaint, that we do not pray to and believe in the 
same gods as the cities, it is an exceedingly silly one. Why, the very men who 
charge us with atheism for not admitting the same gods as they acknowledge, are 
not agreed among themselves concerning the gods. The Athenians have set up as 
gods Celeus and Metanira: the Lacedaemonians Menelaus; and they offer sacrifices 
and hold festivals to him, while the men of Ilium cannot endure the very sound 
of his name, and pay their adoration to Hector. The Ceans worship Aristaeus, 
considering him to be the same as Zeus and Apollo; the Thasians Theagenes, a man 
who committed murder at the Olympic games; the Samians Lysander, notwithstanding 
all the slaughters and all the crimes perpetrated by him; Alcman and Hesiod 
Medea, and the Cilicians Niobe; the Sicilians Philip the son of Butacides; the 
Amathusians Onesilus; the Carthaginians Hamilcar. 
Time would fail me to enumerate the whole. When, therefore, they differ among 
themselves concerning their gods, why do they bring the charge against us of not 
agreeing with them? Then look at the practices prevailing among the Egyptians: 
are they not perfectly ridiculous? For in the temples at their solemn festivals 
they beat their breasts as for the dead, and sacrifice to the same beings as 
gods; and no wonder, when they look upon the brutes as gods, and shave 
themselves when they die, and bury them in temples, and make public lamentation. 
If, then, we are guilty of impiety because we do not practise a piety 
corresponding with theirs, then all cities and all nations are guilty of 
impiety, for they do not all acknowledge the same gods. 
CHAP. XV.--THE CHRISTIANS DISTINGUISH GOD FROM MATTER. 
But grant that they acknowledge the same. What then? Because the multitude, 
who cannot distinguish between matter and God, or see how great is the interval 
which lies between them, pray to idols made of matter, are we therefore, who do 
distinguish and separate the uncreated and the created, that which is and that 
which is not, that which is apprehended by the understanding and that which is 
perceived by the senses, and who give the fitting name to each of them,--are we 
to come and worship images? If, indeed, matter and God are the same, two names 
for one thing, then certainly, in not regarding stocks and stones, gold and 
silver, as gods, we are guilty of impiety. But if they are at the greatest 
possible remove from one another--as far asunder as the artist and the materials 
of his art--why are we called to account? For as is the potter and the clay 
(matter being the clay, and the artist the potter), so is God, the Framer of the 
world, and matter, which is subservient to Him for the purposes of His art. But 
as the clay cannot become vessels of itself without art, so neither did matter, 
which is capable of taking all forms, receive, apart from God the Framer, 
distinction and shape and order. And as we do not hold the pottery of more worth 
than him who made it, nor the vessels or glass and gold than him who wrought 
them; but if there is anything about them elegant in art we praise the 
artificer, and it is he who reaps the glory of the vessels: even so with matter 
and God --the glory and honour of the orderly arrangement of the world belongs 
of right not to matter, but to God, the Framer of matter. So that, if we were to 
regard the various forms of matter as gods, we should seem to be without any 
sense of the true God, because we should be putting the things which are 
dissoluble and perishable on a level with that which is eternal. 
CHAP. XVI.--THE CHRISTIANS DO NOT WORSHIP THE UNIVERSE. 
Beautiful without doubt is the world, excelling, as well in its magnitude as 
in the arrangement of its parts, both those in the oblique circle and those 
about the north, and also in its spherical form. Yet it is not this, but its 
Artificer, that we must worship. For when any of your subjects come to you, they 
do not neglect to pay their homage to you, their rulers and lords, from whom 
they will obtain whatever they need, and address themselves to the magnificence 
of your palace; but, if they chance to come upon the royal residence, they 
bestow a passing glance of admiration on its beautiful structure: but it is to 
you yourselves that they show honour, as being "all in all." You sovereigns, 
indeed, rear and adorn your palaces for yourselves; but the world was not 
created because God needed it; for God is Himself everything to Himself,--light 
unapproachable, a perfect world, spirit, power, reason. If, therefore, the world 
is an instrument in tune, and moving in well-measured time, I adore the Being 
who gave its harmony, and strikes its notes, and sings the accordant strain, and 
not the instrument. For at the musical contests the adjudicators do not pass by 
the lute-players and crown the lutes. Whether, then, as Plato says, the world be 
a product of divine art, I admire its beauty, and adore the Artificer; or 
whether it be His essence and body, as the Peripatetics affirm, we do not 
neglect to adore God, who is the cause of the motion of the body, and descend 
"to the poor and weak elements," adoring in the impassible air (as they term 
it), passible matter; or, if any one apprehends the several parts of the world 
to be powers of God, we do not approach and do homage to the powers, but their 
Maker and Lord. I do not ask of matter what it has not to give, nor passing God 
by do I pay homage to the elements, which can do nothing more than what they 
were bidden; for, although they are beautiful to look upon, by reason of the art 
of their Framer, yet they still have the nature of matter. And to this view 
Plato also bears testimony; "for," says he, "that which is called heaven and 
earth has received many blessings from the Father, but yet partakes of body; 
hence it cannot possibly be free from' change." If, therefore, while I admire 
the heavens and the elements in respect of their art, I do not worship them as 
gods, knowing that the law of dissolution is upon them, how can I call those 
objects gods of which I know the makers to be men? Attend, I beg, to a few words 
on this subject. 
CHAP. XVII.--THE NAMES OF THE GODS AND THEIR IMAGES ARE BUT OF RECENT DATE. 
An apologist must adduce more precise arguments than I have yet given, both 
concering the names of the gods, to show that they are of recent origin, and 
concerning their images, to show that they are, so to say, but of yesterday. You 
yourselves, however, are thoroughly acquainted with these matters, since you are 
versed in all departments of knowledge, and are beyond all other men familiar 
with the ancients. I assert, then, that it was Orpheus, and Homer, and Hesiod 
who s gave both genealogies and names to those whom they call gods. Such, too, 
is the testimony of Herodotus. "My opinion," he says, "is that Hesiod and Homer 
preceded me by four hundred years, and no more; and it was they who framed a 
theogony for the Greeks, and gave the gods their names, and assigned them their 
several honours and functions, and described their forms." Representations of 
the gods, again, were not in use at all, so long as statuary, and painting, and 
sculpture were unknown; nor did they become common until Saurias the Samian, and 
Crato the Sicyonian, and Cleanthes the Corinthian, and the Corinthian damsel 
appeared, when drawing in outline was invented by Saurias, who sketched a horse 
in the sun, and painting by Crato, who painted in oil on a whitened tablet the 
outlines of a man and woman; and the art of making figures in relief 
(koroplaqikh) was invented by the damsel, who, being in love with a 
person, traced his shadow on a wall as he lay asleep, and her father, being 
delighted with the exactness of the resemblance (he was a potter), carved out 
the sketch and filled it up with clay: this figure is still preserved at 
Corinth. After these, Daedalus and Theodorus the Milesian further invented 
sculpture and statuary. You perceive, then, that the time since representations 
of form and the making of images began is so short, that we can name the artist 
of each particular god. The image of Artemis at Ephesus, for example, and that 
of Athena (or rather of Athela, for so is she named by those who speak more in 
the style of the mysteries; for thus was the ancient image made of the 
olive-tree called), and the sitting figure of the same goddess, were made by 
Endoeus, a pupil of Daedalus; the Pythian god was the work of Theodorus and 
Telecles; and the Delian god and Artemis are due to the art of Tectaeus and 
Angelio; Hera in Samos and in Argos came from the hands of Smilis, and the other 
statues were by Phidias; Aphrodite the courtezan in Cnidus is the production of 
Praxiteles; Asclepius in Epidaurus is the work of Phidias. In a word, of not one 
of these statues can it be said that it was not made by man. If, then, these are 
gods, why did they not exist from the beginning? Why, in sooth, are they younger 
than those who made them? Why, in sooth, in order to their coming into 
existence, did they need the aid of men and art? They are nothing but earth, and 
stones, and matter, and curious art. 
CHAP. XVIII.--THE GODS THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN CREATED, AS THE POETS CONFESS. 
But, since it is affirmed by some that, although these are only images, yet 
there exist gods in honour of whom they are made; and that the supplications and 
sacrifices presented to the images are to be referred to the gods, and are in 
fact made to the gods; and that there is not any other way of coming to them, 
for "'Tis hard for man To meet in presence visible a God;" and whereas, in proof 
that such is the fact, they adduce the eneregies possessed by certain images, 
let us examine into the power attached to their names. And I would beseech you, 
greatest of emperors, before I enter on this discussion, to be indulgent to me 
while I bring forward true considerations; for it is not my design to show the 
fallacy of idols, but, by disproving the calumnies vented against us, to offer a 
reason for the course of life we follow. May you, by considering yourselves, be 
able to discover the heavenly kingdom also! For as all things are subservient to 
you, father and son, who have received the kingdom from above (for "the king's 
soul is in the hand of God," saith the prophetic Spirit), so to the one God and 
the Logos proceeding from. Him, the Son, apprehended by us as inseparable from 
Him, all things are in like manner subjected. This then especially I beg you 
carefully to consider. The gods, as they affirm, were not from the beginning, 
but every one of them has come into existence just like ourselves. And in this 
opinion they all agree. Homer speaks of "Old Oceanus, The sire of gods, and 
Tethys;" and Orpheus (who, moreover, was the first to invent their names, and 
recounted their births, and narrated the exploits of each, and is believed by 
them to treat with greater truth than others of divine things, whom Homer 
himself follows in most matters, especially in reference to the gods)--he, too, 
has fixed their first origin to be from water:- "Oceanus, the origin of all." 
For, according to him, water was the beginning of all things, and from water 
mud was formed, and from both was produced an animal, a dragon with the head of 
a lion growing to it, and between the two heads there was the face of a god, 
named Heracles and Kronos. This Heracles generated an egg of enormous size, 
which, on becoming full, was, by the powerful friction of its generator, burst 
into two, the part at the top receiving the form of heaven (ouranos), and 
the lower part that of earth (gh). The goddess Ge, moreover, came forth 
with a body; and Ouranos, by his union with Ge, begat females, Clotho, Lachesis, 
and Atropos; and males, the hundred-handed Cottys, Gyges, Briareus, and the 
Cyclopes Brontes, and Steropes, and Argos, whom also he bound and hurled down to 
Tartarus, having learnt that he was to be ejected from his government by his 
children; whereupon Ge, being enraged, brought forth the Titans. 
"The godlike Gala bore to Ouranos Sons who are by the name of Titans known, 
Because they vengeance took on Ouranos, Majestic, glitt'ring with his starry 
crown." 
CHAP. XIX.--THE PHILOSOPHERS AGREE WITH THE POETS RESPECTING THE GODS. 
Such was the beginning of the existence both of their gods and of the 
universe. Now what are we to make of this? For each of those things to which 
divinity is ascribed is conceived of as having existed from the first. For, if 
they have come into being, having previously had no existence, as those say who 
treat of the gods, they do not exist. For, a thing is either uncreated and 
eternal, or created and perishable. Nor do I think one thing and the 
philosophers another. "What is that which always is, and has no origin; or what 
is that which has been originated, yet never is?" Discoursing of the 
intelligible and the sensible, Plato teaches that that which always is, the 
intelligible, is unoriginated, but that which is not, the sensible, is 
originated, beginning to be and ceasing to exist. In like manner, the Stoics 
also say that all things will be burnt up and will again exist, the world 
receiving another beginning. But if, although there is, according to them, a 
twofold cause, one active and governing, namely providence, the other passive 
and changeable, namely matter, it is nevertheless impossible for the world, even 
though under the care of Providence, to remain in the same state, because it is 
created--how can the constitution of these gods remain, who are not 
self-existent, but have been originated? And in what are the gods superior to 
matter, since they derive their constitution from water? But not even water, 
according to them, is the beginning of all things. From simple and homogeneous 
elements what could be constituted? Moreover, matter requires an artificer, and 
the artificer requires matter. For how could figures be made without matter or 
an artificer? Neither, again, is it reasonable that matter should be older than 
God; for the efficient cause must of necessity exist before the things that are 
made. 
CHAP. XX.--ABSURD REPRESENTATIONS OF THE GODS. 
If the absurdity of their theology were confined to saying that the gods were 
created, and owed their constitution to water, since I have demonstrated that 
nothing is made which is not also liable to dissolution, I might proceed to the 
remaining charges. But, on the one hand, they have described their bodily forms: 
speaking of Hercules, for instance, as a god in the shape of a dragon coiled up; 
of others as hundred-handed; of the daughter of Zeus, whom he begat of his 
mother Rhea; or of Demeter, as having two eyes in the natural order, and two in 
her forehead, and the face of an animal on the back part of her neck, and as 
having also horns, so that Rhea, frightened at her monster of a child, fled from 
her, and did not give her the breast (qhlh), whence mystically she is 
called Athela, but commonly Phersephone and Kore, though she is not the same as 
Athena, who is called Kore from the pupil of the eye;--and, on the other hand, 
they have described their admirable achievements, as they deem them: how Kronos, 
for instance, mutilated his father, and hurled him down from his chariot, and 
how he murdered his children, and swallowed the males of them; and how Zeus 
bound his father, and cast him down to Tartarus, as did Ouranos also to his 
sons, and fought with the Titans for the government; and how he persecuted his 
mother Rhea when she refused to wed him, and, she becoming a she-dragon, and he 
himself being changed into a dragon, bound her with what is called the Herculean 
knot, and accomplished his purpose, of which fact the rod of Hermes is a symbol; 
and again, how he violated his daughter Phersephone, in this case also assuming 
the form of a dragon, and became the father of Dionysus. In face of narrations 
like these, I must say at least this much, What that is becoming or useful is 
there in such a history, that we must believe Kronos, Zeus, Kore, and the rest, 
to be gods? Is it the descriptions of their bodies? Why, what man of judgment 
and reflection will believe that a viper was begotten by a god (thus Orpheus:- 
"But from the sacred womb Phanes begat Another offspring, horrible and fierce, 
In sight a frightful viper, on whose head Were hairs: its face was comely; but 
the rest, From the neck downwards, bore the aspect dire Of a dread dragon" ); or 
who will admit that Phanes himself, being a first-born god (for he it was that 
was produced from the egg), has the body or shape of a dragon, or was swallowed 
by Zeus, that Zeus might be too large to be contained? For if they differ in no 
respect from the lowest brutes (since it is evident that the Deity must differ 
from the things of earth and those that are derived from matter), they are not 
gods. How, then, I ask, can we approach them as suppliants, when their origin 
resembles that of cattle, and they themselves have the form of brutes, and are 
ugly to behold? 
CHAP. XXI.--IMPURE LOVES ASCRIBED TO THE GODS. 
But should it be said that they only had fleshly forms, and possess blood and 
seed, and the affections of anger and sexual desire, even then we must regard 
such assertions as nonsensical and ridiculous; for there is neither anger, nor 
desire and appetite, nor procreative seed, in gods. Let them, then, have fleshly 
forms, but let them be superior to wrath and anger, that Athena may not be seen 
"Burning with rage and inly wroth with Jove;" nor Hera appear thus:- "Juno's 
breast Could not contain her rage." 
And let them be superior to grief:- 
"A woful sight mine eyes behold: a man I love in flight around the walls! My 
heart For Hector grieves." 
For I call even men rude and stupid who give way to anger and grief. But when 
the "father of men and gods" mourns for his son,- "Woe, woe! that fate decrees 
my best belov'd Sarpedon, by Patroclus' hand to fall;" and is not able while he 
mourns to rescue him from his peril:- "The son of Jove, yet Jove preserv'd him 
not;" who would not blame the folly of those who, with tales like these, are 
lovers of the gods, or rather, live without any god? Let them have fleshly 
forms, but let not Aphrodite be wounded by Diomedes in her body: - "The haughty 
son of Tydeus, Diomed, Hath wounded me;" or by Ares in her soul:- "Me, awkward 
me, she scorns; and yields her charms To that fair lecher, the strong god of 
arms." 
"The weapon pierced the flesh." 
He who was terrible in battle, the ally of Zeus against the Titans, is shown 
to be weaker than Diomedes:- "He raged, as Mars, when brandishing his spear." 
Hush! Homer, a god never rages. But you describe the god to me as 
blood-stained, and the bane of mortals:- "Mars, Mars, the bane of mortals, 
stained with blood;" and you tell of his adultery and his bonds:- "Then, nothing 
loth, th' enamour'd fair he led, And sunk transported on the conscious bed. 
Down rushed the toils." 
Do they not pour forth impious stuff of this sort in abundance concerning the 
gods? Ouranos is mutilated; Kronos is bound, and thrust down to Tartarus; the 
Titans revolt; Styx dies in battle: yea, they even represent them as mortal; 
they are in love with one another; they are in love with human beings:- "AEneas, 
amid Ida's jutting peaks, Immortal Venus to Anchises bore." 
Are they not in love? Do they not suffer? Nay, verily, they are gods, and 
desire cannot touch them! Even though a god assume flesh in pursuance of a 
divine purpose," he is therefore the slave of desire. 
"For never yet did such a flood of love, For goddess or for mortal, fill my 
soul; Not for Ixion's beauteous wife, who bore Pirithous, sage in council as the 
gods; Nor the neat-footed maiden Danae, A crisius' daughter, her who Perseus 
bore, Th' observ'd of all; nor noble Phoenix child; . . . . . . nor for Semele; 
Nor for Alcmena fair; . . . 
No, nor for Ceres, golden-tressed queen; Nor for Latona bright; nor for 
thyself." 
He is created, he is perishable, with no trace of a god in him. Nay, they are 
even the hired servants of men:- "Admetus' halls, in which I have endured To 
praise the menial table, though a god." 
And they tend cattle:- "And coming to this laud, I cattle fed, For him that 
was my host, and kept this house." 
Admetus, therefore, was superior to the god. 0 prophet and wise one, and who 
canst foresee for others the things that shall be, thou didst not divine the 
slaughter of thy beloved, but didst even kill him with thine own hand, dear as 
he was:- "And I believed Apollo's mouth divine Was full of truth, as well as 
prophet's art. 
(AEschylus is reproaching Apollo for being a false prophet:)- "The very one 
who slugs while at the feast, The one who said these things, alas! is he Who 
slew my son." 
CHAP. XXII.--PRETENDED SYMBOLICAL EXPLANATIONS. 
But perhaps these things are poetic vagary, and there is some natural 
explanation of them, such as this by Empedocles:- "Let Jove be fire, and Juno 
source of life, With Pluto and Nestis, who bathes with tears The human founts." 
If, then, Zeus is fire, and Hera the earth, and Aidoneus the air, and Nestis 
water, and these are elements--fire, water, air--none of them is a god, neither 
Zeus, nor Hera, nor Aidoneus; for from matter separated into parts by God is 
their constitution and origin:- "Fire, water, earth, and the air's gentle 
height, And harmony with these." 
Here are things which without harmony cannot abide; which would be brought to 
ruin by strife: how then can any one say that they are gods? Friendship, 
according to Empedocles, has an aptitude to govern, things that are compounded 
are governed, and that which is apt to govern has the dominion; so that if we 
make the power of the governed and the governing one and the same, we shall be, 
unawares to ourselves putting perishable and fluctuating and changeable matter 
on an equality with the uncreated, and eternal, and ever self-accordant God. 
Zeus is, according to the Stoics, the fervid part of nature; Hera is the air 
(ahr)--the very name, if it be joined to itself, signifying this; 
Poseidon is what is drunk (water, posis). But these things are by 
different persons explained of natural objects in different ways. Some call Zeus 
twofold masculine-feminine air; others the season which brings about mild 
weather, on which account it was that he alone escaped from Kronos. But to the 
Stoics it may be said, If you acknowledge one God, the supreme and uncreated and 
eternal One, and as many compound bodies as there are changes of matter, and say 
that the Spirit of God, which pervades matter, obtains according to its 
variations a diversity of names the forms of matter will become the body of God; 
but when the elements are destroyed in the conflagration, the names will 
necessarily perish along with the forms, the Spirit of God alone remaining. Who, 
then, can believe that those bodies, of which the variation according to matter 
is allied to corruption, are gods? But to those who say that Kronos is time, and 
Rhea the earth, and that she becomes pregnant by Kronos, and brings forth, 
whence she is regarded as the mother of all; and that he begets and devours his 
offspring; and that the mutilation is the intercourse of the male with the 
female, which cuts off the seed and casts it into the womb, and generates a 
human being, who has in himself the sexual desire, which is Aphrodite; and that 
the madness of Kronos is the turn of season, which destroys animate and 
inanimate things; and that the bonds and Tartarus are time, which is changed by 
seasons and disappears;--to such persons we say, If Kronos is time, he changes; 
if a season, he turns about; if darkness, or frost, or the moist part of nature, 
none of these is abiding; but the Deity is immortal, and immoveable, and 
unalterable: so that neither is Kronos nor his image God. As regards Zeus again: 
If he is air, born of Kronos, of which the male part is called Zeus and the 
female Hera (whence both sister and wife), he is subject to change; if a season, 
he turns about: but the Deity neither changes nor shifts about. But why should I 
trespass on your patience by saying more, when you know so well what has been 
said by each of those who have resolved these things into nature, or what 
various writers have thought concerning nature, or what they say concerning 
Athena, whom they affirm to be the wisdom (fronhsis) pervading all 
things; and concerning Isis, whom they call the birth of all time (fusis
aiwnos), from whom all have sprung, and by whom all exist; or concerning 
Osiris, on whose murder by Typhon his brother Isis with her son Orus sought 
after his limbs, and finding them honoured them with a sepulchre, which 
sepulchre is to this day called the tomb of Osiris? For whilst they wander up 
and down about the forms of matter, they miss to find the God who can only be 
beheld by the reason, while they deify the elements and their several parts, 
applying different names to them at different times: calling the sowing of the 
corn, for instance, Osiris (hence they say, that in the mysteries, on the 
finding of the members of his body, or the fruits, Isis is thus addressed: We 
have found, we wish thee joy), the fruit of the vine Dionysus, the vine itself 
Semele, the heat of the sun the thunderbolt. And yet, in fact, they who refer 
the fables to actual gods, do anything rather than add to their divine 
character; for they do not perceive, that by the very defence they make for the 
gods, they confirm the things which are alleged concerning them. What have 
Europa, and the bull, and the swan, and Leda, to do with the earth and air, that 
the abominable intercourse of Zeus with them should be taken for the intercourse 
of the earth and air? But missing to discover the greatness of God, and not 
being able to rise on high with their reason (for they have no affinity for the 
heavenly place), they pine away among the forms of matter, and rooted to the 
earth, deify the changes of the elements: just as if any one should put the ship 
he sailed in the place of the steersman. But as the ship, although equipped with 
everything, is of no use if it have not a steersman, so neither are the 
elements, though arranged in perfect order, of any service apart from the 
providence of God. For the ship will not sail of itself; and the elements 
without their Framer will not move. 
CHAP. XXIII.--OPINIONS OF THALES AND PLATO. 
You may say, however, since you excel all men in understanding, How comes it 
to pass, then, that some of the idols manifest power, if those to whom we erect 
the statues are not gods? For it is not likely that images destitute of life and 
motion can of themselves do anything without a mover. That in various places, 
cities, and nations, certain effects are brought about in the name of idols, we 
are far from denying. None the more, however, if some have received benefit, and 
others, on the contrary, suffered harm, shall we deem those to be gods who have 
produced the effects in either case. But I have made careful inquiry, both why 
it is that you think the idols to have this power, and who they are that, 
usurping their names, produce the effects. It is necessary for me, however, in 
attempting to show who they are that produce the effects ascribed to the idols, 
and that they are not gods, to have recourse to some witnesses from among the 
philosophers. First Thales, as those Who have accurately examined his opinions 
report, divides [superior beings] into God, demons, and heroes. God he 
recognises as the Intelligence (nous) of the world; by demons he 
understands beings possessed of Soul (yukikai); and by heroes the 
separated souls of men, the good being the good souls, and the bad the 
worthless. Plato again, while withholding his assent on other points, also 
divides [superior beings] into the uncreated God and those produced by' the 
uncreated One for the adornment of heaven, the planets, and the fixed stars, and 
into demons; concerning which demons, while he does not think fit to speak 
himself, he thinks that those ought to be listened to who have spoken about 
them. "To speak concerning the other demons, and to know their origin, is beyond 
our powers; but we ought to believe those who have before spoken, the 
descendants of gods, as they say--and surely they must be well acquainted with 
their own ancestors: it is impossible, therefore, to disbelieve the sons of 
gods, even though they speak without probable or convincing proofs; but as they 
profess to tell of their own family affairs, we are bound, in pursuance of 
custom, to believe them. In this way, then, let us hold and speak as they do 
concerning the origin of the gods themselves. Of Ge and Ouranos were born 
Oceanus and Tethys; and of these Phorcus, Kronos, and Rhea, and the rest; and of 
Kronos and Rhea, Zeus, Hera, and all the others, who, we know, are all called 
their brothers; besides other descendants again of these." Did, then, he who had 
contemplated the eternal Intelligence and God who is apprehended by reason, and 
declared His attributes--His real existence, the simplicity of His nature, the 
good that flows forth from Him that is truth, and discoursed of primal power, 
and how "all things are about the King of all, and all things exist for His 
sake, and He is the cause of all;" and about two and three, that He is "the 
second moving about the seconds, and the third about the thirds;" --did this man 
think, that to learn the truth concerning those who are said to have been 
produced from sensible things, namely earth and heaven, was a task transcending 
his powers? It is not to be believed for a moment. But because he thought it 
impossible to believe that gods beget and are brought forth, since everything 
that begins to be is followed by an end, and (for this is much more difficult) 
to change the views of the multitude, who receive the fables without 
examination, on this account it was that he declared it to be beyond his powers 
to know and to speak concerning the origin of the other demons, since he was 
unable either to admit or teach that gods were begotten. And as regards that 
saying of his, "The great sovereign in heaven, Zeus, driving a winged car, 
advances first, ordering and managing all things, and there follow him a host of 
gods and demons," this does not refer to the Zeus who is said to have sprung 
from Kronos; for here the name is given to the Maker of the universe. This is 
shown by Plato himself: not being able to designate Him by another title that 
should be suitable, he availed himself of the popular name, not as peculiar to 
God, but for distinctness, because it is not possible to discourse of God to all 
men as fully as one might; and he adds at the same time the epithet "Great," so 
as to distinguish the heavenly from the earthly, the uncreated from the created, 
who is younger than heaven and earth, and younger than the Cretans, who stole 
him away, that he might not be killed by his father. 
CHAP. XXIV.--CONCERNING THE ANGELS AND GIANTS. 
What need is there, in speaking to you who have searched into every 
department of knowledge, to mention the poets, or to examine opinions of another 
kind? Let it suffice to say thus much. If the poets and philosophers did not 
acknowledge that there is one God, and concerning these gods were not of 
opinion, some that they are demons, others that they are matter, and others that 
they once were men,there might be some show of reason for our being harassed as 
we are, since we employ language which makes a distinction between God and 
matter, and the natures of the two. For, as we acknowledge a God, and a Son his 
Logos, and a Holy Spirit, united in essence,the Father, the Son, the Spirit, 
because the Son is the Intelligence, Reason, Wisdom of the Father, and the 
Spirit an effluence, as light from fire; so also do we apprehend the existence 
of other powers, which exercise dominion about matter, and by means of it, and 
one in particular, which is hostile to God: not that anything is really opposed 
to God, like strife to friendship, according to Empedocles, and night to day, 
according to the appearing and disappearing of the stars (for even if anything 
had placed itself in opposition to God, it would have ceased to exist, its 
structure being destroyed by-the power and might of God), but that to the good 
that is in God, which belongs of necessity to Him, and co-exists with Him, as 
colour with body, without which it has no existence (not as being part of it, 
but as an attendant property co-existing with it, united and blended, just as it 
is natural for fire to be yellow and the ether dark blue),--to the good that is 
in God, I say, the spirit which is about matter, who was created by God; just as 
the other angels were created by Him, and entrusted with the control of matter 
and the forms of matter, is opposed. For this is the office of the angels,--to 
exercise providence for God over the things created and ordered by Him; so that 
God may have the universal and general providence of the whole, while the 
particular parts are provided for by the angels appointed over them. Just as 
with men, who have freedom of choice as to both virtue and vice (for you would 
not either honour the good or punish the bad, unless vice and virtue were in 
their own power; and some are diligent in the matters entrusted to them by you, 
and others faithless), so is it among the angels. Some, free agents, you will 
observe, such as they were created by God, continued in those things for which 
God had made and over which He had ordained them; but some outraged both the 
constitution of their nature and the government entrusted to them: namely, this 
ruler of matter and its various forms, and others of those who were placed about 
this first firmament (you know that we say nothing without witnesses, but state 
the things which have been declared by the prophets); these fell into impure 
love of virgins, and were subjugated by the flesh, and he became negligent and 
wicked in the management of the things entrusted to him. Of these lovers of 
virgins, therefore, were begotten those who are called giants. And if something 
has been said by the poets, too, about the giants, be not surprised at this: 
worldly Wisdom and divine differ as much from each other as truth and 
plausibility: the one is of heaven and the other of earth; and indeed, according 
to the prince of matter,- "We know we oft speak lies that look like troths." 
CHAP. XXV.--THE POETS AND PHILOSOPHERS HAVE DENIED A DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 
These angels, then, who have fallen from heaven, and haunt the air and the 
earth, and are no longer able to rise to heavenly things, and the souls of the 
giants, which are the demons who wander about the world, perform actions 
similar, the one (that is, the demons) to the natures they have received, the 
other (that is, the angels) to the appetites they have indulged. But the prince 
of matter, as may be seen merely from what transpires, exercises a control and 
management contrary to the good that is in God:- "Ofttimes this anxious thought 
has crossed my mind, Whether 'tis chance or deity that rules The small affairs 
of men; and, spite of hope As well as justice, drives to exile some Stripped of 
all means of life, while others still Continue to enjoy prosperity." 
Prosperity and adversity, contrary to hope and justice, made it impossible 
for Euripides to say to whom belongs the administration of earthly affairs, 
which is of such a kind that one might say of it:- "How then, while seeing these 
things, can we say There is a race of gods, or yield to laws?" 
The same thing led Aristotle to say that the things below the heaven are not 
under the care of Providence, although the eternal providence of God concerns 
itself equally with us below, "The earth, let willingness move her or not, Must 
herbs produce, and thus sustain my flocks," - and addresses itself to the 
deserving individually, according to truth and not according to opinion; and all 
other things, according to the general constitution of nature, are provided for 
by the law of reason. But because the demoniac movements and operations 
proceeding from the adverse spirit produce these disorderly sallies, and 
moreover move men, some in one way and some in another, as individuals and as 
nations, separately and in common, in accordance with the tendency of matter on 
the one hand, and of the affinity for divine things on the other, from within 
and from without,--some who are of no mean reputation have therefore thought 
that this universe is constituted without any definite order, and is driven 
hither and thither by an irrational chance. But they do not understand, that of 
those things which belong to the constitution of the whole world there is 
nothing out of order or neglected, but that each one of them has been produced 
by reason, and that, therefore, they do not transgress the order prescribed to 
them; and that man himself, too, so far as He that made him is concerned, is 
well ordered, both by his original nature, which has one common character for 
all, and by the constitution of his body, which does not transgress the law 
imposed upon it, and by the termination of his life, which remains equal and 
common to all alike; but that, according to the character peculiar to himself 
and the operation of the ruling prince and of the demons his followers, he is 
impelled and moved in this direction or in that, notwithstanding that all 
possess in common the same original constitution of mind. 
CHAP. XXVI.--THE DEMONS ALLURE MEN TO THE WORSHIP OF IMAGES, 
They who draw men to idols, then, are the aforesaid demons, who are eager for 
the blood of the sacrifices, and lick them; but the gods that please the 
multitude, and whose names are given to the images, were men, as may be learned 
from their history. And that it is the demons who act under their names, is 
proved by the nature of their operations. For some castrate, as Rhea; others 
wound and slaughter, as Artemis; the Tauric goddess puts all strangers to death. 
I pass over those who lacerate with knives and scourges of bones, and shall not 
attempt to describe all the kinds of demons; for it is not the part of a god to 
incite to things against nature. 
"But when the demon plots against a man, He first inflicts some hurt upon his 
mind." 
But God, being perfectly good, is eternally doing good. That, moreover, those 
who exert the power are not the same as those to whom the statues are erected, 
very strong evidence is afforded by Troas and Parium. The one has statues of 
Neryllinus, a man of our own times; and Parium of Alexander and Proteus: both 
the sepulchre and the statue of Alexander are still in the forum. The other 
statues of Neryllinus, then, are a public ornament, if indeed a city can be 
adorned by such objects as these; but one of them is supposed to utter oracles 
and to heal the sick, and on this account the people of the Troad offer 
sacrifices to this statue, and overlay it with gold, and hang chaplets upon it. 
But of the statues of Alexander and Proteus (the latter, you are aware, threw 
himself into the fire near Olympia), that of Proteus is likewise said to utter 
oracles; and to that of Alexander- "Wretched Paris, though in form so fair, Thou 
slave of woman" - sacrifices are offered and festivals are held at the public 
cost, as to a god who can hear. Is it, then, Neryllinus, and Proteus, and 
Alexander who exert these energies in connection with the statues, or is it the 
nature of the matter itself? But the matter is brass. And what can brass do of 
itself, which may be made again into a different form, as Amasis treated the 
footpan, as told by Herodotus? And Neryllinus, and Proteus, and Alexander, what 
good are they to the sick? For what the image is said now to effect, it effected 
when Neryllinus was alive and sick. 
CHAP. XXVII.--ARTIFICES OF THE DEMONS. 
What then? In the first place, the irrational and fantastic movements of the 
soul about opinions produce a diversity of images (eidwla) from time to 
time: some they derive from matter, and some they fashion and bring forth for 
themselves; and this happens to a soul especially when it par takes of the 
material spirit and becomes mingled with it, looking not at heavenly things and 
their Maker, but downwards to earthly things, wholly at the earth, as being now 
mere flesh and blood, and no longer pure spirit. These irrational and fantastic 
movements of the soul, then, give birth to empty visions in the mind, by which 
it becomes madly set on idols. When, too, a tender and susceptible soul, which 
has no knowledge or experience of sounder doctrines, and is unaccustomed to 
contemplate truth, and to consider thoughtfully the Father and Maker of all 
things, gets impressed with false opinions respecting itself, then the demons 
who hover about matter, greedy of sacrificial odours and the blood of victims, 
and ever ready to lead men into error, avail themselves of these delusive 
movements of the souls of the multitude; and, taking possession of their 
thoughts, cause to flow into the mind empty visions as if coming from the idols 
and the statues; and when, too, a soul of itself, as being immortal, moves 
comformably to reason, either predicting the future or healing the present, the 
demons claim the glory for themselves. 
CHAP. XXVIII.--THE HEATHEN GODS WERE SIMPLY MEN. 
But it is perhaps necessary, in accordance with what has already been 
adduced, to say a little about their names. Herodotus, then, and Alexander the 
son of Philip, in his letter to his mother (and each of them is said to have 
conversed with the priests at Heliopolis, and Memphis, and Thebes), affirm that 
they learnt from them that the gods had been men. Herodotus speaks thus: "Of 
such a nature were, they said, the beings represented by these images, they were 
very far indeed from being gods. However, in the times anterior to them it was 
otherwise; then 
Egypt had gods for its rulers, who dwelt upon the earth with men, one being 
always supreme above the rest. The last of these was Horus the son of Osiris, 
called by the Greeks Apollo. He deposed Typhon, and ruled over Egypt as its last 
god-king. Osiris is named Dionysus (Bacchus) by the Greeks." "Almost all the 
names of the gods came into Greece from Egypt." Apollo was the son of Dionysus 
and Isis, as He rodotus likewise affirms: "According to the Egyptians, Apollo 
and Diana are the children of Bacchus and Isis; while Latona is their nurse and 
their preserver." These beings of heavenly origin they had for their first 
kings: partly from ignorance of the true worship of the Deity, partly from 
gratitude for their government, they esteemed them as gods together with their 
wives. "The male kine, if clean, and the male calves are used for sacrifice by 
the Egyptians universally; but the females, they are not allowed to sacrifice, 
since they are sacred to Isis. The statue of this goddess has the form of a 
woman but with horns like a cow, resembling those of the Greek representations 
of Io." And who can be more deserving of credit in making these statements, than 
those who in family succession son from father, received not only the 
priesthood, but also the history? For it is not likely that the priests, who 
make if their business to commend the idols to men's reverence, would assert 
falsely that they were men. If Herodotus alone had said that the Egyptians spoke 
in their histories of the gods as of men, when he says, "What they told me 
concerning their religion it is not my intention to repeat, except only the 
names of their deities, things of very trifling importance," it would behove us 
not to credit even Herodotus as being a fabulist. But as Alexander and Hermes 
surnamed Trismegistus, who shares with them in the attribute of eternity, and 
innumerable others, not to name them individually, [declare the same], no room 
is left even for doubt that they, being kings, were esteemed gods. That they 
were men, the most learned of the Egyptians also testify, who, while saying that 
ether, earth, sun, moon, are gods, regard the rest as mortal men, and the 
temples as their sepulchres. 
Apollodorus, too, asserts the same thing in his treatise concerning the gods. 

But Herodotus calls even their sufferings mysteries. "The ceremonies at the 
feast of Isis in the city of Busiris have been already spoken of. It is there 
that the whole multitude, both of men and women, many thousands in number, beat 
them selves at the close of the sacrifice in honour of a god whose name a 
religious scruple forbids me to mention." If they are gods, they are also 
immortal; but if people are beaten for them, and their sufferings are mysteries, 
they are men, as Herodotus himself says: "Here, too, in this same precinct of 
Minerva at Sais, is the burial-place of one whom I think it not right to mention 
in such a connection. It stands behind the temple against the back wall, which 
it entirely covers. There are also some large stone obelisks in the enclosure, 
and there is a lake near them, adorned with an edging of stone. In form it is 
circular, and in size, as it seemed to me, about equal to the lake at Delos 
called the Hoop. On this lake it is that the Egyptians represent by night his 
sufferings whose name I refrain from mentioning, and this representation they 
call their mysteries." And not only is the sepulchre of Osiris shown, but also 
his embalming: "When a body is brought to them, they show the bearer various 
models of corpses made in wood, and painted so as to resemble nature. The most 
perfect is said to be after the manner of him whom I do not think it religious 
to name in connection with such a matter." 
CHAP. XXIX.--PROOF OF THE SAME FROM THE POETS. 
But among the Greeks, also, those who are eminent in poetry and history say 
the same thing. Thus of Heracles:- "That lawless wretch, that man of brutal 
strength, Deaf to Heaven's voice, the social rite transgressed." 
Such being his nature, deservedly did he go mad, and deservedly did he light 
the funeral pile and burn himself to death. Of Asklepius, Hesiod says:- "The 
mighty father both of gods and men Was filled with wrath, and from Olympus' top 
With flaming thunderbolt cast down and slew Latona's well-lov'd son--such was 
his ire." 
And Pindar:- "But even wisdom is ensnared by gain. 
The brilliant bribe of gold seen in the hand Ev'n him perverted: therefore 
Kronos' son With both hands quickly stopp'd his vital breath, And by a bolt of 
fire ensured his doom.' 
Either, therefore, they were gods and did not hanker after gold- "O gold, the 
fairest prize to mortal men, Which neither mother equals in delight, Nor 
children dear" - for the Deity is in want of nought, and is superior to carnal 
desire, nor did they die; or, having been born men, they were wicked by reason 
of ignorance, and overcome by love of money. What more need I say, or refer to 
Castor, or Pollux, or Amphiaraus, who, having been born, so to speak, only the 
other day, men of men, are looked upon as gods, when they imagine even Ino after 
her madness and its consequent sufferings to have become a goddess? 
"Sea-rovers will her name Leucothea." 
And her son:- "August Palaemon, sailors will invoke." 
CHAP. XXX.--REASONS WHY DIVINITY HAS BEEN ASCRIBED TO MEN. 
For if detestable and god-hated men had the reputation of being gods, and the 
daughter of Derceto, Semiramis, a lascivious and blood-stained woman, was 
esteemed a Syria goddess; and if, on account of Derceto, the Syrians worship 
doves and Semiramis (for, a thing impossible, a woman was changed into a dove: 
the story is in Ctesias), what wonder if some should be called gods by their 
people on the ground of their rule and sovereignty (the Sibyl, of whom Plato 
also makes mention, says:- "It was the generation then the tenth, Of men endow'd 
with speech, since forth the flood Had burst upon the men of former times, And 
Kronos, Japetus, and Titan reigned, Whom men, of Ouranos and Gaia Proclaimed the 
noblest sons, and named them so, 
Because of men endowed with gift of speech They were the first"); and others 
for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus; and others for their art, as 
Asclepius? Those, therefore, to whom either the subjects gave honour or the 
rulers themselves [assumed it], obtained the name, some from fear, others from 
revenge. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors towards their 
subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after adopted the 
worship without examination. 
"The Cretans always lie; for they, O king, Have built a tomb to thee who art 
not dead." 
Though you believe, O Callimachus, in the nativity of Zeus, you do not 
believe in his sepulchre; and whilst you think to obscure the truth, you in fact 
proclaim him dead, even to those who are ignorant; and if you see the cave, you 
call to mind the childbirth of Rhea; but when you see the coffin, you throw a 
shadow over his death, not considering that the unbegotten God alone is eternal. 
For either the tales told by the multitude and the poets about the gods are 
unworthy of credit, and the reverence shown them is superfluous (for those do 
not exist, the tales concerning whom are untrue); or if the births, the amours, 
the murders, the thefts, the castrations, the thunderbolts, are true, they no 
longer exist, having ceased to be since they were born, having previously had no 
being. And on what principle must we believe some things and disbelieve others, 
when the poets have written their stories in order to gain greater veneration 
for them? For surely those through whom they have got to be considered gods, and 
who have striven to represent their deeds as worthy of reverence, cannot have 
invented their sufferings. That, therefore, we are not atheists, acknowledging 
as we do God the Maker of this universe and His Logos, has been proved according 
to my ability, if not according to the importance of the subject. 
CHAP. XXXI.--CONFUTATION OF THE OTHER CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST THE CHRISTIANS. 

But they have further also made up stories against us of impious feasts and 
forbidden intercourse between the sexes, both that they may appear to themselves 
to have rational grounds of hatred, and because they think either by fear to 
lead us away from our way of life, or to render the rulers harsh and inexorable 
by the magnitude of the charges they bring. But they lose their labour with 
those who know that from of old it has been the custom, and not in our time 
only, for vice to make war on virtue. Thus Pythagoras, with three hundred 
others, was burnt to death; Heraclitus and Democritus were banished, the one 
from the city of the Ephesians, the other from Abdera, because he was charged 
with being mad; and the Athenians condemned Socrates to death. But as they were 
none the worse in respect of virtue because of the opinion of the multitude, so 
neither does the undiscriminating calumny of some persons cast any shade upon us 
as regards rectitude of life, for with God we stand in good repute. 
Nevertheless, I will meet these charges also, although I am well assured that by 
what has been already said I have cleared myself to you. For as you excel all 
men in intelligence, you know that those whose life is directed towards God as 
its rule, so that each one among us may be blameless and irreproachable before 
Him, will not entertain even the thought of the slightest sin. For if we 
believed that we should live only the present life, then we might be suspected 
of sinning, through being enslaved to flesh and blood, or overmastered by gain 
or carnal desire; but since we know that God is witness to what we think and 
what we say both by night and by day, and that He, being Himself light, sees all 
things in our heart, we are persuaded that when we are removed from the present 
life we shall live another life, better than the present one, and heavenly, not 
earthly (since we shall abide near God, and with God, free from all change or 
suffering in the soul, not as flesh, even though we shall have flesh, but as 
heavenly spirit), or, falling with the rest, a worse one and in fire; for God 
has not made us as sheep or beasts of burden, a mere by-work, and that we should 
perish and be annihilated. On these grounds it is not likely that we should wish 
to do evil, or deliver ourselves over to the great Judge to be punished. 
CHAP. XXXII.--ELEVATED MORALITY OF THE CHRISTIANS. 
It is, however, nothing wonderful that they should get up tales about us such 
as they tell of their own gods, of the incidents of whose lives they make 
mysteries. But it behoved them, if they meant to condemn shameless and 
promiscuous intercourse, to hate either Zeus, who begat children of his mother 
Rhea and his daughter Kore, and took his own sister to wife, or Orpheus, the 
inventor of these tales, which made Zeus more unholy and detestable than 
Thyestes himself; for the latter defiled his daughter in pursuance of an oracle, 
and when he wanted to obtain the kingdom and avenge himself. But we are so far 
from practising promiscuous intercourse, that it is not lawful among us to 
indulge even a lustful look. "For," saith He, "he that looketh on a woman to 
lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart." Those, then, who 
are forbidden to look at anything more than that for which God formed the eyes, 
which were intended to be a light to us, and to whom a wanton look is adultery, 
the eyes being made for other purposes, and who are to be called to account for 
their very thoughts, how can any one doubt that such persons practise 
self-control? For our account lies not with human laws, which a bad man can 
evade (at the outset I proved to you, sovereign lords, that our doctrine is from 
the teaching of God), but we have a law which makes the measure of rectitude to 
consist in dealing with our neighbour as ourselves. On this account, too, 
according to age, we recognise some as sons and daughters, others we regard as 
brothers and sisters, and to the more advanced in life we give the honour due to 
fathers and mothers. On behalf of those, then, to whom we apply the names of 
brothers and sisters, and other designations of relationship, we exercise the 
greatest care that their bodies should remain undefiled and uncorrupted; for the 
Logos again says to us, "If any one kiss a second time because it has given him 
pleasure, [he sins];" adding, "Therefore the kiss, or rather the salutation, 
should be given with the greatest care, since, if there be mixed with it the 
least defilement of thought, it excludes us from eternal life." 
CHAP. XXXIII.--CHASTITY OF THE CHRISTIANS WITH RESPECT TO MARRIAGE. 
Therefore, having the hope of eternal life, we despise the things of this 
life, even to the pleasures of the soul, each of us reckoning her his wife whom 
he has married according to the laws laid down by us, and that only for the 
purpose of having children. For as the husbandman throwing the seed into the 
ground awaits the harvest, not sowing more upon it, so to us the procreation of 
children is the measure of our indulgence in appetite. Nay, you would find many 
among us, both men and women, growing old unmarried, in hope of living in closer 
communion with God. But if the remaining in virginity and in the state of an 
eunuch brings nearer to God, while the indulgence of carnal thought and desire 
leads away from Him, in those cases in which we shun the thoughts, much more do 
we reject the deeds. For we bestow our attention; not on the study of words, but 
on the exhibition and teaching of actions,--that a person should either remain 
as he was born, or be content with one marriage; for a second marriage is only a 
specious adultery. "For whosoever puts away his wife," says He, "and marries 
another, commits adultery;" not permitting a man to send her away whose 
virginity he has brought to an end, nor to marry again. For he who deprives 
himself of his first wife, even though she be dead, is a cloaked adulterer, 
resisting the hand of God, because in the beginning God made one man and one 
woman, and dissolving the strictest union of flesh with flesh, formed for the 
intercourse of the race. 
CHAP. XXXIV.--THE VAST DIFFERENCE IN MORALS BETWEEN THE CHRISTIANS AND THEIR 
ACCUSERS. 
But though such is our character (Oh! why should I speak of things unfit to 
be uttered?), the things said of us are an example of the proverb, "The harlot 
reproves the chaste." For those who have set up a market for fornication and 
established infamous resorts for the young for every kind of vile pleasure,--who 
do not abstain even from males, males with males committing shocking 
abominations, outraging all the noblest and comeliest bodies in all sorts of 
ways, so dishonouring the fair workmanship of God (for beauty on earth is not 
self-made, but sent hither by the hand and will of God),--these men, I say, 
revile us for the very things which they are conscious of themselves, and 
ascribe to their own gods, boasting of them as noble deeds, and worthy of the 
gods. These adulterers and paederasts defame the eunuchs and the once-married 
(while they themselves live like fishes; for these gulp down whatever fails in 
their way, and the stronger chases the weaker: and, in fact, this is to feed 
upon human flesh, to do violence in contravention of the very laws which you and 
your ancestors, with due care for all that is fair and right, have enacted), so 
that not even the governors of the provinces sent by you suffice for the hearing 
of the complaints against those, to whom it even is not lawful, when they are 
struck, not to offer themselves for more blows, nor when defamed not to bless: 
for it is not enough to be just (and justice is to return like for like), but it 
is incumbent on us to be good and patient of evil. 
CHAP. XXXV.--THE CHRISTIANS CONDEMN AND DETEST ALL CRUELTY. 
What man of sound mind, therefore, will affirm, while such is our character, 
that we are murderers? For we cannot eat human flesh till we have killed some 
one. The former charge, therefore, being false, if any one should ask them in 
regard to the second, whether they have seen what they assert, not one of them 
would be so barefaced as to say that he had. And yet we have slaves, some more 
and some fewer, by whom we could not help being seen; but even of these, not one 
has been found to invent even such things against us. For when they know that we 
cannot endure even to see a man put to death, though justly; who of them can 
accuse us of murder or cannibalism? Who does not reckon among the things of 
greatest interest the contests of gladiators and wild beasts, especially those 
which are given by you? But we, deeming that to see a man put to death is much 
the same as killing him, have abjured such spectacles. How, then, when we do not 
even look on, lest we should contract guilt and pollution, can we put people to 
death? And when we say that those women who use drugs to bring on abortion 
commit murder, and will have to give an account to God s for the abortion, on 
what principle should we commit murder? For it does not belong to the same 
person to regard the very foetus in the womb as a created being, and therefore 
an object of God's care, and when it has passed into life, to kill it; and not 
to expose an infant, because those who expose them are chargeable with 
child-murder, and on the other hand, when it has been reared to destroy it. But 
we are in all things always alike and the same, submitting ourselves to reason, 
and not ruling over it. 
CHAP. XXXVI.--BEARING OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE RESURRECTION ON THE PRACTICES OF 
THE CHRISTIANS. 
Who, then, that believes in a resurrection, would make himself into a tomb 
for bodies that will rise again? For it is not the part of the same persons to 
believe that our bodies will rise again, and to eat them as if they would not; 
and to think that the earth will give back the bodies held by it, but that those 
which a man has entombed in himself will not be demanded back. On the contrary, 
it is reasonable to suppose, that those who think they shall have no account to 
give of the present life, ill or well spent, and that there is no resurrection, 
but calculate on the soul perishing with the body, and being as it were quenched 
in it, will refrain from no deed of daring; but as for those who are persuaded 
that nothing will escape the scrutiny of God, but that even the body which has 
ministered to the irrational impulses of the soul, and to its desires, will be 
punished along with it, it is not likely that they will commit even the smallest 
sin. But if to any one it appears sheer nonsense that the body which has 
mouldered away, and been dissolved, and reduced to nothing, should be 
reconstructed, we certainly cannot with any reason be accused of wickedness with 
reference to those that believe not, but only of folly; for with the opinions by 
which we deceive ourselves we injure no one else. But that it is not our belief 
alone that bodies will rise again, but that many philosophers also hold the same 
view, it is out of place to show just now, lest we should be thought to 
introduce topics irrelevant to the matter in hand, either by speaking of the 
intelligible and the sensible, and the nature of these respectively, or by 
contending that the incorporeal is older than the corporeal, and that the 
intelligible precedes the sensible, although we become acquainted with the 
latter earliest, since the corporeal is formed from the incorporeal, by the 
combination with it of the intelligible, and that the sensible is formed from 
the intelligible; for nothing hinders, according to Pythagoras and Plato, that 
when the dissolution of bodies takes place, they should, from the very same 
elements of which they were constructed at first, be constructed again. But let 
us defer the discourse concerning the resurrection. 
CHAP. XXXII.--ENTREATY TO BE FAIRLY JUDGED. 
And now do you, who are entirely in everything, by nature and by education, 
upright, and moderate, and benevolent, and worthy of your rule, now that I have 
disposed of the several accusations, and proved that we are pious, and gentle, 
and temperate in spirit, bend your royal head in approval. For who are more 
deserving to obtain the things they ask, than those who, like us, pray for your 
government, that you may, as is most equitable, receive the kingdom, son from 
father, and that your empire may receive increase and addition, all men becoming 
subject to your sway? And this is also for our advantage, that we may lead a 
peaceable and quiet life, and may ourselves readily perform all that is 
commanded us.
