Paul’s Letter to Philemon 

1:1Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and 
Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker, 1:2to the beloved 
Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house: 1:3Grace to you and peace from God our 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
1:4I thank my God always, making mention of 
you in my prayers, 1:5hearing of your love, and of the faith 
which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints; 1:6that 
the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every 
good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus. 1:7For we have much joy 
and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed 
through you, brother. 
1:8Therefore, though I have all boldness in 
Christ to command you that which is appropriate, 1:9yet for love's sake 
I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus 
Christ. 1:10I beg you for my child, whom I have 
become the father of in my chains, Onesimus, 1:11who once was useless to you, but now is 
useful to you and to me. 1:12I am sending him back. Therefore 
receive him, that is, my own heart, 1:13whom I desired to keep with me, that on 
your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Gospel. 1:14But I was willing 
to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of 
necessity, but of free will. 1:15For perhaps he was therefore separated 
from you for a while, that you would have him forever, 1:16no longer as a 
slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much 
rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 
1:17If then you count me a partner, receive 
him as you would receive me. 1:18But if he has wronged you at all, or 
owes you anything, put that to my account. 1:19I, Paul, write this 
with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even 
your own self besides). 1:20Yes, brother, let me have joy from you 
in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord. 1:21Having confidence 
in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I 
say. 
1:22Also, prepare a guest room for me, for 
I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. 
1:23Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ 
Jesus, greets you, 1:24as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and 
Luke, my fellow workers. 1:25The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be 
with your spirit. Amen.
