Theophilus of Antioch





Theophilus Bishop of 
Caesarea in Palestine.
------------
[a.d. 180.] When Eusebius says that the churches of "all Asia" concurred in 
the Ephesine use concerning the Paschal, he evidently means Asia Minor, as in 
the Scriptures and elsewhere. 
Throughout "the rest of the world," he testifies, however, that such was not the 
use. The Palestinian bishops, after the Jewish downfall, seem to have been the 
first to comprehend the propriety of adopting the more Catholic usage; and our 
author presided over a council in Caesarea, of which he was bishop, assisted by 
Narcissus, bishop of Jerusalem, with Cassius of Tyre and Clarus of Ptolemais, 
which confirmed it. It is to be noted, that Alexandria is cited by Theophilus as 
authority for this custom; and it is not quite correct to say that the 
Western usage prevailed at Nicaea, for it was the general use, save only 
in Asia Minor and churches which were colonies of the same. This fact has been 
overlooked, and is very important, in history.

From His Epistle on the Question of 
  the Passover, Written in the Name of the Synod of Caesarea. 
  
Endeavour also to send abroad copies of our epistle among all the churches, 
so that those who easily deceive their own Souls may not be able to lay the 
blame on us. We would have you know, too, that in Alexandria 
also they observe the festival on the same day as ourselves. For the 
Paschal letters are sent from us to them, and from them to us: so that we 
observe the holy day in unison and together.
