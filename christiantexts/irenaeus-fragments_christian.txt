FRAGMENTS FROM THE LOST WRITINGS OF IRENAEUS 
I. 
I ADJURE thee, who shalt transcribe this book, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and 
by His glorious appearing, when He comes to judge the living and the dead, that 
thou compare what thou hast transcribed, and be careful to set it right 
according to this copy from which thou hast transcribed; also, that thou in like 
manner copy down this adjuration, and insert it in the transcript. 
II. 
These opinions, Florinus, that I may speak in mild terms, are not of sound 
doctrine; these opinions are not consonant to the Church, and involve their 
votaries in the utmost impiety; these opinions, even the heretics beyond the 
Church's pale have never ventured to broach; these opinions, those presbyters 
who preceded us, and who were conversant with the apostles, did not hand down to 
thee. For, while I was yet a boy, I saw thee in Lower Asia with Polycarp, 
distinguishing thyself in the royal court, and endeavouring to gain his 
approbation. For I have a more vivid recollection of what occurred at that time 
than of recent events (inasmuch as the experiences of childhood, keeping pace 
with the growth of the soul, become incorporated with it); so that I can even 
describe the place where the blessed Polycarp used to sit and discourse--his 
going out, too, and his coming in--his general mode of life and personal 
appearance, together with the discourses which he delivered to the people; also 
how he would speak of his familiar intercourse with John, and with the rest of 
those who had seen the Lord; and how he would call their words to remembrance. 
Whatsoever things he had heard from them respecting the Lord, both with regard 
to His miracles and His teaching, Polycarp having thus received [information] 
from the eye-witnesses of the Word of life, would recount them all in harmony 
with the Scriptures. These things, through, God's mercy which was upon me, I 
then listened to attentively, and treasured them up not on paper, but in my 
heart; and I am continually, by God's grace, revolving these things accurately 
in my mind. And I can bear witness before God, that if that blessed and 
apostolical presbyter had heard any such thing, he would have cried out, and 
stopped his ears, exclaiming as he was wont to do: "O good God, for what times 
hast Thou reserved me, that I should endure these things?" And he would have 
fled from the very spot where, sitting or standing, he had heard such words. 
This fact, too, can be made clear, from his Epistles which he despatched, 
whether to the neighbouring Churches to confirm them, or to certain of the 
brethren, admonishing and exhorting them. 
III. 
For the controversy is not merely as regards the day, but also as regards the 
form itself of the fast. For some consider themselves hound to fast one day, 
others two days, others still more, while others [do so during] forty: the 
diurnal and the nocturnal hours they measure out together as their [fasting] 
day. And this variety among the observers [of the fasts] had not its origin in 
our time, but long before in that of our predecessors, some of whom probably, 
being not very accurate in their observance of it, handed down to posterity the 
custom as it had, through simplicity or private fancy, been [introduced among 
them]. And yet nevertheless all these lived in peace one with another, and we 
also keep peace together. Thus, in fact, the difference [in observing] the fast 
establishes the harmony of [our common] faith. And the presbyters preceding 
Sorer in the government of the Church which thou dost now rule--I mean, Anicetus 
and Pius, Hyginus and Telesphorus, and Sixtus--did neither themselves observe it 
[after that fashion], nor permit those with them to do so. Notwithstanding this, 
those who did not keep [the feast in this way] were peacefully disposed towards 
those who came to them from other dioceses in which it was observed (although 
such observance was [felt] in more decided contrariety [as presented] to those 
who did not fall in with it; and none were ever cast out [of the Church] for 
this matter. On the contrary, those presbyters who preceded thee, and who did 
not observe [this custom], sent the Eucharist to those of other dioceses who did 
observe it. And when the blessed Polycarp was sojourning in Rome in the time of 
Anicetus, although a slight controversy had arisen among them as to certain 
other points, they were at once well inclined towards each other [with regard to 
the matter in hand], not willing that any quarrel should arise between them upon 
this head. For neither could Anicetus persuade Polycarp to forego the observance 
[in his own way], inasmuch as these things had been always observed by John the 
disciple of our Lord, and by other apostles with whom he had been conversant; 
nor, on the other hand, could Polycarp succeed in persuading Anicetus to keep 
[the observance in his way], for he maintained that he was bound to adhere to 
the usage of the presbyters who preceded him. And in this state of affairs they 
held fellowship with each other; and Anicetus conceded to Polycarp in the Church 
the celebration of the Eucharist, by way of showing him respect; so that they 
parted in peace one from the other, maintaining peace with the whole Church, 
both those who did observe [this custom] and those who did not. 
IV. 
As long as any one has the means of doing good to his neighbours, and does 
not do so, he shall be reckoned a stranger to the love of the Lord. 
V. 
The will and the energy of God is the effective and foreseeing cause of every 
time and place and age, and of every nature. The will is the reason 
(logos) of the intellectual soul, which [reason] is within us, inasmuch 
as it is the faculty belonging to it which is endowed with freedom of action. 
The will is the mind desiring [some object], and an appetite possessed of 
intelligence, yearning after that thing which is desired. 
VI. 
Since God is vast, and the Architect of the world, and omnipotent, He created 
things that reach to immensity both by the Architect of the world and by an 
omnipotent will, and with a new effect, potently and efficaciously, in order 
that the entire fulness of those things which have been produced might come into 
being, although they had no previous existence--that is, whatever does not fall 
under [our] observation, and also what lies before our eyes. And so does He 
contain all things in particular, and leads them on to their own proper result, 
on account of which they were called into being and produced, in no way changed 
into anything else than what it (the end) had originally been by nature. For 
this is the property of the working of God, not merely to proceed to the 
infinitude of the understanding, or even to overpass [our] powers of mind, 
reason and speech, time and place, and every age; but also to go beyond 
substance, and fulness or perfection, 
VII. 
This [custom], of not bending the knee upon Sunday, is a symbol of the 
resurrection, through which we have been set free, by the grace of Christ, from 
sins, and from death, which has been put to death under Him. Now this custom 
took its rise from apostolic times, as the blessed Irenaeus, the martyr and 
bishop of Lyons, declares in his treatise On Easter, in which he makes mention 
of Pentecost also; upon which [feast] we do not bend the knee, because it is of 
equal significance with the Lord's day, for the reason already alleged 
concerning it. 
VIII. 
For as the ark [of the covenant] was glided within and without with pure 
gold, so was also the body of Christ pure and resplendent; for it was adorned 
within by the Word, and shielded without by the Spirit, in order that from both 
[materials] the splendour of the natures might be clearly shown forth. 
IX. 
Ever, indeed, speaking well of the deserving, but never ill of the 
undeserving, we also shall attain to the glory and kingdom of God. 
X. 
It is indeed proper to God, and befitting His character, to show mercy and 
pity, and to bring salvation to His creatures, even though they be brought under 
danger of destruction. "For with Him," says the Scripture, "is propitiation." 
XI. 
The business of the Christian is nothing else than to be ever preparing for 
death meleman amoqnhskein). 
XII. 
We therefore have formed the belief that [our] bodies also do rise again. For 
although they go to corruption, yet they do not perish; for the earth, receiving 
the remains, preserves them, even like fertile seed mixed with more fertile 
ground. Again, as a bare grain is sown, and, germinating by the command of God 
its Creator, rises again, clothed upon and glorious, but not before it has died 
and suffered decomposition, and become mingled with the earth; so [it is seen 
from this, that] we have not entertained a vain belief in the resurrection of 
the body. But although it is dissolved at the appointed time, because of the 
primeval disobedience, it is placed, as it were, in the crucible of the earth, 
to be recast again; not then as this corruptible [body], but pure, and no longer 
subject to decay: so that to each body its own soul shall be restored; and when 
it is clothed upon with this, it shall not experience sorrow, but shall rejoice, 
continuing permanently in a state of purity, having for its companion a just 
consort, not an insidious one, possessing in every respect the things pertaining 
to it, it shall receive these with perfect accuracy; it shall not receive bodies 
diverse from what they had been, nor delivered from suffering or disease, nor as 
[rendered] glorious, but as they departed this life, in sins or in righteous 
actions: and such as they were, such shall they be clothed with upon resuming 
life; and such as they were in unbelief, such shall they be faithfully judged. 
XIII. 
For when the Greeks, having arrested the slaves of Christian catechumens, 
then used force against them, in order to learn from them some secret thing 
[practised] among Christians, these slaves, having nothing to say that would 
meet the wishes of their tormentors, except that they had heard from their 
masters that the divine communion was the body and blood of Christ, and 
imagining that it was actually flesh and blood, gave their inquisitors answer to 
that effect. Then these latter, assuming such to be the case with regard to the 
practices of Christians, gave information regarding it to other Greeks, and 
sought to compel the martyrs Sanctus and Blandina to confess, under the 
influence of torture, [that the allegation was correct]. To these men Blandina 
replied very admirably in these words: "How should those persons endure such 
[accusations], who, for the sake of the practice [of piety], did not avail 
themselves even of the flesh that was permitted [them to eat]?" 
XVI. 
How is it possible to say that the serpent, created by God dumb and 
irrational, was endowed with reason and speech? For if it had the power of 
itself to speak, to discern, to understand, and to reply to what was spoken by 
the woman, there would have been nothing to prevent every serpent from doing 
this also. If, however, they say again that it was according to the divine will 
and dispensation that this [serpent] spake with a human voice to Eve, they 
render God the author of sin. Neither was it possible for the evil demon to 
impart speech to a speechless nature, and thus from that which is not to produce 
that which is; for if that were the case, he never would have ceased (with the 
view of leading men astray) from conferring with and deceiving them by means of 
serpents, and beasts, and birds. From what quarter, too, did it, being a beast, 
obtain information regarding the injunction of God to the man given to him 
alone, and in secret, not even the woman herself being aware of it? Why also did 
it not prefer to make its attack upon the man instead of the woman? And if thou 
sayest that it attacked her as being the weaker of the two, [I reply that], on 
the contrary, she was the stronger, since she appears to have been the helper of 
the man in the transgression of the commandment. For she did by herself alone 
resist the serpent, and it was after holding out for a while and making 
opposition that she ate of the tree, being circumvented by craft; whereas Adam, 
making no fight whatever, nor refusal, partook of the fruit handed to him by the 
woman, which is an indication of the utmost imbecility and effeminacy of mind. 
And the woman indeed, having been vanquished in the contest by a demon, is 
deserving of pardon; but Adam shall deserve none, for he was worsted by a 
woman,--he who, in his own person, had received the command from God. But the 
woman, having heard of the command from Adam, treated it with contempt, either 
because she deemed it unworthy of God to speak by means of it, or because she 
had her doubts, perhaps even held the opinion that the command was given to her 
by Adam of his own accord. The serpent found her working alone, so that he was 
enabled to confer with her apart. Observing her then either eating or not eating 
from the trees, he put before her the fruit of the [forbidden] tree. And if he 
saw her eating, it is manifest that she was partaker of a body subject to 
corruption. "For everything going in at the mouth, is cast out into the 
draught." If then corruptible, it is obvious that she was also mortal. But if 
mortal, then there was certainly no curse; nor was that a [condemnatory] 
sentence, when the voice of God spake to the man, "For earth thou art, and unto 
earth shall thou return," as the true course of things proceeds [now and 
always]. Then again, if the serpent observed the woman not eating, how did he 
induce her to eat who never had eaten? And who pointed out to this accursed 
man-slaying serpent that the sentence of death pronounced against them by God 
would not take [immediate] effect, when He said, "For in the day that ye eat 
thereof, ye shall surely die?" And not this merely, but that along with the 
impunity [attending their sin] the eyes of those should be opened who had not 
seen until then? But with the opening [of their eyes] referred to, they made 
entrance upon the path of death. 
XV. 
When, in times of old, Balaam spake these things in parables, he was not 
acknowledged; and now, when Christ has appeared and fulfilled them, He was not 
believed. Wherefore [Balaam], foreseeing this, and wondering at it, exclaimed, 
"Alas! alas! who shall live when God brings these things to pass?" 
XVI. 
Expounding again the law to that generation which followed those who were 
shin in the wilderness, he published Deuteronomy; not as giving to them a 
different law from that which had been appointed for their fathers, but as 
recapitulating this latter, in order that they, by hearing what had happened to 
their fathers, might fear God with their whole heart. 
XVII. 
By these Christ was typified, and acknowledged, and brought into the world; 
for He was prefigured in Joseph: then from Levi and Judah He was descended 
according to the flesh, as King and Priest; and He was acknowledged by Simeon in 
the temple: through Zebulon He was believed in among the Gentiles, as says the 
prophet, "the land of Zabulon;" and through Benjamin [that is, Paul] He was 
glorified, by being preached throughout all the world. 
XVIII. 
And this was not without meaning; but that by means of the number of the ten 
men, he (Gideon) might appear as having Jesus for a helper, as [is indicated] by 
the compact entered into with them. And when he did not choose to partake with 
them in their idol-worship, they threw the blame upon him: for "Jerubbaal" 
signifies the judgment-seat of Baal. 
XIX. 
"Take unto thee Joshua ('Ihsoun) the son of Nun." For it was proper 
that Moses should lead the people out of Egypt, but that Jesus (Joshua) should 
lead them into the inheritance. Also that Moses, as was the case with the law, 
should cease to be, but that Joshua ('Ihsoun), as the word, and no untrue 
type of the Word made flesh (enupostatou), should be a preacher to the 
people. Then again, [it was fit] that Moses should give manna as food to the 
fathers, but Joshua wheat; as the first-fruits of life, a type of the body of 
Christ, as also the Scripture declares that the manna of the Lord ceased when 
the people had eaten wheat from the land. 
XX. 
"And he laid his hands upon him." The countenance of Joshua was also 
glorified by the imposition of the hands of Moses, but not to the same degree 
[as that of Moses]. Inasmuch, then, as he had obtained a certain degree of 
grace, [the Lord] said, "And thou shall confer upon him of thy glory." For [in 
this case] the thing given does not cease to belong to the giver. 
XXI. 
But he does not give, as Christ did, by means of breathing, because he is not 
the fount of the Spirit. 
XXII. 
"Thou shall not go with them, neither shalt thou curse the people." He does 
not hint at anything with regard to the people, for they all lay before his 
view, but [he refers] to the mystery of Christ pointed out beforehand. For as He 
was to be born of the fathers according to the flesh, the Spirit gives 
instructions to the man (Balaam) beforehand, lest, going forth in ignorance, he 
might pronounce a curse upon the people. Not, indeed, that [his curse] could 
take any effect contrary to the will of God; but [this was done] as an 
exhibition of the providence of God which He exercised towards them on account 
of their forefathers. 
XXIII. 
"And he mounted upon his ass." The ass was the type of the body of Christ, 
upon whom all men, resting from their labours, are borne as in a chariot. For 
the Saviour has taken up the burden of our sins. Now the angel who appeared to 
Balaam was the Word Himself; and in His hand He held a sword, to indicate the 
power which He had from above. 
XXIV. 
"God is not as a man." He thus shows that all men are indeed guilty of 
falsehood, inasmuch as they change from one thing to another 
(metaferomenoi); but such is not the case with God, for He always 
continues true, perfecting whatever He wishes. 
XXV. 
"To inflict vengeance from the Lord on Midian." For this man (Balaam), when 
he speaks no longer in the Spirit of God, but contrary to God's law, by setting 
up a different law with regard to fornication, is certainly not then to be 
counted as a prophet, but as a soothsayer. For he who did not keep to the 
commandment of God, received the just recompense of his own evil devices. 
XXVI. 
Know thou that every man is either empty or full. For if he has not the Holy 
Spirit, he has no knowledge of the Creator; he has not received Jesus Christ the 
Life; he knows not the Father who is in heaven; if he does not live after the 
dictates of reason, after the heavenly law, he is not a sober-minded person, nor 
does he act uprightly: such an one is empty. If, on the other hand, he receives 
God, who says, "I will dwell with them, and walk in them, and I will be their 
God," such an one is not empty, but full. 
XXVII. 
The little boy, therefore, who guided Samson by the hand, pre-typified John 
the Baptist, who showed to the people the faith in Christ. And the house in 
which they were assembled signifies the world, in which dwell the various 
heathen and unbelieving nations, offering sacrifice to their idols. Moreover, 
the two pillars are the two covenants. The fact, then, of Samson leaning himself 
upon the pillars, [indicates] this, that the people, when instructed, recognized 
the mystery of Christ. 
XXVIII. 
"And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And 
he cut down a tree, and cast it in there, and the iron floated." This was a sign 
that souls should be borne aloft (anagwghs yukwn) through the 
instrumentality of wood, upon which He suffered who can lead those souls aloft 
that follow His ascension. This event was also an indication of the fact, that 
when the holy soul of Christ descended [to Hades], many souls ascended and were 
seen in their bodies. For just as the wood, which is the lighter body, was 
submerged in the water; but the iron, the heavier one, floated: so, when the 
Word of God became one with flesh, by a physical and hypostatic union, the heavy 
and terrestrial [part], having been rendered immortal, was borne up into heaven, 
by the divine nature, after the resurrection. 
XXIX. 
The Gospel according to Matthew was written to the Jews. For they laid 
particular stress upon the fact that Christ [should be] of the seed of David. 
Matthew also, who had a still greater desire [to establish this point], took 
particular pains to afford them convincing proof that Christ is of the seed of 
David; and therefore he commences with [an account of] His genealogy. 
XXX. 
"The axe unto the root," he says, urging us to the knowledge of the truth, 
and purifying us by means of fear, as well as preparing to bring forth fruit in 
due season. 
XXXI. 
Observe that, by means of the grain of mustard seed in the parable, the 
heavenly doctrine is denoted which is sown like seed in the world, as in a 
field, [seed] which has an inherent force, fiery and powerful. For the Judge of 
the whole world is thus proclaimed, who, having been hidden in the heart of the 
earth in a tomb for three days, and having become a great tree, has stretched 
forth His branches to the ends of the earth. Sprouting out from Him, the twelve 
apostles, having become fair and fruitful boughs, were made a shelter for the 
nations as for the fowls of heaven, under which boughs, all having taken refuge, 
as birds flocking to a nest, have been made partakers of that wholesome and 
celestial food which is derived from them. 
XXXII. 
Josephus says, that when Moses had been brought up in the royal palaces, he 
was chosen as general against the Ethiopians; and having proved victorious, 
obtained in marriage the daughter of that king, since indeed, out of her 
affection for him, she delivered the city up to him; Why was it, that when these 
two (Aaron and Miriam) had both acted with despite towards him (Moses), the 
latter alone was adjudged punishment? First, because the woman was the more 
culpable, since both nature and the law place the woman in a subordinate 
condition to the man. Or perhaps it was that Aaron was to a certain degree 
excusable, in consideration of his being the eider [brother], and adorned with 
the dignity of high priest. Then again, inasmuch as the leper was accounted by 
the law unclean, while at the same time the origin and foundation of the 
priesthood lay in Aaron, [the Lord] did not award a similar punishment to him, 
lest this stigma should attach itself to the entire [sacerdotal] race; but by 
means of his sister's [example] He awoke his fears, and taught him the same 
lesson. For Miriam's punishment affected him to such an extent, that no sooner 
did she experience it, than he entreated Moses], who had been injured, that he 
would be his intercession do away with the affliction. And he did not neglect to 
do so, but at once poured forth his supplication. Upon this the Lord, who loves 
mankind, made him understand how He had not chastened her as a judge, but as a 
father; for He said, "If her father had spit in her face, should she not be 
ashamed? Let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her 
come in again." 
XXXIII. 
Inasmuch as certain men, impelled by what considerations I know not, remove 
from God the half of His creative power, by asserting that He is merely the 
cause of quality resident in matter, and by maintaining that matter itself is 
uncreated, come now let us put the question, What is at any time ... is 
immutable. Matter, then, is immutable. But if matter be immutable, and the 
immutable suffers no change in regard to quality, it does not form the substance 
of the world. For which reason it seems to them superfluous, that God has 
annexed qualities to matter, since indeed matter admits of no possible 
alteration, it being in itself an uncreated thing. But further, if matter be 
uncreated, it has been made altogether according to a certain quality, and this 
immutable, so that it cannot be receptive of more qualifies, nor can it be the 
thing of which the world is made. But if the word be not made from it, [this 
theory] entirely excludes God from exercising power on the creation [of the 
world]. 
XXXIV. 
"And dipped himself," says [the Scripture], "seven times in Jordan." It was 
not for nothing that Naaman of old, when suffering from leprosy, was purified 
upon his being baptized, but [it served] as an indication to us. For as we are 
lepers in sin, we are made clean, by means of the sacred water and the 
invocation of the Lord, from our old transgressions; being spiritually 
regenerated as new-born babes, even as the Lord has declared: "Except a man be 
born again through water and the Spirit, he shall not enter into the kingdom of 
heaven." 
XXXV. 
If the corpse of Elisha raised a dead man, how much more shall God, when He 
has quickened men's dead bodies, bring them up for judgment? 
XXXVI. 
True knowledge, then, consists in the understanding of Christ, which Paul 
terms the wisdom of God hidden in a mystery, which "the natural man receiveth 
not," the doctrine of the cross; of which if any man "taste," he will not accede 
to the disputations and quibbles of proud and puffed-up men, who go into matters 
of which they have no perception. For the truth is unsophisticated 
(askhmatistos); and "the word is nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy 
heart," as the same apostle declares, being easy of comprehension to those who 
are obedient. For it renders us like to Christ, if we experience "the power of 
his resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings." For this is the affinity 
of the apostolical teaching and the most holy "faith delivered unto us," which 
the unlearned receive, and those of slender knowledge have taught, not "giving 
heed to endless genealogies," but studying rather [to observe] a straightforward 
course of life; lest, having been deprived of the Divine Spirit, they fail to 
attain to the kingdom of heaven. For truly the first thing is to deny one's self 
and to follow Christ; and those who do this are borne onward to perfection, 
having fulfilled all their Teacher's will, becoming sons of God by spiritual 
regeneration, and heirs of the kingdom of heaven; those who seek which first 
shall not be forsaken. 
XXXVII. 
Those who have become acquainted with the secondary (i.e., under Christ) 
constitutions of' the apostles, are aware that the Lord instituted a new 
oblation in the new covenant, according to [the declaration of] Malachi the 
prophet. For, "from the rising of the sun even to the setting my name has been 
glorified among the Gentiles, and in every place incense is offered to my name, 
and a pure sacrifice;" as John also declares in the Apocalypse: "The incense is 
the prayers of the saints." Then again, Paul exhorts us "to present our bodies a 
living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service." 
And again, "Let us offer the sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of the 
lips." Now those oblations are not according to the law, the handwriting of 
which the Lord took away from the midst by cancelling it; but they are according 
to the Spirit, for we must worship God "in spirit and in truth." And therefore 
the oblation of the Eucharist is not a carnal one, but a spiritual; and in this 
respect it is pure. For we make an oblation to God of the bread and the cup of 
blessing, giving Him thanks in that He has commanded the earth to bring forth 
these fruits for our nourishment. And then, when we have perfected the oblation, 
we invoke the Holy Spirit, that He may exhibit this sacrifice, both the bread 
the body of Christ, and the cup the blood of Christ, in order that the receivers 
of these antitypes may obtain remission of sins and life eternal. Those persons, 
then, who perform these oblations in remembrance of the Lord, do not fall in 
with Jewish views, but, performing the service after a spiritual manner, they 
shall be called sons of wisdom. 
XXXVIII. 
The apostles ordained, that "we should not judge any one in respect to meat 
or drink, or in regard to a feast day, or the new moons, or the sabbaths.'' 
Whence then these contentions? whence these schisms? We keep the feast, but in 
the leaven of malice and wickedness, cutting in pieces the Church of God; and we 
preserve what belongs to its exterior, that we may cast away these better 
things, faith and love. We have heard from the prophetic words that these feasts 
and fasts are displeasing to the Lord. 
XXXIX. 
Christ, who was called the Son of God before the ages, was manifested in the 
fulness of time, in order that He might cleanse us through His blood, who were 
under the power of sin, presenting us as pure sons to His Father, if we yield 
ourselves obediently to the chastisement of the Spirit. And in the end of time 
He shall come to do away with all evil, and to reconcile all things, in order 
that there may be an end of all impurities. 
XL. 
"And he found the jaw-bone of an ass." It is to be observed that, after 
[Samson had committed] fornication, the holy Scripture no longer speaks of the 
things happily accomplished by him in connection with the formula, "The Spirit 
of the Lord came upon him." For thus, according to the holy apostle, the sin of 
fornication is perpetrated against the body, as involving also sin against the 
temple of God. 
XLI. 
This indicates the persecution against the Church set on foot by the nations 
who still continue in unbelief. But he (Samson) who suffered those things, 
trusted that there would be a retaliation against those waging this war. But 
retaliation through what means? First of all, by his betaking himself to the 
Rock not cognizable to the senses; secondly, by the finding of the jaw-bone of 
an ass. Now the type of the jaw-bone is the body of Christ. 
XLII. 
Speaking always well of the worthy, but never ill of the unworthy, we also 
shall attain to the glory and kingdom of God. 
XLIII. 
In these things there was signified by prophecy that the people, having 
become transgressors, shall be bound by the chains of their own sins. But the 
breaking of the bonds of their own accord indicates that, upon repentance, they 
shall be again loosed from the shackles of sin. 
XLIV. 
It is not an easy thing for a soul, under the influence Of error, to be 
persuaded of the contrary opinion. 
XLV. 
"And Balsam the son of Beor they slew with the sword." For, speaking no 
longer by the Spirit of God, but setting up another law of fornication contrary 
to the law of God, this man shall no longer be reckoned as a prophet, but as a 
soothsayer. For, as he did not continue in the commandment of God, he received 
the just reward of his evil devices. 
XLVI. 
"The god of the world;" that is, Satan, who was designated God to those who 
believe not. 
XLVII. 
The birth of John [the Baptist] brought the dumbness of Zacharias to an end. 
For he did not burden his father, when the voice issued forth from silence; but 
as when not believed it rendered him tongue-tied, so did the voice sounding out 
clearly set his father free, to whom he had both been announced and born. Now 
the voice and the burning light 20 were a precursor of the Word and the Light. 
XLVIII. 
As therefore seventy tongues are indicated by number, and from dispersion the 
tongues are gathered into one by means of their interpretation; so is that ark 
declared a type of the body of Christ, which is both pure and immaculate. For as 
that ark was gilded with pure gold both within and without, so also is the body 
of Christ pure and resplendent, being adorned within by the Word, and shielded 
on the outside by the Spirit, in order that from both [materials] the splendour 
of the natures might be exhibited together. 
XLIX. 
Now therefore, by means of this which has been already brought forth a long 
time since, the Word has assigned an interpretation. We are convinced that there 
exist [so to speak] two men in each one of us. The one is confessedly a hidden 
thing, while the other stands apparent; one is corporeal, the other spiritual; 
although the generation of both may be compared to that of twins. For both are 
revealed to the world as but one, for the soul was not anterior to the body in 
its essence; nor, in regard to its formation, did the body precede the soul: but 
both these were produced at one time; and their nourishment consists in purity 
and sweetness. 
L. 
For then there shall in truth be a common joy consummated to all those who 
believe unto life, and in each individual shall be confirmed the mystery of the 
Resurrection, and the hope of incorruption, and the commencement of the eternal 
kingdom, when God shall have destroyed death and the devil. For that human 
nature and flesh which has risen again from the dead shall die no more; but 
after it had been changed to incorruption, and made like to spirit, when the 
heaven was opened, [our Lord] full of glory offered it (the flesh) to the 
Father. 
LI. 
Now, however, inasmuch as the books of these men may possibly have escaped 
your observation, but have come under our notice, I call your attention to them, 
that for the sake of your reputation you may expel these writings from among 
you, as bringing disgrace upon you, since their author boasts himself as being 
one of your company. For they constitute a stumbling-block to many, who simply 
and unreservedly receive, as coming from a presbyter, the blasphemy which they 
utter against God. Just [consider] the writer of these things, how by means of 
them he does not injure assistants [in divine service] only, who happen to be 
prepared in mind for blasphemies against God, but also damages those among us, 
since by his books he imbues their minds with false doctrines concerning God. 
LII. 
The sacred books acknowledge with regard to Christ, that as He is the Son of 
man, so is the same Being not a [mere] man; and as He is flesh, so is He also 
spirit, and the Word of God, and God. And as He was born of Mary in the last 
times, so did He also proceed from God as the First-begotten of every creature; 
and as He hungered, so did He satisfy [others]; and as He thirsted, so did He of 
old cause the Jews to drink, for the "Rock was Christ" Himself: thus does Jesus 
now give to His believing people power to drink spiritual waters, which spring 
up to life eternal. And as He was the son of David, so was He also the Lord of 
David. And as He was from Abraham, so did He also exist before Abraham. And as 
He was the servant of God, so is He the Son of God, and Lord of the universe. 
And as He was spit upon ignominiously, so also did He breathe the Holy Spirit 
into His disciples. And as He was saddened, so also did He give joy to His 
people. And as He was capable of being handled and touched, so again did He, in 
a non-apprehensible form, pass through the midst of those who sought to injure 
Him, and entered without impediment through closed doors. And as He slept, so 
did He also rule the sea, the winds, and the storms. And as He suffered, so also 
is He alive, and life-giving, and healing all our infirmity. And as He died, so 
is He also the Resurrection of the dead. He suffered shame on earth, while He is 
higher than all glory and praise in heaven; who, "though He was crucified 
through weakness, yet He liveth by divine power;" who "descended into the lower 
parts of the earth," and who "ascended up above the heavens;" for whom a manger 
sufficed, yet who filled all things; who was dead, yet who liveth for ever and 
ever. Amen. 
LIII. 
With regard to Christ, the law and the prophets and the evangelists have 
proclaimed that He was born of a virgin, that He suffered upon a beam of wood, 
and that He appeared from the dead; that He also ascended to the heavens, and 
was glorified by the Father, and is the Eternal King; that He is the perfect 
Intelligence, the Word of God, who was begotten before the light; that He was 
the Founder of the universe, along with it (light), and the Maker of man; that 
He is All in all: Patriarch among the patriarchs; Law in the laws; Chief Priest 
among priests; Ruler among kings; the Prophet among prophets; the Angel among 
angels; the Man among men; Son in the Father; God in God; King to all eternity. 
For it is He who sailed [in the ark] along with Noah, and who guided Abraham; 
who was bound along with Isaac, and was a Wanderer with Jacob; the Shepherd of 
those who are saved, and the Bridegroom of the Church; the Chief also of the 
cherubim, the Prince of the angelic powers; God of God; Son of the Father; Jesus 
Christ; King for ever and ever. Amen. 
LIV. 
The law and the prophets and evangelists have declared that Christ was born 
of a virgin, and suffered on the cross; was raised also from the dead, and taken 
up to heaven; that He was glorified, and reigns for ever. He is Himself termed 
the Perfect Intellect, the Word of God. He is the First-begotten, after a 
transcendent manner, the Creator of man; All in all; Patriarch among the 
patriarchs; Law in the law; the Priest among priests; among kings Prime Leader; 
the Prophet among the prophets; the Angel among angels; the Man among men; Son 
in the Father; God in God; King to all eternity. He was sold with Joseph, and He 
guided Abraham; was bound along with Isaac, and wandered with Jacob; with Moses 
He was Leader, and, respecting the people, Legislator. He preached in the 
prophets; was incarnate of a virgin; born in Bethlehem; received by John, and 
baptized in Jordan; was tempted in the desert, and proved to be the Lord. He 
gathered the apostles together, and preached the kingdom of heaven; gave light 
to the blind, and raised the dead; was seen in the temple, but was not held by 
the people as worthy of credit; was arrested by the priests, conducted before 
Herod, and condemned in the presence of Pilate; He manifested Himself in the 
body, was suspended upon a beam of wood, and raised from the dead; shown to the 
apostles, and, having been carried up to heaven, sitteth on the right hand of 
the Father, and has been glorified by Him as the Resurrection of the dead. 
Moreover, He is the Salvation of the lost, the Light to those dwelling in 
darkness, and Redemption to those who have been born; the Shepherd of the saved, 
and the Bridegroom of the Church; the Charioteer of the cherubim, the Leader of 
the angelic host; God of God; Jesus Christ our Saviour. 
LV. 
"Then drew near unto Him the mother of Zebedee's children, with her sons, 
worshipping, and seeking a certain thing from Him." These people are certainly 
not void of understanding, nor are the words set forth in that passage of no 
signification: being stated beforehand like a preface, they have some agreement 
with those points formerly expounded. "Then drew near." Sometimes virtue excites 
our admiration, not merely on account of the display which is given of it, but 
also of the occasion when it was manifested. I may refer, for example, to the 
premature fruit of the grape, or of the fig, or to any fruit whatsoever, from 
which, during its process [of growth], no man expects maturity or full 
development; yet, although any one may perceive that it is still somewhat 
imperfect, he does not for that reason despise as useless the immature grape 
when plucked, but he gathers it with pleasure as appearing early in the season; 
nor does he consider whether the grape is possessed of perfect sweetness; nay, 
he at once experiences satisfaction from the thought that this one has appeared 
before the rest. Just in the same way does God also, when He perceives the 
faithful possessing wisdom though still imperfect, and but a small degree of 
faith, overlook their defect in this respect, and therefore does not reject 
them; nay, but on the contrary, He kindly welcomes and accepts them as premature 
fruits, and honours the mind, whatsoever it may be, which is stamped with 
virtue, although not yet perfect. He makes allowance for it, as being among the 
harbingers of the vintage, and esteems it highly, inasmuch as, being of a 
readier disposition than the rest, it has forestalled, as it were, the blessing 
to itself. Abraham therefore, Isaac, and Jacob, our fathers, are to be esteemed 
before all, since they did indeed afford us such early examples of virtue. How 
many martyrs can be compared to Daniel? How many martyrs, I ask, can rival the 
three youths in Babylon, although the memory of the former has not been brought 
before us so conspicuously as that of the latter? These were truly first-fruits, 
and indications of the [succeeding] fructification. Hence God has directed their 
life to be recorded, as a model for those who should come after. 
And that their virtue was thus accepted by God, as the first-fruits of the 
produce, hear what He has Himself declared: "As a grape," He says, "I have found 
Israel in the wilderness, and as first-ripe figs your fathers." Call not 
therefore the faith of Abraham merely blessed because he believed. Do you wish 
to look upon Abraham with admiration? Then behold how that one man alone 
professed piety when in the world six hundred had been contaminated with error. 
Dost thou wish Daniel to carry thee away to amazement? Behold that [city] 
Babylon, haughty in the flower and pride of impiousness, and its inhabitants 
completely given over to sin of every description. But he, emerging from the 
depth, spat out the brine of sins, and rejoiced to plunge into the sweet waters 
of piety. And now, in like manner, with regard to that mother of Zebedee's 
children, do not admire merely what she said, but also the time at which she 
uttered these words. For when was it that she drew near to the Redeemer? Not 
after the resurrection, nor after the preaching of His name, nor after the 
establishment of His kingdom; but it was when the Lord said, "Behold, we go up 
to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the 
scribes; and they shall kill Him, and on the third day He shall rise again." 
These things the Saviour told in reference to His sufferings and cross; to 
these persons He predicted His passion. Nor did He conceal the fact that it 
should be of a most ignominious kind, at the hands of the chief priests. This 
woman, however, had attached another meaning to the dispensation of His 
sufferings. The Saviour was foretelling death; and she asked for the glory of 
immortality. The Lord was asserting that He must stand arraigned before impious 
judges; but she, taking no note of that judgment, requested as of the judge: 
"Grant," she said, "that these my two sons may sit, one on the right hand, and 
the other on the left, in Thy glory." In the one case the passion is referred 
to, in the other the kingdom is understood. The Saviour was speaking of the 
cross, while she had in view the glory which admits no suffering. This woman, 
therefore, as I have already said, is worthy of our admiration, not merely for 
what she sought, but also for the occasion of her making the request. 
She did indeed suffer, not merely as a pious person, but also as a woman. 
For, having been instructed by His words, she considered and believed that it 
would come to pass, that the kingdom of Christ should flourish in glory, and 
walk in its vastness throughout the world, and be increased by the preaching of 
piety. She understood, as was [in fact] the case, that He who appeared in a 
lowly guise had delivered and received every promise. I will inquire upon 
another occasion, when I come to treat upon this humility, whether the Lord 
rejected her petition concerning His kingdom. But she thought that the same 
confidence would not be possessed by her, when, at the appearance of the angels, 
He should be ministered to by the angels, and receive service from the entire 
heavenly host. Taking the Saviour, therefore, apart in a retired place, she 
earnestly desired of Him those things which transcend every human nature.
