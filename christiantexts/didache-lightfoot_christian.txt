Didache















The Didache or Teaching of the Apostles
APOSTOLIC FATHERS (trans. and ed., J. B. Lightfoot)
1:1 There are two ways, one of life and one of death, and there is a 
great difference between the two ways.1:2 {The way of life} is this.1:3 
First of all, {thou shalt love the God} that made thee;1:4 secondly, {thy 
neighbour as thyself.}1:5 {And all things whatsoever thou wouldest not have 
befal thyself neither do thou unto another.}1:6 Now of these words the 
doctrine is this.1:7 {Bless them that curse you, and pray for} your enemies 
and fast for {them that persecute you;1:8 for what thank is it, if ye love 
them that love you? Do not even the Gentiles the same? But do ye love them that 
hate you,} and ye shall not have an enemy.1:9 Abstain thou from fleshly and 
bodily lusts.1:10 {If any man give thee a blow on thy right cheek, turn to 
him the other also,} and thou shalt be perfect;1:11 {if a man impress thee 
to go with him, one mile, go with him twain;1:12 if a man take away thy 
cloak, give him thy coat also;1:13 if a man take away from thee that which 
is thine own, ask it not back,} for neither art thou able.1:14 {To every man 
that asketh of thee give, and ask not back;}1:15 for the Father desireth 
that gifts be given to all from His own bounties.1:16 Blessed is he that 
giveth according to the commandment;1:17 for he is guiltless.1:18 Woe to 
him that receiveth;1:19 for, if a man receiveth having need, he is 
guiltless;1:20 but he that hath no need shall give satisfaction why and 
wherefore he received;1:21 and being put in confinement he shall be examined 
concerning the deeds that he hath done, and {he shall not come out thence until 
he hath given back the last farthing.}1:22 Yea, as touching this also it is 
said;1:23 {Let thine alms sweat into thine hands, until thou shalt have 
learnt to whom to give.}
2:1 And this is the second commandment of the teaching.2:2 {Thou 
shalt do no murder, thou shalt not commit adultery,} thou shalt not corrupt 
boys, thou shalt not commit fornication, {thou shalt not steal,} thou shalt not 
deal in magic, thou shalt do no sorcery, thou shalt not murder a child by 
abortion nor kill them when born, {thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's goods, 
thou shalt not perjure thyself, thou shalt not bear false witness,} thou shalt 
not speak evil, thou shalt not cherish a grudge, thou shalt not be double-minded 
nor double-tongued;2:3 for the double tongue is a snare of death.2:4 Thy 
word shall not be false or empty, but fulfilled by action.2:5 Thou shalt not 
be avaricious nor a plunderer nor a hypocrite nor ill-tempered nor proud.2:6 
Thou shalt not entertain an evil design against thy neighbour.2:7 {Thou 
shalt not hate} any man, {but some thou shalt reprove,} and for others thou 
shalt pray, {and others thou shalt love} more than thy life.
3:1 My child, flee from every evil and everything that resembleth 
it.3:2 Be not angry, for anger leadeth to murder, nor jealous nor 
contentious nor wrathful;3:3 for of all these things murders are 
engendered.3:4 My child, be not lustful, for lust leadeth to fornication, 
neither foul-speaking neither with uplifted eyes;3:5 for of all these things 
adulteries are engendered.3:6 My child, {be no dealer in omens,} since it 
leads to idolatry, nor an enchanter nor an astrologer nor a magician, neither be 
willing to look at them;3:7 for from all these things idolatry is 
engendered.3:8 My child, be not a liar, since lying leads to theft, neither 
avaricious neither vainglorious;3:9 for from all these things thefts are 
engendered.3:10 My child, be not a murmurer, since it leadeth to blasphemy, 
neither self-willed neither a thinker of evil thoughts;3:11 for from all 
these things blasphemies are engendered.3:12 But be meek, since {the meek 
shall inherit the earth.}3:13 Be long-suffering and pitiful and guileless 
and {quiet} and kindly {and} always {fearing the words} which thou hast 
heard.3:14 Thou shalt not exalt thyself, neither shalt thou admit boldness 
into thy soul.3:15 Thy soul shall not cleave together with the lofty, but 
with the righteous and humble shalt thou walk.3:16 The accidents that befal 
thee thou shalt receive as good, knowing that nothing is done without 
God.
4:1 My child, {thou shalt remember him that speaketh unto thee the 
word of God} night and day, and shalt honour him as the Lord;4:2 for 
whencesoever the Lordship speaketh, there is the Lord.4:3 Moreover thou 
shalt seek out day by day the persons of the saints, that thou mayest find rest 
in their words.4:4 Thou shalt not make a schism, but thou shalt pacify them 
that contend;4:5 thou shalt judge righteously, thou shalt not make a 
difference in a person to reprove him for transgressions.4:6 Thou shalt not 
doubt whether a thing shall be or not be.4:7 {Be not thou found holding out 
thy hands to receive, but drawing them in as to giving.}4:8 If thou hast 
ought passing through thy hands, thou shalt give a ransom for thy sins.4:9 
Thou shalt not hesitate to give, neither shalt thou murmur when giving;4:10 
for thou shalt know who is the good paymaster of thy reward.4:11 Thou shalt 
not turn away from him that is in want, but shalt make thy brother partaker in 
all things, and shalt not say {that anything is thine own.}4:12 For if ye 
are fellow-partakers in that which is imperishable, how much rather in the 
things which are perishable? Thou shalt not withhold thy hand from thy son or 
from thy daughter, but from their youth thou shalt teach them the fear of 
God.4:13 Thou shalt not command thy bondservant or thine handmaid in thy 
bitterness, who trust in the same God as thyself, lest haply they should cease 
to fear the God who is over both of you;4:14 for He cometh, not to call men 
with respect of persons, but He cometh to those whom the Spirit hath 
prepared.4:15 But ye, servants, shall be subject unto your masters, as to a 
type of God, in shame and fear.®LA1¯4:16 Thou shalt hate all hypocrisy, and 
everything that is not pleasing to the Lord.4:17 Thou shalt never forsake 
the commandments of the Lord;4:18 but shalt keep those things which thou 
hast received, neither adding to them nor taking away from them.4:19 In 
church thou shalt confess thy transgressions, and shalt not betake thyself to 
prayer with an evil conscience.4:20 This is the way of life.
5:1 But the way of death is this.5:2 First of all, it is evil and 
full of a curse murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries, 
magical arts, witchcrafts, plunderings, false witnessings, hypocrisies, 
doubleness of heart, treachery, pride, malice, stubbornness, covetousness, 
foul-speaking, jealousy, boldness, exaltation, boastfulness;5:3 persecutors 
of good men, hating truth, loving a lie, not perceiving the reward of 
righteousness, not {cleaving to the good} nor to righteous judgment, wakeful not 
for that which is good but for that which is evil;5:4 from whom gentleness 
and forbearance stand aloof;5:5 loving vain things, pursuing a recompense, 
not pitying the poor man, not toiling for him that is oppressed with toil, not 
recognizing Him that made them, murderers of children, corrupters of the 
creatures of God, turning away from him that is in want, oppressing him that is 
afflicted, advocates of the wealthy, unjust judges of the poor, altogether 
sinful.5:6 May ye be delivered, my children, from all these 
things.
6:1 See lest any man lead you astray from this way of righteousness, 
for he teacheth thee apart from God.6:2 For if thou art able to bear the 
whole yoke of the Lord, thou shalt be perfect;6:3 but if thou art not able, 
do that which thou art able.6:4 But concerning eating, bear that which thou 
art able;6:5 yet abstain by all means from meat sacrificed to idols;6:6 
for it is the worship of dead gods.
7:1 But concerning baptism, thus shall ye baptize.7:2 Having 
first recited all these things, baptize {in the name of the Father and of the 
Son and of the Holy Spirit} in living (running) water.7:3 But if thou hast 
not living water, then baptize in other water;7:4 and if thou art not able 
in cold, then in warm.7:5 But if thou hast neither, then pour water on the 
head thrice in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy 
Spirit.7:6 But before the baptism let him that baptizeth and him that is 
baptized fast, and any others also who are able;7:7 and thou shalt order him 
that is baptized to fast a day or two before.
8:1 And let not your fastings be with the hypocrites, for they fast 
on the second and the fifth day of the week;8:2 but do ye keep your fast on 
the fourth and on the preparation (the sixth) day.8:3 Neither pray ye {as 
the hypocrites,} but as the Lord commanded in His Gospel, {thus pray ye.8:4 
Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name;8:5 Thy kingdom 
come;8:6 Thy will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth;8:7 give us 
this day our daily bread;8:8 and forgive us our debt, as we also forgive our 
debtors;8:9 and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil 
one;}8:10 for Thine is the power and the glory for ever and ever.8:11 
Three times in the day pray ye so.
9:1 But as touching the eucharistic thanksgiving give ye thanks 
thus.9:2 First, as regards the cup:9:3 We give Thee thanks, O our 
Father, for the holy vine of Thy son David, which Thou madest known unto us 
through Thy Son Jesus;9:4 Thine is the glory for ever and ever.9:5 Then 
as regards the broken bread:9:6 We give Thee thanks, O our Father, for the 
life and knowledge which Thou didst make known unto us through Thy Son 
Jesus;9:7 Thine is the glory for ever and ever.9:8 As this broken bread 
was scattered upon the mountains and being gathered together became one, so may 
Thy Church be gathered together from the ends of the earth into Thy 
kingdom;9:9 for Thine is the glory and the power through Jesus Christ for 
ever and ever.9:10 But let no one eat or drink of this eucharistic 
thanksgiving, but they that have been baptized into the name of the 
Lord;9:11 for concerning this also the Lord hath said:9:12 {Give not 
that which is holy to the dogs.}
10:1 And after ye are satisfied thus give ye thanks:10:2 We give 
Thee thanks, Holy Father, for Thy holy name, which Thou hast made to tabernacle 
in our hearts, and for the knowledge and faith and immortality, which Thou hast 
made known unto us through Thy Son Jesus;10:3 Thine is the glory for ever 
and ever.10:4 Thou, Almighty Master, didst create all things for Thy name's 
sake, and didst give food and drink unto men for enjoyment, that they might 
render thanks to Thee;10:5 but didst bestow upon us spiritual food and drink 
and eternal life through Thy Son.10:6 Before all things we give Thee thanks 
that Thou art powerful;10:7 Thine is the glory for ever and ever.10:8 
Remember, Lord, Thy Church to deliver it from all evil and to perfect it in Thy 
love;10:9 and {gather it together from the four winds}--even the Church 
which has been sanctified--into Thy kingdom which Thou hast prepared for 
it;10:10 for Thine is the power and the glory for ever and ever.10:11 
May grace come and may this world pass away.10:12 Hosanna to the God of 
David.10:13 If any man is holy, let him come;10:14 if any man is not, 
let him repent. Maran Atha. Amen.10:15 But permit the prophets to offer 
thanksgiving as much as they desire.
11:1 Whosoever therefore shall come and teach you all these things 
that have been said before, receive him;11:2 but if the teacher himself be 
perverted and teach a different doctrine to the destruction thereof, hear him 
not;11:3 but if to the increase of righteousness and the knowledge of the 
Lord, receive him as the Lord.11:4 But concerning the apostles and prophets, 
so do ye according to the ordinance of the Gospel.11:5 Let every apostle, 
when he cometh to you, be received as the Lord;11:6 but he shall not abide 
more than a single day, or if there be need, a 11:7 but if he abide three days, 
he is a false prophet.11:8 And when he departeth let the apostle receive 
nothing save bread, until he findeth shelter;11:9 but if he ask money, he is 
a false prophet.11:10 And any prophet speaking in the Spirit ye shall not 
try neither discern;11:11 for every sin shall be forgiven, but this sin 
shall not be forgiven.11:12 Yet not every one that speaketh in the Spirit is 
a prophet, but only if he have the ways of the Lord.11:13 From his ways 
therefore the false prophet and the prophet shall be recognized.11:14 And no 
prophet when he ordereth a table in the Spirit shall eat of it;11:15 
otherwise he is a false prophet.11:16 And every prophet teaching the truth, 
if he doeth not what he teacheth, is a false prophet.11:17 And every prophet 
approved and found true, if he doeth ought as an outward mystery typical of the 
Church, and yet teacheth you not to do all that he himself doeth, shall not be 
judged before you;11:18 he hath his judgment in the presence of 
God;11:19 for in like manner also did the prophets of old time.11:20 And 
whosoever shall say in the Spirit, Give me silver or anything else, ye shall not 
listen to him;11:21 but if he tell you to give on behalf of others that are 
in want, let no man judge him.
12:1 But let every one {that cometh in the name of the Lord} be 
received;12:2 and then when ye have tested him ye shall know him, for ye 
shall have understanding on the right hand and on the left.12:3 If the comer 
is a traveller, assist him, so far as ye are able;12:4 but he shall not stay 
with you more than two or three days, if it be necessary.12:5 But if he 
wishes to settle with you, being a craftsman, let him work for and eat his 
bread.12:6 But if he has no craft, according to your wisdom provide how he 
shall live as a Christian among you, but not in idleness.12:7 If he will not 
do this, he is trafficking upon Christ.12:8 Beware of such men.
13:1 But every true prophet desiring to settle among you {is worthy 
of his food.}13:2 In like manner a true teacher {is} also {worthy,} like 
{the workman, of his food.}13:3 Every firstfruit then of the produce of the 
wine-vat and of the threshing-floor, of thy oxen and of thy sheep, thou shalt 
take and give as the firstfruit to the prophets;13:4 for they are your 
chief-priests.13:5 But if ye have not a prophet, give them to the 
poor.13:6 If thou makest bread, take the firstfruit and give according to 
the commandment.13:7 In like manner, when thou openest a jar of wine or of 
oil, take the firstfruit and give to the prophets;13:8 yea and of money and 
raiment and every possession take the firstfruit, as shall seem good to thee, 
and give according to the commandment.
14:1 And on the Lord's own day gather yourselves together and break 
bread and give thanks, first confessing your transgressions, that your sacrifice 
may be pure.14:2 And let no man, having his dispute with his fellow, join 
your assembly until they have been reconciled, that your sacrifice may not be 
defiled;14:3 for this sacrifice it is that was spoken of by the 
Lord;14:4 {In every place and at every time offer Me a pure 
sacrifice;14:5 for I am a great king, saith the Lord and My name is 
wonderful among the nations.}
15:1 Appoint for yourselves therefore bishops and deacons worthy of 
the Lord, men who are meek and not lovers of money, and true and 
approved;15:2 for unto you they also perform the service of the prophets and 
teachers.15:3 Therefore despise them not;15:4 for they are your 
honourable men along with the prophets and teachers.15:5 And reprove one 
another, not in anger but in peace, as ye find in the Gospel;15:6 and let no 
one speak to any that has gone wrong towards his neighbour, neither let him hear 
a word from you, until he repent.15:7 But your prayers and your almsgivings 
and all your deeds so do ye as ye find it in the Gospel of our 
Lord.
16:1 {Be watchful} for your life;16:2 {let your lamps not be 
quenched and your loins not ungirded, but be ye ready;16:3 for ye know not 
the hour in which our Lord cometh.}16:4 And ye shall gather yourselves 
together frequently, seeking what is fitting for your souls;16:5 for the 
whole time of your faith shall not profit you, if ye be not perfected at the 
last season.16:6 For in the last days {the false prophets} and corrupters 
shall be multiplied, and the sheep shall be turned into wolves, and love shall 
be turned into hate.16:7 For as lawlessness increaseth, {they shall hate one 
another and shall persecute and betray.16:8 And then} the world-deceiver 
{shall appear} as a son of God;16:9 {and shall work signs and wonders,} and 
the earth shall be delivered into his hands;16:10 and he shall do unholy 
things, which have never been since the world began.16:11 Then all created 
mankind shall come to the fire of testing, and many shall be offended and 
perish;16:12 {but they that endure} in their faith {shall be saved} by the 
Curse Himself.16:13 {And then shall the signs} of the truth 
{appear;}16:14 first a sign of a rift in the heaven, then a sign of a voice 
of a trumpet, and thirdly a resurrection of the dead;16:15 yet not of all, 
but as it was said:16:16 {The Lord shall come and all His saints with 
Him.16:17 Then shall} the world {see the Lord coming upon the clouds of 
heaven.}
