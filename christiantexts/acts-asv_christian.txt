The Acts of the Apostles












The Acts of the Apostles

1:1The former treatise I made, O 
Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began both to do and to teach, 1:2until the day in which he was received 
up, after that he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit unto the 
apostles whom he had chosen: 1:3To whom he also showed himself alive 
after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty 
days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God: 1:4and, being assembled 
together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait 
for the promise of the Father, which, said he, ye heard from me: 1:5For 
John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not 
many days hence. 1:6They therefore, when they were come 
together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to 
Israel? 1:7And he said unto them, It is not for you 
to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within His own authority. 1:8But 
ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be 
my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and unto the 
uttermost part of the earth. 1:9And when he had said these things, as 
they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. 
1:10And while they were looking stedfastly 
into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; 1:11who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why 
stand ye looking into heaven? this Jesus, who was received up from you into 
heaven shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven. 1:12Then returned they unto Jerusalem from 
the mount called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey 
off. 1:13And when they were come in, they went 
up into the upper chamber, where they were abiding; both Peter and John and 
James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the 
son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James. 1:14These all with one accord continued 
stedfastly in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his 
brethren. 1:15And in these days Peter stood up in the 
midst of the brethren, and said (and there was a multitude of persons 
gathered together, about a hundred and twenty), 1:16Brethren, it was 
needful that the Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spake 
before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took 
Jesus. 1:17For he was numbered among us, and 
received his portion in this ministry. 1:18(Now this man obtained a field with the 
reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and 
all his bowels gushed out. 1:19And it became known to all the dwellers 
at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama, 
that is, The field of blood.) 1:20For it is written in the book of 
Psalms, 
 Let his habitation be made desolate, 
 And let no man dwell therein: 
and, 
 His office let another take. 
1:21Of the men therefore that have 
companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among 
us, 1:22beginning from the baptism of John, 
unto the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness 
with us of his resurrection. 1:23And they put forward two, Joseph called 
Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. 1:24And they prayed, 
and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show of these two the 
one whom thou hast chosen, 1:25to take the place in this ministry and 
apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place. 1:26And they gave lots for them; and the 
lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. 

2:1And when the day of Pentecost was now 
come, they were all together in one place. 2:2And suddenly there 
came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all 
the house where they were sitting. 2:3And there appeared unto them tongues 
parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them. 2:4And 
they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other 
tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. 2:5Now there were 
dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. 2:6And 
when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, 
because that every man heard them speaking in his own language. 2:7And 
they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak 
Galilaeans? 2:8And how hear we, every man in our own 
language wherein we were born? 2:9Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and 
the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, 2:10in 
Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and 
sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, 2:11Cretans and 
Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God. 2:12And they were all amazed, and were 
perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this? 2:13But others mocking 
said, They are filled with new wine. 2:14But Peter, standing up with the eleven, 
lifted up his voice, and spake forth unto them, saying, Ye men of Judaea, 
and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and give ear unto my 
words. 2:15For these are not drunken, as ye 
suppose; seeing it is but the third hour of the day. 2:16but this is that 
which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel: 
 2:17And it shall be in the last days, saith 
God, 
 I will pour forth of my Spirit upon all flesh: 
 And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, 
 And your young men shall see visions, 
 And your old men shall dream dreams: 
 2:18Yea and on my servants and on my 
handmaidens in those days 
 Will I pour forth of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy. 
 2:19And I will show wonders in the heaven 
above, 
 And signs on the earth beneath; 
 Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke: 
 2:20The sun shall be turned into darkness, 
 And the moon into blood, 
 Before the day of the Lord come, 
 That great and notable day. 
 2:21And it shall be, that whosoever shall 
call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. 
2:22Ye men of Israel, hear these words: 
Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto you by mighty works and wonders 
and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as ye yourselves know; 
2:23him, being delivered up by the 
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did 
crucify and slay: 2:24whom God raised up, having loosed the 
pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. 2:25For David saith concerning him, 
 I beheld the Lord always before my face; 
 For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: 
 2:26Therefore my heart was glad, and my 
tongue rejoiced; 
 Moreover my flesh also shall dwell in hope: 
 2:27Because thou wilt not leave my soul 
unto Hades, 
 Neither wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption. 
 2:28Thou madest known unto me the ways of 
life; 
 Thou shalt make me full of gladness with thy countenance. 
2:29Brethren, I may say unto you freely of 
the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us 
unto this day. 2:30Being therefore a prophet, and knowing 
that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he would 
set one upon his throne; 2:31he foreseeing this spake of the 
resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left unto Hades, nor did his 
flesh see corruption. 2:32This Jesus did God raise up, whereof we 
all are witnesses. 2:33Being therefore by the right hand of 
God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, 
he hath poured forth this, which ye see and hear. 2:34For David ascended 
not into the heavens: but he saith himself, 
 The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 
 2:35Till I make thine enemies the footstool 
of thy feet. 
2:36Let all the house of Israel therefore 
know assuredly, that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye 
crucified. 2:37Now when they heard this, they 
were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, 
Brethren, what shall we do? 2:38And Peter said unto them, Repent 
ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the 
remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 2:39For to you is the promise, and to your 
children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God 
shall call unto him. 2:40And with many other words he testified, 
and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation. 2:41They then that received his word were 
baptized: and there were added unto them in that day about three thousand 
souls. 2:42And they continued stedfastly in the 
apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. 2:43And fear came upon every soul: and many 
wonders and signs were done through the apostles. 2:44And all that 
believed were together, and had all things common; 2:45and they sold their 
possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need. 2:46And day by day, continuing stedfastly 
with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food 
with gladness and singleness of heart, 2:47praising God, and having favor with all 
the people. And the Lord added to them day by day those that were saved. 

3:1Now Peter and John were going up into 
the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. 3:2And 
a certain man that was lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid 
daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them 
that entered into the temple; 3:3who seeing Peter and John about to go 
into the temple, asked to receive an alms. 3:4And Peter, fastening 
his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look on us. 3:5And he gave heed 
unto them, expecting to receive something from them. 3:6But Peter said, 
Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, that give I thee. In the name of 
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk. 3:7And he took him by the right hand, and 
raised him up: and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength. 
3:8And leaping up, he stood, and began to 
walk; and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and 
praising God. 3:9And all the people saw him walking and 
praising God: 3:10and they took knowledge of him, that it 
was he that sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were 
filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him. 3:11And as he held Peter and John, all the 
people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly 
wondering. 3:12And when Peter saw it, he answered unto 
the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this man? or why fasten ye your 
eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk? 3:13The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and 
of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Servant Jesus; whom ye 
delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had determined to 
release him. 3:14But ye denied the Holy and Righteous 
One, and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you, 3:15and killed the 
Prince of life; whom God raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. 3:16And by faith in his name hath his name 
made this man strong, whom ye behold and know: yea, the faith which is through 
him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. 3:17And now, brethren, I know that in 
ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. 3:18But the things 
which God foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should 
suffer, he thus fulfilled. 3:19Repent ye therefore, and turn again, 
that your sins may be blotted out, that so there may come seasons of refreshing 
from the presence of the Lord; 3:20and that he may send the Christ who 
hath been appointed for you, even Jesus: 3:21whom the heaven 
must receive until the times of restoration of all things, whereof God spake by 
the mouth of His holy prophets that have been from of old. 3:22Moses indeed said, 
A prophet shall the Lord God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like 
unto me. To him shall ye hearken in all things whatsoever he shall speak unto 
you. 3:23And it shall be, that every soul that 
shall not hearken to that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the 
people. 3:24Yea and all the prophets from Samuel 
and them that followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these 
days. 3:25Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of 
the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy 
seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 3:26Unto you first God, 
having raised up his Servant, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one 
of you from your iniquities. 


4:1And as they spake unto the people, the 
priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, 4:2being sore troubled because they taught 
the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 4:3And 
they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now 
eventide. 4:4But many of them that heard the word 
believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand. 4:5And 
it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were 
gathered together in Jerusalem; 4:6and Annas the high priest was 
there, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the 
kindred of the high priest. 4:7And when they had set them in the midst, 
they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this? 4:8Then 
Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and 
elders, 4:9if we this day are examined concerning a 
good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole; 4:10be 
it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of 
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, 
even in him doth this man stand here before you whole. 4:11He 
is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the 
head of the corner. 4:12And in none other is there salvation: 
for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, 
wherein we must be saved. 4:13Now when they beheld the boldness of 
Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, 
they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. 
4:14And seeing the man that was healed 
standing with them, they could say nothing against it. 4:15But when they had 
commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, 
4:16saying, What shall we do to these men? 
for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to 
all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. 4:17But that it spread 
no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to 
no man in this name. 4:18And they called them, and charged them 
not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 4:19But Peter and John 
answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken 
unto you rather than unto God, judge ye: 4:20for we cannot but speak the things 
which we saw and heard. 4:21And they, when they had further 
threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, 
because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done. 4:22For the man was more than forty years 
old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought. 4:23And being let go, 
they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the 
elders had said unto them. 4:24And they, when they heard it, lifted up 
their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the 
heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: 4:25who by the Holy 
Spirit, by the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say, 
 Why did the Gentiles rage, 
 And the peoples imagine vain things? 
 4:26The kings of the earth set themselves 
in array, 
 And the rulers were gathered together, 
 Against the Lord, and against his Anointed: 
4:27for of a truth in this city against thy 
holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with 
the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together, 4:28to 
do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass. 4:29And now, Lord, look upon their 
threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness, 
4:30while thy stretchest forth thy hand to 
heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy 
Servant Jesus. 4:31And when they had prayed, the place was 
shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the 
Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness. 4:32And the multitude 
of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one of them 
said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all 
things common. 4:33And with great power gave the apostles 
their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon 
them all. 4:34For neither was there among them any 
that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and 
brought the prices of the things that were sold, 4:35and laid them at 
the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one 
had need. 4:36And Joseph, who by the apostles was 
surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a 
man of Cyprus by race, 4:37having a field, sold it, and brought 
the money and laid it at the apostles' feet. 


5:1But a certain man named Ananias, with 
Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, 5:2and kept back part of the price, 
his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the 
apostles' feet. 5:3But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan 
filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the 
price of the land? 5:4While it remained, did it not remain 
thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power? How is it that thou 
hast conceived this thing in thy heart? thou has not lied unto men, but unto 
God. 5:5And Ananias hearing these words fell 
down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came upon all that heard it. 5:6And 
the young men arose and wrapped him round, and they carried him out and buried 
him. 5:7And it was about the space of three 
hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. 5:8And 
Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she 
said, Yea, for so much. 5:9But Peter said unto her, How is 
it that ye have agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet 
of them that have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee 
out. 5:10And she fell down immediately at his 
feet, and gave up the ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead, and 
they carried her out and buried her by her husband. 5:11And great fear came 
upon the whole church, and upon all that heard these things. 5:12And by the hands of 
the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they were 
all with one accord in Solomon's porch. 5:13But of the rest durst no man join 
himself to them: howbeit the people magnified them; 5:14and believers were 
the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of them and women; 5:15insomuch that they even carried out the 
sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that, as Peter came 
by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them. 5:16And there also came together the 
multitudes from the cities round about Jerusalem, bring sick folk, and them that 
were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one. 5:17But the high priest rose up, and all 
they that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were 
filled with jealousy, 5:18and laid hands on the apostles, and put 
them in public ward. 5:19But an angel of the Lord by night 
opened the prison doors, and brought them out, and said, 5:20Go ye, and stand 
and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life. 5:21And when they heard this, they 
entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, 
and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate 
of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison-house to have them brought. 5:22But the officers that came found them 
not in the prison; and they returned, and told, 5:23saying, The 
prison-house we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors: 
but when we had opened, we found no man within. 5:24Now when the 
captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much 
perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow. 5:25And there came one 
and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple 
standing and teaching the people. 5:26Then went the captain with the 
officers, and brought them, but without violence; for they feared the 
people, lest they should be stoned. 5:27And when they had brought them, they 
set them before the council. And the high priest asked them, 5:28saying, We strictly 
charged you not to teach in this name: and behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with 
your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. 5:29But Peter and the 
apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men. 5:30The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, 
whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree. 5:31Him did God exalt with his right hand 
to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission 
of sins. 5:32And we are witnesses of these things; 
and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him. 5:33But they, when they heard this, were 
cut to the heart, and minded to slay them. 5:34But there stood up 
one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in 
honor of all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while. 5:35And he said unto them, Ye men of 
Israel, take heed to yourselves as touching these men, what ye are about to do. 
5:36For before these days rose up Theudas, 
giving himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, 
joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were 
dispersed, and came to nought. 5:37After this man rose up Judas of Galilee 
in the days of the enrolment, and drew away some of the people after him: 
he also perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad. 5:38And now I say unto you, Refrain from 
these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it 
will be overthrown: 5:39but if it is of God, ye will not be 
able to overthrow them; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against God. 
5:40And to him they agreed: and when they 
had called the apostles unto them, they beat them and charged them not to speak 
in the name of Jesus, and let them go. 5:41They therefore departed from the 
presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer 
dishonor for the Name. 5:42And every day, in the temple and at 
home, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus as the Christ. 

6:1Now in these days, when the number of 
the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews 
against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily 
ministration. 6:2And the twelve called the multitude of 
the disciples unto them, and said, It is not fit that we should forsake the word 
of God, and serve tables. 6:3Look ye out therefore, brethren, from 
among you seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we 
may appoint over this business. 6:4But we will continue stedfastly in 
prayer, and in the ministry of the word. 6:5And the saying pleased the whole 
multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, 
and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a 
proselyte of Antioch; 6:6whom they set before the apostles: and 
when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them. 6:7And the word of God 
increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; 
and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. 6:8And 
Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the 
people. 6:9But there arose certain of them that 
were of the synagogue called the synagogue of the Libertines, and of the 
Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing 
with Stephen. 6:10And they were not able to withstand the 
wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake. 6:11Then they suborned men, who said, We 
have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. 6:12And they stirred up the people, and the 
elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into 
the council, 6:13and set up false witnesses, who said, 
This man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place, and the law: 6:14for we have heard him say, that this 
Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which 
Moses delivered unto us. 6:15And all that sat in the council, 
fastening their eyes on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. 

7:1And the high priest said, Are these 
things so? 7:2And he said, Brethren and fathers, 
hearken: The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in 
Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, 7:3and said unto him, Get thee out of thy 
land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee. 7:4Then 
came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, 
when his father was dead, God removed him into this land, wherein ye now 
dwell: 7:5and he gave him none inheritance in it, 
no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to 
him in possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no 
child. 7:6And God spake on this wise, that his 
seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into 
bondage, and treat them ill, four hundred years. 7:7And the nation to 
which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they 
come forth, and serve me in this place. 7:8And he gave him the covenant of 
circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth 
day; and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs. 7:9And 
the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God 
was with him, 7:10and delivered him out of all his 
afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he 
made him governor over Egypt and all his house. 7:11Now there came a 
famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no 
sustenance. 7:12But when Jacob heard that there was 
grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time. 7:13And at the second 
time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's race became manifest 
unto Pharaoh. 7:14And Joseph sent, and called to him 
Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. 7:15And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he 
died, himself and our fathers; 7:16and they were carried over unto 
Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the 
sons of Hamor in Shechem. 7:17But as the time of the promise drew 
nigh which God vouchsafed unto Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 
7:18till there arose another king over 
Egypt, who knew not Joseph. 7:19The same dealt craftily with our race, 
and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babes to the end 
they might not live. 7:20At which season Moses was born, and was 
exceeding fair; and he was nourished three months in his father's house. 7:21and when he was cast out, Pharaoh's 
daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son. 7:22And Moses was 
instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words 
and works. 7:23But when he was well-nigh forty years 
old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel. 7:24And seeing one of them suffer 
wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, smiting the 
Egyptian: 7:25and he supposed that his brethren 
understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they understood 
not. 7:26And the day following he appeared unto 
them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are 
brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? 7:27But he that did his 
neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over 
us? 7:28Wouldest thou kill me, as thou killedst 
the Egyptian yesterday? 7:29And Moses fled at this saying, and 
became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons. 7:30And when forty years were fulfilled, an 
angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a 
bush. 7:31And when Moses saw it, he wondered at 
the sight: and as he drew near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord, 7:32I 
am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And 
Moses trembled, and durst not behold. 7:33And the Lord said unto him, Loose the 
shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 7:34I 
have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard 
their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send 
thee into Egypt. 7:35This Moses whom they refused, saying, 
Who made thee a ruler and a judge? him hath God sent to be both a ruler 
and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush. 7:36This man led them forth, having wrought 
wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty 
years. 7:37This is that Moses, who said unto the 
children of Israel, A prophet shall God raise up unto you from among your 
brethren, like unto me. 7:38This is he that was in the church in 
the wilderness with the angel that spake to him in the Mount Sinai, and with our 
fathers: who received living oracles to give unto us: 7:39to whom our fathers 
would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts 
unto Egypt, 7:40saying unto Aaron, Make us gods that 
shall go before us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of 
Egypt, we know not what is become of him. 7:41And they made a 
calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the 
works of their hands. 7:42But God turned, and gave them up to 
serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, 
 Did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices 
 Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel? 
 7:43And ye took up the tabernacle of 
Moloch, 
 And the star of the god Rephan, 
 The figures which ye made to worship them: 
 And I will carry you away beyond Babylon. 
7:44Our fathers had the tabernacle of the 
testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spake unto Moses, that he 
should make it according to the figure that he had seen. 7:45Which also our 
fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the 
possession of the nations, that God thrust out before the face of our fathers, 
unto the days of David; 7:46who found favor in the sight of God, 
and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob. 7:47But Solomon built 
him a house. 7:48Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in 
houses made with hands; as saith the prophet, 
 7:49The heaven is my throne, 
 And the earth the footstool of my feet: 
 What manner of house will ye build me? saith the Lord: 
 Or what is the place of my rest? 
 7:50Did not my hand make all these things? 
7:51Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in 
heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do 
ye. 7:52Which of the prophets did not your 
fathers persecute? and they killed them that showed before of the coming of the 
Righteous One; of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers; 7:53ye 
who received the law as it was ordained by angels, and kept it not. 7:54Now when they heard these things, they 
were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth. 7:55But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, 
looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing 
on the right hand of God, 7:56and said, Behold, I see the heavens 
opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God. 7:57But they cried out with a loud voice, 
and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord; 7:58and they cast him 
out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at 
the feet of a young man named Saul. 7:59And they stoned Stephen, calling upon 
the Lord, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. 7:60And he kneeled 
down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And 
when he had said this, he fell asleep. 

8:1And Saul was consenting unto his death. 
And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in 
Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea 
and Samaria, except the apostles. 8:2And devout men buried Stephen, and made 
great lamentation over him. 8:3But Saul laid waste the church, entering 
into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison. 8:4They 
therefore that were scattered abroad, went about preaching the word. 8:5And 
Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ. 8:6And 
the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by 
Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did. 8:7For from many 
of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and 
many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed. 8:8And there was much 
joy in that city. 8:9But there was a certain man, Simon by 
name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, 
giving out that himself was some great one: 8:10to whom they all 
gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God 
which is called Great. 8:11And they gave heed to him, because that 
of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries. 8:12But when they 
believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the 
name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 8:13And Simon also himself believed: and 
being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles 
wrought, he was amazed. 8:14Now when the apostles that were at 
Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them 
Peter and John: 8:15who, when they were come down, prayed 
for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit: 8:16for as yet it was 
fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord 
Jesus. 8:17Then laid they their hands on them, and 
they received the Holy Spirit. 8:18Now when Simon saw that through the 
laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them 
money, 8:19saying, Give me also this power, that 
on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit. 8:20But Peter said unto him, Thy silver 
perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with 
money. 8:21Thou hast neither part nor lot in this 
matter: for thy heart is not right before God. 8:22Repent therefore of 
this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart 
shall be forgiven thee. 8:23For I see that thou art in the gall of 
bitterness and in the bond of iniquity. 8:24And Simon answered and said, Pray ye 
for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me. 
8:25They therefore, when they had testified 
and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel 
to many villages of the Samaritans. 8:26But an angel of the Lord spake unto 
Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from 
Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert. 8:27And he arose and went: and behold, a 
man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the 
Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship; 
8:28and he was returning and sitting in his 
chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah. 8:29And the Spirit said 
unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. 8:30And Philip ran to 
him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what 
thou readest? 8:31And he said, How can I, except some one 
shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him. 8:32Now the passage of the Scripture which 
he was reading was this, 
 He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; 
 And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, 
 So he openeth not his mouth: 
 8:33In his humiliation his judgment was 
taken away: 
 His generation who shall declare? 
 For his life is taken from the earth. 
8:34And the eunuch answered Philip, and 
said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some 
other? 8:35And Philip opened his mouth, and 
beginning from this Scripture, preached unto him Jesus. 8:36And as they went on 
the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, here 
is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? 8:37And Philip said, 
If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I 
believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 8:38And he commanded 
the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip 
and the eunuch, and he baptized him. 8:39And when they came up out of the water, 
the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for 
he went on his way rejoicing. 8:40But Philip was found at Azotus: and 
passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to 
Caesarea. 

9:1But Saul, yet breathing threatening and 
slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, 9:2and 
asked of him letters to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he found any that 
were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 
9:3And as he journeyed, it came to pass 
that he drew nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him a 
light out of heaven: 9:4and he fell upon the earth, and heard a 
voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 9:5And he said, Who art 
thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: 9:6but 
rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. 9:7And 
the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but 
beholding no man. 9:8And Saul arose from the earth; and when 
his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought 
him into Damascus. 9:9And he was three days without sight, and 
did neither eat nor drink. 9:10Now there was a certain disciple at 
Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said unto him in a vision, Ananias. And he 
said, Behold, I am here, Lord. 9:11And the Lord said unto him, 
Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house 
of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth; 9:12and he hath seen a man named Ananias 
coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight. 9:13But Ananias answered, Lord, I have 
heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem: 9:14and here he hath authority from the 
chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name. 9:15But the Lord said 
unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before 
the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel: 9:16for I will show him 
how many things he must suffer for my name's sake. 9:17And Ananias 
departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother 
Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way which thou 
camest, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the 
Holy Spirit. 9:18And straightway there fell from his 
eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was 
baptized; 9:19and he took food and was strengthened. 
And he was certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus. 9:20And straightway in the synagogues he 
proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God. 9:21And all that heard 
him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that in Jerusalem made havoc of them 
that called on this name? and he had come hither for this intent, that he might 
bring them bound before the chief priests. 9:22But Saul increased 
the more in strength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, proving 
that this is the Christ. 9:23And when many days were fulfilled, the 
Jews took counsel together to kill him: 9:24but their plot became known to Saul. 
And they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him: 9:25but his disciples took him by night, 
and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket. 9:26And when he was 
come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: and they were 
all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. 9:27But Barnabas took 
him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the 
Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had 
preached boldly in the name of Jesus. 9:28And he was with them going in and going 
out at Jerusalem, 9:29preaching boldly in the name of the 
Lord: and he spake and disputed against the Grecian Jews; but they were seeking 
to kill him. 9:30And when the brethren knew it, they 
brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. 9:31So the church 
throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified; and, 
walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was 
multiplied. 9:32And it came to pass, as Peter went 
throughout all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda. 9:33And there he found a certain man named 
Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years; for he was palsied. 9:34And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus 
Christ healeth thee: arise and make thy bed. And straightway he arose. 9:35And all that dwelt at Lydda and in 
Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord. 9:36Now there was at 
Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called 
Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. 9:37And it came to pass in those days, that 
she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper 
chamber. 9:38And as Lydda was nigh unto Joppa, the 
disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men unto him, entreating him, 
Delay not to come on unto us. 9:39And Peter arose and went with them. And 
when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows 
stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, 
while she was with them. 9:40But Peter put them all forth, and 
kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And 
she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 9:41And he gave her his 
hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her 
alive. 9:42And it became known throughout all 
Joppa: and many believed on the Lord. 9:43And it came to pass, that he abode many 
days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner. 

10:1Now there was a certain man in 
Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the band called the Italian 
band, 10:2a devout man, and one that feared God 
with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always. 
10:3He saw in a vision openly, as it were 
about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying 
to him, Cornelius. 10:4And he, fastening his eyes upon him, 
and being affrighted, said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers 
and thine alms are gone up for a memorial before God. 10:5And now send men to 
Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter: 10:6he lodgeth with one 
Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side. 10:7And when the angel 
that spake unto him was departed, he called two of his household-servants, and a 
devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; 10:8and having 
rehearsed all things unto them, he sent them to Joppa. 10:9Now on the morrow, 
as they were on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon 
the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour: 10:10and he became 
hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance; 10:11and he beholdeth the heaven opened, 
and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four 
corners upon the earth: 10:12wherein were all manner of fourfooted 
beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven. 10:13And there came a voice to him, Rise, 
Peter; kill and eat. 10:14But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I 
have never eaten anything that is common and unclean. 10:15And a voice 
came unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, make not 
thou common. 10:16And this was done thrice: and 
straightway the vessel was received up into heaven. 10:17Now while Peter 
was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, 
behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's 
house, stood before the gate, 10:18and called and asked whether Simon, 
who was surnamed Peter, were lodging there. 10:19And while Peter 
thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. 10:20But arise, and get thee down, and go 
with them, nothing doubting: for I have sent them. 10:21And Peter went 
down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause 
wherefore ye are come? 10:22And they said, Cornelius a centurion, 
a righteous man and one that feareth God, and well reported of by all the nation 
of the Jews, was warned of God by a holy angel to send for thee into his 
house, and to hear words from thee. 10:23So he called them in and lodged them. 
And on the morrow he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren 
from Joppa accompanied him. 10:24And on the morrow they entered into 
Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen 
and his near friends. 10:25And when it came to pass that Peter 
entered, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. 10:26But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand 
up; I myself also am a man. 10:27And as he talked with him, he went in, 
and findeth many come together: 10:28and he said unto them, Ye yourselves 
know how it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to join himself or come 
unto one of another nation; and yet unto me hath God showed that I should 
not call any man common or unclean: 10:29wherefore also I came without 
gainsaying, when I was sent for. I ask therefore with what intent ye sent for 
me. 10:30And Cornelius said, Four days ago, 
until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, 
a man stood before me in bright apparel, 10:31and saith, 
Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the 
sight of God. 10:32Send therefore to Joppa, and call unto 
thee Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by 
the sea side. 10:33Forthwith therefore I sent to thee; 
and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore we are all here 
present in the sight of God, to hear all things that have been commanded thee of 
the Lord. 10:34And Peter opened his mouth and said, 
Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: 10:35but in every 
nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him. 10:36The word which he sent unto the 
children of Israel, preaching good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ (He is Lord 
of all.) -- 10:37that saying ye yourselves know, which 
was published throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism 
which John preached; 10:38even Jesus of Nazareth, how God 
anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and 
healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. 10:39And we are witnesses of all things 
which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they 
slew, hanging him on a tree. 10:40Him God raised up the third day, and 
gave him to be made manifest, 10:41not to all the people, but unto 
witnesses that were chosen before of God, even to us, who ate and drank 
with him after he rose from the dead. 10:42And he charged us to preach unto the 
people, and to testify that this is he who is ordained of God to be the 
Judge of the living and the dead. 10:43To him bear all the prophets witness, 
that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of 
sins. 10:44While Peter yet spake these words, the 
Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word. 10:45And they of the 
circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that 
on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit. 10:46For they heard them speak with 
tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, 10:47Can any man forbid 
the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit 
as well as we? 10:48And he commanded them to be baptized 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days. 

11:1Now the apostles and the brethren that 
were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 11:2And when Peter was come up to 
Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, 11:3saying, Thou wentest in to men 
uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. 11:4But Peter began, and expounded the 
matter unto them in order, saying, 11:5I was in the city of Joppa praying: and 
in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great 
sheet let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even unto me: 11:6upon which when I had fastened mine 
eyes, I considered, and saw the fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts 
and creeping things and birds of the heaven. 11:7And I heard also a 
voice saying unto me, Rise, Peter; kill and eat. 11:8But I said, Not so, 
Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth. 11:9But a voice answered the second time 
out of heaven, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common. 11:10And this was done thrice: and all were 
drawn up again into heaven. 11:11And behold, forthwith three men stood 
before the house in which we were, having been sent from Caesarea unto me. 11:12And the Spirit bade me go with them, 
making no distinction. And these six brethren also accompanied me; and we 
entered into the man's house: 11:13and he told us how he had seen the 
angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose 
surname is Peter; 11:14who shall speak unto thee words, 
whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house. 11:15And as I began to 
speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning. 11:16And I remembered the word of the Lord, 
how he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the 
Holy Spirit. 11:17If then God gave unto them the like 
gift as he did also unto us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, 
who was I, that I could withstand God? 11:18And when they heard these things, they 
held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also hath God 
granted repentance unto life. 11:19They therefore that were scattered 
abroad upon the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as 
Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none save only to Jews. 
11:20But there were some of them, men of 
Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks 
also, preaching the Lord Jesus. 11:21And the hand of the Lord was with 
them: and a great number that believed turned unto the Lord. 11:22And the report concerning them came to 
the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas as 
far as Antioch: 11:23who, when he was come, and had seen 
the grace of God, was glad; and he exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart 
they would cleave unto the Lord: 11:24for he was a good man, and full of the 
Holy Spirit and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. 11:25And he went forth to Tarsus to seek 
for Saul; 11:26and when he had found him, he brought 
him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that even for a whole year they were 
gathered together with the church, and taught much people, and that the 
disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. 11:27Now in these days 
there came down prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. 11:28And there stood up 
one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a 
great famine over all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius. 11:29And the disciples, every man according 
to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in Judea: 
11:30which also they did, sending it to the 
elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. 

12:1Now about that time Herod the king put 
forth his hands to afflict certain of the church. 12:2And he killed James 
the brother of John with the sword. 12:3And when he saw that it pleased the 
Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. And those were the days of 
unleavened bread. 12:4And when he had taken him, he put him 
in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; 
intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people. 12:5Peter therefore was kept in the prison: 
but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto God for him. 12:6And when Herod was about to bring him 
forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two 
chains: and guards before the door kept the prison. 12:7And behold, an 
angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he smote 
Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell 
off from his hands. 12:8And the angel said unto him, Gird 
thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto him, Cast thy 
garment about thee, and follow me. 12:9And he went out, and followed; and he 
knew not that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a 
vision. 12:10And when they were past the first and 
the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city; which 
opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one 
street; and straightway the angel departed from him. 12:11And when Peter was 
come to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth 
his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the 
expectation of the people of the Jews. 12:12And when he had considered the 
thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was 
Mark; where many were gathered together and were praying. 12:13And when he 
knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda. 12:14And when she knew Peter's voice, she 
opened not the gate for joy, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the 
gate. 12:15And they said unto her, Thou art mad. 
But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his 
angel. 12:16But Peter continued knocking: and when 
they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed. 12:17But he, beckoning 
unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had 
brought him forth out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things unto James, 
and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place. 12:18Now as soon as it was day, there was 
no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. 12:19And when Herod had 
sought for him, and found him not, he examined the guards, and commanded that 
they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and 
tarried there. 12:20Now he was highly displeased with them 
of Tyre and Sidon: and they came with one accord to him, and, having made 
Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their 
country was fed from the king's country. 12:21And upon a set day 
Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sat on the throne, and made an 
oration unto them. 12:22And the people shouted, saying, 
The voice of a god, and not of a man. 12:23And immediately an angel of the Lord 
smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and 
gave up the ghost. 12:24But the word of God grew and 
multiplied. 12:25And Barnabas and Saul returned from 
Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministration, taking with them John 
whose surname was Mark. 

13:1Now there were at Antioch, in the 
church that was there, prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon that 
was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod 
the tetrarch, and Saul. 13:2And as they ministered to the Lord, and 
fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work 
whereunto I have called them. 13:3Then, when they had fasted and prayed 
and laid their hands on them, they sent them away. 13:4So they, being sent 
forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to 
Cyprus. 13:5And when they were at Salamis, they 
proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John 
as their attendant. 13:6And when they had gone through the 
whole island unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, 
whose name was Bar-jesus; 13:7who was with the proconsul, Sergius 
Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul, and 
sought to hear the word of God. 13:8But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his 
name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from 
the faith. 13:9But Saul, who is also called 
Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him, 13:10and said, O full of all guile and all 
villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not 
cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? 13:11And now, behold, 
the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun 
for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he 
went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. 13:12Then the 
proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching 
of the Lord. 13:13Now Paul and his company set sail from 
Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned 
to Jerusalem. 13:14But they, passing through from Perga, 
came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, 
and sat down. 13:15And after the reading of the law and 
the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye 
have any word of exhortation for the people, say on. 13:16And Paul stood up, 
and beckoning with the hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken: 
13:17The God of this people Israel chose 
our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, 
and with a high arm led he them forth out of it. 13:18And for about the 
time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness. 13:19And when he had destroyed seven 
nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an 
inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years: 13:20and after these 
things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. 13:21And afterward they 
asked for a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the 
tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years. 13:22And when he had 
removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bare witness 
and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who shall 
do all My will. 13:23Of this man's seed hath God according 
to promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus; 13:24when John had 
first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of 
Israel. 13:25And as John was fulfilling his course, 
he said, What suppose ye that I am? I am not he. But behold, there cometh 
one after me the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose. 13:26Brethren, children of the stock of 
Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation 
sent forth. 13:27For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and 
their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which 
are read every sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him. 13:28And though they found no cause of 
death in him, yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain. 13:29And when they had fulfilled all things 
that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a 
tomb. 13:30But God raised him from the dead: 13:31and he was seen for many days of them 
that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses unto 
the people. 13:32And we bring you good tidings of the 
promise made unto the fathers, 13:33that God hath fulfilled the same unto 
our children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second 
psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. 13:34And as concerning 
that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he 
hath spoken on this wise, I will give you the holy and sure blessings of 
David. 13:35Because he saith also in another 
psalm, Thou wilt not give Thy Holy One to see corruption. 13:36For David, after he had in his own 
generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid unto his 
fathers, and saw corruption: 13:37but he whom God raised up saw no 
corruption. 13:38Be it known unto you therefore, 
brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins: 13:39and by him every one that believeth is 
justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of 
Moses. 13:40Beware therefore, lest that come upon 
you which is spoken in the prophets: 
 13:41Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and 
perish; 
 For I work a work in your days, 
 A work which ye shall in no wise believe, if one declare it unto you. 
13:42And as they went out, they besought 
that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath. 13:43Now when the 
synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul 
and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God. 
13:44And the next sabbath almost the whole 
city was gathered together to hear the word of God. 13:45But when the Jews 
saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things 
which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed. 13:46And Paul and 
Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God 
should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge 
yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. 13:47For so hath the Lord commanded us, 
saying, 
 I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, 
 That thou shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the 
earth. 
13:48And as the Gentiles heard this, they 
were glad, and glorified the word of God: and as many as were ordained to 
eternal life believed. 13:49And the word of the Lord was spread 
abroad throughout all the region. 13:50But the Jews urged on the devout women 
of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution 
against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders. 13:51But they shook off the dust of their 
feet against them, and came unto Iconium. 13:52And the disciples 
were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit. 

14:1And it came to pass in Iconium that 
they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great 
multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed. 14:2But the Jews that 
were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil 
affected against the brethren. 14:3Long time therefore they tarried 
there speaking boldly in the Lord, who bare witness unto the word of his 
grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. 14:4But the multitude 
of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the 
apostles. 14:5And when there was made an onset both 
of the Gentiles and of the Jews with their rulers, to treat them shamefully and 
to stone them, 14:6they became aware of it, and fled unto 
the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region round about: 14:7and there they preached the gospel. 14:8And at Lystra there sat a certain man, 
impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked. 14:9The same heard Paul speaking, who, 
fastening eyes upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole, 14:10said with a loud voice, Stand upright 
on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked. 14:11And when the 
multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the 
speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. 14:12And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and 
Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker. 14:13And the priest of 
Jupiter whose temple was before the city, brought oxen and garlands unto 
the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes. 14:14But when the apostles, Barnabas and 
Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the 
multitude, crying out 14:15and saying, Sirs, why do ye these 
things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good tidings, 
that ye should turn from these vain things unto a living God, who made the 
heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: 14:16who in the 
generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways. 14:17And yet He left not himself without 
witness, in that he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful 
seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness. 14:18And with these 
sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them. 14:19But there came Jews thither from 
Antioch and Iconium: and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and 
dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. 14:20But as the 
disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and entered into the city: and on 
the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe. 14:21And when they had 
preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to 
Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch, 14:22confirming the souls of the disciples, 
exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations we 
must enter into the kingdom of God. 14:23And when they had appointed for them 
elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the 
Lord, on whom they had believed. 14:24And they passed through Pisidia, and 
came to Pamphylia. 14:25And when they had spoken the word in 
Perga, they went down to Attalia; 14:26and thence they sailed to Antioch, 
from whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they 
had fulfilled. 14:27And when they were come, and had 
gathered the church together, they rehearsed all things that God had done with 
them, and that he had opened a door of faith unto the Gentiles. 14:28And they tarried no little time with 
the disciples. 

15:1And certain men came down from Judaea 
and taught the brethren, saying, Except ye be circumcised after the 
custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved. 15:2And when Paul and Barnabas had no small 
dissension and questioning with them, the brethren appointed that Paul 
and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the 
apostles and elders about this question. 15:3They therefore, being brought on their 
way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the 
conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. 15:4And when they were come to Jerusalem, 
they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they 
rehearsed all things that God had done with them. 15:5But there rose up 
certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to 
circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses. 15:6And the apostles and the elders were 
gathered together to consider of this matter. 15:7And when there had 
been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that 
a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should 
hear the word of the gospel, and believe. 15:8And God, who 
knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he 
did unto us; 15:9and he made no distinction between us 
and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. 15:10Now therefore why 
make ye trial of God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples 
which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 15:11But we believe 
that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as 
they. 15:12And all the multitude kept silence; 
and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God 
had wrought among the Gentiles through them. 15:13And after they had 
held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me: 15:14Symeon hath rehearsed how first God 
visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. 15:15And to this agree the words of the 
prophets; as it is written, 
 15:16After these things I will return, 
 And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen; 
 And I will build again the ruins thereof, 
 And I will set it up: 
 15:17That the residue of men may seek after 
the Lord, 
 And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, 
 15:18Saith the Lord, who maketh these 
things known from of old. 
15:19Wherefore my judgment is, that we 
trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God; 15:20but that we write 
unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, 
and from what is strangled, and from blood. 15:21For Moses from 
generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the 
synagogues every sabbath. 15:22Then it seemed good to the apostles 
and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and 
send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas called 
Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: 15:23and they wrote 
thus by them, The apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren 
who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting: 15:24Forasmuch as we have heard that 
certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your 
souls; to whom we gave no commandment; 15:25it seemed good unto us, having come to 
one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas 
and Paul, 15:26men that have hazarded their lives for 
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 15:27We have sent therefore Judas and 
Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth. 15:28For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, 
and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: 15:29that ye abstain from things sacrificed 
to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from 
which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well. 15:30So they, when they were dismissed, 
came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered 
the epistle. 15:31And when they had read it, they 
rejoiced for the consolation. 15:32And Judas and Silas, being themselves 
also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. 15:33And after they had spent some time 
there, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had 
sent them forth. 15:34But it seemed good unto Silas to 
abide there. 15:35But Paul and Barnabas tarried in 
Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. 15:36And after some days Paul said unto 
Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we 
proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they fare. 15:37And Barnabas was minded to take with 
them John also, who was called Mark. 15:38But Paul thought not good to take with 
them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the 
work. 15:39And there arose a sharp contention, so 
that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, 
and sailed away unto Cyprus; 15:40but Paul choose Silas, and went forth, 
being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord. 15:41And he went 
through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches. 

16:1And he came also to Derbe and to 
Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a 
Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek. 16:2The same was well 
reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. 16:3Him would Paul have 
to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that 
were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek. 16:4And as they went on their way through 
the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of 
the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem. 16:5So the churches 
were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily. 16:6And they went through the region of 
Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word 
in Asia; 16:7and when they were come over against 
Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them 
not; 16:8and passing by Mysia, they came down to 
Troas. 16:9And a vision appeared to Paul in the 
night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come 
over into Macedonia, and help us. 16:10And when he had seen the vision, 
straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called 
us to preach the gospel to them. 16:11Setting sail therefore from Troas, we 
made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis; 16:12and from thence to Philippi, which is 
a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a Roman colony: and we 
were in this city tarrying certain days. 16:13And on the sabbath 
day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was 
a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come 
together. 16:14And a certain woman named Lydia, a 
seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: 
whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by 
Paul. 16:15And when she was baptized, and her 
household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the 
Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us. 16:16And it came to pass, as we were going 
to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met 
us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying. 16:17The same following 
after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High 
God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation. 16:18And this she did 
for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I 
charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that 
very hour. 16:19But when her masters saw that the hope 
of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into 
the marketplace before the rulers, 16:20and when they had brought them unto 
the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our 
city, 16:21and set forth customs which it is not 
lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans. 16:22And the multitude 
rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, 
and commanded to beat them with rods. 16:23And when they had laid many stripes 
upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: 
16:24who, having received such a charge, 
cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. 16:25But about midnight Paul and Silas were 
praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them; 16:26and suddenly there was a great 
earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and 
immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. 16:27And the jailor, being roused out of 
sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill 
himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. 16:28But Paul cried 
with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. 16:29And he called for lights and sprang 
in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas, 16:30and brought them out and said, Sirs, 
what must I do to be saved? 16:31And they said, Believe on the Lord 
Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house. 16:32And they spake the 
word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house. 16:33And he took them 
the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and 
all his, immediately. 16:34And he brought them up into his house, 
and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having 
believed in God. 16:35But when it was day, the magistrates 
sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go. 16:36And the jailor 
reported the words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent to let you 
go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace. 16:37But Paul said unto 
them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have 
cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? Nay verily; but let 
them come themselves and bring us out. 16:38And the sergeants reported these words 
unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans; 16:39and they came and besought them; and 
when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city. 16:40And they went out of the prison, and 
entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, 
they comforted them, and departed. 

17:1Now when they had passed through 
Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of 
the Jews: 17:2and Paul, as his custom was, went in 
unto them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures, 17:3opening and alleging that it behooved 
the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, 
whom, said he, I proclaim unto you, is the Christ. 17:4And some of them 
were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the devout Greeks a 
great multitude, and of the chief women not a few. 17:5But the Jews, being 
moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and 
gathering a crowd, set the city on an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, 
they sought to bring them forth to the people. 17:6And when they found 
them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, 
crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; 17:7whom Jason hath received: and these all 
act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, 
one Jesus. 17:8And they troubled the multitude and the 
rulers of the city, when they heard these things. 17:9And when they had 
taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go. 17:10And the brethren 
immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Beroea: who when they were 
come thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. 17:11Now these were 
more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all 
readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were 
so. 17:12Many of them therefore believed; also 
of the Greek women of honorable estate, and of men, not a few. 17:13But when the Jews of Thessalonica had 
knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed of Paul at Beroea also, they came 
thither likewise, stirring up and troubling the multitudes. 17:14And then 
immediately the brethren sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea: and Silas 
and Timothy abode there still. 17:15But they that conducted Paul brought 
him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy that 
they should come to him with all speed, they departed. 17:16Now while Paul 
waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the 
city full of idols. 17:17So he reasoned in the synagogue with 
Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with them that met 
him. 17:18And certain also of the Epicurean and 
Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What would this babbler say? 
others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached 
Jesus and the resurrection. 17:19And they took hold of him, and brought 
him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is 
spoken by thee? 17:20For thou bringest certain strange 
things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean. 17:21(Now all the Athenians and the 
strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell 
or to hear some new thing.) 17:22And Paul stood in the midst of the 
Areopagus, and said, Ye men of Athens, in all things, I perceive that ye are 
very religious. 17:23For as I passed along, and observed 
the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN 
UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you. 
17:24The God that made the world and all 
things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made 
with hands; 17:25neither is he served by men's hands, 
as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, 
and all things; 17:26and he made of one every nation of men 
to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed 
seasons, and the bounds of their habitation; 17:27that they should 
seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far 
from each one of us: 17:28for in him we live, and move, and have 
our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, For we are also his 
offspring. 17:29Being then the offspring of God, we 
ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, 
graven by art and device of man. 17:30The times of ignorance therefore God 
overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent: 17:31inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in 
which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; 
whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from 
the dead. 17:32Now when they heard of the 
resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee 
concerning this yet again. 17:33Thus Paul went out from among them. 17:34But certain men clave unto him, and 
believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named 
Damaris, and others with them. 

18:1After these things he departed from 
Athens, and came to Corinth. 18:2And he found a certain Jew named 
Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife 
Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and 
he came unto them; 18:3and because he was of the same trade, 
he abode with them, and they wrought, for by their trade they were tentmakers. 
18:4And he reasoned in the synagogue every 
sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks. 18:5But when Silas and Timothy came down 
from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, testifying to the Jews that 
Jesus was the Christ. 18:6And when they opposed themselves and 
blasphemed, he shook out his raiment and said unto them, Your blood be 
upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. 18:7And he departed thence, and went into 
the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose 
house joined hard to the synagogue. 18:8And Crispus, the ruler of the 
synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians 
hearing believed, and were baptized. 18:9And the Lord said unto Paul in the 
night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy peace: 18:10for I am with thee, and no man shall 
set on thee to harm thee: for I have much people in this city. 18:11And he dwelt there a year and 
six months, teaching the word of God among them. 18:12But when Gallio 
was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and 
brought him before the judgment-seat, 18:13saying, This man persuadeth men to 
worship God contrary to the law. 18:14But when Paul was about to open his 
mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of 
wicked villany, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: 18:15but if they are questions about words 
and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; I am not minded to be a judge 
of these matters. 18:16And he drove them from the 
judgment-seat. 18:17And they all laid hold on Sosthenes, 
the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio 
cared for none of these things. 18:18And Paul, having tarried after this 
yet many days, took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence for Syria, and 
with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchreae; for he had a 
vow. 18:19And they came to Ephesus, and he left 
them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the 
Jews. 18:20And when they asked him to abide a 
longer time, he consented not; 18:21but taking his leave of them, and 
saying, I will return again unto you if God will, he set sail from Ephesus. 18:22And when he had landed at Caesarea, he 
went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch. 18:23And having spent 
some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and 
Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples. 18:24Now a certain Jew 
named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he 
was mighty in the scriptures. 18:25This man had been instructed in the 
way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately the 
things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John: 18:26and he began to 
speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they 
took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately. 18:27And when he was minded to pass over 
into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive 
him: and when he was come, he helped them much that had believed through grace; 
18:28for he powerfully confuted the Jews, 
and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ. 

19:1And it came to pass, that, while 
Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to 
Ephesus, and found certain disciples: 19:2and he said unto them, Did ye receive 
the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they said unto him, Nay, we did not 
so much as hear whether the Holy Spirit was given. 19:3And he said, Into 
what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism. 19:4And Paul said, John baptized with the 
baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him 
that should come after him, that is, on Jesus. 19:5And when they heard 
this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. 19:6And when Paul had 
laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spake with 
tongues, and prophesied. 19:7And they were in all about twelve men. 
19:8And he entered into the synagogue, and 
spake boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading as 
to the things concerning the kingdom of God. 19:9But when some were 
hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he 
departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school 
of Tyrannus. 19:10And this continued for the space of 
two years; so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both 
Jews and Greeks. 19:11And God wrought special miracles by 
the hands of Paul: 19:12insomuch that unto the sick were 
carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the evil spirits went 
out. 19:13But certain also of the strolling 
Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the 
name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. 19:14And there were seven sons of one 
Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this. 19:15And the evil 
spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are 
ye? 19:16And the man in whom the evil spirit 
was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so 
that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 19:17And this became 
known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon 
them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. 19:18Many also of them 
that had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds. 19:19And not a few of them that practised 
magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; 
and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of 
silver. 19:20So mightily grew the word of the Lord 
and prevailed. 19:21Now after these things were ended, 
Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to 
go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. 19:22And having sent into Macedonia two of 
them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia 
for a while. 19:23And about that time there arose no 
small stir concerning the Way. 19:24For a certain man named Demetrius, a 
silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought no little business unto 
the craftsmen; 19:25whom he gathered together, with the 
workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business we 
have our wealth. 19:26And ye see and hear, that not alone at 
Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned 
away much people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands: 19:27and not only is there danger that this 
our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess 
Diana be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her 
magnificence whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. 19:28And when they 
heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of 
the Ephesus. 19:29And the city was filled with the 
confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius 
and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel. 19:30And when Paul was minded to enter in 
unto the people, the disciples suffered him not. 19:31And certain also 
of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent unto him and besought him not to 
adventure himself into the theatre. 19:32Some therefore cried one thing, and 
some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and the more part knew not 
wherefore they were come together. 19:33And they brought Alexander out of the 
multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, 
and would have made a defense unto the people. 19:34But when they 
perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours 
cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. 19:35And when the 
townclerk had quieted the multitude, he saith, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is 
there who knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the 
great Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter? 19:36Seeing then that these things cannot 
be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash. 19:37For ye have 
brought hither these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor 
blasphemers of our goddess. 19:38If therefore Demetrius, and the 
craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, 
and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another. 19:39But if ye seek 
anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly. 19:40For indeed we are in danger to be 
accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause for it: and as 
touching it we shall not be able to give account of this concourse. 19:41And when he had thus spoken, he 
dismissed the assembly. 

20:1And after the uproar ceased, Paul 
having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, took leave of them, and 
departed to go into Macedonia. 20:2And when he had gone through those 
parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece. 20:3And when he had spent three months 
there, and a plot was laid against him by Jews as he was about to set 
sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia. 20:4And there 
accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater of Beroea, the son of Pyrrhus; 
and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and 
Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. 20:5But these had gone 
before, and were waiting for us at Troas. 20:6And we sailed away 
from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in 
five days, where we tarried seven days. 20:7And upon the first day of the week, 
when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, 
intending to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until midnight. 20:8And there were many lights in the upper 
chamber where we were gathered together. 20:9And there sat in the window a certain 
young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet 
longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was 
taken up dead. 20:10And Paul went down, and fell on him, 
and embracing him said, Make ye no ado; for his life is in him. 20:11And when he was gone up, and had 
broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even till 
break of day, so he departed. 20:12And they brought the lad alive, and 
were not a little comforted. 20:13But we going before to the ship set 
sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, 
intending himself to go by land. 20:14And when he met us at Assos, we took 
him in, and came to Mitylene. 20:15And sailing from thence, we came the 
following day over against Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the 
day after we came to Miletus. 20:16For Paul had determined to sail past 
Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if 
it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. 20:17And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, 
and called to him the elders of the church. 20:18And when they were 
come to him, he said unto them, Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I 
set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you all the time, 20:19serving the Lord with all lowliness of 
mind, and with tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews; 
20:20how I shrank not from declaring unto 
you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly, and from house to 
house, 20:21testifying both to Jews and to Greeks 
repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 20:22And now, behold, I go bound in the 
spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: 20:23save that the Holy Spirit testifieth 
unto me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. 20:24But I hold not my life of any account 
as dear unto myself, so that I may accomplish my course, and the ministry which 
I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. 20:25And now, behold, I know that ye all, 
among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, shall see my face no more. 20:26Wherefore I testify unto you this day, 
that I am pure from the blood of all men. 20:27For I shrank not 
from declaring unto you the whole counsel of God. 20:28Take heed unto 
yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit hath made you 
bishops, to feed the church of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood. 
20:29I know that after my departing 
grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock; 20:30and from among your own selves shall 
men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. 20:31Wherefore watch ye, remembering that 
by the space of three years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day 
with tears. 20:32And now I commend you to God, and to 
the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give 
you the inheritance among all them that are sanctified. 20:33I coveted no man's silver, or gold, or 
apparel. 20:34Ye yourselves know that these hands 
ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. 20:35In all things I gave you an example, 
that so laboring ye ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the 
Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. 20:36And when he had thus spoken, he 
kneeled down and prayed with them all. 20:37And they all wept sore, and fell on 
Paul's neck and kissed him, 20:38sorrowing most of all for the word 
which he had spoken, that they should behold his face no more. And they brought 
him on his way unto the ship. 

21:1And when it came to pass that were 
parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and 
the next day unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: 21:2and having found a 
ship crossing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail. 21:3And when we had come in sight of 
Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre; 
for there the ship was to unlade her burden. 21:4And having found 
the disciples, we tarried there seven days: and these said to Paul through the 
Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem. 21:5And when it came to 
pass that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey; and 
they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were out of the 
city: and kneeling down on the beach, we prayed, and bade each other farewell; 
21:6and we went on board the ship, but they 
returned home again. 21:7And when we had finished the voyage 
from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we saluted the brethren, and abode with 
them one day. 21:8And on the morrow we departed, and came 
unto Caesarea: and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one 
of the seven, we abode with him. 21:9Now this man had four virgin daughters, 
who prophesied. 21:10And as we tarried there some days, 
there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus. 21:11And coming to us, and taking Paul's 
girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, 
So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall 
deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. 21:12And when we heard 
these things, both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to 
Jerusalem. 21:13Then Paul answered, What do ye, 
weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to 
die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. 21:14And when he would 
not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done. 21:15And after these days we took up our 
baggage and went up to Jerusalem. 21:16And there went with us also 
certain of the disciples from Caesarea, bringing with them one 
Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge. 21:17And when we were come to Jerusalem, 
the brethren received us gladly. 21:18And the day following Paul went in 
with us unto James; and all the elders were present. 21:19And when he had 
saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had wrought among the 
Gentiles through his ministry. 21:20And they, when they heard it, 
glorified God; and they said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands 
there are among the Jews of them that have believed; and they are all zealous 
for the law: 21:21and they have been informed concerning 
thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake 
Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the 
customs. 21:22What is it therefore? They will 
certainly hear that thou art come. 21:23Do therefore this that we say to thee: 
We have four men that have a vow on them; 21:24these take, and 
purify thyself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their 
heads: and all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have 
been informed concerning thee; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, 
keeping the law. 21:25But as touching the Gentiles that have 
believed, we wrote, giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things 
sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from 
fornication. 21:26Then Paul took the men, and the next 
day purifying himself with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfilment 
of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of 
them. 21:27And when the seven days were almost 
completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all 
the multitude and laid hands on him, 21:28crying out, Men of Israel, help: This 
is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and 
this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath 
defiled this holy place. 21:29For they had before seen with him in 
the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into 
the temple. 21:30And all the city was moved, and the 
people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the 
temple: and straightway the doors were shut. 21:31And as they were 
seeking to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all 
Jerusalem was in confusion. 21:32And forthwith he took soldiers and 
centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief captain 
and the soldiers, left off beating Paul. 21:33Then the chief 
captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two 
chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done. 21:34And some shouted 
one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the 
certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle. 21:35And when he came upon the stairs, so 
it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd; 21:36for the multitude of the people 
followed after, crying out, Away with him. 21:37And as Paul was 
about to be brought into the castle, he saith unto the chief captain, May I say 
something unto thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek? 21:38Art thou not then 
the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the 
wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins? 21:39But Paul said, I 
am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, 
give me leave to speak unto the people. 21:40And when he had given him leave, Paul, 
standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand unto the people; and when there 
was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, saying, 

22:1Brethren and fathers, hear ye the 
defence which I now make unto you. 22:2And when they heard that he spake unto 
them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet: and he saith, 22:3I 
am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of 
Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, 
being zealous for God, even as ye all are this day: 22:4and I persecuted 
this Way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. 
22:5As also the high priest doth bear me 
witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters 
unto the brethren, and journeyed to Damascus to bring them also that were there 
unto Jerusalem in bonds to be punished. 22:6And it came to pass, that, as I made my 
journey, and drew nigh unto Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from 
heaven a great light round about me. 22:7And I fell unto the ground, and heard a 
voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 22:8And I answered, Who 
art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou 
persecutest. 22:9And they that were with me beheld 
indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. 22:10And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And 
the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told 
thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. 22:11And when I could 
not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were 
with me I came into Damascus. 22:12And one Ananias, a devout man 
according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there, 22:13came unto me, and standing by me said 
unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And in that very hour I looked up on 
him. 22:14And he said, The God of our fathers 
hath appointed thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear 
a voice from his mouth. 22:15For thou shalt be a witness for him 
unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard. 22:16And now why 
tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his 
name. 22:17And it came to pass, that, when I had 
returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance, 
22:18and saw him saying unto me, Make 
haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive of 
thee testimony concerning me. 22:19And I said, Lord, they themselves know 
that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee: 22:20and when the blood of Stephen thy 
witness was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the 
garments of them that slew him. 22:21And he said unto me, Depart: for I 
will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles. 22:22And they gave him 
audience unto this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with 
such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live. 22:23And as they cried out, and threw off 
their garments, and cast dust into the air, 22:24the chief captain 
commanded him be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by 
scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him. 22:25And when they had tied him up with the 
thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to 
scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned? 22:26And when the 
centurion heard it, he went to the chief captain and told him, saying, What art 
thou about to do? for this man is a Roman. 22:27And the chief 
captain came and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yea. 22:28And the chief captain answered, With a 
great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am a Roman 
born. 22:29They then that were about to examine 
him straightway departed from him: and the chief captain also was afraid when he 
knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. 22:30But on the morrow, 
desiring to know the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed 
him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and 
brought Paul down and set him before them. 

23:1And Paul, looking stedfastly on the 
council, said, Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience until 
this day. 23:2And the high priest Ananias commanded 
them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. 23:3Then said Paul unto 
him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: and sittest thou to judge me 
according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? 23:4And they that stood by said, Revilest 
thou God's high priest? 23:5And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, 
that he was high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler 
of thy people. 23:6But when Paul perceived that the one 
part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, 
Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: touching the hope and 
resurrection of the dead I am called in question. 23:7And when he had so 
said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the 
assembly was divided. 23:8For the Sadducees say that there is no 
resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both. 23:9And there arose a great clamor: and 
some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and strove, saying, We find 
no evil in this man: and what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel? 23:10And when there arose a great 
dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by 
them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, 
and bring him into the castle. 23:11And the night following the Lord stood 
by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at 
Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome. 23:12And when it was 
day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that 
they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. 23:13And they were more 
than forty that made this conspiracy. 23:14And they came to the chief priests and 
the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste 
nothing until we have killed Paul. 23:15Now therefore do ye with the council 
signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would 
judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay 
him. 23:16But Paul's sister's son heard of their 
lying in wait, and he came and entered into the castle and told Paul. 23:17And Paul called unto him one of the 
centurions, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain; for he hath 
something to tell him. 23:18So he took him, and brought him to the 
chief captain, and saith, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to 
bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say to thee. 23:19And the chief captain took him by the 
hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that thou hast to tell me? 
23:20And he said, The Jews have agreed to 
ask thee to bring down Paul tomorrow unto the council, as though thou wouldest 
inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him. 23:21Do not thou 
therefore yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty 
men, who have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink till 
they have slain him: and now are they ready, looking for the promise from thee. 
23:22So the chief captain let the young man 
go, charging him, Tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me. 23:23And he called unto him two of the 
centurions, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, 
and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of 
the night: 23:24and he bade them provide 
beasts, that they might set Paul thereon, and bring him safe unto Felix the 
governor. 23:25And he wrote a letter after this form: 
23:26Claudius Lysias unto the most 
excellent governor Felix, greeting. 23:27This man was seized by the Jews, and 
was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and 
rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman. 23:28And desiring to 
know the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him down unto their 
council: 23:29whom I found to be accused about 
questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death 
or of bonds. 23:30And when it was shown to me that there 
would be a plot against the man, I sent him to thee forthwith, charging his 
accusers also to speak against him before thee. 23:31So the soldiers, 
as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. 23:32But on the morrow they left the 
horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle: 23:33and they, when 
they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul 
also before him. 23:34And when he had read it, he asked of 
what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia, 23:35I will hear thee fully, said he, when 
thine accusers also are come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace. 


24:1And after five days the high priest 
Ananias came down with certain elders, and with an orator, one Tertullus; 
and they informed the governor against Paul. 24:2And when he was 
called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much 
peace, and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation, 24:3we 
accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all 
thankfulness. 24:4But, that I be not further tedious unto 
thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words. 24:5For we have found 
this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews 
throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: 24:6who moreover assayed to profane the 
temple: on whom also we laid hold: and we would have judged him according to 
our law. 24:7But the chief captain Lysias came, 
and with great violence took him away out of our hands, 24:8commanding his 
accusers to come before thee. from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him 
thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him. 24:9And the Jews also joined in the charge, 
affirming that these things were so. 24:10And when the governor had beckoned 
unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of 
many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defense: 24:11Seeing that thou canst take knowledge 
that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem: 24:12and neither in the temple did they 
find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, 
nor in the city. 24:13Neither can they prove to thee the 
things whereof they now accuse me. 24:14But this I confess unto thee, that 
after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, 
believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in 
the prophets; 24:15having hope toward God, which these 
also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just 
and unjust. 24:16Herein I also exercise myself to have 
a conscience void of offence toward God and men always. 24:17Now after some 
years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings: 24:18amidst which they 
found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but 
there were certain Jews from Asia-- 24:19who ought to have 
been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me. 24:20Or else let these men themselves say 
what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council, 24:21except it be for this one voice, that 
I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called 
in question before you this day. 24:22But Felix, having more exact knowledge 
concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall 
come down, I will determine your matter. 24:23And he gave order 
to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; 
and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him. 24:24But after certain 
days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, 
and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus. 24:25And as he reasoned 
of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was 
terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient 
season, I will call thee unto me. 24:26He hoped withal that money would be 
given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with 
him. 24:27But when two years were fulfilled, 
Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, 
Felix left Paul in bonds. 

25:1Festus therefore, having come into the 
province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. 25:2And the chief priests and the principal 
men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they besought him, 25:3asking a favor against him, that he 
would send for him to Jerusalem; laying a plot to kill him on the way. 25:4Howbeit Festus answered, that Paul was 
kept in charge at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart 
thither shortly. 25:5Let them therefore, saith he, that are 
of power among you go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, 
let them accuse him. 25:6And when he had tarried among them not 
more than eight or ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and on the morrow he 
sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought. 25:7And when he was 
come, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood round about him, bringing 
against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove; 25:8while Paul said in his defense, Neither 
against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I 
sinned at all. 25:9But Festus, desiring to gain favor with 
the Jews, answered Paul and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be 
judged of these things before me? 25:10But Paul said, I am standing before 
Caesar's judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no 
wrong, as thou also very well knowest. 25:11If then I am a wrong-doer, and have 
committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if none of those 
things is true whereof these accuse me, no man can give me up unto them. 
I appeal unto Caesar. 25:12Then Festus, when he had conferred 
with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Caesar: unto Caesar shalt 
thou go. 25:13Now when certain days were passed, 
Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and saluted Festus. 25:14And as they tarried there many days, 
Festus laid Paul's case before the King, saying, There is a certain man left a 
prisoner by Felix; 25:15about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, 
the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for 
sentence against him. 25:16To whom I answered, that it is not the 
custom of the Romans to give up any man, before that the accused have the 
accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defense concerning 
the matter laid against him. 25:17When therefore they were come together 
here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and 
commanded the man to be brought. 25:18Concerning whom, when the accusers 
stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed; 25:19but had certain questions against him 
of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be 
alive. 25:20And I, being perplexed how to inquire 
concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be 
judged of these matters. 25:21But when Paul had appealed to be kept 
for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send 
him to Caesar. 25:22And Agrippa said unto Festus, I 
also could wish to hear the man myself. To-morrow, saith he, thou shalt hear 
him. 25:23So on the morrow, when Agrippa was 
come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of 
hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city, at the command of 
Festus Paul was brought in. 25:24And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and 
all men who are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the 
multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that 
he ought not to live any longer. 25:25But I found that he had committed 
nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined 
to send him. 25:26Of whom I have no certain thing to 
write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially 
before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to 
write. 25:27For it seemeth to me unreasonable, in 
sending a prisoner, not withal to signify the charges against him. 

26:1And Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art 
permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his 
defence: 26:2I think myself happy, king Agrippa, 
that I am to make my defense before thee this day touching all the things 
whereof I am accused by the Jews: 26:3especially because thou art expert in 
all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to 
hear me patiently. 26:4My manner of life then from my youth 
up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at Jerusalem, know 
all the Jews; 26:5having knowledge of me from the first, 
if they be willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I 
lived a Pharisee. 26:6And now I stand here to be 
judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers; 26:7unto which promise our twelve 
tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. And 
concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king! 26:8Why is it judged 
incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead? 26:9I verily thought 
with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of 
Nazareth. 26:10And this I also did in Jerusalem: and 
I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the 
chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them. 26:11And punishing them oftentimes in all 
the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad 
against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities. 26:12Whereupon as I 
journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests, 26:13at midday, O king, I saw on the way a 
light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and 
them that journeyed with me. 26:14And when we were all fallen to the 
earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why 
persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad. 26:15And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And 
the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. 26:16But arise, and 
stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee 
a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of 
the things wherein I will appear unto thee; 26:17delivering thee 
from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee, 26:18to open their eyes, that they may turn 
from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may 
receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by 
faith in me. 26:19Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not 
disobedient unto the heavenly vision: 26:20but declared both to them of Damascus 
first and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judaea, and also to 
the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of 
repentance. 26:21For this cause the Jews seized me in 
the temple, and assayed to kill me. 26:22Having therefore obtained the help 
that is from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to small and great, 
saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come; 26:23how that the Christ must suffer, 
and how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim 
light both to the people and to the Gentiles. 26:24And as he thus 
made his defense, Festus saith with a loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; thy much 
learning is turning thee mad. 26:25But Paul saith, I am not mad, most 
excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness. 26:26For the king knoweth of these things, 
unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is 
hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner. 26:27King Agrippa, 
believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. 26:28And Agrippa 
said unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a 
Christian. 26:29And Paul said, I would to God, 
that whether with little or with much, not thou only, but also all that hear me 
this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds. 26:30And the king rose 
up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 26:31and when they had withdrawn, they 
spake one to another, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of 
bonds. 26:32And Agrippa said unto Festus, This man 
might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar. 

27:1And when it was determined that we 
should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a 
centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band. 27:2And embarking in a 
ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of 
Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. 
27:3And the next day we touched at Sidon: 
and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go unto his friends and 
refresh himself. 27:4And putting to sea from thence, we 
sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. 27:5And when we had sailed across the sea 
which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. 27:6And there the centurion found a ship of 
Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us therein. 27:7And when we had 
sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the 
wind not further suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against 
Salmone; 27:8and with difficulty coasting along it 
we came unto a certain place called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of 
Lasea. 27:9And when much time was spent, and the 
voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul 
admonished them, 27:10and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive 
that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and 
the ship, but also of our lives. 27:11But the centurion gave more heed to 
the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken 
by Paul. 27:12And because the haven was not 
commodious to winter in, the more part advised to put to sea from thence, if by 
any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there; which is a haven of 
Crete, looking northeast and south-east. 27:13And when the south 
wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed 
anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore. 27:14But after no long 
time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo: 27:15and when the ship was caught, and 
could not face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven. 27:16And running under the lee of a small 
island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat: 27:17and when they had hoisted it up, they 
used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon 
the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven. 27:18And as we labored 
exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw the the 
freight overboard; 27:19and the third day they cast out with 
their own hands the tackling of the ship. 27:20And when neither 
sun nor stars shone upon us for many days, and no small tempest lay on 
us, all hope that we should be saved was now taken away. 27:21And when they had been long without 
food, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have 
hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury 
and loss. 27:22And now I exhort you to be of good 
cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the 
ship. 27:23For there stood by me this night an 
angel of the God whose I am, whom also I serve, 27:24saying, Fear not, 
Paul; thou must stand before Caesar: and lo, God hath granted thee all them that 
sail with thee. 27:25Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for 
I believe God, that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me. 27:26But we must be cast upon a certain 
island. 27:27But when the fourteenth night was 
come, as we were driven to and fro in the sea of Adria, about midnight 
the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country: 27:28and they sounded, and found twenty 
fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen 
fathoms. 27:29And fearing lest haply we should be 
cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished 
for the day. 27:30And as the sailors were seeking to 
flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as 
though they would lay out anchors from the foreship, 27:31Paul said to the 
centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be 
saved. 27:32Then the soldiers cut away the ropes 
of the boat, and let her fall off. 27:33And while the day was coming on, Paul 
besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that 
ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing. 27:34Wherefore I 
beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not 
a hair perish from the head of any of you. 27:35And when he had 
said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; 
and he brake it, and began to eat. 27:36Then were they all of good cheer, and 
themselves also took food. 27:37And we were in all in the ship two 
hundred threescore and sixteen souls. 27:38And when they had eaten enough, they 
lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea. 27:39And when it was 
day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and 
they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it. 27:40And casting off the anchors, they left 
them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting 
up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach. 27:41But lighting upon 
a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck 
and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of 
the waves. 27:42And the soldiers' counsel was to kill 
the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape. 27:43But the centurion, desiring to save 
Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim 
should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land; 27:44and the rest, some on planks, and some 
on other things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all 
escaped safe to the land. 

28:1And when we were escaped, then we knew 
that the island was called Melita. 28:2And the barbarians showed us no common 
kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present 
rain, and because of the cold. 28:3But when Paul had gathered a bundle of 
sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and 
fastened on his hand. 28:4And when the barbarians saw the 
venomous creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No 
doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet 
Justice hath not suffered to live. 28:5Howbeit he shook off the creature into 
the fire, and took no harm. 28:6But they expected that he would have 
swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation 
and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he 
was a god. 28:7Now in the neighborhood of that place 
were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received 
us, and entertained us three days courteously. 28:8And it was so, that 
the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered 
in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him. 28:9And when this was 
done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured: 28:10who also honored us with many honors; 
and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed. 28:11And after three months we set sail in 
a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin 
Brothers. 28:12And touching at Syracuse, we tarried 
there three days. 28:13And from thence we made a circuit, and 
arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second 
day we came to Puteoli; 28:14where we found brethren, and were 
entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome. 28:15And from thence the brethren, when 
they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three 
Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. 28:16And when we entered into Rome, Paul 
was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him. 28:17And it came to pass, that after three 
days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they 
were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing 
against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner 
from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans: 28:18who, when they had 
examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death 
in me. 28:19But when the Jews spake against it, I 
was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my 
nation. 28:20For this cause therefore did I entreat 
you to see and to speak with me: for because of the hope of Israel I am 
bound with this chain. 28:21And they said unto him, We neither 
received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come 
hither and report or speak any harm of thee. 28:22But we desire to 
hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us 
that everywhere it is spoken against. 28:23And when they had appointed him a day, 
they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded the 
matter, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, 
both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening. 28:24And some believed the things which 
were spoken, and some disbelieved. 28:25And when they agreed not among 
themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the 
Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers, 28:26saying, 
 Go thou unto this people, and say, 
 By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; 
 And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive: 
 28:27For this people's heart is waxed 
gross, 
 And their ears are dull of hearing, 
 And their eyes they have closed; 
 Lest, haply they should perceive with their eyes, 
 And hear with their ears, 
 And understand with their heart, 
 And should turn again, 
 And I should heal them. 
28:28Be it known therefore unto you, that 
this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear. 28:29And when he had said these words, 
the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves. 28:30And he abode two whole years in his 
own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him, 28:31preaching the 
kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with 
all boldness, none forbidding him.
