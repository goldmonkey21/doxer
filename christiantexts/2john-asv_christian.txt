2 John. The Second Epistle of John 

1:1The elder unto the elect lady and her 
children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the 
truth; 1:2for the truth's sake which abideth in 
us, and it shall be with us for ever: 1:3Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, 
from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and 
love. 1:4I rejoice greatly that I have found 
certain of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment 
from the Father. 1:5And now I beseech thee, lady, not as 
though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the 
beginning, that we love one another. 1:6And this is love, that we should walk 
after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the 
beginning, that ye should walk in it. 1:7For many deceivers are gone forth into 
the world, even they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the 
flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. 1:8Look to yourselves, 
that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full 
reward. 1:9Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not 
in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the 
same hath both the Father and the Son. 1:10If any one cometh unto you, and 
bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into your house, and give him 
no greeting: 1:11for he that giveth him greeting 
partaketh in his evil works. 1:12Having many things to write unto you, I 
would not write them with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and 
to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full. 1:13The children of 
thine elect sister salute thee.
