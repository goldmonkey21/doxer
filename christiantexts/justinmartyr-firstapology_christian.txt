JUSTIN MARTYR -- THE FIRST APOLOGY OF JUSTIN 
CHAPTER I -- ADDRESS. 
To the Emperor Titus Ã†lius Adrianus Antoninus Pius Augustus Caesar, and to 
his son Verissimus the Philosopher, and to Lucius the Philosopher, the natural 
son of Caesar, and the adopted son of Pius, a lover of learning, and to the 
sacred Senate, with the whole People of the Romans, I, Justin, the son of 
Priscus and grandson of Bacchius, natives of Flavia Neapolis in Palestine, 
present this address and petition in behalf of those of all nations who are 
unjustly hated and wantonly abused, myself being one of them. 
CHAPTER II -- JUSTICE DEMANDED. 
Reason directs those who are truly pious and philosophical to honour and love 
only what is true, declining to follow traditional opinions, if these be 
worthless. For not only does sound reason direct us to refuse the guidance of 
those who did or taught anything wrong, but it is incumbent on the lover of 
truth, by all means, and if death be threatened, even before his own life, to 
choose to do and say what is right. Do you, then, since ye are called pious and 
philosophers, guardians of justice and lovers of learning, give good heed, and 
hearken to my address; and if ye are indeed such, it will be manifested. For we 
have come, not to flatter you by this writing, nor please you by our address, 
but to beg that you pass judgment, after an accurate and searching 
investigation, not flattered by prejudice or by a desire of pleasing 
superstitious men, nor induced by irrational impulse or evil rumours which have 
long been prevalent, to give a decision which will prove to be against 
yourselves. For as for us, we reckon that no evil can be done us, unless we be 
convicted as evil-doers or be proved to be wicked men; and you, you can kill, 
but not hurt us. 
CHAPTER III -- CLAIM OF JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION. 
But lest any one think that this is an unreasonable and reckless utterance, 
we demand that the charges against the Christians be investigated, and that, if 
these be substantiated, they be punished as they deserve; [or rather, indeed, we 
ourselves will punish them.] But if no one can convict us of anything, true 
reason forbids you, for the sake of a wicked rumour, to wrong blameless men, and 
indeed rather yourselves, who think fit to direct affairs, not by judgment, but 
by passion. And every sober-minded person will declare this to be the only fair 
and equitable adjustment, namely, that the subjects render an unexceptional 
account of their own life and doctrine; and that, on the other hand, the rulers 
should give their decision in obedience, not to violence and tyranny, but to 
piety and philosophy. For thus would both rulers and ruled reap benefit. For 
even one of the ancients somewhere said, "Unless both rulers and ruled 
philosophize, it is impossible to make states blessed." It is our task, 
therefore, to afford to all an opportunity of inspecting our life and teachings, 
lest, on account of those who are accustomed to be ignorant of our affairs, we 
should incur the penalty due to them for mental blindness; and it is your 
business, when you hear us, to be found, as reason demands, good judges. For if, 
when ye have learned the truth, you do not what is just, you will be before God 
without excuse. 
CHAPTER IV -- CHRISTIANS UNJUSTLY CONDEMNED FOR THEIR MERE NAME. 
By the mere application of a name, nothing is decided, either good or evil, 
apart from the actions implied in the name; and indeed, so far at least as one 
may judge from the name we are accused of, we are most excellent people. But as 
we do not think it just to beg to be acquitted on account of the name, if we be 
convicted as evildoers, so, on the other hand, if we be found to have committed 
no offence, either in the matter of thus naming ourselves, or of our conduct as 
citizens, it is your part very earnestly to guard against incurring just 
punishment, by unjustly punishing those who are not convicted. For from a name 
neither praise nor punishment could reasonably spring, unless something 
excellent or base in action be proved. And those among yourselves who are 
accused you do not punish before they are convicted; but in our case you receive 
the name as proof against us, and this although, so far as the name goes, you 
ought rather to punish our accusers. For we are accused of being Christians, and 
to hate what is excellent (Chrestian) is unjust. Again, if any of the accused 
deny the name, and say that he is not a Christian, you acquit him, as having no 
evidence against him as a wrong-doer; but if any one acknowledge that he is a 
Christian, you punish him on account of this acknowledgment. Justice requires 
that you inquire into the life both of him who confesses and of him who denies, 
that by his deeds it may be apparent what kind of man each is. For as some who 
have been taught by the Master, Christ, not to deny Him, give encouragement to 
others when they are put to the question, so in all probability do those who 
lead wicked lives give occasion to those who, without consideration, take upon 
them to accuse all the Christians of impiety and wickedness. And this also is 
not right. For of philosophy, too, some assume the name and the garb who do 
nothing worthy of their profession; and you are well aware, that those of the 
ancients whose opinions and teachings were quite diverse, are yet all called by 
the one name of philosophers. And of these some taught atheism; and the poets 
who have flourished among you raise a laugh out of the uncleanness of Jupiter 
with his own children. And those who now adopt such instruction are not 
restrained by you; but, on the contrary, you bestow prizes and honours upon 
those who euphoniously insult the gods. 
CHAPTER V -- CHRISTIANS CHARGED WITH ATHEISM. 
Why, then, should this be? In our case, who pledge ourselves to do no 
wickedness, nor to hold these atheistic opinions, you do not examine the charges 
made against us; but, yielding to unreasoning passion, and to the instigation of 
evil demons, you punish us without consideration or judgment. For the truth 
shall be spoken; since of old these evil demons, effecting apparitions of 
themselves, both defiled women and corrupted boys, and showed such fearful 
sights to men, that those who did not use their reason in judging of the actions 
that were done, were struck with terror; and being carried away by fear, and not 
knowing that these were demons, they called them gods, and gave to each the name 
which each of the demons chose for himself. And when Socrates endeavoured, by 
true reason and examination, to bring these things to light, and deliver men 
from the demons, then the demons themselves, by means of men who rejoiced in 
iniquity, compassed his death, as an atheist and a profane person, on the charge 
that "he was introducing new divinities;" and in our case they display a similar 
activity. For not only among the Greeks did reason (Logos) prevail to condemn 
these things through Socrates, but also among the Barbarians were they condemned 
by Reason (or the Word, the Logos) Himself, who took shape, and became man, and 
was called Jesus Christ; and in obedience to Him, we not only deny that they who 
did such things as these are gods, but assert that they are wicked and impious 
demons, whose actions will not bear comparison with those even of men desirous 
of virtue. 
CHAPTER VI -- CHARGE OF ATHEISM REFUTED. 
Hence are we called atheists. And we confess that we are atheists, so far as 
gods of this sort are concerned, but not with respect to the most true God, the 
Father of righteousness and temperance and the other virtues, who is free from 
all impurity. But both Him, and the Son (who came forth from Him and taught us 
these things, and the host of the other good angels who follow and are made like 
to Him), and the prophetic Spirit, we worship and adore, knowing them in reason 
and truth, and declaring without grudging to every one who wishes to learn, as 
we have been taught. 
CHAPTER VII -- EACH CHRISTIAN MUST BE TRIED BY HIS OWN LIFE. 
But some one will say, Some have ere now been arrested and convicted as 
evil-doers. For you condemn many, many a time, after inquiring into the life of 
each of the accused severally, but not on account of those of whom we have been 
speaking. And this we acknowledge, that as among the Greeks those who teach such 
theories as please themselves are all called by the one name "Philosopher," 
though their doctrines be diverse, so also among the Barbarians this name on 
which accusations are accumulated is the common property of those who are and 
those who seem wise. For all are called Christians. Wherefore we demand that the 
deeds of all those who are accused to you be judged, in order that each one who 
is convicted may be punished as an evil-doer, and not as a Christian; and if it 
is clear that any one is blameless, that he may be acquitted, since by the mere 
fact of his being a Christian he does no wrong. For we will not require that you 
punish our accusers; they being sufficiently punished by their present 
wickedness and ignorance of what is right. 
CHAPTER VIII -- CHRISTIANS CONFESS THEIR FAITH IN GOD. 
And reckon ye that it is for your sakes we have been saying these things; for 
it is in our power, when we are examined, to deny that we are Christians; but we 
would not live by telling a lie. For, impelled by the desire of the eternal and 
pure life, we seek the abode that is with God, the Father and Creator of all, 
and hasten to confess our faith, persuaded and convinced as we are that they who 
have proved to God by their works that they followed Him, and loved to abide 
with Him where there is no sin to cause disturbance, can obtain these things. 
This, then, to speak shortly, is what we expect and have learned from Christ, 
and teach. And Plato, in like manner, used to say that Rhadamanthus and Minos 
would punish the wicked who came before them; and we say that the same thing 
will be done, but at the hand of Christ, and upon the wicked in the same bodies 
united again to their spirits which are now to undergo everlasting punishment; 
and not only, as Plato said, for a period of a thousand years. And if any one 
say that this is incredible or impossible, this error of ours is one which 
concerns ourselves only, and no other person, so long as you cannot convict us 
of doing any harm. 
CHAPTER IX -- FOLLY OF IDOL, WORSHIP. 
And neither do we honour with many sacrifices and garlands of flowers such 
deities as men have formed and set in shrines and called gods; since we see that 
these are soulless and dead, and have not the form of God (for we do not 
consider that God has such a form as some say that they imitate to His honour), 
but have the names and forms of those wicked demons which have appeared. For why 
need we tell you who already know, into what forms the craftsmen, carving and 
cutting, casting and hammering, fashion the materials? And often out of vessels 
of dishonour, by merely changing the form, and making an image of the requisite 
shape, they make what they call a god; which we consider not only senseless, but 
to be even insulting to God, who, having ineffable glory and form, thus gets His 
name attached to things that are corruptible, and require constant service. And 
that the artificers of these are both intemperate, and, not to enter into 
particulars, are practised in every vice, you very well know; even their own 
girls who work along with them they corrupt. What infatuation! that dissolute 
men should be said to fashion and make gods for your worship, and that you 
should appoint such men the guardians of the temples where they are enshrined; 
not recognising that it is unlawful even to think or say that men are the 
guardians of gods. 
CHAPTER X -- HOW GOD IS TO BE SERVED. 
But we have received by tradition that God does not need the material 
offerings which men can give, seeing, indeed, that He Himself is the provider of 
all things. And we have been taught, and are convinced, and do believe, that He 
accepts those only who imitate the excellences which reside in Him, temperance, 
and justice, and philanthropy, and as many virtues as are peculiar to a God who 
is called by no proper name. And we have been taught that He in the beginning 
did of His goodness, for man's sake, create all things out of unformed matter; 
and if men by their works show themselves worthy of this His design, they are 
deemed worthy, and so we have received--of reigning in company with Him, being 
delivered from corruption and suffering. For as in the beginning He created us 
when we were not, so do we consider that, in like manner, those who choose what 
is pleasing to Him are, on account of their choice, deemed worthy of 
incorruption and of fellowship with Him. For the coming into being at first was 
not in our own power; and in order that we may follow those things which please 
Him, choosing them by means of the rational faculties He has Himself endowed us 
with, He both persuades us and leads us to faith. And we think it for the 
advantage of all men that they are not restrained from learning these things, 
but are even urged thereto. For the restraint which human laws could not effect, 
the Word, inasmuch as He is divine, would have effected, had not the wicked 
demons, taking as their ally the lust of wickedness which is in every man, and 
which draws variously to all manner of vice, scattered many false and profane 
accusations, none of which attach to us. 
CHAPTER XI -- WHAT KINGDOM CHRISTIANS LOOK FOR. 
And when you hear that we look for a kingdom, you suppose, without making any 
inquiry, that we speak of a human kingdom; whereas we speak of that which is 
with God, as appears also from the confession of their faith made by those who 
are charged with being Christians, though they know that death is the punishment 
awarded to him who so confesses. For if we looked for a human kingdom, we should 
also deny our Christ, that we might not be slain; and we should strive to escape 
detection, that we might obtain what we expect. But since our thoughts are not 
fixed on the present, we are not concerned when men cut us off; since also death 
is a debt which must at all events be paid. 
CHAPTER XII -- CHRISTIANS LIVE AS UNDER GOD'S EYE. 
And more than all other men are we your helpers and allies in promoting 
peace, seeing that we hold this view, that it is alike impossible for the 
wicked, the covetous, the conspirator, and for the virtuous, to escape the 
notice of God, and that each man goes to everlasting punishment or salvation 
according to the value of his actions. For if all men knew this, no one would 
choose wickedness even for a little, knowing that he goes to the everlasting 
punishment of fire; but would by all means restrain himself, and adorn himself 
with virtue, that he might obtain the good gifts of God, and escape the 
punishments. For those who, on account of the laws and punishments you impose, 
endeavour to escape detection when they offend (and they offend, too, under the 
impression that it is quite possible to escape your detection, since you are but 
men), those persons, if they learned and were convinced that nothing, whether 
actually done or only intended, can escape the knowledge of God, would by all 
means live decently on account of the penalties threatened, as even you 
yourselves will admit. But you seem to fear lest all men become righteous, and 
you no longer have any to punish. Such would be the concern of public 
executioners, but not of good princes. But, as we before said, we are persuaded 
that these things are prompted by evil spirits, who demand sacrifices and 
service even from those who live unreasonably; but as for you, we presume that 
you who aim at [a reputation for] piety and philosophy will do nothing 
unreasonable. But if you also, like the foolish, prefer custom to truth, do what 
you have power to do. But just so much power have rulers who esteem opinion more 
than truth, as robbers have in a desert. And that you will not succeed is 
declared by the Word, than whom, after God who begat Him, we know there is no 
ruler more kingly and just. For as all shrink from succeeding to the poverty or 
sufferings or obscurity of their fathers, so whatever the Word forbids us to 
choose, the sensible man will not choose. That all these things should come to 
pass, I say, our Teacher foretold, He who is both Son and Apostle of God the 
Father of all and the Ruler, Jesus Christ; from whom also we have the name of 
Christians. Whence we become more assured of all the things He taught us, since 
whatever He beforehand foretold should come to pass, is seen in fact coming to 
pass; and this is the work of God, to tell of a thing before it happens, and as 
it was foretold so to show it happening. It were possible to pause here and add 
no more, reckoning that we demand what is just and true; but because we are well 
aware that it is not easy suddenly to change a mind possessed by ignorance, we 
intend to add a few things, for the sake of persuading those who love the truth, 
knowing that it is not impossible to put ignorance to flight by presenting the 
truth. 
CHAPTER XIIL -- CHRISTIANS SERVE GOD RATIONALLY. 
What sober-minded man, then, will not acknowledge that we are not atheists, 
worshipping as we do the Maker of this universe, and declaring, as we have been 
taught, that He has no need of streams of blood and libations and incense; whom 
we praise to the utmost of our power by the exercise of prayer and thanksgiving 
for all things wherewith we are supplied, as we have been taught that the only 
honour that is worthy of Him is not to consume by fire what He has brought into 
being for our sustenance, but to use it for ourselves and those who need, and 
with gratitude to Him to offer thanks by invocations and hymns for our creation, 
and for all the means of health, and for the various qualities of the different 
kinds of things, and for the changes of the seasons; and to present before Him 
petitions for our existing again in incorruption through faith in Him. Our 
teacher of these things is Jesus Christ, who also was born for this purpose, and 
was crucified under Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judaea, in the times of 
Tiberius Caesar; and that we reasonably worship Him, having learned that He is 
the Son of the true God Himself, and holding Him in the second place, and the 
prophetic Spirit in the third, we will prove. For they proclaim our madness to 
consist in this, that we give to a crucified man a place second to the 
unchangeable and eternal God, the Creator of all; for they do not discern the 
mystery that is herein, to which, as we make it plain to you, we pray you to 
give heed. 
CHAPTER XIV -- THE DEMONS MISREPRESENT CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE. 
For we forewarn you to be on your guard, lest those demons whom we have been 
accusing should deceive you, and quite diver you from reading and understanding 
what we say. For they strive to hold you their slaves and servants; and 
sometimes by appearances in dreams, and sometimes by magical impositions, they 
subdue all who make no strong opposing effort for their own salvation. And thus 
do we also, since our persuasion by the Word, stand aloof from them (i.e., the 
demons), and follow the only unbegotten God through His Son--we who formerly 
delighted in fornication, but now embrace chastity alone; we who formerly used 
magical arts, dedicate ourselves to the good and unbegotten God; we who valued 
above all things the acquisition of wealth and possessions, now bring what we 
have into a common stock, and communicate to every one in need; we who hated and 
destroyed one another, and on account of their different manners would not live 
with men of a different tribe, now, since the coming of Christ, live familiarly 
with them, and pray for our enemies, and endeavour to persuade those who hate us 
unjustly to live comformably to the good precepts of Christ, to the end that 
they may become par-takers with us of the same joyful hope of a reward from God 
the ruler of all. But lest we should seem to be reasoning sophistically, we 
consider it right, before giving you the promised explanation, to cite a few 
precepts given by Christ Himself. And be it yours, as powerful rulers, to 
inquire whether we have been taught and do teach these things truly. Brief and 
concise utterances fell from Him, for He was no sophist, but His word was the 
power of God. 
CHAPTER XV -- WHAT CHRIST HIMSELF TAUGHT. 
Concerning chastity, He uttered such sentiments as these: "Whosoever looketh 
upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his 
heart before God." And, "If thy right eye offend thee, cut it out; for it is 
better for thee to enter into the kingdom of heaven with one eye, than, having 
two eyes, to be cast into everlasting fire." And, "Whosoever shall many her that 
is divorced from another husband, committeth adultery." And, "There are some who 
have been made eunuchs of men, and some who were born eunuchs, and some who have 
made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake; but all cannot receive 
this saying." So that all who, by human law, are twice married, are in the eye 
of our Master sinners, and those who look upon a woman to lust after her. For 
not only he who in act commits adultery is rejected by Him, but also he who 
desires to commit adultery: since not only our works, but also our thoughts, are 
open before God. And many, both men and women, who have been Christ's disciples 
from childhood, remain pure at the age of sixty or seventy years; and I boast 
that I could produce such from every race of men. For what shall I say, too, of 
the countless multitude of those who have reformed intemperate habits, and 
learned these things? For Christ called not the just nor the chaste to 
repentance, but the ungodly, and the licentious, and the unjust; His words 
being, "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." For the 
heavenly Father desires rather the repentance than the punishment of the sinner. 
And of our love to all, He taught thus: "If ye love them that love you, what new 
thing do ye? for even fornicators do this. But I say unto you, Pray for your 
enemies, and love them that hate you, and bless them that curse you, and pray 
for them that despitefully use you." And that we should communicate to the 
needy, and do nothing for glory, He said, "Give to him that asketh, and from him 
that would borrow turn not away; for if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to 
receive, what new thing do ye? even the publicans do this. Lay not up for 
yourselves treasure upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where 
robbers break through; but lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven, where 
neither moth nor rust doth corrupt. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain 
the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for 
it? Lay up treasure, therefore, in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth 
corrupt." And, "Be ye kind and merciful, as your Father also is kind and 
merciful, and maketh His sun to rise on sinners, and the righteous, and the 
wicked. Take no thought what ye shall eat, or what ye shall put on: are ye not 
better than the birds and the beasts? And God feedeth them. Take no thought, 
therefore, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall put on; for your heavenly Father 
knoweth that ye have need of these things. But seek ye the kingdom of heaven, 
and all these things shall be added unto you. For where his treasure is, there 
also is the mind of a man." And, "Do not these things to be seen of men; 
otherwise ye have no reward from your Father which is in heaven." 
CHAPTER XVI -- CONCERNING PATIENCE AND SWEARING. 
And concerning our being patient of injuries, and ready to serve all, and 
free from anger, this is what He said: "To him that smiteth thee on the one 
cheek, offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak or coat, forbid 
not. And whosoever shall be angry, is in danger of the fire. And every one that 
compelleth thee to go with him a mile, follow him two. And let your good works 
shine before men, that they, seeing them, may glorify your Father which is in 
heaven." For we ought not to strive; neither has He desired us to be imitators 
of wicked men, but He has exhorted us to lead all men, by patience and 
gentleness, from shame and the love of evil. And this indeed is proved in the 
case of many who once were of your way of thinking, but have changed their 
violent and tyrannical disposition, being overcome either by the constancy which 
they have witnessed in their neighbours' lives, or by the extraordinary 
forbearance they have observed in their fellow-travellers when defrauded, or by 
the honesty of those with whom they have transacted business. 
And with regard to our not swearing at all, and always speaking the truth, He 
enjoined as follows: "Swear not at all; but let your yea be yea, and your nay, 
nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil." And that we ought to 
worship God alone, He thus persuaded us: "The greatest commandment is, Thou 
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve, with all thy 
heart, and with all thy strength, the Lord God that made thee." And when a 
certain man came to Him and said, "Good Master," He answered and said, "There is 
none good but God only, who made all things." And let those who are not found 
living as He taught, be understood to be no Christians, even though they profess 
with the lip the precepts of Christ; for not those who make profession, but 
those who do the works, shall be saved, according to His word: "Not every one 
who saith to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that 
doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven. For whosoever heareth Me, and 
doeth My sayings, heareth Him that sent Me. And many will say unto Me, Lord, 
Lord, have we not eaten and drunk in Thy name, and done wonders? And then will I 
say unto them, Depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity. Then shall there be 
wailing and gnashing of teeth, when the righteous shall shine as the sun, and 
the wicked are sent into everlasting fire. For many shall come in My name, 
clothed outwardly in sheep's clothing, but inwardly being ravening wolves. By 
their works ye shall know them. And every tree that bringeth not forth good 
fruit, is hewn down and cast into the fire." And as to those who are not living 
pursuant to these His teachings, and are Christians only in name, we demand that 
all such be punished by you. 
CHAPTER XVII -- CHRIST TAUGHT CIVIL OBEDIENCE. 
And everywhere we, more readily than all men, endeavour to pay to those 
appointed by you the taxes both ordinary and extraordinary, as we have been 
taught by Him; for at that time some came to Him and asked Him, if one ought to 
pay tribute to Caesar; and He answered, "Tell Me, whose image does the coin 
bear?" And they said, "Caesar's." And again He answered them, "Render therefore 
to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." 
Whence to God alone we render worship, but in other things we gladly serve you, 
acknowledging you as kings and rulers of men, and praying that with your kingly 
power you be found to possess also sound judgment. But if you pay no regard to 
our prayers and frank explanations, we shall suffer no loss, since we believe 
(or rather, indeed, are persuaded) that every man will suffer punishment in 
eternal fire according to the merit of his deed, and will render account 
according to the power he has received from God, as Christ intimated when He 
said, "To whom God has given more, of him shall more be required." 
CHAPTER XVIII -- PROOF OF IMMORTALITY AND THE RESURRECTION. 
For reflect upon the end of each of the preceding kings, how they died the 
death common to all, which, if it issued in insensibility, would be a godsend to 
all the wicked. But since sensation remains to all who have ever lived, and 
eternal punishment is laid up (i.e., for the wicked), see that ye neglect not to 
be convinced, and to hold as your belief, that these things are true. For let 
even necromancy, and the divinations you practise by immaculate children, and 
the evoking of departed human souls, and those who are called among the magi, 
Dream-senders and Assistant-spirits (Familiars), and all that is done by those 
who are skilled in such matters--let these persuade you that even after death 
souls are in a state of sensation; and those who are seized and cast about by 
the spirits of the dead, whom all call daemoniacs or madmen; and what you repute 
as oracles, both of Amphilochus, Dodana, Pytho, and as many other such as exist; 
and the opinions of your authors, Empedocles and Pythagoras, Plato and Socrates, 
and the pit of Homer, and the descent of Ulysses to inspect these things, and 
all that has been uttered of a like kind. Such favour as you grant to these, 
grant also to us, who not less but more firmly than they believe in God; since 
we expect to receive again our own bodies, though they be dead and cast into the 
earth, for we maintain that with God nothing is impossible. 
CHAPTER XIX -- THE RESURRECTION POSSIBLE. 
And to any thoughtful person would anything appear more incredible, than, if 
we were not in the body, and some one were to say that it was possible that from 
a small drop of human seed bones and sinews and flesh be formed into a shape 
such as we see? For let this now be said hypothetically: if you yourselves were 
not such as you now are, and born of such parents [and causes], and one were to 
show you human seed and a picture of a man, and were to say with confidence that 
from such a substance such a being could be produced, would you believe before 
you saw the actual production? No one will dare to deny [that such a statement 
would surpass belief]. In the same way, then, you are now incredulous because 
you have never seen a dead man rise again. But as at first you would not have 
believed it possible that such persons could be produced from the small drop, 
and yet now you see them thus produced, so also judge ye that it is not 
impossible that the bodies of men, after they have been dissolved, and like 
seeds resolved into earth, should in God's appointed time rise again and put on 
incorruption. For what power worthy of God those imagine who say, that each 
thing returns to that from which it was produced, and that beyond this not even 
God Himself can do anything, we are unable to conceive; but this we see clearly, 
that they would not have believed it possible that they could have become such 
and produced from such materials, as they now see both themselves and the whole 
world to be. And that it is better to believe even what is impossible to our own 
nature and to men, than to be unbelieving like the rest of the world, we have 
learned; for we know that our Master Jesus Christ said, that "what is impossible 
with men is possible with God," and, "Fear not them that kill you, and after 
that can do no more; but fear Him who after death is able to cast both soul and 
body into hell." And hell is a place where those are to be punished who have 
lived wickedly, and who do not believe that those things which God has taught us 
by Christ will come to pass. 
CHAPTER XX -- HEATHEN ANALOGIES TO CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE. 
And the Sibyl and Hystaspes said that there should be a dissolution by God of 
things corruptible. And the philosophers called Stoics teach that even God 
Himself shall be resolved into fire, and they say that the world is to be formed 
anew by this revolution; but we understand that God, the Creator of all things, 
is superior to the things that are to be changed. If, therefore, on some points 
we teach the same things as the poets and philosophers whom you honour, and on 
other points are fuller and more divine in our teaching, and if we alone afford 
proof of what we assert, why are we unjustly hated more than all others? For 
while we say that all things have been produced and arranged into a world by 
God, we shall seem to utter the doctrine of Plato; and while we say that there 
will be a burning up of all, we shall seem to utter the doctrine of the Stoics: 
and while we affirm that the souls of the wicked, being endowed with sensation 
even after death, are punished, and that those of the good being delivered from 
punishment spend a blessed existence, we shall seem to say the same things as 
the poets and philosophers; and while we maintain that men ought not to worship 
the works of their hands, we say the very things which have been said by the 
comic poet Menander, and other similar writers, for they have declared that the 
workman is greater than the work. 
CHAPTER XXI -- ANALOGIES TO THE HISTORY OF CHRIST. 
And when we say also that the Word, who is the first-birth of God, was 
produced without sexual union, and that He, Jesus Christ, our Teacher, was 
crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propound 
nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you esteem sons of 
Jupiter. For you know how many sons your esteemed writers ascribed to Jupiter: 
Mercury, the interpreting word and teacher of all; AEsculapius, who, though he 
was a great physician, was struck by a thunderbolt, and so ascended to heaven; 
and Bacchus too, after he had been torn limb from limb; and Hercules, when he 
had committed himself to the flames to escape his toils; and the sons of Leda, 
and Dioscuri; and Perseus, son of Danae; and Bellerophon, who, though sprung 
from mortals, rose to heaven on the horse Pegasus. For what shall I say of 
Ariadne, and those who, like her, have been declared to be set among the stars? 
And what of the emperors who die among yourselves, whom you deem worthy of 
deification, and in whose behalf you produce some one who swears he has seen the 
burning Caesar rise to heaven from the funeral pyre? And what kind of deeds are 
recorded of each of these reputed sons of Jupiter, it is needless to tell to 
those who already know. This only shall be said, that they are written for the 
advantage and encouragement of youthful scholars; for all reckon it an 
honourable thing to imitate the gods. But far be such a thought concerning the 
gods from every well-conditioned soul, as to believe that Jupiter himself, the 
governor and creator of all things, was both a parricide and the son of a 
parricide, and that being overcome by the love of base and shameful pleasures, 
he came in to Ganymede and those many women whom he had violated and that his 
sons did like actions. But, as we said above, wicked devils perpetrated these 
things. And we have learned that those only are deified who have lived near to 
God in holiness and virtue; and we believe that those who live wickedly and do 
not repent are punished in everlasting fire. 
CHAPTER XXII -- ANALOGIES TO THE SONSHIP OF CHRIST. 
Moreover, the Son of God called Jesus, even if only a man by ordinary 
generation, yet, on account of His wisdom, is worthy to be called the Son of 
God; for all writers call God the Father of men and gods. And if we assert that 
the Word of God was born of God in a peculiar manner, different from ordinary 
generation, let this, as said above, be no extraordinary thing to you, who say 
that Mercury is the angelic word of God. But if any one objects that He was 
crucified, in this also He is on a par with those reputed sons of Jupiter of 
yours, who suffered as we have now enumerated. For their sufferings at death are 
recorded to have been not all alike, but diverse; so that not even by the 
peculiarity of His sufferings does He seem to be inferior to them; but, on the 
contrary, as we promised in the preceding part of this discourse, we will now 
prove Him superior--or rather have already proved Him to be so--for the superior 
is revealed by His actions. And if we even affirm that He was born of a virgin, 
accept this in common with what you accept of Ferseus. And in that we say that 
He made whole the lame, the paralytic, and those born blind, we seem to say what 
is very similar to the deeds said to have been done by AEsculapius. 
CHAPTER XXIII -- THE ARGUMENT. 
And that this may now become evident to you--(firstly) that whatever we 
assert in conformity with what has been taught us by Christ, and by the prophets 
who preceded Him, are alone true, and are older than all the writers who have 
existed; that we claim to be acknowledged, not because we say the same things as 
these writers said, but because we say true things: and (secondly) that Jesus 
Christ is the only proper Son who has been begotten by God, being His Word and 
first-begotten, and power; and, becoming man according to His will, He taught us 
these things for the conversion and restoration of the human race: and (thirdly) 
that before He became a man among men, some, influenced by the demons before 
mentioned, related beforehand, through the instrumentality of the poets, those 
circumstances as having really happened, which, having fictitiously devised, 
they narrated, in the same manner as they have caused to be fabricated the 
scandalous reports against us of infamous and impious actions, of which there is 
neither witness nor proof--we shall bring forward the following proof. 
CHAPTER XXIV -- VARIETIES OF HEATHEN WORSHIP. 
In the first place [we furnish proof], because, though we say things similar 
to what the Greeks say, we only are hated on account of the name of Christ, and 
though we do no wrong, are put to death as sinners; other men in other places 
worshipping trees and rivers, and mice and cats and crocodiles, and many 
irrational animals. Nor are the same animals esteemed by all; but in one place 
one is worshipped, and another in another, so that all are profane in the 
judgment of one another, on account of their not worshipping the same objects. 
And this is the sole accusation you bring against us, that we do not reverence 
the same gods as you do, nor offer to the dead libations and the savour of fat, 
and crowns for their statues, and sacrifices. For you very well know that the 
same animals are with some esteemed gods, with others wild beasts, and with 
others sacrificial victims. 
CHAPTER XXV -- FALSE GODS ABANDONED BY CHRISTIANS. 
And, secondly, because we--who, out of every race of men, used to worship 
Bacchus the son of Semele, and Apollo the son of Latona (who in their loves with 
men did such things as it is shameful even to mention), and Proserpine and Venus 
(who were maddened with love of Adonis, and whose mysteries also you celebrate), 
or AEsculapius, or some one or other of those who are called gods--have now, 
through Jesus Christ, learned to despise these, though we be threatened with 
death for it, and have dedicated ourselves to the unbegotten and impossible God; 
of whom we are persuaded that never was he goaded by lust of Antiope, or such 
other women, or of Ganymede, nor was rescued by that hundred-handed giant whose 
aid was obtained through Thetis, nor was anxious on this account that her son 
Achilles should destroy many of the Greeks because of his concubine Briseis. 
Those who believe these things we pity, and those who invented them we know to 
be devils. 
CHAPTER XXVI -- MAGICIANS NOT TRUSTED BY CHRISTIANS. 
And, thirdly, because after Christ's ascension into heaven the devils put 
forward certain men who said that they themselves were gods; and they were not 
only not persecuted by you, but even deemed worthy of honours. There was a 
Samaritan, Simon, a native of the village called Gitto, who in the reign of 
Claudius Caesar, and in your royal city of Rome, did mighty acts of magic, by 
virtue of the art of the devils operating in him. He was considered a god, and 
as a god was honoured by you with a statue, which statue was erected on the 
river Tiber, between the two bridges, and bore this inscription, in the language 
of Rome:-- 
"Simoni Deo Sancto," 
"To Simon the holy God." And almost all the Samaritans, and a few even of 
other nations, worship him, and acknowledge him as the first god; and a woman, 
Helena, who went about with him at that time, and had formerly been a 
prostitute, they say is the first idea generated by him. And a man, Meander, 
also a Samaritan, of the town Capparetaea, a disciple of Simon, and inspired by 
devils, we know to have deceived many while he was in Antioch by his magical 
art. He persuaded those who adhered to him that they should never die, and even 
now there are some living who hold this opinion of his. And there is Marcion, a 
man of Pontus, who is even at this day alive, and teaching his disciples to 
believe in some other god greater than the Creator. And he, by the aid of the 
devils, has caused many of every nation to speak blasphemies, and to deny that 
God is the maker of this universe, and to assert that some other being, greater 
than He, has done greater works. All who take their opinions from these men, 
are, as we before said, called Christians; just as also those who do not agree 
with the philosophers in their doctrines, have yet in common with them the name 
of philosophers given to them. And whether they perpetrate those fabulous and 
shameful deeds--the upsetting of the lamp, and promiscuous intercourse, and 
eating human flesh--we know not; but we do know that they are neither persecuted 
nor put to death by you, at least on account of their opinions. But I have a 
treatise against all the heresies that have existed already composed, which, if 
you wish to read it, I will give you. 
CHAPTER XXVII -- GUILT OF EXPOSING CHILDREN. 
But as for us, we have been taught that to expose newly-born children is the 
part of wicked men; and this we have been taught lest we should do any one an 
injury, and lest we should sin against God, first, because we see that almost 
all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the males) are brought up to 
prostitution. And as the ancients are said to have reared herds of oxen, or 
goats, or sheep, or grazing horses, so now we see you rear children only for 
this shameful use; and for this pollution a multitude of females and 
hermaphrodites, and those who commit unmentionable iniquities, are found in 
every nation. And you receive the hire of these, and duty and taxes from them, 
whom you ought to exterminate from your realm. And any one who uses such 
persons, besides the godless and infamous and impure intercourse, may possibly 
be having intercourse with his own child, or relative, or brother. And there are 
some who prostitute even their own children and wives, and some are openly 
mutilated for the purpose of sodomy; and they refer these mysteries to the 
mother of the gods, and along with each of those whom you esteem gods there is 
painted a serpent, a great symbol and mystery. Indeed, the things which you do 
openly and with applause, as if the divine light were overturned and 
extinguished, these you lay to our charge; which, in truth, does no harm to us 
who shrink from doing any such things, but only to those who do them and bear 
false witness against us. 
CHAPTER XXVIII -- GOD'S CARE FOR MEN. 
For among us the prince of the wicked spirits is called the serpent, and 
Satan, and the devil, as you can learn by looking into our writings. And that he 
would be sent into the fire with his host, and the men who follow him, and would 
be punished for an endless duration, Christ foretold. For the reason why God has 
delayed to do this, is His regard for the human race. For He fore-knows that 
some are to be saved by repentance, some even that are perhaps not yet born. In 
the beginning He made the human race with the power of thought and of choosing 
the truth and doing right, so that all men are without excuse before God; for 
they have been born rational and contemplative. And if any one disbelieves that 
God cares for these things, he will thereby either insinuate that God does not 
exist, or he will assert that though He exists He delights in vice, or exists 
like a stone, and that neither virtue nor vice are anything, but only in the 
opinion of men these things are reckoned good or evil. And this is the greatest 
profanity and wickedness. 
CHAPTER XXIX -- CONTINENCE OF CHRISTIANS. 
And again [we fear to expose children], lest some of them be not picked up, 
but die, and we become murderers. But whether we marry, it is only that we may 
bring up children; or whether we decline marriage, we live continently. And that 
you may understand that promiscuous intercourse is not one of our mysteries, one 
of our number a short time ago presented to Felix the governor in Alexandria a 
petition, craving that permission might be given to a surgeon to make him an 
eunuch. For the surgeons there said that they were forbidden to do this without 
the permission of the governor. And when Felix absolutely refused to sign such a 
permission, the youth remained single, and was satisfied with his own approving 
conscience, and the approval of those who thought as he did. And it is not out 
of place, we think, to mention here Antinous, who was alive but lately, and whom 
all were prompt, through fear, to worship as a god, though they knew both who he 
was and what was his origin. 
CHAPTER XXX -- WAS CHRIST NOT A MAGICIAN? 
But lest any one should meet us with the question, What should prevent that 
He whom we call Christ, being a man born of men, performed what we call His 
mighty works by magical art, and by this appeared to be the Son of God? we will 
now offer proof, not trusting mere assertions, but being of necessity persuaded 
by those who prophesied [of Him] before these things came to pass, for with our 
own eyes we behold things that have happened and are happening just as they were 
predicted; and this will, we think appear even to you the strongest and truest 
evidence. 
CHAPTER XXXI -- OF THE HEBREW PROPHETS. 
There were, then, among the Jews certain men who were prophets of God, 
through whom the prophetic Spirit published beforehand things that were to come 
to pass, ere ever they happened. And their prophecies, as they were spoken and 
when they were uttered, the kings who happened to be reigning among the Jews at 
the several times carefully preserved in their possession, when they had been 
arranged in books by the prophets themselves in their own Hebrew language. And 
when Ptolemy king of Egypt formed a library, and endeavoured to collect the 
writings of all men, he heard also of these prophets, and sent to Herod, who was 
at that time king of the Jews, requesting that the books of the prophets be sent 
to him. And Herod the king did indeed send them, written, as they were, in the 
foresaid Hebrew language. And when their contents were found to be 
unintelligible to the Egyptians, he again sent and requested that men be 
commissioned to translate them into the Greek language. And when this was done, 
the books remained with the Egyptians, where they are until now. They are also 
in the possession of all Jews throughout the world; but they, though they read, 
do not understand what is said, but count us foes and enemies; and, like 
yourselves, they kill and punish us whenever they have the power, as you can 
well believe. For in the Jewish war which lately raged, Barchochebas, the leader 
of the revolt of the Jews, gave orders that Christians alone should be led to 
cruel punishments, unless they would deny Jesus Christ and utter blasphemy. In 
these books, then, of the prophets we found Jesus our Christ foretold as coming, 
born of a virgin, growing up to man's estate, and healing every disease and 
every sickness, and raising the dead, and being hated, and unrecognised, and 
crucified, and dying, and rising again, and ascending into heaven, and being, 
and being called, the Son of God. We find it also predicted that certain persons 
should be sent by Him into every nation to publish these things, and that rather 
among the Gentiles [than among the Jews] men should believe on Him. And He was 
predicted before He appeared, first 5000 years before, and again 3000, then 
2000, then 1000, and yet again 800; for in the succession of generations 
prophets after prophets arose. 
CHAPTER XXXII -- CHRIST PREDICTED BY MOSES. Moses then, who was the first of 
the prophets, spoke in these very words: "The sceptre shall not depart from 
Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until He come for whom it is 
reserved; and He shall be the desire of the nations, binding His foal to the 
vine, washing His robe in the blood of the grape." It is yours to make accurate 
inquiry, and ascertain up to whose time the Jews had a lawgiver and king of 
their own. Up to the time of Jesus Christ, who taught us, and interpreted the 
prophecies which were not yet understood, [they had a lawgiver] as was foretold 
by the holy and divine Spirit of prophecy through Moses, "that a ruler would not 
fail the Jews until He should come for whom the kingdom was reserved" (for Judah 
was the forefather of the Jews, from whom also they have their name of Jews); 
and after He (i.e., Christ) appeared, you began to rule the Jews, and gained 
possession of all their territory. And the prophecy, "He shall be the 
expectation of the nations," signified that there would be some of all nations 
who should look for Him to come again. And this indeed you can see for 
yourselves, and be convinced of by fact. For of all races of men there are some 
who look for Him who was crucified in Judaea, and after whose crucifixion the 
land was straightway surrendered to you as spoil of war. And the prophecy, 
"binding His foal to the vine, and washing His robe in the blood of the grape," 
was a significant symbol of the things that were to happen to Christ, and of 
what He was to do. For the foal of an ass stood bound to a vine at the entrance 
of a village, and He ordered His acquaintances to bring it to Him then; and when 
it was brought, He mounted and sat upon it, and entered Jerusalem, where was the 
vast temple of the Jews which was afterwards destroyed by you. And after this He 
was crucified, that the rest of the prophecy might be fulfilled. For this 
"washing His robe in the blood of the grape" was predictive of the passion He 
was to endure, cleansing by His blood those who believe on Him. For what is 
called by the Divine Spirit through the prophet "His robe," are those men who 
believe in Him in whom abideth the seed of God, the Word. And what is spoken of 
as "the blood of the grape," signifies that He who should appear would have 
blood, though not of the seed of man, but of the power of God. And the first 
power after God the Father and Lord of all is the Word, who is also the Son; and 
of Him we will, in what follows, relate how He took flesh and became man. For as 
man did not make the blood of the vine, but God, so it was hereby intimated that 
the blood should not be of human seed, but of divine power, as we have said 
above. And Isaiah, another prophet, foretelling the same things in other words, 
spoke thus: "A star shall rise out of Jacob, and a flower shall spring from the 
root of Jesse; and His arm shall the nations trust." And a star of light has 
arisen, and a flower has sprung from the root of Jesse--this Christ. For by the 
power of God He was conceived by a virgin of the seed of Jacob, who was the 
father of Judah, who, as we have shown, was the father of the Jews; and Jesse 
was His forefather according to the oracle, and He was the son of Jacob and 
Judah according to lineal descent. 
CHAPTER XXXIII -- MANNER OF CHRIST'S BIRTH PREDICTED. 
And hear again how Isaiah in express words foretold that He should be born of 
a virgin; for he spoke thus: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bring forth a 
son, and they shall say for His name, 'God with us.' " For things which were 
incredible and seemed impossible with men, these God predicted by the Spirit of 
prophecy as about to come to pass, in order that, when they came to pass, there 
might be no unbelief, but faith, because of their prediction. But lest some, not 
understanding the prophecy now cited, should charge us with the very things we 
have been laying to the charge of the poets who say that Jupiter went in to 
women through lust, let us try to explain the words. This, then, "Behold, a 
virgin shall conceive," signifies that a virgin should conceive without 
intercourse. For if she had had intercourse with any one whatever, she was no 
longer a virgin; but the power of God having come upon the virgin, overshadowed 
her, and caused her while yet a virgin to conceive. And the angel of God who was 
sent to the same virgin at that time brought her good news, saying, "Behold, 
thou shalt conceive of the Holy Ghost, and shalt bear a Son, and He shall be 
called the Son of the Highest, and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall 
save His people from their sins,"--as they who have recorded all that concerns 
our Saviour Jesus Christ have taught, whom we believed, since by Isaiah also, 
whom we have now adduced, the Spirit of prophecy declared that He should be born 
as we intimated before. It is wrong, therefore, to understand the Spirit and the 
power of God as anything else than the Word, who is also the first-born of God, 
as the foresaid prophet Moses declared; and it was this which, when it came upon 
the virgin and overshadowed her, caused her to conceive, not by intercourse, but 
by power. And the name Jesus in the Hebrew language means Swthr 
(Saviour) in the Greek tongue. Wherefore, too, the angel said to the virgin, 
"Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins." 
And that the prophets are inspired by no other than the Divine Word, even you, 
as I fancy, will grant. 
CHAPTER XXXIV -- PLACE OF CHRIST'S BIRTH FORETOLD. 
And hear what part of earth He was to be born in, as another prophet, Micah, 
foretold. He spoke thus: "And thou, Bethlehem, the land of Judah, art not the 
least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come forth a Governor, 
who shall feed My people." Now there is a village in the land of the Jews, 
thirty-five stadia from Jerusalem, in which Jesus Christ was born, as you can 
ascertain also from the registers of the taxing made under Cyrenius, your first 
procurator in Judaea. 
CHAPTER XXXV -- OTHER FULFILLED PROPHECIES. 
And how Christ after He was born was to escape the notice of other men until 
He grew to man's estate, which also came to pass, hear what was foretold 
regarding this. There are the following predictions:--"Unto us a child is born, 
and unto us a young man is given, and the government shall be upon His 
shoulders;" which is significant of the power of the cross, for to it, when He 
was crucified, He applied His shoulders, as shall be more clearly made out in 
the ensuing discourse. And again the same prophet Isaiah, being inspired by the 
prophetic Spirit, said, "I have spread out my hands to a disobedient and 
gainsaying people, to those who walk in a way that is not good. They now ask of 
me judgment, and dare to draw near to God." And again in other words, through 
another prophet, He says, "They pierced My hands and My feet, and for My vesture 
they cast lots." And indeed David, the king and prophet, who uttered these 
things, suffered none of them; but Jesus Christ stretched forth His hands, being 
crucified by the Jews speaking against Him, and denying that He was the Christ. 
And as the prophet spoke, they tormented Him, and set Him on the judgment-seat, 
and said, Judge us. And the expression, "They pierced my hands and my feet," was 
used in reference to the nails of the cross which were fixed in His hands and 
feet. And after He was crucified they cast lots upon His vesture, and they that 
crucified Him parted it among them. And that these things did happen, you can 
ascertain from the Acts of Pontius Pilate. And we will cite the prophetic 
utterances of another prophet, Zephaniah, to the effect that He was foretold 
expressly as to sit upon the foal of an ass and to enter Jerusalem. The words 
are these: "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: 
behold, thy King cometh unto thee; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a 
colt the foal of an ass." 
CHAPTER XXXVI -- DIFFERENT MODES OF PROPHECY. 
But when you hear the utterances of the prophets spoken as it were 
personally, you must not suppose that they are spoken by the inspired 
themselves, but by the Divine Word who moves them. For sometimes He declares 
things that are to come to pass, in the manner of one who foretells the future; 
sometimes He speaks as from the person of God the Lord and Father of all; 
sometimes as from the person of Christ; sometimes as from the person of the 
people answering the Lord or His Father, just as you can see even in your own 
writers, one man being the writer of the whole, but introducing the persons who 
converse. And this the Jews who possessed the books of the prophets did not 
understand, and therefore did not recognise Christ even when He came, but even 
hate us who say that He has come, and who prove that, as was predicted, He was 
crucified by them. 
CHAPTER XXXVII -- UTTERANCES OF THE FATHER. 
And that this too may be clear to you, there were spoken from the person of 
the Father through Isaiah the prophet, the following words: "The ox knoweth his 
owner, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel doth not know, and My people 
hath not understood. Woe, sinful nation, a people full of sins, a wicked seed, 
children that are transgressors, ye have forsaken the Lord." And again 
elsewhere, when the same prophet speaks in like manner from the person of the 
Father, "What is the house that ye will build for Me? saith the Lord. The heaven 
is My throne, and the earth is My footstool." And again, in another place, "Your 
new moons and your sabbaths My soul hateth; and the great day of the fast and of 
ceasing from labour I cannot away with; nor, if ye come to be seen of Me, will I 
hear you: your hands are full of blood; and if ye bring fine flour, incense, it 
is abomination unto Me: the fat of lambs and the blood of bulls I do not desire. 
For who hath required this at your hands? But loose every bond of wickedness, 
tear asunder the tight knots of violent contracts, cover the houseless and naked 
deal thy bread to the hungry." What kind of things are taught through the 
prophets from [the person of] God, you can now perceive. 
CHAPTER XXXVIII -- UTTERANCES OF THE SON. 
And when the Spirit of prophecy speaks from the person of Christ, the 
utterances are of this sort: "I have spread out My hands to a disobedient and 
gainsaying people, to those who walk in a way that is not good." And again: "I 
gave My back to the scourges, and My cheeks to the buffetings; I turned not away 
My face from the shame of spittings; and the Lord was My helper: therefore was I 
not confounded: but I set My face as a firm rock; and I knew that I should not 
be ashamed, for He is near that justifieth Me." And again, when He says, "They 
cast lots upon My vesture, and pierced My hands and My feet. And I lay down and 
slept, and rose again, because the Lord sustained Me." And again, when He says, 
"They spake with their lips, they wagged the head, saying, Let Him deliver 
Himself." And that all these things happened to Christ at the hands of the Jews, 
you can ascertain. For when He was crucified, they did shoot out the lip, and 
wagged their heads, saying, "Let Him who raised the dead save Himself." 
CHAPTER XXXIX -- DIRECT PREDICTIONS BY THE SPIRIT. 
And when the Spirit of prophecy speaks as predicting things that are to come 
to pass, He speaks in this way: "For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the 
word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among the nations, and shall 
rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and 
their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, 
neither shall they learn war any more." And that it did so come to pass, we can 
convince you. For from Jerusalem there went out into the world, men, twelve in 
number, and these illiterate, of no ability in speaking: but by the power of God 
they proclaimed to every race of men that they were sent by Christ to teach to 
all the word of God; and we who formerly used to murder one another do not only 
now refrain from making war upon our enemies, but also, that we may not lie nor 
deceive our examiners, willingly die confessing Christ. For that saying, "The 
tongue has sworn but the mind is unsworn," might be imitated by us in this 
matter. But if the soldiers enrolled by you, and who have taken the military 
oath, prefer their allegiance to their own life, and parents, and country, and 
all kindred, though you can offer them nothing incorruptible, it were verily 
ridiculous if we, who earnestly long for incorruption, should not endure all 
things, in order to obtain what we desire from Him who is able to grant it. 
CHAPTER XL -- CHRIST'S ADVENT FORETOLD, 
And hear how it was foretold concerning those who published His doctrine and 
proclaimed His appearance, the above-mentioned prophet and king speaking thus by 
the Spirit of prophecy "Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night 
showeth knowledge. There is no speech nor language where their voice is not 
heard. Their voice has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends 
of the world. In the sun hath He set His tabernacle, and he as a bridegroom 
going out of his chamber shall rejoice as a giant to run his course." And we 
have thought it right and relevant to mention some other prophetic utterances of 
David besides these; from which you may learn how the Spirit of prophecy exhorts 
men to live, and how He foretold the conspiracy which was formed against Christ 
by Herod the king of the Jews, and the Jews themselves, and Pilate, who was your 
governor among them, with his soldiers; and how He should be believed on by men 
of every race; and how God calls Him His Son, and has declared that He will 
subdue all His enemies under Him; and how the devils, as much as they can, 
strive to escape the power of God the Father and Lord of all, and the power of 
Christ Himself; and how God calls all to repentance before the day of judgment 
comes. These things were uttered thus: "Blessed is the man who hath not walked 
in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the 
seat of the scornful: but his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in His law 
will he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the 
rivers of waters, which shall give his fruit in his season; and his leaf shall 
not wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. The ungodly are not so, but 
are like the chaff which the wind driveth away from the face of the earth. 
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the 
council of the righteous. For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the 
way of the ungodly shall perish. Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine 
new things? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel 
together, against the Lord, and against His Anointed, saying, Let us break their 
bands asunder, and cast their yoke from us. He that dwelleth in the heavens 
shall laugh at them, and the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall He 
speak to them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure. Yet have I 
been set by Him a King on Zion His holy hill, declaring the decree of the Lord. 
The Lord said to Me, Thou art My Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of Me, 
and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts 
of the earth as Thy possession. Thou shall herd them with a rod of iron; as the 
vessels of a potter shalt Thou dash them in pieces. Be wise now, therefore, O ye 
kings; be instructed, all ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and 
rejoice with trembling. Embrace instruction, lest at any time the Lord be angry, 
and ye perish from the right way, when His wrath has been suddenly kindled. 
Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him." 
CHAPTER XLI -- THE CRUCIFIXION PREDICTED. 
And again, in another prophecy, the Spirit of prophecy, through the same 
David, intimated that Christ, after He had been crucified, should reign, and 
spoke as follows: "Sing to the Lord, all the earth, and day by day declare His 
salvation. For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, to be feared above 
all the gods. For all the gods of the nations are idols of devils; but God made 
the heavens. Glory and praise are before His face, strength and glorying are in 
the habitation of His holiness. Give Glory to the Lord, the Father everlasting. 
Receive grace, and enter His presence, and worship in His holy courts. Let all 
the earth fear before His face; let it be established, and not shaken. Let them 
rejoice among the nations. The Lord hath reigned from the tree." 
CHAPTER XLII -- PROPHECY USING THE PAST TENSE. 
But when the Spirit of prophecy speaks of things that are about to come to 
pass as if they had already taken place,--as may be observed even in the 
passages already cited by me,--that this circumstance may afford no excuse to 
readers [for misinterpreting them], we will make even this also quite plain. The 
things which He absolutely knows will take place, He predicts as if already they 
had taken place. And that the utterances must be thus received, you will 
perceive, if you give your attention to them. The words cited above, David 
uttered 1500 years before Christ became a man and was crucified; and no one of 
those who lived before Him, nor yet of His contemporaries, afforded joy to the 
Gentiles by being crucified. But our Jesus Christ, being crucified and dead, 
rose again, and having ascended to heaven, reigned; and by those things which 
were published in His name among all nations by the apostles, there is joy 
afforded to those who expect the immortality promised by Him. 
CHAPTER XLIII--RESPONSIBILITY ASSERTED. 
But lest some suppose, from what has been said by us, that we say that 
whatever happens, happens by a fatal necessity, because it is foretold as known 
beforehand, this too we explain. We have learned from the prophets, and we hold 
it to be true, that punishments, and chastisements, and good rewards, are 
rendered according to the merit of each man's actions. Since if it be not so, 
but all things happen by fate, neither is anything at all in our own power. For 
if it be fated that this man, e.g., be good, and this other evil, neither is the 
former meritorious nor the latter to be blamed. And again, unless the human race 
have the power of avoiding evil and choosing good by free choice, they are not 
accountable for their actions, of whatever kind they be. But that it is by free 
choice they both walk uprightly and stumble, we thus demonstrate. We see the 
same man making a transition to opposite things. Now, if it had been fated that 
he were to be either good or bad, he could never have been capable of both the 
opposites, nor of so many transitions. But not even would some be good and 
others bad, since we thus make fate the cause of evil, and exhibit her as acting 
in opposition to herself; or that which has been already stated would seem to be 
true, that neither virtue nor vice is anything, but that things are only 
reckoned good or evil by opinion; which, as the true word shows, is the greatest 
impiety and wickedness. But this we assert is inevitable fate, that they who 
choose the good have worthy rewards, and they who choose the opposite have their 
merited awards. For not like other things, as trees and quadrupeds, which cannot 
act by choice, did God make man: for neither would he be worthy of reward or 
praise did he not of himself choose the good, but were created for this end; 
nor, if he were evil, would he be worthy of punishment, not being evil of 
himself, but being able to be nothing else than what he was made. 
CHAPTER XLIV -- NOT NULLIFIED BY PROPHECY. 
And the holy Spirit of prophecy taught us this, telling us by Moses that God 
spoke thus to the man first created: "Behold, before thy face are good and evil: 
choose the good." And again, by the other prophet Isaiah, that the following 
utterance was made as if from God the Father and Lord of all: "Wash you, make 
you clean; put away evils from your souls; learn to do well; judge the orphan, 
and plead for the widow: and come and let us reason together, saith the Lord: 
And if your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as wool; and if they be 
red like as crimson, I will make them white as snow. And if ye be willing and 
obey Me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye do not obey Me, the sword 
shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." And that 
expression, "The sword shall devour you," does not mean that the disobedient 
shall be slain by the sword, but the sword of God is fire, of which they who 
choose to do wickedly become the fuel. Wherefore He says, "The sword shall 
devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." And if He had spoken 
concerning a sword that cuts and at once despatches, He would not have said, 
shall devour. And so, too, Plato, when he says, "The blame is his who chooses, 
and God is blameless," took this from the prophet Moses and uttered it. For 
Moses is more ancient than all the Greek writers. And whatever both philosophers 
and poets have said concerning the immortality of the soul, or punishments after 
death, or contemplation of things heavenly, or doctrines of the like kind, they 
have received such suggestions from the prophets as have enabled them to 
understand and interpret these things. And hence there seem to be seeds of truth 
among all men; but they are charged with not accurately understanding [the 
truth] when they assert contradictories. So that what we say about future events 
being foretold, we do not say it as if they came about by a fatal necessity; but 
God foreknowing all that shall be done by all men, and it being His decree that 
the future actions of men shall all be recompensed according to their several 
value, He foretells by the Spirit of prophecy that He will bestow meet rewards 
according to the merit of the actions done, always urging the human race to 
effort and recollection, showing that He cares and provides for men. But by the 
agency of the devils death has been decreed against those who read the books of 
Hystaspes, or of the Sibyl, or of the prophets, that through fear they may 
prevent men who read them from receiving the knowledge of the good, and may 
retain them in slavery to themselves; which, however, they could not always 
effect. For not only do we fearlessly read them, but, as you see, bring them for 
your inspection, knowing that their contents will be pleasing to all. And if we 
persuade even a few, our gain will be very great; for, as good husbandmen, we 
shall receive the reward from the Master. 
CHAPTER XLV -- CHRIST'S SESSION IN HEAVEN FORETOLD. 
And that God the Father of all would bring Christ to heaven after He had 
raised Him from the dead, and would keep Him there until He has subdued His 
enemies the devils, and until the number of those who are foreknown by Him as 
good and virtuous is complete, on whose account He has still delayed the 
consummation--hear what was said by the prophet David. These are his words: "The 
Lord said unto My Lord, Sit Thou at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies 
Thy footstool. The Lord shall send to Thee the rod of power out of Jerusalem; 
and rule Thou in the midst of Thine enemies. With Thee is the government in the 
day of Thy power, in the beauties of Thy saints: from the womb of morning hare I 
begotten Thee." That which he says, "He shall send to Thee the rod of power out 
of Jerusalem," is predictive of the mighty, word, which His apostles, going 
forth from Jerusalem, preached everywhere; and though death is decreed against 
those who teach or at all confess the name of Christ, we everywhere both embrace 
and teach it. And if you also read these words in a hostile spirit, ye can do no 
more, as I said before, than kill us; which indeed does no harm to us, but to 
you and all who unjustly hate us, and do not repent, brings eternal punishment 
by tire. 
CHAPTER XLVI -- THE WORD IN THE WORLD BEFORE CHRIST. 
But lest some should, without reason, and for the perversion of what we 
teach, maintain that we say that Christ was born one hundred and fifty years ago 
under Cyrenius, and subsequently, in the time of Pontius Pilate, taught what we 
say He taught; and should cry out against us as though all men who were born 
before Him were irresponsible--let us anticipate and solve the difficulty. We 
have been taught that Christ is the first-born of God, and we have declared 
above that He is the Word of whom every race of men were partakers; and those 
who lived reasonably are Christians, even though they have been thought 
atheists; as, among the Greeks, Socrates and Heraclitus, and men like them; and 
among the barbarians, Abraham, and Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael, and Elias, 
and many others whose actions and names we now decline to recount, because we 
know it would be tedious. So that even they who lived before Christ, and lived 
without reason, were wicked and hostile to Christ, and slew those who lived 
reasonably. But who, through the power of the Word, according to the will of God 
the Father and Lord of all, He was born of a virgin as a man, and was named 
Jesus, and was crucified, and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, an 
intelligent man will be able to comprehend from what has been already so largely 
said. And we, since the proof of this subject is less needful now, will pass for 
the present to the proof of those things which are urgent. 
CHAPTER XLVII -- DESOLATION OF JUDAEA FORETOLD. 
That the land of the Jews, then, was to be laid waste, hear what was said by 
the Spirit of prophecy. And the words were spoken as if from the person of the 
people wondering at what had happened. They are these: "Sion is a wilderness, 
Jerusalem a desolation. The house of our sanctuary has become a curse, and the 
glory which our fathers blessed is burned up with fire, and all its glorious 
things are laid waste: and Thou refrainest Thyself at these things, and hast 
held Thy peace, and hast humbled us very sore." And ye are convinced that 
Jerusalem has been laid waste, as was predicted. And concerning its desolation, 
and that no one should be permitted to inhabit it, there was the following 
prophecy by Isaiah: "Their land is desolate, their enemies consume it before 
them, and none of them shall dwell therein." And that it is guarded by you lest 
any one dwell in it, and that death is decreed against a Jew apprehended 
entering it, you know very well. 
CHAPTER XLVIII -- CHRIST'S WORK AND DEATH FORE- TOLD. 
And that it was predicted that our Christ should heal all diseases and raise 
the dead, hear what was said. There are these words: "At His coming the lame 
shall leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerer shall be clear speaking: 
the blind shall see, and the lepers shall be cleansed; and the dead shall rise, 
and walk about." And that He did those things, you can learn from the Acts of 
Pontius Pilate. And how it was predicted by the Spirit of prophecy that He and 
those who hoped in Him should be slain, hear what was said by Isaiah. These are 
the words: "Behold now the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; 
and just men are taken away, and no man considereth. From the presence of 
wickedness is the righteous man taken, and his burial shall be in peace: he is 
taken from our midst." 
CHAPTER XLIX -- HIS REJECTION BY THE JEWS FORE- TOLD. 
And again, how it was said by the same Isaiah, that the Gentile nations who 
were not looking for Him should worship Him, but the Jews who always expected 
Him should not recognize Him when He came. And the words are spoken as from the 
person of Christ; and they are these "I was manifest to them that asked not for 
Me; I was found of them that sought Me not: I said, Behold Me, to a nation that 
called not on My name. I spread out My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying 
people, to those who walked in a way that is not good, but follow after their 
own sins; a people that provoketh Me to anger to My face." For the Jews having 
the prophecies, and being always in expectation of the Christ to come, did not 
recognise Him; and not only so, but even treated Him shamefully. But the 
Gentiles, who had never heard anything about Christ, until the apostles set out 
from Jerusalem and preached concerning Him, and gave them the prophecies, were 
filled with joy and faith, and cast away their idols, and dedicated themselves 
to the Unbegotten God through Christ. And that it was foreknown that these 
infamous things should be uttered against those who confessed Christ, and that 
those who slandered Him, and said that it was well to preserve the ancient 
customs, should be miserable, hear what was briefly said by Isaiah; it is this: 
"Woe unto them that call sweet bitter, and bitter sweet." 
CHAPTER L -- HIS HUMILIATION PREDICTED. 
But that, having become man for our sakes, He endured to suffer and to be 
dishonoured, and that He shall come again with glory, hear the prophecies which 
relate to this; they are these: "Because they delivered His soul unto death, and 
He was numbered with the transgressors, He has borne the sin of many, and shall 
make intercession for the transgressors. For, behold, My Servant shall deal 
prudently, and shall be exalted, and shall be greatly extolled. As many were 
astonished at Thee, so marred shall Thy form be before men, and so hidden from 
them Thy glory; so shall many nations wonder, and the kings shall shut their 
mouths at Him. For they to whom it was not told concerning Him, and they who 
have not heard, shall understand. O Lord, who hath believed our report? and to 
whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have declared before Him as a child, as 
a root in a dry ground. He had no form, nor glory; and we saw Him, and there was 
no form nor comeliness: but His form was dishonoured and marred more than the 
sons of men. A man under the stroke, and knowing how to bear infirmity, because 
His face was turned away: He was despised, and of no reputation. It is He who 
bears our sins, and is afflicted for us; yet we did esteem Him smitten, 
stricken, and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was 
bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of peace was upon Him, by His 
stripes we are healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray; every man has 
wandered in his own way. And He delivered Him for our sins; and He opened not 
His mouth for all His affliction. He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, 
and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth. In His 
humiliation, His judgment was taken away." Accordingly, after He was crucified, 
even all His acquaintances forsook Him, having denied Him; and afterwards, when 
He had risen from the dead and appeared to them, and had taught them to read the 
prophecies in which all these things were foretold as coming to pass, and when 
they had seen Him ascending into heaven, and had believed, and had received 
power sent thence by Him upon them, and went to every race of men, they taught 
these things, and were called apostles. 
CHAPTER LI -- THE MAJESTY OF CHRIST. 
And that the Spirit of prophecy might signify to us that He who suffers these 
things has an ineffable origin, and rules His enemies, He spake thus: "His 
generation who shall declare? because His life is cut off from the earth: for 
their transgressions He comes to death. And I will give the wicked for His 
burial, and the rich for His death; because He did no violence, neither was any 
deceit in His mouth. And the Lord is pleased to cleanse Him from the stripe. If 
He be given for sin, your soul shall see His seed prolonged in days. And the 
Lord is pleased to deliver His soul from grief, to show Him light, and to form 
Him with knowledge, to justify the righteous who richly serveth many. And He 
shall bear our iniquities. Therefore He shall inherit many, and He shall divide 
the spoil of the strong; because His soul was delivered to death: and He was 
numbered with the transgressors; and He bare the sins of many, and He was 
delivered up for their transgressions." Hear, too, how He was to ascend into 
heaven according to prophecy. It was thus spoken: "Lift up the gates of heaven; 
be ye opened, that the King of glory may come in. Who is this King of glory? The 
Lord, strong and mighty." And how also He should come again out of heaven with 
glory, hear what was spoken in reference to this by the prophet Jeremiah. His 
words are: "Behold, as the Son of man He cometh in the clouds of heaven, and His 
angels with Him." 
CHAPTER LII -- CERTAIN FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY. 
Since, then, we prove that all things which have already happened had been 
predicted by the prophets before they came to pass, we must necessarily believe 
also that those things which are in like manner predicted, but are yet to come 
to pass, shall certainly happen. For as the things which have already taken 
place came to pass when foretold, and even though unknown, so shall the things 
that remain, even though they be unknown and disbelieved, yet come to pass. For 
the prophets have proclaimed two advents of His: the one, that which is already 
past, when He came as a dishonoured and suffering Man; but the second, when, 
according to prophecy, He shall come from heaven with glory, accompanied by His 
angelic host, when also He shall raise the bodies of all men who have lived, and 
shall clothe those of the worthy with immortality, and shall send those of the 
wicked, endued with eternal sensibility, into everlasting fire with the wicked 
devils. And that these things also have been foretold as yet to be, we will 
prove. By Ezekiel the prophet it was said: "Joint shall be joined to joint, and 
bone to bone, and flesh shall grow again; and every knee shall bow to the Lord, 
and every tongue shall confess Him." And in what kind of sensation and 
punishment the wicked are to be, hear from what was said in like manner with 
reference to this; it is as follows: "Their worm shall not rest, and their fire 
shall not be quenched;" and then shall they repent, when it profits them not. 
And what the people of the Jews shall say and do, when they see Him coming in 
glory, has been thus predicted by Zechariah the prophet: "I will command the 
four winds to gather the scattered children; I will command the north wind to 
bring them, and the south wind, that it keep not back. And then in Jerusalem 
there shall be great lamentation, not the lamentation of mouths or of lips, but 
the lamentation of the heart; and they shall rend not their garments, but their 
hearts. Tribe by tribe they shall mourn, and then they shall look on Him whom 
they have pierced; and they shall say, Why, O Lord, hast Thou made us to err 
from Thy way? The glory which our fathers blessed, has for us been turned into 
shame." 
CHAPTER LIII -- SUMMARY OF THE PROPHECIES. 
Though we could bring forward many other prophecies, we forbear, judging 
these sufficient for the persuasion of those who have ears to hear and 
understand; and considering also that those persons are able to see that we do 
not make mere assertions without being able to produce proof, like those fables 
that are told of the so-called sons of Jupiter. For with what reason should we 
believe of a crucified man that He is the first-born of the unbegotten God, and 
Himself will pass judgment on the whole human race, unless we had found 
testimonies concerning Him published before He came and was born as man, and 
unless we saw that things had happened accordingly--the devastation of the land 
of the Jews, and men of every race persuaded by His teaching through the 
apostles, and rejecting their old habits, in which, being deceived, they had 
their conversation; yea, seeing ourselves too, and knowing that the Christians 
from among the Gentiles are both more numerous and more true than those from 
among the Jews and Samaritans? For all the other human races are called Gentiles 
by the Spirit of prophecy; but the Jewish and Samaritan races are called the 
tribe of Israel, and the house of Jacob. And the prophecy in which it was 
predicted that there should be more believers from the Gentiles than from the 
Jews and Samaritans, we will produce: it ran thus: "Rejoice, O barren, thou that 
dost not bear; break forth and shout, thou that dost not travail, because many 
more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath an husband." For all 
the Gentiles were "desolate" of the true God, serving the works of their hands; 
but the Jews and Samaritans, having the word of God delivered to them by the 
prophets, and always expecting the Christ, did not recognise Him when He came, 
except some few, of whom the Spirit of prophecy by Isaiah had predicted that 
they should be saved. He spoke as from their person: "Except the Lord had left 
us a seed, we should have been as Sodom and Gomorrah." For Sodom and Gomorrah 
are related by Moses to have been cities of ungodly men, which God burned with 
fire and brimstone, and overthrew, no one of their inhabitants being saved 
except a certain stranger, a Chaldaean by birth, whose name was Lot; with whom 
also his daughters were rescued. And those who care may yet see their whole 
country desolate and burned, and remaining barren. And to show how those from 
among the Gentiles were foretold as more true and more believing, we will cite 
what was said by Isaiah the prophet; for he spoke as follows "Israel is 
uncircumcised in heart, but the Gentiles are uncircumcised in the flesh." So 
many things therefore, as these, when they are seen with the eye, are enough to 
produce conviction and belief in those who embrace the truth, and are not 
bigoted in their opinions, nor are governed by their passions. 
CHAPTER LIV -- ORIGIN OF HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY. 
But those who hand down the myths which the poets have made, adduce no proof 
to the youths who learn them; and we proceed to demonstrate that they have been 
uttered by the influence of the wicked demons, to deceive and lead astray the 
human race. For having heard it proclaimed through the prophets that the Christ 
was to come, and that the ungodly among men were to be punished by fire, they 
put forward many to be called sons of Jupiter, under the impression that they 
would be able to produce in men the idea that the things which were said with 
regard to Christ were mere marvellous tales, like the things which were said by 
the poets. And these things were said both among the Greeks and among all 
nations where they [the demons] heard the prophets foretelling that Christ would 
specially be believed in; but that in hearing what was said by the prophets they 
did not accurately understand it, but imitated what was said of our Christ, like 
men who are in error, we will make plain. The prophet Moses, then, Was, as we 
have already said, older than all writers; and by him, as we have also said 
before, it was thus predicted: "There shall not fail a prince from Judah, nor a 
lawgiver from between his feet, until He come for whom it is reserved; and He 
shall be the desire of the Gentiles, binding His foal to the vine, washing His 
robe in the blood of the grape." The devils, accordingly, when they heard these 
prophetic words, said that Bacchus was the son of Jupiter, and gave out that he 
was the discoverer of the vine, and they number wine [or, the ass] among his 
mysteries; and they taught that, having been torn in pieces, he ascended into 
heaven. And because in the prophecy of Moses it had not been expressly intimated 
whether He who was to come was the Son of God, and whether He would, riding on 
the foal, remain on earth or ascend into heaven, and because the name of "foal" 
could mean either the foal of an ass or the foal of a horse, they, not knowing 
whether He who was foretold would bring the foal of an ass or of a horse as the 
sign of His coming, nor whether He was the Son of God, as we said above, or of 
man, gave out that Bellerophon, a man born of man, himself ascended to heaven on 
his horse Pegasus. And when they heard it said by the other prophet Isaiah, that 
He should be born of a virgin, and by His own means ascend into heaven, they 
pretended that Perseus was spoken of. And when they knew what was said, as has 
been cited above, in the prophecies written aforetime, "Strong as a giant to run 
his course," they said that Hercules was strong, and had journeyed over the 
whole earth. And when, again, they learned that it had been foretold that He 
should heal every sickness, and raise the dead, they produced Aesculapius. 
CHAPTER LV -- SYMBOLS OF THE CROSS. 
But in no instance, not even in any of those called sons of Jupiter, did they 
imitate the being crucified; for it was not understood by them, all the things 
said of it having been put symbolically. And this, as the prophet foretold, is 
the greatest symbol of His power and role; as is also proved by the things which 
fall under our observation. For consider all the things in the world, whether 
without this form they could be administered or have any community. For the sea 
is not traversed except that trophy which is called a sail abide safe in the 
ship; and the earth is not ploughed without it: diggers and mechanics do not 
their work, except with tools which have this shape. And the human form differs 
from that of the irrational animals in nothing else than in its being erect and 
having the hands extended, and having on the face extending from the forehead 
what is called the nose, through which there is respiration for the living 
creature; and this shows no other form than that of the cross. And so it was 
said by the prophet, "The breath before our face is the Lord Christ." And the 
power of this form is shown by your own symbols on what are called "vexilla" 
[banners] and trophies, with which all your state possessions are made, using 
these as the insignia of your power and government, even though you do so 
unwittingly. And with this form you consecrate the images of your emperors when 
they die, and you name them gods by inscriptions. Since, therefore, we have 
urged you both by reason and by an evident form, and to the utmost of our 
ability, we know that now we are blameless even though you disbelieve; for our 
part is done and finished. 
CHAPTER LVI -- THE DEMONS STILL MISLEAD MEN. 
But the evil spirits were not satisfied with saying, before Christ's 
appearance, that those who were said to be sons of Jupiter were born of him; but 
after He had appeared, and been born among men, and when they learned how He had 
been foretold by the prophets, and knew that He should be believed on and looked 
for by every nation, they again, as was said above, put forward other men, the 
Samaritans Simon and Menander, who did many mighty works by magic, and deceived 
many, and still keep them deceived. For even among yourselves, as we said 
before, Simon was in the royal city Rome in the reign of Claudius Caesar, and so 
greatly astonished the sacred senate and people of the Romans, that he was 
considered a god, and honoured, like the others whom you honour as gods, with a 
statue. Wherefore we pray that the sacred senate and your people may, along with 
yourselves, be arbiters of this our memorial, in order that if any one be 
entangled by that man's doctrines, he may learn the truth, and so be able to 
escape error; and as for the statue, if you please, destroy it. 
CHAPTER LVII -- AND CAUSE PERSECUTION. 
Nor can the devils persuade men that there will be no conflagration for the 
punishment of the wicked; as they were unable to effect that Christ should be 
hidden after He came. But this only can they effect, that they who live 
irrationally, and were brought up licentiously in wicked customs, and are 
prejudiced in their own opinions, should kill and hate us; whom we not only do 
not hate, but, as is proved, pity and endeavour to lead to repentance. For we do 
not fear death, since it is acknowledged we must surely die; and there is 
nothing new, but all things continue the same in this administration of things; 
and if satiety overtakes those who enjoy even one year of these things, they 
ought to give heed to our doctrines, that they may live eternally free both from 
suffering and from want. But if they believe that there is nothing after death, 
but declare that those who die pass into insensibility, then they become our 
benefactors when they set us free from sufferings and necessities of this life, 
and prove themselves to be wicked, and inhuman, and bigoted. For they kill us 
with no intention of delivering us, but cut us off that we may be deprived of 
life and pleasure. 
CHAPTER LVIII -- AND RAISE UP HERETICS. 
And, as we said before, the devils put forward Marcion of Pontus, who is even 
now teaching men to deny that God is the maker of all things in heaven and on 
earth, and that the Christ predicted by the prophets is His Son, and preaches 
another god besides the Creator of all, and likewise another son. And this man 
many have believed, as if he alone knew the truth, and laugh at us, though they 
have no proof of what they say, but are carried away irrationally as lambs by a 
wolf, and become the prey of atheistical doctrines, and of devils. For they who 
are called devils attempt nothing else than to seduce men from God who made 
them, and from Christ His first-begotten; and those who are unable to raise 
themselves above the earth they have riveted, and do now rivet, to things 
earthly, and to the works of their own hands; but those who devote themselves to 
the contemplation of things divine, they secretly beat back; and if they have 
not a wise sober-mindedness, and a pure and passionless life, they drive them 
into godlessness. 
CHAPTER LIX -- PLATO'S OBLIGATION TO MOSES. 
And that you may learn that it was from our teachers--we mean the account 
given through the prophets--that Plato borrowed his statement that God, having 
altered matter which was shapeless, made the world, hear the very words spoken 
through Moses, who, as above shown, was the first prophet, and of greater 
antiquity than the Greek writers; and through whom the Spirit of prophecy, 
signifying how and from what materials God at first formed the world, spake 
thus: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was 
invisible and unfurnished, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the 
Spirit of God moved over the waters. And God said, Let there be light; and it 
was so." So that both Plato and they who agree with him, and we ourselves, have 
learned, and you also can be convinced, that by the word of God the whole world 
was made out of the substance spoken of before by Moses. And that which the 
poets call Erebus, we know was spoken of formerly by Moses. 
CHAPTER LX -- PLATO'S DOCTRINE OF THE CROSS. 
And the physiological discussion concerning the Son of God in the Timoeus of 
Plato, where he says, "He placed him crosswise in the universe," he borrowed in 
like manner from Moses; for in the writings of Moses it is related how at that 
time, when the Israelites went out of Egypt and were in the wilderness, they 
fell in with poisonous beasts, both vipers and asps, and every kind of serpent, 
which slew the people; and that Moses, by the inspiration and influence of God, 
took brass, and made it into the figure of a cross, and set it in the holy 
tabernacle, and said to the people, "If ye look to this figure, and believe, ye 
shall be saved thereby." And when this was done, it is recorded that the 
serpents died, and it is handed down that the people thus escaped death. Which 
things Plato reading, and not accurately understanding, and not apprehending 
that it was the figure of the cross, but taking it to be a placing crosswise, he 
said that the power next to the first God was placed crosswise in the universe. 
And as to his speaking of a third, he did this because he read, as we said 
above, that which was spoken by Moses, "that the Spirit of God moved over the 
waters." For he gives the second place to the Logos which is with God, who he 
said was placed crosswise in the universe; and the third place to the Spirit who 
was said to be borne upon the water, saying, "And the third around the third." 
And hear how the Spirit of prophecy signified through Moses that there should be 
a conflagration. He spoke thus: "Everlasting fire shall descend, and shall 
devour to the pit beneath." It is not, then, that we hold the same opinions as 
others, but that all speak in imitation of ours. Among us these things can be 
heard and learned from persons who do not even know the forms of the letters, 
who are uneducated and barbarous in speech, though wise and believing in mind; 
some, indeed, even maimed and deprived of eyesight; so that you may understand 
that these things are not the effect of human wisdom, but are uttered by the 
power of God. 
CHAPTER LXI -- CHRISTIAN BAPTISM. 
I will also relate the manner in which we dedicated ourselves to God when we 
had been made new through Christ; lest, if we omit this, we seem to be unfair in 
the explanation we are making. As many as are persuaded and believe that what we 
teach and say is true, and undertake to be able to live accordingly, are 
instructed to pray and to entreat God with fasting, for the remission of their 
sins that are past, we praying and fasting with them. Then they are brought by 
us where there is water, and are regenerated in the same manner in which we were 
ourselves regenerated. For, in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the 
universe, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, they then 
receive the washing with water. For Christ also said, "Except ye be born again, 
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Now, that it is impossible for 
those who have once been born to enter into their mothers' wombs, is manifest to 
all. And how those who have sinned and repent shall escape their sins, is 
declared by Esaias the prophet, as I wrote above; he thus speaks: "Wash you, 
make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from your souls; learn to do 
well; judge the fatherless, and plead for the widow: and come and let us reason 
together, saith the Lord. And though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them 
white like wool; and though they be as crimson, I will make them white as snow. 
But if ye refuse and rebel, the sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the 
Lord hath spoken it." 
And for this [rite] we have learned from the apostles this reason. Since at 
our birth we were born without our own knowledge or choice, by our parents 
coming together, and were brought up in bad habits and wicked training; in order 
that we may not remain the children of necessity and of ignorance, but may 
become the children of choice and knowledge, and may obtain in the water the 
remission of sins formerly committed, there is pronounced over him who chooses 
to be born again, and has repented of his sins, the name of God the Father and 
Lord of the universe; he who leads to the layer the person that is to be washed 
calling him by this name alone. For no one can utter the name of the ineffable 
God; and if any one dare to say that there is a name, he raves with a hopeless 
madness. And this washing is called illumination, because they who learn these 
things are illuminated in their understandings. And in the name of Jesus Christ, 
who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and in the name of the Holy Ghost, who 
through the prophets foretold all things about Jesus, he who is illuminated is 
washed. 
CHAPTER LXII -- ITS IMITATION BY DEMONS. 
And the devils, indeed, having heard this washing published by the prophet, 
instigated those who enter their temples, and are about to approach them with 
libations and burnt-offerings, also to sprinkle themselves; and they cause them 
also to wash themselves entirely, as they depart [from the sacrifice], before 
they enter into the shrines in which their images are set. And the command, too, 
given by the priests to those who enter and worship in the temples, that they 
take off their shoes, the devils, learning what happened to the above-mentioned 
prophet Moses, have given in imitation of these things. For at that juncture, 
when Moses was ordered to go down into Egypt and lead out the people of the 
Israelites who were there, and while he was tending the flocks of his maternal 
uncle in the land of Arabia, our Christ conversed with him under the appearance 
of fire from a bush, and said, "Put off thy shoes, and draw near and hear." And 
he, when he had put off his shoes and drawn near, heard that he was to go down 
into Egypt and lead out the people of the Israelites there; and he received 
mighty power from Christ, who spoke to him in the appearance of fire, and went 
down and led out the people, having done great and marvellous things; which, if 
you desire to know, you will learn them accurately from his writings. 
CHAPTER LXIII -- HOW GOD APPEARED TO MOSES. 
And all the Jews even now teach that the nameless God spake to Moses; whence 
the Spirit of prophecy, accusing them by Isaiah the prophet mentioned above, 
said "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but israel doth 
not know Me, and My people do not understand." And Jesus the Christ, because the 
Jews knew not what the Father was, and what the Son, in like manner accused 
them; and Himself said, "No one knoweth the Father, but the Son; nor the Son, 
but the Father, and they to whom the Son revealeth Him." Now the Word of God is 
His Son, as we have before said. And He is called Angel and Apostle; for He 
declares whatever we ought to know, and is sent forth to declare whatever is 
revealed; as our Lord Himself says, "He that heareth Me, heareth Him that sent 
Me." From the writings of Moses also this will be manifest; for thus it is 
written in them, "And the Angel of God spake to Moses, in a flame of fire out of 
the bush, and said, I am that I am, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the 
God of Jacob, the God of thy fathers; go down into Egypt, and bring forth My 
people." And if you wish to learn what follows, you can do so from the same 
writings; for it is impossible to relate the whole here. But so much is written 
for the sake of proving that Jesus the Christ is the Son of God and His Apostle, 
being of old the Word, and appearing sometimes in the form of fire, and 
sometimes in the likeness of angels; but now, by the will of God, having become 
man for the human race, He endured all the sufferings which the devils 
instigated the senseless Jews to inflict upon Him; who, though they have it 
expressly affirmed in the writings of Moses, "And the angel of God spake to 
Moses in a flame of fire in a bush, and said, I am that I am, the God of 
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob," yet maintain that He who 
said this was the Father and Creator of the universe. Whence also the Spirit of 
prophecy rebukes them, and says, "Israel doth not know Me, my people have not 
understood Me." And again, Jesus, as we have already shown, while He was with 
them, said, "No one knoweth the Father, but the Son; nor the Son but the Father, 
and those to whom the Son will reveal Him." The Jews, accordingly, being 
throughout of opinion that it was the Father of the universe who spake to Moses, 
though He who spake to him was indeed the Son of God, who is called both Angel 
and Apostle, are justly charged, both by the Spirit of prophecy and by Christ 
Himself, with knowing neither the Father nor the Son. For they who affirm that 
the Son is the Father, are proved neither to have become acquainted with the 
Father, nor to know that the Father of the universe has a Son; who also, being 
the first-begotten Word of God, is even God. And of old He appeared in the shape 
of fire and in the likeness of an angel to Moses and to the other prophets; but 
now in the times of your reign, having, as we before said, become Man by a 
virgin, according to the counsel of the Father, for the salvation of those who 
believe on Him, He endured both to be set at nought and to suffer, that by dying 
and rising again He might conquer death. And that which was said out of the bush 
to Moses, "I am that I am, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God 
of Jacob, and the God of your fathers," this signified that they, even though 
dead, are let in existence, and are men belonging to Christ Himself. For they 
were the first of all men to busy themselves in the search after God; Abraham 
being the father of Isaac, and Isaac of Jacob, as Moses wrote. 
CHAPTER LXIV -- FURTHER MISREPRESENTATIONS OF THE TRUTH. 
From what has been already said, you can understand how the devils, in 
imitation of what was said by Moses, asserted that Proserpine was the daughter 
of Jupiter, and instigated the people to set up an image of her under the name 
of Kore [Cora, i.e., the maiden or daughter] at the spring-heads. For, as we 
wrote above, Moses said, "In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth. 
And the earth was without form and unfurnished: and the Spirit of God moved upon 
the face of the waters." In imitation, therefore, of what is here said of the 
Spirit of God moving on the waters, they said that Proserpine [or Coral was the 
daughter of Jupiter. And in like manner also they craftily feigned that Minerva 
was the daughter of Jupiter, not by sexual union, but, knowing that God 
conceived and made the world by the Word, they say that Minerva is the first 
conception [ennoia]; which we consider to be very absurd, 
bringing forward the form of the conception in a female shape. And in like 
manner the actions of those others who are called sons of Jupiter sufficiently 
condemn them. 
CHAPTER LXV -- ADMINISTRATION OF THE SACRAMENTS. 
But we, after we have thus washed him who has been convinced and has assented 
to our teaching, bring him to the place where those who are called brethren are 
assembled, in order that we may offer hearty prayers in common for ourselves and 
for the baptized [illuminated] person, and for all others in every place, that 
we may be counted worthy, now that we have learned the truth, by our works also 
to be found good citizens and keepers of the commandments, so that we may be 
saved with an everlasting salvation. Having ended the prayers, we salute one 
another with a kiss. There is then brought to the president of the brethren 
bread and a cup of wine mixed with water; and he taking them, gives praise and 
glory to the Father of the universe, through the name of the Son and of the Holy 
Ghost, and offers thanks at considerable length for our being counted worthy to 
receive these things at His hands. And when he has concluded the prayers and 
thanksgivings, all the people present express their assent by saying Amen. This 
word Amen answers in the Hebrew language to genoito [so be it]. 
And when the president has given thanks, and all the people have expressed their 
assent, those who are called by us deacons give to each of those present to 
partake of the bread and wine mixed with water over which the thanksgiving was 
pronounced, and to those who are absent they carry away a portion. 
CHAPTER LXVI -- OF THE EUCHARIST. 
And this food is called among us Eukaristia [the Eucharist], 
of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things 
which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for 
the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has 
enjoined. For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in 
like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh by the Word of 
God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught 
that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our 
blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that 
Jesus who was made flesh. For the apostles, in the memoirs composed by them, 
which are called Gospels, have thus delivered unto us what was enjoined upon 
them; that Jesus took bread, and when He had given thanks, said, "This do ye in 
remembrance of Me, this is My body;" and that, after the same manner, having 
taken the cup and given thanks, He said, "This is My blood;" and gave it to them 
alone. Which the wicked devils have imitated in the mysteries of Mithras, 
commanding the same thing to be done. For, that bread and a cup of water are 
placed with certain incantations in the mystic rites of one who is being 
initiated, you either know or can learn. 
CHAPTER LXVII -- WEEKLY WORSHIP OF THE CHRIS- TIANS. 
And we afterwards continually remind each other of these things. And the 
wealthy among us help the needy; and we always keep together; and for all things 
wherewith we are supplied, we bless the Maker of all through His Son Jesus 
Christ, and through the Holy Ghost. And on the day called Sunday, all who live 
in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the 
apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; 
then, when the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs, and exhorts 
to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, 
as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are 
brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, 
according to his ability, and the people assent, saying Amen; and there is a 
distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been 
given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they 
who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is 
collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows 
and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who 
are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of 
all who are in need. But Sunday is the day on which we all hold our common 
assembly, because it is the first day on which God, having wrought a change in 
the darkness and matter, made the world; and Jesus Christ our Saviour on the 
same day rose from the dead. For He was crucified on the day before that of 
Saturn (Saturday); and on the day after that of Saturn, which is the day of the 
Sun, having appeared to His apostles and disciples, He taught them these things, 
which we have submitted to you also for your consideration. 
CHAPTER LXVIII -- CONCLUSION. 
And if these things seem to you to be reasonable and true, honour them; but 
if they seem nonsensical, despise them as nonsense, and do not decree death 
against those who have done no wrong, as you would against enemies. For we 
forewarn you, that you shall not escape the coming judgment of God, if you 
continue in your injustice; and we ourselves will invite you to do that which is 
pleasing to God. And though from the letter of the greatest and most illustrious 
Emperor Adrian, your father, we could demand that you order judgment to be given 
as we have desired, yet we have made this appeal and explanation, not on the 
ground of Adrian's decision, but because we know that what we ask is just. And 
we have subjoined the copy of Adrian's epistle, that you may know that we are 
speaking truly about this. And the following is the copy:-- EPISTLE OF ADRIAN IN 
BEHALF OF THE CHRISTIANS. 
I have received the letter addressed to me by your predecessor Serenius 
Granianus, a most illustrious man; and this communication I am unwilling to pass 
over in silence, lest innocent persons be disturbed, and occasion be given to 
the informers for practising villany. Accordingly, if the inhabitants of your 
province will so far sustain this petition of theirs as to accuse the Christians 
in some court of law, I do not prohibit them from doing so. But I will not 
suffer them to make use of mere entreaties and outcries. For it is far more 
just, if any one desires to make an accusation, that you give judgment upon it. 
If, therefore, any one makes the accusation, and furnishes proof that the said 
men do anything contrary to the laws, you shall adjudge punishments in 
proportion to the offences. And this, by Hercules; you shall give special heed 
to, that if any man shall, through mere calumny, bring an accusation against any 
of these persons, you shall award to him more severe punishments in proportion 
to his wickedness. EPISTLE OF ANTONINUS TO THE COMMON ASSEMBLY OF ASIA. 
The Emperor Caesar Titus AElius Adrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius, Supreme 
Pontiff, in the fifteenth year of his tribuneship, Consul for the third time, 
Father of the fatherland, to the Common Assembly of Asia, greeting: I should 
have thought that the gods themselves would see to it that such offenders should 
not escape. For if they had the power, they themselves would much rather punish 
those who refuse to worship them; but it is you who bring trouble on these 
persons, and accuse as the opinion of atheists that which they hold, and lay to 
their charge certain other things which we are unable to prove. But it would be 
advantageous to them that they should be thought to die for that of which they 
are accused, and they conquer you by being lavish of their lives rather than 
yield that obedience which you require of them. And regarding the earthquakes 
which have already happened and are now occurring, it is not seemly that you 
remind us of them, losing heart whenever they occur, and thus set your conduct 
in contrast with that of these men; for they have much greater confidence 
towards God than you yourselves have. And you, indeed, seem at such times to 
ignore the gods, and you neglect the temples, and make no recognition of the 
worship of God. And hence you are jealous of those who do serve Him, and 
persecute them to the death. Concerning such persons, some others also of the 
governors of provinces wrote to my most divine father; to whom he replied that 
they should not at all disturb such persons, unless they were found to be 
attempting anything against the Roman government. And to myself many have sent 
intimations regarding such persons, to whom I also replied in pursuance of my 
father's judgment. But if any one has a matter to bring against any person of 
this class, merely as such a person, let the accused be acquitted of the charge, 
even though he should be found to be such an one; but let the accuser he 
amenable to justice. EPISTLE OF MARCUS AURELIUS TO THE SENATE, IN WHICH HE 
TESTIFIES THAT THE CHRISTIANS WERE THE CAUSE OF HIS VICTORY. 
The Emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, Germanicus, Parthicus, 
Sarmaticus, to the People of Rome, and to the sacred Senate greeting: I 
explained to you my grand design, and what advantages I gained on the confines 
of Germany, with much labour and suffering, in consequence of the circumstance 
that I was surrounded by the enemy; I myself being shut up in Carnuntum by 
seventy-four cohorts, nine miles off. And the enemy being at hand, the scouts 
pointed out to us, and our general Pompeianus showed us that there was close on 
us a mass of a mixed multitude of 977,000 men, which indeed we saw; and I was 
shut up by this vast host, having with me only a battalion composed of the 
first, tenth, double and marine legions. Having then examined my own position, 
and my host, with respect to the vast mass of barbarians and of the enemy, I 
quickly betook myself to prayer to the gods of my country. But being disregarded 
by them, I summoned those who among us go by the name of Christians. And having 
made inquiry, I discovered a great number and vast host of them, and raged 
against them, which was by no means becoming; for afterwards I learned their 
power. Wherefore they began the battle, not by preparing weapons, nor arms, nor 
bugles; for such preparation is hateful to them, on account of the God they bear 
about in their conscience. Therefore it is probable that those whom we suppose 
to be atheists, have God as their ruling power entrenched in their conscience. 
For having cast themselves on the ground, they prayed not only for me, but also 
for the whole army as it stood, that they might be delivered from the present 
thirst and famine. For during five days we had got no water, because there was 
none; for we were in the heart of Germany, and in the enemy's territory. And 
simultaneously with their casting themselves on the ground, and praying to God 
(a God of whom I am ignorant), water poured from heaven, upon us most 
refreshingly cool, but upon the enemies of Rome a withering hail. And 
immediately we recognised the presence of God following on the prayer--a God 
unconquerable and indestructible. Founding upon this, then, let us pardon such 
as are Christians, lest they pray for and obtain such a weapon against 
ourselves. And I counsel that no such person be accused on the ground of his 
being a Christian. But if any one be found laying to the charge of a Christian 
that he is a Christian, I desire that it be made manifest that he who is accused 
as a Christian, and acknowledges that he is one, is accused of nothing else than 
only this, that he is a Christian; but that he who arraigns him be burned alive. 
And I further desire, that he who is entrusted with the government of the 
province shall not compel the Christian, who confesses and certifies such a 
matter, to retract; neither shall he commit him. And I desire that these things 
be confirmed by a decree of the Senate. And I command this my edict to be 
published in the Forum of Trajan, in order that it may be read. The prefect 
Vitrasius Pollio will see that it be transmitted to all the provinces round 
about, and that no one who wishes to make use of or to possess it be hindered 
from obtaining a copy from the document I now publish.
