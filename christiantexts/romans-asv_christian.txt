The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 

1:1Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called 
to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, 1:2which he promised 
afore through his prophets in the holy scriptures, 1:3concerning his Son, 
who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, 1:4who was declared 
to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by 
the resurrection from the dead; even Jesus Christ our Lord, 1:5through whom we received grace and 
apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name's sake; 
1:6among whom are ye also called to 
be Jesus Christ's: 1:7To all that are in Rome, beloved of God, 
called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 1:8First, I thank my God through Jesus 
Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world. 1:9For 
God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how 
unceasingly I make mention of you, always in my prayers 1:10making request, if 
by any means now at length I may be prospered by the will of God to come unto 
you. 1:11For I long to see you, that I may 
impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; 1:12that is, that I with you may be 
comforted in you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine. 1:13And I would not have you ignorant, 
brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you (and was hindered 
hitherto), that I might have some fruit in you also, even as in the rest of the 
Gentiles. 1:14I am debtor both to Greeks and to 
Barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. 1:15So, as much as in 
me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are in Rome. 1:16For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for 
it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew 
first, and also to the Greek. 1:17For therein is revealed a righteousness 
of God from faith unto faith: as it is written, But the righteous shall live by 
faith. 1:18For the wrath of God is revealed from 
heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hinder the truth 
in unrighteousness; 1:19because that which is known of God is 
manifest in them; for God manifested it unto them. 1:20For the invisible 
things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived 
through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and 
divinity; that they may be without excuse: 1:21because that, 
knowing God, they glorified him not as God, neither gave thanks; but became vain 
in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened. 1:22Professing 
themselves to be wise, they became fools, 1:23and changed the 
glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, 
and of birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things. 1:24Wherefore God gave 
them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness, that their bodies should 
be dishonored among themselves: 1:25for that they exchanged the truth of 
God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, 
who is blessed for ever. Amen. 1:26For this cause God gave them up unto 
vile passions: for their women changed the natural use into that which is 
against nature: 1:27and likewise also the men, leaving the 
natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men 
working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error 
which was due. 1:28And even as they refused to have God in 
their knowledge, God gave them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those 
things which are not fitting; 1:29being filled with all unrighteousness, 
wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, 
malignity; whisperers, 1:30backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, 
haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 1:31without understanding, 
covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful: 1:32who, knowing the 
ordinance of God, that they that practise such things are worthy of death, not 
only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them. 

2:1Wherefore thou art without excuse, O 
man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judges another, thou 
condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost practise the same things. 2:2And 
we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that 
practise such things. 2:3And reckonest thou this, O man, who 
judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt 
escape the judgment of God? 2:4Or despisest thou the riches of his 
goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God 
leadeth thee to repentance? 2:5but after thy hardness and impenitent 
heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the 
righteous judgment of God; 2:6who will render to every man according 
to his works: 2:7to them that by patience in well-doing 
seek for glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life: 2:8but unto them that 
are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, shall be 
wrath and indignation, 2:9tribulation and anguish, upon every soul 
of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek; 2:10but glory and honor and peace to every 
man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek: 2:11for there is no respect of persons with 
God. 2:12For as many as have sinned without law 
shall also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law 
shall be judged by the law; 2:13for not the hearers of the law are just 
before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified: 2:14(for when Gentiles 
that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the 
law, are the law unto themselves; 2:15in that they show the work of the law 
written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their 
thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing them); 2:16in 
the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by 
Jesus Christ. 2:17But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, 
and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God, 2:18and knowest his 
will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the 
law, 2:19and art confident that thou thyself art 
a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness, 2:20a corrector of the 
foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the 
truth; 2:21thou therefore that teachest another, 
teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou 
steal? 2:22thou that sayest a man should not 
commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou 
rob temples? 2:23thou who gloriest in the law, through 
thy transgression of the law dishonorest thou God? 2:24For the name of God 
is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written. 2:25For circumcision indeed profiteth, if 
thou be a doer of the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy 
circumcision is become uncircumcision. 2:26If therefore the uncircumcision keep 
the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for 
circumcision? 2:27and shall not the uncircumcision which 
is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who with the letter and 
circumcision art a transgressor of the law? 2:28For he is not a Jew 
who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the 
flesh: 2:29but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; 
and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose 
praise is not of men, but of God. 

3:1What advantage then hath the Jew? or 
what is the profit of circumcision? 3:2Much every way: first of all, that they 
were intrusted with the oracles of God. 3:3For what if some were without faith? 
shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God? 3:4God 
forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, 
 That thou mightest be justified in thy words, 
 And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment. 
3:5But if our righteousness commendeth the 
righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with 
wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.) 3:6God forbid: for then how shall God judge 
the world? 3:7But if the truth of God through my lie 
abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner? 3:8and 
why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let 
us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just. 3:9What then? are we 
better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews 
and Greeks, that they are all under sin; 3:10as it is written, 
 There is none righteous, no, not one; 
 3:11There is none that understandeth, 
 There is none that seeketh after God; 
 3:12They have all turned aside, they are 
together become unprofitable; 
 There is none that doeth good, no, not, so much as one: 
 3:13Their throat is an open sepulchre; 
 With their tongues they have used deceit: 
 The poison of asps is under their lips: 
 3:14Whose mouth is full of cursing and 
bitterness: 
 3:15Their feet are swift to shed blood; 
 3:16Destruction and misery are in their 
ways; 
 3:17And the way of peace have they not 
known: 
 3:18There is no fear of God before their 
eyes. 
3:19Now we know that what things soever the 
law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be 
stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God: 3:20because by the works of the law shall 
no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law cometh the 
knowledge of sin. 3:21But now apart from the law a 
righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the 
prophets; 3:22even the righteousness of God through 
faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction; 
3:23for all have sinned, and fall short of 
the glory of God; 3:24being justified freely by his grace 
through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 3:25whom God set forth 
to be a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his 
righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the 
forbearance of God; 3:26for the showing, I say, of his 
righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the 
justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus. 3:27Where then is the 
glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of 
faith. 3:28We reckon therefore that a man is 
justified by faith apart from the works of the law. 3:29Or is God the 
God of Jews only? is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yea, of 
Gentiles also: 3:30if so be that God is one, and he shall 
justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith. 3:31Do 
we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish 
the law. 


4:1What then shall we say that Abraham, our 
forefather, hath found according to the flesh? 4:2For if Abraham was 
justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not toward God. 4:3For 
what saith the scripture? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him 
for righteousness. 4:4Now to him that worketh, the reward is 
not reckoned as of grace, but as of debt. 4:5But to him that worketh not, but 
believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for 
righteousness. 4:6Even as David also pronounceth blessing 
upon the man, unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works, 4:7saying, 
 Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, 
 And whose sins are covered. 
 4:8Blessed is the man to whom, the Lord 
will not reckon sin. 
4:9Is this blessing then pronounced upon 
the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say, To Abraham his 
faith was reckoned for righteousness. 4:10How then was it reckoned? when he was 
in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in 
uncircumcision: 4:11and he received the sign of 
circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was 
in uncircumcision; that he might be the father of all them that believe, though 
they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them; 4:12and the father of circumcision to them 
who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that 
faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision. 4:13For not through the 
law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the 
world, but through the righteousness of faith. 4:14For if they that 
are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none 
effect: 4:15for the law worketh wrath; but where 
there is no law, neither is there transgression. 4:16For this cause 
it is of faith, that it may be according to grace; to the end that 
the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, 
but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all 
4:17(as it is written, A father of many 
nations have I made thee) before him whom he believed, even God, who 
giveth life to the dead, and calleth the things that are not, as though they 
were. 4:18Who in hope believed against hope, to 
the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which 
had been spoken, So shall thy seed be. 4:19And without being weakened in faith he 
considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years 
old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb; 4:20yet, looking unto the promise of God, 
he wavered not through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to 
God, 4:21and being fully assured that what he 
had promised, he was able also to perform. 4:22Wherefore also it 
was reckoned unto him for righteousness. 4:23Now it was not written for his sake 
alone, that it was reckoned unto him; 4:24but for our sake also, unto whom it 
shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, 
4:25who was delivered up for our 
trespasses, and was raised for our justification. 


5:1Being therefore justified by faith, we 
have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; 5:2through whom also we 
have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand; and we rejoice in 
hope of the glory of God. 5:3And not only so, but we also rejoice in 
our tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh stedfastness; 5:4and 
stedfastness, approvedness; and approvedness, hope: 5:5and hope putteth not 
to shame; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts through 
the Holy Spirit which was given unto us. 5:6For while we were yet weak, in due 
season Christ died for the ungodly. 5:7For scarcely for a righteous man will 
one die: for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die. 5:8But 
God commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, 
Christ died for us. 5:9Much more then, being now justified by 
his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath of God through him. 5:10For if, while we were enemies, we were 
reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, 
shall we be saved by his life; 5:11and not only so, but we also rejoice in 
God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the 
reconciliation. 5:12Therefore, as through one man sin 
entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, 
for that all sinned:-- 5:13for until the law sin was in the world; 
but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 5:14Nevertheless death 
reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the 
likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a figure of him that was to come. 5:15But not as the trespass, so also 
is the free gift. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much 
more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus 
Christ, abound unto the many. 5:16And not as through one that sinned, 
so is the gift: for the judgment came of one unto condemnation, 
but the free gift came of many trespasses unto justification. 5:17For if, by the trespass of the one, 
death reigned through the one; much more shall they that receive the abundance 
of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, 
even Jesus Christ. 5:18So then as through one trespass the 
judgment came unto all men to condemnation; even so through one act of 
righteousness the free gift came unto all men to justification of life. 
5:19For as through the one man's 
disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the 
one shall the many be made righteous. 5:20And the law came in besides, that the 
trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more 
exceedingly: 5:21that, as sin reigned in death, even so 
might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ 
our Lord. 

6:1What shall we say then? Shall we 
continue in sin, that grace may abound? 6:2God forbid. We who died to sin, how 
shall we any longer live therein? 6:3Or are ye ignorant that all we who were 
baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 6:4We were buried 
therefore with him through baptism unto death: that like as Christ was raised 
from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness 
of life. 6:5For if we have become united with 
him in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness 
of his resurrection; 6:6knowing this, that our old man was 
crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we 
should no longer be in bondage to sin; 6:7for he that hath died is justified from 
sin. 6:8But if we died with Christ, we believe 
that we shall also live with him; 6:9knowing that Christ being raised from 
the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him. 6:10For the death that he died, he died 
unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God. 6:11Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be 
dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus. 6:12Let not sin 
therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof: 6:13neither present your members unto sin 
as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as 
alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness 
unto God. 6:14For sin shall not have dominion over 
you: for ye are not under law, but under grace. 6:15What then? shall we 
sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid. 6:16Know ye not, that to whom ye present 
yourselves as servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; 
whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 6:17But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye 
were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching 
whereunto ye were delivered; 6:18and being made free from sin, ye became 
servants of righteousness. 6:19I speak after the manner of men because 
of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members as 
servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your 
members as servants to righteousness unto sanctification. 6:20For when ye were servants of sin, ye 
were free in regard of righteousness. 6:21What fruit then had ye at that time in 
the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. 6:22But now being made free from sin and 
become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end 
eternal life. 6:23For the wages of sin is death; but the 
free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. 

7:1Or are ye ignorant, brethren (for I 
speak to men who know the law), that the law hath dominion over a man for so 
long time as he liveth? 7:2For the woman that hath a husband is 
bound by law to the husband while he liveth; but if the husband die, she is 
discharged from the law of the husband. 7:3So then if, while the husband liveth, 
she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the 
husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she 
be joined to another man. 7:4Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were 
made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to 
another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring 
forth fruit unto God. 7:5For when we were in the flesh, the 
sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring 
forth fruit unto death. 7:6But now we have been discharged from the 
law, having died to that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of 
the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter. 7:7What shall we say 
then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through 
the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not 
covet: 7:8but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me 
through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin 
is dead. 7:9And I was alive apart from the law once: 
but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died; 7:10and the 
commandment, which was unto life, this I found to be unto death: 
7:11for sin, finding occasion, through the 
commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me. 7:12So that the law is 
holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good. 7:13Did then that which 
is good become death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shown to be 
sin, by working death to me through that which is good; --that through the 
commandment sin might become exceeding sinful. 7:14For we know that 
the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. 7:15For that which I do 
I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I 
do. 7:16But if what I would not, that I do, I 
consent unto the law that it is good. 7:17So now it is no more I that do it, but 
sin which dwelleth in me. 7:18For I know that in me, that is, in my 
flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that 
which is good is not. 7:19For the good which I would I do not: 
but the evil which I would not, that I practise. 7:20But if what I would 
not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me. 7:21I 
find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present. 7:22For I delight in the law of God after 
the inward man: 7:23but I see a different law in my 
members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity 
under the law of sin which is in my members. 7:24Wretched man that I 
am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death? 7:25I thank God through 
Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I of myself with the mind, indeed, serve the law 
of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. 

8:1There is therefore now no condemnation 
to them that are in Christ Jesus. 8:2For the law of the Spirit of life in 
Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death. 8:3For what the law 
could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in 
the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: 8:4that 
the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, 
but after the Spirit. 8:5For they that are after the flesh mind 
the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the 
Spirit. 8:6For the mind of the flesh is death; but 
the mind of the Spirit is life and peace: 8:7because the mind of the flesh is enmity 
against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be: 
8:8and they that are in the flesh cannot 
please God. 8:9But ye are not in the flesh but in the 
Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any man hath not 
the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. 8:10And if Christ is in you, the body is 
dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness. 8:11But if the Spirit of him that raised up 
Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the 
dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth 
in you. 8:12So then, brethren, we are debtors, not 
to the flesh, to live after the flesh: 8:13for if ye live after the flesh, ye must 
die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live. 
8:14For as many as are led by the Spirit of 
God, these are sons of God. 8:15For ye received not the spirit of 
bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, 
Abba, Father. 8:16The Spirit himself beareth witness with 
our spirit, that we are children of God: 8:17and if children, then heirs; heirs of 
God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that 
we may be also glorified with him. 8:18For I reckon that 
the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory 
which shall be revealed to us-ward. 8:19For the earnest expectation of the 
creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God. 8:20For the creation 
was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected 
it, in hope 8:21that the creation itself also shall be 
delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the 
children of God. 8:22For we know that the whole creation 
groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. 8:23And not only so, 
but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves 
groan within ourselves, waiting for our adoption, to wit, the 
redemption of our body. 8:24For in hope were we saved: but hope 
that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth? 8:25But if we hope for that which we see 
not, then do we with patience wait for it. 8:26And in like manner 
the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; 
but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which 
cannot be uttered; 8:27and he that searcheth the hearts 
knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the 
saints according to the will of God. 8:28And we know that to 
them that love God all things work together for good, even to them that 
are called according to his purpose. 8:29For whom he 
foreknew, he also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his Son, 
that he might be the firstborn among many brethren: 8:30and whom he 
foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: 
and whom he justified, them he also glorified. 8:31What then shall we 
say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? 8:32He 
that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not 
also with him freely give us all things? 8:33Who shall lay anything to the charge of 
God's elect? It is God that justifieth; 8:34who is he that condemneth? It is Christ 
Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right 
hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. 8:35Who shall separate 
us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or 
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 8:36Even as it is 
written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep 
for the slaughter. 8:37Nay, in all these things we are more 
than conquerors through him that loved us. 8:38For I am persuaded, 
that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things 
present, nor things to come, nor powers, 8:39nor height, nor depth, nor any other 
creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ 
Jesus our Lord. 

9:1I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my 
conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit, 9:2that I have great 
sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart. 9:3For I could wish that I myself were 
anathema from Christ for my brethren's sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh: 
9:4who are Israelites; whose is the 
adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the 
service of God, and the promises; 9:5whose are the fathers, and of whom is 
Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. 9:6But 
it is not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not 
all Israel, that are of Israel: 9:7neither, because they are Abraham's 
seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. 9:8That 
is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the 
children of the promise are reckoned for a seed. 9:9For this is a word 
of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son. 9:10And not only so; but Rebecca also 
having conceived by one, even by our father Isaac-- 9:11for the 
children being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that 
the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him 
that calleth, 9:12it was said unto her, The elder shall 
serve the younger. 9:13Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, 
but Esau I hated. 9:14What shall we say then? Is there 
unrighteousness with God? God forbid. 9:15For he saith to Moses, I will have 
mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have 
compassion. 9:16So then it is not of him that willeth, 
nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy. 9:17For the scripture 
saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show 
in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth. 
9:18So then he hath mercy on whom he will, 
and whom he will be hardeneth. 9:19Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he 
still find fault? For who withstandeth his will? 9:20Nay but, O man, who 
art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that 
formed it, Why didst thou make me thus? 9:21Or hath not the potter a right over the 
clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto 
dishonor? 9:22What if God, willing to show his wrath, 
and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath 
fitted unto destruction: 9:23and that he might make known the riches 
of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory, 9:24even us, whom he also called, 
not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles? 9:25As he saith also in 
Hosea, 
 I will call that my people, which was not my people; 
 And her beloved, that was not beloved. 
 9:26And it shall be, that in the 
place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, 
 There shall they be called sons of the living God. 
9:27And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If 
the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the 
remnant that shall be saved: 9:28for the Lord will execute his 
word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short. 9:29And, as Isaiah hath 
said before, 
 Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, 
 We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah. 
9:30What shall we say then? That the 
Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even 
the righteousness which is of faith: 9:31but Israel, following after a law of 
righteousness, did not arrive at that law. 9:32Wherefore? Because 
they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at 
the stone of stumbling; 9:33even as it is written, 
 Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence: 
 And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame. 

10:1Brethren, my heart's desire and my 
supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved. 10:2For I bear them 
witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. 10:3For being ignorant of God's 
righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject 
themselves to the righteousness of God. 10:4For Christ is the end of the law unto 
righteousness to every one that believeth. 10:5For Moses writeth 
that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live 
thereby. 10:6But the righteousness which is of faith 
saith thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to 
bring Christ down:) 10:7or, Who shall descend into the abyss? 
(That is, to bring Christ up from the dead.) 10:8But what saith it? 
The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of 
faith, which we preach: 10:9because if thou shalt confess with thy 
mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him 
from the dead, thou shalt be saved: 10:10for with the heart man believeth unto 
righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 10:11For the scripture saith, Whosoever 
believeth on him shall not be put to shame. 10:12For there is no 
distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same Lord is Lord of all, and 
is rich unto all that call upon him: 10:13for, Whosoever shall call upon the 
name of the Lord shall be saved. 10:14How then shall they call on him in 
whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have 
not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 10:15and how shall they 
preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet 
of them that bring glad tidings of good things! 10:16But they did not 
all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our 
report? 10:17So belief cometh of hearing, 
and hearing by the word of Christ. 10:18But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, 
verily, 
 Their sound went out into all the earth, 
 And their words unto the ends of the world. 
10:19But I say, Did Israel not know? First 
Moses saith, 
 I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, 
 With a nation void of understanding will I anger you. 
10:20And Isaiah is very bold, and saith, 
 I was found of them that sought me not; 
 I became manifest unto them that asked not of me. 
10:21But as to Israel he saith, All the day 
long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. 

11:1I say then, Did God cast off his 
people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the 
tribe of Benjamin. 11:2God did not cast off his people which 
he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth 
with God against Israel: 11:3Lord, they have killed thy prophets, 
they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. 
11:4But what saith the answer of God unto 
him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to 
Baal. 11:5Even so then at this present time also 
there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 11:6But if it is by 
grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. 11:7What then? that which Israel seeketh 
for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were 
hardened: 11:8according as it is written, God gave 
them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they 
should not hear, unto this very day. 11:9And David saith, 
 Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, 
 And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them: 
 11:10Let their eyes be darkened, that they 
may not see, 
 And bow thou down their back always. 
11:11I say then, Did they stumble that they 
might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation is come unto the 
Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. 11:12Now if their fall, is the riches of 
the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their 
fulness? 11:13But I speak to you that are Gentiles. 
Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry; 11:14if by any means I may provoke to 
jealousy them that are my flesh, and may save some of them. 11:15For if the casting away of them 
is the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of 
them be, but life from the dead? 11:16And if the firstfruit is holy, so is 
the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches. 11:17But if some of the 
branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among 
them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the 
olive tree; 11:18glory not over the branches: but if 
thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee. 11:19Thou wilt say then, Branches were 
broken off, that I might be grafted in. 11:20Well; by their unbelief they were 
broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 11:21for if God spared not the natural 
branches, neither will he spare thee. 11:22Behold then the goodness and severity 
of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God's goodness, if 
thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. 11:23And they also, if they continue not in 
their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again. 11:24For if thou wast cut out of that which 
is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good 
olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be 
grafted into their own olive tree? 11:25For I would not, brethren, have you 
ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening 
in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; 11:26and so all Israel shall be saved: even 
as it is written, 
 There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; 
 He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: 
 11:27And this is my covenant unto them, 
 When I shall take away their sins. 
11:28As touching the gospel, they are 
enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the 
fathers' sake. 11:29For the gifts and the calling of God 
are not repented of. 11:30For as ye in time past were 
disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience, 11:31even so have these also now been 
disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy. 11:32For God hath shut up all unto 
disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all. 11:33O the depth of the 
riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his 
judgments, and his ways past tracing out! 11:34For who hath known 
the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? 11:35or who hath first 
given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? 11:36For of him, and 
through him, and unto him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever. 
Amen. 

12:1I beseech you therefore, brethren, by 
the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable 
to God, which is your spiritual service. 12:2And be not 
fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your 
mind, and ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. 
12:3For I say, through the grace that was 
given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly 
than he ought to think; but to think as to think soberly, according as God hath 
dealt to each man a measure of faith. 12:4For even as we have many members in one 
body, and all the members have not the same office: 12:5so we, who are 
many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another. 12:6And having gifts differing according to 
the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy 
according to the proportion of our faith; 12:7or ministry, let 
us give ourselves to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching; 12:8or 
he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, let him do it with 
liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with 
cheerfulness. 12:9Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor 
that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. 12:10In love of the 
brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one 
another; 12:11in diligence not slothful; fervent in 
spirit; serving the Lord; 12:12rejoicing in hope; patient in 
tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer; 12:13communicating to 
the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality. 12:14Bless them that 
persecute you; bless, and curse not. 12:15Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep 
with them that weep. 12:16Be of the same mind one toward 
another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are 
lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits. 12:17Render to no man 
evil for evil. Take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men. 12:18If it be possible, as much as in you 
lieth, be at peace with all men. 12:19Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but 
give place unto the wrath of God: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth 
unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord. 12:20But if thine enemy 
hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt 
heap coals of fire upon his head. 12:21Be not overcome of evil, but overcome 
evil with good. 

13:1Let every soul be in subjection to the 
higher powers: for there is no power but of God; and the powers that be 
are ordained of God. 13:2Therefore he that resisteth the power, 
withstandeth the ordinance of God: and they that withstand shall receive to 
themselves judgment. 13:3For rulers are not a terror to the good 
work, but to the evil. And wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that 
which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same: 13:4for he is a 
minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; 
for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is a minister of God, an avenger 
for wrath to him that doeth evil. 13:5Wherefore ye must needs be in 
subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience' sake. 13:6For this cause ye pay tribute also; for 
they are ministers of God's service, attending continually upon this very thing. 
13:7Render to all their dues: tribute to 
whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to 
whom honor. 13:8Owe no man anything, save to love one 
another: for he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law. 13:9For this, Thou shalt not commit 
adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet, and 
if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou 
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 13:10Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: 
love therefore is the fulfilment of the law. 13:11And this, knowing 
the season, that already it is time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is 
salvation nearer to us than when we first believed. 13:12The night is far 
spent, and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, 
and let us put on the armor of light. 13:13Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; 
not in revelling and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in 
strife and jealousy. 13:14But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof. 


14:1But him that is weak in faith receive 
ye, yet not for decision of scruples. 14:2One man hath faith 
to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs. 14:3Let not him that 
eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge 
him that eateth: for God hath received him. 14:4Who art thou that 
judgest the servant of another? to his own lord he standeth or falleth. Yea, he 
shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand. 14:5One man esteemeth one day above 
another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let each man be fully assured 
in his own mind. 14:6He that regardeth the day, regardeth it 
unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God 
thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God 
thanks. 14:7For none of us liveth to himself, and 
none dieth to himself. 14:8For whether we live, we live unto the 
Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or 
die, we are the Lord's. 14:9For to this end Christ died and lived 
again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living. 14:10But thou, why dost thou judge thy 
brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall 
all stand before the judgment-seat of God. 14:11For it is written, 

 As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, 
 And every tongue shall confess to God. 
14:12So then each one of us shall give 
account of himself to God. 14:13Let us not therefore judge one another 
any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his 
brother's way, or an occasion of falling. 14:14I know, and am 
persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him 
who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 14:15For if because of meat thy brother is 
grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom 
Christ died. 14:16Let not then your good be evil spoken 
of: 14:17for the kingdom of God is not eating 
and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 14:18For he that herein serveth Christ is 
well-pleasing to God, and approved of men. 14:19So then let us 
follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one 
another. 14:20Overthrow not for meat's sake the work 
of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth 
with offence. 14:21It is good not to eat flesh, nor to 
drink wine, nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth. 14:22The faith which thou hast, have thou 
to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he 
approveth. 14:23But he that doubteth is condemned if 
he eat, because he eateth not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is 
sin. 

15:1Now we that are strong ought to bear 
the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 15:2Let each one of us 
please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying. 15:3For Christ also 
pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that 
reproached thee fell upon me. 15:4For whatsoever things were written 
aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through 
comfort of the scriptures we might have hope. 15:5Now the God of 
patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another 
according to Christ Jesus: 15:6that with one accord ye may with one 
mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 15:7Wherefore receive 
ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God. 15:8For I say that Christ hath been made a 
minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the 
promises given unto the fathers, 15:9and that the Gentiles might glorify God 
for his mercy; as it is written, 
 Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, 
 And sing unto thy name. 
15:10And again he saith, 
 Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. 
15:11And again, 
 Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; 
 And let all the peoples praise him. 
15:12And again, Isaiah saith, 
 There shall be the root of Jesse, 
 And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; 
 On him shall the Gentiles hope. 
15:13Now the God of hope fill you with all 
joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy 
Spirit. 15:14And I myself also am persuaded of you, 
my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, 
able also to admonish one another. 15:15But I write the more boldly unto you 
in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that 
was given me of God, 15:16that I should be a minister of Christ 
Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of 
the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. 15:17I have therefore my glorifying in 
Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God. 15:18For I will not 
dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the 
obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed, 15:19in the power of 
signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and 
round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ; 15:20yea, making it my aim so to preach the 
gospel, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build upon 
another man's foundation; 15:21but, as it is written, 
 They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, 
 And they who have not heard shall understand. 
15:22Wherefore also I was hindered these 
many times from coming to you: 15:23but now, having no more any place in 
these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you, 15:24whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope 
to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if 
first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)-- 15:25but now, I say, I go unto 
Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints. 15:26For it hath been the good pleasure of 
Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the 
saints that are at Jerusalem. 15:27Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; 
and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of 
their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to minister unto them in 
carnal things. 15:28When therefore I have accomplished 
this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain. 15:29And I know that, when I come unto you, 
I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ. 15:30Now I beseech you, 
brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye 
strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; 15:31that I may be 
delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and that my 
ministration which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints; 
15:32that I may come unto you in joy 
through the will of God, and together with you find rest. 15:33Now the God of 
peace be with you all. Amen. 

16:1I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, 
who is a servant of the church that is at Cenchreae: 16:2that ye receive her 
in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever matter 
she may have need of you: for she herself also hath been a helper of many, and 
of mine own self. 16:3Salute Prisca and Aquila my 
fellow-workers in Christ Jesus, 16:4who for my life laid down their own 
necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the 
Gentiles: 16:5and salute the church that is in 
their house. Salute Epaenetus my beloved, who is the first-fruits of Asia unto 
Christ. 16:6Salute Mary, who bestowed much labor on 
you. 16:7Salute Andronicus and Junias, my 
kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also 
have been in Christ before me. 16:8Salute Ampliatus my beloved in the 
Lord. 16:9Salute Urbanus our fellow-worker in 
Christ, and Stachys my beloved. 16:10Salute Apelles the approved in Christ. 
Salute them that are of the household of Aristobulus. 16:11Salute Herodion my kinsman. Salute 
them of the household of Narcissus, that are in the Lord. 16:12Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who 
labor in the Lord. Salute Persis the beloved, who labored much in the Lord. 16:13Salute Rufus the chosen in the Lord, 
and his mother and mine. 16:14Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, 
Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren that are with them. 16:15Salute Philologus 
and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints that are with 
them. 16:16Salute one another with a holy kiss. 
All the churches of Christ salute you. 16:17Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them 
that are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the 
doctrine which ye learned: and turn away from them. 16:18For they that are 
such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and 
fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent. 16:19For your obedience 
is come abroad unto all men. I rejoice therefore over you: but I would have you 
wise unto that which is good, and simple unto that which is evil. 16:20And the God of peace shall bruise 
Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
16:21Timothy my fellow-worker saluteth you; 
and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen. 16:22I Tertius, who 
write the epistle, salute you in the Lord. 16:23Gaius my host, and 
of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth 
you, and Quartus the brother. 16:24The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ 
be with you all. Amen. 16:25Now to him that is able to establish 
you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the 
revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal, 
16:26but now is manifested, and by the 
scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is 
made known unto all the nations unto obedience of faith: 16:27to the only wise 
God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory for ever. Amen.
