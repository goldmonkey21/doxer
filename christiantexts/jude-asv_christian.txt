The Epistle of Jude












The Book of St Jude


1:1Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and 
brother of James, to them that are called, beloved in God the Father, and kept 
for Jesus Christ: 1:2Mercy unto you and peace and love be 
multiplied. 1:3Beloved, while I was giving all 
diligence to write unto you of our common salvation, I was constrained to write 
unto you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all 
delivered unto the saints. 1:4For there are certain men crept in 
privily, even they who were of old written of beforehand unto this 
condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and 
denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. 1:5Now I desire to put 
you in remembrance, though ye know all things once for all, that the Lord, 
having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that 
believed not. 1:6And angels that kept not their own 
principality, but left their proper habitation, he hath kept in everlasting 
bonds under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. 1:7Even as Sodom and 
Gomorrah, and the cities about them, having in like manner with these given 
themselves over to fornication and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an 
example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire. 1:8Yet in like manner 
these also in their dreamings defile the flesh, and set at nought dominion, and 
rail at dignities. 1:9But Michael the archangel, when 
contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring 
against him a railing judgment, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. 1:10But these rail at whatsoever things 
they know not: and what they understand naturally, like the creatures without 
reason, in these things are they destroyed. 1:11Woe unto them! For 
they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, 
and perished in the gainsaying of Korah. 1:12These are they who are hidden rocks in 
your love-feasts when they feast with you, shepherds that without fear feed 
themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn leaves without 
fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; 1:13Wild waves of the 
sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of 
darkness hath been reserved forever. 1:14And to these also Enoch, the seventh 
from Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his 
holy ones, 1:15to execute judgment upon all, and to 
convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have 
ungodly wrought, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken 
against him. 1:16These are murmurers, complainers, 
walking after their lusts (and their mouth speaketh great swelling 
words), showing respect of persons for the sake of advantage. 1:17But ye, beloved, remember ye the words 
which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 1:18That they said to you, In the last time 
there shall be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts. 1:19These are they who make separations, 
sensual, having not the Spirit. 1:20But ye, beloved, building up yourselves 
on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, 1:21keep yourselves in 
the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal 
life. 1:22And on some have mercy, who are in 
doubt; 1:23and some save, snatching them out of 
the fire; and on some have mercy with fear; hating even the garment spotted by 
the flesh. 1:24Now unto him that is able to guard you 
from stumbling, and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish 
in exceeding joy, 1:25to the only God our Saviour, through 
Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and power, before all 
time, and now, and for evermore. Amen.
