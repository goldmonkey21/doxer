The Epistle of Jude












The Letter from Jude 

1:1Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and 
brother of James, to those who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and 
kept for Jesus Christ: 1:2Mercy to you and peace and love be 
multiplied. 
1:3Beloved, while I was very eager to write 
to you about our common salvation, I was constrained to write to you exhorting 
you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the 
saints. 1:4For there are certain men who crept in 
secretly, even those who were long ago written about for this condemnation: 
ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying our 
only Master, God, and Lord, Jesus Christ. 
1:5Now I desire to remind you, though you 
already know this, that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of 
Egypt, afterward destroyed those who didn't believe. 1:6Angels who didn't 
keep their first domain, but deserted their own dwelling place, he has kept in 
everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day. 1:7Even 
as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, having, in the same way as 
these, given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, 
are set forth as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire. 1:8Yet 
in like manner these also in their dreaming defile the flesh, despise authority, 
and slander celestial beings. 1:9But Michael, the archangel, when 
contending with the devil and arguing about the body of Moses, dared not bring 
against him an abusive condemnation, but said, "May the Lord rebuke you!" 1:10But these speak evil of whatever things 
they don't know. What they understand naturally, like the creatures without 
reason, in these things are they destroyed. 1:11Woe to them! For 
they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, 
and perished in Korah's rebellion. 1:12These are hidden rocky reefs in your 
love feasts when they feast with you, shepherds who without fear feed 
themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn leaves without 
fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; 1:13wild waves of the 
sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of 
darkness has been reserved forever. 1:14About these also Enoch, the seventh 
from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his 
holy ones, 1:15to execute judgment on all, and to 
convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have done 
in an ungodly way, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken 
against him." 1:16These are murmurers and complainers, 
walking after their lusts (and their mouth speaks proud things), showing respect 
of persons to gain advantage. 
1:17But you, beloved, remember the words 
which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1:18They said to you that "In the last time 
there will be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts." 1:19These are they who cause divisions, and 
are sensual, not having the Spirit. 1:20But you, beloved, keep building up 
yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit. 1:21Keep yourselves in the love of God, 
looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life. 1:22On 
some have compassion, making a distinction, 1:23and some save, 
snatching them out of the fire with fear, hating even the clothing stained by 
the flesh. 
1:24Now to him who is able to keep them 
from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory in 
great joy, 1:25to God our Savior, who alone is wise, 
be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen.
