The Prayer of the Apostle Paul











Translated by Dieter Mueller
(Approximately two lines are missing.) 
... your light, give me your mercy! My Redeemer, redeem me, for I am yours; the one who
      has come forth from you. You are my mind; bring me forth! You are my treasure house; open
      for me! You are my fullness; take me to you! You are (my) repose; give me the perfect
      thing that cannot be grasped! 
I invoke you, the one who is and who pre-existed in the name which is exalted above
      every name, through Jesus Christ, the Lord of Lords, the King of the ages; give me your
      gifts, of which you do not repent, through the Son of Man, the Spirit, the Paraclete of
      truth. Give me authority when I ask you; give healing for my body when I ask you through
      the Evangelist, and redeem my eternal light soul and my spirit. And the First-born of the
      Pleroma of grace -- reveal him to my mind! 
Grant what no angel eye has seen and no archon ear (has) heard, and what has not
      entered into the human heart which came to be angelic and (modelled) after the image of
      the psychic God when it was formed in the beginning, since I have faith and hope. And
      place upon me your beloved, elect, and blessed greatness, the First-born, the
      First-begotten, and the wonderful mystery of your house; for yours is the power and the
      glory and the praise and the greatness for ever and ever. Amen.
