TERTULLIAN 
THE FIVE BOOKS AGAINST MARCION.
BOOK IV. 
WHICH TERTULLIAN PURSUES HIS ARGUMENT. JESUS IS THE CHRIST OF THE CREATOR. 
HE
DERIVES HIS PROOFS FROM ST. LUKE'S GOSPEL; THAT BEING THE ONLY 
HISTORICAL
PORTION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PARTIALLY ACCEPTED BY MARCION. THIS BOOK MAY 
ALSO
BE REGARDED AS A COMMENTARY ON ST. LUKE. IT GIVES REMARKABLE PROOF OF
TERTULLIAN'S GRASP OF SCRIPTURE, AND PROVES THAT "THE OLD TESTAMENT IS 
NOT
CONTRARY TO THE NEW." IT ALSO ABOUNDS IN STRIKING EXPOSITIONS OF 
SCRIPTURAL
PASSAGES, EMBRACING PROFOUND VIEWS OF REVELATION, IN CONNECTION WITH 
THE
NATURE OF MAN.
CHAP. I.--EXAMINATION OF THE ANTITHESES OF MARCION, BRINGING THEM TO THE 
TEST OF MARCION'S OWN GOSPEL. CERTAIN TRUE ANTITHESES IN THE DISPENSATIONS OF 
THE OLD AND THE NEW TESTAMENTS.THESE VARIATIONS QUITE COMPATIBLE 
WITH ONE AND THE SAME GOD, WHO ORDERED THEM.
EVERY opinion and the whole scheme of the impious and sacrilegious Marcion we 
now bring to the test of that very Gospel which, by his process of 
interpolation, he has made his own. To encourage a belief of this Gospel he has 
actually devised for it a sort of dower, in a work composed of contrary 
statements set in opposition, thence entitled Antitheses, and compiled with a 
view to such a severance of the law from the gospel as should divide the Deity 
into two, nay, diverse, gods--one for each Instrument, or Testament as it is 
more usual to call it; that by such means he might also patronize belief in "the 
Gospel according to the Antitheses." These, however, I would have attacked in 
special combat, hand to hand; that is to say, I would have encountered singly 
the several devices Of the Pontic heretic, if it were not much more convenient 
to refute them in and with that very gospel to which they contribute their 
support. Although it is so easy to meet them at once with a peremptory demurrer, 
yet, in order that I may both make them admissible in argument, and account them 
valid expressions of opinion, and even contend that they make for our side, that 
so there may be all the redder shame for the blindness of their author, we have 
now drawn out some antitheses of our own in opposition to Marcion. And indeed I 
do allow that one order did run its course in the old dispensation under the 
Creator, and that another is on its way in the new under Christ. I do not deny 
that there is a difference in the language of their documents, in their precepts 
of virtue, and in their 
teachings of the law; but yet all this diversity is consistent with one and 
the same God, even Him by whom it was arranged and also foretold. Long ago did 
Isaiah declare that "out of Sion should go forth the law, and the word of the 
Lord from Jerusalem"--some other law, that is, and another word. In short, says 
he, "He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people;" meaning 
not those of the Jewish people only, but of the nations which are judged by the 
new law of the gospel and the new word of the apostles, and are amongst 
themselves rebuked of their old error as soon as they have believed. And as the 
result of this, "they beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears 
(which are a kind of hunting instruments) into pruning-hooks;" that is to say, 
minds, which once were fierce and cruel, are changed by them into good 
dispositions productive of good fruit. And again: "Hearken unto me, hearken unto 
me, my people, and ye kings, give ear unto me; for a law shall proceed from 
me,and my judgment for a light to the nations;" wherefore He had determined and 
decreed that the nations also were to be enlightened by the law and the word of 
the gospel. This will be that law which (according to David also) is 
unblameable, because "perfect, converting the soul" from idols unto God. This 
likewise will be the word concerning which the same Isaiah says, "For the Lord 
will make a decisive word in the land." Because the New Testament is 
compendiously short, and freed from the minute and perplexing burdens of the 
law. But why enlarge, when the Creator by the same prophet foretells the 
renovation more manifestly and clearly than the light itself? "Remember not the 
former things, neither consider the things of old" (the old things have passed 
away, and new things are arising). "Behold, I will do new things, which shall 
now spring forth." So by Jeremiah: "Break up for yourselves new pastures, and 
sow not among thorns, and circumcise yourselves in the foreskin of your heart." 
And in another passage: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make 
a new covenant with the house of Jacob, and with the house of Judah; not 
according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I 
arrested their dispensation, in order to bring them out of the land of Egypt." 
He thus shows that the ancient covenant is temporary only, when He indicates its 
change; also when He promises that it shall be followed by an eternal one. For 
by Isaiah He says: "Hear me, and ye shall live; and I will make an everlasting 
covenant with you," adding "the sure mercies of David," in order that He might 
show that that covenant was to run its course in Christ. That He was of the 
family of David, according to the genealogy of Mary, He declared in a figurative 
way even by the rod which was to proceed out of the stem of Jesse. Forasmuch 
then as he said, that from the Creator there would come other laws, and other 
words, and new dispensations of covenants, indicating also that the very 
sacrifices were to receive higher offices, and that amongst all nations, by 
Malachi when he says: "I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, neither will I 
accept your sacrifices at your hands. For from the rising of the sun, even unto 
the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in 
every place a sacrifice is offered unto my name, even a pure offering"--meaning 
simple prayer from a pure conscience,--it is of necessity that every change 
which comes as the result of innovation, introduces a diversity in those things 
of which the change is made, from which diversity arises also a contrariety. For 
as there is nothing, after it has undergone a change, which does not become 
different, so there is nothing different which is not contrary. Of that very 
thing, therefore, there will be predicated a contrariety in consequence of its 
diversity, to which there accrued a change of condition after an innovation. He 
who brought about the change, the same instituted the diversity also; He who 
foretold the innovation, the same announced beforehand the contrariety likewise. 
Why, in your interpretation, do you impute a difference in the state of things 
to a difference of powers? Why do you wrest to the Creator's prejudice those 
examples from which you draw your antitheses, when you may recognise them all in 
His sensations and affections? "I will wound," He says, "and I will heal;" "I 
will kill," He says again, "and I will make alive"--even 
the same "who createth evil and maketh peace;" from which you are used even 
to censure Him with the imputation of fickleness and inconstancy, as if He 
forbade what He commanded, and commanded what He forbade. Why, then, have you 
not reckoned up the Antitheses also which occur in the natural works of the 
Creator, who is for ever contrary to Himself? You have not been able, unless I 
am misinformed, to recognise the fact, that the world, at all events, even 
amongst your people of Pontus, is made up of a diversity of elements which are 
hostile to one another. It was therefore your bounden duty first to have 
determined that the god of the light was one being, and the god of darkness was 
another, in such wise that you might have been able to have distinctly asserted 
one of them to be the god of the law and the other the god of the gospel. It is, 
however, the settled conviction already of my mind from manifest proofs, that, 
as His works and plans exist in the way of Antitheses, so also by the same rule 
exist the mysteries of His religion. 
CHAP. II.--ST. LUKE'S GOSPEL, SELECTED BY MARCION AS HIS AUTHORITY, AND 
MUTILATED BY HIM. THE OTHER GOSPELS EQUALLY AUTHORITATIVE. MARCION'S TERMS OF 
DISCUSSION, HOWEVER, ACCEPTED, AND GRAPPLED WITH ON THE FOOTING OF ST. LUKE'S 
GOSPEL ALONE.
You have now our answer to the Antitheses compendiously indicated by us. I 
pass on to give a proof of the Gospel--not, to be sure, of Jewry, but of 
Pontus--having become meanwhile adulterated; and this shall indicate the order 
by which we proceed. We lay it down as our first position, that the evangelical 
Testament has apostles for its authors, to whom was assigned by the Lord Himself 
this office of publishing the gospel. Since, however, there are apostolic men 
also, they are yet not alone, but appear with apostles and after apostles; 
because the preaching of disciples might be open to the suspicion of an 
affectation of glory, if there did not accompany it the authority of the 
masters, which means that of Christ, for it was that which made the apostles 
their masters. Of the apostles, therefore, John and Matthew first instil faith 
into us; whilst of apostolic men, Luke and Mark renew it afterwards. These all 
start with the same principles of the faith, so far as relates to the one only 
God the Creator and His Christ, how that He was born of the Virgin, and came to 
fulfil the law and the prophets. Never mind if there does occur some variation 
in the order of their narratives, provided that there be agreement in the 
essential matter of the faith, in which there is disagreement with Marcion. 
Marcion, on the other hand, you must know, 
ascribes no author to his Gospel, as if it could not be allowed him to affix 
a title to that from which it was no crime (in his eyes) to subvert the very 
body. And here I might now make a stand, and contend that a work ought not to be 
recognised, which holds not its head erect, which exhibits no consistency, which 
gives no promise of credibility from the fulness of its title and the just 
profession of its author. But we prefer to join issue on every point; nor shall 
we leave unnoticed what may fairly be understood to be on our side. Now, of the 
authors whom we possess, Marcion seems to have singled out Luke for his 
mutilating process. Luke, however, was not an apostle, but only an apostolic 
man; not a master, but a disciple, and so inferior to a master--at least as far 
subsequent to him as the apostle whom he followed (and that, no doubt, was Paul) 
was subsequent to the others; so that, had Marcion even published his Gospel in 
the name of St. Paul himself, the single authority of the document, destitute of 
all support from preceding authorities, would not be a sufficient basis for our 
faith. There would be still wanted that Gospel which St. Paul found in 
existence, to which he yielded 
his belief, and with which he so earnestly wished his own to agree, that he 
actually on that account went up to Jerusalem to know and consult the apostles, 
"lest he should run, or had been running in vain;" in other words, that the 
faith which he had learned, and the gospel which he was preaching, might be in 
accordance with theirs. Then, at last, having conferred with the (primitive) 
authors, and having agreed with them touching the rule of faith, they joined 
their hands in fellowship, and divided their labours thenceforth in the office 
of preaching the gospel, so that they were to go to the Jews, and St. Paul to 
the Jews and the Gentiles. Inasmuch, therefore, as the enlightener of St. Luke 
himself desired the authority of his predecessors for both his own faith and 
preaching, how much more may not I require for Luke's Gospel that which was 
necessary for the Gospel of his master. 
CHAP. III.--MARCION INSINUATED THE UNTRUSTWORTHINESS OF CERTAIN APOSTLES 
WHOM ST. PAUL REBUKED. THE REBUKE SHOWS THAT IT CANNOT BE REGARDED AS 
DEROGATING FROM THEIR AUTHORITY. THE APOSTOLIC GOSPELS PERFECTLY AUTHENTIC.
In the scheme of Marcion, on the contrary, the mystery of the Christian 
religion begins from the discipleship of Luke. Since, however, it was on its 
course previous to that point, it must have had its own authentic materials, by 
means of which it found its own way down to St. Luke; and by the assistance of 
the testimony which it bore, Luke himself becomes admissible. Well, but Marcion, 
finding the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians (wherein he rebukes even apostles) 
for "not walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel," as well as 
accuses certain false apostles of perverting the gospel of Christ), labours very 
hard to destroy the character of those Gospels which are published as genuine 
and under the name of apostles, in order, forsooth, to secure for his own Gospel 
the credit which he takes away from them. But then, even if he censures Peter 
and John and James, who were thought to be pillars, it is for a manifest reason. 
They seemed to be changing their company from respect of persons. And yet as 
Paul himself "became all things to all men," that he might gain all, it was 
possible that Peter also might have betaken himself to the same plan of 
practising somewhat different from what he taught. And, in like manner, if false 
apostles also crept in, their character too showed itself in their insisting 
upon circumcision and the Jewish ceremonies. So that it was not on account of 
their preaching, but of their conversation, that they were marked by St. Paul, 
who would with equal impartiality have marked them with censure, if they had 
erred at all with respect to God the Creator or His Christ. Each several case 
will therefore have to be distinguished. When Marcion complains that apostles 
are suspected (for their prevarication and dissimulation) of having even 
depraved the gospel, he thereby accuses Christ, by accusing those whom Christ 
chose. If, then, the apostles, who are censured simply for inconsistency of 
walk, composed the Gospel in a pure form, but false apostles interpolated their 
true record; and if our own copies have been made from these, where will that 
genuine text of the apostle's writings be found which has not suffered 
adulteration? Which was it that enlightened Paul, and through him Luke? It is 
either completely blotted out, as if by some deluge--being obliterated by the 
inundation of falsifiers--in which case even Marcion does not possess the true 
Gospel; or else, is that very edition which Marcion alone possesses the true 
one, that is, of the apostles? How, then, does that agree with ours, which is 
said not to be (the work) of apostles, but of Luke? Or else, again, if that 
which Marcion uses is not to be attributed to Luke simply because it does agree 
with ours (which, of course, is, also adulterated in its title), then it is the 
work of apostles. Our Gospel, therefore, which is in agreement with it, is 
equally the work of apostles, but also adulterated in its title. 
CHAP. IV.--EACH SIDE CLAIMS TO POSSESS THE TRUE GOSPEL. ANTIQUITY THE 
CRITERION OF TRUTH IN SUCH A MATTER. MARCION'S PRETENSIONS AS AN AMENDER 
OF THE GOSPEL.
We must follow, then, the clue of our discussion, meeting every effort of our 
opponents 
with reciprocal vigor. I say that my Gospel is the true one; Marcion, that 
his is. I affirm that Marcion's Gospel is adulterated; Marcion, that mine is. 
Now what is to settle the point for us, except it be that principle of time, 
which rules that the authority lies with that which shall be found to be more 
ancient; and assumes as an elemental truth, that corruption (of doctrine) 
belongs to the side which shall be convicted of comparative lateness in its 
origin. For, inasmuch as error is falsification of truth, it must needs be that 
truth therefore precede error. A thing must exist prior to its suffering any 
casualty; and an object must precede all rivalry to itself. Else how absurd it 
would be, that, when we have proved our position to be the older one, and 
Marcion's the later, ours should yet appear to be the false one, before it had 
even received from truth its objective existence; 
and Marcion's should also be supposed to have experienced rivalry at our 
hands, even before its publication; and, in fine, that that should be thought to 
be the truer position which is the later one--a century later than the 
publication of all the many and great facts and records of the Christian 
religion, which certainly could not have been published without, that is to say, 
before, the truth of the gospel. With regard, then, to the pending 
question, of Luke's Gospel (so far as its being the common property of 
ourselves and Marcion enables it to be decisive of the truth,) that portion of 
it which we alone receive is so much older than Marcion, that Marcion, himself 
once believed it, when in the first warmth of faith he contributed money to the 
Catholic church, which along with himself was afterwards rejected, when he fell 
away from our truth into his own heresy. What if the Marcionites have denied 
that he held the primitive faith amongst ourselves, in the face even of his own 
letter? What, if they do not acknowledge the letter? They, at any rate, receive 
his Antitheses; and more than that, they make ostentatious use of them. Proof 
out of these is enough for me. For if the Gospel, said to be Luke's which is 
current amongst us (we shall see whether it be also current with Marcion), is 
the very one which, as Marcion argues in his Antitheses, was interpolated by the 
defenders of Judaism, for the purpose of such a conglomeration with it of the 
law and the prophets as should enable them out of it to fashion their Christ, 
surely he could not have so argued about it, unless he had found it (in such a 
form). No one censures things before they exist, when he knows not whether they 
will come to pass. Emendation never precedes the fault. To be sure, an amender 
of that Gospel, which had been all topsy-turvy from the days of Tiberius to 
those of Antoninus, first presented himself in Marcion alone--so long looked for 
by Christ, who was all along regretting that he had been in so great a hurry to 
send out his apostles without the support of Marcion! But for all that, heresy, 
which is for ever mending the Gospels, and corrupting them in the act, is an 
affair of man's audacity, not of God's authority; and if Marcion be even a 
disciple, he is yet not "above his master;" if Marcion be an apostle, still as 
Paul says, "Whether it be I or they, so we preach;" if Marcion be a prophet, 
even "the spirits of the prophets will be subject to the prophets," for they are 
not the authors of confusion, but of peace; or if Marcion be actually an angel, 
he must rather be designated "as anathema than as a preacher of the gospel," 
because it is a strange gospel which he has preached. So that, whilst he amends, 
he only confirms both positions: both that our Gospel is the prior one, for he 
amends that which he has previously fallen in with; and that that is the later 
one, which, by putting it together out of the emendations of ours, he has made 
his own Gospel, and a novel one too. 
CHAP. V.--BY THE RULE OF ANTIQUITY, THE CATHOLIC GOSPELS ARE FOUND TO BE 
TRUE, INCLUDING THE REAL ST. LUKE'S. MARCION'S ONLY A MUTILATED EDITION. THE 
HERETIC'S WEAKNESS AND INCONSISTENCY IN IGNORING THE OTHER GOSPELS.
On the whole, then, if that is evidently more true which is earlier, if that 
is earlier which is from the very beginning, if that is from the beginning which 
has the apostles for its authors, then it will certainly be quite as evident, 
that that comes down from the apos 
ties, which has been kept as a sacred deposit in the churches of the 
apostles. Let us see what milk the Corinthians drank from Paul; to what rule of 
faith the Galatians were brought for correction; what the Philippians, the 
Thessalonians, the Ephesians read by it; what utterance also the Romans give, so 
very near (to the apostles), to whom Peter and Paul conjointly bequeathed the 
gospel even sealed with their own blood. We have also St. John's foster 
churches. For although Marcion rejects his Apocalypse, the orders of the bishops 
(thereof), when traced up to their origin, will yet rest on John as their 
author. In the same manner is recognised the excellent source of the other 
churches. I say, therefore, that in them (and not simply such of them as were 
rounded by apostles, but in all those which are united with them in the 
fellowship of the mystery of the gospel of Christ) that Gospel of Luke which we 
are defending with all our might has stood its ground from its very first 
publication; whereas Marcion's Gospel is not known to most people, and to none 
whatever is it known without being at the same time condemned. It too, of 
course, has its churches, but specially its own--as late as they are spurious; 
and should you want to know their original, you will more easily discover 
apostasy in it than apostolicity, with Marcion forsooth as their founder, or 
some one of Marcion's swarm. Even wasps make combs; so also these Marcionites 
make churches. The same authority of the apostolic churches will afford evidence 
to the other Gospels also, which we possess equally through their means, and 
according to their usage--I mean the Gospels of John and Matthew--whilst that 
which Mark published may be affirmed to be Peter's whose interpreter Mark was. 
For even Luke's form of the Gospel men unsually ascribe to Paul. And it may well 
seem that the works which disciples publish belong to their masters. Well, then, 
Marcion ought to be called to a strict account concerning these (other Gospels) 
also, for having omitted them, and insisted in preference on Luke; as if they, 
too, had not had free course in the churches, as well as Luke's Gospel, from the 
beginning. Nay, it is even more credible that they existed from the very 
beginning; for, being the work of apostles, they were prior, and coeval in 
origin with the churches themselves. But how comes it to pass, if the apostles 
published nothing, that their disciples were more forward in such a work; for 
they could not have been disciples, without any instruction from their masters? 
If, then, it be evident that these (Gospels) also were current in the churches, 
why did not Marcion touch them--either to amend them if they were adulterated, 
or to acknowledge them if they were uncorrupt? For it is but natural that they 
who were perverting the gospel, should be more solicitous about the perversion 
of those things whose authority they knew to be more generally received. Even 
the false apostles (were so called) on this very account, because they imitated 
the apostles by means of their falsification. In as far, then, as he might have 
amended what there was to amend, if found corrupt, in so far did he firmly imply 
that all was free from corruption which he did not think required amendment. In 
short, he simply amended what he thought was corrupt; though, indeed, not even 
this justly, because it was not really corrupt. For if the (Gospels) of the 
apostles have come down to us in their integrity, whilst Luke's, which is 
received amongst us, so far accords with their rule as to be on a par with them 
in permanency of reception in the churches, it clearly follows that Luke's 
Gospel also has come down to us in like integrity until the sacrilegious 
treatment of Marcion. In short, when Marcion laid hands on it, it then became 
diverse and hostile to the Gospels of the apostles. I will therefore advise his 
followers, that they either change these Gospels, however late to do so, into a 
conformity with their own, whereby they may seem to be in agreement with the 
apostolic writings (for they are daily retouching their work, as daily they are 
convicted by us); or else that they blush for their master, who stands 
self-condemned either way--when once he hands on the truth of the gospel 
conscience smitten, or again subverts it by shameless tampering. 
Such are the summary arguments which we use, when we take up arms against 
heretics for the faith of the gospel, maintaining both that order of periods, 
which rules that a late date is the mark of forgers, and that authority of 
churches which lends support to the tradition of the apostles; because truth 
must needs precede the forgery, and proceed straight from those by whom it has 
been handed on. 
CHAP.VI.--MARCION'S OBJECT IN ADULTERATING THE GOSPEL. NO DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN
THE CHRIST OF THE CREATOR AND THE CHRIST OF THE GOSPEL. NO RIVAL 
CHRIST
ADMISSIBLE. THE CONNECTION OF THE TRUE CHRIST WITH THE DISPENSATION OF THE 
OLD
TESTAMENT ASSERTED.
But we now advance a step further on, and challenge (as we promised to do) 
the very Gospel of Marcion, with the intention of thus proving that it has been 
adulterated. For it is certain that the whole aim at which he has strenuously 
laboured even in the drawing up of his Antitheses, centres in this, that he may 
establish a diversity between the Old and the New Testaments, so that his own 
Christ may be separate from the Creator, as belonging to this rival god, and as 
alien from the law and the prophets. It is certain, also, that with this view he 
has erased everything that was contrary to his own opinion and made for the 
Creator, as if it had been interpolated by His advocates, whilst everything 
which agreed with his own opinion he has retained. The latter statements we 
shall strictly examine; 
and if they shall turn out rather for our side, and shatter the assumption of 
Marcion, we shall embrace them. It will then become evident, that in retaining 
them he has shown no less of the defect of blindness, which characterizes 
heresy, than he displayed when he erased all the former class of subjects. 
Such, then, is to be the drift and form of my little treatise; subject, of 
course, to whatever condition may have become requisite on both sides of the 
question. Marcion has laid down the position, that Christ who in the days of 
Tiberius was, by a previously unknown god, revealed for the salvation of all 
nations, is a different being from Him who was ordained by God the Creator for 
the restoration of the Jewish state, and who is yet to come. Between these he 
interposes the separation of a great and absolute difference--as great as lies 
between what is just and what is good; as great as lies between the law and the 
gospel; as great, (in short,) as is the difference between Judaism and 
Christianity. Hence will arise also our rule, by which we determine that there 
ought to be nothing in common between the Christ of the rival god and the 
Creator; but that (Christ) must be pronounced to belong to the Creator, if He 
has administered His dispensations, fulfilled His prophecies, promoted His laws, 
given reality to His promises, revived His mighty power, remoulded His 
determinations expressed His attributes, His properties. This law and this rule 
I earnestly request the reader to have ever in his mind, and so let him begin to 
investigate whether Christ be Marcion's or the Creator's. 
CHAP.VII.--MARCION REJECTED THE PRECEDINGPORTION OF ST. LUKE'S GOSPEL. 
THEREFORE THIS REVIEW OPENS WITH AN EXAMINATION OF THE CASE OF THE EVIL SPIRIT 
IN THE SYNAGOGUE OF CAPERNAUM. HE WHOM THE DEMON ACKNOWLEDGED WAS THE
CREATOR'S CHRIST.
In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius (for such is Marcion's 
proposition) he "came down to the Galilean city of Capernaum," of course meaning 
from the heaven of the Creator, to which he had previously descended from his 
own. What then had been his Course, for him to be described as first descending 
from his own heaven to the Creator's? For why should I abstain from censuring 
those parts of the statement which do not satisfy the requirement of an ordinary 
narrative, but always end in a falsehood? To be sure, our censure has been once 
for all expressed in the question, which we have already suggested: Whether, 
when descending through the Creator's domain, and indeed in hostility to him, he 
could possibly have been admitted by him, and by him been transmitted to the 
earth, which was equally his territory? Now, however, I want also to know the 
remainder of his course down, as 
suming that he came down. For we must not be too nice in inquiring whether it 
is supposed that he was seen in any place. To come into view indicates a sudden 
unexpected glance, which for a moment fixed the eye upon the object that passed 
before the view, without staying. But when it happens that a descent has been 
effected, it is apparent, and comes under the notice of the eyes. Moreover, it 
takes account of fact, and thus obliges one to examine in what condition with 
what preparation, with how much violence or moderation, and further, at what 
time of the day or night, the descent was made; who, again, saw the descent, who 
reported it, who seriously avouched the fact, which certainly was not easy to be 
believed, even after the asseveration. It is, in short, too bad that Romulus 
should have had in Proculus an avoucher of his ascent to heaven, when the Christ 
of (this) god could not find any one to announce his descent from heaven; just 
as if the ascent of the one and the descent of the other were not effected on 
one and the same ladder of falsehood! Then, what had he to do with Galilee, if 
he did not belong to the Creator by whom that region was destined (for His 
Christ) when about to enter on His ministry? As Isaiah says: "Drink in this 
first, and be prompt, O region of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim, and ye others 
who (inhabit) the sea-coast, and that of Jordan, Galilee of the nations, ye 
people who sit in darkness, behold a great light; upon you, who inhabit (that) 
land, sitting in the shadow of death, the light hath arisen." It is, however, 
well that Marcion's god does claim to be the enlightener of the nations, that so 
he might have the better reason for coming down from heaven; only, if it must 
needs be, he should rather have made Pontus his place of descent than Galilee. 
But since both the place and the work of illumination according to the prophecy 
are compatible with Christ, we begin to discern that He is the subject of the 
prophecy, which shows that at the very outset of His ministry, He came not to 
destroy the law and the prophets, but rather to fulfil them; for Marcion has 
erased the passage as an interpolation. It will, however, be vain for him to 
deny that Christ uttered in word what He forthwith did partially indeed. For the 
prophecy about place He at once fulfilled. From heaven straight to the 
synagogue. As the adage runs: "The business on which we are come, do at once." 
Marcion must even expunge from the Gospel, "I am not sent but unto the lost 
sheep of the house of Israel;" and, "It is not meet to take the children's 
bread, and to cast it to dogs,"--in order, forsooth, that Christ may not appear 
to be an Israelite. But facts will satisfy me instead of words. Withdraw all the 
sayings of my Christ, His acts shall speak. Lo, He enters the synagogue; surely 
(this is going) to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Behold, it is to 
Israelites first that He offers the "bread" of His doctrine; surely it is 
because they are "children" that He shows them this priority. Observe, He does 
not yet impart it to others; surely He passes them by as "dogs." For to whom 
else could He better have imparted it, than to such as were strangers to the 
Creator, if He especially belonged not to the Creator? And yet how could He have 
been admitted into the synagogue--one so abruptly appearing, so unknown; one, of 
whom no one had as yet been apprised of His tribe, His nation, His family, and 
lastly, His enrolment in the census of Augustus--that most faithful witness of 
the Lord's nativity, kept in the archives of Rome? They certainly would have 
remembered, if they did not know Him to be circumcised, that He must not be 
admitted into their most holy places. And even if He had the general right of 
entering the synagogue (like other Jews), yet the function of giving instruction 
was allowed only to a man who was extremely well known, and examined and tried, 
and for some time invested with the privilege after experience duly attested 
elsewhere. But "they were all astonished at His doctrine." Of course they were; 
"for, says (St. Luke), "His word was with power--not because He taught in 
opposition to the law and the proph 0 
ets. No doubt, His divine discourse gave forth both power and grace, building 
up rather than pulling down the substance of the law and the prophets. 
Otherwise, instead of "astonishment, they would feel horror. It would not be 
admiration, but aversion, prompt and sure, which they would bestow on one who 
was the destroyer of law and prophets, and the especial propounder as a natural 
consequence of a rival god; for he would have been unable to teach anything to 
the disparagement of the law and the prophets, and so far of the Creator also, 
without premising the doctrine of a different and rival divinity, Inasmuch, 
then, as the Scripture makes no other statement on the matter than that the 
simple force and power of His word produced astonishment, it more naturally 
shows that His teaching was in accordance with the Creator by not denying (that 
it was so), than that it was in opposition to the Creator, by not asserting 
(such a fact). And thus He will either have to be acknowledged as belonging to 
Him, in accordance with whom He taught; or else will have to be adjudged a 
deceiver since He taught in accordance with One whom He had come to oppose. In 
the same passage, "the spirit of an unclean devil" exclaims: "What have we to do 
with Thee, Thou Jesus? Art Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee who Thou art, 
the Holy One of God." I do not here raise the question whether this appellation 
was suitable to one who ought not to be called Christ, unless he were sent by 
the Creator. Elsewhere there has been already given a full consideration of His 
titles. My present discussion is, how the evil spirit could have known that He 
was called by such a name, when there had never at any time been uttered about 
Him a single prophecy by a god who was unknown, and up to that time silent, of 
whom it was not possible for Him to be attested as "the Holy One," as (of a god) 
unknown even to his own Creator. What similar event could he then have published 
of a new deity, whereby he might betoken for "the holy one" of the rival god? 
Simply that he went into the synagogue, and did nothing even in word against the 
Creator? As therefore he could not by any means acknowledge him, whom he was 
ignorant of, to be Jesus and the Holy One of God; so did he acknowledge Him whom 
he knew (to be both). For he remembered how that the prophet had prophesied of 
"the Holy One" of God, and how that God's name of "Jesus" was in the son of Nun. 

These facts he had also received from the angel, according to our Gospel: 
"Wherefore that which shall be born of thee shall be called the Holy One, the 
Son of God;" and, "Thou shalt call his name Jesus." Thus he actually had 
(although only an evil spirit) some idea of the Lord's dispensation, rather than 
Of any strange and heretofore imperfectly understood one. Because he also 
premised this question: "What have we to do with Thee?"--not as if referring to 
a strange Jesus, to whom pertain the evil spirits of the Creator. Nor did he 
say, What hast Thou to do with us? but, "What have we to do with Thee?" as if 
deploring himself, and deprecating his own calamity; at the prospect of which he 
adds: "Art Thou come to destroy us?" So completely did he acknowledge in Jesus 
the Son of that God who was judicial and avenging, and (so to speak) severe, and 
not of him who was simply good, and knew not how to destroy or how to punish! 
Now for what purpose have we adduced his passage first? In order to show that 
Jesus was neither acknowledged by the evil spirit, nor affirmed by Himself, to 
be any other than the Creator's. Well, but Jesus rebuked him, you say. To be 
sure he did, as being an envious (spirit), and in his very confession only 
petulant, and evil in adulation--just as if it had been Christ's highest glory 
to have come for the destruction of demons, and not for the salvation of 
mankind; whereas His wish really was that His disciples should not glory in the 
subjection of evil spirits but in the fair beauty of salvation. Why else did He 
rebuke him? If it was because he was entirely wrong (in his invocation), then He 
was neither Jesus nor the Holy One of God; if it was because he was partially 
wrong--for having supposed him to be, rightly enough, Jesus and the Holy One of 
God, but also as belonging to the Creator--most unjustly would He have rebuked 
him for thinking what he knew he ought to think (about Him), and for not 
supposing that of Him which he knew not that he ought to suppose--that he was 
another Jesus, and the holy one of the other god. If, 
however, the rebuke has not a more probable meaning than that which we 
ascribe to it, follows that the evil spirit made no mistake, and was not rebuked 
for lying; for it was Jesus Himself, besides whom it was impossible for the evil 
spirit to have acknowledged any other, whilst Jesus affirmed that He was He whom 
the evil spirit had acknowledged, by not rebuking him for uttering a lie. 
CHAP. VIII."--OTHER PROOFS FROM THE SAME CHAPTER, THAT JESUS, WHO PREACHED 
AT
NAZARETH, AND WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY CERTAIN DEMONS AS CHRIST THE SON OF 
GOD,
WAS THE CREATOR'S CHRIST. AS OCCASION OFFERS, THE DOCETIC ERRORS OF 
MARCION
ARE EXPOSED.
The Christ of the Creator had to be called a Nazarene according to prophecy; 
whence the Jews also designate us, on that very account, Nazerenes after Him. 
For we are they of whom it is written, "Her Nazarites were whiter than snow;" 
even they who were once defiled with the stains of sin, and darkened with the 
clouds of ignorance. But to Christ the title Nazarene was destined to become a 
suitable one, from the hiding-place of His infancy, for which He went down and 
dwelt at Nazareth, to escape from Archelaus the son of Herod. This fact I have 
not refrained from mentioning on this account, because it behoved Marcion's 
Christ to have forborne all connection whatever with the domestic localities of 
the Creator's Christ, when he had so many towns in Judaea which had not been by 
the prophets thus assigned to the Creator's Christ. But Christ will be (the 
Christ) of the prophets, wheresoever He is found in accordance with the 
prophets. And yet even at Nazareth He is not remarked as having preached 
anything new, whilst in another verse He is said to have been rejected by reason 
of a simple proverb. Here at once, when I observe that they laid their hands on 
Him, I cannot help drawing a conclusion respecting His bodily substance, which 
cannot be believed to have been a phantom, since it was capable of being touched 
and even violently handled, when He was seized and taken and led to the very 
brink of a precipice. For although He escaped through the midst of them, He had 
already experienced their rough treatment, and afterwards went His way, no doubt 
because the crowd (as usually happens) gave way, or was even broken through; but 
not because it was eluded as by an impalpable disguise, which, if there had been 
such, would not at all have submitted to any touch. 
"Tangere enim et tangi, nisi corpus, nulla potest res," 
is even a sentence worthy of a place in the world's wisdom. In short, He did 
himself touch others, upon whom He laid His hands, which were capable of being 
felt, and conferred the blessings of healing, which were not less true, not less 
unimaginary, than were the hands wherewith He bestowed them. He was therefore 
the very Christ of Isaiah, the healer of our sicknesses. "Surely," says he, "He 
hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows." Now the Greeks are accustomed to 
use for carry a word which also signifies to take away. A general promise Is 
enough for me in passing. Whatever were the cures which Jesus effected, He is 
mine. We will come, however, to the kinds of cures. To liberate men, then, from 
evil spirits, is a cure of sickness. Accordingly, wicked spirits (just in the 
manner of our former example) used to go forth with a testimony, exclaiming, 
"Thou art the Son of God,"--of what God, is clear enough from the case itself. 
But they were rebuked, and ordered not to speak; precisely because Christ willed 
Himself to be proclaimed by men, not by unclean spirits, as the Son of God--even 
that Christ alone to whom this was befitting, because He had sent beforehand men 
through whom He might become known, and who were assuredly worthier preachers. 
It was natural to Him to refuse the proclamation of an unclean spirit, at whose 
command there was an abundance of saints. He, however, who had never been 
foretold (if, indeed, he wished to be acknowledged; for if he did not wish so 
much, his coming was in vain), would not have spurned the testimony of an alien 
or any sort of substance, who did not happen to have a substance of his own, but 
had descended in an alien one. And now, too, as the destroyer also of the 
Creator, he would have desired nothing better 
than to be acknowledged by His spirits, and to be divulged for the sake of 
being feared: only that Marcion says that his god is not feared; maintaining 
that a good being Is not an object of fear, but only a judicial being, in whom 
reside the grounds of fear--anger, severity, judgments, vengeance, condemnation. 
But it was from fear, undoubtedly, that the evil spirits were cowed. Therefore 
they confessed that (Christ) was the Son of a God who was to be feared, because 
they would have an occasion of not submitting if there were none for fearing. 
Besides, He showed that He was to be feared, because He drave them out, not by 
persuasion like a good being, but by command and reproof. Or else did he reprove 
them, because they were making him an object of fear, when all the while he did 
not want to be feared? 
And in what manner did he wish them to go forth, when they could not do so 
except with fear? So that he fell into the dilemma of having to conduct himself 
contrary to his nature, whereas he might in his simple goodness have at once 
treated them with leniency. He fell, too, into another false position--of 
prevarication, when he permitted himself to be feared by the demons as the Son 
of the Creator, that he might drive them out, not indeed by his own power, but 
by the authority of the Creator. "He departed, and went into a desert place." 
This was, indeed, the Creator's customary region. It was proper that the Word 
should there appear in body, where He had aforetime, wrought in a cloud. To the 
gospel also was suitable that condition of place which had once been determined 
on for the law. "Let the wilderness and the solitary place, therefore, be glad 
and rejoice;" so had Isaiah promised. When "stayed" by the crowds, He said," I 
must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also." Had He displayed His God 
anywhere yet? I suppose as yet nowhere. But was He speaking of those who knew of 
another god also? I do not believe so. If, therefore, neither He had preached, 
nor they had known, any other God but the Creator, He was announcing the kingdom 
of that God whom He knew to be the only God known to those who were listening to 
Him. 
CHAP. IX.--OUT OF ST. LUKE'S FIFTH CHAPTER ARE FOUND PROOFS OF CHRIST'S 
BELONGING TO THE CREATOR, E.G. IN THE CALL OF FISHERMEN TO THE APOSTOLIC OFFICE, 
AND IN THE CLEANSING OF THE LEPER. CHRIST COMPARED WITH THE PROPHET
ELISHA.
Out of so many kinds of occupations, why indeed had He such respect for that 
of fishermen, as to select from it for apostles Simon and the sons of Zebedee 
(for it cannot seem to be the mere fact itself for which the narrative was meant 
to be drawn out), saying to Peter, when he trembled at the very large draught of 
the fishes, "Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men?" By saying this, He 
suggested to them the meaning of the fulfilled prophecy, that it was even He who 
by Jeremiah had foretold, "Behold, I will send many fishers; and they shall fish 
them," that is, men. Then at last they left their boats, and followed Him, 
understanding that it was He who had begun to accomplish what He had declared. 
It is quite another case, when he affected to choose from the college of 
shipmasters, intending one day to appoint the shipmaster Marcion his apostle. We 
have indeed already laid it down, in opposition to his Antitheses, that the 
position of Marcion derives no advantage from the diversity which he supposes to 
exist between the Law and the Gospel, inasmuch as even this was ordained by the 
Creator, and indeed predicted in the promise of the new Law, and the new Word, 
and the new Testament. Since, however, he quotes with especial care, as a proof 
in his domain, a certain companion in misery (suntalaipwron), and 
associate in hatred (summisoumenon), with himself, for the cure of 
leprosy, I shall not be sorry to meet him, and before anything else to point out 
to him the force of the law figuratively interpreted, which, in this example of 
a leper (who was not to be touched, but was rather to be removed from all 
intercourse with others), prohibited any communication with a person who was 
defiled with sins, with whom the apostle also forbids us even to eat food, 
forasmuch as the taint of sins would be communicated as if contagious: wherever 
a man should mix himself with the sinner. The Lord, therefore, wishing that the 
law should be more profoundly understood as signifying spiritual truths by 
carnal facts--and thus not de 
stroying, but rather building up, that law which He wanted to have more 
earnestly acknowledged-touched the leper, by whom (even although as man He might 
have been defiled) He could not be defiled as God, being of course 
incorruptible. The prescription, therefore, could not be meant for Him, that He 
was bound to observe the law and not touch the unclean person, seeing that 
contact with the unclean would not cause defilement to Him. I thus teach that 
this (immunity) is consistent in my Christ, the rather when I show that it is 
not consistent in yours. Now, if it was as an enemy of the law that He touched 
the leper--disregarding the precept of the law by a contempt of the 
defilement--how could he be defiled, when he possessed not a body which could be 
defiled? For a phantom is not susceptible of defilement. He therefore, who could 
not be defiled, as being a phantom, will not have an immunity from pollution by 
any divine power, but owing to his fantastic vacuity; nor can he be regarded as 
having despised pollution, who had not in fact any material capacity for it; 
nor, in like manner, as having destroyed the law, who had escaped defilement 
from the occasion of his phantom nature, not from any display of virtue. If, 
however, the Creator's prophet Elisha cleansed Naaman the Syrian alone, to the 
exclusion of so many lepers in Israel, this fact contributes nothing to the 
distinction of Christ, as if he were in this way the better one for cleansing 
this Israelite leper, although a stranger to him, whom his own Lord had been 
unable to cleanse. The cleansing of the Syrian rather was significant throughout 
the nations of the world of their own cleansing in Christ their light, steeped 
as they were in the stains of the seven deadly sins: idolatry, blasphemy, 
murder, adultery, fornication, false-witness, and fraud. Seven times, therefore, 
as if once for each," did he wash in Jordan; both in order that he might 
celebrate the expiation of a perfect hebdomad; and because the virtue and 
fulness of the one baptism was thus solemnly imputed to Christ, alone, who was 
one day to establish on earth not only a revelation, but also a baptism, endued 
with compendious efficacy. Even Marcion finds here an antithesis: how that 
Elisha indeed required a material resource, applied water, and that seven times; 
whereas Christ, by the employment of a word only, and that but once for all, 
instantly effected the cure. And surely I might venture to claim the Very Word 
also as of the Creator's substance. There is nothing of which He who was the 
primitive Author is not also the more powerful one. Forsooth, it is incredible 
that that power of the Creator should have, by a word, produced a remedy for a 
single malady, which once by a word brought into being so vast a fabric as the 
world! From what can the Christ of the Creator be better discerned, than from 
the power of His word? But Christ is on this account another (Christ), because 
He acted differently from Elisha--because, in fact, the master is more powerful 
than his servant! Why, Marcion, do you lay down the rule, that things are done 
by servants just as they are by their very masters? Are you not afraid that it 
will turn to your discredit, if you deny that Christ belongs to the Creator, on 
the ground that He was once more powerful than a servant of the Creator--since, 
in comparison with the weakness of Elisha, He is acknowledged to be the greater, 
if indeed greater! For the cure is the same, although there is a difference in 
the working of it. What has your Christ performed more than my Elisha? Nay, what 
great thing has the word of your Christ performed, when it has simply done that 
which a river of the Creator effected? On the same principle occurs all the 
rest. So far as renouncing all human glory went, He forbade the man to publish 
abroad the cure; but so far as the honour of the law was concerned, He requested 
that the usual course should be followed: "Go, show thyself to the priest, and 
present the offering which Moses commanded." For the figurative signs of the 
law in its types He still would have observed, because of their prophetic 
import. These types signified that a man, once a sinner, but afterwards purified 
from the stains thereof by the word of God, was bound to offer unto God in the 
temple a gift, even prayer and thanksgiving in the church through Christ Jesus, 
who is the Catholic Priest of the Father. Accordingly He added: "that it may be 
for a testimony unto you"--one, no doubt, whereby He would testify that He was 
not destroying the law, but fulfilling it; whereby, too, He would testify that 
it was He Himself who was foretold as about to undertake their sicknesses and 
infirmities. This very consistent and becoming explanation of "the testimony," 
that adulator of his own Christ, Marcion seeks to exclude under the cover of 
mercy and gentleness. For, being both good (such are his words), and knowing, 
besides, that every man who had been freed from leprosy would be sure to perform 
the solemnities of the law, therefore He gave this precept. Well, what then? Has 
He continued in his goodness (that is to say, in his permission of the law) or 
not? For if he has persevered in his goodness, he will never become a destroyer 
of the law; nor will he ever be accounted as belonging to another god, because 
there would not exist that destruction of the law which would constitute his 
claim to belong to the other god. If, however, he has not continued good, by a 
subsequent destruction of the law, it is a false testimony which he has since 
imposed upon them in his cure of the leper; because he has forsaken his 
goodness, in destroying the law. If, therefore, he was good whilst upholding the 
law, he has now become evil as a destroyer of the law. However, by the support 
which he gave to the law, he affirmed that the law was good. For no one permits 
himself in the support of an evil thing. Therefore he is not only bad if he has 
permitted obedience to a bad law; but even worse still, if he has appeared as 
the destroyer of a good law. So that if he commanded the offering of the gift 
because he knew that every cured leper would be sure to bring one; he possibly 
abstained from commanding what he knew would be spontaneously done. In vain, 
therefore, was his coming down, as if with the intention of destroying the law, 
when he makes concessions to the keepers of the law. And yet, because he knew 
their disposition, he ought the more earnestly to have prevented their neglect 
of the law, since he had come for this purpose. Why then did he not keep silent, 
that man might of his own simple will obey the law? For then might he have 
seemed to some extentto have persisted in his patience. But he adds also his own 
authority increased by the weight of this "testimony." Of what testimony, I ask, 
if not that of the assertion of the law? Surely it matters not in what way he 
asserted the law--whether as good, or as supererogatory, or as patient, or as 
inconstant-provided, Marcion, I drive you from your position. Observe, he 
commanded that the law should be fulfilled. In whatever way he commanded it, in 
the same way might he also have first uttered that sentiment: "I came not to 
destroy the law, but to fulfil it." What business, therefore, had you to erase 
out of the Gospel that which was quite consistent in it? For you have confessed 
that, in his goodness, he did in act what you deny that he did in word. We have 
therefore good proof that He uttered the word, in the fact that He did the deed; 
and that you have rather expunged the Lord's word, than that our (evangelists) 
have inserted it. 
CHAP. X.--FURTHER PROOFS OF THE SAME TRUTH IN THE SAME CHAPTER, FROM 
THE
HEALING OF THE PARALYTIC, AND FROM THE DESIGNATION SON OF MAN WHICH 
JESUS
GIVES HIMSELF. TERTULLIAN SUSTAINS HIS ARGUMENT BY SEVERAL QUOTATIONS FROM 
THE
PROPHETS.
The sick of the palsy is healed, and that in public, in the sight of the 
people. For, says Isaiah, "they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the 
excellency of our God." What glory, and what excellency? "Be strong, ye weak 
hands, and ye feeble knees:" this refers to the palsy. "Be strong; fear not." Be 
strong is not vainly repeated, nor is fear not vainly added; because with the 
renewal of the limbs there was to be, according to the promise, a restoration 
also of bodily energies: "Arise, and take up thy couch;" and likewise moral 
courage not to be afraid of those who should say, "Who can forgive sins, but God 
alone?" So that you have here not only the fulfilment of the prophecy which 
promised a particular kind of healing, but also of the symptoms which followed 
the cure. In like manner, you should also recognise Christ in the same prophet 
as the forgiver of sins. "For," he says, "He shall remit to many their sins, and 
shall Himself take away our sins." For in an earlier passage, speaking in the 
person of the Lord himself, he had said: "Even though your sins be as scarlet, I 
will make them as white as snow; even though they be like crimson, I will whiten 
them as wool." In the scarlet colour He indicates the blood of the prophets; in 
the crimson, that of the Lord, as the brighter. Concerning the forgiveness of 
sins, Micah also says: "Who is a God like unto Thee? pardoning iniquity, and 
passing by the transgressions of the remnant of Thine heritage. He retaineth not 
His anger as a testimony against them, because He delighteth in mercy. He will 
turn again, and will have compassion upon us; He wipeth away our iniquities, and 
casteth our sins into the depths of the sea." Now, if nothing of this sort had 
been predicted of Christ, I should find in the Creator examples of such a 
benignity as would hold out to me the promise of similar affections also in the 
Son of whom He is the Father. I see how the Ninevites obtained forgiveness of 
their sins from the Creator--not to say from Christ, even then, because from the 
beginning He acted in the Father's name. I read, too, how that, when David 
acknowledged his sin against Uriah, the prophet Nathan said unto him, "The Lord 
hath cancelled thy sin, and thou shalt not die;" how king Ahab in like manner, 
the husband of Jezebel, guilty of idolatry and of the blood of Naboth, obtained 
pardon because of his repentance; and how Jonathan the son of Saul blotted out 
by his deprecation the guilt of a violated fast. Why should I recount the 
frequent restoration of the nation itself after the forgiveness of their 
sins?--by that God, indeed, who will have mercy rather than sacrifice, and a 
sinner's repentance rather than his death. You will first have to deny that the 
Creator ever forgave sins; then you must in reason show that He never ordained 
any such prerogative for His Christ; and so you will prove how novel is that 
boasted benevolence of the, of course, novel Christ when you shall have proved 
that it is neither compatible with the Creator nor predicted by the Creator. But 
whether to remit sins can appertain to one who is said to be unable to retain 
them, and whether to absolve can belong to him who is incompetent even to 
condemn, and whether to forgive is suitable to him against whom no offence can 
be committed, are questions which we have encountered elsewhere, when we 
preferred to drop suggestions rather than treat them anew. Concerning the Son of 
man our rule is a twofold one: that Christ cannot lie, so as to declare Himself 
the Son of man, if He be not truly so; nor can He be constituted the Son of man, 
unless He be born of a human parent, either father or mother. And then the 
discussion will turn on the point, of which human parent He ought to be 
accounted the son--of the father or the mother? Since He is (begotten) of God 
the Father, He is not, of course, (the son) of a human father. If He is not of a 
human father, it follows that He must be (the son) 
of a human mother. If of a human mother, it is evident that she must be a 
virgin. For to whom a human father is not ascribed, to his mother a husband will 
not be reckoned; and then to what mother a husband is not reckoned, the 
condition of virginity belongs. But if His mother be not a virgin, two fathers 
will have to be reckoned to Him--a divine and a human one. For she must have a 
husband, not to be a virgin; and by having a husband, she would cause two 
fathers--one divine, the other human--to accrue to Him, who would thus be Son 
both of God and of a man. Such a nativity (if one may call it so) the mythic 
stories assign to Castor or to Hercules. Now, if this distinction be observed, 
that is to say, if He be Son of man as born of His mother, because not begotten 
of a father, and His mother be a virgin, because His father is not human--He 
will be that Christ whom Isaiah foretold that a virgin should conceive, On what 
principle you, Marcion, can admit Him Son of man, I 
cannot possibly see. If through a human father, then you deny him to be Son 
of God; if through a divine one also, then you make Christ the Hercules of 
fable; if through a human mother only, then you concede my point; if not through 
a human father also, then He is not the son of any man, and He must have been 
guilty of a lie for having declared Himself to be what He was not. One thing 
alone can help you in your difficulty: boldness on your part either to surname 
your God as actually the human father of Christ, as Valentinus did with his 
AEon; or else to deny that the Virgin was human, which even Valentinus did not 
do. What now, if Christ be described in Daniel by this very title of "Son of 
man?" Is not this enough to prove that He is the Christ of prophecy? For if He 
gives Himself that appellation which was provided in the prophecy for the Christ 
of the Creator, He undoubtedly offers Himself to be understood as Him to whom 
(the appellation) was assigned by the prophet. But perhaps it can be regarded as 
a simple identity of names; and yet we have maintained that neither Christ nor 
Jesus ought to have been called by these names, if they possessed any condition 
of diversity. But as regards the appellation "Son of man," in as far as it 
Occurs by accident, in so far there is a difficulty in its occurrence along with 
a casual identity of names. For it is of pure accident, especially when the same 
cause does not appear whereby the identity may be occasioned. And therefore, if 
Marcion's Christ be also said to be born of man, then he too would receive an 
identical appellation, and there would be two Sons of man, as also two Christs 
and two Jesuses. Therefore, since the appellation is the sole right of Him in 
whom it has a suitable reason, if it be claimed for another in whom there is an 
identity of name, but not of appellation, then the identity of name even looks 
suspicious in him for whom is claimed without reason the identity of 
appellation. And it follows that He must be believed to be One and the Same, who 
is found to be the more fit to receive both the name and the appellation; while 
the other is excluded, who has no right to the appellation, because he has no 
reason to show for it. Nor will any other be better entitled to both than He who 
is the earlier, and has had allotted to Him the name of Christ and the 
appellation of Son of man, even the Jesus of the Creator. It was He who was seen 
by the king of Babylon in the furnace with His martyrs: "the fourth, who was 
like the Son of man." He also was revealed to Daniel himself expressly as "the 
Son of man, coming in the clouds of heaven" as a Judge, as also the Scripture 
shows. What I have advanced might have been sufficient concerning the 
designation in prophecy of the Son of man. But the Scripture offers me further 
information, even in the interpretation of the Lord Himself. For when the Jews, 
who looked at Him as merely man, and were not yet sure that He was God also, as 
being likewise the Son of God, rightly enough said that a man could not forgive 
sins, but God alone, why did He not, following up their point about man, answer 
them,that He had power to remit sins; inasmuch as, when He mentioned the Son of 
man, He also named a human being? except it were because He wanted, by help of 
the very designation "Son of man" from the book of Daniel, so to induce them to 
reflect as to show them that He who remitted sins was God and man--that only Son 
of man, indeed, in the prophecy of Daniel, who had obtained the power of 
judging, and thereby, of course, of forgiving sins likewise (for He who judges 
also absolves); so that, when once that objection of theirs was shattered to 
pieces by their recollection of Scripture, they might the more easily 
acknowledge Him to be the Son of man Himself by His own actual forgiveness of 
sins. I make one more observation, how that He has nowhere as yet professed 
Himself to be the Son of God--but for the first time in this passage, in which 
for the first time He has remitted sins; that is, in which for the first time He 
has used His function of judgment, by the absolution. All that the opposite side 
has to allege in argument against these things, (I beg you) carefully weigh what 
it amounts to. For it must needs strain itself to such a pitch of infatuation 
as, on the one hand, to maintain that (their Christ) is also Son of man, in 
order to save Him from the charge of falsehood; and, on the other hand, to deny 
that He was born of woman, lest they grant that He was the Virgin's son. Since, 
however, the divine authority and the nature of the case, and common sense, do 
not admit this insane position of the heretics, we have here the opportunity of 
putting in a veto in the briefest possible terms, on the substance of Christ's 
body, against Marcion's phantoms. Since He is born of man, being the Son of man. 
He is body derived from body. You may, I assure you, more easily find a man born 
without a heart or without brains, like Marcion himself, than without a body, 
like Marcion's Christ. And let this be the limit to your examination of the 
heart, or, at any rate, the brains of the heretic of Pontus. 
CHAP. XI.--THE CALL OF LEVI THE PUBLICAN. CHRIST IN RELATION TO THE 
BAPTIST. CHRIST AS THE BRIDEGROOM. THE PARABLE OF THE OLD WINE AND THE NEW. 
ARGUMENTS CONNECTING CHRIST WITH THE CREATOR.
The publican who was chosen by the Lord, he adduces for a proof that he was 
chosen as a stranger to the law and uninitiated in Judaism, by one who was an 
adversary to the law. The case of Peter escaped his memory, who, although he was 
a man of the law, was not only chosen by the Lord, but also obtained the 
testimony of possessing knowledge which was given to him by the Father. He had 
nowhere read of Christ's being foretold as the light, and hope, and expectation 
of the Gentiles! He, however, rather spoke of the Jews in a favourable light, 
when he said, "The whole needed not a physician, but they that are sick." For 
since by "those that are sick" he meant that the heathens and publicans should 
be understood, whom he was choosing, he affirmed of the Jews that they were 
"whole" for whom he said that a physician was not necessary. This being the 
case, he makes a mistake in coming down to destroy the law, as if for the remedy 
of a diseased condition. because they who were living under it were "whole," and 
"not in want of a physician." How, moreover, does it happen that he proposed the 
similitude of a physician, if he did not verify it? For, just as nobody uses a 
physician for healthy persons, so will no one do so for strangers, in so far as 
he is one of Marcion's god-made men, having to himself both a creator and 
preserver, and a specially good physician, in his Christ. This much the 
comparison predetermines, that a physician is more usually furnished by him to 
whom the sick people belong. Whence, too, does John come upon the scene? Christ, 
suddenly; and just as suddenly, John! After this fashion occur all things in 
Marcion's system. They have their own special and plenary course in the 
Creator's dispensation. Of John, however, what else I have to say will be found 
in another passage. To the several points which now come before us an answer 
must be given. This, then, I will take care to do--demonstrate that, 
reciprocally, John is suitable to Christ, and Christ to Joan, the latter, of 
course, as a prophet of the Creator, just as the former is the Creator's Christ; 
and so the heretic may blush at frustrating, to his own frustration, the mission 
of John the Baptist. For if there had been no ministry of John at all--"the 
voice," as Isaiah calls him, "of one crying in the wilderness," and the preparer 
of the ways of the Lord by denunciation and recommendation of repentance; if, 
too, he had not baptized (Christ) Himself along with others, nobody could have 
challenged the disciples of Christ, as they ate and drank, to a comparison with 
the disciples of John, who were constantly fasting and praying; because, if 
there existed any diversity between Christ and John, and their followers 
respectively, no exact comparison would be possible, nor would there be a single 
point where it could be challenged. For nobody would feel surprise, and nobody 
would be perplexed, although there should arise rival predictions of a diverse 
deity, which should also mutually differ about modes of conduct, having a prior 
difference about the authorities upon which they were based. Therefore Christ 
belonged to John, and John to Christ; while both belonged to the Creator, and 
both were of the law and the prophets, preachers and masters. Else Christ would 
have rejected the discipline of John, as of the rival god, and would also have 
defended the disciples, as very properly pursuing a different walk, because 
consecrated to the service of another and contrary deity. But as it is, while 
modestly giving a reason why "the children of the bridegroom are unable to fast 
during the 
time the bridegroom is with them," but promising that "they should afterwards 
fast, when the bridegroom was taken away from them," He neither defended the 
disciples, (but rather excused them, as if they had not been blamed without some 
reason), nor rejected the discipline of John, but rather allowed it, referring 
it to the time of John, although destining it for His own time. Otherwise His 
purpose would have been to reject it, and to defend its opponents, if He had not 
Himself already belonged to it as then in force. I hold also that it is my 
Christ who is meant by the bridegroom, of whom the psalm says: "He is as a 
bridegroom coming out of his chamber; His going forth is from the end of the 
heaven, and His return is back to the end of it again." By the mouth of Isaiah 
He also says exultingly of the Father: "Let my soul rejoice in the Lord; for He 
hath clothed me with the garment of salvation and with the tunic of joy, as a 
bridegroom. He hath put a mitre round about my head, as a bride." To Himself 
likewise He appropriates the church, concerning which the same Spirit says to 
Him: "Thou shall clothe Thee with them all, as with a bridal ornament." This 
spouse Christ invites home to Himself also by Solomon from the call of the 
Gentiles, because you read: "Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse." He elegantly 
makes mention of Lebanon (the mountain, of course) because it stands for the 
name of frankincense with the Greeks; for it was from idolatry that He betrothed 
Himself the church. Deny now, Marcion, your utter madness, (if you can)! Behold, 
you impugn even the law of your god. He unites not in the nuptial bond, nor, 
when contracted, does he allow it; no one does he baptize but a coelebs or a 
eunuch; until death or divorce does he reserve baptism. 
Wherefore, then, do you make his Christ a bridegroom? This is the designation 
of Him who united man and woman, not of him who separated them. You have erred 
also in that declaration of Christ, wherein He seems to make a difference 
between things new and old. You are inflated about the old bottles, and 
brain-muddled with the new wine; and therefore to the old (that is to say, to 
the prior) gospel you have sewed on the patch of your new-fangled heresy. I 
should like to know in what respect the Creator is inconsistent with Himself. 
When by Jeremiah He gave this precept, "Break up for yourselves new pastures," 
does He not turn away from the old state of things? And when by Isaiah He 
proclaims how "old things were passed away; and, behold, all things, which I am 
making, are new," does He not advert to a new state of things? We have generally 
been of opinion's that the destination of the former state of things was rather 
promised by the Creator, and exhibited in reality by Christ, only under the 
authority of one and the same God, to whom appertain both the old things and the 
new. For new wine is not put into old bottles, except by one who has the old 
bottles; nor does anybody put a new piece to an old garment, unless the old 
garment be forthcoming to him. That person only does not do a thing when it is 
not to be done, who has the materials wherewithal to do it if it were to be 
done. And therefore, since His object in making the comparison was to show that 
He was separating the new condition of the gospel from the old state of the law, 
He proved that that from which He was separating His own ought not to have been 
branded as a separation of things which were alien to each other; for nobody 
ever unites his own things with things that are alien to them, in order that he 
may afterwards be able to separate them from the alien things. A separation is 
possible by help of the conjunction through which it is made. Accordingly, the 
things which He separated He also proved to have been once one; as they would 
have remained, were it not for His separation. But still we make this 
concession, that there is a separation, by reformation, by amplification, by 
progress; just as the fruit is separated from the seed, although the fruit comes 
from the seed. So likewise the gospel is separated from the law, whilst it 
advances from the law--a different thing from it, but not an alien one; diverse, 
but not contrary. Nor in Christ do we even find any novel form of discourse. 
Whether He proposes simili 
tudes or refute questions, it comes from the seventy-seventh Psalm. "I will 
open," says He, "my mouth in a parable" (that is, in a similitude); "I will 
utter dark problems" (that is, I will set forth questions). If you should wish 
to prove that a man belonged to another race, no doubt you would fetch your 
proof from the idiom of his language. 
CHAP. XII.--CHRIST'S AUTHORITY OVER THE SABBATH. AS ITS LORD HE RECALLED 
IT FROM PHARISAIC NEGLECT TO THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF ITS INSTITUTION BY THE 
CREATOR THE CASE OF THE DISCIPLES WHO PLUCKED THE EARS OF CORN ON THE SABBATH. 
THE WITHERED HAND HEALED ON THE SABBATH.
Concerning the Sabbath also I have this to premise, that this question could 
not have arisen, if Christ did not publicly proclaim the Lord of the Sabbath. 
Nor could there be any discussion about His annulling the Sabbath, if He had a 
right to annul it. Moreover, He would have the right, if He belonged to the 
rival god; nor would it cause surprise to any one that He did what it was right 
for Him to do. Men's astonishment therefore arose from their opinion that it was 
improper for Him to proclaim the Creator to be God and yet to impugn His 
Sabbath. Now, that we may decide these several points first, lest we should be 
renewing them at every turn to meet each argument of our adversary which rests 
on some novel institution s of Christ, let this stand as a settled point, that 
discussion concerning the novel character of each institution ensued on this 
account, because as nothing was as yet advanced by Christ touching any new 
deity, so discussion thereon was inadmissible; nor could it be retorted, that 
from the very novelty of each several institution another deity was clearly 
enough demonstrated by Christ, inasmuch as it was plain that novelty was not in 
itself a characteristic to be wondered at in Christ, because it had been 
foretold by the Creator. And it would have been, of course, but right that a new 
god should first be expounded, and his discipline be introduced afterwards; 
because it Would be the god that would impart authority to the discipline, and 
not the discipline to the god; except that (to be sure) it has happened that 
Marcion acquired his very perverse opinions not from a master, but his master 
from his opinion! All other points respecting the Sabbath I thus rule. If Christ 
interfered with the Sabbath, He simply acted after the Creator's example; 
inasmuch as in the siege of the city of Jericho the carrying around the walls of 
the ark of the covenant for eight days running, and therefore on a Sabbath-day, 
actually annulled the Sabbath, by the Creator's command--according to the 
opinion of those who think this of Christ in this passage of St. Luke, in their 
ignorance that neither Christ nor the Creator violated the Sabbath, as we shall 
by and by show. And yet the Sabbath was actually then broken by Joshua, so that 
the present charge might be alleged also against Christ. But even if, as being 
not the Christ of the Jews, He displayed a hatred against the Jews' most solemn 
day, He was only professedly following the Creator, as being His Christ, in this 
very hatred of the Sabbath; for He exclaims by the mouth of Isaiah: "Your new 
moons and your Sabbaths my soul hateth." Now, in whatever sense these words were 
spoken, we know that an abrupt defence must, in a subject of this sort, be used 
in answer to an abrupt challenge. I shall now transfer the discussion to the 
very matter in which the teaching of Christ seemed to annul the Sabbath. The 
disciples had been hungry; on that the Sabbath day they had plucked some ears 
and rubbed them in their hands; by thus preparing their food, they had violated 
the holy day. Christ excuses them, and became their accomplice in breaking the 
Sabbath. The Pharisees bring the charge against Him. Marcion sophistically 
interprets the stages of the controversy (if I may call in the aid of the truth 
of my Lord to ridicule his arts), both in the scriptural record and in Christ's 
purpose. For from the Creator's Scripture, and from the purpose of Christ, there 
is derived a colourable precedent--as from the example of David, when he went 
into the temple on the Sabbath, and provided food by boldly breaking up the 
shew-bread. Even he remembered that this privilege (I mean the dispensation from 
fasting) was allowed to the Sabbath from the very beginning, when the 
Sabbath-day itself was instituted. For although the Creator had forbidden that 
the manna should be gathered for two days, He yet permitted it on the one 
occasion only of the day before the Sabbath, 
in order that the yesterday's provision of food might free from fasting the 
feast of the following Sabbath-day. Good reason, therefore, had the Lord for 
pursuing the same principle in the annulling of the Sabbath (since that is the 
word which men will use); good reason, too, for expressing the Creator's will, 
when He bestowed the privilege of not fasting on the Sabbath-day. In short, He 
would have then and there put an end to the Sabbath, nay, to the Creator 
Himself, if He had commanded His disciples to fast on the Sabbath-day, contrary 
to the intention of the Scripture and of the Creator's will. But because He did 
not directly defend His disciples, but excuses them; because He interposes human 
want, as if deprecating censure; because He maintains the honour of the Sabbath 
as a day which is to be free from gloom rather than from work; because he puts 
David and his companions on a level with His own disciples in their fault and 
their extenuation; because He is pleased to endorse the Creator's indulgence: 
because He is Himself good according to His example--is He therefore alien from 
the Creator? Then the Pharisees watch whether He would heal on the Sabbath-day, 
that they might accuse Him--surely as a violator of the Sabbath, not as the 
propounder of a new god; for perhaps I might be content with insisting on all 
occasions on this one point, that another Christ is nowhere proclaimed. The 
Pharisees, however, were in utter error concerning the law of the Sabbath, not 
observing that its terms were conditional, when it enjoined rest from labour, 
making certain distinctions of labour. For when it says of the Sabbath-day, "In 
it thou shalt not do any work of thine," by the word thine it restricts the 
prohibition to human work--which every one performs in his own employment or 
business--and not to divine work. Now the work of healing or preserving is not 
proper to man, but to God. So again, in the law it says, "Thou shalt not do any 
manner of work in it," except what is to be done for any soul, that is to say, 
in the matter of delivering the soul; because what is God's work may be done by 
human agency for the salvation of the soul. By God, however, would that be done 
which the man Christ was to do, for He was likewise God. Wishing, therefore, to 
initiate them into this meaning of the law by the restoration of the withered 
hand, He requires, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath-days to do good, or not? to save 
life, or to destroy it?" In order that He might, whilst allowing that amount of 
work which He was about to perform for a soul, remind them what works the law of 
the Sabbath forbade--even human works; and what it enjoined--even divine works, 
which might be done for the benefit of any soul, He was called "Lord of the 
Sabbath," because He maintained the Sabbath as His own institution. Now, even if 
He had annulled the Sabbath, He would have had the right to do so, as being its 
Lord, (and) still more as He who instituted it. But He did not utterly destroy 
it, although its Lord, in order that it might henceforth be plain that the 
Sabbath was not broken by the Creator, even at the time when the ark was carried 
around Jericho. For that was really God's work, which He commanded Himself, and 
which He had ordered for the sake of the lives of His servants when exposed to 
the perils of war. Now, although He has in a certain place expressed an aversion 
of Sabbaths, by calling them your Sabbaths, reckoning them as men's Sabbaths, 
not His own, because they were celebrated without the fear of God by a people 
full of iniquities, and loving God "with the lip, not the heart," He has yet put 
His own Sabbaths (those, that is, which were kept according to His prescription) 
in a different position; for by the same prophet, in a later passage, He 
declared them to be "true, and delightful, and inviolable." Thus Christ did not 
at all rescind the Sabbath: He kept the law thereof, and both in the former case 
did a work which was beneficial to the life of His disciples, for He indulged 
them with the relief of food when they were hungry, and in the present instance 
cured the withered hand; in each case in 
timating by facts, "I came not to destroy, the law, but to fulfil it," 
although Marcion has gagged His mouth by this word. For even in the case before 
us He fulfilled the law, while interpreting its condition; moreover, He exhibits 
in a dear light the different kinds of work, while doing what the law excepts 
from the sacredness of the Sabbath and while imparting to the Sabbath-day 
itself, which from the beginning had been consecrated by the benediction of the 
Father, an additional sanctity by His own beneficent action. For He furnished to 
this day divine safeguards,--a course which His adversary would have pursued for 
some other days, to avoid honouring the Creator's Sabbath, and restoring to the 
Sabbath the works which were proper for it. Since, in like manner, the prophet 
Elisha on this day restored to life the dead son of the Shunammite woman, you 
see, O Pharisee, and you too, O Marcion, how that it was proffer employment for 
the Creator's Sabbaths of old to do good, to save life, not to destroy it; how 
that Christ introduced nothing new, which was not after the example, the 
gentleness, the mercy, and the prediction also of the Creator. For in this very 
example He fulfils the prophetic announcement of a specific healing: "The weak 
hands are strengthened," as were also "the feeble knees"in the sick of the 
palsy. 
CHAP. XIII.--CHRIST'S CONNECTION WITH THE CREATOR SHOWN. MANY QUOTATIONS 
OUT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHETICALLY BEAR ON CERTAIN EVENTS OF THE LIFE 
OF JESUS--SUCH AS HIS ASCENT TO PRAYING ON THE MOUNTAIN; HIS SELECTION OF 
TWELVE APOSTLES; HIS CHANGING SIMON'S NAME TO PETER, AND GENTILES FROM TYRE AND 
SIDON RESORTING TO HIM.
Surely to Sion He brings good tidings, and to Jerusalem peace and all 
blessings; He goes up into a mountain, and there spends a night in prayer, and 
He is indeed heard by the Father. Accordingly turn over the prophets, and learn 
therefrom His entire course. "Into the high mountain," says Isaiah, "get Thee 
up, who bringest good tidings to Sion; lift up Thy voice with strength, who 
bringest good tidings to Jerusalem." "They were mightily astonished at His 
doctrine; for He was teaching as one who had power." And again: "Therefore, my 
people shall know my name in that day." What name does the prophet mean, but 
Christ's? "That I am He that doth speak--even I." For it was He who used to 
speak in the prophets--the Word, the Creator's Son. "I am present, while it is 
the hour, upon the mountains, as one that bringeth glad tidings of peace, as one 
that publisheth good tidings of good." So one of the twelve (minor prophets), 
Naburn: "For behold upon the mountain the swift feet of Him that bringeth glad 
tidings of peace." Moreover, concerning the voice of His prayer to the Father by 
night, the psalm manifestly says: "O my God, I will cry in the day-time, and 
Thou shalt hear; and in the night season, and it shall not be in vain to me." in 
another passage touching the same voice and place, the psalm says: 
"I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy 
mountain." You have a representation of the name; you have the action of the 
Evangelizer; you have a mountain for the site; and the night as the time; and 
the sound of a voice; and the audience of the Father: you have, (in short,) the 
Christ of the prophets. But why was it that He chose twelve apostles, and not 
some other number? In truth, I might from this very point conclude of my Christ, 
that He was foretold not only by the words of prophets, but by the indications 
of facts. For of this number I find figurative hints up and down the Creator's 
dispensation in the twelve springs of Elfin; in the twelve gems of Aaron's 
priestly vestment; and in the twelve stones appointed by Joshua to be taken out 
of the Jordan, and set up for the ark of the covenant. Now, the same number of 
apostles was thus portended, as if they were to be fountains and rivers which 
should water the Gentile world, which was formerly dry and destitute of 
knowledge (as He says by Isaiah: "I will put streams in the unwatered ground"); 
as if they were to be gems to shed lustre upon the church's sacred 
robe, which Christ, the High Priest of the Father, puts on; as if, also, they 
were to be stones massive in their faith, which the true Joshua took out of the 
layer of the Jordan, and placed in the sanctuary of His covenant. What equally 
good defence of such a number has Marcion's Christ to show? It is impossible 
that anything can be shown to have been done by him unconnectedly, which cannot 
be shown to have been done by my Christ in connection (with preceding types). To 
him will appertain the event in whom is discovered the preparation for the same. 
Again, He changes the name of Simon to peter, inasmuch as the Creator also 
altered the names of Abram, and Sarai, and Oshea, by calling the latter Joshua, 
and adding a syllable to each of the former. But why Peter? If it was because of 
the vigour of his faith, there were many solid materials which might lend a name 
from their strength. Was it because Christ was both a rock and a stone? For we 
read of His being placed "for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence." I 
omit the rest of the passage. Therefore He would fain impart to the dearest of 
His disciples a name which was suggested by one of His own especial designations 
in figure; because it was, I suppose, more peculiarly fit than a name which 
might have been derived from no figurative description of Himself. There come to 
Him from Tyre, and from other districts even, a transmarine multitude. This fact 
the psalm had in view: "And behold tribes of foreign people, and Tyre, and the 
people of the Ethiopians; they were there. Sion is my mother, shall a man say; 
and in her was born a man" (forasmuch as the God-man was born), and He built her 
by the Father's will; that you may know how Gentiles then flocked to Him, 
because He was born the God-man who was to build the church according to the 
Father's will--even of other races also. So says Isaiah too: "Behold, these come 
from far; and these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of 
the Persians." Concerning whom He says again: "Lift up thine eyes round about, 
and behold, all these have gathered themselves together." And yet again: 
"Thou seest these unknown and strange ones; and thou wilt say in thine heart, 
Who hath begotten me these? But who hath brought me up these? And these, where 
have they been?" Will such a Christ not be (the Christ) of the prophets? And 
what will be the Christ of the Marcionites? Since perversion of truth is their 
pleasure, he could not be (the Christ) of the prophets. 
CHAP. XIV.--CHRIST'S SERMON ON THE MOUNT. IN MANNER AND CONTENTS IT SO 
RESEMBLES THE CREATOR'S DISPENSATIONAL WORDS AND DEEDS. IT SUGGESTS 
THEREFORE THE CONCLUSION THAT JESUS IS THE CREATOR'S CHRIST. THE BEATITUDES.
I now come to those ordinary precepts of His, by means of which He adapts the 
peculiarity of His doctrine to what I may call His official proclamation as the 
Christ. "Blessed are the needy" (for no less than this is required for 
interpreting the word in the Greek, "because theirs is the kingdom of heaven." 
Now this very fact, that He begins with beatitudes, is characteristic of the 
Creator, who used no other voice than that of blessing either in the first fiat 
or the final dedication of the universe: for "my heart," says He, "hath indited 
a very good word." This will be that "very good word" of blessing which is 
admitted to be the initiating principle of the New Testament, after the example 
of the Old. What is there, then, to wonder at, if He entered on His ministry 
with the very attributes of the Creator, who ever in language of the same sort 
loved, consoled, protected, and avenged the beggar, and the poor, and the 
humble, and the widow, and the orphan? So that you may believe this private 
bounty as it were of Christ to be a rivulet streaming from the springs of 
salvation. Indeed, I hardly know whiCh way to turn amidst so vast a wealth of 
good words like these; as if I were in a forest, or a meadow, or an orchard of 
apples. I must therefore look out for such matter as chance may present to me. 
In the psalm he exclaims: "Defend the fatherless and the needy; do justice to 
the humble and the poor; deliver the poor, and rid the needy out of the hand of 
the wicked." 
Similarly in the seventy-first Psalm: "In righteousness shall He judge the 
needy amongst the people, and shall save the children of the poor." And in the 
following words he says of Christ: "All nations shall serve Him." Now David only 
reigned over the Jewish nation, so that nobody can suppose that this was spoken 
of David; whereas He had taken upon Himself the condition of the poor, and such 
as were oppressed with want, "Because He should deliver the needy out of the 
hand of the mighty man; He shall spare the needy and the poor, and shall deliver 
the souls of the poor. From usury and injustice shall He redeem their souls, and 
in His sight shall their name be honoured." Again: "The wicked shall be turned 
into hell, even all the nations that forget God; because the needy shall not 
alway be forgotten; the endurance of the poor shall not perish for ever." Again: 
"Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high, and yet looketh on the 
humble things that are in heaven and on earth!--who raiseth up the needy from 
off the ground, and out of the dunghill exalteth the poor; that He may set him 
with the princes of His people," that is, in His own kingdom. And likewise 
earlier, in the book of Kings, Hannah the mother of Samuel gives glory to God in 
these words: "He raiseth the poor man from the ground, and the beggar, that He 
may set him amongst the princes of His people (that is, in His own kingdom), and 
on thrones of glory" (even royal ones). And by Isaiah how He inveighs against 
the oppressors of the needy "What mean ye that ye set fire to my vineyard, and 
that the spoil of the poor is in your houses? Wherefore do ye beat my people to 
pieces, and grind the face of the needy?" And again: "Woe unto them that decree 
unrighteous decrees; for in their decrees they decree wickedness, turning aside 
the needy from judgment, and taking away their rights from the poor of my 
people." These righteous judgments He requires for the fatherless also, and the 
widows, as well as for consolation to the very needy themselves. "Do justice to 
the fatherless, and deal justly with the widow; and come, let us be reconciled, 
saith the Lord." To him, for whom in every stage of lowliness there is provided 
so much of the Creator's compassionate regard, shall be given that kingdom also 
which is promised by Christ, to whose merciful compassion belong, and for a 
great while have belonged, those to whom the promise is made. For even if you 
suppose that the promises of the Creator were earthly, but that Christ's are 
heavenly, it is quite clear that heaven has been as yet the property of no other 
God whatever, than Him who owns the earth also; quite clear that the Creator has 
given even the lesser promises (of earthly blessing), in order that I may more 
readily believe Him concerning His greater promises (of heavenly blessings) 
also, than (Marcion's god), who has never given proof of his liberality by any 
preceding bestowal of minor blessings. "Blessed are they that hunger, for they 
shall be filled." I might connect this clause with the former one, because none 
but the poor and needy suffer hunger, if the Creator had not specially designed 
that the promise of a similar blessing should serve as a preparation for the 
gospel, that so men might know it to be His. For thus does He say, by Isaiah, 
concerning those whom He was about to call from the ends of the earth--that is, 
the Gentiles: "Behold, they shall come swiftly with speed:" swiftly, because 
hastening towards the fulness of the times; with speed, because unclogged by the 
weights of the ancient law. They shall neither hunger nor thirst. Therefore they 
shall be filled,--a promise which is made to none but those who hunger and 
thirst. And again He says: "Behold, my servants shall be filled, but ye shall be 
hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty." As for these 
oppositions, we shall see whether they are not premonitors of Christ. Meanwhile 
the promise of fulness to the hungry is a provision of God the Creator. "Blessed 
are they that weep, for they shall laugh." Turn again to the passage of Isaiah: 
"Behold, my servants shall exult with joy, but ye shall be ashamed; behold, my 
servants shall be glad, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart." And recognise 
these oppositions also in the dispensation of Christ. Surely gladness and joyous 
exultation is promised to those who are in an opposite condition--to the 
sorrowful, and sad, and anxious. Just as it is said in the 125th Psalm: "They 
who sow in tears shall reap in joy." Moreover, laughter is as much an 
accessory to the exulting and glad, as weeping is to the sorrowful and 
grieving. Therefore the Creator, in foretelling matters for laughter and tears, 
was the first who said that those who mourned should laugh. 
Accordingly, He who began (His course) with consolation for the poor, and the 
humble, and the hungry, and the weeping, was at once eager to represent Himself 
as Him whom He had pointed out by the mouth of Isaiah: "The Spirit of the Lord 
is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the poor." 
"Blessed are the needy, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven." "He hath sent 
me to bind up the broken-hearted." "Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall 
be filled." "To comfort all that mourn." "Blessed are they that weep, for they 
shall laugh." "To give unto them that mourn in Sion, beauty (or glory) for 
ashes, and the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit 
of heaviness." Now since Christ, as soon as He entered on His course, fulfilled 
such a ministration as this, He is either, Himself, He who predicted His own 
coming to do all this; or else if he is not yet come who predicted this, the 
charge to Marcion's Christ must be a ridiculous one (although I should perhaps 
add a necessary one), which bade him say, "Blessed shall ye be, when men shall 
bate you, and shall reproach you, and shall cast out your name as evil, for the 
Son of man's sake." In this declaration there is, no doubt, an exhortation to 
patience. Well, what did the Creator say otherwise by Isaiah? "Fear ye not the 
reproach of men, nor be diminished by their contempt." What reproach? what 
contempt? That which was to be incurred for the sake of the Son of man. What Son 
of man? He who (is come) according to the Creator's will. Whence shall we get 
our proof? From the very cutting off, which was predicted against Him; as when 
He says by Isaiah to the Jews, who were the instigators of hatred against Him: 
"Because of you, my name is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles;" and in another 
passage: "Lay the penalty on Him who surrenders His own life, who is held in 
contempt by the Gentiles, whether servants or magistrates." Now, since hatred 
was predicted against that Son of man who has His mission from the Creator, 
whilst the Gospel testifies that the name of Christians, as derived from Christ, 
was to be hated for the Son of man's sake, because He is Christ, it determines 
the point that that was the Son of man in the matter of hatred who came 
according to the Creator's purpose, and against whom the hatred was predicted. 
And even if He had not yet come, the hatred of His name which exists at the 
present day could not in any case have possibly preceded Him who was to bear the 
name. But He has both suffered the penalty in out presence, and surrendered His 
life, laying it down for our sakes, and is held in contempt by the Gentiles. And 
He who was born (into the world) will be that very Son of man on whose account 
our name also is rejected. 
CHAP. XV.--SERMON ON THE MOUNT CONTINUED. ITS WOES IN STRICT AGREEMENT 
WITH THE CREATOR'S DISPOSITION. MANY QUOTATIONS OUT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT IN 
PROOF OF THIS.
"In the like manner," says He, "did their fathers unto the prophets." What a 
turncoat is Marcion's Christ! Now the destroyer, now the advocate of the 
prophets! He destroyed them as their rival, by converting their disciples; he 
took up their cause as their friend, by stigmatizing their persecutors. But, in 
as far as the defence of the prophets could not be consistent in the Christ of 
Marcion, who came to destroy them; in so far is it becoming to the Creator's 
Christ that He should stigmatize those who persecuted the prophets, for He in 
all things accomplished their predictions. Again, it is more characteristic of 
the Creator to upbraid sons with their fathers' sins, than it is of that god who 
chastizes no man for even his own misdeeds. But you will say, He cannot be 
regarded as defending the prophets simply because He wished to affirm the 
iniquity of the Jews for their impious dealings with their own prophets. Well, 
then, in this case, no sin ought to have been charged against the Jews: they 
were rather deserving of praise and approbation when they maltreated (24 those 
whom 
the absolutely good god of Marcion, after so long a time, bestirred himself 
to destroy. I suppose, however, that by this time he bad ceased to be the 
absolutely good god; he had now sojourned a considerable while even with the 
Creator, and was no longer (like) the god of Epicurus purely and simply. For see 
how he condescends to curse, and proves himself capable of taking offence and 
feeling anger! He actually pronounces a woe! But a doubt is raised against us as 
to the import of this word, as if it carried with it less the sense of a curse 
than of an admonition. Where, however, is the difference, since even an 
admonition is not given without the sting of a threat, especially when it is 
embittered with a woe? Moreover, both admonition and threatening will be the 
resources of him s who knows how to feel angry, For no one will forbid the doing 
of a thing with an admonition or a threat, except him who will inflict 
punishment for the doing of it. No one would inflict punishment, except him who 
was susceptible of anger. Others, again, admit that the word implies a curse; 
but they will have it that Christ pronounced the woe, not as if it were His own 
genuine feeling, but because the woe is from the Creator, and He wanted to set 
forth to them the severity of the Creator in order that He might the more 
commend His own long-suffering in His beatitudes Just as if it were not 
competent to the Creator, in the pre-eminence of both His attributes as the good 
God and Judge, that, as He had made clemency the preamble of His benediction so 
He should place severity in the sequel of His curses; thus fully developing His 
discipline in both directions, both in following out the blessing and in 
providing against the curse. He had already said of old, "Behold, I have set 
before you blessing and cursing." Which statement was really a presage of this 
temper of the gospel. Besides, what sort of being is that who, to insinuate a 
belief in his own goodness, invidiously contrasted with it the Creator's 
severity? Of little worth is the recommendation which has for its prop the 
defamation of another. And yet by thus setting forth the severity of the 
Creator, he, in fact, affirmed Him to be an object of fear. Now if He be an 
object of fear, He is of course more worthy of being obeyed than slighted; and 
thus Marcion's Christ begins to teach favourably to the Creator's interests. 
Then, on the admission above mentioned, since the woe which has regard to the 
rich is the Creator's, it follows that it is not Christ, but the Creator, who is 
angry with the rich; while Christ approves of the incentives of the rich--I 
mean, their pride, their pomp, their love of the world, and their contempt of 
God, owing to which they deserve the woe of the Creator. But how happens it that 
the reprobation of the rich does not proceed from the same Gad who had just 
before expressed approbation of the poor? There is nobody but reprobates the 
opposite of that which he has approved. If, therefore, there be imputed to the 
Creator the woe pronounced against the rich, there must be claimed for Him also 
the promise of the blessing upon the poor; and thus the entire work of the 
Creator devolves on Christ.--If to Marcion's god there be ascribed the blessing 
of the poor, he must also have imputed to him the malediction of the rich; and 
thus will he become the Creator's equal, both good and judicial; nor will there 
be left any room for that distinction whereby two gods are made; and when this 
distinction is removed, there will remain the verity which pronounces the 
Creator to be the one only God. Since, therefore, "woe" is a word indicative of 
malediction, or of some unusually austere exclamation; and since it is by Christ 
uttered against the rich, I shall have to show that the Creator is also a 
despiser of the rich, as I have shown Him to be the defender of the poor, in 
order that I may prove Christ to be on the Creator's side in this matter, even 
when He enriched Solomon. But with respect to this man, since, when a choice was 
left to him, he preferred asking for what he knew to be well-pleasing to 
God--even wisdom--he further merited the attainment of the riches, which he did 
not prefer. The endowing of a man indeed with riches, is not an incongruity to 
God, for by the help of riches even rich men are comforted and assisted; 
moreover, by them many a work of justice and charity is carried out. But yet 
there are serious faults which accompany riches; and it is because of these that 
woes are denounced on the rich, even in the Gospel. "Ye have received," says He, 
"your consolation;" that is, of course, from 
their riches, in the pomps and vanities of the world which these purchase for 
them. Accordingly, in Deuteronomy, Moses says: "Lest, when thou hast eaten and 
art full, and hast built goodly houses, and when thy herds and thy flocks 
multiply, as well as thy silver and thy gold, thine heart be then lifted up, and 
thou forget the Lord thy God." in similar terms, when king Hezekiah became proud 
of his treasures, and gloried in them rather than in God before those who had 
come on an embassy from Babylon, (the Creator) breaks forth against him by the 
mouth of Isaiah: "Behold, the days come when all that is in thine house, and 
that which thy fathers have laid up in store, shall be carried to Babylon." So 
by Jeremiah likewise did He say: "Let not the rich man glory in his riches but 
let him that glorieth even glory in the Lord." Similarly against the daughters 
of Sion does He inveigh by Isaiah, when they were haughty through their pomp and 
the abundance of their riches, just as in another passage He utters His threats 
against the proud and noble: "Hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth, 
and down to it shall descend the illustrious, and the great, and the rich (this 
shall be Christ's 'woe to the rich'); and man shall be humbled," even he that 
exalts himself with riches; "and the mighty man shall be dishonoured," even he 
who is mighty from his wealth. Concerning whom He says again: "Behold, the Lord 
of hosts shall confound the pompous together with their strength: those that are 
lifted up shall be hewn down, and such as are lofty shall fall by the sword." 
And who are these but the rich? Because they have indeed received their 
consolation, glory, and honour and a lofty position from their wealth. In Ps. 
xlviii. He also turns off our care from these and says: "Be not thou afraid when 
one is made rich, and when his glory is increased: for when he shall die, he 
shall carry nothing away; nor shall his glory descend along with him." So also 
in Ps. lxi.: "Do not desire riches; and if they do yield you their lustre, do 
not set your heart upon them." Lastly, this very same woe is pronounced of old 
by Amos against the rich, who also abounded in delights. "Woe unto them," says 
he, "who sleep upon beds of ivory, and deliciously stretch themselves upon their 
couches; who eat the kids from the flocks of the goats, and sucking calves from 
the flocks of the heifers, while they chant to the sound of the viol; as if they 
thought they should continue long, and were not fleeting; who drink their 
refined wines, and anoint themselves with the costliest ointments." Therefore, 
even if I could do nothing else than show that the Creator dissuades men from 
riches, without at the same time first condemning the rich, in the very same 
terms in which Christ also did, no one could doubt that, from the same 
authority, there was added a commination against the rich in that woe of Christ, 
from whom also had first proceeded the dissuasion against the material sin of 
these persons, that is, their riches. For such commination is the necessary 
sequel to such a dissuasive. He inflicts a woe also on "the full, because they 
shall hunger; on those too which laugh now,, because they shall mourn." To these 
will correspond these opposites which occur, as we have seen above, in the 
benedictions of the Creator: "Behold, my servants shall be full, but ye shall be 
hungry "--even because ye have been filled; "behold, my servants shall rejoice, 
but ye shall be ashamed"--even ye who shall mourn, who now are laughing. For as 
it is written in the psalm, "They who sow in tears shall reap in joy," so does 
it run in the Gospel: They who sow in laughter, that is, in joy, shall reap in 
tears. These principles did the Creator lay down of old; and Christ has renewed 
them, by simply bringing them into prominent view, not by making any change in 
them. "Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their 
fathers to the false prophets." With equal stress does the Creator, by His 
prophet Isaiah, censure those who seek after human flattery and praise: "O my 
people, they who call you happy mislead you, and disturb the paths of your 
feet." 
In another passage He forbids all implicit trust in man, and likewise in the 
applause of man; as by the prophet Jeremiah: "Cursed be the man that trusteth in 
man." Whereas in Ps. cxvii. it is said: "It is better to trust in the Lord than 
to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord than to place hope 
in princes." Thus everything which is caught at by men is adjured by the 
Creator, down to their good 
words. It is as much His property to condemn the praise and flattering words 
bestowed on the false prophets by their fathers, as to condemn their vexatious 
and persecuting treatment of the (true) prophets. As the injuries suffered by 
the prophets could not be imputed to their own God, so the applause bestowed on 
the false prophets could not have been displeasing to any other god but the God 
of the true prophets. 
CHAP. XVI.--THE PRECEPT OF LOVING ONE'S ENEMIES. IT IS AS MUCH 
TAUGHT IN THE CREATOR'S SCRIPTURES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT AS IN CHRIST'S SERMON. 
THE LEX TALIONIS OF MOSES ADMIRABLY EXPLAINED IN CONSISTENCY WITH THE KINDNESS 
AND LOVE WHICH JESUS CHRIST CAME TO PROCLAIM AND ENFORCE IN BEHALF OF THE 
CREATOR. SUNDRY PRECEPTS OF CHARITY EXPLAINED.
"But I say unto you which hear" (displaying here that old injunction, of the 
Creator: "Speak to the ears of those who lend them to you"), "Love your enemies, 
and bless those which hate you, and pray for them which calumniate you." These 
commands the Creator included in one precept by His prophet Isaiah: "Say, Ye are 
our brethren, to those who hate you." For if they who are our enemies, and hate 
us, and speak evil of us, and calumniate us, are to be called our brethren, 
surely He did in effect bid us bless them that hate us, and pray for them who 
calumniate us, when He instructed us to reckon them as brethren. Well, but 
Christ plainly teaches a new kind of patience, when He actually prohibits the 
reprisals which the Creator permitted in requiring "an eye for an eye, and a 
tooth for a tooth," and bids us, on the contrary, "to him who smiteth us on the 
one cheek, to offer the other also, and to give up our coat to him that taketh 
away our cloak." No doubt these are supplementary additions by Christ, but they 
are quite in keeping with the teaching of the Creator. And therefore this 
question must at once be determined, Whether the discipline of patience be 
enjoined by the Creator? When by Zechariah He commanded, "Let none of you 
imagine evil against his brother," He did not expressly include his neighbour; 
but then in another passage He says, "Let none of you imagine evil in your 
hearts against his neighbour." He who counselled that an injury should be 
forgotten, was still more likely to counsel the patient endurance of it. But 
then, when He said, "Vengeance is mine, and I will repay," He thereby teaches 
that patience calmly waits for the infliction of vengeance. Therefore, inasmuch 
as it is incredible that the same (God) should seem to require "a tooth for a 
tooth and an eye for an eye," in return for an injury, who forbids not only all 
reprisals, but even a revengeful thought or recollection of an injury, in so far 
does it become plain to us in what sense He required "an eye for an eye and a 
tooth for a tooth,"--not, indeed, for the purpose of permitting the repetition 
of the injury by retaliating it, which it virtually prohibited when it forbade 
vengeance; but for the purpose of restraining the injury in the first instance, 
which it had forbidden on pain of retaliation or reciprocity; so that every man, 
in view of the permission to inflict a second (or retaliatory) injury, might 
abstain from the commission of the first (or provocative) wrong. For He knows 
how much more easy it is to repress violence by the prospect of retaliation, 
than by the promise of (indefinite) vengeance. Both results, however, it was 
necessary to provide, in consideration of the nature and the faith of men, that 
the man who believed in God might expect vengeance from God, while he who had no 
faith (to restrain him) might fear the laws which prescribed retaliation. This 
purpose of the law, which it was difficult to understand, Christ, as the Lord of 
the Sabbath and of the law, and of all the dispensations of the Father, both 
revealed and made intelligible, when He commanded that "the other cheek should 
be offered (to the smiter)," in order that He might the more effectually 
extinguish all reprisals of an injury, which the law had wished to prevent by 
the method of retaliation, (and) which most certainly revelation had manifestly 
restricted, both by prohibiting the memory of the wrong, and referring the 
vengeance thereof to God. Thus, whatever (new 
provision) Christ introduced, He did it not in opposition to the law, but 
rather in furtherance of it, without at all impairing the prescription of the 
Creator. If, therefore, one looks carefully into the very grounds for which 
patience is enjoined (and trial to such a full and complete extent), one finds 
that it cannot stand if it is not the precept of the Creator, who promises 
vengeance, who presents Himself as the judge (in the case). If it were not 
so,--if so vast a weight of patience--which is to refrain from giving blow for 
blow; which is to offer the other cheek; which is not only not to return railing 
for railing, but contrariwise blessing; and which, so far from keeping the coat, 
is to give up the cloak also--is laid upon me by one who means not to help me,-- 
(then all I can say is,) he has taught me patience to no purpose, because he 
shows me no reward to his precept--I mean no fruit of such patience. There is 
revenge which he ought to have permitted me to take, if he meant not to inflict 
it himself; if he did not give me that permission, then he should himself have 
inflicted it; since it is for the interest of discipline itself that an injury 
should be avenged. For by the fear of vengeance all iniquity is curbed. But if 
licence is allowed to it without discrimination, it will get the mastery--it 
will put out (a man's) both eyes; it will knock out every tooth in the safety of 
its impunity. This, however, is (the principle) of your good and simply 
beneficent god--to do a wrong to patience, to open the door to violence, to 
leave the righteous undefended, and the wicked unrestrained! "Give to every one 
that asketh of thee"--to the indigent of course, or rather to the indigent more 
especially, although to the affluent likewise. But in order that no man may be 
indigent, you have in Deuteronomy a provision commanded by the Creator to the 
creditor. "There shall not be in thine hand an indigent man; so that the Lord 
thy God shall bless thee with blessings,"--thee meaning the creditor to whom it 
was owing that the man was not indigent. But more than this. To one who does not 
ask, He bids a gift to be given. "Let there be, not," He says, "a poor man in 
thine hand;" in other words, see that there be not, so far as thy will can 
prevent; by which command, too, He all the more strongly by inference requires 
men to give to him that asks, as in the following words also: "If there be among 
you a poor man of thy brethren, thou shalt not turn away thine heart, nor shut 
thine hand from thy poor brother. But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, 
and shalt surely lend him as much as he wanteth," Loans are not usually given, 
except to such as ask for them. On this subject of lending, however, more 
hereafter. Now, should any one wish to argue that the Creator's precepts 
extended only to a man's brethren, but Christ's to all that ask, so as to make 
the latter a new and different precept, (I have to reply) that one rule only can 
be made out of those principles, which show the law of the Creator to be 
repeated in Christ. For that is not a different thing which Christ enjoined to 
be done towards all men, from that which the Creator prescribed in favour of a 
man's brethren. For although that is a greater charity, which is shown to 
strangers, it is yet not preferable to that which was previously due to one's 
neighbours. For what man will be able to bestow the love (which proceeds from 
knowledge of character, upon strangers? Since, however, the second step in 
charity is towards strangers, while the first is towards one's neighbours, the 
second step will belong to him to whom the first also belongs, more fitly than 
the second will belong to him who owned no first. Accordingly, the Creator, when 
following the course of nature, taught in the first instance kindness to 
neighbours, intending afterwards to enjoin it towards strangers; and when 
following the method of His dispensation, He limited charity first to the Jews, 
but afterwards extended it to the whole race of mankind. So long, therefore, as 
the mystery of His government was confined to Israel, He properly commanded that 
pity should be shown only to a man's brethren; but when Christ had given to Him 
"the Gentiles for His heritage, and the ends of the earth for His possession," 
then began to be accomplished what was said by Hosea: "Ye are not my people, who 
were my people; ye have not obtained mercy, who 
once obtained mercy"--that is, the (Jewish) nation. Thenceforth Christ 
extended to all men the law of His Father's compassion, excepting none from His 
mercy, as He omitted none in His invitation. So that, whatever was the ampler 
scope of His teaching, He received it all in His heritage of the nations. "And 
as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise." In this 
command is no doubt implied its counterpart: "And as ye would not that men 
should do to you, so should ye also not do to them likewise." Now, if this were 
the teaching of the new and previously unknown and not yet fully proclaimed 
deity, who had favoured me with no instruction beforehand, whereby I might first 
learn what I ought to choose or to refuse for myself, and to do to others what I 
would wish done to myself, not doing to them what I should be unwilling to have 
done to myself, it would certainly be nothing else than the chance-medley of my 
own sentiments which he would have left to me, binding me to no proper rule of 
wish or action, in order that I might do to others what I would like for myself, 
or refrain from doing to others what I should dislike to have done to myself. 
For he has not, in fact, defined what I ought to wish or not to wish for myself 
as well as for others, so that I shape my conduct according to the law of my own 
will, and have it in my power not to render to another what I would like to have 
rendered to myself--love, obedience, consolation, protection, and such like 
blessings; and in like manner to do to another what I should be unwilling to 
have done to myself--violence, wrong, insult, deceit, and evils of like sort. 
Indeed, the heathen who have not been instructed by God act on this incongruous 
liberty of the will and the conduct. For although good and evil are severally 
known by nature, yet life is not thereby spent under the discipline of God, 
which alone at last teaches men the proper liberty of their will and action in 
faith, as in the fear of God. The god of Marcion, therefore, although specially 
revealed, was, in spite of his revelation, unable to publish any summary of the 
precept in question, which had hitherto been so confined, and obscure, and dark, 
and admitting of no ready interpretation, except according to my own arbitrary 
thought, because he had provided no previous discrimination in the matter of 
such a precept. This, however, was not the case with my God, for He always and 
everywhere enjoined that the poor, and the orphan, and the widow should be 
protected, assisted, refreshed; thus by Isaiah He says: "Deal thy bread to the 
hungry, and them that are houseless bring into thine house; when thou seest the 
naked, cover him." By Ezekiel also He thus describes the just man: "His bread 
will he give to the hungry, and the naked will he cover with a garment." That 
teaching was even then a sufficient inducement to me to do to others what I 
would that they should do unto me. Accordingly, when He uttered such 
denunciations as, "Thou shalt do no murder; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou 
shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness," He taught me to refrain 
from doing to others what I should be unwilling to have done to myself; and 
therefore the precept developed in the Gospel will belong to Him alone, who 
anciently drew it up, and gave it distinctive point, and arranged it after the 
decision of His own teaching, and has now reduced it, suitably to its 
importance, to a compendious formula, because (as it was predicted in another 
passage) the Lord--that is, Christ" was to make (or utter) a concise word on 
earth." 
CHAP. XVII.--CONCERNING LOANS. PROHIBITION OF USURY AND THE USURIOUS 
SPIRIT. THE LAW PREPARATORY TO THE GOSPEL IN ITS PROVISIONS; SO IN THE PRESENT 
INSTANCE. ON REPRISALS. CHRIST'S TEACHING THROUGHOUT PROVES HIM TO BE SENT 
BY THE CREATOR.
And now, on the subject of a loan, when He asks, "And if ye lend to them of 
whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye?" compare with this the following 
words of Ezekiel, in which He says of the before-mentioned just man, "He hath 
not given his money upon usury, nor will he take any increase"--meaning the 
redundance of interest, which is usury. The first step was to eradicate the 
fruit of the money lent, the more easily to accustom a man to the loss, should 
it happen, of the money itself, the in 
terest of which he had learnt to lose. Now this, we affirm, was the function 
of the law as preparatory to the gospel. It was engaged in forming the faith of 
such as would learn, by gradual stages, for the perfect light of the Christian 
discipline, through the best precepts of which it was capable, 
inculcating a benevolence which as yet expressed itself but falteringly. 
For in the passage of Ezekiel quoted above He says, "And thou shalt restore 
the pledge of the loan "--to him, certainly, who is incapable of repayment, 
because, as a matter of course, He would not anyhow prescribe the restoration of 
a pledge to one who was solvent. Much more clearly is it enjoined in 
Deuteronomy: "Thou shalt not sleep upon his pledge; thou shalt be sure to return 
to him his garment about sunset, and he shall sleep in his own garment." Clearer 
still is a former passage: "Thou shalt remit every debt which thy neighbour 
oweth thee; and of thy brother thou shalt not require it, because it is called 
the release of the Lord thy God." Now, when He commands that a debt be remitted 
to a man who shall be unable to pay it (for it is a still stronger argument when 
He forbids its being asked for from a man who is even able to repay it), what 
else does He teach than that we should lend to those of whom we cannot receive 
again, inasmuch as He has imposed so great a loss on lending? "And ye shall be 
the children of God." What can be more shameless, than for him to be making us 
his children, who has not permitted us to make children for ourselves by 
forbidding marriage? How does he propose to invest his followers with a name 
which he has already erased? I cannot be the son of a eunuch Especially when I 
have for my Father the same great Being whom the universe claims for its! For is 
not the Founder of the universe as much a Father, even of all men, as 
(Marcion's) castrated deity, who is the maker of no existing thing? Even if the 
Creator had not united male and female, and if He had not allowed any living 
creature whatever to have children, I yet had this relation to Him before 
Paradise, before the fall, before the expulsion, before the two became one. 
I became His son a second time, as soon as He fashioned me with His hands, 
and gave me motion with His inbreathing. Now again He names me His son, not 
begetting me into natural life, but into spiritual life. "Because," says He, "He 
is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil." Well done, Marcion! how cleverly 
have you withdrawn from Him the showers and the sunshine, that He might not seem 
to be a Creator! But who is this kind being which hitherto has not been even 
known? How can he be kind who had previously shown no evidences of such a 
kindness as this, which consists of the loan to us of sunshine and rain?--who is 
not destined to receive from the human race (the homage due to that) 
Creator,--who, up to this very moment, in return for His vast liberality in the 
gift of the elements, bears with men while they offer to idols, more readily 
than Himself, the due returns of His graciousness. But God is truly kind even in 
spiritual blessings. "The utterances of the Lord are sweeter than honey and 
honeycombs." He then has taunted men as ungrateful who deserved to have their 
gratitude--even He, whose sunshine and rain even you, O Marcion, have enjoyed, 
but without gratitude! Your god, however, had no right to complain of man's 
ingratitude, because he had used no means to make them grateful. Compassion also 
does He teach: "Be ye merciful," says He, "as your Father also that had mercy 
upon you." This injunction will be of a piece with, "Deal thy bread to the 
hungry; and if he be houseless, bring him into thine house; and if thou seest 
the naked, cover him;" also with, "Judge the fatherless, plead with the widow." 
I recognise here that ancient doctrine of Him who "prefers mercy to sacrifice." 
If, however, it be now some other being which teaches mercy, on the ground of 
his own mercifulness, how happens it that he has been wanting in mercy to me for 
so vast an age? "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye 
shall not be condemned; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be 
given unto you: good measure, pressed down, and running over, shall men give 
into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye meas 
ure withal, it shall be measured to you again." As it seems to me, this 
passage announces a retribution proportioned to the merits. But from whom shall 
come the retribution? If only from men, in that case he teaches a merely human 
discipline and recompense; and in everything we shall have to obey man: if from 
the Creator, as the Judge and the Recompenser of merits, then He compels our 
submission to Him, in whose hands He has placed a retribution which will be 
acceptable or terrible according as every man shall have judged or condemned, 
acquitted or dealt with, his neighbour; if from (Marcion's god) himself, he will 
then exercise a judicial function which Marcion denies. Let the Marcionites 
therefore make their choice: Will it not be just the same inconsistency to 
desert the prescription of their master, as to have Christ teaching in the 
interest of men or of the Creator? But "a blind man will lead a blind man into 
the ditch." Some persons believe Marcion. But "the disciple is not above his 
master." Apelles ought to have remembered this--a corrector of Marcion, although 
his disciple. The heretic ought to take the beam out of his own eye, and then he 
may convict the Christian, should he suspect a mote to be in his eye. Just as a 
good tree cannot produce evil fruit, so neither can truth generate heresy; and 
as a corrupt tree cannot yield good fruit, so heresy will not produce truth. 
Thus, Marcion brought nothing good out of Cerdon's evil treasure; nor Apelles 
out of Marcion's. For in applying to these heretics the figurative words which 
Christ used of men in general, we shall make a much more suitable interpretation 
of them than if we were to deduce out of them two gods, according to Marcion's 
grievous exposition. I think that I have the best reason possible for insisting 
still upon the position which I have all along occupied, that in no passage to 
be anywhere found has another God been revealed by Christ. I wonder that in this 
place alone Marcion's hands should have felt benumbed in their adulterating 
labour. But even robbers have their qualms now and then. There is no wrong-doing 
without fear, because there is none without a guilty conscience. So long, then, 
were the Jews cognisant of no other god but Him, beside whom they knew none 
else; nor did they call upon any other than Him whom alone they knew. This being 
the case, who will He clearly be that said, "Why tallest thou me Lord, Lord?" 
Will it be he who had as yet never been called on, because never yet revealed; 
or He who was ever regarded as the Lord, because known from the beginning--even 
the God of the Jews? Who, again, could possibly have added, "and do not the 
things which I say?" Could it have been he who was only then doing his best to 
teach them? Or He who from the beginning had addressed to them His messages both 
by the law and the prophets? He could then upbraid them with disobedience, even 
if He had no ground at any time else for His reproof. The fact is, that He who 
was then imputing to them their ancient obstinacy was none other than He who, 
before the coming of Christ, had addressed to them these words, "This people 
honoureth me with their lips, but their heart standeth far off from me." 
Otherwise, how absurd it were that a new god, a new Christ, the revealer of a 
new and so grand a religion should denounce as obstinate and disobedient those 
whom he had never had it in his power to make trial of! 
CHAP. XVIII.--CONCERNING THE CENTURION'S FAITH. THE RAISING OF THE 
WIDOW'S
SON. JOHN BAPTIST, AND HIS MESSAGE TO CHRIST; AND THE WOMAN WHO WAS A 
SINNER.
PROOFS EXTRACTED FROM ALL OF THE RELATION OF CHRIST TO THE CREATOR.
Likewise, when extolling the centurion's faith, how incredible a thing it is, 
that He should confess that He had "found so great a faith not even in Israel." 
to whom Israel's faith was in no way interesting! But not from the fact (here 
stated by Christ) could it have been of any interest to Him to approve and 
compare what was hitherto crude, nay, I might say, hitherto naught. Why, 
however, might He not have used the example of faith in another god? Because, 
if He had done so, He would have said that no such faith had ever had 
existence in Israel; but as the case stands, He intimates that He ought to have 
found so great a faith in Israel, inasmuch as He had indeed come for the purpose 
of finding it, being in truth the God and Christ of Israel, and had now 
stigmatized it, only as one who would enforce and Uphold it. If, indeed, He had 
been its antagonist, He would have preferred finding it to be such faith, having 
come to weaken and destroy it rather than to approve of it. He raised also the 
widow's son from death. This was not a strange miracle. The Creator's prophets 
had wrought such; then why not His Son much rather? Now, so evidently had the 
Lord Christ introduced no other god for the working of so momentous a miracle as 
this, that all who were present gave glory to the Creator, saying: "A great 
prophet is risen up among us, and God hath visited His people." What God? He, of 
course, whose people they were, and from whom had come their prophets. But if 
they glorified the Creator, and Christ (on hearing them, and knowing their 
meaning) refrained from correcting them even in their very act of invoking the 
Creator in that vast manifestation of His glory in this raising of the dead, 
undoubtedly He either announced no other God but Him, whom He thus permitted to 
be honoured in His own beneficent acts and miracles, or else how happens it that 
He quietly permitted these persons to remain so long in their error, especially 
as He came for the very purpose to cure them of their error? But John is 
offended when he hears of the miracles of Christ, as of an alien god. Well, I on 
my side will first explain the reason of his offence, that I may the more easily 
explode the scandal of our heretic. Now, that the very Lord Himself of all 
might, the Word and Spirit of the Father, was operating and preaching on earth, 
it was necessary that the portion of the Holy Spirit which, in the form of the 
prophetic gift, had been through John preparing the ways of the Lord, should now 
depart from John, and return back again of course to the Lord, as to its 
all-embracing original. Therefore John, being now an ordinary person, and only 
one of the many, was offended indeed as a man, but not because he expected or 
thought of another Christ as teaching or doing nothing new, for he was not even 
expecting such a one. Nobody will entertain doubts about any one whom (since he 
knows him not to exist) he has no expectation or thought of. Now John was quite 
sure that there was no other God but the Creator, even as a Jew, especially as a 
prophet. Whatever doubt he felt was evidently rather entertained about Him whom 
he knew indeed to exist but knew not whether He were the very Christ. With this 
fear, therefore, even John asks the question, "Art thou He that should come, or 
look we for another?"--simply inquiring whether He was come as He whom he was 
looking for. "Art thou He that should come?" i.e. Art thou the coming One? "or 
look we for another?" i.e. Is He whom we are expecting some other than Thou, if 
Thou art not He whom we expect to come? For he was supposing, as all men then 
thought, from the similarity of the miraculous evidences, that a prophet might 
possibly have been meanwhile sent, from whom the Lord Himself, whose coming was 
then expected, was different, and to whom He was superior. And there lay John's 
difficulty. He was in doubt whether He was actually come whom all men were 
looking for; whom, moreover, they ought to have recognised by His predicted 
works, even as the Lord sent word to John, that it was by means of these very 
works that He was to be recognised. 
Now, inasmuch as these predictions evidently related to the Creator's 
Christ--as we have proved in the examination of each of them--it was perverse 
enough, if he gave himself 
out to be not the Christ of the Creator, and rested the proof of his 
statement on those very evidences whereby he was urging his claims to be 
received as the Creator's Christ. Far greater still is his perverseness when, 
not being the Christ of John, he yet bestows on John his testimony, affirming 
him to be a prophet, nay more, his messenger, applying to him the Scripture, 
"Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before 
thee." He graciously adduced the prophecy in the superior sense of the 
alternative mentioned by the perplexed John, in order that, by affirming that 
His own precursor was already come in the person of John, He might quench the 
doubt which lurked in his question: "Art thou He that, should come, or look we 
for another?" Now that the forerunner had fulfilled his mission, and the way of 
the Lord was prepared, He ought now to be acknowledged as that (Christ) for whom 
the forerunner had made ready the way. That forerunner was indeed "greater than 
all of women born;" but for all that, He who was least in the kingdom of God was 
not subject to him; as if the kingdom in which the least person was greater than 
John belonged to one God, while John, who was greater than all of women born, 
belonged himself to another God. For whether He speaks of any "least person" by 
reason of his humble position, or of Himself, as being thought to be less than 
John--since all were running into the wilderness after John rather than after 
Christ ("What went ye out into the wilderness to see?")--the Creator has equal 
right to claim as His own both John, greater than any born of women, and Christ, 
or every "least person in the kingdom of heaven," who was destined to be greater 
than John in that kingdom, although equally pertaining to the Creator, and who 
would be so much greater than the prophet, because he would not have been 
offended at Christ, as infirmity which then lessened the greatness John.We have 
already spoken of the forgiveness of sins. The behaviour of "the woman which was 
a sinner," when she covered the Lord's feet with her kisses, bathed them with 
her tears, wiped them with the hairs of her head, anointed them with ointment, 
produced an evidence that what she handled was not an empty phantom, but a 
really solid body, and that her repentance as a sinner deserved forgiveness 
according to the mind of the Creator, who is accustomed to prefer mercy to 
sacrifice. But even if the stimulus of her repentance proceeded from her faith, 
she heard her justification by faith through her repentance pronounced in the 
words, "Thy faith hath saved thee," by Him who had declared by Habakkuk, "The 
just shall live by his faith." 
CHAP. XIX.--THE RICH WOMEN OF PIETY WHO FOLLOWED JESUS CHRIST'S TEACHING 
BY PARABLES. THE MARCIONITE CAVIL DERIVED FROM CHRIST'S REMARK, WHEN TOLD OF HIS 
MOTHER AND HIS BRETHREN. EXPLANATION OF CHRIST'S APPARENT REJECTION THEM.
The fact that certain rich women clave to Christ, "which ministered unto Him 
of their substance," amongst whom was the wife of the king's steward, is a 
subject of prophecy. By Isaiah the Lord called these wealthy ladies--"Rise up, 
ye women that are at ease, and hear my voice"--that He might prove them first as 
disciples, and then as assistants and helpers: "Daughters, hear my words in 
hope; this day of the year cherish the memory of, in labour with hope." For it 
was "in labour" that they followed Him, and "with hope" did they minister to 
Him. On the subject of parables, let it suffice that it has been once for all 
shown that this kind of language was with equal distinctness promised by the 
Creator. But there is that direct mode of His speaking to the people"Ye shall 
hear with the ear, but ye shall not understand"--which now claims notice as 
having furnished to Christ that frequent form of His earnest instruction: "He 
that hath ears to hear, let him hear." Not as if Christ, actuated with a diverse 
spirit, permitted a hearing which the Creator had refused; but because the 
exhortation followed the threatening. First came, "Ye shall hear with the ear, 
but shall not understand;" then followed, "He that hath ears to hear, let him 
hear." For they wilfully refused to hear, although they had ears. He, however, 
was teaching them that it was the ears of the heart which were necessary; and 
with these the Creator had said that they would not hear. Therefore it is that 
He adds by His Christ, "Take heed how ye hear," and hear not,--meaning, of 
course, with the hearing of the heart, not of the ear. If you only attach a 
proper, sense to the Creator's admonition suitable to the meaning of Him who was 
rousing the people to hear by the words, "Take heed how ye hear," it amounted to 
a menace to such as would not hear. In fact, that most merciful god of yours, 
who judges not, neither is angry, is minatory. This is proved even by the 
sentence which immediately follows: "Whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and 
whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have." 
What shall be given? The increase of faith, or understanding, or even salvation. 
What shall be taken away? That, of course, which shall be, given. By whom shall 
the gift and the deprivation be made? If by the Creator it be taken away, by Him 
also shall it be given. If by Marcion's god it be given, by Marcion's god also 
will it be taken away. Now, for whatever reason He threatens the "deprivation," 
it will not be the work of a god who knows not how to threaten, because 
incapable of anger. I am, moreover, astonished when he says that "a candle is 
not usually hidden," who had hidden himself--a greater and more needful 
light--during so long a time; and when he promises that "everything shall be 
brought out of its secrecy and made manifest," who hitherto has kept his god in 
obscurity, waiting (I suppose) until Marcion be born. We now come to the most 
strenuously-plied argument of all those who call in question the Lord's 
nativity. They say that He testifies Himself to His not having been born, when 
He asks, "Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?" In this manner heretics 
either wrest plain and simple words to any sense they choose by their 
conjectures, or else they violently resolve by a literal interpretation words 
which imply a conditional sense and are incapable of a simple solution, as in 
this passage. We, for our part, say in reply, first, that it could not possibly 
have been told Him that His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to 
see Him, if He had had no mother and no brethren. They must have been known to 
him who announced them, either some time previously, or then at that very time, 
when they desired to see Him, or sent Him their message. To this our first 
position this answer is usually given by the other side. But suppose they sent 
Him the message for the purpose of tempting Him? Well, but the Scripture does 
not say so; and inasmuch as it is usual for it to indicate what is done in the 
way of temptation ("Behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him;"again, 
when inquiring about tribute, the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him), so, when 
it makes no mention of temptation, it does not admit the interpretation of 
temptation. However, although I do not allow this sense, I may as well ask, by 
way of a superfluous refutation, for the reasons of the alleged temptation, To 
what purpose could they have tempted Him by naming His mother and His brethren? 
If it was to ascertain whether He had been born or not--when was a question 
raised on this point, which they must resolve by tempting Him in this way? Who 
could doubt His having been born, when they saw Him before them a veritable 
man?--whom they had heard call Himself "Son of man?"--of whom they doubted 
whether He were God or Son of God, from seeing Him, as they did, in the perfect 
garb of human quality?--supposing Him rather to be a prophet, a great one 
indeed, but still one who had been born as man? Even if it had been necessary 
that He should thus be tried in the investigation of His birth, surely any other 
proof would have better answered the trial than that to be obtained from 
mentioning those relatives which it was quite possible for Him, in spite of His 
true nativity, not at that moment to have had. For tell me now, does a mother 
live on contemporaneously with her sons in every case? Have all sons brothers 
born for them? May a man rather not have fathers and sisters (living), 
or even no relatives at all? But there is historical proof that at this very 
time a census had been taken in Judaea by Sentius Saturni-nus, which might have 
satisfied their inquiry respecting the family and descent of Christ. Such a 
method of testing the point had therefore no consistency whatever in it and they 
"who were standing without" were really "His mother and His brethren." It 
remains for us to examine His meaning when He resorts to non-literal words, 
saying "Who is my mother or my brethren?" It seems as if His language amounted 
to a denial of His family and His birth; but it arose actually from the absolute 
nature of the case, and the conditional sense in which His words were to be 
explained. He was justly indignant, that persons so very near to Him" stood 
without," while strangers were within hanging on His words, especially as they 
wanted to call Him away from the solemn work He had in hand. He did not so much 
deny as disavow them. And therefore, when to the previous question, "Who is my 
mother, and who are my brethren? He added the answer "None but they who hear my 
words and do them," He transferred the names of blood-relationship to others, 
whom He judged to be more closely related to Him by reason of their faith. Now 
no one transfers a thing except from him who possesses that which is 
transferred. If, therefore, He made them "His mother and His brethren" who were 
not so, how could He deny them these reIationships who really had them? Surely 
only on the condition of their deserts, and not by any disavowal of His near 
relatives; teaching them by His own actual example, that "whosoever preferred 
father or mother or brethren to the Word of God, was not a disciple worthy of 
Him." Besides, His admission of His mother and His brethren was the more 
express, from the fact of His unwillingness to acknowledge them. That He adopted 
others only confirmed those in their relationship to Him whom He refused because 
of their offence, and for whom He substituted the others, not as being truer 
relatives, but worthier ones. Finally, it was no great matter if He did prefer 
to kindred (that) faith which it did not possess. 
CHAP. XX.--COMPARISON OF CHRIST'S POWER OVER WINDS
AND WAVES WITH MOSES' COMMAND OF THE WATERS OF
THE RED SEA AND THE JORDAN. CHRIST'S POWER OVER UNCLEAN
SPIRITS. THE CASE OF THE LEGION THE CURE OF THE ISSUE OF
BLOOD. THE MOSAIC UNCLEANNESS ON THIS POINT EXPLAINED.
But "what manner of man is this? for He commandeth even the winds and water!" 
Of course He is the new master and proprietor of the elements, now that the 
Creator is deposed, and excluded from their possession! Nothing of the kind. But 
the elements own their own Maker, just as they had been accustomed to obey His 
servants also. Examine well the Exodus, Marcion; look at the rod of Moses, as it 
waves His command to the Red Sea, ampler than all the lakes of Judaea. How the 
sea yawns from its very depths, then fixes itself in two solidified masses, and 
so, out of the interval between them, makes a way for the people to pass 
dry-shod across; again does the same red vibrate, the sea returns in its 
strength, and in the concourse of its waters the chivalry of Egypt is engulphed! 
To that consummation the very winds subserved! 
Read, too, how that the Jordan was as a sword, to hinder the emigrant nation 
in their passage across its stream; how that its waters from above stood still, 
and its current below wholly ceased to run at the bidding of Joshua, when his 
priests began to pass over! 
What will you say to this? If it be your Christ that is meant say he will not 
be more potent than the servants of the Creator. But I should have been content 
with the examples I have adduced without addition, if a prediction of His 
present passage on the sea had not preceded Christ's coming. As psalm is, in 
fact, accomplished by this crossing over the lake. "The Lord," says the 
psalmist, "is upon many waters." When He disperses its waves, Habakkuk's words 
are fulfilled, where he says, "Scattering the waters in His passage." When at 
His rebuke the sea is calmed, Nahum is also verified: He rebuketh the sea, and 
maketh it dry," including the winds indeed, whereby it was disquieted. With what 
evidence would you have my Christ vindicated? 
Shall it come from the examples, or from the prophecies, of the Creator? You 
suppose that He is predicted as a military and armed warrior, instead of one who 
in a figurative and allegorical sense was to wage a spiritual warfare against 
spiritual enemies, in spiritual campaigns, and with spiritual weapons: 
come now, when in one man alone you discover a multitude of demons calling 
itself Legion, of course comprised of spirits, you should learn that Christ also 
must be understood to be an exterminator of spiritual foes, who wields spiritual 
arms and fights in spiritual strife; and that it was none other than He, who now 
had to contend with even a legion of demons. Therefore it is of such a war as 
this that the Psalm may evidently have spoken: "The Lord is strong, The Lord is 
mighty in battle." For with the last enemy death did He fight, and through the 
trophy of the cross He triumphed. Now of what God did the Legion testify that 
Jesus was the Son? No doubt, of that God whose torments and abyss they knew and 
dreaded. It seems impossible for them to have remained up to this time in 
ignorance of what the power of the recent and unknown god was working in the 
world, because it is very unlikely that the Creator was ignorant thereof. For if 
He had been at any time ignorant that there was another god above Himself, He 
had by this time at all events discovered that there was one at work below His 
heaven. Now, what their Lord had discovered had by this time become notorious to 
His entire family within the same world and the same circuit of heaven, in which 
the strange deity dwelt and acted. As therefore both the Creator and His 
creatures must have had knowledge of him, if he had been in existence, so, 
inasmuch as he had no existence, the demons really knew none other than the 
Christ of their own God. They do not ask of the strange god, what they 
recollected they must beg of the Creator--not to be plunged into the Creator's 
abyss. They at last had their request granted. On what ground? Because they had 
lied? Because they had proclaimed Him to be the Son of a ruthless God? And what 
sort of god will that be who helped the lying, and upheld his detractors? 
However, no need of this thought, for, inasmuch as they had not lied, inasmuch 
as they had acknowledged that the God of the abyss was also their God, so did He 
actually Himself affirm that He was the same whom these demons 
acknowledged--Jesus, the Judge and Son of the avenging God. Now, behold an 
inkling of the Creator's failings and infirmities in Christ; for I on my side 
mean to impute to Him ignorance. Allow me some indulgence in my effort against 
the heretic. Jesus is touched by the woman who had an issue of blood, He knew 
not by whom. "Who touched me?" He asks, when His disciples alleged an excuse. He 
even persists in His assertion of ignorance: "Somebody hath touched me," He 
says, and advances some proof: "For I perceive that virtue is gone out of me." 
What says our heretic? Could Christ have known the person? And why did He speak 
as if He were ignorant? Why? Surely it was to challenge her faith, and to try 
her fear. Precisely as He had once questioned Adam, as if in ignorance: Adam, 
where art thou?" Thus you have both the Creator excused in the same way as 
Christ, and Christ acting similarly to the Creator. But in this case He acted as 
an adversary of the law; and therefore, as the law forbids contact with a woman 
with an issue, He desired not only that this woman should touch Him, but that He 
should heal her. Here, 
then, is a God who is not merciful by nature, but in hostility! Yet, if we 
find that such was the merit of this woman's faith, that He said unto her, Thy 
faith hath saved thee." what are you, that you should detect an hostility to the 
law in that act, which the Lord Himself shows us to have been done as a reward 
of faith? But will you have it that this faith of the woman consisted in the 
contempt which she had acquired for the law? Who can suppose, that a woman who 
had been. hitherto unconscious of any God, uninitiated as yet in any new law, 
should violently infringe that law by which she was up to this time bound? On 
what faith, indeed, was such an infringement hazarded? In what God believing? 
Whom despising? The Creator? Her touch at least was an act of faith. And if of 
faith in the Creator, how could she have violated His law, when she was ignorant 
of any other God? Whatever her infringement of the law amounted to, it proceeded 
from and was proportionate to her faith in the Creator. But how can these two 
things be compatible? That she violated the law, and violated it in faith, which 
ought to have restrained her from such violation? I will tell you how her faith 
was this above all: it made her believe that her God preferred mercy even to 
sacrifice; she was certain that her God was working in Christ; she touched Him, 
therefore, nor as a holy man simply, nor as a prophet, whom she knew to be 
capable of contamination by reason of his human nature, but as very God, whom 
she assumed to be beyond all possibility of pollution by any uncleanness. She 
therefore, not without reason, interpreted for herself the law, as meaning that 
such things as are susceptible of defilement become defiled, but not so God, 
whom she knew for certain to be in Christ. But she recollected this also, that 
what came under the prohibition of the law was that ordinary and usual issue of 
blood which proceeds from natural functions every month, and in childbirth, not 
that which was the result of disordered health. Her case, however, was one of 
long abounding ill health, for which she knew that the succour of God's mercy 
was needed, and not the natural relief of time. And thus she may: evidently be 
regarded as having discerned the law, instead of breaking it. This will prove to 
be the faith which was to confer intelligence likewise. "If ye will not 
believe," says (the prophet), "ye shall not understand." When Christ approved of 
the faith of this woman, which simply rested in the Creator, He declared by His 
answer to her, that He was Himself the divine object of the faith of which He 
approved. Nor can I overlook the fact that His garment, by being touched, 
demonstrated also the truth of His body; for of course" it was a body, and not a 
phantom, which the garment clothed. This indeed is not our point now; but the 
remark has a natural bearing on the question we are discussing. For if it were 
not a veritable body, but only a fantastic one, it could not for certain have 
received contamination, as being an unsubstantial thing. He therefore, who, by 
reason of this vacuity of his substance, was incapable of contamination, how 
could he possibly have desired this touch? As an adversary of the law, his 
conduct was deceitful, for he was not susceptible of a real pollution. 
CHAP. XXI.--CHRIST'S CONNECTION WITH THE CREATOR SHOWN FROM SEVERAL
INCIDENTS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, COMPARED WITH ST. LUKE'S NARRATIVE OF 
THE
MISSION OF THE DISCIPLES. THE FEEDING OF THE MUL-
TITUDE. THE CONFESSION OF ST. PETER.
BEING ASHAMED OF CHRIST. THIS SHAME IS
ONLY POSSIBLE OF THE TRUE CHRIST. MARCIONITE PRETENSIONS ABSURD.
He sends forth His disciples to preach the kingdom of God. Does He here say 
of what God? He forbids their taking anything for their journey, by way of 
either food or raiment. Who would have given such a commandment as this, but He 
who feeds the ravens and clothes the flowers of the field? Who anciently 
enjoined for the treading ox an unmuzzled mouth, that he might be at liberty to 
gather his fodder from his labour, on the principle that the worker is worthy of 
his hire? Marcion may expunge such precepts, but no matter, provided the sense 
of them survives. But when He charges them to shake off the dust of their feet 
against such as should refuse to receive them, He also bids that this be done as 
a witness. Now no one bears witness except in a case which is decided by 
judicial process; and whoever orders inhuman conduct to be submitted to the 
trial by testi 
mony, does really threaten as a judge. Again, that it was no new god which 
recommended by Christ, was dearly attested by the opinion of all men, because 
some maintained to Herod that Jesus was the Christ; others, that He was John; 
some, that He was Elias; and others, that He was one of the old prophetss. Now, 
whosoever of all these He might have been, He certainly was not raised up for 
the purpose of announcing another god after His resurrection. He feeds the 
multitude in the desert place; this, you must knows was after the manner of the 
Old Testament. Or else, if there was not the same grandeur, it follows that He 
is now inferior to the Creator. For He, not for one day, but during forty years, 
not on the inferior aliment of bread and fish, but with the manna of heaven, 
supported the lives of not five thousand, but of six hundred thousand human 
beings. However, such was the greatness of His miracle, that He willed the 
slender supply of food, not only to be enough, but even to prove superabundant; 
and herein He followed the ancient precedent. For in like manner, during the 
famine in Elijah's time, the scanty and final meal of the widow of Sarepta was 
multiplied by the blessing of the prophet throughout the period of the famine. 
You have the third book of the Kings. If you also turn to the fourth book, you 
will discover all this conduct of Christ pursued by that man of God, who ordered 
ten barley loaves which had been given him to be distributed among the people; 
and when his servitor, after contrasting the large number of the persons with 
the small supply of the food, answered, "What, shall I set this before a hundred 
men?" he said again, "Give them, and they shall eat: for thus saith the Lord, 
They shall eat, and shall leave thereof, according to the word of the Lord." O 
Christ, even in Thy novelties Thou art old! Accordingly, when Peter, who had 
been an eye-witness of the miracle, and had compared it with the ancient 
precedents, and had discovered in them prophetic intimations of what should one 
day come to pass, answered (as the mouthpiece of them all) the Lord's inquiry, 
"Whom say ye that I am?" in the words, "Thou art the Christ," he could not but 
have perceived that He was that Christ, beside whom he knew of none else in the 
Scriptures, and whom he was now surveying in His wonderful deeds. This 
conclusion He even Himself confirms by thus far bearing with it, nay, even 
enjoining silence respecting it. For if Peter was unable to acknowledge Him to 
be any other than the Creator's Christ, while He commanded them "to tell no man 
that saying," surely He was unwilling to have the conclusion promulged which 
Peter had drawn. No doubt of that, you say; but as Peter's conclusion was a 
wrong one, therefore He was unwilling to have a lie disseminated. It was, 
however, a different reason which He assigned for the silence, even because "the 
Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and scribes, 
and priests, and be slain, and be raised again the third day." Now, inasmuch as 
these sufferings were actually foretold for the Creator's Christ (as we shall 
fully show in the proper place), so by this application of them to His own case 
does He prove that it is He Himself of whom they were predicted. At all events, 
even if they had not been predicted, the reason which He alleged for imposing 
silence (on the disciples) was such as made it clear enough that Peter had made 
no mistake, that reason being the necessity of His undergoing these sufferings. 
"Whosoever," says He, "will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will 
lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it." Surely it is the Son of man 
who uttered this sentence. Look carefully, then, along with the king of Babylon, 
into his burning fiery furnace, and there you will discover one "like the Son of 
man" (for He was not yet really Son of man, because not yet born of man), even 
as early as then appointing issues such as these. He saved the lives of the 
three brethren, who had agreed to lose them for God's sake; but He destroyed 
those of the Chaldaeans, when they had preferred to save them by the means of 
their idolatry. Where is that novelty, which you pretend in a doctrine which 
possesses these ancient proofs? But all the predictions have been fulfilled 
concerning martydoms which were to happen, and were to receive 
the recompenses of their reward from God. "See," says Isaiah, "how the 
righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and just men are taken away, 
and no man considereth." When does this more frequently happen than in the 
persecution of His saints? This, indeed, is no ordinary matter, no common 
casualty of the law of nature; but it is that illustrious devotion, that 
fighting for the faith, wherein whosoever loses his life for God saves it, so 
that you may here again recognize the Judge who recompenses the evil gain of 
life with its destruction, and the good loss thereof with its salvation. It is, 
however, a jealous God whom He here presents to me one who returns evil for 
evil. "For whosoever," says He, "shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be 
ashamed." Now to none but my Christ can be assigned the occasion of such a shame 
as this. His whole course was so exposed to shame as to open a way for even the 
taunts of heretics, declaiming with all the bitterness in their power against 
the utter disgrace of His birth and bringing-up, and the unworthiness of His 
very flesh. But how can that Christ of yours be liable to a shame, which it is 
impossible for him to experience? Since he was never condensed into human flesh 
in the womb of a woman, although a virgin; never grew from human seed, although 
only after the law of corporeal substance, from the fluids of a woman; was never 
deemed flesh before shaped in the womb; never called foetus after such shaping; 
was never delivered from a ten months' writhing in the womb; was never shed 
forth upon the ground, amidst the sudden pains of parturition, with the unclean 
issue which flows at such a time through the sewerage of the body, forthwith to 
inaugurate the light of life with tears, and with that primal wound which severs 
the child from her who bears him; never received the copious ablution, nor the 
meditation of salt and honey; nor did he initiate a shroud with swaddling 
clothes; nor afterwards did he ever wallow in his own uncleanness, in his 
mother's lap; nibbling at her breast; long an infant; gradually a boy; by slow 
degrees a man. But he was revealed from heaven, full-grown at once, at once 
complete; immediately Christ; simply spirit, and power, and god. But as withal 
he was not true, because not visible; therefore he was no object to be ashamed 
of from the curse of the cross, the real endurance of which he escaped, because 
wanting in bodily substance. Never, therefore, could he have said, "Whosever 
shall be ashamed of me." But as for our Christ, He could do no otherwise than 
make such a declaration; "made" by the Father "a little lower than the angels," 
"a worm and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people;" seeing that 
it was His will that "with His stripes we should be healed," that by His 
humiliation our salvation should be established. And justly did He humble 
Himself for His own creature man, for the image and likeness of Himself, and not 
of another, in order that man, since he had not felt ashamed when bowing down to 
a stone or a stock, might with similar courage give satisfaction to God for the 
shamelessness of his idolatry, by displaying an equal degree of shamelessness in 
his faith, in not being ashamed of Christ. Now, Marcion, which of these courses 
is better suited to your Christ, in respect of a meritorious shame? Plainly, you 
ought yourself to blush with shame for having given him a fictitious existence. 
CHAP. XXII.--THE SAME CONCLUSION SUPPORTED BY THE TRANSFIGURATION. 
MARCION
INCONSISTENT IN ASSOCIATING WITH CHRIST IN GLORY TWO SUCH EMINENT SERVANTS 
OF
THE CREATOR AS MOSES AND ELIJAH. ST. PETER'S IGNORANCE ACCOUNTED FOR 
ON
MONTANIST PRINCIPLE.
You ought to be very much ashamed of 
yourself on this account too, for permitting him to appear on the retired 
mountain in the company of Moses and Elias, whom he had come to destroy. This, 
to be sure, was what he wished to be understood as the meaning of that voice 
from heaven: "This is my beloved Son, hear Him"--Him, that is, not Moses or 
Elias any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display of 
Moses and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear, he must 
have forbidden all others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and 
Jeremiah and the others whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he 
prohibited those whom he did display? Now, even if their presence was necessary, 
they surely should not be represented as conversing together, which is a sign of 
familiarity; nor as associated in glory with him, for this indicates respect and 
graciousness; but they should be shown in some slough as a sure token of their 
ruin, or even in that darkness of the Creator which Christ was sent to disperse, 
far removed from the glory of Him who was about to sever their words and 
writings from His gospel. This, then, is the way how he demonstrates them to be 
aliens, even by keeping them in his own company! This is how he shows they ought 
to be relinquished: he associates them with himself instead! This is how he 
destroys them: he irradiates them with his glory! How would their own Christ 
act? I suppose He would have imitated the frowardness (of heresy), and revealed 
them just as Marcion's Christ was bound to do, or at least as having with Him 
any others rather than His own prophets! But what could so well befit the 
Creator's Christ, as to manifest Him in the company of His own 
foreannouncers?--to let Him be seen with those to whom He had appeared in 
revelations?--to let Him be speaking with those who had spoken of Him?--to share 
His glory with those by whom He used to be called the Lord of glory; even with 
those chief servants of His, one of whom was once the moulder of His people, the 
other afterwards the reformer thereof; one the initiator of the Old Testament, 
the other the consummator of the New? Well therefore does Peter, when 
recognizing the companions of his Christ in their indissoluble connection with 
Him, suggest an expedient: "It is good for us to be here" (good: that evidently 
means to be where Moses and EIias are); "and let us make three tabernacles, one 
for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. But he knew not what he said." 
How knew not? Was his ignorance the result of simple error? Or was it on the 
principle which we maintain in the cause of the new prophecy, that to grace 
ecstasy. or rapture is incident. For when a man is rapt in the Spirit, 
especially when he beholds the glory of God, or when God speaks through him, he 
necessarily loses his sensation, because he is overshadowed with the power of 
God,--a point concerning which there is a question between us and the 
carnally-minded. Now, it is no difficult matter to prove the rapture of Peter. 
For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the Spirit? 
People could not have had their images, or statues, or likenesses; for that the 
law forbade. How, if it were not that he had seen them in the Spirit? And 
therefore, because it was in the Spirit that he had now spoken, and not in his 
natural senses, he could not know what he had said. But if, on the other hand, 
he was thus ignorant, because he erroneously supposed that (Jesus) was their 
Christ, it is then evident that Peter, when previously asked by Christ, "Whom 
they thought Him to be," meant the Creator's Christ, when he answered, "Thou art 
the Christ;" because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival 
god, he would not have made a mistake here. But if he was in error here cause of 
his previous erroneous opinion, then you may be sure that up to that very day no 
new divinity had been revealed by Christ, and that Peter had so far made no 
mistake, because hitherto Christ had revealed nothing of the kind; and that 
Christ accordingly was not to be regarded as belonging to any other 
than the Creator, whose entire dispensation he, in fact, here described. He 
selects from His disciples three witnesses of the impending vision and voice. 
And this is just the way of the Creator. "In the mouth of three witnesses," says 
He, "shall every word be established." He withdraws to a mountain. In the nature 
of the place I see much meaning. For the Creator had originally formed His 
ancient people on a mountain both with visible glory and His voice. It was only 
tight that the New Testament should be attested on such an elevated spot as that 
whereon the Old Testament had been composed; under a like covering of cloud 
also, which nobody will doubt, was condensed out of the Creator's air. Unless, 
indeed, he had brought down his own clouds thither, because he had himself 
forced his way through the Creator's heaven; or else it was only a precarious 
cloud, as it were, of the Creator which he used. On the present (as also on the 
former) occasion, therefore, the cloud was not silent; but there was the 
accustomed voice from heaven, and the Father's testimony to the Son; precisely 
as in the first Psalm He had said, "Thou art my Son, today have I begotten 
thee." By the mouth of Isaiah also He had asked concerning Him, "Who is there 
among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son." When therefore 
He here presents Him with the words, "This is my (beloved) Son," this clause is 
of course understood, "whom I have promised." For if He once promised, and then 
afterwards says, "This is He," it is suitable conduct for one who accomplishes 
His purpose that He should utter His voice in proof of the promise which He had 
formerly made; but unsuitable in one who is amenable to the retort, Can you, 
indeed, have a right to say, "This is my son," concerning whom you have given us 
no previous information, any more than you have favoured us with a revelation 
about your own prior existence? "Hear ye Him," therefore, whom from the 
beginning (the Creator) had declared entitled to be heard in the name of a 
prophet, since it was as a prophet that He had to be regarded by the people. "A 
prophet," says Moses, "shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your sons" 
(that is, of course, after a carnal descent; "unto Him shall ye hearken, as unto 
me." "Every one who will not hearken unto Him, his soul shall be cut off from 
amongst his people.", So also Isaiah: "Who is there among you that feareth God? 
Let him hear the voice of His Son." This voice the Father was going Himself to 
recommend. For, says he, He establishes the words of His Son, when He says, 
"This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him." Therefore, even if there be made a 
transfer of the obedient "heating" from Moses and Elias to Christ, it is still 
not from another God, or to another Christ; but from" the Creator to His Christ, 
in consequence of the departure of the old covenant and the supervening of the 
new. "Not an ambassador, nor an angel, but He Himself," says Isaiah, "shall save 
them;" for it is He Himself who is now declaring and fulfilling the law and the 
prophets. The Father gave to the Son new disciples, after that Moses and Elias 
had been exhibited along with Him in the honour of His glory, and had then been 
dismissed as having fully discharged their duty and office, for the express 
purpose of affirming for Marcion's information the fact that Moses and Elias had 
a share in even the glory of Christ. But we have the entire structure of this 
same vision in Habakkuk also, where the Spirit in the person of some of the 
apostles says, "O Lord, I have heard Thy speech, and was afraid." What speech 
was this, other than the words of the voice from heaven, This is my beloved Son, 
hear ye, Him? "I considered thy works, and was astonished." When could this have 
better happened than when Peter, on seeing His glory, knew not what he was 
saying? "In the midst of the two Thou shalt be known"--even Moses and 
Elias. These likewise did Zechariah see under the figure of the two olive 
trees and olive branches. For these are they of whom he says, "They are the two 
anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth." And again Habakkuk 
says, "His glory covered the heavens" (that is, with that cloud), "and His 
splendour shall be like the light--even the light, wherewith His very raiment 
glistened." And if we would make mention of the promise to Moses, we shall find 
it accomplished here. For when Moses desired to see the Lord, saying, "If 
therefore I have found grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself to me, that I may 
see Thee distinctly," the sight which he desired to have was of that condition 
which he was to assume as man, and which as a prophet he knew was to occur. 
Respecting the face of God, however, he had already heard, "No man shall see me, 
and live." "This thing," said He, "which thou hast spoken, will I do unto thee." 
Then Moses said, "Show me Thy glory." And the Lord, with like reference to the 
future, replied, "I will pass before thee in my glory," etc. Then at the last He 
says, "And then thou shall see my back." Not loins, or calves of the legs, did 
he want to behold, but the glory which was to be revealed in the latter days. He 
had promised that He would make Himself thus face to face visible to him, when 
He said to Aaron, "If there shall be a prophet among you, I will make myself 
known to him by vision, and by vision will I speak with him; but not so is my 
manner to Moses; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently" (that is 
to say, in the form of man which He was to assume), "and not in dark speeches." 
Now, although Marcion has denied that he is here represented as speaking with 
the Lord, but only as standing, yet, inasmuch as he stood "mouth to mouth," he 
must also have stood "face to face" with him, to use his words, not far from 
him, in His very glory--not to say, in His presence. And with this glory he went 
away enlightened from Christ, just as he used to do from the Creator; as then to 
dazzle the eyes of the children of Israel, so now to smite those of the blinded 
Marcion, who has failed to see how this argument also makes against him. 
CHAP. XXIII.--IMPOSSIBLE THAT MARCION'S CHRIST SHOULD REPROVE THE 
FAITHLESS GENERATION. SUCH LOVING CONSIDERATION FOR INFANTS AS THE TRUE CHRIST 
WAS APT
TO SHEW, ALSO IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE OTHER. ON THE THREE DIFFERENT 
CHARACTERS CONFRONTED AND INSTRUCTED BY CHRIST SAMARIA.
I take on myself the character of Israel. Let Marcion's Christ stand forth, 
and exclaim, "O faithless generation! how long shall I be with you? how long 
shall I suffer you?" He will immediately have to submit to this remonstrance 
from me: "Whoever you are, O stranger, first tell us who you are, from whom you 
come, and what right you have over us. Thus far, all you possess belongs to the 
Creator. Of course, if you come from Him, and are acting for Him, we will bear 
your reproof. But if you come from some other god, I should wish you to tell us 
what you have ever committed to us belonging to yourself, which it was our duty 
to believe, seeing that you are upbraiding us with 'faithlessness,' who have 
never yet revealed to us your own self. How long ago did you begin to treat with 
us, that you should be complaining of the delay? On what points have you borne 
with us, that you should adduce your patience? Like AEsop's ass, you are just 
come from the well, and are filling every place with your braying." I assume, 
besides, the person of the disciple, against whom he has inveighed: "O perverse 
nation! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?" This 
outburst of his I might, of course, retort upon him most justly in such words as 
these: "Whoever you are, O stranger, first tell us who you are, from whom you 
come, what right you have over us. Thus far, I suppose, you belong to the 
Creator, and so we have followed you, recognising in you all things which are 
His. Now, if you come from Him, we will bear your reproof. If, however, you are 
acting for another, prythee tell us what you have ever conferred upon us that is 
simply your own, which it had become our duty to believe, seeing that you 
reproach us with 'faithlessness,' although up to this moment you show us no 
credentials. How long since did you begin to plead with us, that you are 
charging us with delay? Wherein have you borne with us, that you should even 
boast of your patience? The ass has only just arrived from AEsop's well, and he 
is already braying." Now who would not thus have rebutted the unfairness of the 
rebuke, if he had supposed its author to belong to him who had had no right as 
yet to complain? Except that not even He would have inveighed against them, if 
He had not dwelt among them of old in the law and by the prophets, and with 
mighty deeds and many mercies, and had always experienced them to be 
"faithless." But, behold, Christ takes infants, and teaches how all ought to be 
like them, if they ever wish to be greater. The Creator, on the contrary, let 
loose bears against children, in order to avenge His prophet Elisha, who had 
been mocked by them. This antithesis is impudent enough, since it throws 
together things so different as infants and children,--an age still innocent, 
and one already capable of discretion--able to mock, if not to blaspheme. As 
therefore God is a just God, He spared not impious children, exacting as He does 
honour for every time of life, and especially, of course, from youth. And as God 
is good, He so loves infants as to have blessed the midwives in Egypt, when they 
protected the infants of the Hebrews which were in peril from Pharaoh's command. 
Christ therefore shares this kindness with the Creator. As indeed for Marcion's 
god, who is an enemy to marriage, how can he possibly seem to be a lover of 
little children, which are simply the issue of marriage? He who hates the seed 
must needs also detest the fruit. Yea, he ought to be deemed more ruthless than 
the king of Egypt. For whereas Pharaoh forbade infants to be brought up, he will 
not allow them even to be born, depriving them of their ten months' existence in 
the womb. And how much more credible it is, that kindness to little children 
should be attributed to Him who blessed matrimony for the procreation of 
mankind, and in such benediction included also the promise of connubial fruit 
itself, the first of which is that of infancy! The Creator, at the request of 
Elias, inflicts the blowof fire from heaven in the case of that false prophet 
(of Baalzebub). I recognise herein the severity of the Judge. And I, on the 
contrary, the severe rebuke of Christ on His disciples, when they were for 
inflicting a like visitation on that obscure village of the Samaritans. The 
heretic, too, may discover that this gentleness of Christ was promised by the 
selfsame severest Judge. "He shall not contend," says He, "nor shall His voice 
be heard in the street; a bruised reed shall He not crush, and smoking flax 
shall He not quench." Being of such a character, He was of course much the less 
disposed to burn men. For even at that time the Lord said to Elias, "He was not 
in the fire, but in the still small voice." Well, but why does this most humane 
and merciful God reject the man who offers himself to Him as an inseparable 
companion? If it were from pride or from hypocrisy that he had said, "I will 
follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest,' then, by judicially reproving an act of 
either pride or hypocrisy as worthy of rejection, He performed the office of a 
Judge. And, of course, him whom He rejected He condemned to the loss of not 
following the Saviour. For as He calls to salvation him whom He does not reject, 
or him whom He voluntarily invites, so does He consign to perdition him whom He 
rejects. When, however, He answers the man, who alleged as an excuse his 
father's burial, "Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the 
kingdom of God," He gave a clear confirmation to those two laws of the 
Creator--that in Leviticus, which concerns the sacerdotal office, and forbids 
the priests to be present at the funerals even of their parents. "The priest," 
says He, "shall not enter where there is any dead person; and for his father he 
shall not be defiled"; as well as that in Numbers, which relates to the 
(Nazarite) vow of separation; for there he who devotes himself to God, among 
other things, is bidden "not to come at any dead body," not even of his father, 
or his mother, or his brother. Now it was, I suppose, for the Nazarite and the 
priestly office that He intended this man whom 
He had been inspiring to preach the kingdom of God. Or else, if it be not so, 
he must be pronounced impious enough who, without the intervention of any 
precept of the law, commanded that burials of parents should be neglected by 
their sons. When, indeed, in the third case before us, (Christ) forbids the man 
"to look back" who wanted first "to bid his family farewell," He only follows 
out the rule of the Creator. For this (retrospection) He had been against their 
making, whom He had rescued out of Sodom. 
CHAP. XXIV.--ON THE MISSION OF THE SEVENTY DISCIPLES, AND CHRIST'S CHARGE 
TO THEM. PRECEDENTS DRAWN FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT. ABSURDITY OF SUPPOSING THAT 
MARCION'S CHRIST COULD HAVE GIVEN THE POWER OF TREADING ON SERPENTS AND 
SCORPIONS.
He chose also seventy other missionaries besides the twelve. Now why, if the 
twelve followed the number of the twelve fountains of Elim, should not the 
seventy correspond to the like number of the palms of that place? Whatever be 
the Antitheses of the comparison, it is a diversity in the causes, not in the 
powers, which has mainly produced them. But if one does not keep in view the 
diversity of the causes, he is very apt to infer a difference of powers. When 
the children of Israel went out of Egypt, the Creator brought them forth laden 
with their spoils of gold and silver vessels, and with loads besides of raiment 
and unleavened dough; whereas Christ commanded His disciples not to carry even a 
staff for their journey. The former were thrust forth into a desert, but the 
latter were sent into cities. Consider the difference presented in the 
occasions, and you will understand how it was one and the same power which 
arranged the mission of His people according to their poverty in the one case, 
and their plenty in the other. He cut down their supplies when they could be 
replenished through the cities, just as He had accumulated" them when exposed to 
the scantiness of the desert. Even shoes He forbade them to carry. For it was He 
under whose very protection the people wore not out a shoe, even in the 
wilderness for the space of so many years. "No one," says He, "shall ye salute 
by the way." What a destroyer of the prophets, forsooth, is Christ, seeing it is 
from them that He received his precept also! When Elisha sent on his servant 
Gehazi before him to raise the Shunammite's son from death, I rather think he 
gave him these instructions: "Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine 
hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute 
thee, answer him not again." For what is a wayside blessing but a mutual 
salutation as men meet? So also the Lord commands: "Into whatsoever house they 
enter, let them say, Peace be to it." Herein He follows the very same example. 
For Elisha enjoined upon his servant the same salutation when he met the 
Shunammite; he was to say to her: "Peace to thine husband, peace to thy child." 
Such will be rather our Antitheses; they compare Christ with, instead of 
sundering Him from, the Creator. "The labourer is worthy of his hire." Who could 
better pronounce such a sentence than the Judge? For to decide that the workman 
deserves his wages, is in itself a judicial act. There is no award which 
consists not in process of judgment. The law of the Creator on this point also 
presents us with a corroboration, for He judges that labouring oxen are as 
labourers worthy of their hire: "Thou shall not muzzle," says He. "the ox when 
he treadeth out the corn." Now, who so good to man as He who is also merciful to 
cattle? Now, when Christ pronounced labourers to be worthy of their hire, He, in 
fact, exonerated from blame that precept of the Creator about depriving the 
Egyptians of their gold and silver vessels. For they who had built for the 
Egyptians their houses and cities, were surely workmen worthy of their hire, and 
were not instructed in a fraudulent act, but only set to claim compensation for 
their hire, which they were unable in any other way to exact from their masters. 
That the kingdom of God was neither new nor unheard of, He in this way affirmed, 
whilst at the same time He bids them announce that it was near at hand. Now it 
is that which 
was once far off, which can be properly said to have become near. If, 
however, a thing had never existed previous to its becoming near, it could never 
have been said to have approached, because it had never existed at a distance. 
Everything which is new and unknown is also sudden. Everything which is sudden, 
then, first receives the accident of time when it is announced, for it then 
first puts on appearance of form. Besides it will be impossible for a thing 
either to have been tardy all the while it remained unannounced, or to have 
approached from the time it shall begin to be announced. 
He likewise adds, that they should say to such as would not receive them: 
"Notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh 
unto you." If He does not enjoin this by way of a commination, the injunction is 
a most useless one. For what mattered it to them that the kingdom was at hand, 
unless its approach was accompanied with judgment?--even for the salvation of 
such as received the announcement thereof. How, if there can be a threat without 
its accomplishment, can you have in a threatening god, one that executes also, 
and in both, one that is a judicial being? So, again, He commands that the dust 
be shaken off against them, as a testimony,--the very particles of their ground 
which might cleave to the sandal, not to mention any other sort of communication 
with them. But if their churlishness and inhospitality were to receive no 
vengeance from Him, for what purpose does He premise a testimony, which surely 
forbodes some threats? Furthermore, when the Creator also, in the book of 
Deuteronomy, forbids the reception of the Ammonites and the Moabites into the 
church, because, when His people came from Egypt, they fraudulently withheld 
provisions from them with inhumanity and inhospitality, it will be manifest that 
the prohibition of intercourse descended to Christ from Him. The form of it 
which He uses--"He that despiseth you, despiseth me"--the Creator had also 
addressed to Moses: "Not against thee have they murmured, but against me." 
Moses, indeed, was as much an apostle as the apostles were prophets. The 
authority of both offices will have to be equally divided, as it proceeds from 
one and the same Lord, (the God) of apostles and prophets. Who is He that shall 
bestow "the power of treading on serpents and scorpions?" Shall it be He who is 
the Lord of all living creatures or he who is not god over a single lizard? 
Happily the Creator has promised by Isaiah to give this power even to little 
children, of putting their hand in the cockatrice den and on the hole of the 
young asps without at all receiving hurt. And, indeed, we are aware (without 
doing violence to the literal sense of the passage, since even these noxious 
animals have actually been unable to do hurt where there has been faith) that 
under the figure of scorpions and serpents are portended evil spirits, whose 
very prince is described by the name of serpent, dragon, and every other most 
conspicuous beast in the power of the Creator. This power the Creator conferred 
first of all upon His Christ, even as the ninetieth Psalm says to Him: "Upon the 
asp and the basilisk shall Thou tread; the lion and the dragon shall Thou 
trample under foot." So also Isaiah: "In that day the Lord God shall draw His 
sacred, great, and strong sword" (even His Christ) "against that dragon, that 
great and tortuous serpent; and He shall slay him in that day." But when the 
same prophet says, "The way shall be called a clean and holy way; over it the 
unclean thing shall not pass, nor shall be there any unclean way; but the 
dispersed shall pass over it, and they shall not err therein; no lion shall be 
there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon; it shall not be found there," 
he points out the way of faith, by which we shall reach to God; and then to this 
way of faith he promises this utter crippling and subjugation of all noxious 
animals. Lastly, you may discover the suitable times of the promise, if you read 
what precedes the passage: "Be strong, ye weak hands and ye feeble knees: then 
the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear; then 
shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be 
articulate." When, therefore, He proclaimed the benefits of His cures, then also 
did He put the scorpions and the 
serpents under the feet of His saints--even He who had first received this 
power from the Father, in order to bestow it upon others and then manfested it 
forth conformably to the order of prophecy. 
CHAP. XXV.--CHRIST THANKS THE FATHER FOR REVEALING TO BABES WHAT HE HAD 
CONCEALED FROM THE WISE. THIS CONCEALMENT JUDICIOUSLY EFFECTED BY THE CREATOR. 
OTHER POINTS IN ST. LUKE'S CHAP. X. SHOWN TO BE ONLY POSSIBLE TO THE 
CREATOR'S
CHRIST.
Who shall be invoked as the Lord of heaven, that does not first show Himself 
to have been the maker thereof? For He says, "I thank thee, (O 
Father,)and own Thee, Lord of heaven, because those things which had been 
hidden from the wise and prudent, Thou has revealed unto babes." What things are 
these? And whose? And by whom hidden? And by whom revealed? If it was by 
Marcion's god that they were hidden and revealed, it was an extremely iniquitous 
proceeding; for nothing at all had he ever produced in which anything could have 
been hidden--no prophecies, no parables, no visions, no evidences of things, or 
words, or names, obscured by allegories and figures, or cloudy enigmas, but he 
had concealed the greatness even of himself, which he was with all his might 
revealing by his Christ. Now in what respect had the wise and prudent done 
wrong, that God should be hidden from them, when their wisdom and prudence had 
been insufficient to come to the knowledge of Him? No way had been provided by 
himself, by any declaration of his works, or any vestiges whereby they might 
become wise and prudent. 
However, if they had even failed in any duty towards a god whom they knew 
not, suppose him now at last to be known still they ought not to have found a 
jealous god in him who is introduced as unlike the Creator. Therefore, since he 
had neither provided any materials in which he could have hidden anything, nor 
had any offenders from whom he could have hidden himself: since, again, even if 
he had had any, he ought not to have hidden himself from them, he will not now 
be himself the revealer, who was not previously the concealer; so neither will 
any be the Lord of heaven nor the Father of Christ but He in whom all these 
attributes consistently meet. For He conceals by His preparatory apparatus of 
prophetic obscurity, the understanding of which is open to faith (for "if ye 
will not believe, ye shall not understand"; and He had offenders in those wise 
and prudent ones who would not seek after God, although He was to be discovered 
in His so many and mighty works, or who rashly philosophized about Him, and 
thereby furnished to heretics their arts; and lastly, He is a jealous God. 
Accordingly, that which Christ thanks God for doing, He long ago announced by 
Isaiah: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the 
prudent will I hide." So in another passage He intimates both that He has 
concealed, and that He will also reveal: "I will give unto them treasures that 
have been hidden, and secret ones will I discover to them." And again: "Who else 
shall scatter the tokens of ventriloquists, and the devices of those who divine 
out of their own heart; turning wise men backward, and making their counsels 
foolish?" Now, if He has designated His Christ as an enlightener of the 
Gentiles, saying, "I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles;" and if we 
understand these to be meant in the word babes--as having been once dwarfs in 
knowledge and infants in prudence, and even now also babes in their lowliness of 
faith--we shall of course more easily understand how He who had once hidden 
"these things," and promised a revelation of them through Christ, was the same 
God as He who had now revealed them unto babes. Else, if it was Marcion's god 
who revealed the things which had been formerly hidden by the Creator, it 
follows that he did the Creator's work by setting forth His deeds. But he did 
it, say you, for His destruction, that he might refute them. Therefore he ought 
to have refuted them to those from whom the Creator had hidden them, even the 
wise and prudent. For if he had a kind intention in what he did, the gift of 
knowledge was due to those from whom the Creator had detained it, instead of the 
babes, to whom the Creator had grudged no gift. But after all, it is, I presume, 
the edifica 
tion rather than the demolition of the law and the prophets which we have 
thus far found effected in Christ. "All things," He says, "are delivered unto me 
of my Father." you may believe Him, if He is the Christ of the Creator to whom 
all things belong; because the Creator has not delivered to a Son who is less 
than Himself all things, which He created by Him, that is to say, by His Word. 
If, on the contrary, he is the notorious stranger, what are the" all things" 
which have been delivered to him by the Father? Are they the Creator's? Then the 
things which the Father delivered to the Son are good. and the Creator is 
therefore good, since all His "things" are good; whereas he is no longer good 
who has invaded another's good (domains) to deliver it to his son, thus teaching 
robbery of another's goods. Surely he must be a most mendacious being, who had 
no other means of enriching his son than by helping himself to another's 
property! Or else, if nothing of the Creator's has been delivered to him by the 
Father, by what right does he claim for himself (authority over) man? Or again, 
if man has been delivered to him, and man alone, then man is not "all things." 
But Scripture clearly says that a transfer of all things has been made to the 
Son. If, however, you should interpret this "all" of the whole human race, that 
is, all nations, then the delivery of even these to the Son is within the 
purpose of the Creator: "I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and 
the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession." If, indeed, he has some 
things of his own, the whole of which he might give to his son, along with the 
man of the Creator, then show some one thing of them all, as a sample, that I 
may believe; lest I should have as much reason not to believe that all things 
belong to him, of whom I see nothing, as I have ground for believing that even 
the things which I see not are His, to whom belongs the universe, which I see. 
But "no man knoweth who the Father is, but the Son; and who the Son is, but the 
Father, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him." And so it was an unknown god 
that Christ preached! And other heretics, too, prop themselves up by this 
passage; alleging in opposition to it that the Creator was known to all, both to 
lsrael by familiar intercourse, and to the Gentiles by nature. Well, how is it 
He Himself testifies that He was not known to lsrael? "But Israel cloth not know 
me, and my people doth not consider me;" nor to the Gentiles: "For, behold," 
says He, "of the nations I have no man." Therefore He reckoned them "as the drop 
of a bucket," while "Sion He left as a look-out in a vineyard." See, then, 
whether there be not here a confirmation of the prophet's word, when he rebukes 
that ignorance of man toward God which continued to the days of the Son of man. 
For it was on this account that he inserted the clause that the Father is known 
by him to whom the Son has revealed Him, because it was even He who was 
announced as set by the Father to be a light to the Gentiles, who of course 
required to be enlightened concerning God, as well as to Israel, even by 
imparting to it a fuller knowledge of God. Arguments, therefore, will be of no 
use for belief in the rival god which may be suitable for the Creator, because 
it is only such as are unfit for the Creator which will be able to advance 
belief in His rival. If you look also into the next words, "Blessed are the eyes 
which see the things which ye see, for I tell you that prophets have not seen 
the things which ye see," you will find that they follow from the sense above, 
that no man indeed had come to the knowledge of God as he ought to have done, 
since even the prophets had not seen the things which were being seen under 
Christ. Now if He had not been my Christ, He would not have made any mention of 
the prophets in this passage. For what was there to wonder at, if they had not 
seen the things of a god who had been unknown to them, and was only revealed a 
long time after them? What blessedness, however, could theirs have been, who 
were then seeing what others were naturally unable to see, since it was of 
things which they had never predicted that they had not obtained the sight; if 
it were not because they might justly have seen the things pertaining to their 
God, which they had even predicted, but which they at the same time had not 
seen? This, however, will be the blessedness of others, even of such as were 
seeing the things which 
others had only foretold. We shall by and by show, nay, we have already 
shown, that in Christ those things were seen which had been foretold, but yet 
had been hidden from the very prophets who foretold them, in order that they 
might be hidden also from the wise and the prudent. In the true Gospel, a 
certain doctor of the law comes to the Lord and asks, "What shall I do to 
inherit life?" In the heretical gospel life only is mentioned, without the 
attribute eternal; so that the lawyer seems to have consulted Christ simply 
about the life which the Creator in the law promises to prolong, and the Lord to 
have therefore answered him according to the law, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy 
God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength," since 
the question was concerning the conditions of mere life. But the lawyer of 
course knew very well in what way the life which the law meant was to be 
obtained, so that his question could have had no relation to the life whose 
rules he was himself in the habit of teaching. But seeing that even the dead 
were now raised by Christ, and being himself excited to the hope of an eternal 
life by these examples of a restored one, he would lose no more time in merely 
looking on (at the wonderful things which had made him) so high in hope. He 
therefore consulted him about the attainment of eternal life. Accordingly, the 
Lord, being Himself the same, and introducing no new precept other than that 
which relates above all others to (man's) entire salvation, even including the 
present and the future life, places before him the very essence of the law--that 
he should in every possible way love the Lord his God. If, indeed, it were only 
about a lengthened life, such as is at the Creator's disposal, that he inquired 
and Christ answered, and not about the eternal life, which is at the disposal of 
Marcion's god, how is he to obtain the eternal one? Surely not in the same 
manner as the prolonged life. For in proportion to the difference of the reward 
must be supposed to be also the diversity of the services. Therefore your 
disciple, Marcion, will not obtain his eternal life in consequence of loving 
your God, in the same way as the man who loves the Creator will secure the 
lengthened life. But how happens it that, if He is to be loved who promises the 
prolonged I life, He is not much more to be loved who offers the eternal life? 
Therefore both one and the other life will be at the disposal of one and the 
same Lord; because one and the same discipline is to be followed for one and the 
other life. What the Creator teaches to be loved, that must He necessarily 
maintain also by Christ, for that rule holds good here, which prescribes that 
greater things ought to be believed of Him who has first lesser proofs to show, 
than of him for whom no preceding smaller presumptions have secured a claim to 
be believed in things of higher import. It matters not then, whether the word 
eternal has been interpolated by us. It is enough for me, that the Christ who 
invited men to the eternal--not the lengthened--life, when consuited about the 
temporal life which he was destroying, did not choose to exhort the man rather 
to that eternal life which he was introducing. Pray, what would the Creator's 
Christ have done. if He who had made man for loving the Creator did not belong 
to the Creator? I suppose He would have said that the Creator was not to be 
loved! 
CHAP.XXVI.--FROM ST. LUKE'S ELEVENTH CHAPTER OTHER EVIDENCE THAT 
CHRIST
COMES FROM THE CREATOR. THE LORD'S PRAYER AND OTHER WORDS OF CHRIST. THE 
DUMB SPIRIT AND CHRIST'S DISCOURSE ON OCCASION OF THE EXPULSION. THE 
EXCLAMATION OF THE WOMAN IN THE CROWD.
When in a certain place he had been praying to that Father above, looking up 
with insolent and audacious eyes to the heaven of the Creator, by whom in His 
rough and cruel nature he might have been crushed with hail and lightning--just 
as it was by Him contrived that he was (afterwards) attached to a cross at 
Jerusalem--one of his disciples came to him and said, "Master, teach us to pray, 
as John also taught his disciples." This he said, forsooth, because he thought 
that different prayers were required for different gods! Now, he who had 
advanced such a conjecture as this should first show that another god had been 
proclaimed by Christ. For nobody would have wanted to know how to pray, before 
he had learned whom he was to pray to. If, however, he had already learned this, 
prove it. If you find nowhere any proof, let me tell you that it was to the 
Creator that he asked 
for instruction in prayer, to whom John's disciples also used to pray. But, 
inasmuch as John had introduced some new order of prayer, this disciple had not 
improperly presumed to think that he ought also to ask of Christ whether they 
too must not (according to some special rule of their Master) pray, not indeed 
to another god, but in another manner. Christ accordingly would not have taught 
His disciple prayer before He had given him the knowledge of God Himself. 
Therefore what He actually taught was prayer to Him whom the disciple had 
already known. In short, you may discover in the import of the prayer what God 
is addressed therein. To whom can I say, "Father?" To him who had nothing to do 
with making me, from whom I do not derive my origin? Or to Him, who, by making 
and fashioning me, became my parent? Of whom can I ask for His Holy Spirit? Of 
him who gives not even the mundane spirit; or of Him "who maketh His angels 
spirits," and whose Spirit it was which in the beginning hovered upon the 
waters. Whose kingdom shall I wish to come--his, of whom I never heard as the 
king of glory; or His, in whose hand are even the hearts of kings? Who shall 
give me my daily bread? Shall it be he who produces for me not a grain of 
miIlet-seed; or He who even from heaven gave to His people day by day the bread 
of angels? Who shall forgive me my trespasses? He who, by refusing to judge 
them, does not retain them; or He who, unless He forgives them, will retain 
them, even to His judgment? Who shall suffer us not to be led into temptation? 
He before whom the tempter will never be able to tremble; or He who from the 
beginning has beforehand condemned the angel tempter? If any one, with such a 
form, invokes another god and not the Creator, he does not pray; he only 
blasphemes. In like manner, from whom must I ask that I may receive? Of whom 
seek, that I may find? To whom knock, that it may be opened to me? Who has to 
give to him that asks, but He to whom all things belong, and whose am I also 
that am the asker? What, however, have I lost before that other god, that I 
should seek of him and find it. If it be wisdom and prudence, it is the Creator 
who has hidden them. Shall I resort to him, then, in quest of them? If it be 
health and life, they are at the disposal of the Creator. Nor must anything be 
sought and found anywhere else than there, where it is kept in secret that it 
may come to light. So, again, at no other door will I knock than at that out of 
which my privilege has reached me. In fine, if to receive, and to find, and to 
be admitted, is the fruit of labour and earnestness to him who has asked, and 
sought, and knocked, understand that these duties have been enjoined, and 
results promised, by the Creator. As for that most excellent god of yours, 
coming as he professes gratuitously to help man, who was not his (creature), he 
could not have imposed upon him any labour, or (endowed him with) any 
earnestness. For he would by this time cease to be the most excellent god, were 
he not spontaneously to give to every one who does not ask, and permit every one 
who seeks not to find, and open to every one who does not knock. The Creator, on 
the contrary, was able to proclaim these duties and rewards by Christ, in order 
that man, who by sinning had offended his God, might toil on (in his probation), 
and by his perseverance in asking might receive, and in seeking might find, and 
in knocking might enter. Accordingly, the preceding similitude represents the 
man who went at night and begged for the loaves, in the light of a friend and 
not a stranger, and makes him knock at a friend's house and not at a stranger's. 
But even if he has offended, man is more of a friend with the Creator than with 
the god of Marcion. At His door, therefore, does he knock to whom he had the 
right of access; whose gate he had found; whom he knew to possess bread; in bed 
now with His children, whom He had willed to be born. Even though the knocking 
is late in the day, it is yet the Creator's time. To Him belongs the latest hour 
who owns an entire age and the end thereof. As for the new god, however, no one 
could have knocked at his door late, for he has hardly yet seen the light of 
morning. It is the Creator, who once shut the door to the Gentiles, which was 
then knocked at by the Jews, that both rises and gives, if not now to man as a 
friend, yet not as a stranger, but, as He says, "because 
of his importunity." Impoprtant, however, the recent god could not have 
permitted any one to be in the short time (since his appearance). Him, 
therefore, whom you call the Creator recognise also as "Father." It is even He 
who knows what His children require. For when they asked for bread, He gave them 
manna from heaven; and when they wanted flesh, He sent them abundance of 
quails--not a serpent for a fish, nor for an egg a scorpion. It will, however, 
appertain to Him not to give evil instead of good, who has both one and the 
other in His power. Marcion's god, on the contrary, not having a scorpion, was 
unable to refuse to give what he did not possess; only He (could do so), who, 
having a scorpion, yet gives it not. In like manner, it is He who will give the 
Holy Spirit, at whose command is also the unholy spirit. When He cast out the 
"demon which was dumb" (and by a cure of this sort verified Isaiah), and having 
been charged with casting out demons by Beelzebub, He said, "If I by Beelzebub 
cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out?" By such a question what 
does He otherwise mean, than that He ejects the spirits by the same power by 
which their sons also did--that is, by the power of the Creator? For if you 
suppose the meaning to be, "If I by Beelzebub, etc., by whom your sons?"--as if 
He would reproach them with having the power of Beelzebub,--you are met at once 
by the preceding sentence, that "Satan cannot be divided against himself." So 
that it was not by Beelzebub that even they were casting out demons, but (as we 
have said) by the power of the Creator; and that He might make this understood, 
He adds: "But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, is not the kingdom of 
God come near unto you?" For the magicians who stood before Pharaoh and resisted 
Moses called the power of the Creator" the finger of God." It was the finger of 
God, because it was a sign that even a thing of weakness was yet abundant in 
strength. This Christ also showed, when, recalling to notice (and not 
obliterating) those ancient wonders which were really His own, He said that the 
power of God must be understood to be the finger of none other God than Him, 
under whom it had received this appellation. His kingdom, therefore, was come 
near to them, whose power was called His "finger." Well, therefore, did He 
connect" with the parable of "the strong man armed," whom "a stronger man still 
overcame, the prince of the demons, whom He had already called Beelzebub and 
Satan; signifying that it was he who was overcome by the finger of God, and not 
that the Creator had been subdued by another god. 
Besides, how could His kingdom be still standing, with its boundaries, and 
laws, and functions, whom, even if the whole world were left entire to Him, 
Marcion's god could possibly seem to have overcome as "the stronger than He," if 
it were not in consequence of His law that even Marcionites were constantly 
dying, by returning in their dissolution to the ground, and were so often 
admonished by even a scorpion, that the Creator had by no means been overcome? 
"A (certain) mother of the company exclaims, 'Blessed is the womb that bare 
Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked;' but the Lord said, 'Yea, rather, 
blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.'" Now He had in 
precisely similar terms rejected His mother or His brethren, whilst preferring 
those who heard and obeyed God. His mother, however, was not here present with 
Him. On that former occasion, therefore, He had not denied that He was her son 
by birth. On hearing this (salutation) the second time, He the second time 
transferred, as He had done before, the "blessedness" to His disciples from the 
womb and the paps of His mother, from whom, however, unless He had in her (a 
real mother) He could not have transferred it. 
CHAP. XXVII.--CHRIST'S REPREHENSION OF THE PHARISEES SEEKING A SIGN. HIS 
CENSURE OF THEIR LOVE OF OUTWARD SHOW RATHER THAN INWARD HOLINESS.SCRIPTURE 
ABOUNDS WITH ADMONITIONS OF A SIMILAR PURPORT, PROOFS OF HIS MISSION FROM 
THE CREATOR.
I prefer elsewhere refuting the faults which the Marcionites find in the 
Creator. It is here enough that they are also found in Christ. Behold how 
unequal, inconsistent, and capricious he is! Teaching one thing 
and doing another, he enjoins "giving to every one that seeks;" and yet he 
himself refuses to give to those "who seek a sign." For a vast age he hides his 
own light from men, and yet says that a candle must not be hidden, but affirms 
that it ought to be set upon a candlestick, that it may give light to all. He 
forbids cursing again, and cursing much more of course; and yet he heaps his woe 
upon the Pharisees and doctors of the law. Who so closely resembles my God as: 
His own Christ? We have often already laid it down for certain, that He could 
not have been branded as the destroyer of the law if He had promulged another 
god. Therefore even the Pharisee, who invited Him to dinner in the passage 
before us, expressed some surprise in His presence that He had not washed before 
He sat down to meat, in accordance with the law, since it was the God of the law 
that He was proclaiming. Jesus also interpreted the law to him when He told him 
that they "made clean the outside of the cup and the platter, whereas their 
inward part was full of ravening and wickedness." This He said, to signify that 
by the cleansing of vessels was to be understood before God the purification of 
men, inasmuch as it was about a man, and not about an unwashed vessel, that even 
this Pharisee had been treating in His presence. He therefore said: "You wash 
the outside of the cup," that is, the flesh, "but you do not cleanse your inside 
part," 
that is, the soul; adding: "Did not He that made the outside," that is, the 
flesh, "also make the inward part," that is to say, the soul?--by which 
assertion He expressly declared that to the same God belongs the cleansing of a 
man's external and internal nature, both alike being in the power of Him who 
prefers mercy not only to man's washing, but even to sacrifice. For He subjoins 
the command: "Give what ye possess as alms, and alI things shall be clean unto 
you." Even if another god could have enjoined mercy, he could not have done so 
previous to his becoming known. Furthermore, it is in this passage evident that 
they were not reproved concerning their God, but concerning a point of His 
instruction to them, when He prescribed to them figuratively the cleansing of 
their vessels, but really the works of merciful dispositions. In like manner, He 
upbraids them for tithing paltry herbs, but at the same time "passing over 
hospitality and the love of God. The vocation and the love of what God, but Him 
by whose law of tithes they used to offer their rue and mint? For the whole 
point of the rebuke lay in this, that they cared about small matters in His 
service of course, to whom they failed to exhibit their weightier duties when He 
commanded them: "Thou shalt love with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, 
and with all thy strength, the Lord thy God, who hath called thee out of Egypt." 
Besides, time enough had not yet passed to admit of Christ's requiring so 
premature--nay, as yet so distasteful--a love towards a new and recent, not to 
say a hardly i yet developed, deity. When, again, He upbraids those who caught 
at the uppermost places and the honour of public salutations, He only follows 
out the Creator's course, who calls ambitious persons of this character "rulers 
of Sodom" who forbids us "to put confidence even in princes," and pronounces him 
to be altogether wretched who places his confidence in man. But whoever aims at 
high position, because he would glory in the officious attentions of other 
people, (in every such case,) inasmuch as He forbade such attentions (in the 
shape) of placing hope and confidence in man, He at the same time censured all 
who were ambitious of high positions. He also inveighs against the doctors of 
the law themselves, because they were "lading men with burdens grievous to be 
borne, which they did not venture to touch with even a finger of their own;" but 
not as if He made a mock of the burdens of the law with any feeling of 
detestation towards it. For how could He have felt aversion to the law, who used 
with so much earnestness to upbraid them for passing over its weightier matters, 
alms--giving, hospitality, and the love of God? Nor, indeed, was it only these 
great things (which He recognized), but even the tithes of rue and the cleansing 
of cups. But, 
in truth, He would rather have deemed them excusable for being unable to 
carry burdens which could not be borne. What, then, are the burdens which He 
censures? None but those which they were accumulating of their own accord, when 
they taught for commandments the doctrines of men; for the sake of private 
advantage joining house to house, so as to deprive their neighbour of his own; 
cajoling the people, loving gifts, pursuing rewards, robbing the poor of the 
rights of judgment, that they might have the widow for a prey and the fatherless 
for a spoil. Of these Isaiah also says, "Woe unto them that are strong in 
Jerusalem!" and again, "They that demand you shall rule over you." And who did 
this more than the lawyers? Now, if these offended Christ, it was as belonging 
to Him that they offended Him. He would have aimed no blow at the teachers of an 
alien law. But why is a "woe" pronounced against them for "building the 
sepulchres of the prophets whom their fathers had killed?" They rather deserved 
praise, because by such an act of piety they seemed to show that they did not 
allow the deeds of their fathers. Was it not because (Christ) was jealous of 
such a disposition as the Marcionites denounce, visiting the sins of the fathers 
upon the children unto the fourth generation? What "key," indeed, was it which 
these lawyers had, but the interpretation of the law? Into the perception of 
this they neither entered themselves, even because they did not believe (for 
"unless ye believe, ye shall not understand"); nor did they permit others to 
enter, because they preferred to teach them for commandments even the doctrines 
of men. When, therefore, He reproached those who did not themselves enter in, 
and also shut the door against others, must He be regarded as a disparager of 
the law, or as a supporter of it? If a disparager, those who were hindering the 
law ought to have been pleased; if a supporter, He is no longer an enemy of the 
law. But all these imprecations He uttered in order to tarnish the Creator as a 
cruel Being, against whom such as offended were destined to have a "woe." And 
who would not rather have feared to provoke a cruel Being, by withdrawing 
allegiance from Him? Therefore the more He represented the Creator to be an 
object of fear, the more earnestly would He teach that He ought to be served. 
Thus would it behove the Creator's Christ to act. 
CHAP. XXVIII.--EXAMPLES FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT, BALAAM, MOSES, AND 
HEZEKIAH, TO SHOW HOW COMPLETELY THE INSTRUCTION AND CONDUCT OF CHRIST ARE 
IN KEEPING WITH THE WILL AND PURPOSE OF THE CREATOR.
Justly, therefore, was the hypocrisy of the Pharisees displeasing to Him, 
loving God as they did with their lips, but not with their heart. "Beware," He 
says to the disciples, "of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy," not 
the proclamation of the Creator. The Son hates those who refused obedience to 
the Father; nor does He wish His disciples to show such a disposition towards 
Him--not (let it be observed) towards another god, against whom such hypocrisy 
indeed might have been admissible, as that which He wished to guard His 
disciples against. It is the example of the Pharisees which He forbids. It was 
in respect of Him against whom the Pharisees were sinning that (Christ) now 
forbade His disciples to offend. Since, then, He had censured their hypocrisy, 
which covered the secrets of the heart, and obscured with superficial offices 
the mysteries of unbelief, because (while holding the key of knowledge) it would 
neither enter in itself, nor permit others to enter in, He therefore adds, 
"There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid, which shall 
not be known," in order that no one should suppose that He was attempting the 
revelation and the recognition of an hitherto unknown and hidden god. When He 
remarks also on their murmurs and taunts, in saying of Him, "This man casteth 
out devils only through Beelzebub," He means that all these imputations would 
come forth to the light of day, and be in the mouths of men in consequence of 
the promulgation of the Gospel. He then turns to His disciples with these words, 
"I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them which can only kill the body, 
and after that have no more power over you." They will, however, find Isaiah had 
already said, "See how the just man is taken away, and no man layeth it to 
heart." "But I will show you whom ye shall fear: fear Him who, after 
He hath killed, hath power to cast into hell" (meaning, of course, the 
Creator); "yea, I say unto you, fear Him." Now, it would here be enough for my 
purpose that He forbids offence being given to Him whom He orders to be feared; 
and that He orders Him to be respected whom He forbids to be offended; and that 
He who gives these commands belongs to that very God for whom He procures this 
fear, this absence of offence, and this respect. But this conclusion I can draw 
also from the following words: "For I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me 
before men, him will I also confess before God." Now they who shall confess 
Christ will have to be slain before men, but they will have nothing more to 
suffer after they have been put to death by them. These therefore will be they 
whom He forewarns above not to be afraid of being only killed; and this 
forewarning He offers, in order that He might subjoin a clause on the necessity 
of confessing Him: "Every one that denieth me before men shall be denied before 
God"--by Him, of course, who would have confessed him, if he had only confessed 
God. Now, He who will confess the confessor is the very same God who will also 
deny the denier of Himself. Again, if it is the confessor who will have nothing 
to fear after his violent death, it is the denier to whom everything will become 
fearful after his natural death. Since, therefore, that which will have to be 
feared after death, even the punishment of hell, belongs to the Creator, the 
denier, too, belongs to the Creator. As with the denier, however, so with the 
confessor: if he should deny God, he will plainly have to suffer from God, 
although from men he had nothing more to suffer after they had put him to death. 
And so Christ is the Creator's, because He shows that all those who deny Him 
ought to fear the Creator's hell. After deterring disciples from denial of 
Himself, He adds an admonition to fear blasphemy: "Whosoever shall speak against 
the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the 
Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him." Now, if both the remission and the 
retention of sin savour of a judicial God, the Holy Ghost, who is not to be 
blasphemed, will belong to Him, who will not forgive the, blasphemy; just as He 
who, in the preceding passage, was not to be denied, belonged to, Him who would, 
after He had killed, also cast into hell. Now, since it is Christ who averts 
blasphemy from the Creator, I am at a loss to know in what manner His adversary. 
could have come. Else, if by these sayings He throws a black cloud of censure 
over the severity of Him who will not forgive blasphemy and will kill even to 
hell, it follows that the very spirit of that rival god may be blasphemed with 
impunity, and his Christ denied; and that there is no difference, in fact, 
between worshipping and despising him; but that, as there is no punishment for 
the contempt, so there is no reward for the worship, which men need expect. When 
"brought before magistrates," and examined, He forbids them "to take thought how 
they shall answer;" "for," says He, "the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that very 
hour what ye ought to say." If such an injunction as this comes from the 
Creator, the precept will only be His by whom an example was previously given. 
The prophet Balaam, in Numbers, when sent forth by king Balak to curse lsrael, 
with whom he was commencing war, was at the same moment filled with the Spirit. 
Instead of the curse which he was come to pronounce, he uttered the blessing 
which the Spirit at that very hour inspired him with; having previously declared 
to the king's messengers, and then to the king himself, that he could only speak 
forth that which God should put into his mouth. The novel doctrines of the new 
Christ are such as the Creator's servants initiated long before! But see how 
clear a difference there is between the example of Moses and of Christ. Moses 
voluntarily interferes with brothers who were quarrelling, and chides the 
offender: "Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?" He is, however, rejected by him: 
"Who made thee a prince or a judge over us?" Christ, on the contrary, when 
requested by a certain man to compose a strife between him and his brother about 
dividing an inheritance, refused His assistance, although in so honest a cause. 
Well, then, my Moses is better than your Christ, aiming as he did at the peace 
of brethren, and obviating their wrong. But of course the case must be different 
with Christ, for he is the Christ of the simply good and non-judicial god. 
"Who," says he, "made me a judge over you?" 
No other word of excuse was he able to find, 
without using that with which the wicked, man and impious brother had 
rejected the defender of probity and piety! In short, he approved of the excuse, 
although a bad one, by his use of it; and of the act, although a bad one, by his 
refusal to make peace between brothers. Or rather, would He not show His 
resentment at the rejection of Moses with such a word? And therefore did He not 
wish in a similar case of contentious brothers, to confound them with the 
recollection of so harsh a word? Clearly so. For He had Himself been present in 
Moses, who heard such a rejection--even He, the Spirit of the Creator. I think 
that we have already, in another passage, sufficiently shown that the glory of 
riches is condemned by our God, "who putteth down the mighty from their throne, 
and exalts the poor from the dunghill." From Him, therefore, will proceed the 
parable of the rich man, who flattered himself about the increase of his fields, 
and to Whom God said: "Thou fool, this night shall they require thy soul of 
thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?" It was just in 
the like manner that the king Hezekiah heard from Isaiah the sad doom of his 
kingdom, when he gloried, before the envoys of Babylon, in his treasures and the 
deposits of his precious things. 
CHAP. XXIX.--PARALLELS FROM THE PROPHETS TO ILLUSTRATE CHRIST'S TEACHING 
IN THE REST OF THIS CHAPTER OF ST. LUKE. THE STERNER ATTRIBUTES OF CHRIST, IN 
HIS JUDICIAL CAPACITY, SHOW HIM TO HAVE COME FROM THE CREATOR. INCIDENTAL 
REBUKES OF MARCION'S DOCTRINE OF CELIBACY, AND OF HIS ALTERING OF THE 
TEXT OF THE GOSPEL.
Who would be unwilling that we should distress ourselves about sustenance for 
our life, or clothing for our body, but He who has provided these things already 
for man; and who, therefore, while distributing them to us, prohibits all 
anxiety respecting them as an outrage against his liberality?--who has adapted 
the nature of "life" itself to a condition "better than meat," and has fashioned 
the material of "the body," so as to make it "more than raiment;" whose "ravens, 
too, neither sow nor reap, nor gather into storehouses, and are yet fed" by 
Himself; whose "lilies and grass also toil not, nor spin, and yet are clothed" 
by Him; whose "Solomon, moreover, was transcendent in glory, and yet was not 
arrayed like" the humble flower. Besides, nothing can be more abrupt than that 
one God should be distributing His bounty, while the other should bid us take no 
thought about (so kindly a) distribution--and that, too, with the intention of 
derogating (from his liberality). Whether, indeed, it is as depreciating the 
Creator that he does not wish such trifles to be thought of, concerning which 
neither the crows nor the lilies labour, because, forsooth, they come 
spontaneously to hand by reason of their very worthlessness, will appear a 
little further on. Meanwhile, how is it that He chides them as being "of little 
faith?" What faith? Does He mean that faith which they were as yet unable to 
manifest perfectly in a god who has hardly yet revealed, and whom they were in 
process of learning as well as they could; or that faith which they for this 
express reason owed to the Creator, because they believed that He was of His own 
will supplying these wants of the human race, and therefore took no thought 
about them? Now, when He adds, "For all these things do the nations of the world 
seek after," even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all 
things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He 
therefore upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He 
remarked that the Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, 
"But your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things," I would first ask, 
what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own 
Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who knows what His children have need 
of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know that food and raiment 
are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such pro vision for him? For if 
he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows 
what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the 
failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these 
things are necessary to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing 
that is evil is necessary. So that he will not be any longer 
a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may 
here complete the answer which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another 
god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that 
Marcion's Christ himself promises them? Is he liberal with another's property? 
"Seek ye," says he, "the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added 
unto you"--by himself, of course. But if by himself, what sort of being is he, 
who shall bestow the things of another? If by the Creator, whose all things are, 
then who is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are 
"additions" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank; and the 
second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and 
raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, 
the full reality of its parables, the perfect equalization of its similitudes; 
for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of 
relation in every point. We are servants because we have a Lord in our God. We 
ought "to have our loins girded:" in other words, we are to be free from the 
embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied life; "to have our lights 
burning," that is, our minds kindled by faith, and resplendent with the works of 
truth. And thus "to wait for our Lord," that is, Christ. Whence "returning?" If 
"from the wedding," He is the Christ of the Creator, for the wedding is His. If 
He is not the Creator's, not even Marcion himself would have gone to the 
wedding, although invited, for in his god he discovers one who hates the nuptial 
bed. The parable would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He 
were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next parable also he 
makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that 
"thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not 
have suffered his house to be broken through." How can the Creator wear in any 
way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind? No one pilfers or 
plunders his own property, but he rather acts the part of one who swoops down on 
the things of another, and alienates man from his Lord. Again, when He indicates 
to us that the devil is "the thief," whose hour at the very beginning of the 
world, if man had known, he would never have been broken in upon by him, He 
warns us "to be ready," for this reason, because "we know not the hour when the 
Son of man shall come"--not as if He were Himself the thief, but rather as being 
the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no precaution against 
the thief. Since, then, He is the Son of man, I hold Him to be the Judge, and in 
the Judge I claim the Creator. If then in this passage he displays the Creator's 
Christ under the title "Son of man," that he may give us some presage of the 
thief, of the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled 
above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our 
principle also unimpaired--that in as far as He insists on the Creator as an 
object of fear, in so far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's 
work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the parable "unto them, 
or even to all," He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the 
churches, the similitude of stewards. That steward who should treat his 
fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler 
over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and 
have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day 
when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware--even that Son of 
man, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this 
passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His 
character, or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms 
his judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt 
is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,--as if it were an 
act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a 
portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before 
the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not 
imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? 
Will it not be the for feiture of salvation, since their separation will be from 
those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the un 
believers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful 
ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for 
the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the 
believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the 
unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now 
here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. 
Whom else than the God of retribution can I understand by Him who shall "beat 
His servants with stripes," either "few or many," and shall exact from them what 
He had committed to them? Whom is it suitable for me to obey, but Him who 
remunerates? Your Christ proclaims, "I am come to send fire on the earth." That 
most lenient being, the lord who has no hell, not long before had restrained his 
disciples from demanding fire on the churlish village. Whereas He burnt up Sodom 
and Gomorrah with a tempest of fire. Of Him the psalmist sang, "A fire shall go 
out before Him, and burn up His enemies round about." By Hoses He uttered the 
threat, "I will send a fire upon the cities of Judah;" and by Isaiah, "A fire 
has been kindled in mine anger." He cannot lie. If it is not He who uttered His 
voice out of even the burning bush, it can be of no importance what fire you 
insist upon being understood. Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the 
very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is 
mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him 
who owns the reality thereof. But He will Himself best explain the quality of 
that fire which He mentioned, when He goes on to say, "Suppose ye that I am come 
to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division." It is written "a 
sword," but Marcion makes an emendation of the word, just as if a division were 
not the work of the sword. He, therefore, who refused to give peace, intended 
also the fire of destruction. As is the combat, so is the burning. As is the 
sword, so is the flame. Neither is suitable for its lord. He says at last, "The 
father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the 
mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the 
mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against the 
mother-in-law." Since this battle among the relatives was sung by the prophet's 
trumpet in the very words, I fear that Micah must have predicted it to Marcion's 
Christ! On this account He pronounced them "hypocrites," because they could 
"discern the face of the sky and the earth, but could not distinguish this 
time," when of course He ought to have been recognised, fulfilling (as he was) 
all things which had been predicted concerning them, and teaching them so. But 
then who could know the times of him of whom he had no evidence to prove his 
existence? Justly also does He upbraid them for "not even of themselves judging 
what is right." Of old does He command by Zechariah, "Execute the judgment of 
truth and peace;" by Jeremiah, "Execute judgment and righteousness;" by Isaiah, 
"Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow," charging it as a fault upon the 
vine of Sorech, that when "He looked for righteousness therefrom, there was only 
a cry" (of oppression). The same God who had taught them to act as He commanded 
them, was now requiring that they should act of their own accord. He who had 
sown the precept, was now pressing to an abundant harvest from it. But how 
absurd, that he should now be commanding them to judge righteously, who was 
destroying God the righteous Judge! For the Judge, who commits to prison, and 
allows no release Out of it without the payment of "the very last mite," they 
treat of in the person of the Creator, with the view of disparaging Him. Which 
cavil, however, I deem it necessary to meet with the same answer. For as often 
as the Creator's severity is paraded before us, so often is Christ (shown to be) 
His, to whom He urges submission by the motive of fear. 
CHAP. XXX.--PARABLES OF THE MUSTARD-SEED, AND OF THE LEAVEN. 
TRANSITION TO THE SOLEMN EXCLUSION WHICH WILL ENSUE WHEN THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE 
HAS SHUT THE DOOR. THIS JUDICIAL EXCLUSION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY CHRIST, WHO 
IS SHOWN THEREBY TO POSSESS THE ATTRIBUTE OF THE CREATOR.
When the question was again raised concerning a cure performed on the 
Sabbath-day, how did He discuss it: "Doth not each of you on the Sabbath loose 
his ass or his ox from the stall, and lead him away to watering?" When, 
therefore, He did a work according to the condition prescribed by the law, He 
affirmed, instead of breaking, the law, which commanded that no work should be 
done, except what might be done for any living being; and if for any one, then 
how much more for a human life? In the case of the parables, it is allowed that 
I everywhere require a congruity. "The kingdom of God," says He, "is like a 
grain of mustard-seed which a man took and cast into his garden." Who must be 
understood as meant by the man? Surely Christ, because (although Marcion's) he 
was called "the Son of man." He received from the Father the seed of the 
kingdom, that is, the word of the gospel, and sowed it in his garden--in the 
world, of course--in man at the present day, for instance. Now, whereas it is 
said, "in his garden," but neither the world nor man is his property, but the 
Creator's, therefore He who sowed seed in His own ground is shown to be the 
Creator. Else, if, to evade this snare, they should choose to transfer the 
person of the man from Christ to any person who receives the seed of the kingdom 
and sows it in the garden of his own heart, not even this meaning would suit any 
other than the Creator. For how happens it, if the kingdom belong to the most 
lenient god, that it is closely followed up by a fervent judgment, the severity 
of which brings weeping? 
With regard, indeed, to the following similitude, I have my fears lest it 
should somehow presage the kingdom of the rival god! For He compared it, not to 
the unleavened bread which the Creator is more familiar with, but to leaven. Now 
this is a capital conjecture for men who are begging for arguments. I must, 
however, on my side, dispel one fond conceit by another," and contend with even 
leaven is suitable for the kingdom of the Creator, because after it comes the 
oven, or, if you please, the furnace of hell. How often has He already displayed 
Himself as a Judge, and in the Judge the Creator? How often, indeed, has He 
repelled, and in the repulse condemned? In the present passage, for instance, He 
says, "When once the master of the house is risen up;" but in what sense except 
that in which Isaiah said, "When He ariseth to shake terribly the earth?" "And 
hath shut to the door," thereby shutting out the wicked, of course; and when 
these knock, He will answer, "I know you not whence ye are;" and when they 
recount how "they have eaten and drunk in His presence," He will further say to 
them, "Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; there shall be weeping and 
gnashing of teeth." But where? Outside, no doubt, when they shall have been 
excluded with the door shut on them by Him. There will therefore be punishment 
inflicted by Him who excludes for punishment, when they shall behold the 
righteous entering the kingdom of God, but themselves detained without. By whom 
detained outside? If by the Creator, who shall be within receiving the righteous 
into the kingdom? The good God. What, therefore, is the Creator about, that He 
should detain outside for punishment those whom His adversary shut out, when He 
ought rather to have kindly received them, if they must come into His hands, for 
the greater irritation of His rival? But when about to exclude the wicked, he 
must, of course, either be aware that the Creator would detain them for 
punishment, or not be aware. Consequently either the wicked will be detained by 
the Creator against the will of the excluder, in which case he will be inferior 
to the Creator, submitting to Him unwillingly; or else, if the process is 
carried out with his will, then he himself has judicially determined its 
execution; and then he who is the very originator of the Creator's infamy, will 
not prove to be one whit better than the Creator. Now, if these ideas be 
incompatible with reason--of one being supposed to punish, and the other to 
liberate--then to one only power will appertain both the judgment and the 
kingdom and while they both belong to one, He who executeth judgment can be none 
else than the Christ of the Creator. 
CHAP. XXXI.--CHRIST'S ADVICE TO INVITE THE POOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ISAIAH. 
THE PARABLE OF THE GREAT SUPPER A PICTORIAL SKETCH OF THE CREATOR'S OWN
DISPENSATIONS OF MERCY AND GRACE. THE REJECTIONS OF THE INVITATION 
PARALLELED
BY QUOTATIONS FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT MARCION'S CHRIST COULD NOT FULFIL 
THE
CONDITIONS INDICATED IN THIS PARABLE THE ABSURDITY OF THE MARCIONITE
INTERPRETATION.
What kind of persons does He bid should be invited to a dinner or a supper? 
Precisely such as he had pointed out by Isaiah: "Deal thy bread to the hungry 
man; and the beggars--even such as have no home--bring in to thine house," 
because, no doubt, they are "unable to recompense" your act of humanity. Now, 
since Christ forbids the recompense to be expected now, but promises it "at the 
resurrection," this is the very plan of the Creator, who dislikes those who love 
gifts and follow after reward. Consider also to which deity is better suited the 
parable of him who issued invitations: "A certain man made a great supper, and 
bade many." The preparation for the supper is no doubt a figure of the abundant 
provision of eternal life. I first remark, that strangers, and persons 
unconnected by ties of relationship, are not usually invited to a supper; but 
that members of the household and family are more frequently the favoured 
guests. To the Creator, then, it belonged to give the invitation, to whom also 
appertained those who were to be invited --whether considered as men, through 
their descent from Adam, or as Jews, by reason of their fathers; not to him who 
possessed no claim to them either by nature or prerogative. My next remark is, 
if He issues the invitations who has prepared the supper, then, in this sense 
the supper is the Creator's, who sent to warn the guests. These had been indeed 
previously invited by the fathers, but were to be admonished by the prophets. It 
certainly is not the feast of him who never sent a messenger to warn--who never 
did a thing before towards issuing an invitation, but came down himself on a 
sudden--only then beginning to be known, when already giving his invitation; 
only then inviting, when already compelling to his banquet; appointing one and 
the same hour both for the supper and the invitation. But when invited, they 
excuse themselves? And fairly enough, if the invitation came from the other god, 
because it was so sudden; if, however, the excuse was not a fair one, then the 
invitation was not a sudden one. Now, if the invitation was not a sudden one, it 
must have been given by the Creator--even by Him of old time, whose call they 
had at last refused. They first refused it when they said to Aaron, "Make us 
gods, which shall go before us; and again, afterwards, when "they heard indeed 
with the ear, but did not understand" their calling of God. In a manner most 
germane I to this parable, He said by Jeremiah: "Obey my voice, and I will be 
your God, and ye shall be my people; and ye shall walk in all my ways, which I 
have commanded you." This is the invitation of God. "But," says He, "they 
hearkened not, nor inclined their ear." This is the refusal of the people. "They 
departed, and walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart." "I have 
bought a field--and I have bought some oxen--and I have married a wife." And 
still He urges them: "I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising 
early even before day-light." The Holy Spirit is here meant, the admonisher of 
the guests. "Yet my people hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but 
hardened their neck." This was reported to the Master of the family. Then He was 
moved (He did well to be moved; for, as Marcion denies emotion to his god, He 
must be therefore my God), and commanded them to invite out of "the streets and 
lanes of the city." Let us see whether this is not the same in purport as His 
words by Jeremiah: "Have I been a wilderness to the house of Israel, or a land 
left uncultivated?" That is to say: "Then have I none whom I may call to me; 
have I no place whence I may bring them?" "Since my people have said, We will 
come no more unto thee." Therefore He sent out to call others, but from the same 
city. My third remark is this, that although the place abounded with people, He 
yet commanded that they gather men from the highways and the hedges. In other 
words, we are now gathered out of the 
Gentile strangers; with that jealous resentment, no doubt, which He expressed 
in Deuteronomy: "I will hide my face from them, and I will show them what shall 
happen in the last days (how that others shall possess their place); for they 
are a froward generation, children in whom is no faith. They have moved me to 
jealousy by that which is no god, and they have provoked me to anger with. their 
idols; and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people: I 
will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation"--even with us, whose hope the 
Jews still entertain. But this hope the Lord says they should not realize; "Sion 
being left as a cottages in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers," 
since the nation rejected the latest invitation to Christ. (Now, I ask,) after 
going through all this course of the Creator's dispensation and prophecies, what 
there is in it which can possibly be assigned to him who has done all his work 
at one hasty stroke, and possesses neither the Creator's course nor His 
dispensation in harmony with the parable? Or, again in what will consist his 
first invitation, and what his admonition at the second stage? Some at first 
would surely decline; others afterwards must have accepted." But now he comes to 
invite both parties promiscuously out of the city, out of the hedges, contrary 
to the drift of the parable. It is impossible for him now to condemn as scorners 
of his invitation those whom he has never yet invited, and whom he is 
approaching with so much earnestness. If, however, he condemns them beforehand 
as about to reject his call, then beforehand he also predicts the election of 
the Gentiles in their stead. Certainly he means to come the second time for the 
very purpose of preaching to the heathen. But even if he does mean to come 
again, I imagine it will not be with the intention of any longer inviting 
guests, but of giving to them their places. Meanwhile, you who interpret the 
call to this supper as an invitation to a heavenly banquet of spiritual satiety 
and pleasure, must remember that the earthly promises also of wine and oil and 
corn, and even of the city, are equally employed by the Creator as figures of 
spiritual things. 
CHAP. XXXII.--A SORT OF SORITES, AS THE LOGICIANS CALL IT, TO SHOW THAT 
THE PARABLES OF THE LOST SHEEP AND THE LOST DRACHMA HAVE NO SUITABLE APPLICATION 
TO THE CHRIST OF MARCION.
WhO sought after the lost sheep and the lost piece of silver? Was it not the 
loser? But who was the loser? Was it not he who once possessed 
them? Who, then, was that? Was it not he to whom they belonged? Since, then, 
man is the property of none other than the Creator, He possessed Him who owned 
him; He lost him who once possessed him; He sought him who lost him; He found 
him who sought him; He rejoiced who found him. Therefore the purport of neither 
parable has anything whatever to do with him to whom belongs neither the sheep 
nor the piece of silver, that is to say, man. For he lost him not, because he 
possessed him not; and he sought him not, because he lost him not; and he found 
him not, because he sought him not; and he rejoiced not, because he found him 
not. Therefore, to rejoice over the sinner's repentance--that is, at the 
recovery of lost man--is the attribute of Him who long ago professed that He 
would rather that the sinner should repent and not die. 
CHAP. XXXIII.--THE MARCIONITE INTERPRETATION OF GOD AND MAMMON REFUTED. 
THE PROPHETS JUSTIFY CHRIST'S ADMONITION AGAINST COVETOUSNESS AND PRIDE. 
JOHN BAPTIST THE LINK BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW DISPENSATIONS OF THE 
CREATOR. SO SAID CHRIST--BUT SO ALSO HAD ISAIAH SAID LONG BEFORE. ONE ONLY GOD, 
THE CREATOR, BY HIS OWN WILL CHANGED THE DISPENSATIONS.NO NEW GOD HAD A HAND IN 
THE CHANGE
What the two masters are who, He says, cannot be served, on the ground that 
while one is pleased the other must needs be displeased, He Himself makes clear, 
when He mentions God and mammon. Then, if you have no interpreter by you, you 
may learn 
again from Himself what He would have understood by mammon. For when advising 
us to provide for ourselves the help of friends in worldly affairs, after the 
example of that steward who, when removed from his office, relieves his lord's 
debtors by lessening their debts with a view to their recompensing him with 
their help, He said, "And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the 
mammon of unrighteousness," that is to say, of money, even as the steward had 
done. Now we are all of us aware that money is the instigator of 
unrighteousness, and the lord of the whole world. Therefore, when he saw the 
covetousness of the Pharisees doing servile worship to it, He hurled this 
sentence against them, "Ye cannot serve God and mammon." Then the Pharisees, who 
were covetous of riches, derided Him, when they understood that by mammon He 
meant money. Let no one think that under the word mammon the Creator was meant, 
and that Christ called them off from the service of the Creator. What folly! 
Rather learn therefrom that one God was pointed out by Christ. For they were two 
masters whom He named, God and mammon--the Creator and money. You cannot indeed 
serve God--Him, of course whom they seemed to serve--and mammon to whom they 
preferred to devote themselves. If, however, he was giving himself out as 
another god, it would not be two masters, but three, that he had pointed out. 
For the Creator was a master, and much more of a master, to be sure, than 
mammon, and more to be adored, as being more truly our Master. Now, how was it 
likely that He who had called mammon a master, and had associated him with God, 
should say nothing of Him who was really the Master of even these, that is, the 
Creator? Or else, by this silence respecting Him did He concede that service 
might be rendered to Him, since it was to Himself alone and to mammon that He 
said service could not be (simultaneously) rendered? When, therefore, He lays 
down the position that God is one, since He would have been sure to mention the 
Creator if He were Himself a rival to Him, He did (virtually) name the Creator, 
when He refrained from insisting" that He was Master alone, without a rival god. 
Accordingly, this will throw light upon the sense in which it was said, "If ye 
have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust 
the true riches?" "In the unrighteous mammon," that is to say, in unrighteous 
riches, not in the Creator; for even Marcion allows Him to be righteous: "And if 
ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who will give to you 
that which is mine?" For what ever is unrighteous ought to be foreign to the 
servants of God. But in what way was the Creator foreign to the Pharisees, 
seeing that He was the proper God of the Jewish nation? Forasmuch then as the 
words, "Who will entrust to you the truer riches?" and, "Who will give you that 
which is mine?" are only suitable to the Creator and not to mammon, He could not 
have uttered them as alien to the Creator, and in the interest of the rival god. 
He could only seem to have spoken them in this sense, if, when remarking their 
unfaithfulness to the Creator and not to mammon, He had drawn some distinctions 
between the Creator (in his manner of mentioning Him) and the rival god--how 
that the latter would not commit his own truth to those who were unfaithful to 
the Creator. How then can he possibly seem to belong to another god, if He be 
not set forth, with the express intention of being separated from the very thing 
which is in question. But when the Pharisees "justified themselves before men," 
16) and placed their hope of reward in man, He censured them in the sense in 
which the prophet Jeremiah said, "Cursed is the man that trust-eth in man." 
Since the prophet went on to say, "But the Lord knoweth your hearts," he 
magnified the power of that God who declared Himself to be as a lamp, "searching 
the reins and the heart." When He strikes at pride in the words: "That which is 
highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God," He recalls 
Isaiah: "For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud 
and lofty, and upon every one that is arrogant and lifted up, and they shall be 
brought low." I can now make out 
why Marcion's god was for so long an age concealed. He was, I suppose, 
waiting until he had learnt all these things from the Creator. He continued his 
pupillage up to the time of John, and then proceeded forthwith to announce the 
kingdom of God, saying: "The law and the prophets were until John; since that 
time the kingdom of God is proclaimed." Just as if we also did not recognise in 
John a certain limit placed between the old dispensation and the new, at which 
Judaism ceased and Christianity began--without, however, supposing that it was 
by the power of another god that there came about a cessation of the law and the 
prophets and the commencement of that gospel in which is the kingdom of God, 
Christ Himself. For although, as we have shown, the Creator foretold that the 
old state of things would pass away and a new state would succeed, yet, inasmuch 
as John is shown to be both the forerunner and the pre-pater of the ways of that 
Lord who was to introduce the gospel and publish the kingdom of God, it follows 
from the very fact that John has come, that Christ must be that very Being who 
was to follow His harbinger John. So that, if the old course has ceased and the 
new has begun, with John intervening between them, there will be nothing 
wonderful in it, because it happens according to the purpose of the Creator; so 
that you may get a better proof for the kingdom of God from any quarter, however 
anomalous, than from the conceit that the law and the prophets ended in John, 
and a new state of things began after him. "More easily, therefore, may heaven 
and earth pass away--as also the law and the prophets--than that one tittle of 
the Lord's words should fail." "For," as says Isaiah: "the word of our God shall 
stand for ever." Since even then by Isaiah it was Christ, the Word and Spirit of 
the Creator, who prophetically described John as "the voice of one crying in the 
wilderness to prepare the way of the Lord," and as about to come for the purpose 
of terminating thenceforth the course of the law and the prophets; by their 
fulfilment and not their extinction, and in order that the kingdom of God might 
be announced by Christ, He therefore purposely added the assurance that the 
elements would more easily pass away than His words fail; affirming, as He did, 
the further fact, that what He had said concerning John had not fallen to the 
ground. 
CHAP. XXXIV.--MOSES, ALLOWING DIVORCE, AND CHRIST PROHIBITING IT, 
EXPLAINED. JOHN BAPTIST AND HEROD. MARCION'S ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER AN ANTITHESIS 
IN THE PARABLE OF THE RICH MAN AND THE POOR MAN IN HADES CONFUTED. THE
CREATOR'S APPOINTMENT MANIFESTED IN BOTH STATES.
But Christ prohibits divorce, saying, "Whosoever putteth away his wife, and 
marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put 
away from her husband, also committeth adultery." In order to forbid divorce, He 
makes it unlawful to marry a woman that has been put away. Moses, however, 
permitted repudiation m Deuteronomy: "When a man hath taken a wife, and hath 
lived with her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because 
he hath found unchastity in her; then let him write her a bill of divorcement 
and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house." You see, 
therefore, that there is a difference between the law and the gospel- between 
Moses and Christ? To be sure there is! But then you have rejected that other 
gospel which witnesses to the same verity and the same Christ. There, while 
prohibiting divorce, He has given us a solution of this special question 
respecting it: "Moses," says He, "because of the hardness of your hearts, 
suffered you to give a bill of divorcement; but from the beginning it was not 
so"--for this reason, indeed, because He who had "made them male and female" had 
likewise said, "They twain shall become one flesh; what therefore God hath 
joined together, let not man put asunder." Now, by this answer of His (to the 
Pharisees), He both sanctioned the provision of Moses, who was His own 
(servant), and restored to its primitive purpose the institution of the Creator, 
whose Christ He was. Since, however, you are to be refuted out of the Scriptures 
which you have received, I will meet you on your own ground, as if your Christ 
were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited divorce, and yet at the same time 
represented the Father, even Him who united male and female, must He not have 
rather exculpated than abolished the enactment of Moses? But, observe, if this 
Christ be yours when he teaches contrary to Moses and the Creator, on the same 
principle must He be mine if I can show that 
His teaching is not contrary to them. I maintain, then, that there was a 
condition in the prohibition which He now made of divorce; the case supposed 
being, that a man put away his wife for the express purpose of marrying another. 
His words are: "Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, 
committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her 
husband, also committeth adultery,"--"put away," that is, for the reason 
wherefore a woman ought not to be dismissed, that another wife may be obtained. 
For he who marries a woman who is unlawfully put away is as much of an adulterer 
as the man who marries one who is un-divorced. Permanent is the marriage which 
is not rightly dissolved; to marry, therefore, whilst matrimony is undissolved, 
is to commit adultery. Since, therefore, His prohibition of divorce was a 
conditional one, He did not prohibit absolutely; and what He did not absolutely 
forbid, that He permitted on some occasions, 
when there is an absence of the cause why He gave His prohibition. In very 
deed His teaching is not contrary to Moses, whose precept He partially 
defends, I will not say confirms. If, however, you deny that divorce is in 
any way permitted by Christ, how is it that you on your side destroy marriage, 
not uniting man and woman, nor admitting to the sacrament of baptism and of the 
eucharist those who have been united in marriage anywhere else, 
unless they should agree together to repudiate the fruit of their marriage, 
and so the very Creator Himself? Well, then, what is a husband to do in your 
sect, if his wife commit adultery? Shall he keep her? But your own apostle, you 
know, does not permit "the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot." Divorce, 
therefore, when justly deserved, has even in Christ a defender. So that Moses 
for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits 
divorce in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the 
wife. For in the Gospel of Matthew he says, "Whosoever shall put away his wife, 
saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery." He also is 
deemed equally guilty of adultery, who marries a woman put away by her husband. 
The Creator, however, except on account of adultery, does not put asunder what 
He Himself joined together, the same Moses in another passage enacting that he 
who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth not have it in 
his power to put away his wife. Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted after 
violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a voluntary one, the result 
of agreement! This has the sanction of the prophet: "Thou shalt not forsake the 
wife of thy youth." Thus you have Christ following spontaneously the tracks of 
the Creator everywhere, both in permitting divorce and in for-bidding it. You 
find Him also protecting marriage, in whatever direction you try to escape. He 
prohibits divorce when He will have the marriage inviolable; He permits divorce 
when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you 
refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush 
when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them 
separated. I have now to show whence the Lord derived this decision of His, and 
to what end He directed it. It will thus become more fully evident that His 
object was not the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance by any suddenly devised 
proposal of divorce; because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in 
the previously mentioned John. For John reproved Herod, because he had illegally 
married the wife of his deceased brother, who had a daughter by her (a union 
which the law permitted only on the one occasion of the brother dying childless, 
when it even prescribed such a marriage, in order that by his own brother, and 
from his own wife, seed might be reckoned to the deceased husband), and was in 
consequence cast into prison, and finally, by the same Herod, was even put to 
death. The Lord having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the 
occurrence of his death, hurled His censure against Herod in the form of 
unlawful marriages and of adultery, pronouncing as an adulterer even the man who 
married a woman that had been put away from her husband. This he said in order 
the more severely to load Herod with guilt, who had taken his brother's wife, 
after she had been loosed from her husband not less by death than by divorce; 
who had been impelled 
thereto by his lust, not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law--for, as 
his brother had left a daughter, the marriage with the widow could not be lawful 
on that very account; and who, when the prophet asserted against him the law, 
had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be 
also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man 
tormented in hell, and the poor man resting in Abraham's bosom. For this 
passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard 
its sense and purport, it naturally fits in with the mention of John wickedly 
slain, and of Herod, who had been condemned by him for his impious marriage. It 
sets forth in bold outline the end of both of them, the "torments" of Herod and 
the "comfort" of John, that even now Herod might hear that warning: "They have 
there Moses and the prophets, let them hear them." Marcion, however, violently 
turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the 
comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life for those who 
have obeyed the law and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and 
harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the 
Scripture itself which dazzles his sight expressly distinguishes between 
Abraham's bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. 
"Hell" (I take it) means one thing, and "Abraham's bosom" another. "A great 
gulf." is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to 
the other. Besides, the rich man could not have "lifted up his eyes," and from a 
distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up 
through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to 
every man of intelligence who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there 
is some determinate place called Abraham's bosom, and that it is designed for 
the reception of the souls of Abraham's children, even from among the Gentiles 
(since he is "the father of many nations," which must be classed amongst his 
family), and of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed God, 
without the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region, 
therefore, I call Abraham's bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet 
higher than hell, and is appointed to afford an interval of rest to the souls of 
the righteous, until the consummation of all things shall complete the 
resurrection of all men with the "full recompense of their reward." This 
consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, 
however, claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced 
them. Amos, however, tells us of "those stories towards heaven" which Christ 
"builds"--of course for His people. There also is that everlasting abode of 
which Isaiah asks, "Who shall declare unto you the eternal place, but He (that 
is, of course, Christ) who walketh in righteousness, speaketh of the straight 
path, hateth injustice and iniquity?" Now, although this everlasting abode is 
promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are built by the 
Creator, who further promises that the seed of Abraham shall be even as the 
stars of heaven, by virtue certainly of the heavenly promise, why may it not be 
possible, without any injury to that promise, that by Abraham's bosom is meant 
some temporary receptacle of faithful souls, wherein is even now delineated an 
image of the future, and where is given some foresight of the glory of both 
judgments? If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a 
warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His 
only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal 
salvation rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive. Well, 
but the admonition, says Marcion, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to 
hear Moses and the prophets, but Christ; Hear Him is the command. This is true 
enough. For the apostles had by that time sufficiently heard Moses and the 
prophets, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded by Moses and the 
prophets. For even Peter would not have been able to say, "Thou art the Christ," 
unless he had beforehand heard and believed Moses and the prophets, by whom 
alone Christ had been hitherto announced. Their faith, indeed, had deserved this 
confirmation by such a voice from heaven as should bid them hear 
Him, whom they had recognized as preaching peace, announcing glad tidings, 
promising an everlasting abode, building for them steps upwards into heaven. 
Down in hell, however, it was said concerning them: "They have Moses and the 
prophets; let them hear them!"--event hose who did not believe them or at least 
did not sincerely believe that after death there were punishments for the 
arrogance of wealth and the glory of luxury, announced indeed by Moses and the 
prophets, but decreed by that God, who deposes princes from their thrones, and 
raiseth up the poor from dunghills. Since, therefore, it is quite consistent in 
the Creator to pronounce different sentences in the two directions of reward and 
punishment, we shall have to conclude that there is here no diversity of gods, 
but only a difference in the actual matters before us. 
CHAP. XXXV.--THE JUDICIAL SEVERITY OF CHRIST AND THE TENDERNESS OF THE 
CREATOR, ASSERTED IN CONTRADICTION TO MARCION. THE CURE OF THE TEN LEPERS. OLD 
TESTAMENT ANALOGIES. THE KINGDOM OF GOD WITHIN YOU; THIS TEACHING SIMILAR TO 
THAT OF MOSES. CHRIST, THE STONE REJECTED BY THE BUILDERS. INDICATIONS OF 
SEVERITY IN THE COMING OF CHRIST. PROOFS THAT HE IS NOT THE IMPASSIBLE BEING
MARCION IMAGINED.
Then, turning to His disciples, He says: "Woe unto him through whom offences 
come! It were better for him if he had not been born, or if a millstone were 
hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea, than that he should offend 
one of these little ones," that is, one of His disciples. Judge, then, what the 
sort of punishment is which He so severely threatens. For it is no stranger who 
is to avenge the offence done to His disciples. Recognise also in Him the Judge, 
and one too, who expresses Himself on the safety of His followers with the same 
tenderness as that which the Creator long ago exhibited: "He that toucheth you 
toucheth the apple of my eye." Such identity of care proceeds from one and the 
same Being. A trespassing brother He will have rebuked. If one failed in this 
duty of reproof, he in fact sinned, either because out of hatred he wished his 
brother to continue in sin, or else spared him from mistaken friendship, 
although possessing the injunction in Leviticus: "Thou shalt not hate thy 
brother in thine heart; thy neighbor thou shalt seriously rebuke, and on his 
account shalt not contract sin." Nor is it to be wondered at, if He thus teaches 
who forbids your refusing to bring back even your brother's cattle, if you find 
them astray in the road; much more should you bring back your erring brother to 
himself. He commands you to forgive your brother, should he trespass against you 
even "seven times." But that surely, is a small matter; for with the Creator 
there is a larger grace, when He sets no limits to forgiveness, indefinitely 
charging you "not to bear any malice against your brother," and to give not 
merely to him who asks, but even to him who does not ask. For His will is, not 
that you should forgive an offence, but forget it. The law about lepers had a 
profound meaning as respects the forms of the disease itself, and of the 
inspection by the high priest. The interpretation of this sense it will be our 
task to ascertain. Marcion's labour, however, is to object to us the strictness 
of the law, with the view of maintaining that here also Christ is its 
enemy--forestalling its enactments even in His cure of the ten lepers. These He 
simply commanded to show themselves to the priest; "and as they went, He 
cleansed them"--without a touch, and without a word, by His silent power and 
simple will. Well, but what necessity was there for Christ, who had been once 
for all announced as the healer of our sicknesses and sins,and had proved 
Himself such by His acts, to busy Himself with inquiries into the qualities and 
details of cures; or for the Creator to be summoned to the scrutiny of the law 
in the person of Christ? If any pan of this healing was effected by Him in a way 
different from the law, He yet Himself did it to perfection; for surely the Lord 
may by Himself, or by His Son, produce after one manner, and after another 
manner by His servants the prophets, those proofs of His power and might 
especially, which (as excelling in glory and strength, because they are His own 
acts) rightly enough leave in the distance behind them the works which are done 
by His servants. But enough 
has been already said on this point in a former passage. Now, although He 
said in a preceding chapter, that "there were many lepers in lsrael in the days 
of Eliseus the prophet, and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian," 
yet of course the mere number proves nothing towards a diferenee in the gods, as 
tending to the abasement of the Creator in curing only one, and the pre-eminence 
of Him who healed ten. For who can doubt that many might have been cured by Him 
who cured one more easily than ten by him who had never healed one before? But 
His main purpose in this declaration was to strike at the unbelief or the pride 
of Israel, in that (although there were many lepers amongst them, and a prophet 
was not wanting to them) not one had been moved even by so conspicuous an 
example to betake himself to God who was working in His prophets. Forasmuch, 
then, as He was Himself the veritable High Priest of God the Father, He 
inspected them according to the hidden purport of the law, which signified that 
Christ was the true distinguisher and extinguisher of the defilements of 
mankind. However, what was obviously required by the law He commanded should be 
done: "Go," said He, "show yourselves to the priests." Yet why this, if He meant 
to cleanse them first? Was it as a despiser of the law, in order to prove to 
them that, having been cured already on the road, the law was now nothing to 
them, nor even the priests? Well, the matter must of course pass as it best may, 
if anybody supposes that Christ had such views as these! But there are certainly 
better interpretations to be found of the passage, and more deserving of belief: 
how that they were cleansed on this account, because they were obedient, and 
went as the law required, when they were commanded to go to the priests; and it 
is not to be believed that persons who observed the law could have found a cure 
from a god that was destroying the law. Why, however, did He not give such a 
command to the leper who first returned? Because Elisha did not in the case of 
Naaman the Syrian, and yet was not on that account less the Creator's agent? 
This is a sufficient answer. But the believer knows that there is a pro-founder 
reason. Consider, therefore, the true motives. The miracle was performed in the 
district of Samaria, to which country also belonged one of the lepers. Samaria, 
however, had revolted from Israel, carrying with it the disaffected nine tribes, 
which, having been alienated by the prophet Ahijah, Jeroboam settled in Samaria. 
Besides, the Samaritans were always pleased with the mountains and the wells of 
their ancestors. Thus, in the Gospel of John, the woman of Samaria, when 
conversing with the Lord at the well, says, "No doubt Thou art greater," etc.; 
and again, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; but ye say, that in 
Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship." Accordingly, He who said, 
"Woe unto them that trust in the mountain of Samaria," vouchsafing now to 
restore that very region, purposely requests the men "to go and show themselves 
to the priests," because these were to be found only there where the temple was; 
submitting the Samaritan to the Jew, inasmuch as "salvation was of the Jews," 
whether to the Israelite or the Samaritan. To the tribe of Judah, indeed, wholly 
appertained the promised Christ, in order that men might know that at Jerusalem 
were both the priests and the temple; that there also was the womb of religion, 
and its living fountain, not its mere "well." Seeing, therefore, that they 
recognised the truth that at Jerusalem the law was to be fulfilled, He healed 
them. whose salvation was to come of faith without the ceremony of the law. 
Whence also, astonished that one only out of the ten was thankful for his 
release to the divine grace, He does not command him to offer a gift according 
to the law, because he had already paid his tribute of gratitude when "he 
glorified God; for thus did the Lord will that the law's requirement should be 
interpreted. And yet who was the God to whom the Samaritan gave thanks, because 
thus far not even had an Israelite heard of another god? Who else but He by whom 
all had hitherto been 
healed through Christ? And therefore it was said to him, "Thy faith hath made 
thee whole," because he had discovered that it was his duty to render the true 
oblation to Almighty God--even thanksgiving--in His true temple, and before His 
true High Priest Jesus Christ. But it is impossible either that the Pharisees 
should seem to have inquired of the Lord about the coming of the kingdom of the 
rival god, when no other god has ever yet been announced by Christ; or that He 
should have answered them concerning the kingdom of any other god than Him of 
whom they were in the habit of asking Him. "The kingdom of God," He says, 
"cometh not with observation; neither do they say, La here! or, lo there! for, 
behold, the kingdom of God is within you." Now, who will not interpret the words 
"within you" to mean in your hand, within your power, if you hear, and do the 
commandment of God? If, however, the kingdom of God lies in His commandment, set 
before your mind Moses on the other side, according to our antitheses, and you 
will find the self-same view of the case. "The commandment is not a lofty one, 
neither is it far off from thee. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, 
'Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, 
and do it?' nor is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, 'Who shall go 
over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?' But 
the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, and in thy 
hands, to do it." This means, "Neither in this place nor that place is the 
kingdom of God; for, behold, it is within you." And if the heretics, in their 
audacity, should contend that the Lord did not give an answer about His own 
kingdom, but only about the Creator's kingdom, concerning which they had 
inquired, then the following words are against them. For He tells them that "the 
Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected," before His coming, at 
which His kingdom will be really revealed. In this statement He shows that it 
was His own kingdom which His answer to them had contemplated, and which was now 
awaiting His own sufferings and rejection. But having to be rejected and 
afterwards to be acknowledged, and taken up and glorified, He borrowed the very 
word "rejected" from the passage, where, under the figure of a stone, His 
twofold manifestation was celebrated by David--the first in rejection, the 
second in honour: "The stone," says He, "which the builders rejected, is become 
the head-stone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing." Now it would be idle, 
if we believed that God had predicted the humiliation, or even the glory, of any 
Christ at all, that He could have signed His prophecy for any but Him whom He 
had foretold under the figure of a stone, and a rock, and a mountain. If, 
however, He speaks of His own coming, why does He compare it with the days of 
Noe and of Lot, which were dark and terrible--a mild and gentle God as He is? 
Why does He bid us "remember Lot's wife," who despised the Creator's command, 
and was punished for her contempt, if He does not come with judgment to avenge 
the infraction of His precepts? If He really does punish, like the Creator, if 
He is my Judge, He ought not to have adduced examples for the purpose of 
instructing me from Him whom He yet destroys, that He might not seem to be my 
instructor. But if He does not even here speak of His own coming, but of the 
coming of the Hebrew Christ, let us still wait in expectation that He will 
vouchsafe to us some prophecy of His own advent; meanwhile we will continue to 
believe that He is none other than He whom He reminds us of in every passage. 
CHAP. XXXVI.--THE PARABLES OF THE IMPORTUNATE WIDOW, AND OF THE PHARISEE 
AND THE PUBLICAN. CHRIST'S ANSWER TO THE RICH RULER, THE CURE OF THE 
BLIND MAN. HIS SALUTATION--SON OF DAVID. ALL PROOFS OF CHRIST'S RELATION TO THE 
CREATOR, MARCION'S ANTITHESIS BETWEEN DAVID AND CHRIST CONFUTED.
When He recommends perseverance and earnestness in prayer, He sets before us 
the parable of the judge who was compelled to listen to the widow, owing to the 
earnestness and importunity of her requests. He show us that it is God the judge 
whom we must importune with prayer, and not Himself, if He is not Himself the 
judge. But He added, that "God would avenge His own elect." Since, then, He who 
judges will also Himself be the avenger, He proved that the Creator 
is on that account the specially good God, whom He represented as the avenger 
of His own elect, who cry day and night to Him, And yet, when He introduces to 
our view the Creator's temple, and describes two men worshipping therein with 
diverse feelings--the Pharisee in pride, the publican in humility--and shows us 
how they accordingly went down to their homes, one rejected, the other 
justified, He surely, by thus teaching us the proper discipline of prayer, has 
determined that that God must be prayed to from whom men were to receive this 
discipline of prayer --whether condemnatory of pride, or justifying in humility. 
I do not find from Christ any temple, any suppliants, any sentence (of approval 
or condemnation) belonging to any other god than the Creator. Him does He enjoin 
us to worship in humility, as the lifter-up of the humble, not in pride, because 
He brings down the proud. 
What other god has He manifested to me to receive my supplications? With what 
formula of worship, with what hope (shall I approach him?) I trow, none. For the 
prayer which He has taught us suits, as we have proved, none but the Creator. It 
is, of course, another matter if He does not wish to be prayed to, because He is 
the supremely and spontaneously good God! But who is this good God? There is, He 
says, "none but one." It is not as if He had shown us that one of two gods was 
the supremely good; but He expressly asserts that there is one only good God, 
who is the only good, because He is the only God. 
Now, undoubtedly, He is the good God who "sendeth rain on the just and on the 
unjust, and maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good;" 
sustaining and nourishing and assisting even Marcionites themselves! When 
afterwards "a certain man asked him, 'Good Master, what shall I do to inherit 
eternal life?'" (Jesus) inquired whether he knew (that is, in other words, 
whether he kept) the commandments of the Creator, in order to testify that it 
was by the Creator's precepts that eternal life is acquired. Then, when he 
affirmed that from his youth up he had kept all the principal commandments, l 
(Jesus) said to him: "One thing thou yet lackest: sell all that thou hast, and 
give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me." 
Well now, Marcion, and all ye who are companions in misery, and associates in 
hatred with that heretic, what will you dare say to this? Did Christ rescind the 
forementioned commandments: "Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, 
Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother?" Or did He both 
keep them, and then add what was wanting to them? This very precept, however, 
about giving to the poor, was very largely diffused through the pages of the law 
and the prophets. This vainglorious observer of the commandments was therefore 
convicted of holding money in much higher estimation (than charity). This verity 
of the gospel then stands unimpaired: "I am not come to destroy the law and the 
prophets, but rather to fulfil them." He also dissipated other doubts, when He 
declared that the name of God and of the Good belonged to one and the same 
being, at whose disposal were also the everlasting life and the treasure in 
heaven and Himself too--whose commandments He both maintained and augmented with 
His own supplementary precepts. He may likewise be discovered in the following 
passage of Micah, saying: "He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what 
doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to be 
ready to follow the Lord thy God?" Now Christ is the man who tells us what is 
good, even the knowledge of the law. "Thou knowest," says He, "the 
commandments." "To do justly"--"Sell all that thou hast;" "to love mercy"--"Give 
to the poor:" "and to be ready to walk with God"--"And come," says He, "follow 
me." The Jewish nation was from its beginning so carefully divided into tribes 
and clans, and families and houses, that no man could very well have been 
ignorant of his descent--even from the recent assessments of Augustus, which 
were still probably extant at this time. But the Jesus of Marcion (although 
there could be no doubt of a person's having been born, who was seen to be a 
man), as being unborn, could not, of course, have possessed any public 
testimonial of his descent, but was to be regarded as one of that obscure class 
of whom nothing was in any way 
known. Why then did the blind man, on hearing that He was passing by, 
exclaim, "Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me?" unless he was considered, 
in no uncertain manner, to be the Son of David (in other words, to belong to 
David's family) through his mother and his brethren, who at some time or other 
had been made known to him by public notoriety? "Those, however, who went before 
rebuked the blind man, that he should hold his peace." And properly enough; 
because he was very noisy, not because he was wrong about the son of David Else 
you must show me, that those who rebuked him were aware that Jesus was not the 
Son of David, in order that they may be supposed to have had this reason for 
imposing silence on the blind man. But even if you could show me this, still 
(the blind man) would more readily have presumed that they were ignorant, than 
that the Lord could possibly have permitted an untrue exclamation about Himself. 
But the Lord "stood patient." Yes; but not as confirming the error, for, on the 
contrary, He rather displayed the Creator. Surely He could not have first 
removed this man's blindness, in order that he might afterwards cease to regard 
Him as the Son of David! However, that you may not slander His patience, nor 
fasten on Him any charge of dissimulation, nor deny Him to be the Son of David, 
He very pointedly confirmed the exclamation of the blind man--both by the actual 
gift of healing, and by bearing testimony to his faith: "Thy faith," say Christ, 
"hath made thee whole." What would you have the blind man's faith to have been? 
That Jesus was descended from that (alien) god (of Marcion), to subvert the 
Creator and overthrow the law and the prophets? That He was not the destined 
offshoot from the root of Jesse, and the fruit of David's loins, the restorer 
also of the blind? But I apprehend there were at that time no such stone-blind 
persons as Marcion, that an opinion like this could have constituted the faith 
of the blind man, and have induced him to confide in the mere named of Jesus, 
the Son of David. He, who knew all this of Himself, and wished others to know it 
also, endowed the faith of this man--although it was already gifted with a 
better sight, and although it was in possession of the true light--with the 
external vision likewise, in order that we too might learn the rule of faith, 
and at the same time find its recompense. Whosoever wishes to see Jesus the Son 
of David must believe in Him; through the Virgin's birth. He who will not 
believe this will not hear from Him the salutation, "Thy faith hath saved thee." 
And so he will remain blind, falling into Antithesis after Antithesis, which 
mutually destroy each other, just as "the blind man leads the blind down into 
the ditch." For (here is one of Marcion's Antitheses): whereas David in old 
time, in the capture of Sion, was offended by the blind who opposed his 
admission (into the stronghold)--in which respect (I should rather say) that 
they were a type of people equally blind, who in after-times would not admit 
Christ to be the son of David--so, on the contrary, Christ succoured the blind 
man, to show by this act that He was not David's son, and how different in 
disposition He was, kind to the blind, while David ordered them to be slain. If 
all this were so, why did Marcion allege that the blind man's faith was of so 
worthless a stamp? The fact is, the Son of David so acted, that the Antithesis 
must lose its point by its own absurdity. Those persons who offended David were 
blind, and the man who now presents himself as a suppliant to David's son is 
afflicted with the same infirmity. Therefore the Son of David was appeased with 
some sort of satisfaction by the blind man when He restored him to sight, and 
added His approval of the faith which had led him to believe the very truth, 
that he must win to his help the Son of David by earnest entreaty. But, after 
all, I suspect that it was the audacity (of the old Jebusites) which offended 
David, and not their malady. 
CHAP. XXXVII.--CHRIST AND ZACCHAEUS. THE SALVATION OF THE BODY AS DENIED 
BY MARCION. THE PARABLE OF THE TEN SERVANTS ENTRUSTED WITH TEN POUNDS. CHRIST A 
JUDGE, WHO IS TO ADMINISTER THE WILL OF THE AUSTERE MAN, I.E. THE CREATOR.
"Salvation comes to the house" of Zac 112 
chaeus even. For what reason? Was it because he also believed that Christ 
came by Marcion? But the blind man's cry was still sounding in the ears of all: 
"Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me." And "all the people gave praise 
unto God"--not Marcion's, but David's. Now, although Zacchaeus was probably a 
Gentile, he yet from his intercourse with Jews had obtained a smattering of 
their Scriptures, and, more than this, had, without knowing it, fulfilled the 
precepts of Isaiah: "Deal thy bread," said the prophet, "to the hungry, and 
bring the poor that are cast out into thine house." This he did in the best 
possible way, by receiving the Lord, and entertaining Him in his house. "When 
thou seest the naked cover him." This he promised to do, in an equally 
satisfactory way, when he offered the half of his goods for all works of mercy. 
So also "he loosened the bands of wickedness. undid the heavy burdens, let the 
oppressed go free, and broke every yoke," when he said, "If I have taken 
anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold." Therefore 
the Lord said, "This day is salvation come to this house." Thus did He give His 
testimony, that the precepts of the Creator spoken by the prophet tended to 
salvation. But when He adds, "For the Son of man is come to seek and to save 
that which was lost," my present contention is not whether He was come to save 
what was lost, to whom it had once belonged, and from whom what He came to save 
had fallen away; but I approach a different question. Man, there can be no doubt 
of it, is here the subject of consideration. Now, since he consists of two pans, 
body and soul, the point to be inquired into is, in which of these two man would 
seem to have been lost? If in his body, then it is his body, not his soul, which 
is lost. What, however, is lost, the Son of man saves. The body, therefore, has 
the salvation. If, (on the other hand,) it is in his soul that man is lost, 
salvation is designed for the lost soul; and the body which is not lost is safe. 
If, (to take the only other supposition,) man is wholly lost, in both his 
natures, then it necessarily follows that salvation is appointed for the entire 
man; and then the opinion of the heretics is shivered to pieces, who say that 
there is no salvation of the flesh. And this affords a confirmation that Christ 
belongs to the Creator, who followed the Creator in promising the salvation of 
the whole man. The parable also of the (ten) servants, who received their 
several recompenses according to the manner in which they had increased their 
lord's money by trading? proves Him to be a God of judgment--even a God who, in 
strict account, not only bestows honour, but also takes away what a man seems to 
have. Else, if it is the Creator whom He has here delineated as the "austere 
man," who "takes up what he laid not down, and reaps what he did not sow," my 
instructor even here is He, (whoever He may be,) to whom belongs the money He 
teaches me fruitfully to expend. 
CHAP. XXXVIII.--CHRIST'S REFUTATIONS OF THE PHARISEES. RENDERING DUES TO 
CAESAR AND TO GOD. NEXT OF THE SADDUCEES, RESPECTING MARRIAGE IN THE 
RESURRECTION. THESE PROVE HIM NOT TO BE MARCION'S BUT THE CREATOR'S CHRIST.
MARCION'S TAMPERINGS IN ORDER TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIS SECOND GOD, EXPOSED AND 
CONFUTED.
Christ knew "the baptism of John, whence it was." Then why did He ask them, 
as if He knew not? He knew that the Pharisees would not give Him an answer; then 
why did He ask in vain? Was it that He might judge them out of their own mouth, 
or their own heart? Suppose you refer these points to an excuse of the Creator, 
or to His comparison with Christ; then consider what would have happened if the 
Pharisees had replied to His question. Suppose their answer to have been, that 
John's baptism was "of men," they would have been immediately stoned to death. 
Some Marcion, in rivalry to Marcion, would have stood up and said: O most 
excellent God; how different are his ways from the Creator's! Knowing that men 
would rush down headlong over it, He placed them 
actually on the very precipice. For thus do men treat of the Creator 
respecting His law of the tree. But John's baptism was "from heaven." "Why, 
therefore," asks Christ, "did ye not believe him?" He therefore who had wished 
men to believe John, purposing to censure them because they had not believed 
him, belonged to Him whose sacrament John was administering. But, at any rate, 
when He actually met their refusal to say what they thought, with such reprisals 
as, "Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things," He returned evil 
for evil! ''Render unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the 
things which be God's." What will be "the things which are God's?" Such things 
as are like Caesar's denarius--that is to say, His image and similitude. That, 
therefore, which he commands to be "rendered unto God," the Creator, is man, who 
has been stamped with His image, likeness, name, and substance. Let Marcion's 
god look after his own mint. Christ bids the denarius of man's imprint to be 
rendered to His Caesar, (His Caesar I say,) not the Caesar of a strange god. The 
truth, however, must be confessed, this god has not a denarius to call his own! 
In every question the just and proper rule is, that the meaning of the answer 
ought to be adapted to the proposed inquiry. But it is nothing short of madness 
to return an answer altogether different from the question submitted to you. God 
forbid, then, that we should expect from Christ conduct which would be unfit 
even to an ordinary man! The Sadducees, who said there was no resurrection, in a 
discussion on that subject, had proposed to the Lord a case of law touching a 
certain woman, who, in accordance with the legal prescription, had been married 
to seven brothers who had died one after the other. The question therefore was, 
to which husband must she be reckoned to belong in the resurrection? This, 
(observe,) was the gist of the inquiry, this was the sum and substance of the 
dispute. And to it Christ was obliged to return a direct answer. He had nobody 
to fear; that it should seem advisable for Him either to evade their questions, 
or to make them the occasion of indirectly mooring a subject which He was not in 
the habit of teaching publicly at any other time. He therefore gave His answer, 
that "the children of this world marry." You see how pertinent it was to the 
case in point. Because the question concerned the next world, and He was going 
to declare that no one marries there, He opens the way by laying down the 
principles that here, where there is death, there is also marriage. "But they 
whom God shall account worthy of the possession of that world and the 
resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage; forasmuch 
as they cannot die any more, since they become equal to the angels, being made 
the children of God and of the resurrection." If, then, the meaning of the 
answer must not turn on any other point than on the proposed question, and since 
the question proposed is fully understood from this sense of the answer, then 
the Lord's reply admits of no other interpretation than that by which the 
question is clearly understood. You have both the time in which marriage is 
permitted, and the time in which it is said to be unsuitable, laid before you, 
not on their own account, but in consequence of an inquiry about the 
resurrection. You have likewise a confirmation of the resurrection itself, and 
the whole question which the Sadducees mooted, who asked no question about 
another god, nor inquired about the proper law of marriage. Now, if you make 
Christ answer questions which were not submitted to Him, you, in fact, represent 
Him as having been unable to solve the points on which He was really consulted, 
and entrapped of course by the cunning of the Sadducees. I shall now proceed, by 
way of supererogation, and after the rule (I have laid down about questions and 
answers), to deal with the arguments which have any consistency in them. They 
procured then a copy of the Scripture, and made short work with its text, by 
reading it thus: "Those whom the god of that world shall account worthy." They 
add the phrase "of that world" to the word "god," whereby they make another 
god"the god of that world;" whereas the passage ought to be read thus: "Those 
whom God shall account worthy of the possession of that world" (removing the 
distinguishing phrase "of this world" to the end of the clause, in other words, 
"Those whom God shall account worthy of obtaining and rising to that world." For 
the question submitted to Christ had nothing to do with the god, but only with 
the state, of that world. It was: "Whose wife should this woman be in that world 
after the resurrection?" They thus subvert His answer respecting the essential 
question of marriage, and apply His words, "The children of this world marry and 
are given in marriage," as if they referred to the Creator's men, and His 
permission to them to marry; whilst they themselves whom the god of that 
world--that is, the rival god--accounted worthy of the resurrection, do not 
marry even here, because they are not children of this world. But the fact is, 
that, having been consulted about marriage in that world, not in this present 
one, He had simply declared the non-existence of that to which the question 
related. They, indeed, who had caught the very force of His voice, and 
pronunciation, and expression, discovered no other sense than what had reference 
to the matter of the question. Accordingly, the Scribes exclaimed, "Master, Thou 
hast well said." For He had affirmed the resurrection, by describing the form 
thereof in opposition to the opinion of the Sadducees. Now, He did not reject 
the attestation of those who had assumed His answer to bear this meaning. If, 
however, the Scribes thought Christ was David's Son, whereas (David) himself 
calls Him Lord, what relation has this to Christ? David did not literally 
confute an error of the Scribes, yet David asserted the honour of Christ, when 
he more prominently affirmed that He was his Lord than his Son,--an attribute 
which was hardly suitable to the destroyer of the Creator. But how consistent is 
the interpretation on our side of the question! For He, who had been a little 
while ago invoked by the blind man as "the Son of David," 
then made no remark on the subject, not having the Scribes in His presence; 
whereas He now purposely moots the point before them, and that of His own 
accord, in order that He might show Himself whom the Mind man, following the 
doctrine of the Scribes, had simply declared to be the Son of David, to be also 
his Lord. He thus honoured the blind man's faith which had acknowledged His 
Sonship to David; but at the same time He struck a blow at the tradition of the 
Scribes, which prevented them from knowing that He was also (David's) 
Lord. Whatever had relation to the glory of the Creator's Christ, no other 
would thus guard and maintain but Himself the Creator's Christ. 
CHAP. XXXIX.--CONCERNING THOSE WHO COME IN THE NAME OF CHRIST. THE 
TERRIBLE SIGNS OF HIS COMING. HE WhOSE COMING IS 
SO GRANDLY DESCRIBED BOTH IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE NEW TESTAMENT, IS 
NONE OTHER THAN THE CHRIST OF THE CREATOR. THIS PROOF ENHANCED BY THE PARABLE OF 
THE FIG-TREE AND ALL THE TREES. PARALLEL PASSAGES OF PROPHECY.
As touching the propriety of His names, it has already been seen that both of 
them" are suitable to Him who was the first both to announce His Christ to 
mankind, and to give Him the further name of Jesus. The impudence, therefore, of 
Marcion's Christ will be evident, when he says that many will come in his name, 
whereas this name does not at all belong to him, since he is not the Christ and 
Jesus of the Creator, to whom these names do properly appertain; and more 
especially when he prohibits those to be received whose very equal in imposture 
he is, inasmuch as he (equally with them ) comes in a name which belongs to 
another--unless it was his business to warn off from a mendaciously assumed name 
the disciples (of One) who, by reason of His name being properly given to Him, 
possessed also the verity thereof. But when "they shall by and by come and say, 
I am Christ," they will be received by you, who have already received one 
altogether like them. Christ, however, comes in His own 
name. What will you do, then, when He Himself comes who is the very 
Proprietor of these names, the Creator's Christ and Jesus? Will you reject Him? 
But how iniquitous, how unjust and disrespectful to the good God, that you 
should not receive Him who comes in His own name, when you have received another 
in His name! Now, let us see what are the signs which He ascribes to the times. 
"Wars," I observe, "and kingdom against kingdom, and nation against nation, and 
pestilence, and famines, and earthquakes, and fearful sights, and great signs 
from heaven"--all which things are suitable for a severe and terrible God. Now, 
when He goes on to say that "all these things must needs come to pass," what 
does He represent Himself to be? The Destroyer, or the Defender of the Creator? 
For He affirms thai these appointments of His must fully come to pass; but 
surely as the good God, He would have frustrated rather than advanced events so 
sad and terrible, if they had not been His own (decrees). "But before all 
these," He foretells that persecutions and sufferings were to come upon them, 
which indeed were "to turn for a testimony to them," and for their salvation. 
Hear what is predicted in Zechariah: "The Lord of hosts shall protect them; and 
they shall devour them, and subdue them with sling-stones; and they shall drink 
their blood like wine, and they shall fill the bowls as it were of the altar. 
And the Lord shall save them in that day, even His people, like sheep; because 
as sacred stones they roll," etc. And that you may not suppose that these 
predictions refer to such sufferings as await them from so many wars with 
strangers, consider the nature (of the sufferings). In a prophecy of wars which 
were to be waged with legitimate arms, no one would think of enumerating stones 
as weapons, which are better known in popular crowds and unarmed tumults. Nobody 
measures the copious streams of blood which flow in war by bowlfuls, nor limits 
it to what is shed upon a single altar. No one gives the name of sheep to those 
who fall in battle with arms in hand, and while repelling force with force, but 
only to those who are slain, yielding themselves up in their own place of duty 
and with patience, rather than fighting in self-defence. In short, as he says, 
"they roll as sacred stones," and not like soldiers fight. Stones are they, even 
foundation stones, upon which we are ourselves edified--"built," as St.Paul 
says, "upon the foundation of the apostles," who, like "consecrated stones," 
were rolled up and down exposed to the attack of all men. And therefore in this 
passage He forbids men "to meditate before what they answer" when brought before 
tribunals, even as once He suggested to Balaam the message which he had not 
thought of, nay, contrary to what he had thought; and promised "a mouth" to 
Moses, when he pleaded in excuse the slowness of his speech, and that wisdom 
which, by Isaiah, He showed to be irresistible: "One shall say, I am the Lord's, 
and shall call himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe himself 
by the name of lsrael." Now, what plea is wiser and more irresistible than the 
simple and open" confession made in a martyr's cause, who "prevails with 
God"--which is what "Israel" 
means? Now, one cannot wonder that He forbade "premeditation," who actually 
Himself received from the Father the ability of uttering words in season: "The 
Lord hath given to me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak 
a word in season (to him that is weary);" except that Marcion introduces to us a 
Christ who is not subject to the Father. That persecutions from one's nearest 
friends are predicted, and calumny out of hatred to His name, I need not again 
refer to. But "by patience," says He, "ye shall yourselves be saved." Of this 
very patience the Psalm says, "The patient endurance of the just shall not 
perish for ever;" because it is said in another Psalm, "Precious (in the sight 
of the Lord) is the death of the just"--arising, no doubt, out of their patient 
endurance, so that Zechariah declares: "A crown shall be to them that endure." 
But that you may not boldly contend that it was as announcers of another god 
that the apostles were persecuted by the Jews, remember that even the prophets 
suffered the same treatment of the Jews, and that they were not the heralds of 
any other god than the Creator. Then, having shown what was to be the period of 
the destruction, even "when Jerusalem should 
begin to be compassed with armies," He described the signs of the end of all 
things: "portents in the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and upon the earth 
distress of nations in perplexity--like the sea roaring--by reason of their 
expectation of the evils which are coming on the earth." That "the very powers 
also of heaven have to be shaken," you may find in Joel: "And I will show 
wonders in the heavens and in the earth--blood and fire, and pillars of smoke; 
the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great 
and terrible day of the Lord come." In Habakkuk also you have this statement: 
"With rivers shall the earth be cleaved; the nations shall see thee, and be m 
pangs. Thou shalt disperse the waters with thy step; the deep uttered its voice; 
the height of its fear was raised; the sun and the moon stood still in their 
course; into light shall thy coruscations go; and thy shield shall be (like) the 
glittering of the lightning's flash; in thine anger thou shalt grind the earth, 
and shalt thresh the nations in thy wrath." There is thus an agreement, I 
apprehend, between the sayings of the Lord and of the prophets touching the 
shaking of the earth, and the elements, and the nations thereof. But what does 
the Lord say afterwards? "And then shall they see the Son of man coming from the 
heavens with very great power. And when these things shall come to pass, ye 
shall look up, and raise your heads; for your redemption hath come near," that 
is, at the time of the kingdom, of which the parable itself treats. "So likewise 
ye, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God 
is nigh at hand." This will be the great day of the Lord, and of the glorious 
coming of the Son of man from heaven, of which Daniel wrote: "Behold, one like 
the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven," etc. "And there was given unto 
Him the kingly power," which (in the parable) "He went away into a far country 
to receive for Himself," leaving money to His servants wherewithal to trade and 
get increase--even (that universal kingdom of) all nations, which in the Psalm 
the Father had promised to give to Him: Ask of me, and I 
will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance." "And all that glory shall 
serve Him; His dominion shall be an everlasting one, which shall not be taker 
from Him, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed," because in it "men 
shall not die, neither shall they marry, but be like the angels." It is about 
the same advent of the Son of man and the benefits thereof that we read in 
Habakkuk: "Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, even to save 
Thine anointed ones,--in other words, those who shall look up and lift their 
heads, being redeemed in the time of His kingdom. Since, therefore, these 
descriptions of the promises, on the one hand, agree together, as do also those 
of the great catastrophes, on the other--both in the predictions of the prophets 
and the declarations of the Lord, it will be impossible for you to interpose any 
distinction between them, as if the catastrophes could be referred to the 
Creator, as the terrible God, being such as the good god (of Marcion) ought not 
to permit, much less expect --whilst the promises should be ascribed to the good 
god, being such as the Creator, in His ignorance of the said god, could not have 
predicted. If, however, He did predict these promises as His own, since they 
differ in no respect from the promises of Christ, He will be a match in the 
freeness of His gifts with the good god himself; and evidently no more will have 
been promised by your Christ than by my Son of man. (If you examine) the whole 
passage of this Gospel Scripture, from the inquiry of the disciples down to the 
parable of the fig-tree you will find the sense in its connection suit in every 
point the Son of man, so that it consistently ascribes to Him both the sorrows 
and the joys, and the catastrophes and the promises; nor can you separate them 
from Him in either respect. For asmuch, then, as there is but one Son of man 
whose advent is placed between the two issues of catastrophe and promise, it 
must needs follow that to that one Son of man belong both the judgments upon the 
nations, and the prayers of the saints. He who thus comes in midway so as to be 
common to both issues, will terminate one of them by inflicting judgment on the 
nations at His coming; and will at the same time commence the other by 
fulfilling the prayers of His saints: so that if (on the one hand) you grant 
that the coming of the Son of man is (the advent) of my Christ, then, when you 
ascribe to Him the infliction of the judgments which precede His appearance, you 
are compelled also to assign to 
Him the blessings which issue from the same. If (on the other hand) you will 
have it that it is the coming of your Christ, then, when you ascribe to him the 
blessings which are to be the result of his advent, you are obliged to impute to 
him likewise the infliction of the evils which precede his appearance. For the 
evils which precede, and the blessings which immediately follow, the coming of 
the Son of man, are both alike indissolubly connected with that event. Consider, 
therefore, which of the two Christs you choose to place in the person of the Son 
of man, to whom you may refer the execution of the two dispensations. You make 
either the Creator a most beneficent God, or else your own god terrible in his 
nature! Reflect, in short, on the picture presented in the parable: "Behold the 
fig-tree, and all the trees; when they produce their fruit, men know that summer 
is at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that 
the kingdom of God is very near." Now, if the fructification of the common trees 
be an antecedent sign of the approach of summer, so in like manner do the great 
conflicts of the world indicate the arrival of that kingdom which they precede. 
But every sign is His, to whom belong the thing of which it is the sign; and to 
everything is appointed its sign by Him to whom the thing belongs. If, 
therefore, these tribulations are the signs of the kingdom, just as the maturity 
of the trees is of the summer, it follows that the kingdom is the Creator's to 
whom are ascribed the tribulations which are the signs of the kingdom. Since the 
beneficent Deity had premised that these things must needs come to pass, 
although so terrible and dreadful, as they had been predicted by the law and the 
prophets, therefore He did not destroy the law and the prophets, when He 
affirmed that what had been foretold therein must be certainly fulfilled. He 
further declares, "that heaven and earth shall not pass away till all things be 
fulfilled." What things, pray, are these? Are they the things which the Creator 
made? Then the elements will tractably endure the accomplishment of their 
Maker's dispensation. If, however, they emanate from your excellent god, I much 
doubt whether the heaven and earth will peaceabIy allow the completion of things 
which their Creator's enemy has determined! If the Creator quietly submits to 
this, then He is no "jealous God." But let heaven and earth pass away, since 
their Lord has so determined; only let His word remain for evermore! And so 
Isaiah predicted that it should. Let the disciples also be warned, "lest their 
hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this world; 
and so that day come upon them unawares, like a snare "--if indeed they should 
forget God amidst the abundance and occupation of the world. Like this will be 
found the admonition of Moses,--so that He who delivers from "the snare" of that 
day is none other than He who so long before addressed to men the same 
admonition? Some places there were in Jerusalem where to teach; other places 
outside Jerusalem whither to retire--"in the day-time He was teaching in the 
temple;" just as He had foretold by Hosea: "In my house did they find me, and 
there did I speak with them." "But at night He went out to the Mount of Olives." 
For thus had Zechariah pointed out: "And His feet shall stand in that day on the 
Mount of Olives." Fit hours for an audience there also were. "Early in the 
morning" must they resort to Him, who (having said by Isaiah, "The Lord giveth 
me the tongue of the learned") added, "He hath appointed me the morning, and 
hath also given me an ear to hear." Now if this is to destroy the prophets, what 
will it be to fulfil them? 
CHAP. XL.--HOW THE STEPS IN THE PASSION OF THE SAVIOUR WERE PREDETERMINED 
IN PROPHECY. THE PASSOVER. THE TREACHERY OF JUDAS. THE INSTITUTION OF THE 
LORD'S SUPPER. THE DOCETIC ERROR OF MARCION CONFUTED BY THE BODY AND THE 
BLOOD OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
In like manner does He also know the very time it behoved Him to suffer, 
since the law prefigures His passion. Accordingly, of all the festal days of the 
Jews He chose the passover. In this Moses had declared that there was a sacred 
mystery: "It is the Lord's passover." How earnestly, therefore, does He manifest 
the bent of His soul: "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you 
before I suffer." What a destroyer of the law was this, who actually longed to 
keep 
its passover! Could it be that He was so fond of Jewish lamb? But was it not 
because He had to be "led like a lamb to the slaughter; and because, as a sheep 
before her shearers is dumb, so was He not to open His mouth," that He so 
profoundly wished to accomplish the symbol of His own redeeming blood? He might 
also have been betrayed by any stranger, did I not find that even here too He 
fulfilled a Psalm: "He who did eat bread with me hath lifted up his heel against 
me." And without a price might He have been betrayed. For what need of a traitor 
was there in the case of one who offered Himself to the people openly, and might 
quite as easily have been captured by force as taken by treachery? This might no 
doubt have been well enough for another Christ, but would not have been suitable 
in One who was accomplishing prophecies. For it was written, "The righteous one 
did they sell for silver." The very amount and the destination of the money, 
which on Judas' remorse was recalled from its first purpose of a fee, and 
appropriated to the purchase of a potter's field, as narrated in the Gospel of 
Matthew, were clearly foretold by Jeremiah: "And they took the thirty pieces of 
silver, the price of Him who was valued? and gave them for the potter's field." 
When He so earnestly expressed His desire to eat the passover, He considered it 
His own feast; for it would have been unworthy of God to desire to partake of 
what was not His own. Then, having taken the bread and given it to His 
disciples, He made it His own body, by saying, "This is my body," that is, the 
figure of my body. A figure, however, there could not have been, unless there 
were first a veritable body. An empty thing, or phantom, is incapable of a 
figure. If, however, (as Marcion might say,) He pretended the bread was His 
body, because He lacked the truth of bodily substance, it follows that He must 
have given bread for us. It would contribute very well to the support of 
Marcion's theory of a phantom body, that bread should have been crucified! But 
why call His body bread, and not rather (some other edible thing, say) a melon, 
which Marcion must have had in lieu of a heart! He did not understand how 
ancient was this figure of the body of Christ, who said Himself by Jeremiah: "I 
was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter, and I knew not that 
they devised a device against me, saying, Let us cast the tree upon His bread," 
which means, of course, the cross upon His body. And thus, casting light, as He 
always did, upon the ancient prophecies, He declared plainly enough what He 
meant by the bread, when He called the bread His own body. He likewise, when 
mentioning the cup and making the new testament to be sealed "in His blood," 
affirms the reality of His body. For no blood can belong to a body which is not 
a body of flesh. If any sort of body were presented to our view, which is not 
one of flesh, not being fleshly, it would not possess blood. Thus, from the 
evidence of the flesh, we get a proof of the body, and a proof of the flesh from 
the evidence of the blood. In order, however, that you may discover how 
anciently wine is used as a figure for blood, turn to Isaiah, who asks, "Who is 
this that cometh from Edom, from Bosor with garments dyed in red, so glorious in 
His apparel, in the greatness of his might? Why are thy garments red, and thy 
raiment as his who cometh from the treading of the full winepress?" The 
prophetic Spirit contemplates the Lord as if He were already on His way to His 
passion, clad in His fleshly nature; and as He was to suffer therein, He 
represents the bleeding condition of His flesh under the metaphor of garments 
dyed in red, as if reddened in the treading and crushing process of the 
wine-press, from which the labourers descend reddened with the wine-juice, like 
men stained in blood. Much more clearly still does the book of Genesis foretell 
this, when 
(in the blessing of Judah, out of whose tribe Christ was to come according to 
the flesh) it even then delineated Christ in the person of that patriarch, 
saying, "He washed His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of 
grapes"--in His garments and clothes the prophecy pointed out his flesh, and His 
blood in the wine. Thus did He now consecrate His blood in wine, who then (by 
the patriarch) used the figure of wine to describe His blood. 
CHAP. XLI.--THE WOE PRONOUNCED ON THE TRAITOR A JUDICIAL ACT, WHICH 
DISPROVES CHRIST TO BE SUCH AS MARCION WOULD HAVE HIM TO BE. CHRIST'S CONDUCT 
BEFORE THE COUNCIL EXPLAINED.CHRIST EVEN THEN DIRECTS THE MINDS OF HIS JUDGES TO 
THE PROPHETIC EVIDENCES OF HIS OWN MISSION. THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THESE 
MEN ASSERTED.
"Woe," says He, "to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!" Now it is 
certain that in this woe must be understood the imprecation and threat of an 
angry and incensed Master, unless Judas was to escape with impunity after so 
vast a sin. If he were meant to escape with impunity, the was an idle word; if 
not, he was of course to be punished by Him against whom he had committed the 
sin of treachery. Now, if He knowingly permitted the man, whom He deliberately 
elected to be one of His companions, to plunge into so great a crime, you must 
no longer use an argument against the Creator in Adam's case, which may now 
recoil on your own God: either that he was ignorant, and had no foresight to 
hinder the future sinner; or that he was unable to hinder him, even if he was 
ignorant; or else that he was unwilling, even if he had the foreknowledge and 
the ability; and so deserved the stigma of maliciousness, in having permitted 
the man of his own choice to perish in his sin. I advise you therefore 
(willingly) to acknowledge the Creator in that god of yours, rather than against 
your will to be assimilating your excellent god to Him. For in the case of 
Peter, too, he gives you proof that he is a jealous God, when he destined the 
apostle, after his presumptuous protestations of zeal, to a flat denial of him, 
rather than prevent his fall. The Christ of the prophets was destined, moreover, 
to be betrayed with a kiss, for He was the Son indeed of Him who was "honoured 
with the lips" by the people. When led before the council, He is asked whether 
He is the Christ. Of what Christ could the Jews have inquired but their own? 
Why, therefore, did He not, even at that moment, declare to them the rival 
(Christ)? You reply, In order that He might be able to suffer. In other words, 
that this most excellent god might plunge men into crime, whom he was still 
keeping in ignorance. But even if he had told them, he would yet have to suffer. 
For he said, "If I tell you, ye will not believe." And refusing to believe, they 
would have continued to insist on his death. And would he not even more probably 
still have had to suffer, if had announced himself as sent by the rival god, and 
as being, therefore, the enemy of the Creator? It was not, then, in order that 
He might suffer, that He at that critical moment refrained from proclaiming 
Himself the other Christ, but because they wanted to extort a confession from 
His mouth, which they did not mean to believe even if He had given it to them, 
whereas it was their bounden duty to have acknowledged Him in consequence of His 
works, which were fulfilling their Scriptures. It was thus plainly His course to 
keep Himself at that moment unrevealed, because a spontaneous recognition was 
due to Him. But yet for all this, He with a solemn gesture says, "Hereafter 
shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God." For it was on 
the authority of the prophecy of Daniel that He intimated to them that He was 
"the Son of man," and of David's Psalm, that He would "sit at the right hand of 
God." Accordingly, after He had said this, and so suggested a comparison of the 
Scripture, a ray of light did seem to show them whom He would have them 
understand Him to be; for they say: "Art thou then the Son of God?" 
Of what God, but of Him whom alone they knew? Of what God but of Him whom 
they remembered in the Psalm as having said to 
His Son, "Sit Thou on my right hand?" Then He answered, "Ye say that I am;" 
as if He meant: It is ye who say this--not I. But at the same time He allowed 
Himself to be all that they had said, in this their second question. By what 
means, however, are you going to prove to us that they pronounced the sentence 
"Ergo tu fulius Dei es" inter-rogatively, and not affirmatively? Just as, (on 
the one hand,) because He had shown them in an indirect manner, by passages of 
Scripture, that they ought to regard Him as the Son of God, they therefore meant 
their own words, "Thou art then the Son of God," to be taken in a like 
(indirect) sense, as much as to say, "You do not wish to say this of yourself 
plainly, so, (on the other hand,) He likewise answered them, "Ye say that I am," 
in a sense equally free from doubt, even affirmatively; and so completely was 
His statement to this effect, that they insisted on accepting that sense which 
His statement indicated. 
CHAP. XLII.--OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE PASSION MINUTELY COMPARED WITH 
PROPHECY. PILATE AND HEROD. BARABBAS PREFERRED TO JESUS. DETAILS OF THE 
CRUCIFIXION. THE EARTHQUAKE AND THE MID-DAY DARKNESS. ALL WONDERFULLY 
FORETOLD IN THE SCRIPTURES OF THE CREATOR. CHRIST'S GIVING UP THE GHOST 
NO EVIDENCE OF
MARCION'S DOCETIC OPINIONS. IN HIS SEPULTURE THERE IS A REFUTATION 
THEREOF.
For when He was brought before Pilate, they proceeded to urge Him with the 
serious charge, of declaring Himself to be Christ the King; that is, 
undoubtedly, as the Son of God, who was to sit at God's right hand. They would, 
however, have burdened Him with some other title, if they had been uncertain 
whether He had called Himself the Son of God--if He had not pronounced the 
words, "Ye say that I am," so as (to admit) that He was that which they said He 
was. Likewise, when Pirate asked Him, "Art thou Christ (the King)?" He answered, 
as He had before (to the Jewish council) "Thou sayest that I am" in order that 
He might not seem to have been driven by a fear of his power to give him a 
fuller answer. "And so the Lord i hath stood on His trial." And he placed His 
people on their trial. The Lord Himself comes to a trial with "the elders and 
rulers of the people," as Isaiah predicted. And then He fulfilled all that had 
been written of His passion. At that time "the heathen raged, and the people 
imagined vain things; the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers 
gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ." The 
heathen were Pilate and the Romans; the people were the tribes of Israel; the 
kings were represented in Herod, and the rulers in the chief priests. When, 
indeed, He was sent to Herod gratuitously by Pilate, the words of Hosea were 
accomplished, for he had prophesied of Christ: "And they shall carry Him bound 
as a present to the king." Herod was "exceeding glad" when he saw Jesus, but he 
heard not a word from Him. For, "as a lamb before the shearer is dumb, so He 
opened not His mouth," because "the Lord had given to Him a disciplined tongue, 
that he might know how and when it behoved Him to speak"--even that "tongue 
which clove to His jaws," as the Psalm said it should, through His not speaking. 
Then Barabbas, the most abandoned criminal, is released, as if he were the 
innocent man; while the most righteous Christ is delivered to be put to death, 
as if he were the murderer. Moreover two malefactors are crucified around Him, 
in order that He might Le reckoned amongst the transgressors. Although His 
raiment was, without doubt, parted among the soldiers, and partly distributed by 
lot, yet Marcion has erased it all (from his Gospel), for he had his eye upon 
the Psalm: "They parted my garments amongst them, and cast lots upon my 
vesture." You may as well take away the cross itself! But even then the Psalm is 
not silent concerning it: "They pierced my hands and my feet." Indeed, the 
details of the whole event are therein read: "Dogs compassed me about; 
the assembly of the wicked enclosed me around. All that looked upon me 
laughed me to scorn; they did shoot out their lips and shake their heads, 
(saying,) He hoped in God, let Him deliver Him." Of what use now is (your 
tampering with) the testimony of His garments? If you take it as a booty for 
your false Christ, still all the Psalm (compensates) the vesture of Christ. But, 
behold, the very elements are shaken. For their Lord was suffering. If, however, 
it was their enemy to whom all this injury was done, the heaven would have 
gleamed with light, the sun would have been even more radiant, and the day would 
have prolonged its course--gladly gazing at Marcion's Christ suspended on his 
gibbet! These proofs would still have been suitable for me, even if they had not 
been the subject of prophecy. Isaiah says: "I will clothe the heavens with 
blackness." This will be the day, concerning which Amos also writes: And it 
shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that the sun shall go down at 
noon and the earth shall be dark in the clear day." (At noon) the veil of. the 
temple was rent" by the escape of the cherubim, which "left the daughter of Sion 
as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers." With what 
constancy has He also, in Psalm xxx., laboured to present to us the very Christ! 
He calls with a loud voice to the Father, "Into Thine hands I commend my 
spirit," that even when dying He might expend His last breath in fulfilling the 
prophets. Having said this, He gave up the ghost." Who? Did the spirit give 
itself up; or the flesh the spirit? But the spirit could not have breathed 
itself out. That which breathes is one thing, that which is breathed is another. 
If the spirit is breathed it must needs be breathed by another. If, however, 
there had been nothing there but spirit, it would be said to have departed 
rather than expired. What, however, breathes out spirit but the flesh, which 
both breathes the spirit whilst it has it, and breathes it out when it loses it? 
Indeed, if it was not flesh (upon the cross), but a phantom of flesh (and a 
phantom is but spirit, and so the spirit breathed its own self out, and departed 
as it did so), no doubt the phantom departed, when the spirit which was the 
phantom departed: and so the phantom and the spirit disappeared together, and 
were nowhere to be seen. Nothing therefore remained upon the cross, nothing hung 
there, after "the giving up of the ghost;" there was nothing to beg of Pilate, 
nothing to take down from the cross, nothing to wrap in the linen, nothing to 
lay in the new sepulchre. Still it was not nothing that was there. What was 
there, then? If a phantom Christ was yet there. If Christ had departed, He had 
taken away the phantom also. The only shift left to the impudence of the 
heretics, is to admit that what remained there was the phantom of a phantom! But 
what if Joseph knew that it was a body which he treated with so much piety? That 
same Joseph "who had not consented" with the Jews in their crime? The "happy man 
who walked not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, 
nor sat in the seat of the scornful." 
CHAP. XLIII.--CONCLUSIONS.JESUS AS THE CHRIST OF THE CREATOR PROVED FROM 
THE EVENTS OF THE LAST CHAPTER OF ST. LUKE. THE PIOUS WOMEN AT THE SEPULCHRE. 
THE ANGELS AT THE RESURRECTION. THE MANIFOLD APPEARANCES OF CHRIST AFTER THE 
RESURRECTION. HIS MISSION OF THE APOSTLES AMONGST ALL NATIONS. ALL SHOWN TO BE 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WISDOM OF THE ALMIGHTY FATHER, AS INDICATED IN PROPHECY. 
THE BODY OF CHRIST AFTER DEATH NO MERE PHANTOM. MARCION'S MANIPULATION OF 
THE GOSPEL ON THIS POINT.
It was very meet that the man who buried the Lord should thus be noticed in 
prophecy, and thenceforth be "blessed;" since prophecy does not omit the (pious) 
office of the women who resorted before day-break to the sepulchre with the 
spices which they had pre 
pared. For of this incident it is said by Hosea: "To seek my face they will 
watch tiIl day-light, saying unto me, Come, and let us return to the Lord: for 
He hath taken away, and He will heal us; He hath smitten, and He will bind us 
up; after two days will He revive us: in the third day He will raise us up." For 
who can refuse to believe that these words often revolved in the thought of 
those women between the sorrow of that desertion with which at present they 
seemed to themselves to have been smitten by the Lord, and the hope of the 
resurrection itself, by which they rightly supposed that all would be restored 
to them? But when "they found not the body (of the Lord Jesus)," "His sepulture 
was removed from the midst of them," according to the prophecy of Isaiah. "Two 
angels however, appeared there." For just so many honorary companions were 
required by the word of God, which usually prescribes "two witnesses." Moreover, 
the women, returning from the sepulchre, and from this vision of the angels, 
were foreseen by Isaiah, when he says, "Come, ye women, who return from the 
vision;" that is, "come," to report the resurrection of the Lord. It was well, 
however, that the unbelief of the disciples was so persistent, in order that to 
the last we might consistently maintain that Jesus revealed Himself to the 
disciples as none other than the Christ of the prophets. For as two of them were 
taking a walk, and when the Lord had joined their company, without its appearing 
that it was He, and whilst He dissembled His knowledge of what had just taken 
place, they say: "But we trusted that it had been He which should have redeemed 
Israel,"--meaning their own, that is, the Creator's Christ. So far had He been 
from declaring Himself to them as another Christ! They could not, however, deem 
Him to be the Christ of the Creator; nor, if He was so deemed by them, could He 
have tolerated this opinion concerning Himself, unless He were really He whom He 
was supposed to be. Otherwise He would actually be the author of error, and the 
prevaricator of truth, contrary to the character of the good; God. But at no 
time even after His resurrection did He reveal Himself to them as any other than 
what, on their own showing, they had always thought Him to be. He pointedly 
reproached them: "O fools, and slow of heart in not believing that which He 
spake unto you." By saying this, He proves that He does not belong to the rival 
god, but to the same God. For the same thing was said by the angels to the 
women: "Remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The 
Son of man must be delivered up, and be crucified, and on the third day rise 
again." "Must be delivered up; "and why, except that it was so written by God 
the Creator? He therefore upbraided them, because they were offended solely at 
His passion, and because they doubted of the truth of the resurrection which had 
been reported to them by the women, whereby (they showed that) they had not 
believed Him to have been the very same as they had thought Him to be. Wishing, 
therefore, to be believed by them in this wise, He declared Himself to be just 
what they had deemed Him to be--the Creator's Christ, the Redeemer of lsrael. 
But as touching the reality of His body, what can be plainer? When they were 
doubting whether He were not a phantom--nay, were supposing that He was one--He 
says to them, "Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? 
See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; for a spirit hath not bones, as 
ye see me have." Now Marcion was unwilling to expunge from his Gospel some 
statements which even made against him--I suspect, on purpose, to have it in his 
power from the passages which he did not suppress, when he could have done so, 
either to deny that he had expunged anything, or else to justify his 
suppressions, if he made any. But he spares only such passages as he can subvert 
quite as well by explaining them away as by expunging them from the text. Thus, 
in the passage before us, he would have the words, "A spirit hath not bones, as 
ye see me have," so transposed, as to mean, "A spirit, such as ye see me to be, 
hath not bones;" that is to say, it is not the nature of a spirit to have bones. 
But what need of so tortuous a construction, when He might have simply said, "A 
spirit hath not bones, even as you observe that I have not?" Why, moreover, does 
He offer His hands and His feet for their examination--limbs which consist of 
bones--if He had no bones? Why, too, does He add, "Know that 
it is I myself," when they had before known Him to be corporeal? Else, if He 
were altogether a phantom, why did He upbraid them for supposing Him to be a 
phantom? But whilst they still believed not, He asked them for some meat, for 
the express purpose of showing them that He had teeth. 
And now, as I would venture to believe, we have accomplished our undertaking. 
We have set forth Jesus Christ as none other than the Christ of the Creator. Our 
proofs we have drawn from His doctrines, maxims, affections, feelings, miracles, 
sufferings, and even resurrection--as foretold by the prophets. Even to the last 
He taught us (the same truth of His mission), when He sent forth His apostles to 
preach His gospel "among all nations;" for He thus fulfilled the psalm: "Their 
sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the 
world." Marcion, I pity you; your labour has been in vain. For the Jesus Christ 
who appears in your Gospel is mine. 
DR. HOLMES' NOTE
Dr. Holmes appends the following as a note to the Fourth Book. (See cap. vi. 
p 351.) The following statement, abridged from Dr. Lardner (The History of 
Heretics, chap. x. sees. 35-40), may be useful to the reader, in reference to 
the subject of the preceding Book:--Marcion received but eleven books of the New 
Testament, and these strangely curtailed and altered. He divided them into two 
parts, which he called to Euaggelion (the Gospel) and to 
Apostolikon (the Apostolicon). 
The former contained nothing more than a mutilated, and sometimes 
interpolated, edition of ST. LUKE; the name of that evangelist, however, he 
expunged from the beginning of his copy. Chaps. i. and ii. he rejected entirely, 
and began at iii. 1, reading the opening verse thus: "In the xv. year of 
Tiberius Caesar, God descended into Capernaum, a city of Galilee." 
According to Irenaeus, Epiphanius, and Theodoret, he rejected the genealogy 
and baptism of Christ; whilst from Tertullian's statement (chap. 
vii.) it seems likely that he connected what part of chap. iii.--vers. 1, 
2--he chose to retain, with chap. iv. 31, at a leap. 
. He further eliminated the history of the tempation. That part of chap. iv. 
which narrates Christ's going into the synagogue at Nazareth and reading out of 
Isaiah he also rejected, and all afterwards to the end of yet. 
Epiphanius mentions sundry slight alterations in capp. v. 14, 24, vi. 
5, 17. In chap. viii. 19 he expunged h mhthr autos, 
kai adelfoi autou. From Tertullian's remarks (chap. xix.), 
it would seem at first as if Marcion had added to his Gospel that answer of our 
Saviour which we find related by St. Matthew, chap. xii. 48: "Who is my mother, 
and who are my brethren?" For he represents Marcion (as in De came Christ, vii., 
he represents other heretics, who deny the nativity) as making use of these 
words for his favourite argument. But, after all, Marcion might use these words 
against those who allowed the authenticity of Matthew's Gospel, without 
inserting them in his own Gospel; or else Tertullian might quote from memory, 
and think that to be in Luke which was only in Matthew--as he has done at least 
in three instances. (Lardner refers two of these instances to passages in chap. 
vii. of this Book iv., where Tertullian mentions, as erasures from Luke, what 
really are found in Matthew v. 17 and xv. 24. The third instance referred to by 
Lardner probably occurs at the end of chap. ix. of this same Book iv., where 
Tertullian 
again mistakes Matt. v. 17 for a passage of Luke, and charges Marcion with 
expunging it; curiously enough, the mistake recurs in chap. xii. of the same 
Book.) In Luke x. 21 Marcion omitted the first pater and the words 
kai ths ghs, that he might not allow Christ to call His 
Father the Lord of earth, or of this world. The second pathr in this 
verse, not open to any inconvenience, he retained. In chap. xi. 29 he omitted 
the last words concerning the sign of the prophet Jonah; he also omitted all the 
30th, 31st, and 32d verses; in ver. 42 he read kghsin, 'calling,' instead 
of emprosqen twn aggegmn tou Qeou 'judgment.' 
He rejected verses 49, 50, 51, because the passage related to the prophets. He 
entirely omitted chap. xii. 6; whilst in ver. 8 he read emprosqen
tou Qeou instead of emprosqen twn aggelwn
tou Qeou. He seems to have left out all the 28th verse, and 
expunged umwn from verses 30 and 32, reading only o pathr. 
In ver. 38, instead of the words en th deutera
Fugakh, kai eh trith Fulakh, he read 
en th esperinh Fulakh. In chap. xiii. he omitted the 
first five verses, whilst in the 28th verse of the same chapter, where we read, 
"When ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the 
kingdom of God, and ye yourselves thrust out," he read (by altering, adding, and 
transposing), "When ye shall see all the just in the kingdom of God, and you 
yourselves cast out, and bound without, there shall be weeping and gnashing of 
teeth." He likewise excluded all the remaining verses of this chapter. All chap. 
xv. after the 10th verse, in which is contained the parable of the prodigal son, 
he eliminated from his Gospel. In xvii. 10 he left out all the words after 
legete. He made many alterations in the story of the ten lepers; he left 
out part of ver. 12, all yet. 13, and altered vet. 14, reading thus: "There met 
Him ten lepers; and He sent them away, saying, Show yourselves to the priest;" 
after which he inserted a clause from chap. iv. 27: "There were many lepers in 
the days of Eliseus the prophet, but none of them were cleansed, but Naaman the 
Syrian." In chap. xviii. 19 he added the words o pathr, and in 
ver. 20 altered oidas, thou knowest, into the first person. He entirely 
omitted verses 31-33, in which our blessed Saviour declares that the things 
foretold by the prophets concerning His sufferings, and death, and resurrection, 
should all be fulfilled. He expunged nineteen verses out of chap. xix., from the 
end of yet. 27 to the beginning of ver. 47. In chap. xx. he omitted ten verses, 
from the end of ver. 8 to the end of ver. 18. He rejected also verses 37 and 38, 
in which there is a reference to Moses. Marcion also erased of chap. xxi. the 
first eighteen verses, as well as verses 21 and 22, on account of this clause, 
"that all things which are written may be fulfilled;" xx. 16 was left out by 
him, so also verses 35-37, 50, and 51 (and, adds Lardner, conjecturally, not 
herein following his authority Epiphanius, also vers. 38 and 49). In chap. 
xxiii. 2, after the words "perverting the nation," Marcion added, "and 
destroying the law and the prophets;" and again, after "forbidding to give 
tribute unto Caesar," he added, "and perverting women and children." He also 
erased ver. 43. In chap. xxiv. he omitted that part of the conference between 
our Saviour and the two disciples going to Emmaus, which related to the 
prediction of His sufferings, and which is contained in verses 26 and 27. These 
two verses he omitted, and changed the words at the end of ver. 25, 
egaghsan oi proQhtai, into egaghsa uhin. Such 
are the alterations, according to Epiphanius, which Marcion made in his Gospel 
from St. Luke. Tertullian says (in the 4th chapter of the preceding Book) that 
Marcion erased the passage which gives an account of the parting of the raiment 
of our Saviour among the soldiers. But the reason he assigns for the 
erasure--'respiciens Psalmi prophetiam'--shows that in this, as well as in the 
few other instances which we have already named, where Tertullian has charged 
Marcion with so altering passages, his memory deceived him into mistaking 
Matthew for Luke, for the reference to the passage in the Psalm is only given by 
St. Matthew xxvii. 
On an impartial review of these alterations, some seem to be but slight; 
others might be nothing but various readings; but others, again, are undoubtedly 
designed perver 
sions. There were, however, passages enough left unaltered and unexpunged by 
the Marcionites, to establish the reality of the flesh and blood of Christ, and 
to prove that the God of the Jews was the Father of Christ, and of perfect 
goodness as well as justice. Tertullian, indeed, observes (chap. xliii.) that 
"Marcion purposely avoided erasing all the passages which made against him, that 
he might with the greater confidence deny having erased any at all, or at least 
that what he had omitted was for very good reasons." 
To show the unauthorized and unwarrantable character of these alterations, 
omissions, additions, and corruptions, the Catholic Christians asserted that 
their copies of St. Luke's Gospel were more ancient than Marcion's (so 
Tertullian in chap. iii. and iv. of this Book iv.); and they maintained also the 
genuineness and integrity of the unadulterated Gospel, in opposition to that 
which had been curtailed and altered by him (chap. v.).
