PaulÂ’s Letter to the Colossians 

1:1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through 
the will of God, and Timothy our brother, 1:2to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at 
Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

1:3We give thanks to God the Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, 1:4having heard of your 
faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints, 1:5because of the hope which is laid up for 
you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the 
Gospel, 1:6which has come to you; even as it is in 
all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since 
the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth; 1:7even as you learned 
of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on 
our behalf, 1:8who also declared to us your love in the 
Spirit. 1:9For this cause, we also, since the day 
we heard this, don't cease praying and making requests for you, that you may be 
filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, 
1:10that you may walk worthily of the Lord, 
to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing 
in the knowledge of God; 1:11strengthened with all power, according 
to the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy; 1:12giving thanks to the Father, who made 
us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; 1:13who delivered us out of the power of 
darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love; 1:14in 
whom we have our redemption,* the 
forgiveness of our sins; 1:15who is the image of the invisible God, 
the firstborn of all creation. 1:16For by him were all things created, in 
the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether 
thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created 
through him, and for him. 1:17He is before all things, and in him all 
things are held together. 1:18He is the head of the body, the 
assembly, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things 
he might have the preeminence. 1:19For all the fullness was pleased to 
dwell in him; 1:20and through him to reconcile all things 
to himself, by him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens, 
having made peace through the blood of his cross. 
1:21You, being in past times alienated and 
enemies in your mind in your evil works, 1:22yet now he has reconciled in the body 
of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and 
blameless before him, 1:23if it is so that you continue in the 
faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the Gospel 
which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven; of 
which I, Paul, was made a servant. 
1:24Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your 
sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ 
in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the assembly; 1:25of which I was made 
a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you, to 
fulfill the word of God, 1:26the mystery which has been hidden for 
ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his saints, 1:27to 
whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this 
mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory; 1:28whom we proclaim, admonishing every man 
and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in 
Christ Jesus; 1:29for which I also labor, striving 
according to his working, which works in me mightily. 
2:1For I desire to have you know how 
greatly I struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have 
not seen my face in the flesh; 2:2that their hearts may be comforted, they 
being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of 
understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, both of the Father and of 
Christ, 2:3in whom are all the treasures of wisdom 
and knowledge hidden. 2:4Now this I say that no one may delude 
you with persuasiveness of speech. 2:5For though I am absent in the flesh, yet 
am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the 
steadfastness of your faith in Christ. 2:6As therefore you received Christ Jesus, 
the Lord, walk in him, 2:7rooted and built up in him, and 
established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in 
thanksgiving. 2:8Be careful that you don't let anyone rob 
you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after 
the elements of the world, and not after Christ. 2:9For in him all the 
fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, 2:10and in him you are made full, who is 
the head of all principality and power; 2:11in whom you were also circumcised with 
a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins 
of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ; 2:12having been buried 
with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the 
working of God, who raised him from the dead. 2:13You were dead 
through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. He made you alive 
together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, 2:14wiping out the 
handwriting in ordinances which was against us; and he has taken it out of the 
way, nailing it to the cross; 2:15having stripped the principalities and 
the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. 
2:16Let no man therefore judge you in 
eating, or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a 
Sabbath day, 2:17which are a shadow of the things to 
come; but the body is Christ's. 2:18Let no one rob you of your prize by a 
voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which 
he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, 2:19and not holding 
firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together 
through the joints and ligaments, grows with God's growth. 2:20If you died with 
Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, do 
you subject yourselves to ordinances, 2:21"Don't handle, nor taste, nor touch" 2:22(all of which perish with use), 
according to the precepts and doctrines of men? 2:23Which things indeed 
appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, and humility, and severity to the 
body; but aren't of any value against the indulgence of the flesh. 
3:1If then you were raised together with 
Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right 
hand of God. 3:2Set your mind on the things that are 
above, not on the things that are on the earth. 3:3For you died, and 
your life is hidden with Christ in God. 3:4When Christ, our life, is revealed, then 
you will also be revealed with him in glory. 3:5Put to death 
therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, 
depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry; 3:6for 
which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience. 3:7You 
also once walked in those, when you lived in them; 3:8but now you also put 
them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your 
mouth. 3:9Don't lie to one another, seeing that 
you have put off the old man with his doings, 3:10and have put on the 
new man, that is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator, 3:11where there can't be Greek and Jew, 
circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but 
Christ is all, and in all. 
3:12Put on therefore, as God's chosen ones, 
holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and 
perseverance; 3:13bearing with one another, and forgiving 
each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, 
so you also do. 
3:14Above all these things, walk in love, 
which is the bond of perfection. 3:15And let the peace of God rule in your 
hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. 3:16Let the word of Christ dwell in you 
richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, 
and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord. 
3:17Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do 
all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him. 

3:18Wives, be in subjection to your 
husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 
3:19Husbands, love your wives, and don't be 
bitter against them. 
3:20Children, obey your parents in all 
things, for this pleases the Lord. 
3:21Fathers, don't provoke your children, 
so that they won't be discouraged. 
3:22Servants, obey in all things those who 
are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as 
men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God. 3:23And whatever you 
do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men, 3:24knowing that from 
the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord 
Christ. 3:25But he who does wrong will receive 
again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality. 
4:1Masters, give to your servants that 
which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven. 
4:2Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching 
therein with thanksgiving; 4:3praying together for us also, that God 
may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I 
am also in bonds; 4:4that I may reveal it as I ought to 
speak. 4:5Walk in wisdom toward those who are 
outside, redeeming the time. 4:6Let your speech always be with grace, 
seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one. 
4:7All my affairs will be made known to you 
by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant in 
the Lord. 4:8I am sending him to you for this very 
purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts, 4:9together with Onesimus, the faithful and 
beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you everything that 
is going on here. 4:10Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner greets 
you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received 
commandments, "if he comes to you, receive him"), 4:11and Jesus who is 
called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These are my only fellow workers for 
the Kingdom of God, men who have been a comfort to me. 
4:12Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant 
of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may 
stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. 4:13For I testify about 
him, that he has great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in 
Hierapolis. 4:14Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas 
greet you. 4:15Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, 
and Nymphas, and the assembly that is in his house. 4:16When this letter 
has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the 
Laodiceans; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea. 4:17Tell Archippus, 
"Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill 
it." 
4:18The salutation of me, Paul, with my own 
hand: remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
