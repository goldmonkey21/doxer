Thanks   That's why i invested to IOTA while prices are low. For traders we only bother one thing: Buy low and sell high. My advice is buy IOTA and forgot it for 3-4 years. Investing is only about time and value.. 2 months ago price of Radium is lower than 2.5$..Under efficient market conditions price should be at least 10$. But there are so much risks involved on altcoin investing options.  Of course every investor should choose and analyze ICO bfeore investing. Dont get fooled by number of investors or raised funds on token sale pages of projects because they can change details on site to attract new investors Dont expect new correction wave before price hit 5000$ level. Maybe strong resistance levels can cause few panic selling but price is already on uptrend. IMO it shouldnt be a problem for site administration unless you refuse to show the link of site as resource. Can you explain the details of this trade? What is your conditions? It is a bit hard to make such decision because of volatile prices on altcoin market. If you want to invest on some altcoin you should use your own analyse on sites like  coinmarketcap  and check which altcoin can give you better ROI. In 5 years bitcoin price will be more than 15000BTC/usd rate P.S: For donations please use this address: 16HSpRGnEVqpojzKXcovi4kbjzy8RcmJPs How to mine this coin?

Bitcoin Price Report for December 30, 201612/30/2016 0 COMMENTS Market Commentary:Rationality is finally returning to the market following a rather manic period of buying over the course of the past week.  After failing to break back above the 970 $ level yesterday, sellers began to move into the market to drive prices down in classic bull market fashion before finding a bottom at near term support where buyers reemerged.  Now that price is back around the 950 $ level on relatively mixed technicals conditions going into yet another long holiday weekend, we still think that caution is warranted for the time being despite our VST ProTrade long entry trigger at [members-only text] overnight.  We will remain in this position for the next handful of days if need be, but will also be working with a stop closer to [members-only text] considering we have already seen a decent move off of the local lows.Today we take another look at the 6-hour chart due to the fact that we think it gives is the best view of the short to medium term technical picture.  We can see that price currently seems to be mimicking the pullback from last week which was precipitated by a bearish pivot on overbought and divergent momentum, and was also stopped by trendline and historical support.  Also note that despite the recent [members-only text] and somewhat [members-only text] market structure, SCMR has not painted any [members-only text] candles yet and in fact is already trying to shift back to [members-only text].  Additionally, dynamic support continues to build around the key [members-only text] level while the near term uptrend line and an area of resistance turned support both provide a good spot to shoot against for new scalp longs.  Moving on to momentum and volume and it becomes clear that we have not yet had a [members-only text], however the selloff so far as been a good start.  Notice that Willy and the Stochastic are just now coming down out of officially overbought territory while RSI continues to try to work off its bearish divergence, plus MACD has crossed back below its zeroline and PPO continues to flash strong sell signals.  Conversely, the EMA's remain bullish, the SMA's are supportive and still confirming [members-only text], the A/D line continues to trend higher, and exchange volumes have not yet sent a clear sell signal.While we cannot rule out the possibility of a continuation to the downside prior to a resumption of the push to new highs, we think it will present an even more attractive long entry opportunity in the critical [members-only text] area.  We would be unequivocal buyers of such a move, even though it would mean [members-only text], due to the fact that risk/reward would be quite attractive down at those levels.  On the other hand, there is also a decent chance that what we saw overnight was it in terms of the pullback and we simply tread water until the indicators are recharged early next week.  Either way, we feel prepared for what the market might throw at us this weekend, the final one of 2016.Posted ProTrade Ideas:1a.) **Bitcoin ProTrade - Very Short Term [UPDATED on 12/30/2016]**:  We will consider a [members-only text] position in the [members-only text] area with a stop around [members-only text] and a target of [members-only text].1b.) **Bitcoin ProTrade - Very Short Term [ACTIVE; ENTERED on 12/30/2016]**:  We will stay [members-only text] off of the [members-only text] level with a stop around [members-only text] and a target of [members-only text].2.) **Bitcoin ProTrade - Short Term [UPDATED on 12/30/2016]**:  We will consider a [members-only text] position in the [members-only text] area with a stop around [members-only text] and a target of [members-only text].3.) **Bitcoin ProTrade - Medium Term [UPDATED on 12/30/2016]**:  We will consider a [members-only text] on a move to the [members-only text] area with a stop around [members-only text] and a target of [members-only text].4.) **Bitcoin ProTrade - Long Term [ACTIVE; UPDATED on 12/28/2016]**:  We will stay [members-only text] off of the [members-only text] level with a stop around [members-only text] and a target of [members-only text].  We will add to the position in the [members-only text] area.**Premium members get to see live trades complete forecasts, and full charts everyday.To get your access to our edge, subscribe today.** Here is the latest performance review versus buy & hold.

This could materialize in one of two ways in our opinion: 1.)  The market stays stagnant in the 630 - 640 $ range while all timeframes align on oversold conditions, or 2.) we take a jaunt to the downside to test the 600 $ area to truly reset momentum and washout weak hands.Today we are taking a look at the 12-hour chart below, which we mentioned already in terms of needing more of an indicator correction than what has occurred so far.  Notice that what was fairly bullish near term market structure yesterday has morphed into bearish market structure today on this timeframe, not to mention the fact that volume profile remains porous between 600 and 625 $ and total exchange volumes are relatively swift and bearish.  Also, the near term EMA's are about to cross over to the downside while the 200-period SMA continues to flatline, both of which tell us that conviction is low on either side of the market.Moving on to the more bullish indications, we can see that there is still a working near term uptrend line now sitting around 625 $ that is being tested.  Additionally, RSI is already almost back to the 50-line, Willy is finally coming down out of officially overbought territory, PPO has gone from flashing major sell signals to minor ones, and MACD remains pinned near the zeroline.  Lastly, if the do bears to begin to get their claws in the market to take it lower there is a significant confluence area in the aforementioned 595 - 615 $ range consisting of strong SCMR support, the 200-period SMA, volume profile PoC, as well as the top of the pivot area and near term OTE long zone, all of which signal that buyers should emerge around there.All things considered, we now think that a (shallow and buyable) dip down into support prior to a breakout over the 642 $ local high is the slightly more likely scenario for the time being.GLGT!bullbearanalytics.com Market Commentary (BTC):  Following the release of our price update yesterday, bitcoin continued to push to the upside reaching a high of 640 $ on the dot.  Despite the need for a pullback the market was simply too bullish, however today we are getting at least a small pause that hopefully refreshes.  As far as fundamentals go, there is still some near term uncertainty with regard to the release of the latest Core update and Roger Ver's new mining pool ViaBTC which is attempting to block SegWit.  Having said that, we think this is a passing threat which leaves the medium to long term fundamentals conducive to a sustained rally higher over the next few years.  For the technical perspective, let's take a look at the 6-hour chart below.We can see that the near term EMA's are now stacking to the upside while the 200-period SMA continues it's steady journey higher, both of which tell us that the the market remains in rally mode despite the recent pause.  Also notice that there was a small selloff immediately following a breakout failure above 640 $ which was stopped by what is now the new bullish pivot area shown in light blue. Considering price ripped through the OTE short zone like tin foil yesterday, in addition to how well it has held up today, we think there is a pretty good chance at a continuation to the upside once this minor consolidation is completed.Moving on to momentum and volume we can see that the oscillators remain heavily overbought, although we still do not have any bearish divergences to speak of which means the bulls remain in control for the time being.  Also note that PPO is flashing early warning signs as price extends well above the volume profile value area and PoC.  Speaking of volume, A/D line continues its trek higher, getting a boost over the past few days, and the volume breakout from late Monday is still confirming the bullish bias.Almost all of the main indicators that we watch, with the exception of the momentum oscillators, are signaling that a continuation to the upside is the most likely outcome over the course of the remainder of this week.  That said, the current mini-consolidation is not yet over so we might have to be patient and neutral over the next few days in order to let the market settle into a new local bottoming area.  GLGT!   bullbearanalytics.com Market Commentary (BTC): Bitcoin Price Update for October 6, 2016  Given that bitcoin is STILL trapped under 610 $ this morning and remains inside the daily symmetrical triangle formation that we showed in yesterday's update, today we want to focus on the short term for clues as to where we might be headed over the weekend.  It is clear on said daily chart that a move is coming considering price is getting squeezed between the triangle downtrend line and SCMR dynamic support.  Any move to the upside will break the formation, and conversely a failure means a retest of support around 595 $.  Which brings us to the 4-hour chart below which is showing some interesting features related to these key medium-term technical areas.Notice that we had another symmetrical triangle consolidation working on this timeframe for awhile, however this one was broken about a week ago.  We can see that there wasn't much follow-through after the break, although price was able to stay above the apex and is now following the uptrend line higher.  Also note that we still have strong SCMR dynamic support building at the aforementioned 595 $ level, which is around where the OTE long zone and a volume profile notch both sit.  Additionally, the 200-period SMA remains in a supportive uptrend and is now sitting around 605 $ while the near term EMA's try to make a move to the upside.Moving on to the oscillators we can see that Willy and RSI have broken above their centerlines while the Stochastic just gets going to the upside, and PPO is still neutral.  Additionally, trading volumes are picking up, the A/D line is still trending higher, and volume profile looks better than it has it quite a long time complete with very thin air above 615 $.  Finally, we have OTE zones at 595 - 600 $, as well as between 615 - 620 $, so even if we do get a minor breakout from this 600 - 610 $ range this weekend we are not expecting a ton of volatility (at least not yet).  All things considered we want to remain in our current positions despite the lack of price action over the course of this week.  We still think there is a good chance that price holds support in the 605 $ area on selloffs while testing slightly higher levels in the previously mentioned OTE short zone between 615 and 620 $.  This is where we will be taking profits on the VST long ProTrade we remain in, profits which we will look to redeploy on a retest of either the 590 - 600 $ area or hopefully down in the ST buy zones if we are lucky.  Despite what could be a relatively volatile weekend compared to what we have been getting recently, we still don't think the market is ready to attempt to break away from this broad and extended consolidation range between 450 - 700 $.  We are getting closer to a resolution, but we are not there yet.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Chart: https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/free-reports/bitcoin-price-report-for-october-3-2016Bitcoin Price Update for October 3, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  Despite a slight pick-up in price action towards the back half of the weekend, it was not nearly as volatile as we expected which has left the market still trapped in the 600 - 610 $ trading range (Stamp).  We did see a brief respite above 610 $ for part of the day on Saturday, however the bulls could not hold it which lead to a minor selloff back down to the 605 $ area.  Now as we open October price remains just under the key 610 $ resistance level, although we are getting less sanguine on the market over the near term due to the fact that the temporary move above 610 $ over the weekend failed to spark any FOMO whatsoever.  This tells us that the market is not yet ready for a legitimate breakout above the 620 - 630 $ range, or even up to it, so we must remain patient for the time being as the market continues to contemplate where to head next.Hopefully the 12-hour chart below can help us glean some insight into where we might be heading next, at least from a short to medium term perspective.  We can see that the symmetrical triangle was broken mildly to the upside over the weekend, however there was practically no follow-through which is not a great sign for the bulls.  Also note that on the breakout SCMR was painting green candles but has once again switched to neutral following a bearish pivot candle from yesterday.  Additionally, price is still pinned below the 200 SMA but above the near term EMA's, we do have some new dynamic support building around the 595 $ level, and the market is now well above the pivot area now.Moving on to momentum and volume, we can see there are still many mixed signals flying around which is an indication of a short term continuation of the choppy, sideways action (although perhaps with a slight bullish bias).  Notice that Willy is once again very close to officially overbought and PPO is flashing minor sell signals, both on relatively flat price action, while RSI and MACD hold their respective centerlines.  Lastly, volume profile remains porous, particularly between 575 $ and 600 $ which is also where the ST OTE long zone sits, while trading volumes and the A/D line both continue to move to the upside.   All things considered we remain firmly in the bull market consolidation camp for the time being given we are still not getting the type and strength of technical indications that we look for to signal an imminent breakout move in one direction or the other.  Momentum and price action are still rather mixed, while market structure and volume seem to be hinting at the previously mentioned bullish bias.  Having said that, we still like the idea of a move to the downside to test support before heading sustainably above the key 630 $ level, although it is hard to say whether or not we get a quick spike up first which is why we are not yet taking off any ProTrades. Speaking of which, for now we will stay in the VST ProTrade off of the 596 $ level with a stop around 600 $, however we will be looking to take it off on the next push to the upside (hopefully in the 615 - 620 $ range).  Conversely, if price starts to break down we will have a quick trigger finger so that we can preserve capital for our more favorable buy zones which have not yet come into play.  On that note, we still think a final washout move back down into the 570 - 590 $ area is more likely than not, at least to recharge the indicators and to put a scare into weak hands prior to the big move up and out of the broad 450 - 700 $ consolidation region.GLGT!
Bitcoin Price Update for September 30, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  As we approach the end of the week, as well as the end of September, bitcoin's price continues to stagnate in the 600 - 610 $ range much the way it has over the past few weeks.  We still think that we get a breakout in one direction or the other-other the next several days, however we are less convinced of an imminent upside break given that we think there is now a greater likelihood of a washout move lower prior to our move up into the 620 - 630 $ resistance area.  Despite this change to the forecast we will stay in the VST ProTrade off of the 596 $ level until the market tells us it is ready to head lower by stopping us out at the new 600 $ stoploss level.  As we have said many times throughout the week, we feel pretty good about our positioning for now regardless of short term directionality.Moving on to the technicals, we can see on the daily chart below that price is still treading water inside the large symmetrical triangle it has been trapped in for months, as well as inside the pivot area that it has been flirting with for weeks. Also note that SCMR is painting neutral candles on what continues to be a contraction of price action, and we still do not have any semblance of strong dynamic support or resistance near current levels.  Adding to the confusion is a flatlined 9/18 EMA cross and a still bullish and rising 200-day SMA, both of which continue to tell the story of an extended bull market consolidation.Getting to momentum and volume, notice that Willy is already approaching oversold territory despite the stable price, RSI is chopping around the 50-line, MACD is at its zero line, and PPO is still neutral. Additionally, trading volumes remains very anemic and volume profile is still showing some rather substantial notches, however the good ole A/D line continues to push steadily to the upside signaling buyers remain in this region.  The mixed nature of the short to medium term technicals is what is giving us pause regarding a breakout rally materializing right from these levels over the next day or two.  We think a minor washout down into the 570 - 590 $ range, which is where the ST OTE long zone, triangle uptrend line, and volume profile all reside, would set the market up nicely going into October.  A quick tag of this area prior to a move above 610 $ would recharge all of the indicators and would create one final touch point in the triangle formation before departing from it altogether. As previously mentioned, despite this slight change in forecast, we want to let the market tell us whether we are right or wrong.  We have raised our stop-loss level on the active VST ProTrade to the 600 $ level so that we can exit with a small gain if necessary.  If not, and our original call for a weekend rally does indeed materialize, then we will already be in the trade so there will be no love lost.  Regardless, our general approach of buying weakness down into the mid to high 500's $ while selling strength up into the 620 - 630 $ area remains the way to play this market in our opinion until we get clearer signs that this consolidation is truly nearing its demise.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Chart: http://imgur.com/VyUK0AzMarket Commentary (BTC):  No surprises this Thursday morning as bitcoin seems to be following our roadmap from earlier in the week, at least so far.  Our hunch was that the market remains flat going into the latter half of the week, but also that volatility would pick up as we moved into the weekend considering the market is simply too constricted right now to remain in this tight 600 - 610 $ trading range.  While it is still tough to get a good read on directionality, we remain in the bull camp for the time being due to the technicals which we will get to below.  Having said that, regardless of which way it breaks over the coming days, we still do not see price extending beyond the 570 $ level to the downside or 630 $ to the upside.  Speaking of technicals, today we show the 4-hour chart for a look at the shorter term setup so that tomorrow we can focus on the daily chart in order to put everything into context.  First of all we can see that price is in yet another symmetrical triangle consolidation, in addition to the ones on the higher timeframes, and is very close to reaching its apex (~ October 1st) which means a breakout move is nearing. Also note that SCMR is painting neutral candles while we chop around between 600 - 610 $, dynamic support and resistance are nonexistent around current levels, and market structure is mixed to say the least.  Moving on to momentum and volume, we can see that the 9/18 EMA cross has almost completely flatlined while the 200 SMA is still tracking withe the triangle uptrend line, both of which now sit just above the near term OTE long zone between 590 - 600 $.  Additionally, the momentum oscillators remain very mixed given that the Stochastic is moving lower while RSI and Willy drift slightly higher, and PPO is neutral once again following slightly overbought conditions earlier in the week.  Finally, trading volumes remain unimpressive and there is still a large volume profile notch between 570 - 590 $, however the A/D line continues to pick up steam to the upside which tells us that buyers are still accumulating rather heavily in this area.For the time being we are sticking with our call for another day or two of sideways action followed by a move out of the triangles to test more substantial support and/or resistance zones.  We continue to suspect that the move will be to the upside considering the longer term charts are becoming more attractive while the A/D line on the nearer term charts continues to rise.  This is good news for our ProTrade longs, although as previously mentioned we would be surprised to see a move beyond the 620 - 630 $ area over the course of the weekend.  If things go the other way, however, we will get stopped at breakeven on the VST trade so that we can preserve capital for redeployment down in one of our longer term buy zones.  All things considered, we still like our positioning going into what should be a relatively volatile weekend regardless of which direction the market decides to head, so for now we will sit tight and stay patient.GLGT! Chart: https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/free-reports/bitcoin-price-report-for-september-28-2016Bitcoin Price Update for September 28, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  Bitcoin just can't seem to get out of the way of this 600 - 610 $ trading range, not for the time being at least.  Despite the fact that we don't yet see the impetus for a significant move in either direction at this time, we do think the technicals are telegraphing at least a minor breakout from the current restrictive trading area.  While we cannot rule out a break to the downside, we think it would be limited to our 570 - 580 $ buy zone.  Conversely, we do think an upside breakout is more likely, but again would be surprised if the bulls can push price up through multiple resistance levels in the 630 - 680 $ area prior to an indicator recharge going into October. Getting to the details of the analysis, we can see on the 12-hour chart below that price is incredibly close to breaking above the symmetrical triangle downtrend line which would resolve us out of the pattern. Notice how price is temporarily suspended between the triangle trendline and the pivot area on neutral SCMR candles and mixed market structure, telling us that there is not much more room to run sideways at this time.  Additionally, SCMR is painting a double confirmed reversal following the cancellation from last weekend, typically a very powerful near term bullish signal, and the near term EMA's are trying to tick up slightly.Moving on to momentum and volume, we can see that the oscillators remain mixed given Willy is moving up towards overbought territory while RSI continues to wander aimlessly around in no man's land, not to mention the fact that PPO is neutral but close to overbought and MACD continues to flirt with the zeroline.  Regarding volume, the A/D line remains in an uptrend while global trading volumes continue to rise, however volume profile still leaves much to be desired considering the notch between 580 and 600 $ as well as how thin things get outside of the value area.As we head into the latter half of the trading week, there are a few things to keep in mind.  First of all, if the bulls can get through futures settlement tomorrow night while keeping price elevated above 600 $ then we will feel pretty good about our ProTrades going into the weekend.  Practically speaking, any noticeable upside movement from here should spark a FOMO rally as we break above the triangle formation, however the previously mentioned 630, 650, and 680 $ levels will all prove very difficult to push through.  Having said that, we still have a tight stop on the VST trade in case things turn south unexpectedly, although we would not view this as such a bad thing either considering it would give us a chance to reload in the more attractive buy zones we have been mentioning for weeks.  Either way, we feel we are well positioned as we progress towards what could be a relatively volatile weekend.GLGT! Market Commentary (BTC):  Bitcoin remains in the 600 - 610 $ range as the dull month of September approaches it's end and the new, more volatile month of October gets underway over the weekend.  While we are not expecting a sudden bout of volatility, we do think it will slowly creep back into the market as we get deeper into the month.  Until then, however, we think price action will remain subdued with the market staying within the 590 - 610 $ range, which is also where the symmetrical triangle trendlines are currently sitting.  As long as we stay in this area there won't be all that much to do on the trading front, although as this range tightens the likelihood of a breakout in either direction inevitably increases.  Speaking of directionality, lets take a look at the 6-hour chart below for a glance at the short to medium term technicals.  As previously mentioned, price is still in the triangle consolidation off of the regional highs, and is also back in the upper half of the pivot zone.  Also notice that SCMR is painting neutral candles once again following what is still an active confirmed upside reversal, and we now have a fairly strong area of dynamic support sitting between 590 - 595 $.  Finally, the near term EMA's are still bullish for the time being, and the 200-period SMA is still pretty flat but is slightly bullish and supportive around 590 $.  This 590 $ level is now crucial considering it is becoming a confluence area which includes the triangle uptrend line, the 200 SMA, and the top of the OTE.Moving on, we can see that the momentum oscillators remain mixed given that RSI and MACD are currently stuck at their centerlines, Willy is chopping around in no man's land (lockstep with price), and PPO is still neutral.  Additionally, trading volumes are picking up while the A/D line continues to push steadily to the upside, although there is also a large volume profile notch down between 575 - 590 $ that still is begging for some attention.  Despite a small technical bias to the upside, we think there are at least a few more days of sideways action.To reiterate what we have been saying for the past few months, we think this period of stagnation remains an extended bull market consolidation which implies an eventual upside breakout above the ~800 $ regional high.  While we are not expecting this move to materialize over the next week, we do think that over the next few we could start to see some progress up and out of this range.  Having said that, there are still a bunch of resistance spiderwebs between 610 - 700 $ that should prove to be difficult to get through which is why we are still relatively cautious for the time being.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Bitcoin Price Update for September 26, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  Bitcoin is back in the 600 - 610 $ range following a short stint in the 590's $ last week.  Despite what looked like favorable conditions for a downside continuation into our longer term ProTrade buy zones, this outcome never materialized as bulls moved in quicker than expected.  Now we are back to playing the waiting game with the market given the near term forecast remains rather uncertain, although we think we are still well positioned currently regardless of where the market heads over the course of this week.  We will stay long in the VST long trade, and will stay ready to catch more substantial dips if they materialize.Despite the fact that it looks like we may be in store for a bit more choppy consolidation, we do think the market is getting ready to make a move in the not too distant future.  Looking at the 12-hour chart below we can see that price remains within the symmetrical triangle that has been active since June, and we are now back above the pivot zone which provided support last week.  Also notice that SCMR has painted a confirmed upside reversal after a cancellation printed over the weekend, and we are finally getting bright green candles once again.  We also have active OTE long and short zones both above and below the market, as well as triangle trendline support and resistance that is closing in on price.Conversely, the momentum oscillators remain rather unimpressive considering Willy and RSI are still chopping around in no man's land while MACD attempts an anemic push over the zeroline.  Additionally, the near term EMA's are still flat, the 200-period SMA is bearish and pushing lower, PPO is no longer showing buy signals, and market structure remains mixed.  Regarding volume things are looking a bit better given total exchange volumes are showing a small buyers breakout overnight and the A/D line continues to push to the upside, although volume profile still looks unattractive seeing as though there remains a large notch sitting just above PoC between 570 - 620 $.  The lower end of this range is still where we want to be longer term buyers, but for the time being it looks like it could be a struggle to get down there, which is why we are adjusting our VST ProTrade slightly to allow for more upside.Generally speaking we remain longer term bulls on bitcoin, perhaps even more so now than a few weeks ago ("longer the base, higher in space"), but as has been the case over the past few months we are still in a waiting period.  We cannot rule out additional spikes into the mid to high-500's $, which is why our other ProTrade long setups remain in effect, however we realize that we may not get another shot down there prior to a breakout above 610 $ so for now we are comfortable holding the VST position above that level.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Bitcoin Price Update for September 23, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  While the bitcoin price remains in the 590 - 600 $ range that we identified yesterday, there have been some interesting developments on the slightly longer term charts that we think are worth noting.  We still think that a final washout down into our VST buy zone is possible, however it is looking less and less likely with each day that goes by in which price is above 590 $.  At this point we are almost ready to start nibbling longs down around current levels in case this thing starts pushing to the upside over the weekend, although we will wait to add more substantial positions until we we get down into the more favorable 570 - 580 $ region.As is typically the case on Friday, we like to take a look at a more medium term chart in order to gain some context going into the weekend.  We can see on the updated daily chart below that price is still inside the symmetrical triangle, and is now below the light blue pivot area.  Additionally, SCMR is still painting primarily red candles, although we do have a potential upside reversal working today, and market structure remains relatively bearish so we want to stay somewhat cautious for the time being. Also notice how price is below the flatlined EMA's while the 200-day SMA continues to push to the upside, now sitting around 545 $, which could cause a squeeze if they continue to converge.  Despite these rather mixed signals, we do see some more bullish evidence which we discuss below.  First of all, the triangle formation is nearing its apex so we know a breakout resolution is coming within the next 4 - 6 weeks and we still prefer the upside.  This preference is due to a number of factors, one of which is a steadily increasing A/D line that has been in an uninterrupted uptrend since June, and another is the fact that the momentum oscillators are bullishly recharging despite little movement to the downside in price.  Also notice that PPO is back to neutral from overbought, MACD is still bullishly divergent, and there is alot of technical confluence, and thus support, between 500 - 580 $.While we are currently not expecting a selloff all the way down to the low-500's $ at this time, we are still hopeful that we get a shot to reload in the slightly lower ST ProTrade buy area between 570 and 580 $. Having said that, we are getting a creeping feeling that we might not get another chance down there before the market tests higher levels once again, which is why we want to try to catch a small long scalp around current levels (much like we did with our previous VST PT).  Generally speaking we think the market is getting close to breaking out of this multi-month consolidation, but there are likely a few more weeks of chop before we get the impulse move we are looking for to catalyze the next leg of the bull market.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Bitcoin Price Update for September 21, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  "It moved!  I think it moved!"  At long last, after 10 days of being trapped in the 600 - 610 $ range, the market is finally moving out of this area to explore other levels.  Due to the fact that there were multiple failed breakouts at 610 $ it made sense to us that the bears would try to take it lower prior to any further upside movement, hence why we rightly took off the VST ProTrade yesterday near the highs and why we are hesitant to re-buy at current levels. Now that we have some fresh powder to deploy when the time comes, we can remain patient for price to come down into the areas that we feel are more attractive from a risk/reward perspective.Having looked at the longer term charts earlier in the week and the short term chart yesterday, today we want to focus on the medium term via the 12-hour chart below.  We can see that price is still inside of the symmetrical triangle, and as expected is now coming down off of the upper trendline.  Speaking of that descending trendline, notice that SCMR dynamic resistance is now painting overhead around 610 $, right where the final breakout failure occurred. SCMR is printing red candles now as well, not a great sign, although price is already in the pivot area so some near term support is now emerging. Additionally, the EMA's are now bearish, as is the 200 SMA, and volume profile could use some action in the 580 - 600 $ area (mainly at the lower end of this range).On the other hand, the momentum oscillators are telling a slightly different tale considering Willy is getting awfully close to officially oversold, RSI is still choppy but is trying to base, and MACD is once again painting a bullish divergence.  Additionally, PPO is now neutral which tells us that this is not a very emotional market, and the A/D line is rolling over but remains at relatively elevated levels.  Given we have a short term OTE long zone right around volume profile PoC between 570 - 575 $, we think this is a more attractive area for a long trade than current levels are.  Such a move would further recharge the indicators, would test SCMR dynamic support, and would allow price to stay within the triangle consolidation thus keeping our forecast for an eventual upside resolution intact.Having said that, if the market decides to selloff a bit more than expected, then the lower OTE long zone and top of the major demand area around 520 $ would likely be the next stop in our opinion, and we would be buyers of that move as well.  Finally, if the bulls are able to take back control then they still have a ton of resistance to get through before FOMO kicks in.  610 $, 630 $, and 650 $ should all prove to be quite a test, so we do not think a powerful move to the upside is in the cards for bitcoin just yet. We will remain patient and neutral for the time being.  Stillllll waiting...GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/free-reports/bitcoin-price-report-for-september-21-2016 Trades from the past week:1) ProTrade closed for profit overnight: 1.)  **Bitcoin ProTrade - Very Short Term [ENTERED @ 596.55 $; CLOSED @ 608.75 for +2.05%]**: We have closed our LONG off of the 596.55 $ level at 608.75 $ for +2.05% profit.2) ProTrade: **DASH ProTrade [ENTERED @ 0.180; CLOSED @ 205 on 9/13/2016for +13.89] - We closed our LONG position off of the 180 level at 205 for a 13.89% profit since our entry on 9/7/2016. Market Commentary (BTC):  Bitcoin simply refuses to budge from this near term 605 - 610 $ trading range which is making us rethink our current ProTrade position off of the 595 $ area.Ideally we would have seen a move up above 610 $ already, at least to test the OTE short zone at slightly higher levels between 615 - 620 $, however the bulls just do not have enough juice to push through all of the sellers that are capping the market around current levels.  While we are not expecting a huge dump to the downside if price does indeed start moving lower, we do think a selloff down into our ST ProTrade buy zone is very possible over the next week or two.  For this reason, plus the technical ones explained below, we are taking off the VST PT long in order to preserve capital for more favorable levels.Given that we have been focused on the medium to long term forecast over the past few days, today we want to revisit the 4-hour chart for a look at the shorter term technicals.  First off, we can see that price is still stuck between supply and demand areas, and is now sitting right on top of the volume profile PoC (a critical level).  Also notice that SCMR painted a bearish pivot candle yesterday for the first time in a few weeks although we are now back to neutral, and dynamic support and resistance both continue to elude the market during this time of stagnation.  Moving on, we see ample evidence that a pullback is becoming more likely the longer we remain in this tight trading range.  Willy is very close to officially overbought despite stagnant price action, RSI continues to chop around in no man's land, the Stochastic is rolling over out of overbought conditions, and PPO is neutral but is almost giving us a sell signal already.  Additionally, price is now below the 100-period SMA while the near term EMA's continue to flatten out, and the A/D line has taken a slight hit to the downside for the first time since early last week.  While we are not seeing anything in the way of immediate sell signals on the charts just yet we do think there is still some work to be done to the downside prior to the upside resolution, therefore we have closed our VST ProTrade long at 608.75 $.  Why?  There is a massive volume profile notch sitting right around where the OTE long zone is currently, and this is also a region where the pivot area and the 200 SMA will both provide additional support (confluence area).  Although it may seem like a substantial dump on this lower timeframe, a move back down into the 580 $ area would barely be noticeable on most of the charts we showed yesterday in the BBB Report.  This is why we feel comfortable waiting for the market to come to us rather than chasing the market higher or risking capital on a risky short with a mediocre risk/return profile.http://bullbearanalytics.com/ Long Term Outlook (UP AS LONG AS 350 $ HOLDS): Fortunately for some and unfortunately for others, the market is back to its stable ways as indecision and distraction continue to weight on the market. A few weeks ago the distraction was Monero, this week it is a bug in the new Ethereum client that sent ETH hash rate and price down substantially overnight. Regardless of what the cause, the technicals have been steadily signaling this type of sideways action for quite some time, and are now starting to resemble other consolidation periods fractally so at least we have a notion of where we are headed, generally speaking. Having said that, we want to make sure we are in tune with the market by taking a look at the long term timeframe today via the monthly chart below. First of all, the rounded bottom at 150 $ and the bullish market structure since then should both be extremely encouraging for longer term bulls. Not only that, but it appears as though we have a working Cup & Handle with support at the uptrend line which is a bullish continuation pattern. Finally, SCMR is painting bright green candles in addition to strong dynamic support at 350 $ meaning that as long as we hold above there then the bulls will remain in control. On the other hand, Willy is getting awfully close to overbought, RSI is pulling back but remains bullish, and MACD is rolling over slightly for the time being. Additionally, volume profile is still rather porous although we are back inside the value area, and the A/D line remains steady despite lackluster price action and low trading volumes over the past few months. All told, the chart is giving mixed signals for the shorter term outlook but remains bullish over the long term. Patience and neutrality will continue to be our defenses for the time being, although we are still buyers of dips down into our ProTrade long zones.https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Bitcoin Price Update for September 16, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  Bitcoin is still within a few pennies of what the price was when we issued our update yesterday, which is pretty incredible considering OKCoin futures settlement occurred overnight last night.  Despite some choppy volatility in those specific futures markets, the other major exchanges took everything in stride to remain within the tight 605 - 610 $ range.  While this may not seem like a big deal as a singular event it does add to the growing pile of evidence that this market is preparing for a move, a move to the upside in our opinion.  Both the technicals and fundamentals a aligning going into this fall which will be a recipe for some big moves over the coming months.Today we take a look at the daily chart for a look at the medium term setup going into the weekend trade.  We can see that price remains in the symmetrical triangle, and is still flatlining just above the bottom of the pivot zone.  Also notice that we are stuck between the 9 and the 18 EMA's, the 200 SMA continues to trend higher, and price is currently still in a volume profile notch area that could use more exploration.  These mixed signals are showing indecision and a lack of conviction on either side of the market so we don't think we are ready for a breakout just yet, although we also don't think it is too far off considering momentum is recharging with little to no reaction in price. Getting to said momentum, we can see on the oscillators that there is still some work to be done to the downside, however they are awfully close to testing support at their respective centerlines.  Willy and RSI are staying fairly flat in the upper half while MACD has already crossed over its zeroline, and PPO is showing some slightly overbought conditions although they are dwindling as we speak.  Additionally, SCMR is still painting neutral candles, new dynamic support and resistance are nowhere to be found, and the A/D line continues to press to the upside despite lackluster exchange volumes and price action over the course of this week.For the time being the market doesn't seem to be giving us any immediate clues that a dump is imminent which is why we are holding strong in the VST ProTrade.  Despite tightening our official stoploss level just a tad, we still think there is a pretty good chance of a retest of the 620 - 630 $ area over the weekend prior to a failure move to the downside into our ST buy zone.  On that note, we also think there is a possibility that we see a move down into the MT PT zone between 480 - 500 $, but we are not counting on it at this point.  Having said that, we think the odds are much more in favor of a spike tag of the 570 - 580 $ area that gets bought up quickly, rather than another grind lower into medium term support.  Price action should be interesting and revealing early next week which is why we will issuing a full BBB report on Monday.GLGT & Have a great weekend! Bitcoin Price Update for September 15, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  Once again we are left with little to talk about in terms of price action in the bitcoin markets given they continue to stagnate in a contracting range which now sits between 605 - 610 $.  While this may be frustrating for shorter term traders, we think it is setting the market up for a much more substantial move as we creep into autumn.  Also, despite a fairly broad range of spot prices on the major BTC exchanges, the majority of them are currently higher than the Stamp price (even BTC-e) which confirms our upside bias for the time being.  Throw in what are some approaching positive fundamentals in the form of SegWit via 0.13.1, Lightning Network developments, and RootStock for smart contracts, and we think the market is getting primed for a test of the upper 600's $ in the not too distant future.Not only are the fundamentals turning slightly more positive over the next few months, but the technicals are also telling us that something is brewing under the surface.  We can see on the 12-hour chart below that while price remains in the large symmetrical triangle consolidation, the failure to breakout did not lead to a major selloff down to the lower ascending trendline.  Also notice that SCMR is still not painting red candles despite some minor price pressure and somewhat bearish near term market structure, and no new dynamic support is building while strong resistance still hangs overhead.Moving on to momentum and volume we can see that Willy is finally coming back down while RSI holds the centerline, MACD is flatlining along with price, and PPO is back to neutral from slightly overbought. Additionally, the 9/18 EMA cross is now neutral as well, and the 200-period SMA remains in an uptrend but will continue to act as near term resistance due to positioning.  As far as volume goes, the A/D line is still steadily climbing to the upside, exchange volumes are falling again, and volume profile remains porous between 580 - 600 $, as well as below 565 $.  While we do not want to read too much into this considering what we see as an emerging bullish setup, it is important to note that a selloff down into our ST ProTrade buy zone is still a definite possibility.  With that said, we still want to remain firm in our VST PT long off of the 596 $ level along with our breakeven stoploss in order to manage risk in this environment.  While we do not want to reload there before unloading our current position, we would be willing to add to the MT PT down in our ST buy zone, so we will be watching this closely as we head into the weekend.  Ideally, price would rally to test the 620 - 630 $ area again which would give us a chance to exit the VST trade, followed by a retracement down into the 570 - 600 $ range going into next week which could then reverse quickly and head up into the mid to high 600's $ (MT OTE short zone) in fairly short order.  This may be asking for a bit too much, however this is the roadmap we are traveling with right now so take it for what its worth.GLGT!Chart: https://twitter.com/BullBearAnalyst/status/776458850979418112 Bitcoin Price Update for September 14, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  Not too much to comment on regarding price action this morning seeing as though the market remains stuck in this 600 - 610 $ near term trading range.  Despite the fact that the charts look pretty good from a shorter term perspective, the longer term technicals are still exhibiting some extended conditions which could use further correcting.  Having said that, we continue to want to be buyers of dips down into our ProTrade zones considering all signs are still pointing to this being a bull market consolidation.Moving on to said charts, today we take a look at the near term setup via the 4-hour below.  We can see that over the past month or so the market has been inclined to be bullish, even though we had a washout last late last weekend.  Notice that price was traversing along an old uptrend line that when broken sent price back down to sub-600 $ levels (albeit only for a brief period), although this was to be expected given momentum was overbought and divergent.  Also notice that SCMR is trying desperately to paint a confirmed upside reversal following last weekend's dump, but has yet to do so while candles continue to come in mixed and neutral.As far as momentum and volume are concerned, we are still getting mixed signals from many different indicators which is a sign to us that the market is not ready to breakout or breakdown just yet.  We can see that Willy and RSI are in much healthier positions than they were in last week, however they still have some room to run to the downside.  Additionally, PPO remains bullish for the time being although the Stochastic is already almost officially overbought, and the 9/18 EMA cross looks to be bottoming while the 200 SMA remains in an uptrend following a reversal to the upside.  Finally, the A/D line somehow continues to press higher despite the recent choppy conditions and mixed trading volumes which tells us that players are still accumulating here, however there is still a huge volume profile PoC centered around the 590 $ level so we would not be surprised to see a revisit of these lower levels prior to a longer term resolution.Overall we remain fairly bullish considering we are still in the VST ProTrade with a target up around 620 $, however we want to keep a tight leash on this trade in case price action turns against us leading up to OKC futures settlement late tomorrow night.  If a selloff materializes then we can get out with a small profit and try to reload down in the more favorable 575 $ area, but if not we are ready to hold the VST PT as long as the market has its upside bias.  Longer term we remain outright bullish which means we will continue to be strong holders of our MT position off of 480 $.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/free-reports/bitcoin-price-report-for-september-14-2016 Bitcoin Price Update for September 13, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  The bitcoin bulls continue to defend the 600 $ level, a good sign considering this is an overbought market, although the lack of a continuation up into what has been stronger resistance in the 620 - 630 $ is mildly disappointing up to this point.  Having said that, it does not appear to us as though either side really has an advantage in this environment, fundamentally or technically, which is why we think we could continue to chop around within the symmetrical triangle consolidation for the remainder of the week (at least).  This would allow the oscillators to recharge and would likely lead to more pronounced squeeze conditions, both of which would be supportive of a move higher in the not too distant future.Today we revisit the daily chart for a look at the entirety of the current triangle formation.  We can see that despite the rally up to 630 $ last week, the bulls were still unable to break above the descending trendline and now we are pulling back to the middle of the pattern once again.  Also notice that price is still in a pivot area which is keeping things elevated, and SCMR is painting neutral candles with dynamic support building at 570 and 594 $.  Additionally, the 9/18 EMA cross is still bullish but is losing steam, the 200-day SMA remains in an uptrend, and we are currently in a volume profile notch area that could use some more attention.Moving on, we can see that momentum remains a concern considering Willy is still overbought, RSI has rolled over, MACD is testing the zeroline again, and PPO is flashing minor sell signals.  On the other hand, note that the A/D line is still climbing higher throughout this period of consolidation which confirms our thesis that this is still just a large shakeout within a broader bull market. For the time being we remain long in the VST ProTrade, although we are raising our stoploss to above breakeven, with a target back up near the upper triangle trendline which now sits between 620 - 625 $.  Generally speaking we are bullish going into the Fall, however we think there is a good possibility of another dip or two lower prior to an upside resolution out of this triangle.  We hope to take the VST PT off soon on a bounce so that we can deploy fresh capital if/when price comes back down into our still active buy zones.  Remember, given we are already long off of 480 $ in the MT ProTrade, we are simply trying to add some alpha to this play which is why smaller position size and a quicker trigger finger are probably the right way to approach the shorter term setups.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Bitcoin Price Update for September 12, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  As expected, the market indeed took a leg lower over the weekend following what was a feeble attempt to break sustainably above the 630 $ resistance level on volume.  Clearly the market is trading primarily according to technicals considering this latest failure at a key confluence area, not to mention the fact that the dump yesterday was catalyzed by price action and not fundamentals or news.  In light of this, we want to make sure we take advantage of the opportunities presented by a market that is in tune with the charts, which is why we have entered the VST ProTrade and are waiting with fresh capital in case price makes one final leg lower into our 570 - 580 $ buy zone. Moving on to the currently all important technicals we can see on the 12-hour chart below that the symmetrical triangle remains firmly intact, particularly now that we have another touch point on the descending trendline.  Also notice that the breakout failure materialized right around the 200-period SMA, as well as at strong historical SCMR dynamic resistance, both of which will continue to be trouble spots for bulls on the way out of this larger consolidation range.  Having said that, we do have multiple areas of relatively new SCMR dynamic support just below the market and it is still painting green candles despite the weekend breakdown below 600 $. As far as momentum and volume are concerned, Willy is now coming down slightly out of officially overbought territory, RSI is testing its centerline, MACD has rolled over below zero, and the 9/18 EMA cross is close to turning bearish once again.  Conversely, volume remains fairly healthy considering that the A/D line is still steadily climbing to the upside, trading volumes are picking up, and price is in a wide volume profile notch that has been needing some attention for quite some time.  A basic recharge of momentum along with volume signs that buyers remain at these levels are likely all the bulls need to give the 620 - 630 $ area another go in our opinion, hence the VST ProTrade.Overall we remain medium to long term bullish on this market which is why we want to continue to buy the dips, however we also think that downside technical pressure will have a significant influence on near term price action.  A move down to test SCMR dynamic support, volume profile PoC, the ascending triangle trendline, and short term OTE long zone all in our 570 - 580 $ buy area seems reasonable. Having said that, we are still staying long off of the sub-600 $ levels we saw yesterday in case the bulls decide they've had enough suppression.  Optimally we can take this VST PT off on a relatively small bounce from here in order to prepare to back up the truck on a move down into the sweet spot around 575 $.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/free-reports/bitcoin-price-report-for-september-12-2016 Bitcoin Price Update for September 9, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  The bitcoin price rally that we have seen over the past week has stalled in the 620 - 630 $ resistance area, although it is holding up much better than we initially expected.  While we are not ready to take the possibility of a deeper pullback off of the table, we do think that odds are increasing that we simply get a continuation following a short but necessary consolidation in this region.  That being said, we still favor a somewhat more substantial dip down into the 600 $ area which we would be buyers of due to a confluence of technicals around there.  Overall the market continues to look bullish, we just need a recharge to refill the tank for the next move.We revisit the 6-hour chart today due to the fact that there are some interesting things materializing right now.  First of all, notice that price has finally broken above the symmetrical triangle downtrend line, and ever since has been following it to the downside as a test.  As long as the bulls can hold this line then the chances of a continuation higher increase significantly, however a break of it would likely lead to the pullback we have been waiting for.  Additionally, total volume and market structure looks fairly bearish at these levels despite SCMR continuing to paint bright green bullish candles.  Speaking of SCMR, new dynamic support continues to build below the market in our 590 - 600 $ buy zone, as well as down in the 570 $ area.  Both of these support zones are relatively strong compared to the old dynamic resistance at 630 $ so at some point we do expect it to break to the upside.Moving on we can see that Willy remains in officially overbought territory, RSI is pulling back but has some room to run before testing the centerline, MACD is painting a nasty bearish divergence, and PPO is painting strong sell signals.  Conversely, the A/D line continues to press higher indicating that buyers are still adamant at these levels, and volume profile actually looks pretty healthy compared to what we were looking at last week.  Finally, the 200 SMA is still bottoming out but should provide support in the 600 $ area, while the EMA's remain bullish despite the recent pause.  All in all, we have a rather mixed picture technically speaking going into this weekend.  There is a chance that the bulls hold the 615 $ level, where the triangle trendline is sitting, which would likely catalyze another leg to the upside late in the weekend going into next week (perhaps up to the 650 $ area).  Otherwise, we are expecting a small breakdown over the next few days which would lead price into our ProTrade buy zones that we have eyeing in order to add to our MT trade.  Either way, we feel ready to go with the flow of the market this weekend regardless of what materializes given our very favorable positioning from the early August dump below 500 $.GLGT & have a great weekend!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Bitcoin Price Update for September 8, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  Another leg of the rally has taken price into the 620 - 630 $ resistance range at the top of the current symmetrical triangle formation.  This indeed confirms our upside bias but also reinforces the idea that the market needs at least a quick breather before making moves up into the mid to high 600's $.  The bulls have been fairly strong so far, which means we are not looking for a big move to the downside in the immediate future, but we still think that a test of the 580 - 600 $ region would be healthy and regenerative for a market that is currently stretched from a technical perspective.Moving on to said technicals, we can see on the 12-hour chart below that price is now butting up against some serious resistance in the form of the descending triangle trendline, the 200- period SMA, heavy SCMR dynamic resistance, and a large volume profile notch.  Also notice that momentum is now highly overbought on this timeframe as well (in addition to the 6-hour chart we showed yesterday) with Willy and RSI officially there, while MACD struggles to find any juice above the zeroline.  All of these indication are concerning from a nearer term perspective, however it's not all bad news for the bulls over a slightly longer timeframe.First of all, the A/D line remains in a slow and steady uptrend, a sign that some serious accumulation is and has been going on for quite some time below 700 $.  Additionally, SCMR is painting bright green candles meaning price action still favors the bulls, and pattern-wise it looks even more likely that the Elliot Wave ABC correction has played out which would mean that the lows are in for this mini-consolidation cycle.  Finally, volume seems to be confirming upside bias as well considering yesterday we saw an encouraging small volume breakout on total exchange volume.  This tells us that global interest in the bitcoin market is reemerging following what has been a historically slow summer for price action.It should be clear that we remain medium to long term bullish on bitcoin with the expectation of a breakout to the upside above 700 $ by the end of this year at the latest.  Despite the need for a pullback over the near term in order to recharge the oscillators and put in a cleaner double bottom, we would be unequivocal buyers of that dip in order to pad our MT ProTrade position off of the 480 $ level which we are still holding.  We think this is the beginning of another exciting period for the still dominant cryptocurrency, although a bit more patience is required before getting too bulled up just yet.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/free-reports/bitcoin-price-report-for-september-8-2016 Bitcoin Price Update for September 7, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  The bulls have so far been able to successfully defend the 600 $ level, rather surprisingly, although price is now in an area in which it will be tough to continue higher without some sort of a recharge of the technicals.  We are starting to think that what has been a nice little 5% rally off of the 565 $ double bottom is just the beginning of a much larger move to the upside, perhaps to test the top of the current trading range between 450 - 700 $, however we also think that the indicators need a near term pullback in order to sync up with the higher timeframe charts. Speaking of charts, let's take a look at the 6-hour for an overview of the shorter term setup.  We can see that SCMR is still painting bright green bullish candles and is building strong dynamic support between 565 - 570 $, also where volume profile PoC sits, as well as around the 590 $ level (which is new).  We also have upside stacking in the EMA's in addition to a break and hold of a flattening 200-period SMA which now sits around the top of the pivot area at 600 $.  Lastly on the bullish side of things, the A/D line is confirming the move to the upside and exchange volumes are finally picking up, both of which tell us to continue buying dips.On the other hand, we are currently running up against heavy resistance which makes a pullback around current levels more probable.  Notice that price is well within the OTE short zone, well outside of the volume profile value area, and is getting awfully close to the triangle downtrend line which now resides around 620 $.  Additionally, Willy is now officially overbought, RSI is as well and is painting a bearish divergence, MACD is rolling over back to the zeroline, and PPO is heavily overbought too.  Considering the near term technicals in the context of the longer term bull market we think we are getting closer to the upside resolution we have been calling for for months.  That said we also think that a pullback is due in order to recharge the technicals, washout late longs, and give investors another chance to pick up coins sub-600 $.  We would be small buyers in in the 590 - 600 $ range, and would come in with more size in the 575 - 580 $ area.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Bitcoin Price Update for September 6, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  And, we're back!  After some long overdue and much needed time off, we return with renewed invigoration and conviction regarding our recent forecasts.  Despite a continuation of the absence of fundamental catalysts, the technicals proved to be enough to spark a breakout from the previous 565 - 585 $ trading range as expected.  Now with price sitting just above 600 $ but just below the still intact symmetrical triangle, we stand at a critical juncture with regard to where we might be headed over the course of the next few weeks.  So, without further ado, let's take a look at the daily chart below for a classic medium term view of the current state of the market.We can see that indeed price is now near the upper bound of the triangle consolidation that the market has been stuck in for almost three months, which means that multiple resistance areas exist right overhead in the form of the pivot area and the downtrend line.  Also notice that SCMR is still painting some dynamic resistance around the key 630 $ level, although we finally have new support at 565 $ along with green candles and a myriad of reversal signals.  Additionally, we have some decent market structure to work with following a small Adam & Eve double bottom in the 560's $, and we continue to watch a still intact Elliot Wave ABC correction.Moving on to momentum and volume we can see that Willy and RSI are now firmly in uptrends despite rapidly approaching overbought territory, MACD is picking up some steam above the zeroline, and PPO is now neutral but trending higher.  Not only that, but the near term EMA's have crossed over bullishly and the 200-day SMA has held as support while continuing to press higher, signaling we are still in a bull market.  Finally, volume is not as bullish as the other indications considering that there remain multiple large volume profile notches both above and below that market that could use some work, not to mention exchange volumes remain anemic, however the A/D line continues to indicate that buyers are still outpacing sellers even at these levels.From a longer term perspective bitcoin remains in a wide consolidation range between 450 - 700 $ as players continue to position for the next substantial move.  While our call for a rally up to resistance going into this week was the right one, we also realize that there could be some minor downside from here if we stick to our roadmap from last week.  One final downside washout back to support at the bottom of the triangle between 550 - 570 $ would allow us to jump back in once again for what we think will be at least a test of 630 $.  This would also recharge the momentum oscillators which would greatly increase the chances of moving above 630 $ once we are able to get there.  At this point, there just might not be enough left in the bulls' tanks to push through such heavy resistance on the first try.To sum up, we are staying generally bullish but near term cautious.  Dips can continue to be bought, and now that we have confirmation of upside bias we can put a little more juice in these trades than we have been for the past several weeks.  Things should be getting exciting again soon in Bitcoinland (at long last!).GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Bitcoin Price Update for September 2, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  As we have been forecasting all week, bitcoin has indeed remained trapped in the 565 - 585 $ consolidation zone (and within that primarily in the 570 - 580 $ area).  Yesterday we saw a small test of the lower end of that range, and today we are making moves back into the mid to high 570's $.  While we cannot rule out a spike in volatility over the next few days, we think most of the action will materialize later in the long weekend (Sunday going into Monday).  Despite the fact that the technicals still are not all that clear on directionality seeing as though this flat market has transitioned into indecision, we still see no reason to change our generally bullish bias going into Autumn. Speaking of flat technicals, let's take a look at the 6-hour chart once again for an idea of where we may be heading over the next 24 - 48 hours.  We can see that price remains in the symmetrical triangle however it is slowly creeping down to the lower trendline over time.  Also, SCMR is painting yet another upside reversal candle, but is once again price having difficulty following through on any pick up in volumes.  Also note that price is still pinned to the large volume profile PoC while the A/D line continues higher, and it appears as though the bulls are trying to put in a rather elongated double bottom around 565 $.Moving on to momentum we can see that Willy and RSI are gaining some strength following bullish divergences over the past week, MACD is still flatlined around the zeroline, and PPO remains neutral. Finally, the 9/18 EMA cross is almost complete flat as well, and the 200-period SMA continues to press lower, now sitting in the heart of the near term OTE short zone.  Considering what is still a rather convoluted technical picture over the short to medium term, we remain hesitant to move back into the market in size on the long side prior to a clearer signal on a break of the current trading ranges.  Until then, we will remain cautiously long in our VST ProTrade and comfortably long in our MT ProTrade.Optimally we would like to see the market move up to our VST exit target over the next few days prior to a washout back to the downside which would allow us to add to our longer term trade.  Despite this apparent bullishness on our part, we realize that the current extended consolidation off of the 780 $ highs could have alot more room to run until the market starts to trend again.  Ultimately we are still in a large 465 - 700 $ range, which allows for trade flexibility although keep in mind that trading large ranges is often harder than it looks or seems.  Finally, we will be out of pocket for the next few days due to the Labor Day holiday in the US, however we will issue email and Slack alerts if warranted by extreme price action. Also, AKWAnalytics should be available on Slack during the morning hours over the weekend, but if not please leave a DM and he will get back to you asap.  Thanks and have a great one!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Bitcoin Price Update for September 1, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  As we start to wrap up one of the slowest weeks in bitcoin's history in terms of price action, we continue to sit patiently in our long positions.  Despite the possibility of a breakdown out of the medium term triangle consolidation, we still like the risk/reward profiles present in our VST and MT ProTrades. Having said that, we are currently not expecting any substantial increase in volatility over the next few days but we do think it will pick back up as we head into the latter half of the long holiday weekend.  As has been the case for months, our bias remains to the upside, however we fully acknowledge the possibility that a dump down to the 500 $ area is possible prior to another test of the upside, which is why we are keeping tight stops on the shorter term trades.Moving on to the technical details, we can see on the daily chart below that indeed the symmetrical triangle remains in full effect and price remains right in the middle of the formation.  Also notice that price continues to hug the volume profile PoC despite large notches on either side it, and the SCMR upside reversal candle painted a few days ago remains intact as well (although it has been flirting with a cancellation so we are not out of the woods just yet).  Speaking of SCMR, note that neutral bars are still coming in and we still do not have even minor dynamic support other than at the 525 $ level going back to June, so conviction is low on both sides of the ball.As far as momentum and volume, it should come as no surprise that Willy and RSI are still chopping around in no man's land while MACD and the EMA's continue to flatten out.  Additionally, PPO is still showing weak buy signals while the A/D line continues to move slowly to the upside on low exchange volumes, telling us that there is at least some weak demand still at these levels.  Finally, the 200-day SMA remains in an uptrend thus confirming the longer term bull market and its lengthy consolidation, however multiple support and resistance areas both below and above the market will likely keep price range bound for the time being.Generally speaking we continue to think there is a chance of a breakout from the triangle over the weekend and going into early next week, although we would be surprised to see things go beyond the OTE zones noted on the chart even if that materializes.  Until then, however, the 540 $ support level and the 630 $ resistance level remain the ones to watch for potential breakouts.  Until one of those key areas is tested the market will remain stagnant and, frankly, downright boring.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/
Bitcoin Price Update for August 31, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  Although things were looking pretty good yesterday for near term bulls, the market once again turned south following a tag of the 580 $ resistance area.  Now price is sitting back down in the 570 - 575 $ area where it has felt so comfortable for over a month.  We are not expecting any action in the market until later in the weekend going into early next week, therefore we remain neutral on a market that is stagnant and indecisive at current levels.  We will continue to remain patient overall given a still mixed bag of technicals and some waiting time until the next fundamental catalyst (Bitcoin Core 0.13.1), however we are willing to hold our small VST ProTrade long for the time being.Today we revisit the 6-hour chart for a look at the short to medium term prospects.  We can see that price remains flat within the pivot area, and also continue to hug volume profile PoC, while market structure vacillates between bullish and bearish.  Also note that trading volumes remain anemic and volume profile looks relatively thin on either side of the current trading range, however the A/D line is still slowly pressing to the upside so it appears as though there are still buyers around current levels. Additionally, SCMR continue to paint mixed signals as we had a potential upside reversal that was cancelled a few bars later, but now we have a re-confirmation of the reversal although there has been no follow-through in price action yet. Moving on to momentum we can see that the near term EMA's are almost completely flat, the 200-period SMA is still bearish, and PPO is close to signaling slightly overbought conditions despite practically no movement to the upside so far this week.  Finally, we can see that Willy and RSI both failed to push sustainably above their respective centerlines, while MACD continues to dance around it's zeroline as well.  None of these indications are all that encouraging, at least not from a near term perspective, so for now we are expecting more of the same until we get closer to the holiday weekend.  Considering how tight the market is coiling right now, and has been for some time, we think that when a break of the symmetrical triangle/consolidation range materializes it will send some shockwaves of volatility through the market.  The key levels to watch are now 540 $ on the downside and 630 $ on the upside, so keep an eye out for a break of one of these levels over the next few weeks.  A break lower would likely take us down into the MT ProTrade add zone just below 500 $, while a breakout higher would likely send prices up to more significant resistance in the form of the OTE short zone around 700 $.  For the time being, however, we continue to sit on the sidelines in order to wait for more favorable setups.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/free-reports/bitcoin-price-report-for-august-31-2016 Indeed, buy and hold also made profit for those early buyers who bought before 2013.

Cheers!Market Commentary (BTC):  Despite still being trapped within the 565 - 585 $ area, price is slowly moving up to the top of that range as expected.  While follow through on this move has been anemic, we think price action will pick up if the 580 $ resistance level can be broken on decent volume.  We say this due to some emerging technical signals on the medium term chart, as well as the fact that Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 (which will contain SegWit code) is now over 30% complete.  Even though we are still in the final days of the summer doldrums, we think this combination of positive technicals and fundamentals could give the market some juice to the upside.  To find out where we might be heading, lets turn to the 12-hour chart below.We can see that price remains firmly within the symmetrical triangle, as well as the pivot area, and is sitting right on top of the volume profile PoC.  Also note that SCMR painted a confirmed upside reversal yesterday, the first since June, and despite no new dynamic support yet we can see dynamic resistance slowly weakening over time.  Additionally, market structure is starting to come in slightly more bullish and the Vix is indicating that an increase in volatility is likely nearing, therefore we think a move up into the volume profile notch around 600 $ is a possibility over the next week or so.Having said that, we still have mixed signals coming from momentum and volume which is why we are not ready to call a breakout rally imminent just yet.  Notice that Willy is heading back to the downside despite the possible reversal in price, RSI has not been able to break above the 50-line, and the 9/18 EMA cross remains flat for the time being.  We can also see that MACD has finally jumped over the zeroline although without much fanfare, while the A/D line continues to slowly press to the upside. While we think a move higher is more likely than not, we don't think it will be very large in magnitude considering the mixed oscillators as well as the heavy resistance overhead in the form of SCMR, OTE, volume profile, and the 200-period SMA.  Getting through 630 $ will still be a very tall task for the bulls, but 600 $ is a more realistic possibility.Overall we continue to slowly move into the bullish camp given we now have a short term risk/reward profile that we can live with, which is why the new VST ProTrade was issued.  Despite this tempered positivity, unless price can breakout of the larger triangle that we remain in between 540 - 630 $ then the market will stay in this sideways consolidation, albeit with a bit more volatility, going into September.  We are still hopeful that we get another shot to add to longs down in our buy zones, but for now this small long scalp will have to do.Thanks! AKWAnalytics and S3052 Bitcoin Price Update for August 29, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  Once again no surprises over the weekend as price remains locked in a tight consolidation, although we did get a small break from the 570 - 580 $ range when price dipped into the mid-560's over the weekend.  With a new range in effect from 565 - 585 $ and considering we are going into a long holiday weekend, we think the price action will remain subdued over the course of this week.  Having said that, there are some early technical indications emerging on the shorter term charts that are signaling a potential move to the upside to test resistance at the top of the range.With that in mind, lets move to the 6-hour chart below for a look at the short to medium term outlook. First of all, notice that price is still within the symmetrical triangle, as well as the pivot area, as it has been for some time, and it now appears to be trapped between volume profile PoC and the near term EMA's.  Speaking of volume profile, it continues to look relatively healthy compared to the longer term charts so perhaps a move up into OTE is not out of the question over the next few weeks, but for now this looks unlikely over the very short term.  Moving on, we can see that SCMR is painting neutral candles following a "confirmed reversal up" candle late in the weekend which has not yet been voided despite little progress to the upside.  Additionally, Willy has reversed back to the upside, RSI is back in neutral territory following a bullish divergence, and MACD and PPO are both showing signs of at least a local bottom around 565 $.  These are encouraging signs that could indicate a small upside bias this week, although we are still not buyers of coins at these levels.Conversely, we have minor dynamic support sitting at the 554 $ low and resistance around 585 $, however major support is nowhere to be found while major resistance still hangs overhead at 600 $ and 630 $.  Also note that the 200-period SMA remains in a downtrend signaling the short term correction is still not over, while the EMA's flatline around current prices telling us there remains indecision in this market.  While we are not expecting a significant move beyond the 565 - 585 $ range in either direction over the course of this week, we do think a move up to test that 580 - 585 $ area is a distinct possibility.  Perhaps when we get back to business next Tuesday following the Labor Day holiday in the US we can breakout of this range to test our 545 - 555 $ buy zone or the 600 - 630 $ resistance area.  Until then, we remains patient and neutral.Remember, in a trendless and contracting market, which we are currently in, buying the dips and selling the rips remains the most relevant strategy for short term and more risk-seeking players.  That said, we remain on the sidelines at current levels considering we want to add to long positions at more favorable risk/reward levels.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/free-reports/bitcoin-price-report-for-august-29-2016 Bitcoin Price Update for August 26, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  As we head into the final weekend of August, the market remains stagnant around the 575 $ level. Despite a few pops up to resistance at 580 $ and a few dumps down to test the bottom of the range at 570 $, for the most part the market has been steadily trading sideways for pretty much the entire week. We think this period of extreme inactivity will give way to more volume and volatility within the next several weeks, which is likely not what traders want to hear, but the market just does not seem ready to resolve out of this area yet.  Until it is ready, price will remain trapped in a series of ranges, the most relevant of which now sits between 570 - 580 $.  Before signing off for the weekend we want to take a look at the daily chart for a a view of what the market has done throughout the summer.  First of all, we can see that price is still right in the middle of a symmetrical triangle consolidation off of the June highs, and is also stuck between a large demand area and a pivot zone from the June lows.  Also note that SCMR is still painting neutral candles and dynamic resistance continues to build at 630 $, although the flattening EMA's and still bullish 200 SMA are signaling that this indeed remains an extended sideways consolidation within a bull market.Moving on to momentum and volume, notice that Willy and RSI are still chopping around in no man's land while MACD tries to break the zeroline following a substantial bullish divergence on the recent low's below 500 $.  Additionally, PPO is still showing bottoming conditions, although not as strong as a week or two ago, and the A/D line remains in an uptrend despite a small roll over the past few days.  Finally, exchange volumes continue to wane and multiple volume profile notches still exist both above and below the market.  This is telling us that we may have more time within this consolidation while price discovery continues, with the short to medium term volume bias being to the downside considering the large gap between 480 - 550 $.Generally speaking we remains neutral and patient while price flatlines around 575 $.  As was the case last weekend, we are not expecting a significant move above or below the current trading range, although spikes are possible, however we would continue to play the near term by buying the dips and selling the rips while we wait for the market to come back down into our buy zones.Have a great weekend!  GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I91jxLi-28 Bitcoin Price Update for August 24, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  As the tight, sideways chop persists through the majority of this week due to mixed technicals and relatively boring fundamentals, we want to take a closer look at what the market is doing within the multiple consolidation patterns price is stuck in on multiple timeframes.  It has been tough to get a good gauge on the market following the Finex bottom and subsequent bounce, and it still is, however more encouraging signs continue to emerge as we press on in this still contracting 570 - 590 $ range.  With that in mind let's move on to the updated 4-hour chart below for a look at the short term technicals.We can see that price was able to breakout of this specific symmetrical triangle, although price remained heavy and the apex was quickly tested.  Now the market is riding the triangle uptrend line despite neutral SCMR candles and new dynamic support around 570 $, however there remains significant resistance overhead in the form of the medium term OTE short zone and the minor supply area which has already rejected price at 585 $ a couple of times.  Throw in the fact that the 9/18 EMA cross has flatlined and the 200-period SMA remains bearish and falling around 600 $, and we still have a thoroughly confusing market on our hands for the time being.Having said that, notice that Willy and RSI are recharging nicely down at the centerline despite a stagnation in price, as is the Stochastic, however the CM PPO is still showing slightly more overbought conditions than we would prefer.  Finally, volume profile looks healthy around current levels although work still needs to be done below the market while trendline and OTE support still sits between 500 - 530 $, but we still have a rising A/D line and low trading volumes so perhaps price remains elevated for now.  Generally speaking we are still in the camp that a bullish resolution is coming in the next month or two. This is particularly true considering that it seems we are now in the middle of the traditional pre-bitcoin rally altcoin pump, which still gives the charts some time to align themselves prior to that upside move. Despite some early positive signals on the shorter term 4-hour timeframe, the longer term charts are still not there yet.  While we think a move up to test 600 $ and maybe even 630 $ over the next 5 days remains a possibility, we are not betting on it just yet as you can see by the ProTrade levels below.GLGT! Interesting view. What do other think? good point. On top, we have some more resistances in different price ranges in our analysis that could prove to be even more critical.

Market Commentary (BTC):  Despite the fact that the bitcoin price was able to push up to the 590 $ near term OTE short zone resistance yesterday, a failure to break above there caused another overnight selloff back down to 580 $.  Now we are once again treading water around 585 $, as we did for most of the day yesterday, although we will say that a series of higher lows over the past five days still has us leaning slightly bullish for the time being.  While we are skeptical of a breakout above 600 $ in the next few days, we do think the bulls make a run for it by the end of the weekend.  Another failure there would likely mean we revisit the lower half of the 550 - 600 $ trading range, but as per the ProTrades below we would be buyers of that dip.Today we want to return to our favorite medium term chart to see if we can glean any clues as to timing and directionality of the next move.  We can see below the SCMR is trying to paint green candles but there are some neutral ones scattered in there as well.  Also note that dynamic support is still building around 570 $, which is also where a volume profile mini-PoC sits, and is right in the middle of the current pivot zone.  Additionally, the 9/18 EMA cross is starting to turn back to the upside, the 200-period SMA is still rising but will be resistance on the way back up, and there is a large volume profile notch that needs some filling in just above 600 $.  Moving on to momentum and volume, notice that Willy is above the centerline but is rapidly approaching overbought territory while price remains relatively flat, RSI is above the centerline as well but has stalled out, and MACD remains pinned near zero as the MA's continue to flatten.  Additionally, despite the fact that the A/D line is still generally trending slowly higher, we have seen a slight dip over the past day or two which indicates there could be some distribution happening in the upper half of the aforementioned 550 - 600 $ trading range.  Finally, exchange volumes remain unimpressive signaling a lack of conviction from either the bulls or the bears for the time being.  Given a mixed technical picture and poor seasonality we think the market will continue to chop around between 570 - 590 $ through the middle part of this week.  That said, we think there is a decent shot at an upside test of 600 $ prior to a move back down to SCMR support at 570 $ early next week.  While the dog days of summer press on, we remain neutral and patient at current levels considering price action is anemic and risk/reward profiles are unattractive on both sides of the market.GLGT!Discount: 30% for the next 7 days.

More broadly speaking, the financial markets are still in the dog days of summer(aka, summer doldrums) which are characterized by low volume and low volatility, and which are causedprimarily by wealthy vacationers stepping away from the markets. More specific to bitcoin, the halving hasbeen properly digested so far, Seg Wit and other code improvements are slowly rolling out, and price is aroundwhere the market seems to think fair value currently is. While we are expecting a least a few more weeks ofsideways consolidation, we remain of the mind that an upside resoltion is coming as we move into Autumn.When we began working up the charts earlier we were surprised by how resilient and supportivethe weekly chart below looks. SCMR is still not painting any red candles and dynamic supportcontinues to build just below 400 $. It also appears as though the market is forming a bullish pennantpattern with the recent low coming in on a bullish volume divergence. Speaking of that 465 $low, notice that it was right in the OTE long zone, right at the top of the demand area, right on theuptrend line, and right on historical resistance turned support. This 450 - 465 $ area is strong.Conversely, Willy remains relatively overbought, RSI looks heavy, MACD has dropped below the zeroline, and the9/18 EMA cross contiues to flatten. Additionally, despite pressing to the upside in a firm uptrend, the 200-week SMAis still all the way down near dynamic support at 360 $, which is also the bottom of the downtrend pennant channel.While we cannot technically rule out a test of the high 300s $ at some point, we think it remains very unlikey and wewould be strong buyers of that move. The more likely path over the next few months in our opinion is a continuationof the sideways consolidation between 450 - 700 $ prior to an upside resolution going into the end of the year. https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ You have very good points about that there are still risks with bitfinex.That said, I still think that this won't have any mid term significant effect on bitcoin as a whole. This is because bitfinex only stads for less than 5% of global bitcoin exchange volume. You are right, MACD, EMA, stochastic etc. alone do not guarantee to make profit.

Bitcoin Price Update for August 19, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  Incredibly, the bitcoin price simply refuses to move from this 570 - 580 $ range as both bulls and bears get immediately spurned on any minute move in either direction.  Going into what may be the slowest trading weekend of the year seasonally speaking, we are watchful but not optimistic about a breakout of this range.  The lack of fundamental catalysts combined with still mixed technicals means that we must remain neutral and patient going into next week, although we do think a move out of the larger 555 - 600 $ trading area is coming in the next week or two.  Until then, though, we remain on the sidelines.Today we take another look at the 6-hour chart for the short term overview since we will be covering the medium and long term outlooks in the full report on Monday.  We can see that price has truly flatlined around 570 $ which is where volume profile PoC is sitting, as are both the 9 and the 18 EMA's.  Also note that SCMR is painting all neutral candles now as indecision remains prevalent, and we are lacking in dynamic support and resistance anywhere near current levels.  As long as price remains within the light blue pivot area, risk/reward will continue to be unfavorable for all but the most nimble range traders who can buy the dips and sell the rips within this near term 565 - 575 $ zone.Getting to momentum and volume, notice that Willy is moving swiftly to the upside despite little progress in terms of price, RSI continues to struggle at the centerline, and MACD remains pinned near zero. Additionally, volume profile remains very porous both above and below current prices and trading volumes continue to be anemic, although a still rising A/D line indicates that perhaps there are more buyers at these levels than meets the eye.  Finally, OTE long zone support down just below the medium term uptrend line around 500 $ continues to be our preferred reload zone, however we would still be interested in taking a shot on the long side in the 540 - 550 $ area as per our VST ProTrade.  Conversely, significant SCMR dynamic resistance still hangs overhead around 630 $ so that is where we would be taking profits on any long positions.While it may seem as though this consolidation will never end, we know from experience that just when it looks the most hopeless is when the market starts to move.  We still prefer the idea that we head slightly lower out of this range first before eventually resolving to the upside, but at this point it is pretty much a waiting game until we get technical confirmation one way or the other.Have a great weekend!  GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/free-reports/bitcoin-price-report-for-august-19-2016**If you're interested in getting more than these free reports, msg me, or contact BBA.

Market Commentary (BTC):Not much to say this morning given the markets are fully in the grip of the summer doldrums. This period of extreme stagnation prompted us to go back and take a look at what happened last summer around this time, and indeed the same conditions were present then prior to an upside resolution later in the Fall. While we cannot guarantee that this same outcome will materialize again this year, we think there is a fairly good chance that something similar does occur (at least in terms of a breakout in one direction or the other). Seeing as though we are still in a slow period as far as fundamentals go, we remain primarily focused on the technicals for the time being.We return to the 12-hour chart for another look at the medium term setup. There is no doubt the the market is currently locked in a period of indecision and uncertainty seeing as though price has been trading within the light blue pivot zone all week (only a ~25 $ range), and remains firmly in the middle of the symmetrical triangle. Also notice that SCMR has been vacillating between red and blue candles, those being bearish and upside reversal signals respectively, while dynamic resistance overhead at 600 and 630 $ both slowly loosen their grip on the market.Moving on, we still have a minor OTE short zone sitting between 580 - 600 $ while the OTE long zone remains down around the 500 $ level, which is also still the top of the major demand area. Not only that, but price remains stuck trading around this volume profile mini-PoC that lies between two large notches, although the A/D line continues to press slowly to the upside indicating buyers remain at these levels. As far as momentum goes we are getting mixed signals as well considering Willy has pulled back nicely, RSI looks like it has bottomed near term, and MACD is poking its head above the zeroline.Despite the possibility of a quick washout back down into support in the low to mid-500's $, where we still want to be buyers, we think the market may turn more bullish than many are expecting over the next week or two. The small but effective Adam & Eve double bottom that appears to be materializing around the 560 $ level is making us slightly more bullish than we were earlier in the week even in the face of a very murky short term technical outlook. We would not be surprised to see the action pick up slightly over the weekend as we slowly move out of the dog days of summer, and we now have a slightly more bullish bias so take that for what its worth.GLGThttps://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ You have a good point indeed about fundamentals. That said, very often we have seen the technical picture turning bullish before fundamentals. Since we cover bitcoins in 2011, this has helped many times to be in the market before a major rally. Market Commentary (BTC):  The waiting game persists as the bitcoin markets continue to compress during this slow summer trading season.  Despite the possibility that we could remain locked in the 550 - 600 $ range for a few more weeks, this newer 570 - 580 $ range will likely break sometime this week or this weekend.  While the technicals are still not all that helpful in terms of directionality, from a market makers perspective the struggle to make profit in these tight conditions is very real.  In light of this near term uncertainty we want to stay neutral and patient at current levels, although we are still in a "buy the dips, sell the rips" mentality until further notice.Today we zoom in on the 4-hour chart below given it has been awhile since we have taken a serious look at shorter term technicals.  The first thing to notice is that we have another working symmetrical triangle on this timeframe in addition to the longer term charts, which continues to squeeze price into the current 570 - 580 $ range (and is also where volume profile PoC is and hence where near term fair value is).  Also note that there is a new minor pivot area from 555 - 570 $ which should provide some support on dips, and SCMR is once again painting neutral/mixed candles following a few days of bullish price action earlier this week.  Finally, the OTE short zone continues to sit right overhead between 585 - 620 $ while the major OTE long zone still lies between 500 - 520 $, not to mention that volume profile leaves much to be desired, all of which is telling us that even a break of the current trading range might not catalyze a very large move this time around.Momentum and volume are also telling a confusing story considering Willy is heading higher but is hitting centerline resistance, RSI is heading down to test the 40 level, and MACD continues to stagnate around zero.  Additionally, the 9/18 EMA cross has flatlined at current prices and the 200-period SMA remains bearish, although conversely the A/D line is still healthy and trading volumes are slightly more bullish now than they were earlier in the week.  For the time being price will stay within the 570 - 580 $ range until we get a move above or below there.  Our thinking for the time being is that we could move down to test the lower triangle trendline around 560 $ before finding support once again and then attempting to move above 580 $.All said, we remain buyers down in the 540 - 550 $ area for a shorter term scalp trade, as well as down in the 500 $ region for a longer term play.  Having said that, until there is some conviction on one side or the other, the bitcoin markets will remain stagnant in a large, extended consolidation between 450 - 700 $.  We still think an upside resolution materializes in the latter part of this year, however at this point we are relegated to sitting on the sidelines waiting for the market to come to us.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/free-reports/bitcoin-price-report-for-august-17-2016
Bitcoin Price Update for August 16, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  As the stagnation in the bitcoin markets intensifies once again, patience and discipline become a trader's most valuable tools.  The lack of fundamental catalysts over the near term combined with a still murky technical picture on the medium to long term charts means it's every man for himself in these conditions.  With that in mind, market marker's can create their own small scalp trades within a tight trading range like we are in now due to the size of their capital pool, however us normal traders need to be much more selective in conditions such as these so as to preserve capital to deploy in a more favorable environment.Getting to the aforementioned technicals, today we are looking at the 12-hour chart once again for a closer inspection of the medium term outlook.  To begin, we can see that price remains well within both the larger symmetrical triangle formation, as well as in the light blue pivot area, and continues to fill in volume profile between 550 - 600 $.  Additionally, market structure looks like it is trying to shift to a more bullish pattern while SCMR continues to paint red candles, although it looks like we should see a potential bullish reversal over the next day or two as long as the 554.90 $ low on Stamp can hold. Finally, dynamic resistance is now sitting overhead at 575 $ while the near term OTE short zone sits in the key 580 - 600 $ area, making it difficult for bulls to push through those levels without some help.Moving on, notice that despite persistent weakness over the past few days, the momentum oscillators are still not recharged enough for our liking.  Willy is close to overbought but still has some room to run to the downside, RSI is showing a bullish divergence although it too has room to fall, and MACD has remained resilient but is now close to breaking back below the zeroline.  Not only that, but the A/D line has flatlined, trading volumes are still favoring sellers, and there remains a porous volume profile setup down below 560 $.Generally speaking, we are still in the neutral camp with an inclination to buy dips into our supportive buys zones.  Despite the possibility that we could see a small countertrend move back up into the 580 - 600 $ resistance region, we would not chase that rally considering we still think we could get a shot in the 540 - 550 $ PT area in the not too distant future.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Bitcoin Price Report for August 15, 2016 Market Commentary (BTC):  Indeed we got a rather uneventful weekend, as expected, despite a pullback to the bottom of the still intact trading range between 550 - 600 $.  Following a local low of 556.24 $ yesterday, price has since been slowly recovering back into the 570 $ area.  Seeing as though we are currently in the heart of the summer trading doldrums we are not expecting much movement this week either, although if the 550 - 600 $ range does get broken somehow then stronger support still lies at 520 $ and resistance at 630 $.  With that in mind, let's take a look at the 6-hour chart for a snapshot of the short to medium term technicals.  First of all, notice that the ascending wedge we pointed out last week was indeed a bearish signal as price is now well below those levels.  Also notice that we are still in the light blue pivot zone despite a quick washout below it on Sunday, and we remain in a volume profile mini-PoC region with a notch around 580 $ that needs to be filled in prior to a move out of this range.  Additionally, SCMR is still painting red candles with new minor dynamic resistance building around 575 $, and market structure remains bearish despite the semblance of stability coming back into the market now.  Finally, the 9/18 EMA cross remains ...Chart here: https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/free-reports/bitcoin-price-report-for-august-15-2016 Bitcoin Price Update for August 11, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  Bitfinex began trading again yesterday for the first time in over a week, and surprisingly the market has taken it in stride.  Despite a quick selloff down to the mid-580's $ following some restart issues at Finex, the market just as quickly rebounded back up near the 600 $ level.  Now we are once again pinned to the upper end of the still intact 580 - 600 $ trading range, although price did peak up through there on Bitstamp yesterday to reach a local high of 603 $.  While we still think that a test of higher resistance in the 620 - 630 $ region is a possibility over the course of the next week or two, there are some technical features on the shorter term charts that are giving us pause for the time being.Moving on to said technicals, we can see on the 6-hour chart below that despite price being in a minor uptrend, it is also forming a bearish ascending wedge pattern.  These formation have been fairly accurate in the bitcoin markets over the past 6-12 months so we are giving it due credence. Additionally, we are at the top of the light blue pivot zone, Willy is overbought, RSI and MACD are trying to paint small bearish divergences, and buyside volumes have been unimpressive.  Meanwhile, SCMR is now painting some green candles despite heavy dynamic resistance overhead at 630 $, market structure is starting to turn more positive, and the A/D line is still pressing to the upside. Not only that, but the 9/18 EMA cross is now turning bullish and there is a large volume profile notch above 600 $ that will need to be filled-in in the not too distant future.  Speaking of volume profile, notice that PoC is all the way up above the 200-period SMA so even if we can push through 630 $, there is more resistance waiting in the wings between 640 - 650 $.  Considering that the momentum oscillators are relatively bearish while we are nearing the apex of this ascending wedge, we think another move to the downside in the next few days is a decent possibility. The OTE long zone down around the trendline and at the top of the demand area would be our preferred spot to add to the MT ProTrade, however we are not expecting a move back down to those levels just yet.  Instead, at least over the near term, we would still be buyers of a selloff in to the 530 - 550 $ range.GLGT!https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ If you decide this for yourself, this is fine.We do not force anyone to subscribe to our bitcoin forecasts.That said, we have had so far more than 1,500 thousand people appreciating our forecasts and using it to make very good trading profits. Bitcoin BullBear Price Update for August 10, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  The market continues to settle into this 580 - 600 $ range as positioning for the next breakout move intensifies.  Given that Bitfinex will reopen operations within the next 48 hours, we are expecting volatility to pick up at least a little bit which very well could drive us out of this trading zone.  A move out of this area will likely lead to a 30 $ move in either direction (550 $ if we break down, 630 $ if we break up), but is unlikely to go beyond that in our opinion.  Moving on to the technicals, we can see on the daily chart below that price is rolling over right around a historical resistance line, the bottom of the pivot area, and at the 9 EMA.  Additionally, there is a volume profile notch just overhead and market structure is coming in bearish, while trading volumes continue to confirm the move to the downside last week.  Lastly, notice that SCMR is painting red candles again while also showing multiple reversal cancellations over the past few days.  This is not a great sign for the bulls, but is also not a death knell.Despite these bearish indications, it is not all bad news for the bulls at this time.  Notice that Willy is now testing the centerline while in a slight uptrend, RSI remains pinned in the lower half which means that there is room to run to the upside, and PPO is still painting bright green bars (a bullish signal).  Also, MACD is still showing a substantial bullish divergence from the washout last week and is now challenging the zeroline, while the A/D line continues to press to the upside.  Finally, it now appears that we could be in yet another triangle consolidation with a midpoint right around current levels.  This might help explain the stagnation we have seen over the past week as players resign themselves to the fact that we may be at fair value for the time being.All things considered, we do not want to alter our forecast in any significant way at this time.  Near term caution, medium term neutrality, and longer term bullish bias are how we continue to view the market at this time.  Until we get a breakout from this 580 - 600 $ range we will remain patient in letting the market come to us, however if price does make a move then the key levels to watch are 550 $ to the downside and 630 $ to the upside.  To reiterate, we would continue to employ a "buy the dips, sell the rips" mentality for shorter term scalp trading while we continue to wait for lower prices to add to the longer term positions.  More charts, reports, and our slack channel here: https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/GLGT!

Bitcoin BullBear Price Update for August 9, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  As price continues to struggle in this 580 - 600 $ resistance area, the fact that there hasn't been a breakdown out of this range yet is somewhat encouraging.  That said, the technicals remain mixed on most timeframes and the fundamentals are still uncertain regarding Bitfinex, so at this time we think the market stays in a rather tight range.  If price can break above 600 $ then the key 630 $ resistance level will likely come into play, and if not then we think we will revisit the bottom of the pivot area around 560 $.  Either way, there remain a lack of favorable setups on either the long or the short side at current levels so we will wait for the market to give us a hint as to directionality over the next few days.Today we zoom in slightly via the 6-hour chart below to try to glean some clues as to where we might be headed over the course of this week.  We can see that price is still trapped up in this OTE short zone, pivot area, and volume profile mini-PoC, while SCMR continues to paint neutral candles.  Also notice that the medium term uptrend line remains intact and is rising up to meet the top of the demand area at the key 520 $ level.  We also still have an OTE long zone down in the 500 $ region so if price can manage to get back down there then we will be buyers of that dip.Moving on to momentum and volume we can see that Willy is now officially overbought, RSI is struggling to get over the centerline, and MACD has correct back to zero despite no big price moves. Additionally, the 9/18 EMA cross is flatlining once again, the 200-period SMA is now firmly in a downtrend, and the A/D line is still creeping higher but is hitting resistance.  Lastly, sell volumes still seem to be outweighing buy volumes even though there has been a noticeable decrease in overall trading volume, and volume profile could use some filling in at both higher and lower levels.At this time the market is in gridlock between 580 - 600 $ so until this range is broken one way or the other we will remain in a holding pattern within this area.  As we have been saying for many weeks now this remains a "buy the dips, sell the rips" market until further notice, so we will continue to watch the 500 - 550 $ region for long setups and the 600 - 630 $ area to take profit or get short.  Having said that, buys in the low 500's $ are longer term plays for a potential resolution out of this consolidation, and any shorts put on are very near term in nature and should be considered high risk.  Even still, there could be some good opportunities in the not too distant future.GLGT!See more here: https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/ Bitcoin BullBear Price Update for August 8, 2016  Market Commentary (BTC):  Indeed the weekend brought some subdued price action with a bullish bias up to the 600 $ resistance region as expected.  Now as we enter the new week, price is staying pinned to the 590 $ level which is a sign that there are not as many sellers in this area as previously expected.  Despite the possibility that the bulls continue to push price to the upside through 600 $, we do not think there is enough juice technically speaking to get through heavier resistance around 630 $.  Having said that, we remain buyers around 520 $ and sellers around 630 $ for the time being.Back to the trusty 12-hour chart today for a look at the short to medium term technicals.  First, we can see that price has popped back above the 200-period SMA and 18 EMA, but is now running into resistance in the form of the 9 EMA as well as the top of the pivot zone.  Also notice that we are entering a fairly large volume profile notch as SCMR continues to paint neutral candles, so we may be stalled around these levels for some time.Moving on to momentum we can see that Willy has broken above the centerline but looks somewhat toppy near term, RSI remains below 50 and is flatlining, and MACD is still unconvincing for either bulls or bears.  Additionally, the CM Vix remains bullish considering we have a clear volatility bottom on the 465 $ spike low, while the A/D line continues to press to the upside indicating that there are still buyers at these relatively elevated levels.Seeing as though the market is running into some trouble here around 600 $ while the technicals continue to repair themselves from the damage caused last week, we still think a move back to the downside is likely prior to a breakout over 630 $.  We would be buyers of that dip back into the lower half of the medium term OTE long zone, upper part of the demand area, and around the trendline.  More generally speaking, we think the market remains in a longer term consolidation as we have been saying for months, while we maintain our forecast for an upside resolution eventually.  That said, we could be stuck in this 450 - 750 $ range for another month or two so we will continue to hunt opportunities within this wide trading range.  We think there will be plenty of them over the coming weeks, however things may move a bit slower than normal due to seasonal factors such as summer vacations and "back to school".GLGT!Chart: https://www.bullbearanalytics.com/free-reports/bitcoin-price-report-for-august-8-2016 +1 traurig aber wahr was du schreibst The Poll in this thread is open again.

I can't believe it.A "Wall Street Guru" declares to be bearish AFTER price plunges from 1163 $ to 152$, a decline of 90% (now bitcoin prices are at 236 $). This is typical. Wall street analysts have no clue what's going on.

This reminds us on last year in 2014: Bitcoin prices were at 1000-1100 and people believed in 10,000 - 100,000 $. We know what happened thereafter:The 2014 Crash kurzfristig: Ja.Ansonsten bleiben wir weiter dran bei Bitcoin Forecast & Blog  yes, litecoin moves will be stronger in both directions = more "leverage" Litecoin predictions update:http://bullbearanalytics.com/2015/01/18/litecoin-predictions-breakout/ We gave a bearish bitcoin forecast right next to the top around 1,000 $ in January 2104.Our subscribers get almost always daily updates big trading day for bitcoin today

And with all due respect, some other bitcoin forecasts go all the way towards being outright ridiculous.

I want to elaborate a bit on the comment on Monero I made on October 3, 2014. At that time, Monero traded at 0.00315 BTC and then dropped by -71.11% to 0.00091 BTC. XMR is still down -44.44% from October 3.This is what I said back then:This is still true in general.  Currently, Monero is #17 in terms of market capitalization. I am not the expert on cryptocurrency technicalities. I have heard that Monero seems to have some advantages over bitcoin. But to make this hold and manifest, much more awareness is needed.Even if Monero would be as good or even better than the other altcoins, just because it was not one of the first, it needs much more effort to overtake them..David Latapie mentioned to me the latest initiatives (new wallet, marketing task force), which I think is going into the right direction.The recent price rally could be the first inidication that things change for the good for Monero.It will be exciting to watch and bullbearanalytics will continue to cover Monero.[/color] Update December 27, 2014, #2.

Fundamentals are lagging.This is why it is best to make forecasts based on technical chart analysis and not fundamentals.Just look how foolish Tim Draper's bitcoin purchases are. He reads in mainstream media that bitcoin is the next big thing and he buys bitcoins first at around 600-700$ , losing half in value.He has been at least 1.5 years too late... after banking significant profits on the long = buy side before, our subscribers have now been able to bank significant profits following our short = sell trading idea: minimum 5% unleveraged profit, maximum 10% unleveraged profit. 2-3 times more profit if using leverage  Ripple UP more than Bitcoin UP Blitz, could not agree more.Most of the movements in bitcoin prices stem from speculation and investment into it. it's very similar to Gold. Adoption is not so much needed. Meaning, not 100% of the worlds population have to have golden bracelets or rings or earrings. It's enough that 1% hoard it or sell it = like central banks and funds and hedge funds auf welcher börse denn? :-) have a great weekend!And in the end, we all love bitcoin rallies (at least for those people who are long and not short) Hi Blitz,just stating the facts. It might not be perfect for everyone, but that's what is happening. #BitcoinBullBear subscribers move the market.Just after the new forecast alert for #bitcoin, $BTCUSD is up by 10 $http://bit.ly/1AANEDb #BitcoinBullBear subscribers move the market.

All time high This is an exciting comparison.I added Elliott Wave counts for both charts. And as one can see, the current rally is not 100% comparable to the one from last year. It rather looks like an a-b-c bounce, not the start of an impulsive rally.That said, It can still turn into one, and the next few weeks will tell.. wow, Ripple is rallying like crazy Indeed, often a too bullish sentiment is a contrarian indicator.In our forecast service, we integrate those sentiment measures to come up with the most probably bitcoin outlook. We are now entering crucial crossroads for bitcoin prices...Our analysts work 24/7, because the next weeks will be very hot very bullish sentiment currently in the poll above you are part of the majority at this point.Let's see how it continues The poll is up again.What is the bitcoin Sentiment out here?Curious.. ANNOUNCEMENT: We have a new, limited trial promotion for our bitcoin forecast:-40% off for the first month. This is valid until November 30 only.This forecast has continuously outperformed buy and hold and is up +1,662.93% since last year.See here: https://bullbearanalytics.com/bitcoin/ I agree with you that many traders lose money.However, there is hard data showing that about 1 out of 1000 traders are very successful and outperform the market by large margins - on day trading as well as more long term investing strategies Here is an update of our last forecast.Of note: We still have some slots left for people interested in becoming members of the subscription pool.

The reason is that this would be unfair to all the paying subscribers. Question to those interested in technical analysis:Which moving averages do you prefer to trade? yes there are efforts for manipulation all the time.but their impact mid and long term is negligible  exactly.There is no "manipulation" in real.It is just traders trying to maximize the price difference of buying and selling. Nothing more, nothing less.One can profit from a declining or rising price development - direction does not matter. ;-) Hey Jybrael, no need to flame anyone!Bitcoin prices are still in a mid term bear market since the 1200 $ high, so it is entirely possible to see more weakness. DIEM already above 200. big move for the small coin. could be getting more volatile , given the low liquidity- especially as there is almost no sell volume in orderbook Big news: Bitcoin accessible for "Average Joe" via credit card at Trucoin.com in many new states in the US.Good for bitcoin ecosystem.http://www.coindesk.com/trucoin-reenters-market-expands-bitcoin-buying-service-32-us-states/ As a recap: In July, we said in our http://bitcoinbullbear.com  forecast newsletter that the stop for short term positions is 539$. Since then, $BTCUSD is down -44%
Update October 3, 2014. Bitcoin (short position closed at 377 $. 22 $ gained per BTC). Added minor bitcoin long positionCurrent Asset Allocation88% Cash (USD)6% Gold5% Stocks SHORT (S&P 500, NDX, both 10x leveraged, started at 2012 S&P 500, in profit, stop lowered to 1951)0.5% Bitcoin0.3% Monero0.2% DIEM (as a "playground play", no serious fundamentals behind) 1. Almost all financial assets are in a decline globally; stocks, metals, bitcoin, altcoins. We are currently in a "risk off" period and risky assets are most affected.2. There is no big enough reason that XMR outperforms these other assets yet. XMR would need much more awareness and traction to make it outperform. And, ... there is absolutely no urgency to get back in. I may get in fast if I see a clear sell off and subsequent reversal or, I can take time and get back him when it is showing signs of an uptrend. But the worst thing in investing is to catch the falling knife. After protencting gains above 1000 $, it is not a big deal to buy back in at 400, 500, or 600. It is still outperforming buy and hold big time.  you are right. it is actually less than 0 , because I hold a net short position (-1.5% of portfolio short BTC) I am closely watching XMR. That said, there has been a clear downtrend since 4 weeks, and I want to see at least a short term impulsive wave = trend up before adding more. good question: 1) Because I like blue, 2) Because there are colors offered in this forum, 3) Because it helps me find my posts better :-) Why is this so unbelievable?I dont understand why people are so surprised about that. BTCUSD is down about 70% from its high. It is a bear market. It's always better to follow unbiased technical chart analysis versus letting your emotions "bitcoin love" guide your investment or trading.I love bitcoin , too. But I have 0 bitcoins right now.

Hello everyone,I just wanted to let everyone know how excited I am about this partnership. This is going to be a means for the DIEM community to have a reap world lasting effect, through this dojo and their community. Not to mention the advertisement opportunity this is for The DIEM teams family of coins. With this being said I encourage everyone to donate to make this happen. I for one have been donating .111 worth of diem (46,098,642)to this foundation! I look forward to seeing this partnership happen and let DIEM prosper. There is a lot of competition in the altcoin world and to succeed with DIEM, the team must never rest to drive this to success.S3052 that's true, but DIEM needs follow through volume to avoid turning down again yes, now it seems that there are just 239 XMR worth of DIEM left to break through 100 and higher.

Good point on USD.I foresee two strategies to manage a USD collapse (which I think won't happen before mid 2015), but even if here is what I'd do:1) Move USD to CHF. CHF will most likely be the fiat currency to survive the longest. Since USD is liquid I can do this overnight.2) Move part of it into phyisical gold stored as a safe location, e.g. via http://www.safewealthgroup.com/ (I have no affiliation with them, but think this is one of the few possibilities at hand) Update 5.Assets September 21, 2014.85.3% Cash (USD)6% Gold5% Short Stocks (S&P 500)3.2% Bitcoin0.3% Monero0.2% DIEM (as a "playground play", no serious fundamentals behind)Added leveraged bitcoin long position at 406 $.

Good questionThe asset allocation discussed here is meant to be for liquid assets in the general sense. I recentely ended all life insurances and got them liquidated to cash . I also sold all remaining stocks over the past weeks.I keep a risk life insurance and the mandatory retirement plan from my work.I don't have real estate as prices are in a bubble and I'd buy real estate in a couple of years if I really want to.Also, real estate is different depending on your location .Hence, this is why my example allocation is build on liquid assets and one that could work globally.And I have nothing under the mattress. Cash is sitting in the (so far) safest banks.  Exited the BTC long position at 418.35  I think it has been a temporary bottom. I currently see an a-b-c bounce up. If it does not turn into an impulsive 5-wave move, we may see a breach of the lows in the next days. I raised my stop to 385 $. you forget that I distributed a lot of coins via donations along the way and bitcoinica hack
percentage wise this is closeagain, no comment on any absolutes as I stared with much smaller amounts pffft forget it. I wont tell you any absolute numbers. I also dont need to know if and how rich you are.Fact is that I outperformed B&H by factor 1.5-2.0.Orders of magnitude is wrong as I mistyped this and corrected it already in the original thread. [/quote]Not concerned about that at all. It's the accuracy of your claims I'm concerned about. especially the ones about outperforming buy and hold. If one reads the title of your sub thread and your comments within it, one would think you've never made a trading mistake on the way up from $0.60  to $1200. If true, you should be richer than the many buy and holders who have indeed become rich over the same time period. [/quote]Noone is perfect and neither me.I have had losers as well in BTC trading, no doubt. What is accurate is the outperformance vs. buy and hold and getting out at 1100-1175. Since then, did only short term trades, no position trades any more. Will get back in if the technical picture warrants it. Thanks much!In fact I moved cash to BTC today around 390 for a brief trade with stop at 379.And moved another cash portion to short S&P 500 (2012) and Nasdaq 100 (4107) Guys you are how we in German say "Korinthenkacker". 1175 was the top and the selling range was 1100-1175 if it is so important to you.>>logictense My method was to store BTC in cold wallets and only briefly put them on bitfinex or stamp for selling and withdrawing thereafter. It worked. You are right in most aspects except of one.People who have sold at 1200 $ like me did not need to be stuck at mtgox. bitfinex was running smoothly at the time and withdrawals were smooth as well.[/quote]So then you should be richer than rich having sold a100% BTC portfolio @$1200 after having successfully navigated all the twists and turns on the way up from $0.60. [/quote]Not sure why you are concerned about my "richness" or lack of.I am very happy.Believe it or not, I did sell a lot between 1100 and 1200.  You are right in most aspects except of one.People who have sold at 1200 $ like me did not need to be stuck at mtgox. bitfinex was running smoothly at the time and withdrawals were smooth as well. It is rather: All risk on assets DOWN. Cash UP.this is why I started this thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=781957.msg8891629#msg8891629 5$ is quite likely to be touched by Silver in the next 2 years Update 3.Assets September 19, 2014.85% Cash (USD)6% Gold5% Short Stocks (S&P 500)3.5% Bitcoin0.3% Monero0.2% DIEM (as a "playground play", no serious fundamentals behind) nope, at least its below the line at the moment Has this become an Alibaba thread, or a lawsuit thread.I thought it was about BTC price movements. Great questions!First, timing is the most difficult to forecast. Price is easier. Along those lines, the S&P 500 will crash at least to a lower low than in 2009 in USD terms. Quite probably it will fall even lower into the 100 point range. In terms of timing, I'd give a range between 2016 and 2017.We will keep trying to narrow down the timing in the forecasting work we do.Second, when moving out of USD? I will probably move a high percentage into physical hold and silver stored in a safe location like at safe store from safewealth.com. And only keep the needed cash in local currencies to survive and buy food. 2.Assets September 18, 2014.89% Cash (USD)6% Gold4% Short Stocks (S&P 500)0.5% Bitcoin0.3% Monero0.2% DIEM (as a "playground play", no serious fundamentals behind) Blitz,well said!On MtGox, I lost some, but it was minor - because indeed I switched most to Stamp before. Where I lots a lot was bitcoinica.  My personal outperformance was 1.5-2x vs. buy and holding bitcoins.BitcoinBullbear.com forecast performance tracking can be found on the website.And from now on, you can track my portfolio performance live here in this thread.Since the start, bitcoin is down as predicted and thats why I only keep 1%. What are you trying to prove here? As I mentioned, when BTC were worth much less, I donated a lot to good projects and lost some during hacks and exchange closures. This is why the real numbers are nowhere near your numbers and I need to work hard everyday. correction. not orders of magnitudes, but 1.5-2x better than B&H. And also recognize that there were hacks and losses due to MtGox and bitcoinica going down. It seems like there is confusion.I have never and will also not here disclose my wealth to anyone.But yes, I have outperformed buy and hold with bitcoin by orders of magnitude :-) and this led to a very sizable absolute gain. This is now re-invested into other areas.But this thread is about a percentage example portfolio approach. Blitz, hows life? Long time no "see". I just realized it has been five years since we started here..!And indeed, you are right. It is not abou clinging to BTC just because we love it. It is solely about how to best trade it. And apart from some short term opportunities, I do not see any reason to hold or accumulate BTC unless certain technical criteria will have been met.
agree with all of the above except the comment of "hot air".The forecast service builds on in depth analysis and continuously outperforms buy and hold.But this is not to advertise the forecasting service, it's about seriously protecting wealth in the next years.Those who don't see the risk and those who dont want any forecast, do not need to follow or read this thread. thanks much! yes, correct. This is my approach. I keep 1% in BTC and wait for buying more at a clear upward breakout or seeing a more panic-style bottom. We cover the proper timing for a bigger BTC allocation 24/7 here: http://bit.ly/1qUp4qN. Unfortunately I am not rich...We are talking a couple of thousands here, but more importantly, the point of this is to show the allocation in percentages, so that rich or less rich people can scale it to their needs.About why no more BTC? I had close to 100% a while ago. But since the 1200 $ top, I went out. I will go in again when I judge the time is right. For bitcoin forecasts, please refer to http://bit.ly/1qUp4qN. To be fair to the huge subscriber pool, we cannot publish the forecasts here.In general, bitcoin may be stronger than many other assets, but since it is also a speculative vehicle, it may get affected by the ongoing and worsening flight to cash - as people may need to liquidate a lot of assets to pay their bills or cover losses in other assets.Hope this helps you. Because i) Cryptos have the second mover disadvantage. Bitcoin has the first mover advantage and unless bitcoin runs into a major problem, wil always be stronger longterm. Just look at Coke. First mover and always ahead of Pepsi, despite unrelentless attempts of Pepsi to take over market leadership.ii) Most cryptos do not have a big enough competitive advantage or differentiation to overcome barrier i)iii) Monero might gain more traction and that's why I hold themWhich ones do you suggest. I am happy to get convinced depending on your arguments. NEW: Asset allocations published:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=781957.new#new This is to share that I will publish my real asset allocation live here in a regular basis. I do this as it might be helpful to see for people who also agree that we are just before a major financial turbulence.My hypotheses are:1) Stocks will crash by 2016 and will mark new 15-20 year lows.2) Precious metals will survive better but will also decline first before rallying strongly. It is key to own physical precious metal, not paper certificates.3) The US Dollar will initially fare better against other currencies (particularly against the EUR), but then crash as well and may disappear in its current form by 2017-2018.4) Overall asset prices and prices of goods will decline = we are in a unprecedented deflation.You don't have to agree to this view. Most of these views are also similar to those offered on www.bullbearanalytics.com, but this specific thread is solely based on my personal point of view.Assets September 14, 2014.90% Cash (USD)6% Gold2% Short Stocks (S&P 500)1% Bitcoin0.8% Monero0.2% DIEM (as a "playground play", no serious fundamentals behind) Here is an update on how the trading ideas for cryptocoins / altcoins fared: All profitable.New forecast coming soon.

thanks. looks bullish at the moment why is DIEM trading FROZEN again on poloniex? Agree with you.This was nothing special. Price followed the parallel trendchannel we covered at www.bitcoinbullbear.com perfectly and the margin calls did not lead to unusual trading.As you said, this is part of trading. That's why its called trading and not long jump. Man kann so weit gehen und sagen dass TA sogar in diesen Zeiten mit niedrigem volumen funktioniert:Sogar in Deinem Besipiel Bitfinex. Klar wurden stops / margin calls ausgelöst vor ein paar Tagen. Und dennoch, der Presi fand genau im exakt parallelen Trendkanal unterstützung...: agree.Technically, the downtrend is broken to the upside and the order book looks bullish.Fundamentally, the DIEM coin team needs to continue convincing people why DIEM has a right to win among the 500 other cryptocoins..

New facebook site:Feel free to share and follow:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bitcoin-Bull-Bear/366379150160002 Sounds reasonable. I agree that you need funding to promote the coin. There is fierce competition and the risk is that DIEM gets forgotten soon. This is why you should find ways to communicate to the community and investors the benefit of DIEM over other coins.The torture test is always to ask someone who is not part of the team: Would you want this coin? Would you buy it? I for myself, did not grasp why I should hold DIEM and not one of the other 500 coins.I am happy to jump into the IRC in some point, but no time today.CARPEDIEM! Destroying the coins would not only be better for short but also for long term development of DIEM.Reducing coin supply will drive up prices.Adding coins will lead to declines.If new investors wanted to get into DIEM coins they can just buy them on the exchanges, they do not need another IPO. I am afraid the objective is wrong. Keeping price stable will not help enough. The coin needs to GROW. If there is no growth = price rise, noone will be interested any more. either of it could the case.but I am not sure about the definition  of "HUGE SELL WALL". the 445 LTC sell wall is equivalent to about 5k $. If there was serious interest for investors to hold DIEM, taking out this sell wall would be a piece of cake. and.. try to get some long term investors in. given the low market cap, if you get a few bigger investors in who will be longterm holders, DIEM price could explode up to create demand you will first need a UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITIOn.Try to answer the questions:1. What is unqiue to DIEM?2. Who should someone bother to get into it?3. What is the benefit to purchase DIEM coins vs. other cryptocoins? = why is DIEM coin better than others?if you have answers to this, you can start communicating this message  market manipulation with walls will not help long term.what you need to do is creating demand for DIEM, so that price goes up sustainably.doing an IPO will actually create more downward pressure since it increases the number of open market coins sorry for my lack of understanding. I still dont get the situation.What do you mean "The benefit of keeping them is we basically have a whale backing us that doesn't need to necessarily make a profit"? what is the benefit of keeping them?what is the downside of destroying them if noone claims them? so whats the plan to drive diem forward? any news? good that you communicate.that said, you should be more specific and communicate a deadline and then stick to it. this is the simple but magic formula in PR :-) that`s great to know. Hence, trading remains uninterrupted I guess. How it the order book affected? I.e. at Poloniex, will existing orders all be cancelled or will they be transferred to the new DIEM coin order book? I agree. its beautiful thanks. very clear. can you tell me how many coins have been mined to date.what is the market cap of DIEM? for people who want flexible subscriptions, we offer numerous options 1 month3 months6 months12 months, etcWe don't think it is fair to only offer 6m premium subscriptions, but we rather think if our service remains very good, people will continue without putting chains on them for 6 or 12 months from the start. Bitcoin Bull Forecasting Service has been upgraded for existing subscribers
hello everyone:where is a link to a statistics of DIEMCOIN? like number of coins mined to date, market cap, etc.? Not sure you understand fully technical analysis. The 2nd forecast option materialized almost exactly as predicted:USDe fell through the trendline and hit our target zone 100-120, which was supposed to hold the decline as strong support. The low was 103.Hence, as a trader, you could have placed a stop around 155-158 and bought back in in the 100-120 zone.By the way, in technical analysis, the most important thing is to identify possible trading paths of 2-3 lead options. You will never be 100% right on lead route and probabilities, but you can trade all lead alternatives if you have a predefined trading path, like the one mentioned above. coverage of DIEMhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=529493.msg6419845#msg6419845 Brief coverage of technical analysis and forecast of DIEM, using DIEM/LTCTwo forecast options:1) Breakout of bull flag (probability 60:40).

Some of you might be interested in at least a trial membership of the bitcoin forecast premium.bitcoinbullbear.com Brief update as some people asked for it.Our subscribers were fully prepared of a break down per yesterday's update when bitcoin prices were at 544 $:"whether the pennant is extending or if the downtrend has overpowered the pattern and support at 380 - 400 $ would need to be tested", "At this point, the chart is pointing to lower prices from here".This morning, bitcoin prices hit 400 $ at BitStamp - a 30% decline.  Great idea! It's almost funny. We already forecasted the 1000$ price when bitcoin prices were under 30$ years ago and many of our subscribers of bitcoin bull bear are now millionaires.I am sure we can again forecast if and when bitcoin charts show again 1000$ , 10000$, or more - or, 100$, 10$ or less
Dear BitCoinNutJobWe are sorry to hear that you did not profit enough from the bitcoin bull bear forecast.Please let us know what specifically you have in mind why you did not achieve what you wanted in bitcoin trading.Dear AllIt is normal that not everyone is happy with analyses and forecasts. It also depends on individual trading skills and also money management.And again the last updates were spot on. Prices turned at exactly the forecasted levels .We also know that loyal , satisfied subscribers don't usually go to forums like this and "defend" anything.And this is why we continuously monitor the feedback and our survey from 2 weeks shows that we have 89.6% satisfied subscribers.We always try to improve and will continue  If only a tiny part if this is true, MtGox should be raided by the police immediately and shut down  Die Charttechnik dominiert... es bring leider wenig auf Ausbrüche zu hoffen, oder zu glauben dass einzelne Markteilnehmer den Kurs massgeblich in eine Richtung bringen können.Bitcoin ist mittlerweile zu gross dazu und einzig und allein die Massenpsychologie bestimmt den Kurs. There is technical analysis creating bitcoin forecasts that work well love it It's still a wild west situation with bitcoins..: here another example:MtGox still claims on the main home page that they are the world's largest exchange. Normally, competitors would be challenging this within days after this is not true any more.. but they dont even bother..wild west, indeed."Trade with confidence on the world's largest Bitcoin exchange!MtGox is the world's most established Bitcoin exchange. You can quickly and securely trade bitcoins with other people around the world with your local currency!" We can confirm that all subscribers have received the latest update.Please check your spam folder in case you dont have it in your normal inbox, depending on your spam settings.But it is all correct on our end. Vphen just confirmed it to me send me a PM with your email address you used to subscribe and we can check  are you an active subscriber? New short term update just sent to subscribers, also including more details about our MtGox decision. Now even 615 $ .. falling further.. very nice Can I ask you a question, please?For how long have you been trading any financial market regularly?As said, we have a 90%+ satisfaction rate from our subscribers, over already 3 years. And bitcoinbullbear.com has been outperforming the buy and hold strategy massively throughout this time.I do not want to put you on the spot too much, but can it be that you are not so experienced in trading and money management? Let us know if you need some help on that. We did that before with subscribers and they were very happy about it.And finally, here is yet another example of the accuracy of our forecast from yesterday:Lead forecast: 1. "Short term trend: DOWN"2. "Very short term trend DOWN"3. "Put all of this together and we continue to think the market could press lower to test the 550 to 620 $ range" This was when BTCUSD was at 652.85 $. As of this minute, BTCUSD is at 621 $. This means, you could have made 31 $ per bitcoins sold or shorted. Not bad for 24 hours...It can be that simple  As mentioned before, there are many types of different investors and traders.Our most recent subscriber survey tells us that 90% of subscribers are satisfied with our current service. There will always be a few individuals who want something else.That said, we are very happy about your feedback and will continue to improve and innovate. Also, a new weekly bitcoin forecast has just been issued to subscribers.Trial subscriptions for 20% discount are still available here: http://bitcoinbullbear.com/ The poll is reset for your voting again.Up?Down?Same?for the next 4 weeks https://digitalcurrencyresearch.com/ and http://bitcoinbullbear.com/ has just moved to bitstamp as leading market for bitcoin charts and bitcoin forecasts.We abandon MtGox until further notice and possibly foreever. Good bye. Team - you are right: There are times when it is warranted to provide tighter trading ideas and ranges, and there are times when it is best to protect people from getting caught in random bitcoin price swings.That said, for example, the latest report from February 5 was again dead on with a forecast for bitcoin price declines: "there appears to be little support to the downside.. 60/40 probability down". This was when BTCUSD was at 835$ at MtGox, and now it is at 674$.There are always some people who complain about things, but the overwhelmingly positive feedback from 90+% of our subscribers tell us that we are on track.That said, we will soon offer new feedback and service opportunities for subscribers - as we always strive to innovate and improve services. You are right.It is best to think about it in the metaphor of waves:There are certain times where there is no wind and there only tiny waves. This makes trading largely unprofitable due to the spread and slippage and false signals. And there are a lot of periods with strong moves where trading can be a stormy paradise.Good analysis and forecasts follow this principle: Stay neutral in the no-wind times and give clear directions in stormy times.And: The stable period will soon be over, and subscribers of www.digitalcurrencyresearch.com will be the first to know when we think it's going to happen, and in which direction. thanks so much for the clarification and feedback. +1
I like this idea.On our end, I will talk with the team about writing it on http://coinconsultancy.com/In the meanwhile, I tweeted:https://twitter.com/BitcoinAnalyst Yes, very short term trading requires a lot of experience and skills beyond having a forecast - especially in the volatile bitcoin market. We continue to stress that.That said, also the short term forecasts have a very high accuracy. Here is the recent example from Thursday, Jan 10, 2014 - when BTCUSD was 943 $ at MtGox:We said: "Given this picture, and the fact that the market has held 900 $ level on the last few small selloffs means that the market could continue up to resistance at 1000 $ but it looks unlikely that the momentum and conviction are there to take it up to or past the previous 1093 $ high". What happened then is that bitcoin prices indeed hit the target of 1,000 $ (intraday 1023 $) and then turned down again. This is a pretty decent forecast and short term traders could have made at least +57 $ = +6% within less than 48 hours. But as mentioned many times before, winning in bitcoin and any other market in short term or day trading requires more than an accurate forecast. There is at least an equal weight of proper discipline, experience and money management.  As an exception, I give an answer here:As long as the April 2013 high holds (266 $), we are bullish longterm to at least one more ATH above 1242 $.Please understand that other comments and forecasts, as well as shorter term predictions will only be available in the subscriber section. It would otherwise be unfair to paying subscribers. The technicals always supersede the fundamentals.Hence, it wont help to frantically issue updates just because of news. In fact, the bitcoin chart patterns are more important. Very often, the same sort of news produce different effects. Depending on the position of bitcoin prices within the larger chart pattern, a "positive" news can one time lead to a rally and another time to a sell off - and vice versa.This forecast is using technical analysis as base and not fundamentals. Nothing is ever perfect, but the overwhelmingly positive feedback from our subscribers shows that we serve customers well - and help them to strongly outperform buying and holding bitcoins. And this remains our goal.The history of the 4 years of bitcoinbullbear service proves that our forecast accuracy is >85%, no matter what the "news" are.In any case, no one pushes anyone to subscribe. It is people's choice. We continue to offer the 20% off special trial promotion in January. Available at https://digitalcurrencyresearch.com/ Sorry about that!  We never received the email, which is worrying.  I'll check to make sure everything is working properly in that regard.  I have replied to you PM as well.  Thanks for inquiry, we hope to see you aboard!Have a great BITday! agreewhat's the status? thank you very much for your questions. Here the brief answers:1) Yes, the predictions are more than 85% correct. And if people followed our forecast, they would have made much more profit than buy and hold.2) We focus mainly on technical analysis, but we always also observe the fundamental developments and integrate them in our overall assessment as appropriate.We have a special trial offer for one month of the bitcoinbullbear forecast so you can try it out:https://digitalcurrencyresearch.com/sign_up/bitcoin-bull-bear/?currency=BTC good observation.what do others think? The poll has been reset for you.Vote now: Up?Down?Same? Markets move in waves / cycles.

No worriesI am ready to get back in digital currency, either between 700-800 or above 1250 Let's see.We are definitely seeing the consolidation / correction from the ~1250 $ top as per last forecastAnd personally I am out of bitcoins now When prices were at 100 $ in May 2013, our forecast was a rally to at least 320 $, with further upside into round numbers of 500 $ and 1000 $.. forecast update issued last night.. and again it materializedwe continue to offer a special trial month offer for a limited period of time here: https://digitalcurrencyresearch.com/ new forecast available for subscribers Top or not is the question we always address in the key financial markets - beyond bitcoin also precious metals and global stock indices just in case someone wants to contact the bitfinex people? anyone has their phone numbers or addresses?quote from their community infohttps://community.bitfinex.com/content.php/31-Team-change"Bitfinex will continue its development toward a regulated trading platform, complying with all necessary regulations for the safety of your funds, with the current team of Jean-Louis VAN DER VELDE (legal development) http://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-HK/members/114736202/, Giancarlo DEVASINI (customer relationship and financial advising) http://hk.linkedin.com/pub/giancarlo-devasini/82/646/2a5, my wife (technical development) and me (technical development), helped behind the curtains by awesome external developers that will soon change the face of our platform.If you have any questions as always you can ask in the comments.Best regardsRaphaelBitfinex team" we don't need f...

But now, sentiment fell to a "normal" (for bitcoin) 60-70% range which could be an indication that the uber - bullish people got out again and there is more room to rally since weak hands have been eliminated.

danke Klaus. die regelmässige uebersicht ist klasse You are right. The only reason I can see for people to stick with them is to believe / pray that they can keep this 10$ advantage.But the exchange volume inversion from 80% mtgox to a lead of the other exchanges proves that most people are switching  +1Ich denke wenn die AfD über 5% kommt, gibts morgen ein erstes volatiles Gemetzel an der Börse...Die auswirkungen der makroökonimischen und fiskalpolitischen bewegungen auf bitcoin sind immer noch sehr begrenzt.. aber sehen wir mal was die naechsten 48h bringen da stimme ich voll zu. ist gängige PR taktik wenn eine firma probleme hat As an example, this one is on its way to cover data from all exchanges and even allow trading and arbitrage on all those exchanges from one single platformhttps://www.trucoinrt.com/ I agree with you.There is no fundamental reason to stick with mtgox and the price is inflated due to the default riskIt is easy to leave: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1493.msg3208216#msg3208216 an deiner erklärung ist auf jeden fall was wahres dranim übrigen ist es mir und kann es uns ganz egal sein welche exchange überlebt oder nicht - solange es immer exchanges gibt die sicher und legal sind.dennoch ist mtgox auf dem absteigenden ast. und obwohl die ausschläge bei volatilität bei mtgox immer noch höher als bei anderen sind, sind die absoluten ausschläge immer kleiner.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=182568.msg3206174#msg3206174ich sehe daher weiterhin ein grosses risiko dass mtgox in der versenkung verschwindet, wenn sie nicht schnell ihre kommunikation und angebote verbessern.für mich und für die community gibt es eigentlich überhaupt keinen grund, weitehin auf mtgox zu traden (ausser die menschliche trägheit zu wechseln):  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1493.msg3208216#msg3208216 langsam dahinsiechend... And here a guideline for subscribers and others addressing the MtGox withdrawal issue:If you really want to withdraw fiat, there is no need to bother with MtGox anymore:Here the easy steps:1) You could buy BTC at MtGox2) Withdraw those BTC to another platform, i.e. bitfinex3) Sell BTC on this platform / exchange to fiat4) Withdraw fiat easily.The whole operation should take approx 4-5 days. This is how it worked for me with bitfinex or bitstamp. International wires in all amounts approx 3 days on bitfinex. Here is the current consolidated orderbook view across all key exchanges sorry, but I still don't get it.If you really want to withdraw fiat, why do you bother with MtGox?You could buy BTC at MtGox, withdraw them to another platform, and then withdraw fiat easily. the whole operation should take approx 4-5 days. This is how it worked for me with bitfinex or bitstamp. i just contacted them and will share the answer when I get it got it. let me see if i can get a referrer cose bitcoin ist (noch) zu winzig um von den "normalen" finanzmarktkapriolen tangiert zu werden I may misunderstand you, but cant you just register there?here is also the contact: contact@bitfinex.com I don't see the issue at all with MtGox withdrawals anymore (yes I am over-simplyfying). There are a few other exchanges where withdrawals work almost instantly, my best experience it with bitfinex. All withdrawals processed within 3 days. I had at least 10 of them in the past 3 months.It could be that simple: Buy some BTC at MtGox, withdraw BTC, send to another exchange... and MtGox is history... this is why bitcoinbullbear avoids emotions  973 left... 1000 btc was probably already whale food (plankton) .. eaten away... the litecoin pattern looks more bullish than the bitcoin chart pattern right now. 
probably this thread could merge into an overall orderbook and wall trackerbitstamp has more volume now and there is one 3000 btc bid wall left. if this falls.. good night bitcoin for a deeper fall  the 1000 $ question is very interesting. however, this will most probably not happen in the next few weeks.The more important questions, and of course this is my point of view, are rather:Will Bitcoin charts show a bitcoin price below $100, $80, or even $40 again in the next days or few weeks?orWill we see a break out above $140-160?This is something we analyse constantly in our service. Yes, we charge a fee for that. But the great feedback from subscribers shows that people new to bitcoin trading in particular see this as excellent help to navigate the market. We give probabilities to each scenario and the track record beats buy and hold by 700%.And, we offer a 70% off promotion until early October for a trial month for only 0.075 bitcoin. Here is a Bitcoin Bull Bear Special Offer, One Month ~$9.95 (0.075btc)! Limited Time Only!We are excited to announce a very special offer for a limited time only (exp. 10/1/2013) in which new subscribers can take advantage of a one month ActivePro trial for the exceptionally low price of ~$9.95, or 0.075btcclick here: http://bit.ly/15Dt6ta Well stated.It is great when the Technical Analysis is in line with Fundamental Analysis ThanksThis article is a great analysis  Well , frankly I was interested to hear some thoughts of the community about either side Why have people clicked that prices go up and what do those think who clicked that prices go down ? Yes we have models.No they don't cost anythingYes we collect fees because people value accurate forecasts for their trading Volume will come back in the next few weeks based on our model. Exciting times ahead for bitcoin charts...! >61% bullish sentiment. Does it mean prices will rally from here or crash? was willste trinken ;-), jetzt wo wir 1:0 fuehren nach deinem traumpass perhaps because they have seen that this call was right :-) sorry, couldn't resist bragging   yes, prices sub 10 $ will probably not exist for a very long time nice one  and yes, single digits for Silver to come where do you find me saying that there is only one entity?  it seems that the market is falling on its own weight. and the manipulation to keep the price at 140+ is not very successful agree.. and I think I know where it is going... perhaps even moving earlier than next week Range bound bitcoin prices are in line with our bitcoinbullbear.com forecastWe will alert subscribers when we think a breakout or breakdown is near or confirmedNew subscribers can still join at -20% reduced trial offers They also failed to process any of my EUR and CHF withdrawals. thanks & sent This is no joke.The customer is always the number one priority in our philosophy. Egoistic goals and business success comes thereafter.
It's not about me but about helping making our subscribers richer Noone is obliged to follow technical analysis But for those who want better results than buy and hold , they are invited to try the technical analysis for bitcoin.The bitcoinbullbear service has outperformed buy and hold by orders of magnitudes over 3 years consistently  James,it is great that you remind people about the claims. Thank you for that.I am still waiting for an answer on my claim from qpage@mylawyr.com about the bitcoin payment address.Can you help out?thanks great ideas and questions where is her picture :-)  ? does anyone have a source for bitstamp charts and orderbooks? the one on bitcoincharts.com does not work anymore A less greedy solution is withdrawing BTC or if you have USD: buying BTC at mtgox and then in both cases withdraw all BTC from them. Those BTCs could then be put in safe storage and the risk of losing them is much lower than leaving them at Mtgox in my pov its a low sample size , but sentiment is bullish at 60% that's great background.the only way that MtGox will change their behavior would be if most customers would leave them completely, trading volume falls below 1000 and then 100 BTC per day...but as long as so many people keep their funds there, they can carry on with this nontransparent communication definitely, LTC trading has gained more and more attention and there is much more room for litecoin trading volume to grow, and spreads to narrow Sentiment indicator confirms forecast.The poll is reset again!thank you for your votes new short term analysis issued to subscribers: Caution this is no ad, just a response to the discussions about short term forecasts very accurate short term predictions are available onhttps://digitalcurrencyresearch.com/ +1 From mid July when prices were in the 90s:"First target is 104.17 $ on MtGox (preferably on a confirmed 3-­‐day sustained move above 100 $), followed by a move back to the June high of 134.73  $". Yes, but its worth it www.digitalcurrencyresearch.com the real cause are simply the technical bitcoin chart patterns as we predicted weeks ago in bitcoinbullbear The bitcoinbullbear report covers bitcoin charts and bitcoin forecasts for all time frames.It gives you support and resistance values that you can use to protect your position.https://digitalcurrencyresearch.com/
^This there are always times of high and low volume cycles. if fiat would be drying up too much, BTCUSD would not risevolume in both, fiat and BTC will rise again massively I don't try to pick on you personally.But this point of view shows exactly why there is much more upside with bitcoin in general. Sentiment is too pessimistic. Not enough people are LONG yet for a reversal.The trend is your friend. Dont look at fundamentals, but at technical analysis. the charts say everything. Thanks to you for the feedback!And it's rally time again for bitcoin...Key support and resistances for the next days are in the newsletter!Exciting times. makes a lot of senseand you can also see it that way:the less awareness it has, the more potential for a price rise bitcoin hasonce there is mass awareness, the sentiment will be too bullish and then price may be on a plateau or even correct= meaning technical analysis factors will LEAD the fundamental as it always has for bitcoin since we started to analyse it 3 years ago In case anyone like to subscribe, the subscription process is secure and very simple for you - fully automated.This also means that you can subscribe at any minute, hour, day you want - not just end of month like some other services  great meal:artificial bitburgers + Bitburger beer (German brand)  Will be interesting to order bitburgers... Wie wir es von bitcoin kennen: Überraschungen fast durchweg durch RalliesFür subscribers = Abonnenten gelten die Support / Résistance Levels von den Updates Und ein neues Update kommt wahrscheinlich heute Nacht. KlausDanke für deine treue! Wenn man "LONG" ist, definitiv geil.Wir von digitalcurrencyresearch.com sind long :-)Ihr auch? You can also request an invite yourself its entirely possible, just depends on the when...if it goes down before back to below 100 $ or notmore can be found out on https://digitalcurrencyresearch.com/ yes, or prices need to be quoted in satoshis.still, there needs to be some sort of "agreement" to be able to show prices differently in charts software, financial media, etc..who decides on the "split"? That is your very valid opinion.I agree to disagree with you.The system that they have build is not sustainable and will burst dramatically in the next years. we will see.lets wait for tonight's short term update! there is also the https://trucoinrt.com/ platform now which connects the biggest 3 exchanges in one umbrella platform. easy to trade in one-stop-shop current sentiment is mildly bullish: 54%See poll above  ran out of blue ink. Just bought some more with bitcoins :-) You are talking about the wrong asset.Bitcoin is not in a bubble.Stocks and precious metals are.
That's exactly the point.And even if all central banks have as number one priority to keep the stock market bubble alive, they can't prevent the bubble from popping big time eventually.And it will be very nasty.Dow jones 400 we are coming. this is just the beginning of major exchange issuesOnce the deflation is in full force, we will see more outages. when selling starts in earnest, NASDAQ, NYSE, etc. servers wont be able to handle it.it is like 100,000 people trying to escape out of a baseball or soccer stadium at once when only one gate is open... Gold is one of the final assets people will flee into. thats why it wont drop as far as othersSilver is 1) a speculative vehicle and 2) and more of an industrial metal than gold and will hence drop like a stone if deflation is in full force ok. here we go:Tulip bubble Japan housing bubble South sea stock Basically, a bubble is a irrational, exuberant rise and a crash to where it started.Bitcoin instead started at 0.01-0.06 $ and is still 1,000 - 10,000x higher today. June was nothing compared to now.In July, my withdrawals stopped being processed.Finally I bought bitcoins back and withdrew them. Goodbye mtgox.In the end its Easy. It does not really look like a bubble. yes.. and the should fall with the deflation rate.We are in deflation or soon will be globally. this makes a lot of sense Between 1000-800. My lowest estimate is 600. the best time to get out of gold was at about 1900 ...but there is soon another time coming to sell gold, before the big buy is warrantedUP. DOWN. UP big time thats too easy... come onPersonally, I believe that BTC will outperform most assets in the next 12 months. Is this clear enough? for significant periods of time, yes.but I am also referring to the BTCUSD rate only at this stage, and in some point the USD will be far weaker. Net, even if both fall, as the USD should fall harder, BTCUSD will rise.But again, we will analyse all this on a daily / weekly basis as noone can predict the next years exactly today. some things will change along the way that require to verify / adjust the forecast frequently.  you have a great point, definitely.However, it all depends on your time horizon.One thing I learned painfully over the first years of analyses and trading is that you should not assume certain market correlations hold forever. Instead you need to analyze each market separately, and only use the correlations with other assets as one out of many indicators.when it comes to the Bitcoin forecast I do not want to get into specifics here as this would be unfair to paying subscribers ( a new report will come out in the next 24 hours and I am sure it will be very interesting as something happens with BTCUSD).Net, there are different time frames and some of them warrant to be long bitcoins , even if in some point a bigger correction could come. But you can still sell then.. there are two effects with different impacts:1) the overall deflation of all assets which can also impact BTC as you suggested above2) bitcoins infancy with still huge potential. just imagine every citizen of the world would have 0.001 BTC... here an overlay (with different axis, still needed :-)) now we are onto something interesting..We never discussed about a SPLIT.Stocks are split regularly, but in BTC this does not really work. Any idea?If there is no split, BTCUSD will be like Warren Buffet's stock. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A). Current price 173,220.00 $ in any case, having a bank account in Japan could be worth arbitragemillions +1 Yes. That's a good one. +1000
LolIt's simple , my favorite color is blue and it is available here  That is an excellent reasoning.Fundamentally, there are high chances that bitcoin can further grow for another number of years - sometimes exponentially, sometimes linear, with corrections / consolidations along the way. If Japanese people are smart , they can bring the arbitrage gap down significantly:Buying BTC at bitstamp, bitfinex or other exchanges , then sell BTC at MtGox in JPY, and finally withdraw  JPY within Japan This is possible when looking at the nominal chart but the log chart shows something different  this is not a forecast. I said that if/when BTC would hit 1000$ we should carefully watch the public sentiment to judge whether there is more upside or whether we will see  a big correction first. perfect. thanks a lot Agree with you 100%.yes, this is true. I think initially bitstamp was 80% a funnel to withdraw BTC for users who cannot withdraw from MtGox.Once they moved BTC to bitstamp and once they saw strong BTC price development, they started to use bitstamp as their exchange http://bitcoin-analytics.com/on this site there is the option to see the all USD consolidated order book: go to depth and select allUSD (just for info. I do not have any relationship with this website)My point is that, to assess the entire bitcoin price direction using order depth, it may be best to look at the entire consolidated order book. yes, I wonder what the media says when bitcoin hits 1000$. perhaps they will again call a bubble or they say that next target is 10000$.If they say the latter, I'd be wary about a bubble. If it is the former, there is more upside.And on stocks, we can wait until the financial media calls for "sell stocks", because this will be close to the actual bottom. This may be around 400 for the dow jones industrials. yep: back to the topicI wonder how the results of the 11,34 cross over would look likeNo cross over yet on the 4h for this one sorry if this was not clearbitcoinbullbear covers all time frames. i did not mean his. We are covering all time scales from the longest term to the shortest term.I think the next steps are clear and I leave the pitch to Goomboo. thanks, notme.I agree that is was over-reacting by starting to do similar things that I criticize. I got too emotional and this is always wrong. It's not an excuse but there are people fully / partially living from the analysis and this is why it is business and not a hobby.We keep our thread focused on content, and if someone wants to do a notification thread it should go somewhere else as you suggested. yes, like the stock market is pumped up by the QE from the fed.Bitcoin is real. 100% agree. There is a positive correlation of ANY news, "positive" or "negative" with bitcoin prices. okThis is my last comment about cypherdocs's practices in this thread. As of then, I will tackle this differently and not drag "innocent" readers into it.My only point is that it is not required to bump threads with the "excuse" that subscribers need this alert. They get the analysis for his services by email and this is very instant. By the way, bitcoinbullbear does the same and none of of our subscribers have ever complained about that we need to bump threads to alert them. I am just asking for fairness, because the thread bumping creates a lot of awareness and if this is not stopped, we might need to do the same, but being customer focused and loving this forum, I really do not want to do it. Perhaps the moderators can add a pure notification section and move his thread there, because obviously he admitted that it is for this purpose only. His thread does not belong into the speculation thread. Do you see my point at least a little bit?Goomboo: sorry for this. I like your thread and it is great to keep discussing those moving average crossed which we also follow many of them in our analysis. So many people have predicted that bitcoin is in a bubble and is doomed to death.There are most often the same people who push stocks up into bubble territory.Now let's get to the bottom of this:1) Is Bitcoin in a bubble?Look at that longterm chart. Where is the bubble? I can't see it.The uptrend is healthy.2) What are REAL bubbles?The NASDAQ bubble has already popped 13 years agoThere are some new bubble stocks in there that either have already popped or will do soon (LNKD, PCLN, etc.)these are the real bubbleshow do other see that? Sorry for that.  That was not my intent. But as you can see in this specific thread, there are lots if people complaining about the bumps. Another one just minutes ago .I stay out of this as of now. It is an issue for the moderators and I am focusing on analysis and forecasts. We have two updates for you1. The special summer promotion for the bitcoin, stock market, precious metal, etc. forecasts is still open until August 19 (3 days left). Use code: bbbsummer for six weeks free with a 3 month (+) subscription on https://digitalcurrencyresearch.com/Also, we will soon add a new market as a surprise.2. The poll is reset if you want to express your opinion about bitcoin prices direction.have a great BitDay I will try to find a solution with cypherdoc and asked him to have a call with me. Because you are right, this daily bumping creates awareness for new potential customers (even if some people including me hate it as it woes not add value). Hence, it would be good to find an agreement to ideally limit posts that have no real content.
I'd live to have a call with you to talk this 1on1 with youI'd also like to maintain a friendly relationship with you.I am available every evening from Fri-Sun this weekend. Just let me know when you have 30 minutes. Thanks for those questions. They are absolutely valid :1) on the timing of talking about this: i have seen cypherdoc changing his position multiple times: first he tells me 1.5 years ago he wants to cover other markets ex bitcoin . Second he starts covering bitcoins some months later . Third he says about 3-6 months ago that he will never change his 2.5 BTC per month pricing even if he loses all subscribers as it is only his hobby . Fourth some weeks ago he drops his price which shows that he changed his mind and gets into the competitive position again. It is because of that recent development that I am also stepping up competitiveness.2) on the phone conversation: no one can prove what was said and like you said it is a great learning for me. I was too naive believing into what he said holds true. Believe me I am not that stupid. If I had the perception that he would start doing a paid bitcoin analysis service like me I would never have agreed to talk with h on the phone. Anyway I am not fearing competition as we at DCR continue to serve our clients in the best way we can and we want to keep extending our clear market leadership as most followed service.Anyway, as I said it is my fault but I am still disappointed about cypherdocs practices . The world is dishonest and money / capitalism rules everything - very unfortunately.On the positive side, bitcoin P2P system is honest and that is why I continue to support it. I love bitcoin. To clarify as there is a misunderstanding :1) he did not copy any of the content of the analysis2) what happened is that he asked me to explain in depth how to set up a subscription model and process. We had  a 60-90 minutes Skype call where he asked all questions about it and i answered them in good faith since I (wrongly ) assumed that he won't start to cover bitcoin My mistake. this is not a promotion. it is just stating the facts that people can use various exchange. And to date, MtGox is still the largest.It still holds true that my account at MtGox is 0 BTC, 0 fiat. As I said below 10 $ will probably happen between 2014-2016, not now.Patience It's definitely sleek. Let's just make sure customers get the facts :1) they have a right to understand that there is a great bitcoin and other financial market analysis service out there that costs almost 50% less than yours. This is a public thread and this is why it is possible to mention it here2) I shared all the insights and even my template with you when you were about to start your service. At that time, you said that you will only cover other markets excluding bitcoin. Then you started it and added bitcoin , competing with us against your initial plan. If I knew you would cover bitcoin upfront, I would have never helped you getting your business off the ground. Now you may say that you wouldn't have needed it, but I am disappointed about the lack of honesty.I am happy to continue this conversation privately if you wish.Anyway, I wish you all the best for the future as we are both bitcoin lovers and competition is always good. You can try out bitcoinbullbear.com by digitalcurrencyresearch.comWith historical performances and 50% more attractive prices instead: 0.55 BTC per month  low amounts at bitstamp and bitfinex. It works smoothly, e.g. Withdrawals always within 2-3 days.But I don't risk the farm because I am not sure about their security and regulatory status I have cancelled all withdrawals  as none of them went through for 3 months.Back into BTC, then all BTC withdrawn yesterday out of MtGox and now I am done with them.For me mtgox is dead as of today. it has been quite painful in the past to try to pick any bitcoin charts tops...It's a long term bitbullmarket great, thanks bitcoin :-) that the point. Correct if I read this well, this model does not outperform buy and hold: only +643%our newsletter has fared better :-) (had to throw this in :-)) this looks weird. are you sure this is right?i.e. what happens if it crossed intrady?is the cross over calculated based on intraday or closing prices?how far back have you tested it? Well, if the consensus is that it won't help the majority of bitcoiners , I will hold off with the complaint. It is sad indeed that mthoax screwed this up so much.And personally, I am happy with what I have done. I have most of my funds secured safely in may when I sold most if my bitcoins . I am not banking much on existing exchanges as they all seem to have risks I am just talking about principles. Not at all. I will be doing this as a matter of principle.I have 95% of my funds all secured in proper accounts or in cold storage. I have some silver orders to be filled by 2016 at 4-5$ and I am positive...
weekly newsletter is out to subscribers Thanks a ton for that.I will also file a complaint with the SEC, and then close my account at MtGox , too.I have been with them since September 2010. What do you mean ?  makes sense I am not an expert on security and regulations regarding exchanges, but I tend to agree with what you mentioned above. The only thing I'd add is bitfinex.comI have used them for 7 months now for BTC trading, BTC margin trading, LTC trading, etc. They have mentioned somewhere that they have registered themselves in HongKong with the financial authorities.Withdrawals works extremely fast and smoothly as well.And.. they offer all possible orders: stop loss, stop buy, stop sell, etc. and by the way, bitstamp seems to be leading price now (as discussed in the subscriber section) why not my friend. you are welcome to join as always I have done the same and its fine now using other exchanges like bitstamp and bitfinex ( by the way , I am not associated with those in any way, just observing and trying to find the best solution in this MtGox fiasco ) Genauso ..Das Pendel schwingt zu bitstamp (Und um es klarzustellen: Ich habe keine Beziehung zu bitstamp, sondern analysiere die Sachlage ohne bias) Nice try :-)Only subscribers get the detailed forecast and most typically the predicted trend materializes , which seems to be also supported by the trading activity of the big subscriber crowd  I agree. With every piece of communication they erode my trust further finally MtGox is trying to react with PR statements, but still, based on my own experience nothing moves really smoothly in terms of withdrawals. I cancelled mine after 5 weeks of false promises from MtGox. the increasingly better technicals on bitstamp could be driven by the fact that by now, enough traders moved left mtg and moved to bitstamp and now start actively trading there - and not only use bitstamp as withdrawing funnel A comment on the MtGox situation and recent developmentThis is a great business case study.Chapter 1:The first bitcoin exchange founded by Jed Caleb, running it from the start with passion for great customer satisfaction. It is growing massively. There were some technical issues, but they always got solved.Chapter 2:Mark Kapeles buys MtGox. Luckily for him, bitcoin takes off in the public and exchange volume rises. He is happy.Chapter 3:He does not seem to be as passionate and dedicated to customer service as the MtGox founder which leads to a lot of frustration. Hacks happen, security breaches, etc. MtGox is not innovating at all: The website and exchange options are as they were 2-3 years ago... Still today, there are no stop loss, stop buy, trailing orders, etc. something that many exchanges have and something that would also lead to better customer satisfaction and more volume for the exchange..Chapter 4: The lack of innovation, bad marketing, PR and customer service leads to lower customer trust.Chapter 5: The attempts of complying with money service regulations etc. are too late and withdrawals got stopped or delayed so much that the community loses even more faith..Chapter 6: People leave MtGox in masses and other exchanges profit.This is how market leaders fall... while with just a little business and marketing sense this could have been avoided... Just my 1ct .... we still see this phenomenon:1) During a rally, people who still have USD/other fiat funds at MtGox buy BTC2) Many of them transfer them to other exchanges, mainly Bitstamp3) As a consequence, the order book bid/ask ratios are inverse at MtGox versus Bitstamp4) Ultimately, MtGox market share drops further. Today, we again see Bitstamp with the same USD market share as MtGox:mtgoxUSD         103.7500   11,865.21bitstampUSD   96.8500   10,781.35 Very well said!This scenario is quite likely. thanks for your feedback and we will address it!Have a great BitDay :-) thanksBut seriously, we will likely be having some free offers in the future, but I do not have the details yet In the meanwhile, we see a lot of demand to our special -20% off trial offer which is an attractive way to get the best forecast in the bitcoin sphere P.s. newsletter has been sent out to subscribers and bitcoin prices are following it :-) thanks for the question. we will let you know if and whenfor subscribers: we just issued a new short term special updatefor "to-be-subscribers": we still have a -20% discount trial offer for your first month here: www.digitalcurrencyresearch.com
This is crazy....Call the police maybe...(Borrowed from the song "call me maybe"; it would be funny if it wasn't about serious money) one thing that many people are not aware of or do not want to accept is that technical analysis =chart patterns = price is a leading indicator This means that the news will follow prices, apart from very short term news spikes.We anticipated well the rally we are seeing now because an important trend line has been broken to the upside . bitcoin short term update issued to subscribers !WATCH THIS... correct. and most of our special indicators support this the exciting news is that bitcoin is rallying, in line with our forecast :-) the final bottom will likely be in the single digits. this may take 1-2 years Thank you so much for taking the times to address all my questions. And indeed, you have tested it seriously.Perhaps I was a bit misleading.My point was more that there can be better entries and exits than the 10/21 automated method.It is still a great method with the 10/21 mov. averages but there can be better ones.The 10/21 method is up 2x versus buy and hold.Our forecasting method from the newsletter is up much more... sorry if I sound negative, but when looking at the past months of trading, I do not think that the 10/21 moving average is a good trading indicator. most of the time it gave false signals or it too late to generate outstanding profits. have you backtested it seriously over the past 6, 12, 18 months?  wenn jemals überhaupt... This works all very well, but there is one problem:Recently I see some gaps in the chart. Is this appearing if I am not online 24/7? Is there any way to avoid those gaps without the need to be online and connected to the feed all the time?thanks for your help Instead, on bitstamp, it works very smoothly.Trading and withdrawals work fine and fast and customer service is immaculate. sorry, it was a typo on my end. now it should work. please let me know.thank you for your understandinghttp://www.digitalcurrencyresearch.com/ New forecast newsletter issued containingBTCLTCStocksPrecious MetalsNew subscribers can get a 20% discount for a trial month:www.digitalcurrencyresearch.comTrading is expected to become more volatile in the next weeks.. thanks.And we still have a 20% discounted trial offer for our most followed forecast I agree with you overall that MtGox is not dead.All I am saying is that their market share has been plummeting and is likely to continue to fall until they provide more reassurance and better transparency.In the meanwhile, other exchanges will continue to grow. As they grow, they will also have more profits to reinvest into better trading engines etc which again fuel their growth  Alright  It is quite normal the the MtGox market share does not go to 0 in one go.But losing market share from 80% about 6-9 months ago down to about 40% is massive.Think about if Coke or google lost half of its market share... I have stopped using MtGox, too.Stopgoxxed :-)Goxstopped :-) what is the reason you are so biased and protective about MtGox?  bitstamp has 4.3 k BTC volume and mtgox 8.3k.if you say bitstamp has poor volume, then mtgox also has poor volume
and bitstamp has already almost 50% of (low) weekend volumeMarket            Last       Volume (24h)   Bid   Ask   High   LowmtgoxUSD           90.0000   9,592.67   90.48   90.50   93.10   89.00bitstampUSD   86.0400   4,073.64   85.89   85.95   87.07   84.27 what is ffs? Thanks for your comments: To clarify:1) We keep using MtGox for the technical analysis as long as they remain number 12) We monitor the next largest exchange in parallel to be prepared for a change and also to increase the depth of our research. Currently, the number 2 exchange in trading volume is bitstamp. If others get better and overtake bitstamp, fine. We do not have relationships with any exchange and hence we can make unbiased decisions.And.. I agree that Gox has improve the trading engine, but as long as they dont improve the versatility (stop orders, O.C.O. orders, etc) and customer service & transparency, there is a risk that they will be overtaken by other exchanges. mtgox itself is pretty much dead. at least declining like hell.kraken can link to bitstamp like bitfinex does trading itself works reasonably well, but even the trading process is outdated.on almost all brokers worldwide you have stop loss, stop buy, OCO, etc. trading options and on gox there is still only buy and sell possible.I think it is (1) lack of innovation and (2) terrible customer service and management that let them down It has been reliable thus far, I had never a serious issue and they had lowest fees. But now, things change and this is why I move away. this is really true... Unfortunately for bitcoin.But looking forward , other exchanges will take over the lead. but they will need to show much better customer service and transparency I must say that I find it unfair practice to bump that thread so frequently. If intended or not, it provides an advantage to others, including me. I have refrained from doing that regularly, but we only have two choices:Get a moderator to intervene with cypher docs practice or if not, we will likely see all analysts bumping their threads more and more.I don't want that and I also don't think we should ask people to delete all their posts just to avoid this issue. This is just my honest pov. here are a couple of thoughts based on what I am observing. And thanks so much for all the great insights. Keep it coming since this clarity provides transparency to the bitcoin community.1. Gox must have a big liquidity problem: they only process small withdrawals. While they don't process larger ones. I know from my own experience and from friends that since more than 5 weeks no withdrawal larger than 3000-5000 USD went through. Let me know if you got a larger withdrawal processed.2. Based on the above, I believe that the leadership days of MtGox are counted. As I looked today , bitstamp is on track to overtake MtGox as market leader soon. They already are 50% of MtGox today. Providing transparency on my side, I have just cancelled all my USD withdrawals , converted into BTC and transferred to bitstamp, bitfinex or cold wallet. By the way, so far I found bitfinex trustworthy as I had smooth experiences both for trading and USD withdrawals. It seems that others have done the same recently and that may be the reason why the bitstamp /  MtGox spread is narrowing. MtGox is drained.... 3. As a consequence, Digital Currency Research will now look into starting to display bitstamp charts. That said, we can reassure subscribers that we are already monitoring bitstamp and the forecast is the same.It would help if bitstamp prices would be available soon as live charts on Sierra chart and trading view . Perhaps someone could help on this front. Agree with you.It would be great if MtGox could resume withdrawals Es ist viel einfacher:Technische Analyse funktioniert. Daher ist ein ganzer Wirtschaftszweig entstanden. Wer nicht dran glaubt braucht technische Analyse nicht zu nutzen. Thanks, and indeed, the report will be issued today as planned. New short term update just issued to subscribers including education.And, we still take new subscribers for the special promotional -20% trial offer. Click here: http://bit.ly/1aeEs6Y for info:Bitcoin and other forecasts can now also be paid with litecoin and USD thanks everyone We mentioned that the next scheduled full report will be on July 14.In the meanwhile, we continue to issue interim updates.We hope you could profit from the last trading idea which led to a +25$ gain per bitcoin +10000 We should get some clarity on MtGox:Are any fiat withdrawals possible or not? A while ago they suspended USD withdrawals, but mentioned that EUR and other currencies would not be affected.However, EUR withdrawals seem not to work over the past week.Who in the forum has the same problem or managed to withdraw fiat currencies?If anyone from MtGox staff reads this, please be so kind and provide clarity and respond.thank you this is indeed very worrysome about MtGox.I have the same issue. EUR withrawals dont get processed since 7 days at all.Didn't they say that EUR withdrawals are unaffected? litecoin continues to outperform bitcoin New digital currencies and financial markets report just issued to subscribers.we have some slots left for new subscribers before the summer period, so feel free to subscribe: http://bit.ly/11Lzaxy
the litcoin price rally goes on in the litecoin chart ... This is true Long term speaking , both, bitcoin and litecoin are in uptrends Actually don't own many litecoins.I just see that the technical litecoin chart picture looks good and want to let people know. it makes a lot of sense to monitor the LTC/BTC ratio, similar to the Silver/Gold ratio this is for sure also a valid oneor:China collapsing, Europe DOWN, soccer UP fair point. overtaking will be difficult, but getting closer is possibleby the way, there has just been a new guardian article published about alt digital currencieshttp://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jun/25/bitcoin-successors-litecoin-freicoin writing in blue font :-) perhaps the thread should be renamed:Gold collapsing, Bitcoin DOWN, Litecoin UP fundamentally this might not make so much sense, but markets are irrational, and this is why Litecoins could eventually rise to crazy levels - based on the technical chart picture Bitcoin DOWN and Litecoin UP.This could be a theme for the next months...What do you think? Discuss. The spike at mtgox is really artificial as people flee this exchange with their bitcoins stuffed into their wallets...Just look at the bitstamp order book where you see the opposite ...Everyone is trying to sell thanks. got it can someone explain why they should be a money transmitter? The bitcoin poll is reset. it will be interesting how the bitcoin sentiment looks like now This might have been a trigger. Yes.But independently, the technical analysis showed already over the past weeks and days that the next move will be up big time.I wonder if this could be like bitcoin in Feb - May 2013...Litecoin 100 $ is not impossible having MtGoc accepting LTC may be good, but it is not THE one thing that affects LTC prices. Litecoin prices have and can further explode without MtGox Litecoin prices and Litecoin charts alert:http://bit.ly/qJDsYw Litecoin prices and Litecoin charts alert:http://bit.ly/qJDsYw Litecoin prices and Litecoin charts alert:http://bit.ly/qJDsYw A central bank or a fed leader can't impact the market indefinitelyThey will be caught off guard by the market forces 
i agree the mtgox story sounds very fishy  We definitely agree that there is market distorsion and even if prices at MtGox rise a bit further, this is not bullish at all.Certainly, this is a great arbitrage opportunity to buy at bitstamp and sell at MtGox. I.e. if you could buy BTC for 1 million USD at bitstamp and sell at MtGox, you would make approx 100,000 profit now. no worries. this discussion is very good. no reason to stop Technical analysis of bitcoin charts and bitcoin prices has worked very well over its entire trading history since 2010, even in the beginning when market cap was tiny I still remember the first TA with a triangle at 0.065$ where we predicted the huge breakout this is not good if it was not announced.any scheduled maintenance period should be announced well on time.just imagine the NYSE is suddenly not working and then people surprisingly find out that it is on maintenance... stocks would crash worldwide immediately same for me. that is worrying for BTC and BTC prices new short term alert issued 8h ago. and again, worked fine >btcxsounds interestingby when do you think you will start? hope you received it.forecast on track Thank you very much for becoming a memberYou will receive it tonight you are soooo right. new short term update issued to subscribers"knife..."  indeed, I use solely "graphical" = technical analysisand of course, within that, I developed a gut feeling of the bitcoin charts and bitcoin market overall over the past almost 3 years excerpt from last update to subscribers:"The red trendline is invalidated and there is more downside in the near term. Most probably, we will see at least  re-test of 95  105 $." andif we are in a "Sideways / flat correction (turquoise channel and blue line)... In this case, we would likely see a decline into 32  50 $ before prices reverse higher. most market movements actually happen without news, and all news info is embedded in the prices. this is why technical analysis works so well. we alerted subscribers about the break of the critical trendline around 127-128 $ and the drop then came as expected here the links:http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forecast-subscriptions.htmlhttps://digitalcurrencyresearch.com/sign_up/bitcoin-bull-bear/?currency=BTC last night's forecast is fully on track.new subscribers are now again welcome digitalcurrency research has been founded to enable better back end for bitcoinbullbear .No change to the quality of the analysis and forecasts but better and faster customer service and also better payment process this drop was severe and is berish until 130-135 is cleared to the upside again
You're welcome I was in The plane but modern Technology enabled me to send it before take off :-) This is all fine.In fact, it is an improvement as all has been automated for faster email delivery and overall customer service. great question. send me a PM please and I will get back to you. I have a strong point of view on the current trading volume, why this is the case, and what it means going forward special update to subscribers just issued24 hours left to get in or remain in the June 2013 subscriber club tut gut mal wieder ausnahmsweise in deutsch zu schreiben nicht nur bitcoin, ich auch :-) this is true. bitcoin prices can rally for an extended period of time despite elevated bullish sentimentand this also applies to the stock market as many already know, litcoins are now traded on bitfinex which could also help making it grow most of this is going to happen we have one bear in the poll now... Special update just issued to subscribers.We still have spots left for the June 2013 subscription cycle.See here: http://bit.ly/U77heH nice one Thanks for the reply. I have contacted quentin on Dec 29, 2012 and have not received a reply.It is true that I complained about the process but still have the right to my shares.  It would be great if we can bury that fight we had. The key issue is as i am in a French speaking area and have just found last week a lawyer who can help me on the paperwork. this is the truth. I will comply to your process now, even if it is costing me days and money. But again, lets bury this fight. it has been fun to watch all the skeptical people about bitcoin lately.anyway, our forecast is fully on track and subscribers know itlet the BITBEARS say what they want.. you cannot just close this process. I will also claim my shares, but need another 2 weeks, due to your requirements and local issues in my countrythank you  no, no cryptocrash in sight. it might be the opposite.stocks down, bitcoin UP you are right. I checked again and yes, the stop was exceeded by 4 points before reversing down. the poll is reset. feel free to vote again you are so right. the crash will be devastating to the world
a little bit human, yes :-)how many bottles of champagne do I get if my stocks (S&P500) top call for Today, Tuesday May 21, 2013 was correct :-) again just being human as I like champagne :-) i just got struck by a sense of humor. at least I thought it is funny.my point was that i did a chart analysis on the stock market and based on that, most probably we see an important top this week.and then i connected this to the song "i got a feeling.."and the essence was that it is NOT about feelings, but about that technical chart analysis.... I can understand that this did not make sense without explanation. I got a feeling .. eh analysis. tomorrow stocks will top for at least some few weeks of pullback yes, this is right. not a single conference in my 3 years with bitcoin had any meaningful price effect. better focus on technical analysis... thanks for the feedback. the report will come tonight, ready for the market opening on Monday. Next week will be in important one for stocks there is quite some shorting possible on www.bitfinex.com sure it will come as explained on the weekend to reflect today's close in the analysis The Epic Bitcoin Charts Bubble http://bit.ly/qJDsYw new bitcoin charts forecast and bitcoin technical analysis issued to subscribers:Title: Focus yes, bitcoin volatility is often equal to penny stocks, but this is not a bad thing per se :-) a separate question, please:how can one avoid data gaps when not online? I am using the new bridge. Also, how can one use the historical data and then continue with the bridge data. when I tried, it does not add the new data at all.thanks you Tonight we will be issuing a very important newsletter for the bitcoin future to subscribers.For those who like to join before and receive it as well, please let us know fast:http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forecast-subscriptions.html. this is quite possible looks like a triangle is developing , again with the most likely outcome of a heavy LITECOIN rally :-) no worries, 95% of my funds are not in shorts, but will employ them in the next days into S&P500 shorts. we will see at least a 100 point drop soon yes. just go to http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forecast-subscriptions.html thanks for the order book chart.we just issued a short term special outlook to subscribers: title: upward reversal!? new short term outlook issued to subscribers 30min agofeel free to join for May. we still have slots open Dear All,this is our first litecoin technical analysis.LTCUSD seems to have completed a 5 wave rally to the 5.9 $ high two weeks ago. The decline back to almost 1$ seems to be only a corrective a-b-c wave. Also, the rise from that low looks impulsive and a rally above 4.5 $ will likely confirm that.Short term, most likely is a rally to about 5 $.Your S3052 since a few days, it really looks all screwed:http://postimg.org/image/qjkddba5t/full/1) the intraday data is displayed backwards (right to left from morning to evening and not how it should be from left to right)2) it shows several times the same candles (i.e. 3x per day)how can this be fixed?
weekly newsletter issued to subscribers another homerun forecast: +50% since sundaynew short term update issued to subscribersand 5 days left for the May subscription period 7 days left for new subscribers to enter for the May period and also for existing subscribers to continuethanks you so much for the support and trust! I appreciate it. new bitcoin charts and bitcoin price forecast issued to susbcribers bitrider,thank you for the great feedback, and yes, financial markets including bitcoin can move fast sometimes in the direction against your position +250% rally in bitcoins after the 50 $ low. who would have thought that?the bitcoin novices predicted a decline to below 10...all this bubble talk... new prices as of April 17, 2013 we see a bounce up as we speak. prices rallying from key support (subscribers know what I am talking about) this is at least a theoretical possibility the poll  in this thread is reset, waiting for your opinions on the next days and weeks for bitcoins. it is quite turbulent and exciting at the same time.please do not hesitate to share your rationales as well on why you think it goes up or down not necessarily, given the recent price action, I would not recommend the quarterly option that much for people who want to actively trade bitcoinsfor very long term investors, the quarterly update may still be very good (avoids hectic moves..)  updated prices so far today's top was 162.9 $ on track new short term update to subscribers issued a while ago and the result is on track  can you explain? here are the updated prices, valid until superseded weekly newsletter issued to subscribers short term trading idea update just issued to subscribers Sell signal came at 9:37 PM Amsterdam time on March 28, 2013. At that time, BTCUSD traded at 86.5 $. After that, bitcoin prices fell to 75 $.I will issue an alert in the next 24 hours to subscribers on the questions:1) is the decline over and we see new highs?2) will we see a further decline
can you or someone else explain what "bitcoin days destroyed" really means? for a non tech , non geek, please :-)thanks and the 100 $ might not be such a big barrier... agree with you and I also think it is not extremely likely to bank runs in italy and spain. however, the herding behavior is very psychologic and a butterfly wing-stroke can sometimes cause a huge storm.in cyprus itself, it will most likely be chaotic today despite the capital controls and if the cypriots withdrawl 300 eur every day over the next weeks, the banking system still implodes there tomorrow there will be a shit storm in Cyprus with the bankrun. will be interesting to watch...   bitfinex.com is actually quite simple to use (I am not sure how secure the site is, but it works for short selling and long buying with margin) :-)we will seetomorrow will be interesting as the Cypriots will run at the banks... and how know if this spreads yes, I also see that and this is why I am charting always the BTC/Gold ratio and this is rallying like hell since the inception of BTCperhaps this thread would be better called:"Bitcoin outperforming Gold"   not sure I understand your question. can you restate it, please? sorry your bitcoin call was very good, Cypher. and many folks in the bitcoin community made great bullish calls.at the same time, we have to state that gold has not collapsed at all so far I bank run starting in Cyprus when those banks reopen and a spreading to other markets such as Italy, Spain could be in the cards those walls come and go... in any case, the Bitbears may really have a hard time to stop the rampant BITBULLS who want to see triple digits. And even 100 $ may not hold them up. while there can and will always be sudden sharp corrections, the trend is UP on all time frames and bears may get hurt if they try to stand in the way of the BITBULLHORNS only about 2 $MM USD needed to reach 100 $ per bitcoin... +1 even your red trendline was constructed wrongly. it was already broken when you drew it. +100000  +1this is why when analyzing charts of financial markets, you always look at the big, long term picture first Thank you for bringing this up again.1. I agree with you that Gigavps should DEFINITELY GET THE SCAMMER TAG2. I also agree that based on the FINCEN info it is clear that we should request our shares back and otherwise sue him.Gigavps you better fasten your seat belt. implying that the same thing happens again in a  row is the most fundamental mistake.instead, most often the second time will be very different from the first time.it is not so easy to predict the market, and this is why it requires constant analyses all the time. it would be too easy otherwise to make money consistently (unfortunately, as this would be quite cool)
weekly bitcoin charts and bitcoin price forecast newsletter just issued to subscribers i hope it stays peaceful, but unfortunately money or the lack of it creates anger all the time which often leads to conflicts and war ultimately. correct. there is no way for the euro to survive over the next years It might now happen over the next few days, but there could be some traction behind the theft of savings from the cyprus peoplehttps://twitter.com/search?q=%23bitcoins4cyprus&src=hash Poor Cyprus people got stripped off -6 to -9.9% of their savings over the weekend.This could be the time that they adopt or at least save some of their wealth in bitcoins.If you like to tweet / retweet / follow and comment on this:https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bitcoins4cyprus&src=hash sorry if I sound like a teacher, but have you studied the financial markets a bit before thinking about shorting bitcoins?you even seem to imply you can make money without doing any single trade (if I understand your post well) Bitfinex should work as mentioned above. Newsletter just issued to subscribers.Forecast on track.Thank you again for the loyalty.And to new people who think about subscribing: we still keep the 0.99 BTC/month trial offer for max 3 months open until March 30 (we have 30 slots left). Try it out and join the big club:http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forecast-subscriptions.html thanks Klaus!!! New update just issued to subscribers.Also, we still run the limited-in-time and special trial subscription promotion for 0.99 BTC/month for  max. period of 3 months.Click here to subscribe: http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forecast-subscriptions.html funny to see those top calls from weeks ago.. typically, triangles appear at the end of a wave pattern (wave 4 of an 5 wave impulse upmove). in this case, I'd say that probabilities to break out higher are 60-80%  for bitcoin.That said, we do not see a triangle forming any more at this stage  Typically, it is better to look at currency volume vs. number of shares or bitcoins in this case (as long as tge currency is rather stable.. and at least for now, the USD is rather solid, despite all the doom sayers) thanks for the feedback. always trying my best.and by the way, the poll is reset, so feel free to VOTE.over the near future, I will publish again a sentiment study based on those results forecast has materialized again. thanks to my subscribers for the great trust.and for new subscribers, we still have some trial slots for March:www.bitcoinbullbear.com most probably yes, unless a hungry bull eats it quickly on its run.. there are some folks betting on a turn down below the all time high. most likely, they have only the interest to avoid prices going higherbut I am not sure if they will manage. the upward pressure is huge, and their ask orders could well be a great dinner for the bulls. and when the all time high breaks, fasten the seat belts... in downtrends, it is not wise to catch the falling knifein uptrends like we are in now, it is not wise to try and stop the launched rocket I was just checking whether you read it.Just joking. I am very sorry for that mistake. It it the only time it happned in 2 years, but still, I don't like it.Now all is fine with the current version. weekly newsletter for bitcoin, stock markets and precious metals issuedplenty of opportunities...
could also be it.. did you check on the betting sites? there are 3 possible reasons for putting up this wall1. to buy cheaper coins or cover shorts cheaper  behind the downward pressure from the wall2. to sell the coins at the wall price3. to play and have fun as a big bitcoin trader with all the little other traders and fool around>2. is rather unlikely as he could sell his coind better in small portions at a higher price<1. and 3. are both more probable +1 new bitcoin forecast issued to subscribers yes, true.but still, it is a nice appealing goal, if eventually bitcoin will have a higher "mkt cap" vs. gold. wow... now the long term goal is clear... 1. this is why I mentioned that the BTC/Gold ratio is at an all time high, which is independent from absolute unit effects2. what is the "mkt cap" of Silver and Gold? +1buying a breakout as we are seeing it now, might indeed be better than trying to anticipate the top.. changed it to blue. sorry for that mistake :-) where is the "BITCOINS SOLD OUT" sign? Today, BTC made a new all-time-high versus Gold at 0.0128 (above the June 2011 high of 0.0108).Could this be the start of more..? If I did not have the live experience from the rally in 2010 and 2011 i may have become bearish ovwr the padt weeks...but fortunately i started analysing bitcoin already in october 2010 and this is why i madenthe bullish calls in the padt weeks and months..it seems to be a one way road up. the trend is the bulls friend, until proven otherwise. SHORT TERM UPDATE ISSUED TO SUBSCRIBERSAnd: a couple of hours to go for the special 0.99 BTC per month subscription offer (max 3 months for first time subscribers). Until the end of day of Jan 31, 2013 you can still register with me.http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forecast-subscriptions.htmlThanks already for the many new subscriber registrations!!! just had a chat with Max Raskin, the author of this article and sent him his first BTC ever as donation :-) I will do the same!!!! I remember this song from long time ago whilst clubbing... this is 100% fair.And that's why I said that this is just one set of charts to look at.I always follow many different bullish and bearish chart options in parallel in the subscriber service and make bear or bull calls in an agile way. at least always trying my best 800,000 USD is about 30 seconds of APPL volume... great idea yes, how did you know. I just bought I time machine last week with a few bitcoins :-)thanks for spotting the typo.. Is the current state of bitcoin charts similar to 2011???.http://bit.ly/qJDsYwlooks very similar, and not totally improbable.this does not mean that this IS the future outlook, but there was similar skepticism and bears crawling out of their hole at around 3 $ and 6-7 $ in spring 2011 - and then prices quadrupled again in the next 4-5 weeks.
just showing a parallel of current 2013 picture to the run up to the all-time-high in 2011.http://bit.ly/qJDsYwlooks very similar, and totally possible.this does not mean that this IS the way it goes this time, but there was similar skepticism and bears crawling out of their hole at around 3 $ and 6-7 $ in spring 2011 - and then prices quadrupled again in the next 4-5 weeks. short term update issued to subscribersequal distance target I agree, in blue, as always :-) why west coast US timezone? bitcoin trading is global and at that time, there are more regions who can trade bitcoins   still 6 days to go for the special 0.99 BTC per month subscription offer (max 3 months for first time subscribers)http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forecast-subscriptions.html yep. chilling and riding the BITBULL at the same time  peaceand as you may see, I can also become bearish with bitcoin, but not now I also have nothing against someone analyzing the bitcoin charts in a different way.I just made my statement to (i)  protect my subscribers who pay for it and also (ii) my guts turned upside down with his wrong forecast that he was even defending for weeks. If people have followed him, they missed out one of the biggest rallies bitcoin has seen in its life.and to lucif:I am not a perma bull. You have just not been there when a bearish stance has been warranted. and as you seem to be comitted to remaina  subscriber even with assuming other identities, there is nothing I can do.sorry for becoming emotional but I am just a human being.. It is not really about the fact that you are using fib numbers and common indicators.It is because you get many special analyses per week and a 10+ page newsletter every week and then start a thread abiut the same thing: bitcoin technical analysis.even if you do not copy anything directly from my service, reading it will at least impact you and this is not honest practice.i know many financial advisers and newsletters who do not permit this, nor do I.Why don't you accept that I return your bitcoins and then you do not have any financial loss.And then you can carry on with your analyses in an unbiased fashion. Let just do the following. I remove you from my subscriber list and refund your bitcoins. Then there is no potential conflict any more. lucif,seriously, I do not understand what you are doing here.First, you subscribe to my service and you are still a subscriber for many more monthsThen you come up with your own technical analysisThen you decide to be bearish in contrast to the subscriber service, tricking some people into the completely wrong direction (you have been bearish since 13.5 $ and since then prices rallied about 30%.Then you copy some of the views I give exclusively to subscribers (like the 50% retracement chart, etc.) which you are not allowed toApart from the fact that this is not fair, you may influence others and make them lose money.I do not understand.Perhaps someone who is neutral can judge about this? you will get the last update and last newsletter within approx. 8-12 hours after you paid. most likely earlier but I need to sleep sometimes...I take BTC only  and this is exactly why there needs to be a revolt against this unfair behaviour from Giga 11 days left for the trial offer. thanks already for the many new subscribers and they won't get disappointed. Wrong.The probabilities of these events are always prices in the charts. weekly newsletter is out now. forecast materialized and still running.And still 13 days left for first time subscribers to get the trial offer for 0.99 BTC / Monthhttp://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forecast-subscriptions.html höhere volatilität, aber klar bullish im moment... new 20 month high, in line with forecast.weekly newsletter to be issued in the next few hours including new targets Bitcoins almost sold out globally.But I can understand people not putting their coins up for sale in a bull market we are in.
 short term update issued Me and my subscribers too. :-)My subscribers have probably profited a lot from my correct bullish forecast. For new subscribers, there is a reduced trial price for the subscription service: 0.99 BTC per month for maximum 3 months.This is valid until end of January 2013 and limited to 50 new subscribers. Be quick if you are interested. http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forecast-subscriptions.html could be a nice short squeeze coming when 14.5 $ falls there could be a big investor accumulating "secretely" coins around 13.86 - 14.2 $. whenever prices falles a bit he is buying up all the asks This is exactly the point.Markets are NOT rational and fact based but purely psychological and thus is why you get irrational exuberance bubbles and crashes.And because most people do not know about this or don't believe it, most people sell right at the bottom and buy at or close to the took And only those who are " rational about the irrationality of markets" are in the right side... and what also comes to my mind is that often the big rallies started in Russia, then continues in Western Europe. And then North American and Latin American bitcoin traders who still slept during that time, found themselves having to buy 1 or 2 $ higher...If 14 $ falls (there are only 3.5 k BTC left at 14 $...), it will get even more exciting and if it happens before America wakes up.. We will see. my view is that psychology produces those chart patterns I have to agree with you. Bitcoin is somehow our "baby" and it feels fantastic to see it alive and kicking and growing +1.Well said.  looks like an avalanche erupting soon ... "Both of these head and shoulders have a similar construction in that there are four main parts to the head-and-shoulder chart pattern: two shoulders, a head and a neckline. The patterns are confirmed when the neckline is broken, after the formation of the second shoulder.    The psychology of traders represented in the head and shoulders pattern is similar to that of the double top, in that bulls and bears struggle for supremacy at different price levels.  As with the double top volume and the price target play a large part in this struggle between the psychological mindset of buyers and sellers."link: https://sites.google.com/site/tradingstrategiesschool/module-2-chart-pattern-analysis/head-shoulders-and-reverse-head-shoulders and more in detail explanation in those bookshttp://www.elliottwave.com/books/ewp/default.aspx?code=ocomihttp://www.elliottwave.com/socionomics/default.aspx?code=ocomihttp://www.elliottwave.com/psishsb/default.aspx?code=ocomi you are right. the underlying factor behind technical analysis is psychology = herding behavior. but it works... looks rather like panic buying of the bears that got trapped 13.98 $.exciting... new 5 months high seconds ago at 13.95 $ and prices still moving higher. forecast on track the reason is clearly technically.bitcoin prices broke out of the sideways consolidation I highlighted to my subscribers already on Dec 23. And after the last short term breakout alert, prices indeed broke out following and analyzing bitcoin since 2.5 years already, I must agree to you.Bitcoin has many many times surprised to the upside and invalidated topping calls from many other analysts We continue to offer new subscribers trial offers at 1.99 BTC per month in January.Send an email to S3052 at gmx dot ch
"Soon" materialized as expected.A new short term update is issued:Title: NEXT!? +1Thats why we gave the big buy signal already at around 5 $ last year... short term forecast issued.Title: Soon... Thanks. It seems we are in the same "team" since my theory and forecast is exactly the same:Current monetary system to fail, leading to unemployment between 25 - 75 % (yes, this is a wide range and varies by region), social unrest, system breakdowns (electricity, internet), wars (I pray that it won't lead to the ultimate nuclear earth wipe-out).During this financial breakdown, PM and Bitcoin will likely do very well. For bitcoin, of course provided that the network stays intact.And Gold will likely first decline in value and could go down even into the 1000 - 600 zone before reversing and then rallying to unprecedented levels. can you specify what you mean in more detail? thankswhat are the risks and opportunities you see for both, BTC and PM's in the next 2-4 years? +1 the same applies to me.gigiamining, please send all the documents to me  stochastic,thank you very much for the clear update! +1 I agreeThis is an insane debacle for Gigamining. I have gotten confirmations from all other asset owners without any weird verification, and only Gigamining is creating such a mess. I speculate that they do not have the funds to pay back and hence make it so difficult to claim the shares. new year's short term update issued on Jan 1, 1:31 PM CET the chart is useful for both, up and down moves.For upmoves, it shows where some mid term resistance can be.For downmoves, the envelope bands show support zones which is around 12.37 - 13.And this chart is solely focused  on the mid term picture, not at all about short term forecasts.Only in the subscriber section I show many more charts and especially short term outlooks.  the upward line is a bit distorted and in reality connect the highs of 7.22 and 15.4. And this line helps defining a possible stopping point on the way up. It is currently running at 25$ the image is also here:http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/  Overall, I like your perspectives in this thread a lot. I am still not 100% sure if the weekend dip is really something consistent that is useful to trade it.Particularly the bank opening hours do not play a big role any more (I think). There is so much cash in the exchange. Look at the MtGox order book: The bids  down to 10 $ are almost 1,000,000 USD strong. So, it is just a matter of "buying appetite". People COULD, if they wanted, buy a lot of bitcoins with the cash they have on the exchange. But they don't do it. Perhaps weekend volume is low because people relax and do other things more than trading bitcoins? we are in a rare period where ask walls are very thin and prices do not move up rapidly. will be interesting to see what happens in the next 24-48 hours just got some info that it is STOCHASTIC who owns the asset! Since I still had a few shares of the USD asset, which I used to hedge BTC long positions : Who is the one created this asset and what happens to those shares?Nefario has not yet released the shareholder info. holiday newsletter issued.we wish you all a healthy, happy and ideally profitable year 2013. may bitcoin surpass 100 $ :-)
do we have a bet or not? I thought we agreed on option 1 I am fine with option 1 as I said. Still, it is a bit unfair that in the event of an USD failure the bet goes to you, but anyway, lets go ahead.I will add this bet on betsofbitcoin in the next 1-2 daysP.S. And to clarify: I never indicated that I did not forecast the USD fail. In fact, it is the opposite. I expect this very strongly since years. thanks muchnow it is working againhttp://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forecast-subscriptions.html forecast on track :-) no, I just wanted help to define the physical Silver price.I am fine with the bet, except the point on the USD currency change / default, because I think this is very likely.There are two options.1) reduce the bet to 10 BTC and I go with your conditions2) keep 100 BTC but remove the currency risk. If the USD changes in backing or does not exist as it does today (meaning all USD is now backed partially by gold or some other hard asset or another US currency is created or if the USD is modified by chopping off zeros on the bills (LOL)) NOONE WINS.  another new short term update has been issued to subscribers so, smoothie.why don't you propose your terms of the bet. I am confused with what you are saying.how much do you want to put in?what are the conditions? agree. itis fun to watch someone getting so agitated...I need to sleep and work sometime and that is why I cannot post one second after every smoothie question.. +1 nice and simple not trolling. I like challenging bets. Silver may go down to 3-4 $ and I don't find it impossible to suggest that physical silver will be worth 2.5 - 3.3 x more during that time.Anyway, I agree that it is borderline, but as I said, this is a challenging bet and I would not bet the farm on it.And in any case, I am short Silver since the 34 $ area (as per subscriber newsletter) and will not mind it the crash stops above 10 $ even for paper silver. this will still be a trade of the century perhaps we should run a contest for the best bitcoin related website and award the top 10. just an idea a new short term update has been issued to subscribers:Bitcoin trading idea! you are so right. but on the other hand, one person already bet 1 BTC against me in the bet, so its up and running..Others are invite to join :-) aren't the odds different the closer it gets to the event deadline? but you may be right. I am not so familiar with this site.Not even sure if I can change the bet deadline now any more? This is to continue the thread after the similar one got locked down.This is about speculation on Silver prices and discuss technical analysis and fundamentals.I have made my bet official. Silver will move below 10 USD at least intraday before Dec 31, 2016As I could not find a reliable link for physical Silver prices, I use paper prices. If someone can help me out with physical silver prices, I will add another bet as promised for physical Silver prices.http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1044 I am up for the bet, as long as we properly define the accurate way to obtain the physical silver price.needs to be a sizeable market and not one seller at ebayalso , if the USD gets changed or defaults the bet is invalid I have submitted a bet there. waiting for approval now short term update issued to subscribers sorry, but I love blue...I am happy to accept the bet. I bet 10 BTC that Silver will have moved below 10 $ at least once intraday before Dec 31, 2016  yes, this is entirely possible
lets stop arguing and bet - if you are so sure. I bet that physical silver prices will fall below 10 $ before 31st Dec 2016 actually I agree with you that Silver sentiment is overly bearish, but this can mean two things: (1) Silver is in a third way down and prices fall from here hard(2) Silver is in a larger thrid wave down but short term is oversold and will blunce up into 31.2 - 32 and then turn down hard again. 31.2 - 32 $ is an area which I will short hard this is exactly my point. price development lead fundamentals, not the opposite. warren buffet will probably dump his silver  soon, if he is as smart as he thinks. once 26 $ breaks down we will see  a nice crash of both, physical and paper silver adding my few cents here:I focus a lot on the big picture first to identify the overarching trend. once this is defined, then the shorter term forecasts fall into place relatively easily. I use dozens of different indicators, including some new ones and also look at many alternatives.but then I try to keep the outlook very simple for subscribers and don't bother them with too many alternatives.also, I established very specific trading ideas which enables me and subscribers to track the quality of the service and outlook. this keeps me honest.I dont want to praise my accuracy and leave it up to subscribers to judge this. but based on the growing number of subscribers, it can't be that bad this is a typical reaction of someone who is bullish and keeps the hope alive that magically the asset moves into the desired direction just because you can buy something with bitcoins does not mean it is the right time to do so. Silver prices are falling and it is most often better to NOT try to catch the falling knife. it may be best to pick up silver when it is under 10$ +1 how do you know that I am not telling this to subscribers. are you a subscriber? It is entirely possible that bitcoin goes down with all other assets at least for a certain period of time.but, right now there is no sign that this is happening nearterm.there is also the possibility that bitcoin gains so much traction that funds move INTO bitcoins big time (i.e. I know of some projects out there that can make this explode)more in the subscriber section as predicted in my newsletter, Silver is going down (my subscribers can confirm this)But this is not the end.. there is much more downside once a key support level will be broken. ^ +1 bullish on what? Is The NASDAQ Close To The End Of The World? http://bit.ly/Wv5Qqc If you have a sound business plan i will consider investing 1000 $ into your bitcoin taxi. Including a huge bitcoin branding on the car. by the way, over the past 5-7 days, the Euro gained 3-4 % vs. the USD. Did you consider this as potential reason? We offer new services at cheaper prices down to 0.99 BTC per month.More here: http://bit.ly/U77heH  +1 a bit off topic, but this is an interesting read on the fiscal cliff negotiations:http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/09/opinion/logan-fiscal-cliff/index.html?hpt=ibu_r1 no worries. my subscribers are always one step ahead. I gave a warning alert just a few minutes before the drop from 13.8 to 13$  :-) this is one alternative, indeed

If anyone of you want to get in for January 2013, there is still the promotional price for 1.99 BTC per month BITBULLS are in control:http://bit.ly/qJDsYw in the end, the starting date does not matter as market psychologies and overall trends do not change with choosing an specific starting timeBut for you, I moved the starting date by one day so you are happy :-)http://bit.ly/qJDsYw Can you explain what your concern is?I used the same source that bitcoincharts is using and all my data is as accurate as possible. a week is a week as long as it is consistently 7 days, there are regions in the world who dont have a week defined monday through sunday. thanks, every weekly bar is 7 days x 24h in my charts agree.apostilles / affidavits are hugely expensive in many countries here in Europe and in my case would be about 80 CHF = 85 USD.This was not part of the contract,Now, Gigamining either needs to pay this on top of the asset buybacks and dividends or do the buybacks / dividend payments based on ID only you can also check outhttp://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com for live charts and bid / asks congrats to this major achievement This is crazy. I got emails from other asset owners saying that they will pay the dividends without requesting any more information and you require to do an affidavit. What is the background for this? Are you trying to scam us? forecast on track.just issues a new short term update to subcribers just issued a short term update to subscribers 14 min ago Das Bitcoin Kiez projekt ist absolut genial! Weiter so. Gas geben :-)leider bin ich nicht in Berlin Thanks a lot. I will do exactly what you proposed. +1.Agree. I think the bicoin community should finally do a revolution against such practices. I am happy to throw in all my few gigamining assets to go to court against them I have said this in the gigamining thread.This should get a big scammer tag and noone should do any business with gigamining any more. This can't be true. Are you joking???I have waited to reply to calm down the emotions but many hours later I am stil UPSET.This should lead to a scammer tag, in the most prominent way.You can not suddenly increase requirements leading to holding funds and dividends and shares hostage for so many people

Close this Sunday 23:59 CET yes, single period indicators (i.e. one indicator value in a daily chart can change depending on the definition of the close. but I never only look at one indicator value, but trends in those indicators. and in that case, a 30, 50, 200 day trend of an indicator does not change much with one day's value up or down  trading day or not, the indicators are all still valid.whatever the time frame is, it averages out those effects. new newsletter just issued to subscribers, covering bitcoin, stock indices (US, Europe), and precious metals.

Human herding.And thanks for your very polite attitude. Overall, all those nuances about block halving, difficulty changes, mining issues, etc. are already all prices into the charts.

New special short term update issued to subscribers: FORECAST FULLY ON TRACK can you explain what this means ? as a non US citizen, I do not know what this is about lol The weekly newsletter has just been shared with subscribers, including the big picture and short term trading ideas on BITCOIN, SILVER, and STOCKSIf you are interested to subscribe, there is a special offer for first time subscribers.Just send an email to S3052@gmx.ch This is true. MtGox is the most liquid and also a more and more professional platform, including improving customer service. Many other exchanges are having a too liquidity.
Special short term bitcoin charts update issued to subscribers.For new subscribers, we have a special offer until August 25. Send an email to S3052@gmx.ch to find out more. yes, posted before the fall. price was in the 14s when I posted it, then prices broke 15 $ as anticipated.now we have seen a shakeout of the weak hands, typical in bull markets/color] this is more and more fun to watch, how the bears chase the bulls.next mark to fall is 15 $I start to wonder if we see 20 $ in the next hours / few days This is not unusual in a bull market. The poll is reset again. Vote now so that we can see what the latest sentiment picture is. that's a fair comment.We can tackle this one by one:1) the linear breakout is confirmed.2) we can watch what prices do when they reach 20 to determine if and when a breakout of the log channel would happen.In the meanwhile 20 might be reached soon if this accelerated rally continues. shorted AAPL at 636.93 $ today. Stop is 645 (small risk, big opportunity)Let's see if this call is as good as the SBUX short call a few days ago +1 this is correct. BTCUSD should not move below 7.22 in the near future. indeed... quite exciting You are right overall, but as we are likely in wave III up, the advance will accelerate more and more in a parabolic / exponential way. Nice comparison.The count for the bear case is rather unlikely since the time span for a wave 2 correction would be too long versus the wave 1 advance. It is not impossible but does not look likely. What a rally, it seems to accelerate even further again Great post, and this is in line with our forecast and it is also in line with my experience in 2011.Most of the biggest advances actually happened over the weekend or close to the weekend as bears were caught off guard.In June 2011, prices tripled in just 8 days and the second strongest advance within that was on a weekend (Jun 4+5). For people interested in stock market forecasts, I am also including then in my subscription service:Here some examples http://stocktwits.com/BitcoinAnalyst: The bitcoin and financial markets newsletter has just been sent to subscribers.i.e. more than +110 % since our breakout call on bitcoinsIf you are interested to subscribe, send an email to S3052@gmx.ch as many people are speculating about this, I did a comparison of current bitcoin charts in 2012 versus the 2011 ramp up to the all time high:http://bit.ly/qJDsYw while a 10% dip can always happen, the above quotes are typical of a bullrun. still, many people don't believe that it can go much higher and then run behind the curve The bitcoin and financial markets newsletter has just been sent to subscribers.EXCITING WEEKS IN THE BITWORLD AND FINANCIAL WORLD OVERALL.i.e. more than +100 % since our breakout call on bitcoinsIf you are interested to subscribe, send an email to S3052@gmx.ch the rally heat is on Chart analysis is not mentioned here above.But this has been one of the best ways to predict bitcoin price movement.Even if some people don't believ in it, I have to say that it is a great tool: it encompasses already all the fundamental questions and brings it down to a simple thing. And it avoids getting trapped in a forest and mud of thousands of info sources.
here we go. not a bad forecast :-) It's probably even better as a weekly / monthly trader. If you pick the multiweek / -month lows and highs (i.e. the one in April 2011 at 0.58$, then 31.89 $ in June 2011, then the low in Nov 2011 at 1.994 $, then you can be a happy camper I posted a chart showing real historical bitcoin volatility here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1493.2420 Below is a chart displaying historical volatility. It shows that typically, higher volatility goes hand in hand with higher bitcoin prices For interested new subscribers, we have a special offer for you here:http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/EDIT: Last day to subscribe: Tomorrow is July 28. Subscribe and profit!!! So....Will we see further payouts? And if yes, when? A short term update has just been sent to subscribers. For interested new subscribers, we have a special offer for you here:http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/ +1000   prices in the US, Switzerland, etc. need to deflate as well, and I am sure if Italy remains in the Eurozone you will get espressos for less than 30 cent soon. you hit the nail on the head.There is a huge risk for Starbucks to experience price deflation. Soon people will return to home-brewed coffee which only costs pennies, or, if they go out, they do not want to pay more than a dollar or so  Thanks for great feedback. I am always trying to make the best possible forecasts.On Starbucks, I also like the company, the CEO is outstanding, and the products are great. I just see that the worldwide trend is going down. Look at coffee prices, they have crashed and will crash more, which is a good indicator that coffee demand is going (will be going) down. SBUX (Starbucks) about to break down .. will get nasty What do you expect bitcoin prices to do over the next weeks?you are invited to voteThe poll above is reset for you. +1The market is already to big for him to control it. Sure. I can't complain. In principle you would need to ask the subscribing customers. Pirate is too small of a fish to control and direct the bitcoin market over the long run. He can try short term but longterm fail - as he has even already admitted. First, we have deflation for quite a while before inflation kicks in. As per our subscription forecast, silver will drop Mich deeper and longer than most people expect here. You can subscribe for just 1.99 btc before July 28.

For interested new subscribers, we have a special offer for you here:http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/ Thanks for updating me.I have to admit that I find it a bit unfair that this is closed already. I was travelling the past days and did not read this thread. I just found it today and now the funds are gone...
+1. Thanks for working on Gold and Silver shorting options. is the claim page still open?I am still missing about 5000 USD from bitcoinica and would like to join the paybacks   Sounds very interesting. Could you also offer the inverse future = shorting Gold and Silver futures? this would be fun to watch :-) +1 Thanks.And your question is a good one.In our p.o.v., bitcoin prices have entered a major rally phase and fundamental news like the one we had yestetrday are lready priced in.What we observe as well is that we get .any more twittter followers from the financial world (hedge funds, analysts, press, traders, bankers) . Those folks seem to increasingly start (thinking about) investing into bitcoins.If this gets more traction, we will see more and more surprises to the upside - and a rally like the one we saw last year cam repeat itself easily.A +30 $ rise can be achieved within weeks... And only the ones who get funds  into the exchanges quickly will be ahead of the game.Even 100 $ this year can be realistic. As per "plan" bitcoin prices sliced through 7.22 like butter. This was in May 2012 one major reason for the latest rise can be found in technical analysis The prospects that bitcoin prices would likely rise to new 2012 highs was clear to us when prices moved above 5.2 USD. This was the time when we issued a rally call in our subscriber section.The technical chart patttern over the long term shows a clear wave structure that will be shared on Sunday with new price projections. clearly, 7.22 is resistance and prices may pause there for a while, but as I explained in the subscriber section, this is not required for many reasons. the order book sometimes fools traders.The next bigger resistance is 10 $.What do others think? the rally is on...What does the community think the next resistance is ? +1I am in the same position. I big part of my funds are locked up as well.Please help genjix.

Just a quick update on forecast accuracy: Since our strategic BUY trading option was triggered, bitcoin prices are up +25%.People who like to get into the August subscriptions pool, can send an email to S3052@gmx.chA key benefit of our service (apart from the proven forecast accuracy) is that you do not necessarily need to read emails every day, we do the work for you. Sometimes we give many updates per week, but if there is too much noise, you can relax and don't need to look at unnecessary analyses. I received the same a couple of days ago, but did not react since I have already shared everything with them weeks ago.I believe this recent mail could be a SPAM / FISHING attempt. I guess everyone likes excitement   same for me, checking emails several times per day, without any news any more.. very disappointing
Just sent the weekly newsletter to subscribers. A HELL OF AN EXCITING TIME for people involved in bitcoins If they go back online, I would consider using them again, but only if I will get the funds back soon. I do not accpet this taking longer than 2 months On this point, I agree fully with genjix. And it is true that the claims process means a lot of work.I just don't understand why it takes so long to pay out verified and accurate claims. This is clearly unacceptable. After almost 2 months, 83% of people did not get back anything.This is just after 15 people voting so lets see the picture once more people voted.http://bit.ly/oqr6IRBut this is still INSANE There should be 3 polls on that site. Works for me.http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/bitcoin-trading.html I am in the same disappointed mindset. I just transferred some funds to bitcoinica after hearing that they got registered as a financial service, so I thought it would be good idea to diversify. Obviously I was wrong. And unfortunately I did not receive anything back depsite all the reassurances that the claim is accurate since weeks.I am opening up two polls here to try and help the community to reveal the status of the situation, also potentially to take legal steps in case there is no progress.Please vote: http://bit.ly/oqr6IR at least BTC withdrawal still works EDITED: No trade was registered for many many hours some time. MTGOX was down and is up again.What happened is now the question. The Bitcoin Price forecast is out since last night. Short term update sent to subscribers. me too. It is good if the market does what we expect... nice...And accelerating in the curves. runaway train.. nice... Short term update mailed to subscribers. Title: THE CLEAR PATHFor new people interested, we offer a trial month for 3 BTC.Mail to S3052@gmx.ch before June 16 for this offer. +1. I can only echo that genjix's more frequent communication is great in (re)building trust I agree to the need of an audit for MtGox.It is a risk for them not to do it. Even if it might take a while, a competitor exchange will come up that does not delay withdrawals and then they will see their market share go down. Look at Nokia and Ericsson. They were the leaders in the mobile business and are now nowhere any more as they have missed the train.This is also a call for BETTER and VERIFIED and TRUSTWORTHY BITCOIN EXCHANGES.  If you do it right, you can get a major share in this growing market. What about the original topic, the payout: when will it start? The weekly report has just been issued to subscribers.Title for the Bitcoin Forecast: The path of least resistance is ... Title for the new Stock Market Forecast: More to come ... TA also works in these cases, because if you define support and resistances properly, you can (i) anticipate certain moves to a high probability and (ii) quickly jump on the train if it left the station, well before others can do. We have proven to be able to time this well since late 2010.
going on summer hibernation :-) sounds very good. thanks for the update Forget about the effect of the December change from 50 BTC to 25 BTC as price predictor. This is already priced in as it is public knowledge. A short term update has just been issued to subscribers. Title: Riding the Elliott Waves I agree. I still believe that genjix is a good guy and wants to do this properly, but I am now at a point where I need to see results (= refunds starting). And if not, I will join the legal process as you mentioned above it could happen again.. It always starts slow and then accelerates.. Danke fürs update.Hoffentlich akzeptieren die bald wieder BTC As usual, last call for June 2012 subcriptions The key question is who dares to buy >12 k BTC and push the price above 5.2 $.This could trigger a big rally , unless some dark one pushes the price down again, which is getting less and less likely as he is swimming against the stream. +1Couldn't have said it better. [color=][/color]that's a great question.The answer is actually quite simple:Focusing on technical analysis has guided me and I am tempted to say many dozens of subscribers very well through all "bitstorms".Because the charts include all fundamental infos and wild speculations, hacks etc. at all times.With that in mind, a bitcoin chart can be analysed in the same way as the Dow Jones , silver , gold, currencies, etc. And all the principles and rules work in the same way. The manipulator for sure wants to avoid losses in his total portfolio.But that could mean accepting a small loss with the bid and ask walls and the occasional15k BTC  dumps and purchases - versus protecting his holdings somehwere else. Perhaps he is highly leveraged at bitcoinica... that is correct.   What is the news from BFL? From observing closely the order book. when will trading start? +1 the remaining funds excl. 18k btc should be there .I guess its not a matter of IF but HOW they refund as without the database the process is tedious There will in some point be a divergence between paper and physical gold, but initially both will fall, as people need to raise cash from gold bullion, coins, but especially jewellery, teeth gold, etc. just to survive.
Yes, it is also correct that  those stabilization efforts have been going on already before the bitcoinica disaster.And also yes, it will fail for sure. The market does what it wants, not what a few players want. In the first wave of the Euro crash towards 1.18-1.19 and possibly towards parity, PM will dive with the Euro at least to Gold 1,300 Is this now the official procedure? If yes, please make it official properly. If not, sort it out and make the criteria official in the next 24 hours. Lock it , decide it, move on and dont continue with this hell of a confusion. BASTA You are right, I also look at BTCEUR which also shows some strength The reward drop is already priced in as it is already public knowledge. The new bitcoin weekly report is out to subscribers. "the calm before the storm"End of month is nearing. If anyone is interested in a subscription, just PM me. I think it is just fair that there is a reasonable deadline. People who are significantly affected by the disaster have very likely claimed already and this needs to be taken care of.There can always be another 2nd batch of claims processed afterwards, but you can't wait years to ensure that everyone is covered. Continuing the good discussion here, and not on the bitcoinica thread:Yes, this is right. But I can narrow the time scale: We will likely see more volatility in the next 10 trading days that will show >= 10% move(s)[/color] To the first question: I like blue a lot.To the second question: We are at historical low volatility which always leads to an explosion (and I also said this can take long, but its not a question of IF only WHEN). I do not say that to get more subscribers, I have a lot of them already. The reason why I am writing it is that I want to make people aware of the risk / opportunity even if they do not pay, because I feel there are a lot of people into bitcoins who are not experienced in trading and who may make big mistakes just because of some wild posts. you are right that there is good internal bitcoin market strength.But stability will soon be gone... Sorry, but this is not how it should work.You need to give a deadline for claims resolution and you handle all available claims and finalize them.You can always add remaining claims at a later stage. But you can not wait until the last claim comes in which could be anytime between now and 500 years.I expect a deadline for claims settlement which is about maximal 5 days out from today. thanks for shedding light on this on the separate thread.Even if this is not caused by bitcoinica this needs to be fixed to avoid more damage to the bitcoin economy and public perception.More professionalism is needed for ALL exchanges, not only bitcoinica, but also MtGOX thanks for shedding lights on this Have you noticed that prices have spiked a couple of times above 5.20$ but without the needed volume to actually allow for that ?it seems that there is something strange going on on mtgox . I wonder if there is some price fixing / fooling going on on purpose. This could be even related to bitcoinica.Does anyone know if bitcoinica is currently still trading on mtgox and is this outside of the normal order book.I was not aware that there are still dark orders posible. +1This is exactly what is needed.And if those answers will not be given by a reasonable deadline which to me would be 24 hours, people affected could consider filing a class action lawsuit.And if the ownership / responsibility is not revealed to do that, could get a court order to reveal this quickly. Smile....This is spot on: bitcoin logos are often indeed orange. I will do that soon. Biitcoins are traded broadly enough that the principles of technical analysis apply as well as for stocks, induced, currencies, precious metals and other commodities. No worries, I pay you all you can drink in beer for one day if I am wrong (if you drink beer) Volatility is something that is only one of many possible indicators. I only use it with care and again, only in conjunction with many other tools.If volatility is EXTREMELY LOW (like currently), it just says that very likely there will be some explosive price action afterward. But low volatility can persist for quite a while. Nevertheless, it almost never fails to anticipate very sharp movements. But patience is warranted until then.As one example, look at AAPLFrom Oct 2008 to Apr 2009 is trading at historically low volatility (as expressed through the bollinger bands which narrowed to a tight range in Apr 2009). And then look what happened afterwards. Now look at the past months in bitcoins..
Gold 1,300 $, Silver 13 $. It is that simple. I rather think it will soon be 100 (Gold) : 1 (Silver)Lets see , the jury is out the block halving will have near zero impact on bitcoin prices, because this is already anticipated and priced in (it`s public knowledge) I tend to agree with your ranges, with the addition that Silver most often behaves like an industrial metal and crashes with the entire financial market (i.e. Silver is already down about 50% from the Apr '11 high while Gold is UP vs. 2011..This is why I recommend 0-15% silver in bear markets like we are in. On igmarkets you can already short facebook as of Friday.. and I did it :-) New short term update for #bitcoin charts issued to subscribers: TITLE: More reasons why..  correct.  no weekend dip this weekend Stabilization is only temporary, as with all financial assets, and so it will be for bitcoin. In the next weeks and couple of months, we will again see 10%, 20% swings per day. +1There is a lot of upside in the bitcoin economy and it would not be surprising to see BTCUSD triple, quadruple, quintuple or more in the foreseeable future. +1. I agree with you: Just one investor could easily break resistance at 5.15 - 5.20 $ with 100 k$ and then the market moves...Just look at what happened in Dec 2010 / Jan 2011. I watched this live. There seemed to be big resistance but a big investor (I knew the guy) bought all coins just a little below 0.3 $ and then pushed it above that level. Back to the question of WHEN WILL WE SEE THE FIRST FUNDS BACK TO THE CUSTOMERS? This timing may well lead to more volatility of bitcoin trading and to know this date would be very much appreciated. There are many ways to look at volatility. Two of them are:* Bollinger bands (this one and the one below are available on bitcoincharts). You also see in this case that the bands are a bit wider than at the very narrow range on May 10* Chaikin's Volatility: "Chaikin's Volatility indicator measures the volatility of a security. High values indicate that prices are changing a large amount during the day. Low values indicate that prices are staying relatively constant. Note that both trending and level prices can have high or low volatility." http://www.tradingsolutions.com/functions/ChaikinsVolatility.html  Here is one little analysis trying to address your question.http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forum.html#/20111119/bitcoin-technical-analysis-1030059/page4/  This is no joke, but the upcoming reality. I am happy to provide more perspective if you want.  +1. Great summary.  Time cycles come and go, and if they are correct too often, this is typically the time when it does not work any more. Very short term, we may not even need a very bad week ahead, but if not next week, this does not matter. The next months will bring all financial markets down hard, no matter if PM, stocks, EURUSD, whatever. The only thing that may rise is BTCUSD. (by the way, our stock market forecast we issue regularly in the Bitcoin Weekly report is fully on track.  short term analysis issued: Volatility. +1. Agree with you. Bitcoin is not know enough to get any significant halo from these economic events.
BitcoinBullBear subscribers receive the full range of analysis: bitcoin, stock markets and precious metals.http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/ I agree. I have been in this forum since September 2010 regularly, and this is the worst handling of an issue. Even more worrying is that amir taaki who I respect and who is with intersango is quiet like a mouse.This is not a sign of "customer is king attitude" I would have expected While this is a good intent, I doubt that this will provide real useful information. For instance, many of my subscribers do not at all or not regularly visit the forum and won't bother to vote here. One day left to register for the special 2 weeks trial subscription for new subscribers for 1.90 Bitcoins.Send an e-mail to S3052@gmx.ch to register by May 15th, 2012.We already have many new people using this offer. THANK YOUP.S. Here the latest feedback: + "I've enjoyed the quality of your report very much. Thanks so much for your professionalism and overdelivery - whenever a notable event occurred, you were there with an update."+ "thank you for your services. You are doing a wonderful job" New short term alert out to subscribers:TITLE: The ALL-IN-CHART Hi Buddy,you are right that the bitcoin market got a bit boring lately, but I still think it is better to protect people from wrong trades and be boring than to lure them into bad and loss-making trades.The boring times will end quite soon... This is quite normal... the moment most people give up, the moment the train starts leaving the station.  what is kronos.io  The short selling option at bitcoinica is actually helping avoiding bigger sell offs, as short sellers MUST eventually buy back to avoid getting wiped out.Now, with bitcoinica down, no one has to buy (=cover shorts) any more, and selling pressure could mount.  Its quite simple and nothing bad here: The article is based on May 2 analysis with an update from May 9. Then I did the May 10 analysis and the short term chart picture changed bearish. To clarify. It is exactly the opposite of what you are talking about.The article mentioned is actually based on the May 2 weekly bitcoin newsletter.Yesterday evening, May 10th, we issued a new analysis and turned bearish. Right after that it is when prices fell.The most recent analyses are only for paying subscribers.  Apparently, they made 50 k USD per month as profit. They should easily be able to reimburse with a couple of months of their profit.And I agree, if they don't reimburse, it is their end. As much as I value the contribution of bitcoinica to the bitcoin economy, this is a big security issue for the entire bitcoin economy, because of the psychological damage it is causing.At least there needs to be (i) a reimbursement and (ii) heightened security measures implemented in the near future. The Bitcoin Weekly Report newsletter with bitcoin price forecast is out to subscribers This month, we offer a special 2 weeks trial subscription for new subscribers for 1.90 Bitcoins.Send an e-mail to S3052@gmx.ch to register by May 15th, 2012.  is this real or a faked report? just to be sure This is spot on. Whenever I start using even only 1% of fundamentals, I get into the danger zone. This is why I have only charts on my screen, without even having a chance to read or hear the news when I am making any trading decisions. short term update mailed Based on experience, one can trade exclusively using TA. I ignore completely any news since many years, and the more I focus on TA, the better my trading got. Typically, you'd use log charts for longer term time frames (particularly when it involves exponential moves) and linear charts for the shorter term.
Thank you. You are right, I will update it soon short term update mailed to subscribers This is great progress. The Bitcoin Weekly Report newsletter with bitcoin price forecast is out I agree with you that Robert Prechter has underestimated the insane money printing from the Fed and the effect that this had. At the same time, his real trading recommendations have mad big money. He does not give actual trading recos very often as a friend of mine who is subcriber told me. Prechter gives only about one recos per asset class every year or even couple of years. And these trade have either been stopped out quickly with minimal losses, or they pocketed huge gains. I.e. over the past 5 years, 2-3 S&P500 short recos were only losing 10-50 points each, and then one winner gained 600-700 points. cypher has done this with a mid and long term view in mind. wait another couple of months and we will see +1. Prices move in waves. there is always calmness in between, but then the next big wave is coming. Who knows, perhaps we will never see 5 $ from below again, or 4.73 $. the moment people start talking about infinite stability and or speculators getting bored, the sentiment is ripe for a huge volatility increase. the past hours have already given a glimpse of what is coming short term update mailed Agree with you that short term is bearish unless the last high is taken out. We will need to closely watch the pattern develop to see whether we remain mid and long term bullish or change direction. Everyone has the right to believe what he thinks is right. I believe the socionomics theory more, whcih says that the market itself is the best leading indicator for the economy and social mood.http://socionomics.com/ nice challenge. I like these.You are probably referring to the option b of the chart picture that implies another decline below 1.994 $. if this happened, this would likely have bad consequences on the exchange rate like a fall even below 0.1 $ and also for bitcoin as a whole. So far, the chart option a still looks more probable. the key trigger point is 1.994 $. what is your definition for the foreseeable end? and also the sentiment is too bullish for an immediate rally TH reason for the flat prices are not more speculators (we rather have fewer of them). The simple reason is the chart picture of bitcoin/USD. After a huge 3.5-fold rally from Nov 11, prices need to consolidate this rally. This will change after this consolidation is over. it's very simple. there are always cycles of high and low volatility. now we are in low volatility. soon we will see a massive move Bollinger band range on Friday were getting so narrow that one could expect a break and as a consequence, higher volatility. thanks. does does not sound like it is a liquid platform What does this starfish really mean? No shorts possible? Does this mean that bitcoinica has no bitcoins in reserve? long term, bitcoin remains bullish as long as prices stay above the November 2011 low of 1.994 $.
Those people who followed me since 2010 know that our forecasts are bullish and also bearish, if the charts tell it that way. Now, we are not short term bullish any more. this weekend will likely be a very active one... Slush, did you check it already? The new bitcoin charts & bitcoin price forecast is out and it again includes a special. How to subscribe: http://bit.ly/oGVMrh  Satisfied to not have played APPL earnings. I shorted 638, 621 and covered at 563 yesterday. Now probably re-shorting soon. 600 is not a bad level. This will be exciting. I think we see a strong move either way, and with a potential to get this strong move reversed within a couple of days right after. Big volatility.This is a 50/50 bet after AAPL already moved down a lot and it a bit oversold. But, ... the strongest moves often occur in oversold conditions. Hence, if I have to decide, it could be a down move into the 510-520 area after the earnings and then a reversal up afterwards. A break below 510 will be leading to a further crash. Great question. We also outlined the downoption in the previous weeks verbally, we just did not show it in the two first charts.  #Bitcoin price forecasts: New, special public review published: Read it here: http://bit.ly/o9l3MV this is a great project. well done so far BitcoinBull,it was very expected that prices break 5.2 $ fast, which is what we shared in our newsletter Thursday night to subscribers. It contains a stock market analysis The new weekly bitcoin report is out now. Today it includes a special. Simple question to you? Are you a subscriber? If not, I am happy to offer a trial month for you My definition of "Exciting" does not relate to bullish nor bearish. Instead, it means that there is more trading activity which I find exciting big bullish move today... exciting times as promised :-) thanks. the history playback window appears but then it is so fast that I can make any use of it - no matter which settings I use..any idea how to slow down the replay? it is difficult to predict timings, but in terms of price, I predict bitcoin will have exceeded 32 $ within the next 12 months. "alert" is used as it is related to the imminent nature of price action, and this does not give any indication about direction. subscribers know what this is about. Interesting speculation about my analysis :-), but not true why down?
 Short term alert sent to subscribers. great! a bit offtopic, but: maybe we should set a bounty for the one who cracks the 5 $ mark.. this is definitely awesome and could help bringing new users into bitcoins.How are you going to create some public awareness about this very easy access to bitcoins? you should invest some of your profits into marketing bitcoin again above the 50 day exponential moving average.. will it hold above this time? if yes, this could be bullish That is all fine, but to trigger the rally, there needs to be strong, and sustained buying volume does anyone know how to create a trading history video with Sierra charts? (other than slowly recreating the chart and video taping it manually) now we see some more activity (just issued a short term update to subscribers an hour ago) The newsletter is out to subscribers... I am excited... yes, it can take some time, but that's fine The waves are fully on track. It just is not necessary to analyse this market every minute in times like this. The larger wave counts are very clear, and the low volatility is going to end... The Apple stock will fail = fall big time in the next months, and it will drag the entire market down big time Thanks so much for the great feedback. I'll do my best to keep it up The bitcoin weekly report is out to subscribers.If someone whats to subscribe, contact me here:http://bit.ly/oGVMrh  new short term update for bitcoin prices and bitcoin charts analysis sent to subscribers the moment it looks as if stagnation is the new name of the game,.. bitcoin trading becomes more volatile.The stagnation might last another couple of days, but I am sure we will see 10% to 20%+ moves (Edit: up or down) within the next 2 weeks Both, markets will (1) fall like a stone and (2) will be dirupted with trrading halts, closure of exchanges. This is also a big risk. Because even if you are on the right side of the trade, if exchanges / banks are closing, you may not get any funds out any more.This is where the alternative Bitcoin comes into play.  I agree with you that we will soon see major market turbulence across the board This week's bitcoin newsletter is out for subscribers. enjoy it. interesting, but I will not get into thisBy the way, just sent a new short term bitcoin prices and bitcoin charts analysis to subscribers
today could be a turn day.. "turnaround tuesday again" It's interesting that after a while of absence of huge walls, we see a wall again. Maybe the so called "manipulator" is back. ok Good point. I am happy to provide some tracking of all calls, be it right or wrong The expected move has just started It's over. The next time goverments will fail to prevent deflation. In fact, the have already lost this battle. This week's bitcoin charts and bitcoin prices newsletter is out, containing a very special part. Apple indeed confirmed the bearish hanging man from yesterday in the end. Once many people want to exit Apple and stock market longs, the door is narrow, and many won't get out before we are down a LOT. In the same APPL chart above, there is a small hanging man on March 1, 2012 which led to a -5% decline over the following 3 days. The next turn in APPL will likely be bigger... Typically, yes. Of course there are always some exceptions possible, but probability is high for a turn.This turn has to be confirmed by a down day or at least a dark candle tomorrow. A hammer in an uptrend is called hanging man and is bearish, signalling often an impending downturn.A hammer in a downtrend often signals an impending upturn.http://www.investor-verlag.de/boersenwissen/die-kerzen-5-und-6/ Today was a hanging man. Maybe apple is hung tomorrow...http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hangingman.asp#axzz1pguH7KSk love it :-)I want more customer pictures!  Hey buddy Cograts to the great call. And now we are finally aligned :-) +1 We still have a very fractured market after the weak close of the stock market. At least a sharp short term decline is going to happen very soon. This is true. Some subscribers prefer this way to alert them of a new update. customers are the king Another interim bitcoin charts update has just been sent to subscribers. http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/index.htmlFrom yesterday, I usually do not communicate every time I do a change on the site.  Just issued a interim bitcoin charts update with short and mid term bitcoin prices outlook to subscribers.
We have something in common. I started a big short yesterday, too. NDX and SPX Yes, next week will be very exciting.i.e. see the SKEW spike: http://chart.ly/6u9kllw 1. The Eurostoxx for example. In fact, almost all European markets are down vs. 2011 (Germany, UK, France, etc.), and Europa accounts for a huge part of global stock market volume.2. Further, Most Asian markets are down vs. 2011(China, India, etc.) Basically we only have the US up, which is a negative divergence, unless rest of world quickly catched up with the US markets. Thanks for your great perspective. I agree with you that fighting the trend is not often warranted. But it is exactly because of that that I went short. All key markets remain WAY BELOW their all time highs and most markets remain below the 2007 highs and also most are even still below the 2011 highs. The decade long trend is down and hence this short is with the trend long term.But you are right on the mid and short term. The trend is up unless proven otherwise. The next 5 trading days will likely tell more. Probably even tomorrow is a big turn day. I know, No worries, I just remembered this bad tooth day and I wanted to share this suffering experience :-) I went in and out two of times, taking small losses as I was too early. Today, I shorted again big time S&P at 1401.6. Possible we will see tomorrow yet another small pop, but this does not worry me.Thanks for keep tracking those trades, keeps me alert. My stop is 1447. Target below 500.  Out now...!!!I never missed a single report since almost 12 months, except when I communicated a 1 day delay once because I had to go to the dentist surgery, and I can tell you, I would have preferred bitcoins instead..Enjoy it. This last time is not allowed per Elliott Wave guidelines. Wave A's subwaves 1 and 4 are overlapping. And also, the proportions don't look right.  Up on all time scales voila .The forecast has fully materialzed. I am not saying I am right, just saying that this would be a springboard to create a big short squeeze. The shorts below 5 $ are a great bait for bulls, if they decide to take it... good chart. prices need to quickly move above 5 $ to keep this the active count. It is entirely possible to see another dip first. At the same time, it is important to note that we are in a longterm BITBULL market. And if we are really already in major Elliott wave III up, then surprises typically come to the upside. It "only" takes 100 k$ to break 5 $. And there are 1.3 $MM in the order book, so if people decided to go long, there is rally potential.You can also make the counter argument as there are enough BTC in the order book to drive price down.We will see soon which is the next big move. It will be coming, as volatility is almost at all time lows - and this will change. Congrats!!!! Thanks for the feedback. I have to admit that I got a bit too emotional...EDIT. And you are also right that it is normal to have some haters. And I have observed that these appear typically around major changing points.  Agree Cypher.And soon we will see  a strong inverse correlation of BTC and stocks >> Blitzboom. 100% agree this is a great idea and even better linking it to Gavin's proposed foundation Stable would be good for bitcoin merchants, but realistically, this is not going to happen at current levels. More likely there will be wild swings in the next couple of years before there is some stabilization.
I agree with you.The bitcoin market is small, but way to big for my analysis to move the market in any significant way. The forecast only works if the analysis is spot on. I have observed  that if my forecast is wrong, the market tells me quickly. Fortunately my analysis is more right that wrong.  This is why it is important to stay up-to-speed to the market. Things change, depending on recent price action. Thanks for the feedback. Strong recommendations are our preference. At the same time, it is important to protect the assets in times of consolidations / corrections, as they provide too many false signals.  We just issued an interim bitcoin charts and bitcoin price forecast good point, we are truly global :-)So let ne clarify. There will be an update in the next 36 hours Dear Subscribers,watch out for updates over the weekend. We may see exciting times coming... The foundation of technical analysis is that past price patterns can be used to predict the future. The charts with past price development have been very useful to predict the future, and so they will today.I am happy to reconvene with you after 6-12 months to demonstrate the extend of the crash that happened What exactly do you mena with "I am not buying this?" Here is a stock market update. Big picturehttp://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/blog.html bitcoins sent   We just issued an interim bitcoin charts and bitcoin price forecast to subscribers. Blitzboom. thanks a lot. you won! It would really be interesting to find out how many people are trading bitcoins.Does anyone have an idea how to find it out?I give a bounty of 10 BTC for the one with the most accurate information. Sent a short term alert to subscribers. We just issued the weekly bitcoin charts analysis report to subscribers. Exciting times ahead. as expected in the short term update, at least a small rally is underway I will make it bigger. Sorry for that. Just issued a short term update to subscribers. Just to clarify. I do not imply that you have poor quality. I was only responding to realnowhereman as he was addressing me personally in this  thread. As you have seen before, I have not gotten in your thread before and I won't unless people talk about me again. 
I agree with you. Competition is great. But quantity does not equal quality.  I get repeatedly great customer feedback since the start of the service and and my customer base is increasing every month since the start. The poll is reset again.What is your view on bitcoin prices over the next weeks?Up?Down?Same as now?Don't know? Scenario ii) is the one... We just issued an interim update to subscribers. not  a bad idea. In fact, the triangle I was predicting is currently almost perfectly forming. even though I was predicting it, I could not believe my eyes how mass bitcoin psychology really works so perfectly Thanks Mushoz, you are right, this does not influence at all the technical analysis.In fact, the bitcoin market has been quite straightforward to predict over the past 1.5 years - as it displays great "textbook-like" patterns. I meant the two updates to subscribers from Feb 18. Sorry for the confusion. The forecast we issued today and yesterday to subscribers is fully on track. We charge a fee because we work hard on a daily basis and often including the weekend to provide state-of-the art technical analysis. Our purpose is to equip people interested in bitcoin with tools to be on the right side of the market more often than on the wrong side. Here is a new bitcoin mid term chart analysis and forecast http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/And also, for new people interested (i) to receive bitcoin price forecasts and (ii) trading advice and training: You can get a -40% trial offer for 3 BTC if you subscribe until Feb 22:http://bit.ly/qJDsYw We just issued the second update to subscribers for today, including a new in depth Elliott Wave analysis and two competing short and mid term scenarios.If any new person wants to subscribe, there is a 3 BTC trial period for the first month. Just send an email to S3052@gmx.ch I agree, there is more bearish potential unless 4.8 $ and even more importantly, 5.5 $ are broken to the upside. I have the same problem on an international wire transfer from MtGox. This is unacceptable. In fact, after clarifying what you mean, we AGREE 100% :-)I agree that BTC is NOT correlated to the stock market. My only point was that the BTCUSD market can be analysed well using techniques known from stock markets and other financial markets, namely technical analysis I violently disagree, the past 18 months of technical analysis of the bitcoin markets has shown that it can be analyzed and predicted in the same way as the stock market and other financial markets. Herding behavior and psychology is the same everywhere.  Again, Elliott wave theory has helped tremendously to anticipate the sell off over the past 48 hours.Here is the chart posted to subscribers before the break down: And here is the updated chart afterwards:We are also announcing a special 3 for 2 winter promotion:For 9.90 BTC, you will get 3 months of subscription- for the price of less than 2 normal monthly fees. Just send an email to S3052@gmx.ch and pay by Feb 16, midnight. You will get a dedicated BTC address from us. Every analysis we do, be it for subscribers only or for the public contains unbiased analysis based on technical analysis methods, and this can be verified by the charts we display. If anyone disagrees with our analysis, they are all free to post their alternative. >>>Blitzboom.The market is still too thin to profit from tiny short term moves well enough. This is why we provide a NEUTRAL outlook between 5.3 and 6.1 $. And we provided the same analysis to subscribers and to the public, with the only difference the delay, as we promise to subscriber to get all info first.We are sure that soon there will be great trading opportunities.  brief update:While still bullish mid and long term, the technical picture is deteriorating short term.Some key trendlines are broken: see chart here http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/There are two clear options.1) Decline from current levels or2) If 6.1 $ is broken: then Rally. but there is no need to be LONG until this has happened
While still bullish mid and long term, the technical picture is deteriorating short term.Some key trendlines are broken: see chart here http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/There are two clear options.1) Decline from current levels or2) If 6.1 $ is broken: then Rally. but there is no need to be LONG until this has happened 5.6 $ is not a big support area beyond the the very short term.As we shared with subscribera last night, some key trendlines are broken and there is a strong possibility for another short term selloff. I agree with many of you. The technical strength of the bitcoin market has been impressive lately. I will analyse the market in depth today and provide short and mid term trading scenarios in today's weekly report. Thanks for sharing. There are always many way to count the waves...The most important thing is not to be right all the time in the predictions of the waves, but to create profits.Right now, the better risk / reward relationship is to be short. I waited quite a while for this opportunity and now here we are. Shorting 1344 has a approx. 2% stop loss (1371). Reward is minimum down to 1280-1300 (3.3 - 5%), and if it was the big top, much more. No worries. I have nothing to hide.As you can see , I outlined two options. The market decided for the second option, but I still favor the bearish resolution from current levels up to 1353 DOWN. And this option remains valid as long at 1370 holds.I am 90% convinced that we will see at least a strong top pattern this week.Net a tradable scenario can be to short 1340-1352 with a stop above 1370.EDIT: Above 1370 is bullish with some more upside, before eventually the crash arrives. This will not invalidate it, just delay the crash. Target remains below 500 for the S&P500 we believe the answer is yes.We are in a bull market since November as long as 3.3 / 3.8 $ holds.And short term, there is a golden cross above 5.3 - 5.4 $ There are various possible interpretations in the short term.However, the most likely resolution is to the upside. The key question remains: will bitcoins turn up from current levels or will they fall deeper before reversing up? To remain fair to people paying for the analysis, can you please stop sharing information from the paid service.Thank you. no single entity can prevent market forces.this is true for the stock market where the FED will be failing to keep stock prices inflatedand it is true for bitcoin... We also have a (lighter) version of clarkmoody's charts on http://www.bitcoinbulbear.com Chodpaba,CONGRATS!!!You opened the 100th page of this thread, and even with a great picture.I still remember the day when I opened the thread and bitcoin was only having few followers and the BTCUSD price was 0.1 $.Amazing times.. It is important to note that there are times when a neutral stance is warranted, and there are times when a clear probability is given.This also depends on the time frame.We have a clear bias in the mid and long term picture.While short term it is neutral until key trigger levels are violated. I agree. At the same time, I want to stress that the private updates should remain private and not revealed here. Juts issued an interim bitcoin technical analysis update in the subscriber section. It is normal that shortly after a price surge that there is some void on the bid side.As mentioned before, I would not rely too much on the orderbook. It gives too many false signals and can be manipulated too easily. +1There is a history about my bitcoin forecasts that shows bullishness and bearishness when the analysis and the time warranted it.  We just issued the weekly bitcoin price analysis and newsletter to subscribers.Exciting times ahead of us! brief update: http://bit.ly/xBq5et Genau. Das ist sehr wahrscheinlich. This is true, but reality.A more narrow, short term range is 6.1 - 6.5 $. A breakout of this range would be the first sign of a stronger move.
At one point, a next rally leg will most likely come, and it should be very strong.But until 7.22 $ is cleared to the upside, there remains a neutral trading range down to 4.64 $. This means that there remains a risk for another short term sell off, before the mid term up trend continues. We just issued a short term update to subscribers.How to subscribe:http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/bitcoin-subscriptions.html +1 There is a good chance it won't stop at 9.7 $ but hit 10 $  it is important to remain agile in technical analysis.once we saw that the triangle interpretation was not what the marked respected, we issued a short term alert, on time before the drop. +1000.No one could have said it better. There is no crash and the consolidation above 6.5 could be a great and one of the last buying opportunites before a breakout. Bitcoin prices have just broken out above the 200 d moving average.8$ mas not be of big resistanceand 10 $ is not far away. Here is a brief public bitcoin technical analysis update. http://bit.ly/xBq5et There is enough cash in the MtGox market already to move the rally to double digits Now the 7.2 $ resistance is down to only 24 k BTC = 150 k $, not that much anymore... I agree on the big rally potential for bitcoins as you know.I disagree on the stock market. We may just have seen the top for years to come. Maybe the SPX touches 1300 next week as one more high and then it will fall like a stone. but also the most unlikely. if we are in wave III up this will be huge and is has just started This is entirely possible... Looking at the order book does not provide so much valuable information as proven in the past. It is better to focus on price action and other technical indications. Clark,for me the ads work perfectly fine. They are all financial ads (Gold, Silver, etc.)  http://www.tradersedgeindia.com/elliott_wave_theory.htm#trianglehttp://www.wavaholic.com/2010/01/elliott-wave-rules-and-guidelines.html Triangles are indeed fun.. , because if the triangle interpretation is correct, then it is a great and easy way to trade. But what if it is not a triangle.It is always good to check for alternate possibilities. Then listing all possibilities and trying to determine the most likely one. Just looking at one option often leads to failure.As an example, here is the alternative possibility to the above triangle option. I prefer the below option to the triangle above does not conform to all the rulesIf this was correct, we would soon see a rally in wave (iii) Initially I thought it could be another triangle, but with triangles, I always want to see proper a, b, and c waves and then d and e need to be in line as well.It started with a proper a and b, but then it was invalidated as wave c did go above the high of wave b, which is not allowed. This was on Jan 8 at around 4 PM, then I knew it will not be a proper triangle. it's quite normal to see some corrections and they can start anytime, particularly when you saw a 350% rally in a matter of days or a couple of weeks like we saw from the bitcoin price low of 1.994 $ up to 7.22 $...
it was not a right triangle, and it turned out to develop into a flat correction. 5.8 - 6 $ is good support Here the bitcoin technical analysis answer on those people in the media  who called bitcoin death just some weeks ago.You can discuss in the blog here No worries :-)Very short term, you were right that 7.20 was resistance.Mid term, not. I agree with most people here that 7.2 $ is only a minor resistance. Thanks, always trying my best to support the bitcoin economy, whether prices are due to fall or rise.By the way:To all:If you have a suggestion for an interesting topic about financials / trading, etc. related to Bitcoins, let me know. It may be appropriate for another article. Thank you for the constructive feedback.It is important to note that the analysis itself is in fact unbiased. It follows technical analysis and a multitude of indicators that are pointing to exactly that outcome.As an analyst, I take a certain stance depending on the analysis and for people who have been following me since the beginning, they know that I also take a fully bearish stance if it is warranted.Hence, while it may sound euphoric, the conclusion of recent price action and the unbiased technical analysis points to a bullish bias... What I will do next time is to add some comments about the alternate scenario, something like what if ... Not sure if this is treated like a news and I let you decide if its relevant, here a recent article from Friday:http://hawaiinewsdaily.com/2012/01/breakout-in-the-bitcoin-race/ wonderful!!! Proposal for a new expression: "bitcoined" = screwed by bitcoins, i.e.USD's are bitcoined on bitcoinica at the moment :-) whats wrong with bitinstant?the website is not available any more.. I have shared with subscribers a wave count, but I am sorry I can't share here as it is exclusive to subscribers. This is correct and by the way, it was really not  a bubble in logarithmic terms which is the more appropriate way to chart assets that show exponential rises in very short time.And, bubbles or however people call strong rises, can not be avoided. Herding psychology is human and can never be avoided in free markets.  Indeed, would be nice to pay cablecars, apres-ski vodka-lemon or jagertee with bitcoins... HAPPY NEW YEAR to all.I was in the snow in the mountains :-) happy new year to everybody and thanks for all the trustAs of today, we have added live charts in http://bitcoinbullbear.com, thanks to Clark Moody.Looking forward to a rocking BITYEAR :-) We gave a sell reco in the 1850-1900 area, so our forecast has already materialized. More downside ahead of us. thanks slush.Unfortunately, I also do not know how to do this automatically, since I created the chart manually (based on monthly prices).A while ago, I downloaded some data from yahoo.financedid you try this yet? here is a new chart, comparing bitcoins vs. Gold.http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/index.html here is a new chart, comparing bitcoins vs. Gold.http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/index.html it takes about 200 $k to hit 5 $ at the moment. There are enough funds on MtGox already. If people decide to have fun holiday trading,and have BTC before masses add funds to MtGox in the new year, we may hit 5 $ soon:Guess: Dec 29, 2011
bitcoin prices below 3 $ would be rather bearish at this stage It would be boring if all would agree with me  The market will decide who is right or wrong. In my p.o.v the market dynamics have changed a lot. The current rise is very healthy , supported by strong volume.Sure it will not go up in a straight line. There will be corrections along the way, but I see likelihood of 60-65% that we will not see bitcoin prices below 2 $ in the next weeks and months any more. More details and alerts in the subscriber section. As long as the market is the market, it will not listen to wishes of individuals. Markets are driven by psychology of market participants.People also wish for slow, 5-10% appreciation of stocks every year for decades, but it does not happen very often. There are always mini bubbles, medium bubbles and big bubbles on the way. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1493.msg655006#msg655006 correct. As we expressed many times in the subscriber section, the reversal from the 2 $ is very strong and can lead to mid term upside to 13.5 $ (38.2% retrace), 17 $ (50% retrace) and 20.6 $ (61.8% retrace).  It's true, I mentioned that Silver is going to top in May an followed up on http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/stocks-metals-etc.html in August and September that it's going down even more. New public bitcoin charts and bitcoin prices forecast: http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/ Yes, based on gold chart analysis, gold has just broken a major trendline and we will soon see declines to the low 1500 and then 1300 I personally do not think anyone need to rush to buy Silver. I will pick them up when we have silver prices below 10 $. bitcoins and gold are not really linked strongly.the reasons why I think bitcoins go up and gold down in the neat term are different:Bitcoin is in a short and mid term uptrend, technically. And fundamentally, we see more real uses for bitcoin every day. A recent example is the launch of http://bitcoindeals.com/ with almost 400,000 products to shop online, similar to amazon.Gold is in a strong downtrend and has more room to fall, at least to 1300, again, technical reasons.Fundamentally, I am bullish gold, but it will take some time until it makes sense to buy again, perhaps in 6 -24 months, but not before  If you need a good Gucci or Lacoste perfume to neutralize your cigarette smoke, you can buy it for bitcoins at http://bitcoindeals.com No invite needed any more. It is live:http://bitcoindeals.comHere is the tweet:Shop from your phone and buy yourself a holiday gift with bitcoin. We're live with 375,000 products! http://bitcoindeals.com I am flattered, but no: I do not even have the basic computer skills to do any bot thing. correct, dollar notes are the place to be for meand bitcoins It is non sensible to recommend gold at this stage.Seasonality comes and goes and changes very often.Be careful about gold.Very likely you can buy it much cheaper in the next months around 1300 , or even 1000 and below.Oursell signal we gave on bitcoinbullbear.com is still active. 1 BTC thrown in by me I pledge another 1 BTC for the 100,000 viewer.And if this can't be tracked in time, we will postpone to the 111,111 viewer or 150,000 ... Cypher,thanks a lot. much appreciated.And by the way, your blog is great! If we are really in major wave 3 up, then 3 digits are entirely possible. but lets first see a rise above 4-5 $, then 10$, and retest 32 $. then we can talk higher targets  zby and others:this is exactly the reason why I do not count the minor subwaves. the risk for error is too high.I have focused more on the bigger picture which told me that the likelihood is very high that we will enter a major rally.I think we are in the wave 3 up now which will be much stronger than wave 1 (and wave 1 was +56% !!!)Some people may be surprised if BTCUSD slices through 4 $ like butter.
Overall, there is probably not a strong correlation.At the same time, in case many big players in the bitcoin market are also heavily invested in the stock market and other risky assets, when all these crash (which I believe will happen big time), then they may also need to convert BTC back to cash to compensate.But as said, this is a small fraction of the players.And even more likely, there can be huge money inflows from investors who abandon the stock market and precious metals when they see that BTC is more promising.I.e. bitcoin prices have mid term upside back to the all time highs, which can be a 10x increase. Just an example. They wont get those returns with Gold, Silver, stocks. It is entirely possible that the downturn starts before xmas. Almost everyone expects a Santa rally, perhaps optimism is too high for this to materialize.But anyway, if the plunge protection team (PPT) in the US is successful again to spark a Santa rally, in January this will be completely retraced. New Stock market outlook: 2012 will bring the crash in the stock market // see here: http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/stocks-metals-etc.html We have just issued a new bitcoin chart and bitcoin price forecast to subcribers I am happy to look into it if you like I focus on providing the technical analysis and I am only exchanging BTC / USD occasionally to manage the income I receive from subscribers. short term is when we use hourly charts of typically past 10 days as basis fir our analysis.The 4 - 5 $ zone could be reached within the next 10 days in principle.To keep This Outlook alive, BTCUSD should make strong progress toward this this week. Sure, I will do! Bitcoin Charts and Bitcoin Prices Update released to subscribers. How to subscribe: http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/bitcoin-subscriptions.html that sounds great. Brilliant! :-)By the way, more seriously, I do think that we will only have short-lived trading ranges in the months to come.btcusd will remain very volatile. where is the 9000-10000 button :-) It takes a bit to get used to it, I agree.I also agree with some other posts that MtGox should now focus on making deposits and withdrawals MUCH FASTER and MUCH MORE RELIABLE. New all time high here: above 80% bullishnesshttp://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/index.html NZD/EUR looks like if it is about to rally to new highs. Very bullish. this isnothing yet .double digit btcusd values will easily be reached - not in a straight line, but in a stair step pattern   I am short EUR/USD since 1.41 and keep that position. We may see 1.2 and lower in the next weeks and months sorry, may I ask you to do it again? I forgot to reset.And as a benefit, I will issue a new sentiment analysis in the next days, making the link to the most likely direction of the bitcoin market.

Nagle just called me and said that it will be -1.5 $ tomorrow. What you expressed above happens very often, basically kicking out the weak hands and this leads to very strong and healthy moves.False signals are very frequent in all financial markets, and the art is to differentiate between false and real signals. what if you are wrong?Even if bitcoins would continue the mid term downtrend, a small 38.2% fibonacchi retracement will lead to a minimum bounce target of 13$.we will see bear ribs as barbecue bezüglich der euro einschaetzung stimm ich dir 100% zu.ich habe das ganze zitat der vollständigkeit halber kopiert, nicht weil es meine meinung ist :-) interessante einschätzung:Zitat:"Habe gerade die Antwort auf meine Anfrage an einen bayrischen Rechtsanwalt bzgl Bitcoins als Handelswährung und  deren  allfälliger Versteuerung erhalten. Seine PRIVATE Meinung ohne genaueres Nachforschen über allfällige Feinheiten ist in etwa Folgendes:In einem  Rechtsstaat ist prinzipiell alles erlaubt, das nicht ausdrücklich verboten ist bzw nicht gegen die allgemeinen Sitten und Gebräuche verstößt (ist das bayrisch?)Da der bitcoin kein gesetzliche anerkanntes Zahlungsmittel ist, wären Geschäfte, die ausschließlich mit BTCs getätigt werden, seiner Ansicht nach auch nicht versteuerbar, da die Einnahme von BTCs in keiner staatlich anerkannten Währung erfolgen. Da der Euro auch durch nichts anderes mehr gedeckt ist als durch die staatliche Autorität, müßte diese staatliche Autorität auch den BTC als Währung anerkennen, um davon einen staatlichen Anteil, sprich Steuern, einfordern zu dürfen. Er meint, daß ein allfälliger Musterprozeß ein riesiger Spaß sein könnte ... (bayrischer Humor  :-))Da der BTC genauso wie der Euro nicht staatlich, sondern privat generiert wird, spräche für eine Anerkennung  an sich nichts dagegen, es wäre allerdings diese Anerkennung wohl gleichzeitig der Todesstoß für den Euro -- herrlich (dies ist MEINE private Meinung dazu)Der Staat - die Staaten - werden also gewaltig in die Zwickmühle kommen, wenn sie vor der Alternative stehen - anerkennen und den Euro killen oder nicht anerkennen und auf zunehmende Einnahmen verzichten und den Euro langsam killen .....obs stimmt, werden wir merken, wenn die Umsätze in BTCs zu wachsen beginnen - vor allem, da sie weder zentral gesteuert (und daher zentral unterbunden werden können) noch auf lokale Einsatzgebiete wie Komplementärwährungen beschränkt sind .. so oder so -- verbieten sie ihn oder lassen sie es laufen, ab einer bestimmten Menge (Spieletheorie, hier läge sie bei etwa 30-40% des Privatkonsums) killt er unser Schuldgeldsystem und die Herrschaft der privaten Zentralbanken!"http://www.wahlfieber.at/de_du/forum/Bundestagswahl/5356/24/#posting24 probably in the next 1-3 weeks if the 2.4 - 2.6 $ zone holds This has all the ingredients for a sustainable reversal. If this is the case, 4-5 $ will be reached soon. WOW. Congrats from me as well if you manage to have credit card deposits. I can easily see bitcoin prices taking off big time behind this. Some years ago I was similarily surprised like you about the predictive power of Elliott Waves.A great book that uncovered the fundamentals behind it is Elliott Wave PrincipleKey to Market Behavior http://www.elliottwave.com/books/ewp/default.aspx?code=ecgThis will probably answer some of your questions (I have no affiliation with ElliottWave.com or Robert Prechter)                      cool. This fact alone is worth a short news article! wonderful news, too bad I can't join you.make sure you report back EVRYTHING :-) and the other hand, there are just 100 k$ needed to reach 3$, which would probably threaten even more short sellers nice breakout we are seeing..could see more upside fast Thanks This is a wonderful service.Just one question. It does not work today any more. Any idea what is wrong or if this issue is only happened at my computer? If we will enter the big third wave III since start of bitccoin trading, then the "recovery" will be VERY FAST and VERY SHARP A smart way to outsmart him could be to place bids BELOW his Bidwalls, not above :-) unless the manipulator has unlimited funds, this issue will disappear naturally once more funds are added by more investors and traders.The couple of hundredthousands he has in mtgox are still small overall in the financial world.But you are right, there must be first some kind of trust of new investors... Or: one big investor just has the guts to make the manipulator look like a fool, with one big 500 k investment.We know that this happens in the bitcoin economy. Back in Dec 10 - Apr 11 this is what actually happened. BRILLIANT INTERVIEW, Roger
Bitcoin technical analysis based on the bitcoin charts has proved to be extremeley successful to predict future prices moves. Believe it or not. You are so right.One way to play this could be to position with  a portion already now and buy the rest either (i) if prices go down to 2$ or a bit below one more time, or (ii) rally without ever revisiting 2 $.In any case, the next rally will be huge in percentage terms. I is quite likely that he wants to manipulate the price down. If he was interested to make bitcoin prices rise, he could use his $ purchase power to trigger a couple of forced short liquidations and prices would shoot up massively. This might be true again, but I more and more doubt it. Bitcoin prices more more and more away from the downtrendlines and there is an upward explosion to come.It might be from yet another low, or never go below 2 $ at all any more.But whatever the short term wiggles are, an upward explosion will come soon and create a huge short squeeze. Great. I would love to see this statement also from MtGox and other exchanges. Cool. Thanks so much for the clarification. Seems like you a shorting bitcoins yourself.If this is true, I am not sure this is right, as owner of bitcoinica.Can you clarify, please? This is quite possible, and if so, then there is a huge short squeeze possible as cypherdoc has mentioned in a  separate thread. Interesting thought. I'd like to just comment on one thing: "Once bitcoin ceases to be used as a speculative vehicle.." This won't happen, at least not as long there are exchanges up and running. A friend told me that Bitcoin was mentioned again in ElliottWave.com 's Theorist that was issued on 11-18-2011. If someone is a subscriber, he may be able to post the article.This mention could again spark some investor interest. I could not agree more to that. The poll is reset.What is your view?Up?Down?Same as now?Don't know?Also, sign in for free here if you like to be closer to the analysis:http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forum.html#/news/ Vandroiy: Just to clarify: There is nothing wrong with speculating at current levels for a bounce to 4-5 $ which means 100% profit. All I am saying is that we distinguish between investment outlook (currently bearish until 4-5 $ are cleared) and short term trading where we give multiple buy and sell recos within a week. And this includes short term buying as well. no, you should be able to register without facebook or google. Agree, cluster.It is about the symbiosis of 1) more investors and 2) a sustainable growth in the bitcoin economy. Netrin: you are doing great with Elliott Wave analysis. Have you thought about a thread here: http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forum.html#/news/ While I don't agree on the desire to harm bitcoin overall, I do agree that your theory is one viable option(and I cleaned up your post via removing all your ebay stuff).The person has so much market power that he can make money via this tactics. He probably has the lowest fees on MtGox and hence can make money with lowest spreads.The only way to change this is to attract more people to buy bitcoins. Once the "manipulator = big trader" does not have such a big market power any more, its over for him.  ANNOUCEMENT:We started a forum on http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/forum.html#/news/.After running for over 14 months the bitcoin technical analysis thread in this forum (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1493.1600), now you have the opportunity to discuss bitcoin technical analysis related matters on our website. This will fulfill two benefits: (1) members here can really fully focus on trading related subjects and (2) avoid being in a "child" subforum and avoid the numerous off topic posts. It is for this reason that we will preserve the right to delete posts that do not fulfill the objective of this thread rigorously. Looking forward to a great discussing about the future of bitcoin prices, bitcoin forecasts, chart analysis, technical indicators, and more. :-) But more seriously, my analysis is not about betting.It is a bout investing and trading to maximize returns.There are times where things are clear and times where is is not so clear.It is always better to follow the big trend and miss the first part of the reversal vs. betting on a reversal too soon, because you get burnt too often with that strategy.For new strategic bitcoin positions, one should wait for prices to rise above 4 - 5$.  You nailed it. No disagreement , but 100% agreement.People should stop whining about manipulators, etc., but rather DO SOMETHING TO ATTRACT NEW INVESTORS into bitcoins. That's the only way out of this vicious cycle.And, I hope that the Prague conference also has this as objective and not only software development.Because all this development will be useless if bitcoin prices fall more and stay down.No merchant will ever want to get in with this huge volatility and manipulation risk.
I am not saying that I like this scenario, but you are right when saying that the most likely outcome is DOWN hard.After being neutral (50/50) for two days, now its 80% likelihood for DOWN We will soon se how serious the person is who has the bid wall at 2.1 $. Selling into this wall is just starting. If this wall falls, we may enter another huge decline. All what it takes to drive btc prices up is a few investors buying btc with 200-300 k$ funds each. Our Silver forecast is nicely on track. Beware who holds Silver.http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/stocks-metals-etc.html Great, so we are 100% aligned. This is what I meant.I am quite experienced in marketing but currently lack the time to spend more time on it... To Slush:Thanks for shedding light on this. I was probably over simplifying it.I have experience in a big company (many tens of thousands of employees), but not directly in the IT area.What I really mean is that bitcoin lacks either a big company that focuses on it or having some kind of association that doesMarketingPRERetc..This could have avoided a lot of biased press coverage as there is no PR work going on, no dedicated advertising of bitcoin as such.. etc.[/list] I tend to agree with the essence of this.This is probably the biggest problem with open source projects. While open source software might be great, open source projects like bitcoin do not work at all, and are probably worst than government projects.Why? Because there is no organizational structure, no clear goals, no clear and united strategies, no clear leadership, no clear decision making.Instead, many people duplicate work without knowing and / or going different directions.The bitcoin project is the best example of this theory. Its still not that difficult to make money in this market. Looking at the charts, you dont even see any evidence for any cornering. Its just normal volatility. And its also normal that its gets more volatile on the way down.I.e. you could have sold or shorted bitcoins around 25-30 $ (I issued a sell signal on Jun 12th with target dowon to at least 5 $) and fared quite well with it.And currently, being on the short side is still a viable option. Its very unlikey that we will see a double bottom. It's more likey to see a big spike down before attempting a more sustainable reversal. I agree with you. this person probably is a very experienced trader with one of the highest capitalization in the bitcoin exchanges, and he uses this to his advantage.It would take a few additional highly capitalized traders / investors to show him that the game is over.But it does not seem like a lot of new traders / investors are getting into bitcoins... If the person(s) who have the 50,000 BTC bid on MtGox pull this out, prices will fall like a stone (or should I say falling knife) November 15, 2011: Interim Bitcoin Charts Updatehttp://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/index.html be careful not to get cut by the falling bitcoin knife People just need to buy about 80,000 BTC to get the price to 4 $. I would then consider this a technical breakout and then BTCUSD would likely rise much further. Ideally, also 5 $ is cleared soon thereafter. Althought many dream that this would remain like that, I can guarantee you that this is very temporary. We are set for huge volatility the next weeks, months and probably years to come. yeah.. this is life.... its ambiguous all the time...I see your point that news are overall very bearish even in mainstream, but this fits to the third wave behavior.. third waves are "the point of recognition" where finally all is negative AND prices fall (and the contrarian view does not work anymore, expect for short term bounces from oversold conditions) It is interesting that one can make many arguments for the bullish case and as many strong ones also for the bearish case. I believe not 60%, not 80% , but at least 95% in the bearish case for stocks. And this is not in any way going against you personally, but solely about different p.o.v's. we will see soon what has been the right call.For me, I am short again the NDX since 2392 with huge leverage. So far so good :-)But I will liquidate the short position above 2406. Not a lot to lose, but a lot to win if stocks dive. AAPL as leading stock (today down 10.8 $) has made a nice island gap and unless it will be filled, will lead stocks down hard. As you may have seen, I issued a sell on APPL right after the earnings at 405 $.And... I am long USDCHF which shows a strong impulsive wave UP and this pair is a leading indicator for the stock market and the DXY. net, I disagree 100% with your bias :-)).... cypher,on which time scale do you see a bull flag? Correct. The financial crash that is just in its baby phase is not helpful for bitcoins. Instead, many people who could be investing in bitcoins are also heavily invested in stocks and / or precious metals. And as all assets crash, including Silver and to some extend even Gold, this reduces available risky capital left for bitcoin.Bitcoin need to show greater strength vs. other assets first to attract again more investment. There are multiple options in the short term and this leads to a lot of uncertainty in the outlook.This is why it is best to step back and let the market make a decision.Long and mid term charts are still all pointing down .A prudent investor would either wait until btcusd rises above 5$ or wait until the pattern becomes clearer.
The short term picture offers two alternating views, one up and one down. you have to subscribe to find out more If the market wants to move in a certain direction, you and a couple of others will not be able to hold it up. Bitcoin is no different to other financial markets from a technical / charting perspective.  You may be right that BTCUSD may hold below 4 $ for a bit more, but in the next 1-12 weeks (yes, I know it's a broad range) we will see a rise into the 6 (edit)-10 $ range. record highs in which asset? can you specify what you mean? I know, but this is all priced in into the current exchange rate (existing and expected future use of bitcoin are included already).This means that currently, there is no big belief that it will become mainstream. If it would we'd see massively rising prices in anticipation of this. here the latest outlook. its quite possible to soon be able to get 10,000 BTC for less than 20$khttp://www.bitcoinbullbear.com great initiative.we need more farmers doing that, and beyond Greece. correct. At this minute, one can get 10,000 BTC for 31 k$."Buy 10000 BTC for 31014.53 USD" as per the calculator http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/mtgoxUSD_depth.html Fully agree. The WHEN is the question, not if.But my preferred forecast assumes that S&P 500 does not rise above 1300 any more and will get to low triple digits / high double digits in the next 2-3 years.  I should have written this more precisely. What I meant was that last week, prices reached the target with the high of 3.83 $.Here is the short term alert that I gave to subscribers on Oct 21, 2011:"As forecast, bitcoin prices broke out from the declining wedge andgained 20% in short time.Now, a sustained rise above 2.6 - 2.7 $ will open up much more upsidepotential (see attached chart).Stop loss remains just under 2.04-2$ $ (major support), while the 2.45(62h moving average) and 2.3 $ also provide support now.We will turn mid or long term bullish after a break above 4 $."and the attached chart Can you post here where you see a potential golden cross? (which chart, which averages, which timescale? thank you  New public update published bitcoinbullbear.com/index.html blog.bitcoinwatch.com exactly. There will be huge volatility coming. this is correct.Elliott Wave analysis is an art, not a robotic model.And this is why some people are successful using it for price forecasts and trading and some aren't .Just like many people play tennis and not all are in the top 10. green: the volume if prices are up in the intervalred: prices down Here a analysis as also shared in another thread, but it belongs here very well as well:As promised, some feedback on your EW count.Overall, I see the longterm wave count the same as you netrin: I: big rise from Aug '10 to Jun '11. II: correction Jun '11 to date, III: huge rally once II is over.The only small issue is that the wave II correction can not be counted exactly that way.Wave a can't be counted in 5 waves and this is why the current c wave will also not be a 5 wave move. Wave II is not a simple a-b-c zigzag, but rather a more complex correction, i.e. a "double three". As promised, some feedback on your EW count.Overall, I see the longterm wave count the same (I: big rise from Aug '10 to Jun '11. II: correction Jun '11 to date, III: huge rally once II is over).The only small issue is that the wave II correction can not be counted exactly that way.Wave a can't be counted in 5 waves and this is why the current c wave will also not be a 5 wave move. Wave II is not a simple a-b-c zigzag, but rather a more complex correction, i.e. a "double three". the biggest rallies are in bear markets = large short squeeze bounces.this bounce will again lead to a bigger stock market decline Thanks for correcting the typo.Indeed, the low of wave 4 can never be lower than the wave 1 high. there may be a rally tomorrow, but this will only be a dead cat bounce for stocks before they almost die in the next 2-3 years. Dow target below 1000 we are coming..
The Oct 23 high is higher than the Oct 30 low, which is not allowed based on the rules.here is a good overview that explains is well: Fantastic. We should call this the "ELWAR WAVE THEORY" :-) The more critical trendline is the long term uptrend line which currently runs around 4 $ (EDIT: it is already getting closer to 4.5 - 5.0 $ since the trendline is rising). This one needs to be broken from the underside now before BTCUSD can see further upside. Thanks for applying Elliott wave techniques. There are really useful to anticipate trends, while many other indicators are lagging. According to the Elliott wave rules, the count you have shown above is not allowed:The low of wave 4 can never overlap the high of wave 5.Here is a chart that I published to our subscribers 2 days ago. It shows that there are two valid possibilities (some of them are discussed by some posters also in this thread accurately):1) the rise from the 2.04 $ low was just a A-B-C correction in a continuing downtrend: MEANS NEW LOWS BELOW 2.04 $ to come.2) BTCUSD develop a series of first and second waves in a bigger uptrend. MEANS THAT THE 2.04 $ LOW WAS THE TERMINAL LOW OF THE 4 MONTHS CORRECTION AND PRICES WILL NOT MAKE A NEW LOW BELOW 2.04 $.We need to see some more price action to determine the most likely outcome. Agree with Gavin. I agree with you.And also: Exchanging fiat <--> must be much more secure and easier for everybody. I am using standard technical indicators and Elliott wave analysis successfully for bitcoin as well as stocks and metal forecasts.I.e. I just published a stock market chart indicating that we are likely in a third of a third wave down which is usually the strongest.http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/stocks-metals-etc.html this makes a lot of sense. One suggestion can be to discuss all technical factors related to bitcoin trading / investing / speculation in the bitcoin technical analysis thread.I can not review and comment all threads, but will try to be as active as possible in this one thread.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1493.1500 Great. Let's call it the bitnagle sentiment indicator.:-) we have forecast th move from 2$ to around 3.7-4$ in our short term updates an weekly analysis in the subscriber section of bitcoinbullbear.com... Almost doubled since the 2.04$ low.. welcome back Vladimir. I missed you we are predicting long term, mid term and short term trends. you can chose to not read them.there are many people wanting this service that is not true. i predicted the decline from the 32$ high, then predicted the decline to 5$ and below, giving many sell signals to subscribers.you can chose to subscribe to get all signals, or not. it is up to you./color] compared to previous walls, the ask wall at 3$ is quite small http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/index.html I have said this also many times. But unfortunately MtGox who is probably the most profitable (in absolute) bitcoin business with highest turnover, does not really do significant marketing for Bitcoins. we also predicted this move in our subscriber service and issued a short term alert about this opportunity, and confirmed this rally potential in our weekly newsletter. the pattern was clear It's quite possible that we see much more rise and what we have seen a couple of hours ago is just the beginning. News are not leading price development, but news are lagging it. This means that you cannot rely on waiting for news to trade. thats entirely possible. people buying at current levels have a -10% to -15% tight stop loss at 2$ and higher return opportunities towards 3.5-5 $.It just needs a trigger.
correct. 2$ is very strong as support and may spark a reversal.but on the other hand, I would not bank on stable prices. This ain't gonna happen. if a bounce occurs it will be massive and easily make 50-100% upside progress within hours. I agree with cypher. It is not about if, but when a short squeeze or short term big bounce up happens. Sentiment is perfectly set up for it, as most people firmly believe they can get bitcoin much cheaper, and will be surprised if the market runs away from them.. And if there is not another low soon, chances increase that a big bounce up happens soon , forcing short sellers to cover quickly. agree with you. Elliott waves, if properly understood and used, can provide an edge.Coming back to bitcoins, it seems that there may be another drop needed, probably taking out the 2$ mark and spike down hard before at least a short term bottom can be put in place. I won't comment on the Elliott wave discussion, because everyone can decide themself to use or not use it, as for any other tool.But coming back to the technical analysis, the downtrend is intense and inexperienced traders should be careful buying now .They may be lucky to pick the bottom, but most probably not.It would not be surprising to see another huge capitulation sell off drawing bitcoin prices well below 2$ and maybe even below 1$.There are some expert traders in the game using big short selling etc.Its a wild ride. and th economic downturn is hampering their pricing power could be.And on top, the economic downturn hampers their margin expectations  am curious to find out this news soon..would be great to know the exact date and time bitcoin prices will make another low at 60% probabilty and the buy trigger is quite far away: now 4$.Any buying now carries the risk of catching a falling guiliotine knife.  Agree with you.And then bitcoins move from medium-niche-on-track-to-become-mainstream to: mini-niche not good.. this is correct.the long term trend was up until it broke 2 days ago and now all trends are down hard.I wonder what is going to happen if bitcoins are ruled a currency by the European officials this week / related to th magicaltux case.This could be a bloodbath for bitcoins.. I hope it won't but its a possibility.if it I made illegal to trade and exchange without having a banking-type license prices would crash much more than they already did "First miss for $AAPL since 2002."https://twitter.com/#!/hblodget the 426.7 $ top yesterday will likely be the top that will hold for years to come. island reversal gap down tomorrow.this was it for Apple stock for a very long time do your research.  I agree with you.At the same time, traders will remain in the game. the more volatile prices are, the more it is interesting for them perhaps this is some institution trying to crash bitcoin prices to a level where many turn away from it.. and we see the media already jumping on this bandwagon and declaring its dead.so far they are very successful bump.. I suspect this is someone who is trying to sell = unload a lot of coins, trying to hold the market up so that he can complete his selling The analysis is referring to the technical condition of BTCUSD only. all technical patterns point downwards.We will alert subscribers once we see a short, mid or longterm trend change
you are right, all trends are down now Here is a post from another thread, but it belongs here.Great to engage with you in this meaty discussion.I agree with you on points 1)+2), not exactly on rules 3) + 4). Overall, this is an art as you are indicating and no one does this exactly the same. And this is why we will very likely not agree with each other on any chart, and this is fine. In the end, what really counts is that one is more often right than wrong.Now to the charts:On rule 3) and 4) Many trendlines, including the 40 year log DJI chart, even work long time after the trendlines have been touched. I have many more examples.The way you have drawn the trendlines is not really accurate. (i) When drawing trendlines you have to always start at the lows and connecting these first. Try to find  two significant lows and connect these. (ii) Then see whether you can find a 3rd or 4th touchpoint.(iii) then draw a parallel trendline connecting highs. if this looks right, you have a great parallel trendchannel.(iv) if a trendline is broken, then how will you see if this line is important? prices will accelerate the move if the line was really important. You see this in the attached. And truly, this trendline is the most valid one, because (a) prices have 4 or even 5 touchpoint lows(b) the upper parallel trendline (green) also makes sense. bitcoin prices broke out of this line end April and is now back to that level(c) prices held this line early october to Oct 15/16 and then(d) at the EXACT time when this trendline was broken for the first time in more than a year, prices crashed -40% two days ago . This is why this line has been and still will be so crucial.And what one should never forget: trendlines are there to be held and to be broken! When discussing trendlines, one must be aware of both, chances to hold and break and act (trade) accordingly.Now, looking into the future, this line will either be reclaimed fast, or it will provide strong resistance. At the minimum, the underside will likely be tested soon. This is currently around 3.7-4$.   Great to engage with you in this meaty discussion.I agree with you on points 1)+2), not exactly on rules 3) + 4).

Why do we believe that the trendline we have on the blog was the best way and most valid one?because exactly at the poinz when prices penetrated this very line the decline accelerated big time.this happened two days ago when prices declined about 40%.this shows how important the log scale  trendline was.If prices climb again above that line the trend can continue. To do so bitcoin prices need to rise above 3.7-4$Thus is nothing but impossible in the event of a short squeeze or a couple if folks with enough funds, given the low liquidity of this tiny market.Unless this happens, there continues to be a mid term downtrend .Either prices continue down or establish a  lower steepness if the longterm trend.We see new support levels establishing and we will communicate those soon. If this trend won't hold, then there are dark clouds ahead. Not only for prices but also for the bitcoin economy.While the protocol will likely still remain secure and good, bitcoin growth and adoption will likely be harmed massively Yes. Longterm trend is broken intraday.it needs a rapid reversal above 3.7$ and better 4$ to hold in the next 24 - 48h Congrats.Did you short on bitcoinica? Well done, not worrying about the last pip is the right thing.There are nice 5 waves down to 3$ and the short term reversal from there makes this a valid count.See bitcoinbullbear.com Have a great trading day. The turn took place on the short term (minute) time scale. This upmove was the strongest in many days and could be the start of a larger bounce / reversal.A move above 3.7 $ will now confirm at least another move up.see chart Active times.. We have seen a big reversal upwards. Exactly, even if it is difficult to predict the exact low short term, long term bitcoin prices are still in an uptrend.And prices are the leading indicator, not news. this means prices will move up BEFORE you see more positive news. Regarding Occupy X, the people who got interested still first need to move funds to the exchanges, and this takes some time. The ones who are already having funds on bitcoin exchanges have an advantage. One have to admit when a short term call is wrong. And yes, the alternate scenario is now the active scenario. Very few believe that there will be a strong up move once the irrational capitulation phase is over, and we will see. Weak hands are selling now, strong hands will collect the coins OR: bitcoin long term trend breaks and the entire bitcoin movement will slow down a lot. we will see.And it is exactly for this reason why I have drawn this uptrend line months ago (many have called me stupid when I said that we will test this uptrend line). and if it breaks, big problem for bitcoins. People who own bitcoins should watch this line now closely. If it will not be held, it is very bearish. we see a decline below now and the next 2-3 days are decisive. I think since we are in a short term capitulation phase, picking the exact bottom is almost impossible.Things can get very irrational now after the break of 3.71$.we may even see 1$ again. well done so far.lets see at which price you will cover or need to cover Your data is all correct.However, bitcoin usd prices lead other data points: BTCUSD leads transactions and transaction volume.And even if the bounce up will only be a small correction up from a longer term donwtrend, you are looking at an at least 38.2% retracement to 14.5 $. More standard is a 61.8% retracement which would equal to 21.2 $.And again, bitcoin prices can make another low below 3.71 $ and would still have this big upside potential.Everyone can decide for himself to wait before a breakout happens or already be in the market. ( Here is a new analysis.Short term: strong BUY rating.http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/index.htmlYou can also vote in the poll again. It is open. You could also set up mining rigs on the ground to provide heating for the folks in the parc during winter...
Once serious money flows into or out of the market prices will move strongly. forget about those mini buy or sell "walls" Thats how I see it as well...+1 to Blitzboom Thanks for the in-depth comments. I like the discussion.Regarding MACD and RSI divergences, the view follows standard technical analysis practices: if price make new lows but MACD (or RSI) not, this is a divergence.Of course, this is not the only tool and indicator. It may well be that prices do not "follow" the divergence. At the same time, as long as i) prices do not make a new low and ii) MACD and RSI do not break their trend of higher highs and lower lowsthere is a good chance that bitcoin prices will move higher quite soon.Even more more new low is allowed under this long term trend interpretation and lead to a massive upswing.And, as the bitcoin prices are coiling into a very narrow range, the following break out or breakdown (alternate scenario) will be massive and many will not believe it. +1 agree sent 15 BTC One question: Would you pay with bitcoins if prices and selection is similar to Amazon? cypher, what do you mean with "its coming?". the further gold decline? If so, i agree 100% bei trendlinine spielen einige faktoren eine rolle, unter anderem auch . ich zeige gerne einige alternativen auf, um sicherzustellen, dass auch unerfahrene trader nicht vorschnell falsche schluesse ziehen. denn gerade eine langfristige trendlinie hat immer gewisse abweichungen, und wir auch oft "verletzt". ich habe diese problemetik hier erörtert http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/.ich bin guter dinge dass die trendlinien analyse sehr gut passt, und immer noch ueberzeugt dass die linie nicht begrochen ist. denn wenn die linie bricht, dann wird dies im chart sehr sehr gut zu sehen sein, denn dann gehts scharf nach sueden. bad for mining, maybe good for bitcoin prices when supply shrinks... I am willing to donate 10 BTC to enable you going there exactly.And this is why one should look at other tools like indicators, volume, elliott waves, etc - and not only the price.In any case, we will wait and see who is right: You: Then we should not see a strong rise beyond 10 $, or me: then we should see new all time highs in the next 12 months. How much would your travel cost? or.. you miss the train and need to pay a much higher price to catch up... You can always find example that fits your bias. One way is to take the Nasdaq and say that the run up to 2000 was a bubble (and I tend to agree that it will not recover to new highs in the next 4-7 years) Another way is to take the SMI (swiss stock index, and you can find many other examples). This index made strong new highs after what was no "bubble", just a big correction. I think BTC is more like the SMI and even stronger longterm. Agree 100% with you. This is a big opportunity for bitcoins. If fits very well. At least well enough that it has a strong likelihood to catch a big wave. This is perfect. Thanks  The strength and speed of the next rally will show us whether we will be in a strong 3rd wave up or a fifth, terminal wave.If it will be a THIRD (edit, was a typo before) wave, you will likely see a new high reached even faster than the move from 1$ to 32$.If it is a fifth wave, it can be very slow, taking up to 6-12 months.Near term, it seems that some news flow and the OWS movement leads to many new bitcoin users / investors. I see that on my twitter followers which jumped to records in the past few days, much more growth than the past months before.This is not fully reflected in the Bitcoin price as it will take some time for new people to get funds into the exchanges.  someone connected to the OWS could add bitcoins as donation vehicle here: http://nycga.cc/donate/ No I do not follow him (yet). Let me find out more about him. Thanks for the suggestion. I know Robert Prechter well (not personally, but read all his books which helped me to predict the stock market declines and commodity declines over the past 5 years)
smile. there are 5 points, though :-) Thanks for your feedback. Sometimes the way the line is drawn has minor variations, which I try to avoid. At the same time, the BIG PICTURE is what counts: I have done a new chart here that uses a thicker trendline and this is quite clear. When doing this sort of analysis, the big trends are broad, and hence, too detailed views may lead to false signals.http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/index.htmlhttp://chart.ly/dc4tqrwThe line is not broken in the grand scheme of things. The more often a market touches, and briefly even breaks them before jumping back above, the stronger they will become. For long term bulls, here an update: http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/index.html We are at a very important juncture on BTCUSD.Here is an excerpt of the special update in the subscriber section: Prices are right where the longterm uptrend lines run. The view on the longterm chart, shows that we are likely at a buying opportunity of a "bitcoin lifetime". Very likely (80%), this trendline will at least spark a strong countertrend rally from approximately current levels. But as this trendline is important and prices are more in a consolidation than in a "bubble" state, there is a high probability that BTCUSD starts a rally to new all time highs. When looking at the very short term, we have been analysing two extreme scenarios: Either prices rally from here around 4 $. Or, BTCUSD will do one final dip below 3.79 $ before the reversal starts.Only a strong, sustained move below the long term trendline will result into a much deeper correction. Still, we do not see this as the more likely option and remain long term bullish.http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/index.html Just sent two alternate wave counts. Let me know if you have not received it. Agree. BTCUSD sits on the major long term uptrend line which should spark a strong rally. I echo that  It is not the bots driving bitcoin prices down, but the fact that overall more people are selling than buying.Bots have no chance to drive prices down if enough people start buying bitcoin with significant volume and less volume is up for sale. It is interesting how important Fibonacchi numbers are.The current results are at the exact perfect Fib percentages of 38% and 62%...And yes, sentiment is too bearisg to allow for much more downside, at least mid term No, the long term trend is not going down, but the market is dynamic and so it the bitcoin charts analysis, where we look into the charts on daily basis.The more price data we have the more accurate can we run bitcoin price forecasts  As promised a while ago, we have just published the first bitcoin charts and bitcoin sentiment study publicly. With this, we introduce the Bitcoin Bull Bear Index http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/index.html.Thanks to all voters to make this interesting analysis possible.And, for the next week, the poll is reset.What is your view?Up?Down?Same as now?Don't know? long term, we are still in a bull market. major support has not been breached Mining is not leading, but trailing bitcoin prices I agree. These times are great to wipe out the weak hands. hearing all this, the customer service should definitely be improved fast at MtGox In principle yes, and it will even make an all time high as long as the long term trend remains up.When it happens and how long it takes, this is where the uncertainty lies, not about the if.But, if prices break below the long term uptrend line, then bitcoin has a big issue. Correct, it is a reflection of overall market balance, which will change big time soon (in a matter of hours, days, or maximum of 3 weeks) See historic comparison..."Stable" prices happen all the time in financial markets, and it also happened for bitcoins already many times. See here for an example:https://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst See historic comparison...Stable prices have nothing to do with manipulation. It happens all the time in financial markets, and it also happened for bitcoins already many times. See here for an example:https://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst
Could we also consider kitchen/dish analysis?There is the cup&handle pattern! Depends on the region.. In the Mt. Everest region, you'll need a few... I agree with you Nagle.We are seeing just normal market behaviour.If someone complains about low bitcoin prices, he/she should either buy more coins or attract others to buy coins. ups.. mea culpa! Sounds very good to me.When and where do you plan to publish it? wow! so what it the truth now? is Clear Satoshi or not? I agree with you here.It needs cash injection by existing bitcoin users and/or getting new people into it. Someone is trying to hold and talk the market down. Lets see if he / she is successful ... But I prefer the elliottwave count.  There are two alternate ways to draw the triangle.Both are valid options. The Roman symbols are elliott wave count labels. see elliottwave.com   Brief update. It looks as if we are in a triangle with likely break out to the upside. What are you basing your forecast on? do you have any evidence on that? cycles come and go. there will be a time when tuesdays and sundays will be very different A bot can not force prices up or down at all.Only large players can do that, and obviuosly they can use bots or trade manually.In the end, the market goes where it wants, and bots can not change the direction. Typischweise ist der Kursverlauf der "leading indicator", nicht umgekehrt, d.h. der Preis steigt BEVOR News rauskommen, da einige immer einen Informationsvorsprung haben. Look for example on the USD index botton forming recently. It was a long process of ups and downs until finally it shot up.
It is normal in a bottom forming process to give many false signals and kick out the weak hands, like you where is the recovery in the nasdaq? we have just seen a dead cat bounce before we see low triple digits in the next years.But there is no correlation with bitcoin which is still in an uptrend. The nasdaq, however, is not in an uptrend any more.http://imghaven.com/images/23856/ndx20110930.png You are so right. Unfortunately there are so many "coach = bitcoin forum potatoes", sitting in front of the PC and complaining about everything. What they (and all of us) should rather do it actively participating to bring the bitcoin economy forward.  Agree. I know what you are trying to say. But rally does not mean that the upside is bigger than market reversal.You can have a rally in a 1min chart and it only moves 0.2% and still can be called rally. Correct.And the strength of an analyst come through to see that the market is doing something differently and then adapt the forecast as we did thereafter on Aug 26:"The short term rally that started at 5.74 $ came to an end yesterday with a decline below 10.5 $ and 10 $. This is a bearish sign and shows that bitcoin prices have entered a more protracted correction again . Further downside is now more likely. It will take a move above 14 $ to confirm the mid term rally continuation. A test or even break of the key level of 5.74 $ is now quite probable."And exactly this happened. Do you have any data how many Chinese are already buying or using bitcoins? Is there any measure available for awareness of bitcoins in China? it does not matter if you call it reversal or rally. Both just say that prices are rising I agree with you 100%. I do not see the doom scenario. BTCUSD has not even seriously tested the long term trend. As long as the trend is not broken, the 1.5 year rally remains the active scenario. I agree and disagree with you at the same time. A break of the longterm trend could lead to a total "crash" of bitcoin interest and wipe it out from the landscape (apart from a few thousand of hardcore bitcoin-lovers.Even if I do not like it - in the current world-, price development plays a dominant role, and if we enter a vicious cycle with bitcoins, it may never come up again.  Can you specify what you mean with "August prediction"I issued 4 analysis over August, 3 of them bearish, indicating a drop into the 4-5 $ area.http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/2011/08/bitcoin-technical-and-bitcoin-market-analysis-august-26th-2011-by-s3052/http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/2011/08/bitcoin-technical-analysis-august-14th-2011-by-s3052/http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/2011/08/bitcoin-technical-analysis-a-review-august-7th-2011-by-s3052/http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/2011/08/bitcoin-technical-analysis-august-3rd-2011-by-s3052/[color] You are right, it is the combination of numerous chart tools and indicators. (Un)fortunately it is not automated and works with only one tool. And even worse, the market follows certain "tools" for a couple of months or even years and then not any more. The key is to accept when this is the case and not automatically follow things. Thanks for your feedback. Feedback is always a gift.See attached the two most extreme trendlines1) based on closing prices (pink)2) based on intraday prices (red)Both have not been broken clearly. This is a good point. There are always slight variations on how to draw the lines, but the key point is that however you draw it, there has not been a substantial violation of the major uptrend.Because if the major trend is broken, you see a rapid, crash-type decline with increasing volume. we clearly have not seen that and this is why the longterm uptrend has held. agree with you. we are at key support levelsBitcoin Technical Analysis: Public Update released: http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Public Update released: http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com The charts and trendlines work equally well for bitcoins as for other financial markets. No issue with the trading volume. this looks very interesting You are right, the only leading indicator for the overall bitcoin project are bitcoin prices , i.e. BTCUSD Don't assume weekly or monthly calendar patterns persist. Very often you find 2-3 times fulfilling your prophecy and then they do not work any more.I still remember the talks about the dead-sure weekend drop and then it did not happen at all any more.
ia there any news on this topic? Es sieht wirklich so aus als kommen solide kaufvolumina in den markt. Das führt zu einer stabilisierung mit aufwärtspotential. Thank you. I always try to do my best.by the way, I have reset the poll again. As promised, a sentiment analysis will be done this weekend and shared publicly.What is your view?Up?Down?Same as now?Don't know? Quite times are always followed by volatile times. We will soon see some stronger action in the next days thanks for the clarification You are so right.The good thing is that these Elliott Wave pattern repeat themselves over and over again, in big and small time frames. If Mark Kapeles said that publicly, then I believe him Silver is an even bigger trap (I gave an alert this morning and now we see what happened...http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com/stocks-metals-etc.htmlA big party for the bears... which is far from over.We can get prepared to collect silver and gold coins below 10$ and 1000$ respectively. I agree. The technical picture has turned to the bullish side.more in tonights weekly technical bitcoin report If MtGox is trading on its own exchange this is insider trading and should be stopped.we should clarify this with the owner Mark kapeles.  Great charts.Keep up the fantadtic work seeing the train leaving the station without you yes, this would be fantastic The fact that so many people "would like" to see lower prices before is a good sentiment indicator that new lows get less and less likely. Overall, Bitcoin prices are at a very interesting juncture and people may memorize the "Bitcoin September 2011" in history.As expected in the last technical analysis, bitcoin prices did not hold the 5.74 $ level. Bitcoin prices fell another -30% to 4.18 $.Looking ahead, the stabilization around the 4 $ range in recent days, plus the bullish divergences of key indicators point to a strong possibility of a rally.   chart: see http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com Technical AnalysisWe focus today on the big picture, the long term view.There is a lot of chatter about the "BITCOIN BUBBLE", but in reality there is no bubble in bitcoins. Definitely not yet. Why is the decline from June no bubble? 1) The bitcoin price decline as evident in the attached logarithmic bitcoin chart looks like a standard correction: The 1 year rally has been much steeper than the 3 months correction. The logarithmic chart is the right way to visualize prices because prices rose exponentially in a very short period of time.2) The volumes in turnover (not shown here) of the rally is much stronger than the volume of the past 3 months correction. 3) Pessimism has been and still is very strong, as evidenced by bitcoin investor sentiment poll data and the "doom & gloom" comments in the bitcoin forum. We have been using this sentiment very successfully as contrary indicator: When too many people are bearish, they are not invested and hope for lower prices. As prices may never get lower, they need to chase the rally in some point and the rally gains momentum.4) Key indicators such as RSI and MACD show bullish divergences (see bitcoin chart)5) Bitcoin prices have respected the key long term red uptrend line and tested successfully. This uptrend line is very strong support. And even another decline into the 3-4 $ area is still a possibility which would not invalidate the longterm uptrend as we can draw the uptrend line also a bit different (see orange line).6) Bitcoin prices are on the verge of a breakout above the green downtrend line, which could initiate a strong rally. Only a high volume, sustained break below 3 $ will make us turn long term bearish bitcoins. Otherwise, there is upside potential to new all time highs, into the 50 - 100 $ area. At the same time, one has to be patient, as the rise to those levels will not be a "straight line".As always, we update the short term picture closely in the subscriber section of http://www.bitcoinbullbear.com   This is great! Wonderful.Just one question: Is there an issue with the connection at the moment. In my case, it disconnects within a split second after hitting the connect button. The bitcoin sentiment went up and down with prices, in a similar way as other financial vehicles behave (stocks, commodities, etc.)There is nothing unusual with bitcoin people. They were no more optimists as people were optimistic about stocks in 2007 and 2011. And they are also very pessimistic since August.More to come about sentiment soon. yes, I will publish these in the next 2 weeks. The poll is reset again. What is your view?Up?Down?Same as now?Don't know?
interesting idea: a redbull market. I have one in the fridge and will open it now as I write this :-) It does not matter if bitcoin is compared to stocks or forex or commodities. fact is that the bitcoin prices and bitcoin charts behave just like those. Charting analysis works perfectly well for bitcoins, no matter what they are supposed to be.And, like many have written in this section, it really depends if the log charts or the normal charts dominate. Our view is that the log charts are more appropriate and on log charts, bitcoins is no cat, no dead cat, but a big bull who is taking his afternoon nap before steaming forward again. Your guess is wrong. The chart is from mid February 2011 when prices traded at the high at 1.1 $    Some people fare well not using charts, and some fare well using charts. Both options are very valid.We have been using charts successfully for bitcoin since September 2010, just like any other financial market (for more than a decade). +1Well said and so true. our technical analysis has also predicted that btcusd even broke 5$.After the low at just above 4$, we may now see base building before potentially rally again. No. I am just leading the technical analysis blog on bitcoinwatch.All other things on bitcoinwatch are led by the bitcoinwatch owner. I have been criticizing MtGox quite a couple of times, but I disagree with chodpaba.MtGox IS the leading exchange. As they account for more than 80% of the BTC volume, they are by default the ones suffering from almost all attacks.Despite that, they have been moving into the right direction in the last weeks. It is still not perfect yet, but unless someone comes up with a competitive alternative, there are the best, and they will get better every day.They are also taking up the huge challenge to fight for getting bank access in France, which noone dared before.This small data mess from yesterday will not change anything when it comes to overall BTCUSD forecasts.(That said, I have asked separately to get yesterday's data straight, just to make sure we don't leave this stone "un-turned").  I think it would be great if MtGox and/or bitcoinwatch could clear up this fog. Did those trades actualy happen or not.If not, then can you please clean up the data?thank you based on the sentiment polls, only 40% of forum members see the bitcoin price down.beginning of august it was more than 60%.the current sentiment is not bearish enough to believe in a sustainable low at currentvalues. I am just trying to offer technical analysis to help people making informed bitcoin trading decisions .typically , this forum is biased with UP UP UP talks (see Bruce ...)and it is important to also show some balanced views.some people could protect their savings if they sold before.Personally, I do not have any interest in falling bitcoin prices, I would prefer rising bitcoin prices. But it is important to leave emotions aside when investing / trading. a break below 5.74$ will very likely open the floodgates for a crash-type selloff EDIT: To "aq":You are right with your models, I would reframe it: Maximize global purchasing power would be the goal.In any case, we will wait for a legal decision on bitcoin before taking any further action beyond the technical analysis. The new chart looks great, but I still think that your model is too rigid and will does not account for the emotional, herding forces that are behind the market. Chart patterns and ElliottWaves do a better job, in my humble p.o.v. Your model might work in 80% of the time when there is almost no movement in prices, but then it is completely wrong when prices move in either direction, smashing through your support / resistance levels, and then make people fall out of the bed when they see that :-) Thanks for the flowers :-)But we would only look into this once we would be registered as an official hedge fund, and we would provide full disclosure and transparency.   Thanks for digging it up again, for me this was a champagne high tea :-) but the USDCHF party is not yet over.Parity is possible in the next weeks and months. thanks a ton!and here is the link for other to dowsnload all historical data for MtGox (since start of trading)http://bitcoincharts.com/t/trades.csv?symbol=mtgoxUSD&start=1282038389 It would be great if someone could help me with this data, ideally starting from August 2010 to date on MtGox.I searched, but could not find a clear mention on how to do that.thanks bitcoiners in anticipation Also from my side a big thanks!You shed light onto the current situation and I also agree to your outlook. this is no panic selling (yet), but there is a likelihood that we will see the panic soon
I am not sure if I have missed it, so here the question:Do you expect a ruling on Sep 13 or will this only be the start of the lawsuit? Forget about the order book for anything longer term than minutes... and even that does not tell you a lot.Experienced traders and those using bots know excatly that there are some less experienced out there who get caught in the belief that they know the direction when just looking at the order book.There is no such thing as a free lunch. And only using the order book would almost be free... Wait just a little bit and you will see my prediction to come true This is why we are using some more flexible charting tools to predict BTCUSD. Rather than predicting each days range, we predict overall trends and price targets. Short position closed successfully with a gain of 117.19 points with good leverage. I will either take a new position tomorrow just under 1912 or wait until we may see another pop into the 2000-2100 area.Here is the copy paste from my official trading account:23/08/11   Gold Kassa   -   SELL   0.1   1884.49   1767.3And, accepted the bet as well. Deal catching a falling knife can be dangerous in stocks and also in bitcoins Would anyone care to reply? thanks in advance This is interesting and could have a major impact on the future of bitcoins and of course also on bitcoin prices.Two questions:1) What is the issue to become an official bank for MtGox? (apart from the costs, which could be covered also by investors) Forget about anonymity for the moment as well.2) If MtGox dows not (want to) become a bank, we could engage with one existing bank or broker (i.e. CMCmarkets, igmarkets, swissquote, etc) to allow bitcoin trading. If this would be accepted, how difficult would it be to integrate bitcoin into their trading software and systems? The poll is reset again. What is your view?Up?Down?Same?Don't know? Technicals point down and there is quite some probability to see a crash-type decline before a more meaningful bottom can be put in place.This crash can go down and slice below 7$, 5$ and even 2$, without endangering the longterm bitcoin trend. What you are projecting is a possibility, but remains our alternate forecast as long as we do not see a strong breakout above 12 $.As long as this remains, we continue to expect lower prices. Often the markets do not need a reason for falling, they just fall upon its onw weight. http://www.bitcoinbullbear.comlatest short term analysis +1Agree with you. Most often those longer term downtrends like the down we have seen since June 2011 end with a capitulation "crash".We probably need to see this in BTCUSD before we make significant progress on the upside. correct. Forget about bitcoin trading volumes less than a couple of thousand btc per day. It is completely irrelevant. thanks. I did not come across this one yet. This is not directly related to bitcoin trading and bitcoin chart analysis, but can have a big impact on bitcoin prices:check this out.http://bit.ly/nXcRYg indeed, trend is down  +1. Well written and so true.By the way, to the point that we need more positive media coverage: We are starting a PR campaign soon (see thread from piper). I agree with chodpaba.Transparency in the order book is not the issue.It is the overall professionalism and proactivity of the big exchanges that is not (yet) keeping up with the development.
I am really hoping the exchanges will be more proactive managing all those issues and come up with the right steps to bring more confidence of investors and traders, technical people, everyone soon. I have viewed quite  a few fake walls, which really disappered quickly (perhaps got partially filled). So it is definitely happening. At the same time, there are also many real walls.Net, there is both happening. Like many people said, we should not look too much into the orderbook. Experienced traders, and particularly those who can use bots, will use this to fool others with this strategy.I used the order book well from October 2010 to March / April 2011, but after it got too inconsistent due to the above mentioned phenomenon. thanks.I wish mtgox would deliver better data Hi again, there is still some discrepancy between your order book completeness vs. MtGox (see here: https://mtgox.com/trade/history)If you click on Market depth rounded, you see that the bids and ask go further than on your site. Any idea why? I remember it was better on your site days before. Anything changed?  You can read "market wizards". There is no need to reinvent the wheel. This is my last post here in this thread about the topic of "can a trader beat the market regularly, without being lucky all the time", as I do not want to take more time to debate this with people not even trying to understand.Trading, using technical analysis, and the proper money management is a skill that you can learn. But it is hard work. You can compare it with learning to play a music instrument or playing tennis.If a musician or tennis player practiced for years, he will likely be better than others who are less talented and / or trained less hard.It is no chance or luck that they beat others on a regular basis, the may lose some matches, but will win the majority of matches.The same applies for trading and other activities. Yes, and we also gave a sell signal after prices did not hold above 10.5$, which was a critical requirement.  We are down from the high 8 weeks to the 5.74 $ low, and down 11 weeks to date.  block 43+44 please. Send me a pm and I respond.thank you Weighing the pros and cons, pataya should not be the location.bitcoin rather needs more serious PR and needs go build credibility. Yes, the charts work for very well for this. If you are interested, I can share some examples, but don't have time today. It is no chance if someone has consistently a track record of over 70% success.This is based on statistics. And no: I don't think that for just being 70% right I deserve a Nobel price. Now you made my day. I can't stop laughing.  Thanks for summarizing so well. +1 There are good fundamental analyst, i.e. Warren Buffet at least was picking some good stocks. And there are a number of good technical analysts who can strong track records.It's like sports, there are good and bad left handed tennis players, there are good and bad right handed tennis players, and both can be world class.It is commonly accepted that technical analysis works. But I don't want to persuade you, it is perfectly fine that you do not want to use it.  I need to think more globally... I mean: In May 2010, bitcoin trading started at bitcoinmarket and in August 2010 on MtGox Thanks for the valid question, so let me clarify:Long term is looking at monthly charts. Starting period summer 2010. TREND UPMid term is looking at weekly / daily charts. TREND DOWNShort term are all time frames under 60min charts. TREND DOWN. Thanks for the clear and prompt answer, and.. keep your great service up! Great that you started this thread. Let's work together. I will sent back some feedback and ideas soon.
I could agree with you if I have done 5 trades, but I have a 70% success rate since 8 years, with more than 5,000 trades. I can only speak for me: In financial markets, more than 70% of my trades are profitable, and the profitable ones are bigger than the losing ones. I do this with 100% technical analysis, I don't read / watch finnacial news, nothing, only look at charts. And this works for bitcoins brilliantly as well.But you are right, not everyone is skilled to do it and more importantly, has the proper money management discipline. This is where most people fail, whatever method they use, be it fundamental or technical. Unfortunately, there is no simple, reuccring "rhyme" in the bitcoin market nor in most other financial markets, otherwise it would be too easy...Fortunately, technical chart analysis of bitcoin prices can really help a lot to guide you.Have a look at http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/ or subscribe for newest and deeper bitcoin price forecast to guide bitcoin trading.Currently, there is no reason for me to buy. We need to see either a high volume rally that breaks through at least the 12 $ area, or more likely there will be a steeper drop before attempting to bottom out It is fixed now, thanks Blitzboom Clark,your site is just great.One question on the depth of the order book on MtGox. Can you display the full order book or is it truncated?If it is truncated, it should have no orders above and below a certain level.The reason why I am asking is that there are only very small bids below 6 $ and only small asks above 12 $. What is the truth? Your assessment is correct. Based on form of the pattern and volume, we will likely see the next wave of selling.Only a strong , big volume move above 12 or 14 $ would change that. Very likely, even 10.5 $ is a big resistance level. It happened today, see chart example I agree that there are competitors who might be better.But noone dares to do proper marketing and advertising.You cant expect to overtake the marketleader with a "garage shop" operation.and thanks for the advice with refreshing. I am trying now. As mentioned before, one big issue with bitcoin is related to one of its greatest benefits: The decentralization. This fosters individuals randomly developing (often great businesses around bitcoin). But noone coordinates PR, marketing , advertising, which means a lot of waste and contradictory messages.Companies -at least many of them- do consistent brand building, which bitcoins are lacking massively.If this does not start quickly, the "outside world" will be successful keeping bitcoins down. I.e. bitcoins is acompetition to government currencies, to big credit cards companies, etc.Coordinated efforts are needed from all of us bitcoiners, rather than complaining and debating about minor issues in this forum foreever. The bitcoin price charts are screwed because of this fake dip...MtGox, please test changes online first, before going live. Thank you.And please, remove this trade from the history. Thank you a second time. Thanks, this does not help bringing back confidence for investors and traders. Just imagine those things happened weekly on major stock exchanges...We need better, more secure, more professional exchanges, quickly, before people turn away from bitcoins and prices are back to pennies. Yes, there is no reason to buy bitcoins beyond day-trading activities, when considering reward / risk ratios.Even a rise to 10$ or 12$ would not yet eliminate the downward risk to the 5 $ area. And if 5$ does not hold there is a risk for a much bigger crash, as we also outlined in the subscription section.by the way, what happened just minutes ago? There is a brief spike to 6 $ on the charts? Is there yet again another issue / hack on Mtgox??? I hope not. Bitcoin Forecast:Long term: UP.Mid term: DOWN.Short term: DOWN.Color legend: Green: UP, Purple: SIDEWAYS, Red: DOWN. The short term rally that started at 5.74 $ came to an end yesterday with a decline below 10.5 $ and 10 $. This is a bearish sign and shows that bitcoin prices have entered a more protracted correction again . Further downside is now more likely. It will take a move above 14 $ to confirm the mid term rally continuation.A test or even break of the key level of 5.74 $ is now quite probable. Bitcoin Technical and Bitcoin Market AnalysisThe strong decline from yesterday has changed the outlook significantly. 1) Bitcoin Prices broke beneath the key 10 $ and 10.5 $ level.2) The bitcoin market is now below the green upper resistance line.3) The momentum indicator MACD is likely to confirm a sell signal with a bearish cross over.4) The relative strength is waning and is now again below 50, which is also bearish.  Trade Bitcoins well!

S3052 owns some bitcoins.  Never invest unless you can afford to lose your entire investment. Not really cheap china stuff..See in the picture: Armani fragrances, and many more great brands. cypherdoc: Agree on deflation. Big time.It just seems that there are some hardcore inflationists with linear thinking that we can only convince them once S&P is below 600 and Silver bewlo 10 $. But I am happy to wait for this to happen until posting in this thread again :-) Bruce, I don't want to imagine where bitcoin would be without you.Well done and keep going. Don't get demotivated by people criticizing you. They should rather help you or dooing sth good for bitcoin themselves.I will come to the Amsterdam conference for sure. fixed.... sorryyyyyyy Nothing against you personally. Instead, I really like your depth of fundamental analysis. At the same time, it feels that you are too emotional, clearly showing that you HOPE that prices stay up because you are fully invested in Gold. I wish you are right. But at least see the risk for a much more significant decline.And if you are in the same way bullish Silver as you are with Gold, then I would be very very careful, because I expext the bigegst silver decline in this century.  It does not have its own thread, but based on what I have seen with my own eyes, it should be. I think I have seen alone 20,000 items in the electronics and computer category. I just opened a thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=39085.0 "coiner" EDIT: "COINED" asked me whether bitcoindeals is really something big.I can only speak for myself. It is BIG. I have seen alone 20,000 items in the computer and electronics area to buy with bitcoins.The founders just want to make sure to have all ducks in the row before opening it to real big traffic, but it is very professional - and to me, a breakthrough in trading goods for bitcoins.www.bitcoindeals.comhttps://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinDeals
Rather than complaining you could better try to attract new people into bitcoin, etc. Correct. I predict it will fall to below 10$. If you buy at 30$ you will catch the falling knife. Yes. Buying silver is a great idea, when it has fallen below 10$ in the next 1-3 years. Overall, this is a step in the right direction to address the need to have fast access to bitcoins.To Tradehill and other exchanges: Apart from offering your "exchange  product", what are you doing to market bitcoins to the people out there? Are you "just" waiting for others to do PR, advertising, hoping to profit from that?What are your bitcoin advertising / marketing plans? ok. I fully understand. no worries thanks, buddy :-)Lets go fishing together soon. EDIT: with golden rods and reels and hooks :-) You are right, it depends on the definition.. It's launched on beta, invites only to test it properly and make sure it is robust. I love this boat. This is so beautiful. Already +70 points on XAUUSD... with big leverage. Based on what I have seen when screening through the offers, and also in the example of the bitcoin show, I'd say that it is very competitively priced.Look yourself at  http://onlyonetv.com/2011/08/the-bitcoin-show-episode-037/and/or if you can get an invite. I like your time scaling.Indeed, price pattern tend to repeat themselves very often, and the only thing to adjust is time.This is also one element in Elliott Wave analysis, and some of that we use in addition to out bitcoin price forecast in the Technical Analysis reports very successfully. It is live. Follow them on twitter and you can may get an invitation code It is the opposite. Miners are leading indicators. The fact that I short PMs is also supported by the underperformance of mining stocks. The site it just great. You can buy almost anything with bitcoins. This is breakthrough. This is in line with my forecast and trading..As indicated in my last posts, I shorted. I got it between 1890-1910. Lets see how many hundred points we see Gold going lower.  So, put your money where your mouth is. What about betting 10 BTC or 50 BTC. I am sure you have at least 10 BTC, or 50 BTC. The news are all prices in already. Technical analysis always works. I know this is a bold statement but if you use technical analysis properly, you CAN succeed.But to succeed you need to have 100% discipline to cut losses short and secondly, you need to have great money management skills.All 3 together will make a great trader.In terms of recent price action, we continue to see consolidation after the almost 50% rise from 8.4 $ to almost 12 $. This is absolutely normal.The 10.5 $ - 10 $ area should offer formidable support for a further rise. Below 10 $ and we enter a neutral stance. Below 8.4 $ will likely lead to a test of the broad 5 $ zone.If 10.5 $ -10 $ holds, the rally can continue and above 12 $ will likely lead to 16-17 $. Deal. I bet with you 1 BTC. Be careful what you are speculating, without doing the proper due diligence. I am not publishing different recommendations in the paid newsletter vs. public updates.  Without this being a real press coverage, the launch of bitcoindeals.com is in my p.o.v groundbreaking, and this was announced at the bitcoin conference.People have asked for a long time, about when can we buy real stuff with bitcoins, and here it is. Just have a look. The fundamentals of the technical chart patterns are strong, this is what I mean. (sorry for the potential confusion)
This week is another turn window for Gold (the last window did produce a decline, but only temporary). So I will go short again around 1880-1920$. Stop loss for me is above 1950 $, but I don't think it will reach it. There does not need to be new media coverage to push prices up.The underlying market fundamentals are strong. You are so right..Bitcoin remains in rally mode, and this has nothing to do with the bitcoin conference.The technical fundamentals are strong and point to a further rally of bitcoin price Agree with your theory that exactly this will happen. But before, a significant precious metal correction and dollar rally is due. Watch USDCHF as leading currency indicator. It is up 10% from the low 10d ago. As long as USDCHF is above this 0.7062 $  low, a big rally of the USD is likely. Thorium. Interesting. Where and how do you buy Thorium?  The only 3 metals I am bullish is 1) physical Gold which one should own for sure now (i.e. 20%), and buy more i.e when the big correction comes (Gold is probably topping in the next 2 weeks)2) Uranium (but this is in my p.o.v unethical as it is related to wars, so I dont do it) EDIT: Also Uranium may have further room to the downside until it gets really nasty in the global economy3) Bitcoins :-) when it is on a metal USB stick :-)  It's because of two effects:1) The global economy is tanking and will crash really hard, into the biggest crash in the past 250 years, which means this will be bigger than 1929. Silver specifically will crash real hard because i) it is used as industrial metal much more than gold, and once industrials turn down even harder, demand for silver will collapse. ii) silver prices have also been largely driven up by speculators , and many of them will run to the exit once the economy gets worse.2) The charts are supporting the Silver decline. The last 2 months of advance is choppy and is best interpreted by a upward correction, which will be followed by a large decline below 30 $ in a swift move. Secondly, Silver is underperforming Gold, which is a leading indicator for most of the financial markets. The Silver / Gold ratio is down hard since spring 2011.When would I be wrong?Only if Silver makes a new high above 50$. But even if this happens, the crash is just postponed and Silver prices will eventually come back below 10 $ in the next 2-5 years. Don't worry, it will turn down hard soon Let's wait until we hear some announcements from the conference. I am also curious, but we should be able a day or two.. Here is a short term update. Trend is up after the break above bull flag trend channel.https://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst This is perfectly fine. Let's continue to watch it.  bravooo, magnifique!!! The actual trading performance is for me more important as historical models. Since start of trading, performance of this alpha fund is down in the absolute and even underperforming the benchmark. We shared buy signals i) above 10 $, ii)  above 20 $ in May/June, which were very helpful. The last buy scenario between 13-14 $ was not yielding bug progress, and was followed with a stop loss reco below 12.5-12.8$.We then gave a buy zone between 5-5.8 $ and prices fell below 12.5-12.8 $ and hit 5.74$ at the low.We gave sell signals at i) 31.6 $, ii) below 20$ and iii) the last one was below 12.5-12.8$. Those signals were quite useful.  This is a good way to look at it. I have charted this H&S pattern last week in my bitcoin technical analysis report in the subscriber section, and then subsequently given a BUY rating at 8.4 $.  Long term: UP.Mid term: Consolidation from the 31.9 $ all time high.Short term: UP from the 5.74 $ low.Color legend: Green: UP, Purple: SIDEWAYS, Red: DOWN. With the expected fall into the 5 - 5.8 $ area, the minimum downside retracement has been reached last week. This could have already been the end of the correction from the all time high of 31.9 $. If this is true, bitcoins could be starting a major rally again which would be important for bitcoin trading. Bitcoin Technical AnalysisWe may be right at the start of a major rally, provided bitcoin will confirm the nascent breakout above the trend channel - as shown on below chart.The short term will remain UP as long as the 5 - 5.8 $ zone holds (red line), and even better, as long as 8.4 $ holds.Momentum (MACD) and relative strength indicators point upwards for the first time since mid June 2011.http://bit.ly/pf9p9f Trade Bitcoins well! Stay tuned for further Bitcoin technical analysis here.Your S3052 Nothing against your efforts, but I really do not think you can use this model to predict financial markets. Financial markets including bitcoins work irrationally and based upon mass psychology. This analysis is very complex and require the use of other instruments, like technical analysis, indicators, sentiment, wave patterns, etc. on top of mathematical models.One example are the small ranges you give every day. This works for a while, but then there is a huge breakout which you did not predict. For example in the technical analysis  we saw that a break below 12.5-12.9 will quickly lead to 10$ then 5-5.82 $ and then a subsequent rise to at least 10$, which happened almost exactly.But you did not predict those up to 100% moves. There is a very good chance for a rally based on the technical chart pattern. And the decline from the 31.9$ high does not look like a bubble, but rather as a normal correction in a healthy uptrend I am getting jealous if your are going to rave. At least please share a video / pics with me. You are so funny. Gold down -3.7% today.I am already +40% in the profits with the leveraged short position I took today.
You are generalizing without showing any evidence or data. I am chartist and have foreseen the recent stock market top (i.e. shorted the DAX at 7300 points and sold the shorts at 5518), solely based on charts, and I know more chartists who have foreseen that than fundamentalists.As said in the other thread, I am happy to wager. And, the broad range is just a simplification for this thread. I  have clear short, mid and longterm price targets that I do not reveal now. I take the challenge: 1 BTC bet My personal short/mid term targets are 1300-1400, then 1000. Then we will see whether we also reach 600-800.  Me too.Very very short on gold around 1795 today. Can be a big winner on the way down @brocktice:I tried to answer this question here:http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/2011/08/bitcoin-technical-analysis-a-review-august-7th-2011-by-s3052/#comment-253 My facts are chart pattern that show that Gold is in a major long term uptrend.But as in all trends, there are corrections. before Gold will skyrocket, we will see a correction from current or 2000 $ into the broad 600-1400 area.Further supporting facts is the contrarian indicator sentiment. We see >95% bullish sentiment on gold which indicates that too many are already invested and the short term trend will change soon, as it happened so many times before here is the link to view the charts: http://bit.ly/q3UQ9WLongterm: UP.Midterm: UP as long as the 9.5 $ - 10 $ range holdsShortterm: UP from the 12.5 $ low and down sloping channel resistance.[/quote]This was not correct.  Just sayin'.[/quote]Yeah, bitcoin is not stable enough to be properly analyzed.Anyone hitting it with math to find the future in the long term will propably fail at doing so consistently.You see, individuals can have a far to great influence on the price.There isnt a stable portion of the traders behaving as a mass and so any assumptions made about masses behaving will fail.And since the price is decided, ultimately, by behaviour it is kindof strange to see people trying to abstract the hell out of bitcoin while they're dealing with more individualism and less group behaviour than their math has been tuned to.[/quote]I know you may not have had the time to review the success of the technical analysis since I started here in October 2010.In fact, I started the Technical Analysis on bitcoins exactly with the purpose to answer the question: "Will my technical analysis work for bitcoin as well as for other financial markets?".And indeed, it works just as fine.And when looking at one of the latest technical analysis: "up from the 12.5 low". This means that the preferred scenario is UP, but it also says that you should sell when it breaks below. Many bitcoin traders have done that, minimized potential losses and bought back in the 5.74 - 7.8 $ area (many of my subscribers gave me this positive feedback). And lastly, to become a good trader on bitcoins or other financial markets, there is more than technical anaylsis you need to master: money management. Everybody needs to learn this. We can't manage this as we do not know your risk profile, etc. I am indeed short CHF since today (larger position) and Gold/USD (small initial position) on top Agree with the addition that Silver will be going down even harder and further than Gold (in my humble p.o.v) 1300-1400 within the next 6 months, 1000 within the next 1.5 years. @cypherdoc:You are soooo right.Gold will surprise almost everyone when it goes down hard against the USD. We have have seen already the top today (went short at 1766 $ today) . But even if not, it will start from a bit higher levels and still has huge downside. Based on my chart analysis, 1300-1400 is the first target, but will fall soon to lead then to 1000-1100. And then we will see. If this does not hold, 600-800 are next. You do not need to convince me. In fact, you can't.We are in a massive deflation. Everything loses value against gold = gold is the only one holding value while all other prices (currencies as you shows very well, goods, other commodities lose in value).And soon, possible even with the today's high, gold will also decline. Stefan, ..... great idea as always, and unfortunately I won't be there.Do you know that there is the street parade on Sat 13th? You should ...maybe a good way to create PR and awareness for bitcoin? A bitcoin techno car? Naked people tattooed with bitcoins? ,... Gold is not in a bubble like Silver was up to its April high.However, Gold will still experience a major correction down into the 1000-1400 are, and possibly into the 680-800 zone. we outlined in our subscriber newsletters that "a break below the meak or break trendline (running between 12.3-12.5 ee expect a drop to 5 - 5.8. 5.74 was the low then. Just updated the bitcoin watch part with a brief review:http://bit.ly/nsteB3And yes, I am thinking about refining our offers including rates. You will hear from us in the next 7-10 days. That means washing out weak traders hands.In more-easy-to-understand terms, this means: Bitcoin / USD can experience a wild spike down, and it is difficult to assess at what price level it turns. Could be 6$, 5$, 2$, 1$, or lower. The downturn was expected to happen, independently from hackers, etc.The chart was very clear to change trend DOWN after the break of the major trendline, which was running between 12.2-12.5. More downside is likely now, perhaps in a "wash-out" type of crash.The 8.7 low was expected to be only a minor temporary support. thank you I am saying the inflationists will be wrong. First we see continued massive deflation (just look at the DJI/Gold chart then you will realize that we have deflation, not inflation.
:-) correct.  lets see who is right. The 400 target makes sense to me. agree with you with a target extension: take away another 0.400 we come by 2014-2016 Let's see how it plays out. I shorted Majestic Silver (NYSE: AG) two days ago at 24$. Now down -12 %. Thanks for the encouraging words. You and others are always welcome to join the subscribers. I just issued the weekly report with a longterm outlook and 3 major options. Doesn't this look weird: "No withdrawals possible..." Maybe another scam? I We do not have to agree. I am short stocks since DJI 12,600, silver since 43$, EURUSD since 1.47 and those trades run well, and I will stay midterm in those positions (probably until 2014-2016); and additionally do some hedging and playing short term bounces.  Impact could be on individuals who are long stocks. If they get wiped out / lost a lot of money in the stock market, and have a lot of BTC, they may sell some BTC to get back some cash.But I doubt that so many BTC holders are also big Stock holders.  This is a good comparison, with the exception that this time the metal drop will be more severe. Probably down -80% to -90%, except for Gold, which may only drop -20 to -50% in dollar terms. Silver indeed often leads other markets like stocks, but you can't only look at short term correlations.Indeed, this year, Silver topped before the nasdaq. There is strong evidence that short selling actually smooths declines and not accelerate. Short selling provides liquidity and ultimately also buying power since short sellers MUST COVER and BUY BACK. Normal sellers do not have to.But financial journalists and politicians have no clue about the markets and are happy to find a scapegoat and this is short selling  Just for my understanding: Bitomat is still operating as we speak, correct? Big intraday turn down today. Looks like the start of the Silver desaster.  And here is an example on how I see Gold prices.http://chart.ly/hi5cdqh5 completed Elliott waves. Perhaps a couple of $ more upside, then big correction.Silver also completed 5 Waves up, but started its decline already in April 2011, again a leading indicator, and hence leading Gold as well. Great discussion. Sorry for not being more detailed in my answers, I am working on a few important things. But o.k. here is my explanation attempt.I am not really good at fundamentals, hence, my explanation might sound layman-ish. I am much better at charting but can't do an analysis now.The main reason why I am bearish Silver is:Silver prices have skyrocketed this year mainly behind speculation, which is not justified by the industrial value. This speculation is largely via leveraged tools, and in the current and more severe upcoming crash/crisis, people need to sell stuff to pay their bills, and this includes leveraged Silver derivatives. And Silver is not alone, as all assets will plummet in the midst of this historic crash.And even if the current price seem to be justifies because of industrial use, this will also change as the economy falters and Silver demand shrinks..Overall, midterm, over the next couple of years, this will drag Silver down.Longterm I am relatively bullish Silver. It will be the first indicator that the crash is over. It is wise to keep some physical Silver even if it goes doen in dollar terms. If Silver rises again strongly from low single digits, then a new bull market starts. But based on my longterm time studies, this will not be before 2014. Great comment. They more pushback I get the more convinced I get that I am on the right side. And this has guided me and subscribers very well through the bitcoin swings, but also myself throughout the last decade of financial markets, using only technical patterns. evreyone is his own boss, ... but beware catching a falling knife.. it hurts Fully disagree and we can at least agree to disagree :-)What you are saying is what 99.9% of people believe. Hence, it is too late now, and the opposite will happen. I will bet 5 BTC with you that Silver will drop below 30 $ by Jan 12 and another 5 BTC for a drop below 10 $ somewhere between 2012 and 2015.And by the way, you do not show the full (and most important) chart history: The previous Silver high of 50 $ in 1980. This means that Silver did not gain at all vs. this high, and when accounting for inflation, Silver today is down massively vs. 30 years ago.. It was correct at that time, and was the right sequence: On Saturday, the 30th we gave the public update. On Monday, August 1, we did the in depth analysis for subscribers which provided new info.But to explain: up from the 11$ to 12.5 lows means also that if prives fall below those levels trend changes.On monday I have done a deep analysis and have seen that the likelyhood to break those levels has increased drmatically.It is fair to my subscribers that they receive this alert exclusively.They have paid a lot of money for that.Everyone can chose to join or not.And as always, everyone needs to make his own trading decisions. I think this is a big problem for bitcoin.And exactly what governments needed to do to avoid bitcoins becoming a real competition to their national cuccency.... By making it so complicated that no normal person wants it anymoreI hope I am wrong... your theory makes sense and is also linked to my chart patterns
the bitcoin market, like any other financial market, behaves irrationally, not rationallyThis is why technical chart analysis can be so effective.The current short term trend has turned down now and lower prices are likely.I will provide key trigger levels and price targets for short and intermediate term in the subscriber section. let me briefly try.(I am on my mobile device and can't post graphs that would be needed to illustrate.)Silver has been underperforming gold since april 2011 and has been shown above in this thread via the gold/silver ratioSilver is also a very good leading indicator fir the broader financial market (stocks, etc). This underoerformance is a key element which I use in firecasting.As long as silver remains below the 50$ mark,silver is in the first stages of amultiyear bear market.Gold will remain a little strongezr than silver because gold is a safer heaven than silver in the financial crisis #2 we are already in.But gold will also at least initially fall hard due to the needed deleveraging of financial institutions and individuals.Basically I am saying that in this second leg of the financial crisis, all markets go down together, just some will fall a bit lessTarget for silver is first the 27-30$ zone and then single digits by 2014-2016.Gold will likely at least test the 1000$ mark before moving to record highs into 2000-5000 and even higher.. prices just broke through a major , supporting chart tredline.That move was anticipated in my technical analysis to my subscribers already monday morningFurther downside is likely unless this trendline is claimed back. silver and gold sre overvalued and will soon drop in dollar terms.Silver will fall faster snd deeper than gold Agree, I wonder how many people were affected in this yet another big mistake from MtGox It looks as if the 11$ wall is the last straw.. before a potential further fall. The trading fees have nothing to do with the price moves. Bitcoin/USD has been in a sideways/triangle chart formation and just broke down a key support zone. This forecast I have given this morning to my subscribers. Short term trend is down now. Still, this does not help creating confidence.Professionalism looks different This is the chicken & eggs phenomenon.Bitcoin volume would very likely go up massively if exchanges had proper security.I know a lot of investors who were thinking about putting real big funds into bitcoin but decided not to because of security issues. Unfortunately you are so right.This is not the confidence investors, traders and normal people interested in bitcoins need to buy some.If I heard those failures of the exchanges back in fall 2010, I would not be here now. I would have never entered bitcoins in such an unstable exchange mess. Just coming back from a long weekend.. and then I see this..It is striking how weak the biggest bitcoin exchange is. Nothing against the mtgox people, but this is another one of countless mistakes on this exchange - massively damaging the bitcoin reputation.The bitcoin community needs fully professional exchanges, at highest security standards.Otherwise, bitcoin will experience even more negative publicity and does not gain the needed broader distribution as most of us want.Personally I am moving to Tradehill or others like CampBX, or whichever exchange finally meets security standards. This is exactly what I have NOT done. I have not harvested the polls.  I can understand your frustration. Let me explain three things.First, the in-depth technical analysis I am doing takes me about 5 hours each to do it properly and to provide me enough confidence to publish it. I want to provide great service, not a half cooked one. I am not sure if it this can be called greedy, but everyone can have its own view here on the forum.Second, the subscription service I am providing is voluntary and there are a lot of people very satisfied with it. Third, I am doing this also to demonstrate that services offered for bitcoin only work, and supporting the bitcoin economy. Now, about the poll, I get your point. I need your votes to be able to publish a meaningful correlation. I still need more weeks to get to a proper picture. I am sure it will be very valid and I promise to publish this one here in this forum first (I have not published this so far).   I have reset the poll again.Vote now. Thanks for your opinion.Up?Same?Down? good summaryIt is true that many bitcoiners got into trading doe th first time and can use some guidance.fundamentals do not really work for bitcoins, particularly in shorter time frames.This is why I am offering technical analysis for bitcoin since Oct 2010 which has guided many bitcoiners well through the storm, and often avoiding irrational trading decisions.The weekly analysis report will cover th current situation in detail Bruce,you are the man.let's make sure you help others to reapply it across the world. I want to thank all subscribers for the great feedback. More to come soon! To get sustainable BTCUSD price rallies, more investors / traders need to join and add funds.This is a key area the community could focus on. Here is the bitcoin group, showing currently 4180+ membershttp://www.facebook.com/bitcoins +1 Vladimir.As most of the time, your comments bring it to the point.And particularly a NASDAQ long only strategy has not a lot of room to rise in the current crisis, particularly not vs. bitcoins if bitcoins stays strong. 
:-) I am not sure if my mission is to spark fun only... It should definitely help making a bit better trading and investment decisions.I have just completed my in-depth weekly bitcoin market and technical analysis which is exclusive to subscribers, and I keep committed to this exclusivity.As always, I will publish some updates here and there on twitter, but with less depth and with a delay.Thanks for your understanding. No, we have broken out above. Further upmove is required to make this a lasting breakout. He was last active  on July 13, 2011, 07:03:24 am, perhaps he is just on vacation and wil respond once he is back or has resolved it.  here is the link to view the charts: http://bit.ly/q3UQ9WLongterm: UP.Midterm: UP as long as the 9.5 $ - 10 $ range holdsShortterm: UP from the 12.5 $ low and down sloping channel resistance. Overall, the forecast about a bullish consolidation and subsequent breakout to the upside has materialized. While the very short term pattern turned out somewhat different to the option presented in last analysis here (bullflag extended further to the downside), the overall direction was correct. Bitcoins are back in a bullmarket on all timeframes. Technical analysisIt is always important to look at the longterm picture before falling into the trap of drawing too short term (and often wrong) conclusions. In German language, we call this "you don't see the forest when you stand  in the middle of the trees".Both, the long and mid term trend are clearly up. The chart below shows that the move down from the all time high of 31.9 $ is corrective, not impulsive. Based on chart analysis tools,  Elliott Wave patterns (not shown) and volume patterns, this view is the preferred scenario.For example, both, the chart pattern and the volume development indicate that the entire move down from 31.9 $ is a consolidation with the most likely resolution to the upside and new highs in weeks/months.Shortterm, and as predicted especially in the subscription service (http://bit.ly/mjP1Rh) , a big rally came last night with strong volume. Most of the 12 day downward consolidation was retraced within just 3 hours, a strong bullish move.BTCUSD are now consolidating this move and likely will move up into the 17 $ - 20 $ area.The BitBulls are in control now, as long as the 12.5 $ low 7 down sloping lower channel line holds. But even if this channel support falls, there is much more support in the 9.5 $ - 12. 5 $ cluster, as short and midterm support levels run in this zone. Trade Bitcoins well!Your S3052 Disclaimer: Please always do your own due diligence, and consult your financial advisor. S3052 owns some bitcoins.  Never invest unless you can afford to lose your entire investment. We highlighted the 11.8-12.5 zone as buy area in the technical analysis subscription. 5 Btc per month and still a few slots available . Agree that it is not helpful to get this thread spoiled.And this is why I return to technical analysis.As analyzed for the subscribers often over the past days, BTCUSD has respected the trendchannel and may have finished this consolidation at today's low.Back to rally mode  unless the 9.5 - 10 $ fails. More detailed buy and sell triggers in the subscription reports.  Once the current consolidation ends with the initial breakout about  a crucial level, the rally will resume to much higher levels.Clear breakout level signals are communicated timely in the subscription service.  +1 This is also how we see it The great thing with technical analysis is actually that all the fundamentals are priced in (current situation and expectations are already mirrored in the chart). That is why you can save a lot of time reading about news, fundamentals, etc. Just focus on the chart and then the next thing is trading accordingly and doing your money management.I am not saying everyone has to do it that way and everyone will be successful, but for me it works brilliantly since many years and that is why I continue doing it that way.I.e. for Gold, most people are already LONG gold and probably some big guys have already started to release their holdings (obviously without telling everybody). This is called "distribution phase": selling to the public, and typically the man on the street buys exactly at the top, where hedges funds, banks, other institutional investors have already dumped it.. UPDATE:We are expanding the service to 50 subscribers since we have added capacity.Send an email to S3052@gmx.ch if you want to secure one of the slots.Of note, our analysis shows that BTC trading will likely soon get much more exciting  This is exactly the case: It is a contrarian indicator. If all the mainstream news and newspapers write about that the dollar will collapse , it is very close to do the opposite.I.e. see the chart for USDCHF. A typical tiring downtrend as evidenced by the wedge formation. Above the 0.835-0.84 zone is breakout to RALLY: The same with Gold which will also start a major correction soon. The first drop will happen in the next 7 days. Yes, currently holding CHF since 2-3 years.But in the next days / weeks shifting to USD as this will have a major RALLY soon for 9-18 months. Believe it or not. thanks. now its working It is true that patience is needed for the breakout. Still, we expect the breakout to the upside from current levels, or slightly lower.  Yes, I agree that the decentralized nature of the bitcoin TECHNOLOGY is the greatest asset and strength.  At the sme time, COMMERCIALLY there needs to be much more synchronized and stronger PR/ER/Marketing efforts to stem against the big negative government and competitive pressure the T&S and the order book dont work for me today, while it was working perfectly before on chrome.Anyone observing the same? I cover in depth assessment of bear / bull situations in my technical analysis subscription service.the picture bithappy painted is not how we see it in the analysis. I am bearish or will turn bearish on PMs, commodities, stocks, almost all asset classes. The upcoming crash will be in line with the all the same market theory: Everything goes down together.This drop will be unprecedented (i.e. much more severe than the 1929 crash) and hence AAPL will also get almost wiped out. The big guys will not fare so well to keep the inequality shift alive for long.The only KING prevailing will be cash and hopefully bitcoins. +1I could not agree more with you.this all comes back to the organizational structure of bitcoin:No unified leadershipNo overall commercial leader / general managerno marketing leaderno pr / er leaderno legal advisor a technical leader Gavin who is doing great, including good interviewsBut the whole thing is weak. This comes also becuse of the decentralized nature of bitcoin.what is needed is a company or non profit organization (ie foundation) that drives this project forward in a structured way  Stock measured in fiat currencies will drop hard. That is what I would wager on. :-)
Nice dream but free markets dont work that way.In the same way US exporters could dream that the USD/EUR, USD/JPY, etc. exchange rates would be stable to plan properly.Instead, hedging is needed for merchants and traders.The same is true for bitcoin. there are some valid points here.However , our analysis shows that we have already seen some capitulation at the 11$ bottom last week.Now BTC are already in stronger hands as you can see in the sideways, bullish consolidation flag. yes at least 60% drop.My expectation is even  a 90% drop, but I am happy to bet on a 60% drop to start with.To those who dont believe in deflation that is already underway since late 1999 should look at the DJI measured in gold. Putting wishes and emotions aside, the patterns look bullish in the short term for a break out higher (either from current levels or a bit lower) I did do backups in some point, but after transferring all coins to the new computer I gave the old computer away...anyway, its gone now and I see the 9 BTC as a way to support the bitcoin community. we have now 21 million coins - 9 BTC :-) - many more people losing some of their coins Hi experts,I have a withdrawal issue.I just withdrew 9 BTC to an address from an old computer that I do nothave anymore (I uninstalled the BTC client beforehand)How can I get the 9 BTC back?thanks I have a withdrawal issue.I just withdrew 9 BTC to an address from an old computer that I do nothave anymore (I uninstalled the BTC client beforehand)How can I get the 9 BTC back?thanks I am happy to bet with you that the DJI will fall below 4000 by 2015, to underline that I am serious with my forecast. By the way, this was possible last year on MtGox and Bitcoingateway.com but was stopped afterwards. On mTGox, due to credit card fraud because of the reversible nature of credit cards In the next 2-5 years BTC will likely be higher than AAPL in $terms.Even if BTCUSD remains at 14$...!Because the upcoming major stock market crash will bring back AAPL to the teens (and I love the Apple brand, have nothing against them, but consumers will not have the $'s left in their purse or credit to affort those high margin Apple products). Chartly's new $BCOIN symbol has its first chart post.http://chart.ly/9dumj9u  I have reset the poll again.Vote now. Thanks for your opinion.Up Same?Down  330 billion $ Nichts fuer ungut...Wir koennen ja "agree to disagree" vereinbaren. Meiner meinung nach waere bitcoin niemals so weit gekommen wir bisher ohne trader, investoren, etc. Spekulanten ist ein sehr nagitiv behaftetes wort.Um meine obige these zu untermauern, gibt es viele untersuchungen die belegen dass es maximal 1 von 1000-10000 tradern / spekulanten schaffen, langfristig profit zu machen.  Sorry, aber dein Kommentar entbehrt jeder Logik und zeigt dass Du Dich mit Handeln nicht gut auskennst.Spekulanten arbeiten mindestens genauso hart wie andere, der Traderjob ist sogar schwerer als viele andere, z.B. Miner. This depends on trader psychology. But as mentioned in my subscription service. We are seeing a short term bullish formation with a breakout of a bullish flag. I expect this to happen in the next 24-48 hours. Sorry for not being clearer before (my mobile device is crap):The weekend dip is a myth. Just because we have seen some weekend weakness for a couple of times does not make a good indicator. More important is the summary of many technical aspects and then build a consolidated picture using many tools. Just using one tool will severely punish those people focusing too much on this one thing.Because even if it works a couple of times, the next time this tool will fail and people sticking too rigidly to it will be washed out of the market.Technical analysis is an art, not a computer program. (this should not sound arrogant, I am not saying I am a perfect analyst, but I have experienced many of these issues a decade ago when I started).Just forget about the weekend effect in bitcoins (or at least use it in conjunction with other analyses). as with many too obvious things and indicators, the weekend dip does not appear to happen. This may causse some buying rush when people realize that they can't get coins cheaper. It I'd always dangerous to look at 1 single indicator true.we may see a rally to higher levels again 
+1 on "short the Dow", but probably as of a bit higher levels. I think we may see another high above 12,900 before this SHORT will probably be the trade of the past centuries.. Not sure what the issue was.Could you try again? It should work again now.  Now its reset.Sorry for thiserror. I have reset the poll.Vote now.Up Down Same? I just posted a brief technical update on bitcoinwatch.As forecasted in my subscri :Pption service, trend is down and BTCUSD is in a midterm bear market.   What's your evidence that 1 single person is causing this?On the technical side you make a good point. There is no reason to buy at current levels for investors. Bitcoin is in a midterm bearmarket. +1it is definitely funny to read those wild theories well done MtGox team.I have critizised the overall lack of professionalism of bitcoin exchanges ,including MtGox and now see some good trends in the right direction.Please continue on that track. There is still a lot to do...  When will it open , finally? They confirmed my account but I seem to have forgot my new passowrd. That is the issue. Which in a normal, professional company is no issue as they can reset it within minutes How can a password be reset. I sent an email to the Goxers, but no reply Great thread. Customer is boss. So, Magical Tux: is it now 24 hours? Can you confirm? Its quite concerning and on top, here is another question that I posted also in another thread:If is is true that MtGox has bitcoins  in their own exchange and is trading them on MtGox (apparently the balance even is up to 500,000 BTC)?Is one actually allowed to trade on his own exchange? If so, the person trading should not have access to anything else than public info, otherwise, it is insider trading. One question arises from this, should it be true that MtGox has 500,000 BTC (or whatever the amount) in their own exchange.Is one actually allowed to trade on the exchange you own? If so, the person trading should not have access to anything than public info, otherwise, it is insider trading. As bitcoin is global, MtGox must give everyone at least 8 hours so that they have a slight chance to get into their account before trading resumes .some people sleep sometimesAnd ideally it should be 12 hours I hope you received the mail I sent you. It took a bit longer  The relation to the topic is that I was responding to tradertimm's post. 2012 may mark a big low already, but the final wave is likely to hit the lows a couple of year later +1The stock market will experience a real crash in the next months and will likely make  a low in the 2014-2016 time zone.The declines from 2000 and 2007 are nothing compared to what will happen. You will be able to collect the Dow under 1000, probably in the 400 range or even lower. mea culpa. thanks klaus.
How can you log into your MtGox account? I thought is is still closed? by the way, is this trustable or a scam??? You know that I appreciate your posts a lot.In this case, though, I disagree:We are not talking private things, but business. In business, "customer is king". If you don't satisfy your customers on a going basis as businessman, you will not get far. Thanks for the diligent perspective. Very helpful+++Still, it seems like MtGox can do almost anything with this unclarity... As suspected before, this is another terrible and confusing information communication. I would not be surprised if it took at least 3-5 days more or even weeks until MtGox reopens.I am happy to be proven otherwise, but it seems they communicate like to airplane passengers: Just 10min delay. Then 10min later: Just another 20 min delay, then ... We could team up and advertise together. You with mining, me with the analysis: "Mine & trade bitcoins" LOL  Gavin, and EFF, this is the best solution in my p.o.v.Wonderful and thanks. +1That is a great one on CNBC. WOW Can you make sure you either stick top this (delayed) new timing or if you do not have confidence, communicate a final timing?It is the worst for all people to not stick to an initially communicated timing.make sure you do not mislead people yet again.Once you reopen, make sure that you are prepared with best security.  I have reset the market sentiment poll.Up?Same as now?Down?I don't know?click on the poll above.Please VOTE Agree with you. The comparison to the flash crash is not making sense. --> zdmasI am an expert in trading and market analysis, but not on exchange regulations. Are you certain this happened? It is not my understanding that the May 2010 flash crash transactions got reversed+1 this makes a lot of sense.And on top, if this takes long, people having funds on MtGox should be able to withdraw them (BTC and USD) and trade them on other exchanges if they want.  This is what typically also happens on other exchanges, correct. Agree that it is difficult...and there is one important overall question:Is the fact that the BTC market was unregulated equaling that the exchange owner can just do anything?I guess many people buying bitcoins at MtGox  were -  rightly or wrongly -  assuming that standard exchange practices were followed. Shouldn't now standard exchange principles apply?The fact that bitcoin is unregulated does not automatically mean that an owner can just ignore standard existing practices of exchanges (and that's what it is).Does someone have some standard knowledge of how normal exchanges would need to treat the issue that happend today on bitcoins?Including placing bid / asks order again where they were or not? I cant believe that.This is completely against every privacy consideration that this file is openly distributed. Having followed and covered the market since Oct 2010, I am concerned about all people investing / trading / loving bitcoins after what happened today.There are a couple of questions:1) Is it legitimate to rollback trades or should the exchange cover the risks?2) What happens to people trading on the other exchanges who where negatively/positively affected by what happened at MtGox?3) How / when should the market reopen?Should orders of users on MtGox be put back where they were before the crash? or is it fairer to ask them whether they want or not?... many more questions...It would be great to have some people experienced in exchanges helping to get an unbiased assessment quickly - to protect all users, and to at least have a chance to re-establish some trust on bitcoins.I am sad, because this was predictable and many including me have warned that we need better, more secure exchanges. And by the way, MtGox can and should not control the exchange rate. If it is legitimate to rollback the trades (legal guys where are you?), the exchange rate will be determined by the bid and ask orders at the time of the reopen. Noone can predict where this will be.Those who are affected need to be asked first, whether they want to place again their bid orders where they have had it.  Exactly, this nightmare is just starting.What can people with MtGox accounts do in the next hours before it is reoponed while the exchange rate sinks in the other exchanges (i.e. tradehill is at 10 $). I feel with all people owning bitcoins. This is a disaster. This is a nightmare for bitcoins as a whole, since it destroys trust.I would not be surprised to see people litigating the exchange because of this issue and I can understand both sides. Those who lost a potential gain with their low buy orders and those owning BTCs who are happy that prices could go back up. What a mess.Again, we need SECURE and PROPERLY MANAGED exchanges as number 1 priority. 
I don't like this, but have to agree with your view:Once people get into their account on MtGox, especially after the weekend, those who had placed orders at 1$ and below, will very likely dream about being millionaires and cash out quickly.The next days will be wild.Nothing for people not experienced in trading.Forget about stable bitcoin rates for a while.And by the way, people should be careful to speculate about that this was not a valid trade. Let's first get the facts. There is nothing illegitimate about an early adopter selling half a million coins.EDIT:The way the BTC were sold(just one huge sell order at probably 0.001) leads me to rather speculate that someone who does not care about money purposely wanted to dump the price (goverment-related body, competition to Bitcoins, etc..) This is where the investigations should look for. Not everyone believes in technical analysis and this is fine. Everyone should chose where he is most comfortable with. For myself and my followers and subscribers, there is great evidence that the technical analysis for bitcoins has worked and still is working very well to time trades.   This is what I also do and it is the only way how it works +1 Stimme dir 100% zu  I have reset the market sentiment poll.Up?Same as now?Down?I don't know?click on the poll above.Please VOTE +1 spot on! I agree it is a bit annoying to see only part of the order book on MtGox.To me it should be either fully open or fully closed. Half way does not make sense. +1 This is really needed. I guess you mena STOP BUY, STOP LOSS, and I would also add to the wishlist TRAILING STOPS, ONE-CANCELS-OTHER, etc. Here a technical update.http://chart.ly/bkh9bpaby the way, where is the StockTwits symbol $BCOIN to pick there. It was announced on bitcoinwatch but I cant pick it.http://bitcoinwatch.com/ There is almost a million $ worth of bitcoins for sale in the mtgox orderbook below the all time high of 32$. This is not bullish The security status of the exchanges is not helpful to build the needed confidence for bitcoin.This is nothing against MtGox specifically, but to me all exchanges lack the minimum security measures that typical exchanges have.Unless this is improved significantly, why would someone take the risk to invest significant funds? If at the same time he reads the DDOS attacks, password stalling, fund stealing... Strong efforts need to be made to provide at least standard security: I.e. transaction number verificaton per each trade, etc.  I have reset the market sentiment poll.Up?Same as now?Down?I don't know?click on the poll above. Will be interesting what the sentiment is after the big decline and subsequent bounce.Please VOTE Thanks.Indeed, I continue to issue public updates (see below)1. Regular technical analysis http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/2. Short term updates on http://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst Danke Dir. Ich finde aber gut dass Du auch analysierst. Kein Analyst ist perfekt, ich auch nicht. I love your creativity. Nice way to describe the current situation.Maybe the wave will only stop at 10$. gute idee.. un ein schritt weiter wäre ein Bitcoin Geldautomat. Hi Du kannst mir gerne bei twitter oder bitcoinwatch folgen, dort analysiere ich regelmaessig BTCUSD mit vielen verschiedenen indikatoren, Elliott Wellen, etc.http://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalysthttp://bit.ly/mjP1Rh Agree with you, this article is just ridiculous. People with no idea about financial markets and trading write this superficial nonsense.I predicted based on technical analysis that BTCUSD will enter a consolidation / correction on Jun 9th. The 30% decline is nothing special in financial markets like bitcoin with high volatility after  a huge exponential rise.Nothing different, and nothing worrying for bitcoins, UNLESS BTCUSD falls through 18-20$ or 10$.
http://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst http://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst No idea what happened to this post.There is still upside towards 40$, which is still a mid term possibility - while short term BTUSD is in a down phase unless the allt ime high is exceeded. If this happens, BTCUSD may reach 40$. agree with you that the slowness of response is hurting bitcoin confidence if this continues. who will invest significant funds from now on, knowing that it might take 48 h or more to get any response, let alone the chance to withrwa funds quickly and not only in 1000$ increments. http://bit.ly/hiRmE7 Back to the question about the 19$ mark: Now it will act as support for when a correction is underway. http://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst http://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst Thanks for the great perspective. Clearly, there are many possible indicators. I typically focus most on PRICE ACTION and PATTERN and use indicators as additional info. Never use indicators alone, becuase they can stay in overbought/oversold condition for a very long time while prices doubles or halves in the meanwhile..

Perhaps people who donated to them should ask their bitcoins back from the EFF.If they do not support bitcoin, they have no right to keep the BTC funds.And, bitcoin do not need them at all, now with all the big buzz.Just my few pearls of wisdom...
it is definitely fun, so here is my referral.http://sldoubler.com/?id=202 . Too many people calling for a collapse or crash...Very likely most of them want to buy BTC cheaper.Not sure if they will be successful, as the Technical Analysis shows a typical pausing consolidation, with another likely upmove to test or break 20$ I thought the same about twitter weeks ago, and now i need to admit that it is much more effective than facebook.Let me think about setting sth up on facebook, but I would like to avoid double work. Is there an automatic twitter/ facebook synchronization? indeed very strong rally , supported by volume and huge momentum.Many people seem to be surprised how fast and far a bitcoin rally goes.There may be people selling at 20$, 50$, 100$ and think they did well... Only to wonder when they look at the exchange rate of 1,000$.this is not a forecast but just an application from what already happened a couple of times on btc/usd: surprise to the upside (rallying 1,000% in just a couple of weeks) I have reset the poll again, so please vote: Up Same as now Down I don't know Agree, I'd see the following people good spokesmen for bitcoin:GAVIN ANDRESENJON MATONISJERRY BRITOa professorand also BRUCE WAGNER(and there may be other I dont know)They should step up even more now and clarify what bitcoin nis about and what is not.[/b][/color] JonI could not agree more Paid 50 BTC to both, bitcool and FreeMoney I shorted Silver again today at 38.5$ (and already declined 5% which is nice 50% at 10 leverage..)Somehow I need to make up for the 100 BTC bet loss :-)It was still a lot of fun to bet wtih you guy, FreeMoney and Bitcool.I am thinking about another one to Silver below 30$. I am sure it will be hit soon, and below 20$ by the end of this year. +1People mining or investing in bitcoins need to always keep in mind that this is HIGH RISK.BTC/USD may fall as fast as they rose in case of a downward spiral.

Here a brief short term update.http://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalystOne thing to add: A break above 7.2 $ could be the first signal that the downtrend from the high may be over.However, this has to be confirmed with a break above the ATH of 8.9$.Unless a new ATH is made, we can see a more protracted correction down to the targets outlined in last Thursday's full analysis (http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/.

I have 11 Subscriptions out of the 20 slots. +1You summarized it perfectly.BTC/USD Prices are at least in a short term downward trend. Here you gohttp://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalystIn a nutshell, given the huge sell orders and the changed short term trend to down, buyers do not need to rush to buy now from a technical perspective.We are in a similar situation as Nov '10 - Dec '10 and Mar - Apr '10. Prices continue down and this can last a couple of months. Here is another example of what I will do in special updates for subscribers as of Jun 1:Preferred count: http://bit.ly/kRhUgY , Alternate count: http://bit.ly/ll3NqM I value people's skepticism and there are 3 points that are important people understand:1) I started the bitcoin technical analysis service back in Oct 2010 because I wanted to see how technical analysis works for this new market. And after 9 months I am very happy with my ability to forecast BTC/USD prices. I also cover Silver, Gold, DJI, SPX, DAX, NDX and I am equally happy with my forecast on those markets.2) I have no interest to do "insider preemption trading" as it would hurt my longterm trust. In fact, I have reduced trading bitcoins recently just because of that.3) Related to the above, I do have huge passion for the bitcoin economy overall, and this is my contribution. Many people in this forum continuously ask for new services to really enable paying things in bitcoins and so I do offer this. The price for one month of subscription is 5 BTC whatever they are worth in USD (as long as they remain above 0.5$).I am perfectly fine if people express their opinion about me and others here in whatever way. They do not need to use my service.I will continue focusing on my customers. As long as they are satisfied, I am happy. Hi ZMoney,what do you mean with your comment. I might not get it..by the way, so far I have firm 7 subscribers. As forecast, the dollar has bottomed and did not break its 2008 low.Significant upside (more +20% in the DXY to above 90) 2 Thanks for your trust already. I have already 5 out of 20 subscribers.

This is the chart before the decline: +1Thanks for this fair assessment. 1. Some people here may remember what I have written when I started this thread on Oct 18, 2010:"For those who are interested in Technical Analysis and to use it to trade bitcoins.A couple of comments first:I will publish on a regular basis my p.o.v. This does not give any trading recommendation. Trading remains at your own risk.I will regularly cover the most liquid markets and I may expand this to others (i.e. btcex in Russian Rubels).Of note: Please don't mix this with fundamentals. This thread is specifically for technical analysis. Of course you are welcome to comment on fundamentals, but I will not reply."2. I have a 12h+ / day job and this is why I am encouraging you to donate some coins as I do this technical analysis on top of this job and my family. As Current-C mentioned, you do not have to.It would be great if you could keep this thread to its initial purpose. thanks in advance BTC/USD behaves like any other financial market when it comes to chart patterns.On the daily chart, we are in the EXPONENTIAL RISING pattern, with high risk to reverse in the next days.On the minute chart, we see an ENDING DIAGONAL pattern, which looks textbook-style. Under this assumption, the top at 9 $ is already in.Key trigger levels are(1) 7.9 $ - 8.2 $ (2) 7.4-7.6 $. Confirmation of exponential reverseFirst target 6 $Second target 4 $Alternate scenario is that BTC/USD makes one more top before reversing down.
Yes, bitcool, I know.We are in the 32-35$ area over the past days. The jury is still out whether we will break 30$ or not, but even if I loose the 50 BTC to you, I am happy since I am short Silver since 43-49 $ ;-) The tree breaks once the exponentially rising lines is broken to the downside.This runs currently between 7.4-7.6$. I am now also there. It is an exponential rise that will see a dramatic reversal.http://bit.ly/kpcFR7 I did a bit more analysis on the exponential rise and took a well known market for reference.We are in a "x-mas tree" pattern, which very frequently happens after exponential rises.I would not be surprised if we see a mirror image on Bitcoins in the next 2-3 weeks,from whatever high will be marked(perhaps it is the current one at 8.45 $ or we see another pop up higher.) the MACD indicator typically is a trailing (not leading) indicator. This means that prices may already be back on the rise, even if there is a divergence in the MACD.I just want to reiterate two things1) We are still in a long and short term rally phase. No evidence yet for any reversal.2) As we have entered an exponential rising phase, the risk for a big drop has increased substantially. Be very careful when trading this market now. It has changed its nature big time.We will see bulls and bears fighting with each other heavily until this is resolved.This is not a market for unexperienced traders (any more). I want to get this back to the original purpose, the technical picture and here it isAs long as those trends hold, we may see higher highs. In any case, I think we will enter exciting times in the next couple of days.While picking the top is difficult, the exponential rise makes BTC/USD very vulnerable to a sudden, hefty set-back.What happened over the past hour is just one small indication (prices dropped 20% in just a few minutes on high volume). Once some folks get nervous and sell bigger chunks, an avalanche may start.But this is normal in markets. Corrections always happen. The question is from where? Current levels, 10£ or even higher. But be alert to a big decline. Forecast materialized real well...New all time high and more to come, given the strength of the rally. 1 me too ;-) And again I have reset the market sentiment poll.Up?Same as now?Down?I don't know?click on the poll abovePlease VOTE 1 I have never made any secret about the fact that I like the bitcoin idea and hold some bitcoins.At the same time, I always provide a fair analysis in both, up and downside directions. Fortunately for bitcoin, there is still so much rising publicity and interest that no major drop in prices is happening.It would still be good to continuously improve liquidity and easy of transcations as this will help bitcoin to get its fair value ... which could be in the thousands when measured in USD if more and more businesses accept it. I am aware of this and this is good, but still far from ideal.If an investor would hear this from a typical broker he still would not have great confidence and as a result may not trade on this very platform, because there are no clear criteria under which conditions higher transactions are allowed.Transparency is key. I have also given you a positive one for being so curious and polite. Some big order came in this afternoon, leading to a breakout to the upside above 3.65$We may test the highs of 4.15 $. Of course, if the exchange does not work, price does not work (change..)Overall, the current situation of the exchanges including MtGox as the biggest, is far from working properly. This can be one fundamental reason why BTC prices may go down significantly. Confidence into the exchanges must be high to attract new funds from investors.Confidence is shaken now with all the DDOS.Secondly, the withdrawal limit of 1000$ per day is a joke for investors. No serious investor will put hundreds of thousands of funds into an exchange if he can not take out funds within hours (max 1-3 days) to shift asset allocation quickly.(This is no blame to people operating the exchanges. They are great entrepreneurs, do this often for free and doing a great job, but this is not enough, given the fact that 11,000 new coins are generated daily, 77,000 weekly, 335,000 monthly = 1.2 million $ at current BTC/USD rate) I will be there at lunchtime on the 25th recent price pattern looks still better if BTC/USD breaks down lower.I'd give this a 65% probability over the next 7 days.
Bitcoins sent.thanks again, error!!!!! Happy to run an Elliott Wave analysis, but as said, I need some support donations because that will take a couple of hours of in depth work, starting from May 2010, the start of trading and running many charts. I have just done that.Success!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!you made it!!!!!send me your bitcoin address and I send you the 10 btc. I did as part of the setup package on github from nefario.but maybe something went wrong.do you have the M2Crypto package separately?Or can I confirm somewhere that the  M2Crypto package is properly installed and works? Thanks a lot. I did exactly what you described. Do I still need to try installing an OpenSSSL program after that or do your 2 files cover that?By the way , I tried bitcoinmarket.py afterwards and I still get the same error message."Traceback <most recent call last>: File "C....\blackmarket.py, line 10, in <module>   from M2Crypto.util import passphrase_callback as prompt_passwordImport Error: No module named M2Crypto.uitl" Agree with daveout.I also need to know in the next 2-3 days to plan properly. http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/2011/05/bitcoin-market-analysis-may-5th-2011-by-s3052/ EDIT: Still does not work..If you can propose some fixes that work, I add another 10 BTC to the bounty of Nefario, making it a  total of 25 BTC. Thanks for the efforts.I have windows 64bit and installed python 2.7The key issue is that no OpenSSl can be installed on this machine. I tried already 5 different versions. I would love to see whats wrong. I am happy to pay you the 50btc each if it does not fall another 4.9$ :-)I made a very good trade as I shortened massively between 45-49 $ and now it is 34.9$. I have tried to install at least 5 different versions of OpenSSl and ALL crashed in the latter half of the installation.It would be great to know how to fix it. So..1) I have deinstalled all VC++ redistributables2) Installed the 64bit version of VC++ per your attached link3) now I am looking for the 64bit version of OpenSSL. How do I get this one?EDITI got one here:http://win32-openssl.soft-ware.net/downloads.asp#dl2Then downloaded the 64bit version and it all looked good until the last millimeters on the progress indicator.. then STOPPED and crash as all the times before in the installation processs.SH.......HELPplease...I committ suicide... Nope, I just slept...I will try to do the uninstall / install tonight and then report back to you kokjo,I went to the link, which one should I install?thanks for the help in advance thanks.Before I start this, should I remove ALL of the redistributables (just to ensure I dont crash my entire system..) Hi Reto,i did exactly what you described. I have windows 7 64 bit. I changed the windows settings, added the additional info on the path.Then, unfortunately the OpenSSL 32 light installation stopped at the same point as before. (should I reboot before trying that?)Perhaps I soon need to uninstall other OpenSSL versions, in line with what "error" described. After installing all the programs from setup as described, I tried to run the marketwith blackmarket.pyThen I got the error:"Traceback <most recent call last>: File "C....\blackmarket.py, line 10, in <module>   from M2Crypto.util import passphrase_callback as prompt_passwordImport Error: No module named M2Crypto.util"can anyone help? Thanks cosurgi. I will definitely continue as long as the trading resumes.It was not too bad as I focused my spare time the past days more on the Silver SPOT market and I am quite happy to have picked the Silver top at 49.9 $ last Monday. Now we are at 40.9 $... seems like I can take vacation from the bitcoin technical analysis...this is terrible... They are applicable as BTC is from a technical standpoint not different from other markets. At the same time, BTC/USD price pattern history is still young and it is always open to various interpretations as to in which wave we are currently. We can easily count different scenarios: (i) We are in a 3rd wave up, which implies a further continuation. (ii) we are in the last 5th wave up with one more high before the end of that wave, (iii) Or we have completed the last 5th wave already at the last high and will soon see the longest correction since the start of trading, or (iv)...This all depends on whether we include the bitcoinmarket trading before MtGox started or not.. You see, it is quite complex at this stage.I can issue a more in depth Elliott Wave analysis if there is enough interest in the community and some people want to donate some coins, as this will require at least 3 hours which is difficult for me. (I need to add volume, sentiment measures, other indicators on top of Elliott to most accurately determine in which wave we are and narrow down the scenarios - and most importantly, come up with a favorite scenario).Just let me know.
Here we go:The link to the update and yes, the uncertainty around MtGox may trigger profit taking.http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/2011/05/bitcoin-market-analysis-may-2nd-2011-by-s3052/ And again I have reset the market sentiment poll.Up?Same as now?Down?I don't know?click on the poll abovePlease VOTE Mt Gox is based in Japan now since owner changed. Buy Gold puts :-) Yes, that is correct. Resistance / support is the upper trendline of the price channel.It is true that at this stage, we cannot know for certain which channel line the market thinks is more important. The log scale around 3$ +-0.15 or the nominal trend line around 1.6 $.I will run a deeper analysis on Monday, trying to shed some light on this.In the meanwhile, it is evident that prices turned down from the parabolic rise. In a way, BTC/USD may have entered a similar path like Silver. Silver will likely crash down hard once the parabolic rise is over. Either from current levels around 48$, or after another rise into the 55-60$ area. ` 1 cool. Do you also have the remaining part?I would be interested to hear the questions and answers?If you dont have a video, can you share the essence of the Q&As?thanks He is even more genius than I thought if he purposefully selected the name Satoshi because of the 2007 "find Satoshi" noise..! 1 All it takes is a ~20k $ order to evaporate the 2 $ level and generate upside potential way beyond that. Given the healthy technicals, a further acceleration to 5$, 10$ should not surprise people too much. +1 http://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst Actually I agree the guy looked very likeable.When writing "get him" I was interested to find out who he is, now knowing that you know him, even better: Now we may be able to explain a bit better what the benefits of bitcoins are. It would be funny to find out who the guy is. It should be put "wanted" somehwere..If he is in the US, maybe PLATO can get to him on his road trip and convert him to bitcoins (selling for a few carrots as Plato needs food)  Why don't people not interested into cypherdoc's call for help discuss their egoistic views somewhere else so that we can get back to the original thread motive? Yes, the pattern down from the high is not bearish. Low volume, slow move downwards.It seems we get another bull run soon. Just depends from where it exactly will start. +1Thanks and lets continue to hold a strong position against illegal things here. when did this person leave this comment? which date? Fundamentally, there will likely be new fund inflows to buy bitcoins in the next days - given the massive news coverage.People who sell now between 1.6 and 2.0 might be surprised if prices break above 2 $ with big momentum.The bitcoin market is so small that a small investor can drive the value up to 3, 5, 10 $ with ease.
Sorry for not being serious enough.. but I dont need more carrots.. we have a full supply here.. Can I reserve one part for pink carrots? Bitcoin Techncial Update. Bull flag with most likely break out to the upside. http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/ +2This is the only way forward for a sustainable Bitcoin success. Overbought. It is corrected now (thanks for spotting the typo) I am watching always 2 arrays of time frames:short term (hourly, 15min and shorter)mid/long term (daily, weekly)And then putting the conclusions together of those sets of information.And on top of all the time frames and indicators, I use my experience gained over the past 12 years, which results in a kind of gut feeling (which essentially is a synthesis of what the brain has soaked in and filtered and saved..). This one I cant really explain ...By the way, I am more active in the forum than usual since I have 1 week off my normal job. Although I really like being more active here, don't expect the same frequency of responses in the next weeks.On the question about the direction of the BTC/USD market, I have just completed an in-depth longterm analysis. Tops are typically hardest to pick, no matter of short or mid/long term tops. My highest probability view is that we have not seen a top yesterday. The uptrend is very robust.http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/2011/04/bitcoin-market-analysis-special-long-term-update-april-24th-2011-by-s3052/ As previously mentioned, corrections can take 11 different forms, including triangles. Triangles themselves, can also take different shapes (acending descending, symmetrical and there also exist "running" triangles).It is always possible that break out of triangles after an uptrend can be on the downside, but there are two reasons why I made the bullish call(1) Bitcoins "love triangles". If you go back to the history of the bitcoin technical analysis, you will see that probably >90% of all triangles were resolved to the upside.(2) Last days trend was extremely bullish with record buying volume. Typically, triangles form at the end of bullish phases (Elliott 4th wave position), but will be followed by one more rally (Elliott 5th wave).Anyway, I may be wrong this time. All analysis is based on probabilities and this one was the highest probability call. THIS IS AWESOME!!!!You know what? Seriously, I think this is the best viral campaign for bitcoins and we should thank this guy.If this was planned to market bitcoins, it is ingenious. Forum members, it would be helpful to get back to cypherdoc's original intent of this thread (see above and again here:)so i'd like to hear productive ideas about how this can be accomplished.Here are my ideas to start with:(1) Get all illegal content off this forum. This is already in progress, at least for (i) stuff that is illegal everywhere, and (ii) stuff that is illegal in most jurisdictions. People who want to talk about those things can do this somwhwere else, outside of bitcoin.org(2) A step further would be to publically announce on the homepage of bitcoin.org that bitoins have been created as innovation in the payment / store of value area and that the owners of bitcon.org are against illegal abuse. Of course, as with cash, some individuals may use bitcoins for other things, but bitcoin.org does not endorse this in any way and even undertakes all possible steps to avoid this on this website(3) Continue driving bitcoin's legal use for low fee payments, legitimate businesses, start-ups, investments, etc. I agree with you. Goverments might think that bitcoins are a threat for their currencie and hence a higher std is needed. It hit already 2 $ in bitcoinmarket.com in past 24 hrs.New poll  is needed. 1 you have a good point. corrected:http://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst If this +300% rally over the past 20 days only gets some media attention (which I am sure it will), we may see follow through buying next week once people can add more funds to the exchanges.There are no big resistances before the psychological 2.0 $, and even this one can be evaporated fast. http://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst And again I have reset the market sentiment poll.Up?Same as now?Down?I don't know?click on the poll abovePlease VOTE This is a great approach. thanks so much  Rally is on, indeed.My forecast rather points to an acceleration of the rally than to an end.We would need to see weakening indicators, including negative divergences before declaring the recent uptrend over.Some people may be surprised how high BTC/USD will be after Easter, before they will be able to wire funds to jump on the rally.There is big BID volume in the order book. People who become worried to miss the train may decide to buy at current levels before we are at 2 $ - 2.3$Surprises are rather likely on the upside. Bitcoin exchanges are open 24/7 which is another great benefit for bitcoins.Wish you a happy EASTER TRADING.Perhaps you will find an easter egg among the bitcoins :-)More seriously, I am going to spread the word on weekend trading to some traders as some of them can't live an hour without trading. the GERMAN yellow press BILD could be a fantastic mediumwww.bild.deunfortunately I dont know a BILD reporter...
PLATO you are a hero!Just brainstorming some more ideas:* you could host a bitcoin barbecue somewhere on the way. people bring the meat and beer, you eat, and in eating pauses tell them about bitcoins* Bitcoin fireworks. lets get some people to stand in the bitcoin coin symbol arrangement and fire some fireworks in the sky* you draw a bitcoin onto the map (round shaped coin + the "B" symbol by making this your trip pattern) I am happy to donate some coins if you need more fuel for the car 1 1 No offenseI like you bringing useful information into this forum. It would just be great if you can help getting most clarity into this complex matter... Thanks, there are still 2 questions:1)  I am still not 100% clear whether the Department of Treasury really assessed bitcoins or whether they just sent the old 2005 ruling to davidonpda.I recall someone in the forum asked him to send the official letter and I am not sure if this happened.It would be great to get clarity.2) If FinCEN regulations would apply, what would be the implication for bitcoins? Would the FinCEN regulations automatically apply if trading volume is higher than 1 $k? If you are not a lawyer, what makes you credible to write an article about that?You better get top experienced lawyers with financial and payment expertise to work this article with you before it will contain only a bunch of wrong asumptions.My few bitpennies. How sure is it that the "store of value" call on bitcoins is really correct?It would be closer to a digital commodity.and i am not aware of trading restrictions on commodities of 1 k$... Thanks for clarifying+ Just observed that in the past 24 hours, we have 7,149,570.84Bitcoins sent.Is this the highest ever? Are there individual big chucnks of BTC sent around? IS Satoshi active again :-)  ?? 1 BTC/USD is developing another triangle pattern, which so often has been BULLISH.As soon as prices move significantly above 1.10 $, a new acceleration of the rally is likely. And again, I have reset the market sentiment poll.Up?Same as now?Down?I don't know?click on the poll abovePlease VOTE I confirm to be there on May 25 in the morning around 10:30 AM and need to leave by train around 5:30 PM again. Let me know if this can work for you.In case not, I need to think about planning to stay overnight somehow. consider it done via twitter:http://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst thats what I mean+1 I think it is crucial to rather comply with the needed regulations. Otherwise, this bitcoin poker activity could easily kill bitcoins as government would go after it. http://www.businessinsider.com/online-poker-websites-fraud-2011-4Pokersites shut down..Be careful. wow.this is epic.Shouldn't we find a journalist to join Plato for a bit and report about bitcoins and Platos great courage?who knows a journalist in the us who could be interested? I also got convinced that the train is probably best. Lets plan for that..Lets see if we can brand out train compartment with BITCOIn :-) wow. Thanks so much.one can easily underestimate the time it takes to execute "simple" additions.
I have not been able to input early in the game, and I accept if this is too late.What could be really very helpful for the bitcoin economy at this stage is attracting more investors.A simple stand alone video or a part in the above discussed video that is transporting this message would be ideal.A message track could be as follows:Over the past years, most equity markets have not provided significant yields any more. For instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down -14% vs. its high in 2007. And even worse, due to currency devaluation and deflation the stock markets are down -50 to -70% when measured in "real money": Gold.Bitcoin is the new Gold 2.0 with even more advantages:1) Bitcoin has grown over 3000% percent in the last 15 months, and is only bound to increase further since supply is fundamentally limited.  2) Bitcoin is better divisible as Gold and can hence be used for payments.etc. ... @tcatmAgain, congrats, this is fabulous.There are two things that be also be very helpful.The first one is adding weekly time fram for the charting tool. This would enable me to do a better longterm analysis, now that the bitcoin exchange is almost celebrating its first birthday (bitcoinmarket started in May 2010).The second one is probably a bit more difficult, which is adding a comparison option of BTC vs. Gold Spot prices. We have talked this before, and I dont know how feasible this is.Perhaps a coder can help out.The benefit would be that the LAYMEN would immediately see that bitcoins are the #1 investment of all on the planet, even better as gold. (and also silver)  correct, as I have stated in the report:"As forecast, BTC/USD have indeed broken impulsively above 0.8$ and also above 0.9$, which paved the way to PARITY again." 1 Thanks so much.I am happy if my followers are happy.I may not always be right, but I am trying all the time. 1 No, je suis Allemand, et j'habite a Geneve.... thats about how great my french is... so I switch to English now..I would drive the 500 km to Paris if it works out. 1 I'd love to join as well.For me, May 25th could work. is this you?http://www.linkedin.com/pub/colby-adams/15/219/696 info@mtgox.comI hope you are a decent person with positive intent, because this email can be found on the home page, on the bottom of every page, basically everywhere you see this email address... Booked.I am fine with whatever source, as long as it tracks New York SILVER SPOT. kitco is fine, see link:http://www.kitco.com/charts/livesilver.html#ny Freemoney and bitcool:Will do 50 btc with each of you.On silver spot price trading below 30 at least intraday before may 31, 2011. As long as the trend continues, 10$ is not unachievable.who thought prices double every 6 weeks? Who thought bitcoins rise 13fold in only 5 months last year?and, dont forget , I did not give a time target yet. We will need to evaluate the price action once (and if) BTC/USD make a new all time high. done, and also tweeted ithttp://twitter.com/BitcoinAnalyst  http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/http://twitter.com/#!/BitcoinAnalyst 1 don't worry, I am glad we have this fruitful discussion. It's all a matter of definition. You can say that between 0.7 - 0.8 we are in a sideways territory. I will publish my analysis in the next minutes to bring this into the broader perspective. Just to clarify. I never said it will go down below 0.7I just said, the short term TREND is down as long as 0.8 $ is not broken to the upside. And prices went down from 0.78 to 0.72 (again hitting 0.72 today)
>sturleFundamentally , I agree with you 100%. BTC7USD can take off big time if the trend continues.From a technical standpoint, there are big hurdles to pass. Update shortly on bitcoinwatch. My reasoning is based on technical chart analysis.I am happy to bet 50 BTC that Silver will dip below 30$ before May 31, 2011 (intraday prices based Spot in USD). This is not a typo. Yes, below 1,000 , possibly below 400.I went short at 12,450 and will add to this short position as long as the DJI stays below 12,900. I have a larger position in the NDX (NASDAQ 100) which is underperforming vs. the DJI (this is a bearish sign). I will help out a couple of hours per week via  twitter and on forexfactory forum. I know these sites, but dont agree with their view.Having observed the bitcoin market for 6 months on a daily basis, my only point is that the bitcoin trading has become smoother since the introduction of dark pools.anyway I am not the decision maker, and accept either decision. Agree with you.Also, the poll should only be open to registered users of MtGox. It is about satisfying current customers, rather than given people a right to vot who has absolutely no clue about trading. thanks for your perspective!Great BTC/USD short term trend change: DOWN after reaching 0.8 and breaking below 0.75. 0.50, better 0.56 $ must hold to keep longterm rally. No, you're not getting it yet.All trades, no matter of dark pools only, dark pools + normal and normal only are visible. You can ask the exchange owner if they can provide you with an analysis how much % of the last 24 h trades were ingnited by dark orders. You are wrong here.The dark pool trades are all part of all the trades you see on bitcoincharts.comhence, only the dark trade offers are invisible, while the resulting trades are treated in the same way as other orders. Net, dark pool do not mask any volume.This is based on what I heard from the owners of MtGox. If this is confirmed, dark pools have only positives. Agree 100%.Stopping dark pool will in all likelyhood increase the spreads = making buying and selling bitcoins more expensive for most people. Silver will soon make a top. But due its exponential rise that started in January, we are now in a "blow off" top formation. Those blow off tops overshoot very often. This means it can go up to 50 $ or it can mean that last nights high is already the top.It could be prudent to wait for a short entry until 36.40-36.50 is broken to the downside which could be a first sign that a top is in place. If a top is in, we probably see the steepest decline of silver in decades.Gold is in a similar position and will need to break below the March low to confirm a top. Thanks...Now we are really getting close to another big top in the stock market.My projection is that we are maximum 4% away from the final top in the DJI, SP500, NASDAQ.Targets, i.e. on the DJI below 1000 over the next 2-5 years. It fits really well to the technology behind bitcoins, while it carries the risk of being perceived as blocking something and sounding a bit negative.. For people not deep in the matter this might repell them.  Short term update:http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/2011/04/bitcoin-market-analysis-short-term-update-april-6th-2011-by-s3052/ slush and bitcool,we agree 99%, I am using simple price action patterns and simple indicators for most of my analysis and trading. I also think that finding the right trade entries is simpler than most people think. Much more difficult is the money management. This is why 1 out of 1000 traders make consistently money over years. This is why most of the rest do well over weeks, months, maybe a couple of years, but then lose everything.While the above mentioned indicators make up for most of my trading decisions, I enhance this with elliott wave sometimes because is has one benefit that many other dont have: it is forward looking. my biggest and best trades were countering the main trend, where most other indicators did not indicate the trend change.i.e. I bought European stocks on March 12, 2003 (the day of the low), I shorted the stock market on Nov 26, 2007 (just 2-3 days before the top), due to Elliott wave AND ALSO the other indicators. Bitrade http://bitrade.com/not takenSorry nefario, I promised to share some ideas earlier, but was too busy lately. if we like it or not, this is the only way to keep bitcoin growing. what is wrong if a bitcoin exchange / forex market is under the umbrella of such an institution, which does the same as the current exchanges (MtGox, bcm, bcex, b2cash...) but provide the infrastructure and scale of the needed compliance with the processes?unlike other financial assests, they can not change a bitcoin, nor the number of bitcoins in the universe. I mean an officially registered and regulated financial institution.Currently, many investors shy away getting into bitcoins because the exchanges are not trustable enough (even if I think they are great and I have full trust in them). What they lack is the credibility of i) a good history of acting as exchange and ii) the lack of transparency that they are "legal" and obey the needed processes. Interested, I fared very well over with Elliottwave over the past 9 years.I'd be interested to learn what your experience is (feel free to share here or via PM).
http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5501.msg80589#msg80589We see some great progress when looking at the above post. This could be big for bitcoins. This is just great.As a bitcoin market analyst, I think all ideas are very interesting, and particularly the 3rd one is probably the most urgent and the one with the biggest short term positive impact.As much as I like the current bitcoin exchanges, they lack the trust backing in the "non-bitcoin" world. A true forex market, back by a trusted institution would probably make bitcoins much more believable.my few bitcents of wisdom... yes, if only there were significant volumes.There need to be stop loss orders possible on the big exchange MtGox for "Average Joe" who does not even know what a bot is. I predicted the break towards 0.5 on my technical analysis.However, there is not yet the chance to do stop loss trading on any BTC exchange, which is making it impossible for people like you to protect against losses.This is what I meant in other threads: We need more professional exchanges, offering the proper instruments and tools.  genjix is the perfect example of what I mean. All,as you observe, despite press coverage, bitcoin is on a decline (yes, exchange rates are not everything, but trust me this is crucial. If there won't be a continuous fund inflow into the bitcoin economy, the entire Bitcoin project may crash big time)This is a negative spiral.1. BTC exchange rates drop2. Investors shy away3. BTC exchange rate drops more4. Miners are not profitable any more. They start selling5. BTC exchange rate drops more..6. BTC/USD soon will be where it started7. Press coverage announces the death of this "geek" idea..8. Maybe bitcoin can get up on its feet again,. but it is very tough after a big crashThis is not meant negative, but positive:WE NEED PEOPLE DRIVING the BITCOIN project forward properly. And not only look at their own profit or debate hours in the forum about minor things.They should (re)invest part of their income into MARKETING of bitcoins, CREATING new businesses, etc. in a much more sincere way. I know some people are doing this in a great way already, but it seems it is only a handful.For instance, a professional operated and marketed exchange is one element that is desperately needed. An exchange that can handle big volumes and can be trusted by investors. properly working exchanges are desparately needed.The current situation does not spark any trust with investors. Agree with you.And it is even more than that:The current rate of mining creates 7,000-10,000 bitcoins per day, 50,000 - 70,000 per week, 200,000 - 280,000 per month. This creates a lot of supply which, if not absorbed by buyers of bitcoins results in a  lot of technical overhead pressure on BTC/fiat currencies. catching a falling knife can be very dangerous Brilliant Idea+1 1 1 And again, it is Monday (or at least in my time zone it will be in 26 min), and I have reset the market sentiment poll.Up?Same as now?Down?I don't know?click on the poll abovePlease VOTE Makes 100% sense to me. +1 https://www.privacyfoundation.de/verein/spenden/ I am not the owner of bitcoincharts. I am independent. tcatm is the owner and has asked my if i would post my analysis there which I happily accepted.I really like your comments, and I did not want to create the perception that you are not credible. After seeing you posting more than the first thread, I see that you have expertise and I like the discussion. For perspective, we had a couple of newbees there trying to create scam-type of threads very often. But you are not one of them. I have revised my blog to not put you in the wrong spotlight. Hope this is fine now.This is what I am saying, we are on the same page. Currently, the market is in a sideways range and it might not be very wise to buy now within this congestion area. You may wait for a clear breakout. If a breakout happens, the upside is quite big, because as you say, the market is tiny and if significant funds flow in, it is not irrational to say that 2,5,10$ can be reached fast (10x higher). Recall when prices were in the 0.065$ congestion area in September 2010: Within 6 months, prices increased 15x. http://blog.bitcoinwatch.com/2011/04/bitcoin-market-analysis-special-review-april-3rd-2011-by-s3052/ http://www.atmmarketplace.com/blog/5586/-The-BitCoin-Projectvery positive mention+ 1 Hi Everyone,what would cause the BTC exchange rates to rise? FUND INFLOWS INTO THE EXCHANGES from existing and / or new users. To make the BTC/USD exchange rate rise, the economy needs around 8000 BTCs worth of inflows every day (160 blocks per day * 50 = 8000 BTC). This of course assumes that all miners convert all back to USD regularly and dont save bitcoins at all, which is not 100% correct.Still, there needs to be significant money inflows into BTCs regularly as we know that miners need to offset their costs and pay off hardware, pay electricity etc.What could make BTC rates fall: no further money inflows make the BTC/USD rate fall on its own weight (because of the BTC inflation due to mining)This means that ideally every current bitcoin users should convince another new user to start getting into bitcoins.Perhaps we can start a tell-a-friend mechanism where there are incentives for existing users?
no idea how many active users on mtgoxBased on how little trading goes on currently, its probably a handful or a dozen maximum who trade regularly this is just my opinion as I am not part of any exchange management or related in any way.You should ask Jed or magicaltux directly 1 The above method described by jgarzik would be the best way to show BTC/Gold in $. I don't know how difficult it is to pull Gold/USD prices from a third source, but definitely this would be very accurate.This would also be a phenomenal measure of success for Bitcoins overall. Since its creation, BTC has outperformed Gold by galaxies.. We should track how this continues.And then, if BTC/Gold continues to perform well, this could be used as a strong marketing sell to the public:Bitcoins is Gold 2.0 - better, faster and much lighter. I have alreadysent dishwara 2.88 in bitcoins Dear bitcoin-folks:1. You can follow my Bitcoin Market and Technical Analysis in realtime via Twitter now.2. I will also start to cover Gold in USD, Silver in USD, S&P500 and Nasdaq 100 markets as of now http://twitter.com/#!/S3052 Can you specify what you mean with your opinion? Sorry, I apologize. This was not meant badly. Send me a PM with a bitcoin address and we will find a solution and then I will send you the coins. Great. Finally we will be able to see you on CNBC soon. Look at MtGox website. It shows that you can also do ACH wire transfer in the US and Euro wire transfer in Europe.no need to worry about liberty reserve The Poker room overall is a great project.Just one minor suggestion for the homepage: You could revise it and remove the "you can generate coins" part, as most people entering the poker room would be "non-miners" and therefore should not be disappointed by the false expectations of generating coins. 1 I will publish my Bitcoin Technical Analysis in a few minutes.The orders around 0.95$? This just means there needs to be buying volume of approx. 10 $M to wipe them out. This is nothing if we see fund inflows. Just imagine you have 10 people transferring 1,000 $ each to MtGox via wire transfer..Or, if it does not happen, prices may ppause and consolidate around the 0.86-0.95 area for a while. this is a great visual, and fits perfectly to the rally mood It is important to think about all profiles of traders / investors. There are many different types:1) Scalpers: They constantly try to make incremental (small percentages) profits from small market movements2) Market makers: They always put the highest bid and lowest ask in the system and are happy with 1-2 % gain per trade.3) Swing traders: They try to profit from buying low and selling high from a couple of days or weeks.4) Longterm investors: They have a years+ time horizon.5) ...If your comments only go to group 4), it may sounds right that they would not sell now, but you have all sorts of other traders already in the bitcoin market who buy and sell very often. This is actually a good sign since they add liquidity to the market and keep spreads low. Hi lzsaver, can you explain a bit more? I am not sure I understand. The Rally is underway.See post here:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1493.260 1 Super btc, thanks a lot.And to be clear, I do not say prices can't be driven in a certain direction. What I am saying is that this was a typical action that exchanges enable.In normal stock markets, you can always buy up the value of certain stocks that are illiquid. But then the decisive phase comes aftwr: Either othere people jump on the bandwagon and prices stay up and move higher, or the next trade will be down again and then nothing happend (except of you losing some money).As you can see on BTC/USD, the price has stayed up, which means we saw a decent rally, with rising volumes, which is a healthy sign. There were previous price spikes caused by some few individuals which were not sustainable, but this one currently is.Overall, the market moves in a very similar fashion as stock markets or forex markets.If you want to know how the market can be "manipulated", this is quite easy. If you look at the order book https://mtgox.com/trade/history, you see how much money it takes to move the market into a certain direction. This is not 100% accurate as there are dark pool orders on top of visible orders.In any case this is a good overview.i.e. you need:on the upside6 $M to break 0.90$18 $M to break 0.95$21 $M to break 1.00$ (parity36 $M to break 1.10$ and make a new all time highon the downside4 $M to break through 0.8$9 $M to break through 0.7$This means that the small size of the market enables big price moves with low funds. On the other hand, this will change with time. Once BTC economy will have moved from 5 $MM to 50 $MM or 500 $MM, you need much more funds and market will be much more liquid.  vladimir,sure.the 50d EMA is a often successfully used technical indicator for financial markets. I realized that it fitted very well the hourly charts over the past month.As you can see in the chart, the 50d average could be used as a trading signal.i) Once BTC/USD prices are below, we remain in a downtrendii) Once BTC/USD rates are above we are (at least in a short term) uptrenddoes this help? Let me know if not and I will try to address it asap
sent you a few bitdimes ;-) this is Ultra Cool, Man! thanks I like that, so yes, >>>btc, please change it.[/b]As explained also by others, yesterday's rise was absolutely normal. I followed the market almost every 30mins over daytime, since I do not work this week.Some observations over the past 7 months since I started to cover bitcoins as analyst:1) The BTC/USD exchange rate follows technical patterns known from other financial markets in an almost textbook manner. There is herding psychology involved as for every other market: Flat, almost dead periods are followed by sharp rises or declines. As for stocks, commodities, etc. typically markets move in only 20% of time, but this makes up for more than 80% of the price changes.2) The specific rise yesterday was predictable on the 10 day chart where prices coiled under the 50 day exponential moving average and once breaking above this line, accelerating quickly to much higher levels (0.8, 0.82..)3) The spread is typically in the range of 0.5-5%, depending on the market dynamics. The small spread you observed yesterday was within the normal range and changed back to typical 2-3% right after. The spread just depends on what people put as bid and ask orders, and it can always happen that they get very close. Nothing special about that.by the way, you will find my analysis soon also on bitcoincharts.comand if you would be so kind, please change the thread title now. o.k.I will explain more later (I am on the run now and will get back to you this evening) >btc: Seriously: can you please rename the title of this thread into something less invasive?Feel free to discuss about market fundamentals and learn how markets work, but stop this manipulation talk (or are you again Baron?).If I were an owner of an exchange, I would get an injunction against you granted you for this accusation.The rise yesterday was a normal market movement. 1 me too. As you can read in my latest Technical Analysis, the BTC/USD may have started again (bottoming around 0.71 over the past days).http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4487523#post4487523 Prices on MtGox are rallying today, must be because they all want to buy coins to send to noagendamarket ... You were right that 1.1 $ was a significant high.The only thing that was wrong was the title, because it was not a bubble, but a standard correction. Bubbles lead to a massive crash and typically take the shape of a x-mas tree.As discussed in my analysis, we see a standard consolidation from the high. It is currently printing a textbook style bull flag, poised to break out to the upside again.

We should treat this with high alert and importance.If we don't get the awareness higher soon, bitcoin might decline significantly and eventually get forgotten.At least there is some substantial risk. As far as I am concerned, I'd call it "DEAL".I will transfer the BTC immediately once you have done the steps that you outlined above. this, 'our' community should try to come up with new ways to gain more press awareness, which is a great way to drive bitcoin forwardWhat are your ideas? And what will you personally do to make it happen? ich stimme allem zu, insbesondere der notwendugkeit, neue leute anzusprechen.In erster linie investoren, businessangels und trader.Ich vermarkte bitcoins auf einigen foren zb forexfactory.com, wallstreet-online.de Damit habe ich einige groessere investoren uebsrzeugt und dies hat geholfen bitcoins von 0.3 auf 1.1$ steigen zu lassen.Ich schaffe es allersings alleine nicht mehr. Vielleicht koennt ihr euch auch auf obengenannten foren anmelden und mitmachen, und auch neue ideen einbringen A rare fundamental addition from my p.o.v: The bitcoin economy needs new investors to support the next rally. Otherwise, there is a risk for negative investment sentiment which could harm the overall bitcoin economy. We already see less mining and investor interest.As promised here is tonight's bitcoin technical update. As some of you might have realized, I have moved to a Monday & Thursday rhythm for the technical analysis. In case the market starts again to be more dynamic and I get some of your support via donations, I might move to a shorter rhythm again.http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4470542#post4470542I post updates in the forexfactory to keep interest up and as the mtgox blog is not active any more since ownership changed. This is a very good proposal. I am all for it.Let's continue to call for donations until Wednesday and then proceed. "Bitcoin - die Bank sind wir".. das ist grossartig. Current donation status: around 258 BTC (will get the precise number from blockexplorer)Thanks so much already to those warmhearter bitcoiners.Here suggestions on how to move on:1. We call out deadline for the first donation wave until 12:00 GMT on Wednesday, March 16    We need a moderator and/or the thread owner edric to announce this more broadly on the forum, to call for all donations people are willing to make.2. In the meanwhile, until Wednesday, we decide on where to donate to. I think it is best to donate to an organization that uses our funds in the epicentrum of the quake and tsunami (in the Sendai area)One example could be for affected children in Japan (but clearly we will let the people who donate to add other suggestions and decide ultimately via voting. Please add your favorite in this thread). http://www.savethechildren.org.au/what-we-do/emergencies/japan-earthquake3. I will then change the BTC into USD and then either wire it to the organization or use PayPal if they accept it (unless they accept bitcoins..)Done and at least something good will happen with our bitcoins.If there is more interest afterwards, we can run a second round of donations, but I prefer we make a big call to the entire bitcoin community to donate as much as possible for the 1st round until Wednesday, 16th and then we close it. All righty. It's clear.Let's continue to watch the exciting developments. SGornick, this is great.keep going! still increasing, just seeing another 22.6 BTC flowing in.How long should we collect?perhaps someone of the moderators here you place this call for donations high and prominent in the forum, potentially on bitcoin.org homepage temporarily to collect more.Possibly calling for donations until a certain time and we then decide to issue the donation to our selected organization. Agree.Japan needs support.And this is not dependent on what happens or not to the Fukushima plant. Here some ideas which organization to select.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/11/how-to-help-japan-earthquake-relief_n_834484.html There is nothing wrong trying to convince one of the smaller ones to open up a bitcoin account and address to accept donations.But if not, I'd still go ahead donating what we collect here. Disagree in terms of who is leading what:BTC vs. other fiat currencies (largely BTC/USD, BTC/EUR) are LEADING indicators, the others are following. BernankeWithoutCoins.com;-)
1 Bitcoin: Gold Standard 2.0 (from nofuture if he does not mind :-) Status:158.82 BTC You are right, let's "just" help them to get out of this mess.Of course we will mention that donations were collected via Bitcoins.I also like the idea of looking for smaller aid organizations. Let's see what we can find over the next couple of days. Suggest the following approach:1. Let's collect Bitcoins as first priority.2. And then tomorrow review the options for donating (to which organization, for what help purpose)We could do a poll for those who have donated to decide where to doinate the funds.Current status: 51.82 BTC I am donating 30 BTC myself immediately. . Japan needs support.The nuclear power plant just exploded. As with any of these oversimplistic and lopsided correlations, this correlation will fail to make sense at some point. Those who believe too long in a certain correlation will be surprised if it doesn't exist any more.See USD / stock market correlation, see Oil / stock market correlation, etc. Over some months, or years there is a positive correlation, over another period the correlation is non-existent, and over another period it is negative.Be careful with this. Just realized we crossed the 10,000 viewer mark of this Bitcoin Technical Analysis thread.Thanks to all of you for reading. I will be trying to keep it useful for you. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4465929#post4465929 Klasse Initiative!Und go-bitcoin ist auch eine sehr gute deutsche Seite. As promised here is tonight's bitcoin technical update. As some of you might have realized, I have moved to a Monday & Thursday rhythm for the technical analysis. In case the market starts again to be more dynamic and I get some of your support via donations, I might move to a shorter rhythm again.http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4462083#post4462083 Hi Everyone,and especially hi and thanks to all who have been donating!Over the past 2-3 weeks, donations have declined from a good level to almost 0. I still want to continue the BTC analysis, but need to move to a less frequent update (2x per week), as otherwise I can't support it any more.I will see how it develops and depending on feedback, keep 2x / week or ultimately move to a different system.Your S3052 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4453162#post4453162 Thnaks.. understand it is difficult now that MtGox server was changed... and I just soptted one other thing.On the bitcoincharts.com chart section, I fail to be able to copy and save the images for my technical analysis. I can only post links, but that is suboptimal. Do you have the same issue?Thanks for taking care. The new site is great.Just one thing:The MtGox order book is reduced significantly. It seems the order depth has been reduced from full order book to only a fraction.Any idea why this is the case? that makes senseif bitcoin value does not increase mining will soon be in the red yes, it is 2-fold need to grow:1) more people acquiring bitcoins (traders, investors)2) more bitcoin based businesses +1This is absolutely true.The Bitcoin market needs more traders, investors or speculators. Otherwise prices will fall.Just think about that more than 10,000 bitcoins are generated daily. If miners cash out all or a proportion of it, the Bitcoin economy needs at least the same amount of new fund inflows and bitcoin buying to just keep prices flat (let alone rising).In the recent weeks, no significant new funds came in, and hence we are in a downtrend that may accelerate unless 0.95$, 1.0$ and 1.1$ will be broken to the upside.people holding bitcoins should better advertise it versus debating endlessly in this forum about minor things (and adding thousands of posts about issues that are beyond there circle of influence)This is not meant badly, just to put the "moose on the table". 
Not a bad idea,it just means for all participants that they trade with real money right away.Who would be interested to join? (I won't since I am analysing the market and issue technical analysis regularly) Thanks for sharing.I am using Elliott Wave personally a lot and it is one of my favorite and most successful one.On the Sp500, I believe that we are very very close to the top, if we have not seen it already. But even if we see one more high, it will be margnally above the 1344 point (maximum 1365). No, Jed should typically respond to you timely and then activate the transfer quickly. Agree.There is some misconception that MtGox is extremely dependent on LR, which is not the case.It is possible to do wire transfers (ACH in the US, standard bank wire (if you have a bank account in Europe, etc). All this works very well. Hi Everyone,not a lot of trading going on,  no changes to the outlook.Your S3052 Your proposal makes a lot of sense to me.10k of each currencyBTCUSD for sure as it is most liquid2 months or 3 monthsIdeally link it directly to MtGox order book or from MtGox indirectly via bitcoincharts.com (tcam)--> We need a prize for the winners, sth like 250 BTC (1.) 100 BTC (2.) 50 (3.), 10 (4.-15.)I am happy to join the people contributing. Great idea.I like it.We could write to them asking to add BTC into the Practice Account at least. Hi Everyone (and specifically those who are trading bitcoins),unfortunately trading has slowed down lately.At the same time, bitcoin trading remains one of the most profitable areas globally+ the compounded average monthly grwoth rate of BTC/USD is a whopping +70%+ BTC/USD are up + 31323% since May 2010.+ there is quite some volatility to use in tradingI am wondering whether we should not start a trading competition and award the best traders (the ones who make the  highest percentage gain in 1 month, 6 months, etc.)The only question remains how to track it and prove it for the participants, but with all the coding experts in the forum, this should not be a problem..? Analysis1. Longterm outlook:BTC/USD continues to be BULLISH longterm, as long as the 0.4-0.5 $  area holds (strong longterm horizontal and trendline resistance).2. Short term updateThe most probable scenario is a break above 0.95 $ as the kick off to a further BTC/USD rally.Short term, we see the following key levels:a) Resistance:* 0.95 $: Downsloping trendline from the 1.1 $ all-time-high.* 1.0 $: Round number resistance* 1.1 $: All time highb) Support*0.8 $: Strong support: 1) lower Bollinger band, 2) horizontal support.Next update: Friday, 4th.Your S3052 You should first learn about forextrading, start practising with tiny amounts, fail, try again, and perhaps after this "education period" you might make money consistently.be aware that this may last 5-10 years (or never) until you reach this expertise (you might be a magic talent, so I do not want to discourage you, but please be aware of the risks) 30 BTC sent Last update said: "The TREND is DOWN for BTC/USD towards 0.8$, and potentially deeper. (no change vs. last updates, the forecast is on track)"Prices indeed continued down and went down to 0.85 $. However, BTC/USD did not go down as deep as 0.8 $.Afterwards, prices caught a bid by one big 16k $ order and is now close to the upper trendline.If this trend (0.975 $) broken, a rise to 1.0 $ is likely.As said before, a strong rise above the 1.0 - 1.1 $ area brings the bull back into the lead. Next Full Update Wednesday, March 3rd.Your S3052 And again, it is Monday and I have reset the market sentiment poll.Up?Same as now?Down?I don't know?click on the poll abovePlease VOTE The TREND is DOWN for BTC/USD towards 0.8$, and potentially deeper. (no change vs. last updates, the forecast is on track)Only a strong rise above the 1.0 - 1.1 $ area brings the bull back into the lead. Your S3052 The terminology:"There is a strong likelyhood that we see another leg down toward 0.8 , or even 0.5 eventually." means that my forecast is BEARISH. PRICES are expected to go down to at least 0.8 $, based on my analysis.There is no ambiguity. Not everyone has to agree to that.I will be wrong if prices break 1 $ or 1.1 $. (Giving alternative scenarios at lower probabilities is also important in forecasting and technical analysis. It does not mean I am undecided). Thanks a lot+Emotionally, I wish bitcoins a huge success and further rising value... (but this is not about my emotions)Technically, it takes a rise above 1.0 $ ,and better 1.1 $ to continue and even  accelerate the rally. Vladimir, thanks for the question.Basically, a multitude of key technical indicators and tools point downwards (If I like this forecast or not, but it is my job to stick to the facts). To illustrate it better, I share another chart with more in depth analysis and some explaination.1. A new downtrend is established (lower highs) from the 1.1$ high (see upper green line)2. Volume trend is down: rises are accompanied with lower volume than declines3. MACD indicator is in bearish territory: blue line below pink line. As long as blue line does not cross pink line, we are in a downtrend.4. RSI is pointing downwards and has more room to sink before it gets oversold. When it hits 30, we may see a trend change.5. Uptrend line through the 0.3 - 0.4 -0.8 zones has been (slightly) broken to the downside: see second, lower green trendline.Net, not a lot to turn bullish now.Very longterm, the uptrend is intact as long as we remain above 0.5 $.Hope this explains better. Only a strong rise above the 1.0 - 1.1 $ area brings the bull back into the lead. Strong fund inflows are needed for that, which is always possible, given the huge awareness increase on bitcoins (as highlighted in other threads)Your S3052 great. I am on it now in Lausanne/Geneva. Stimmt, es ist wichtig dass jeder einzelne der so denkt wie wir weiter darauf beharrt, bitcoins nicht mit irgendwelchen zweifelhaften dingen in verbindung zu bringen - und anderen forumsmitglieder dazu ermuntert, dies auch nicht zu tun.cdecker und smoketoomuch: wir sind auf der gleichen wellenlänge.
Gute Idee,die zeigt dass es noch viel Potential im deutschsprachigen Raum gibt. Kriminelle Aktivitaeten sind immer schlecht und sollten verurteilt werden.Das hat aber nichts direkt mit der Natur von bitcoins zu tun, denn CASH wird genauso fuer kriminelle Aktivitaeten genutzt und wird nicht verboten. Not many lawyers working on Saturdays... sounds again shady Just one question for clarification:Is this stockmarket for investing bitcoins into bitcoin companies or/ and also for buying existing non- bitcoin related companies? Here a very brief Technical BTC Update.BTC/USD remain in a correction phase. While the short term head and shoulders bearish pattern has been invalidated with the break above 0.95 $, the intermediate correction isprobably  not over.There is a strong likelyhood that we see another leg down toward 0.8 , or even 0.5 eventually.Only a strong rise above the 1.0 - 1.1 $ area brings the bull back into the lead.Your S3052 I think this is also not perfectly accurate.In case the value of BTC fell lets say 70% (as it did in November), you can make a 70% profit with shorting, provided you buy back at that low value.Just keeping them would not help making this profit. me too.He did a great and especially brave job.He also gets my 30 BTC, despite the fact that he did notlink his outfit to the bitcoin idea.Please let me know the address.Still, my marketing experience tells me that next time, he needs more creativity about his look to create more awareness. I am happy to help planning the next event with a "concept" development and helping on preparing the plan. Apparently, there is a strong argument from MtGox (who, by the way, has played a significant role to drive thge bitcoin economy and idea).The argument is that there is some evidence that this guy is a scammer.Lets just wait for MtGox to work this out with baron. +1It seems very very likely that Baron is a scammer, and a smart one, trying to get people on the forum on his side.Whatever the objective of bitcoin is, it is not right to help scammers. +1Apparently, there was a big scammer stealing 45,000 if not more coins months ago.This should be properly investigated before returning the funds to this person. There is a great books called "market wizards".If you read some of it, you realize what is going on behind the scenes.And, you realize that it is probably only 1 in a 1000 to CONTINUOUSLY make profit (like Vladimir has mentioned above, there may be 20% who make some gains over 1-2 years, but then lose all again).Not to scare you, but in line with what others mentioned before, and in line with any other profession, you can only sustainably win if you are a damn expert.. so you need to study, learn, practice, fail, learn again more, practice..  Short BTC:Not currently possible automatically.You need to find someone who lends you BTC for a certain period of time, for a percentage fee.Then you sell the borrowed BTC on an exchange (ie MtGox)And after that you wait until prices dropped and repurchse the BTCFinally, you return the borrowed BTC to the lender.Watch out: If BTC prices rise, you make a loss.Short USD:Easier on typical western exchanges. You need to select the currency pair (i.e. USD/EUR, USD/JPY, etc.) and you find warrants, bear certificates, etc. to play either side.If you want to short USD vs. BTC, this is easy: It just means you buy BTC for dollars (if you have USD...)hope this helps a bit As promised, here is tonight's Technical BTC Update. working on it, but takes quite some effort and time... for sure, if someone sold 45,000 bitcoins in one go, this would be bearish for bitcoins Your comments make a lot of senseFrom a long term view,* Big support is 0.5* Strong resistance is 1.0 - 1.1 (all time high)  Let see what the current sentiment is:I have reset the poll again. So, folks, tell us what you think: Up, same or down?Please vote a simple explaination is that the person wanted to get the market price down without harming the overall sale (this is what you see in the average price of 0.72: this person has driven the market to 0.1 and still got an average price of 0.72 $these things are always happening in financial markets. big players = big banks do that all the time.I am not saying this is good, it's just reality. I could not agree more with you.I am not saying it will always go up. Only currnetly, the market has been going up in a stair-step pattern and there is not (yet) anny reason to declare a crash or bubble. As long as the longterm trend is up (trendline, see my chart analysis) the overall bitcoin market is in a strong uptrend.If this changes, it might crash.If the uptrend holds, then the underlying reason may be that bitcoin gets more wildly accepted which supports BTC/USD prices. As much as we all dream about ever rising bitcoin value, there is not a single financial or commodity or land or housing market that goes up in a straight line.And cuurently there may be some people interested to drive the bitcoin value down to be able to buy cheaper again.this could be the reason why someone crashes bitcoincentral bitcoin value to 0.1this can be done with minimal funds as the market is so illiquid.
I think it would be good for people trading bitcoins to study or at least inform themselves about how financial markets work before starting it or even wildly speculate about what is happening.For example, what is happening now is a normal correction that happens all the time in markets.standard corrections retrace between 38% and 62% of the recent advance.This means that retracements of 1.1-0.5=0.6 * 0.38 = 0.23 or 0.38 $results in either 0.87 $ (already exceeded) or 0.72 $.A larger retracement from the 0.17 bottom can lead to a correction down to 0.5all this is completely normal in financial markets and has nothing to do with bubbles or bubblegums ;-) todays update is very short since no change vs by special update from yesterdayThe correction is still underway Another leg down is likely towards 0.7, and possibly down yo 0.5$.Only a quick rise above 0.89 $ or better 1.0 $ can change this outlook. I reviewed the longterm charts and thought I should share this with you immediately.As mentioned in Friday's update, Bitcoin/USD have started a correction after breaking below the decisive 1$ mark as highlighted previously. The key question is how far could this correction go?To get a better picture, I reviewed the longterm chart, using logarithmic scale which is most appropriate for this strongly rising market.Key indicators continue to be strongly bearish: The MACD crossed downwards strongly for the first time in record, and Exponential Moving Average 13 has turned down.When drawing the already often shown and proven longterm trendline through the last significant lows, it is clear that there is potential downside towards 0.5 $.As long as prices do not break above  the downsloping EMA 13 (at 0.89 $), the downtrend is intact.A break above 1.0 $ enables a further rally to 1.1$ (all time high, and then higher towards 1.5$, 2$, etc.)chars here: http://mtgox.com/blog/?p=255Your S3052 About half of the community want to ban illegal activities, adult content or HYIPs.This should be enough for a decision to ban these. Even 30% voting for illegal activities to be banned is enough. Noone could ever want to have a thrid of the bitcoin community leaving beacuse of this.It even seems that some got so nervous and sold a lot of bitcoins over the past 24 hours. I think it's time to act.Who can finally decide and execute this ban? Sirius? The market sentiment poll is reset again.Up?Same as now?Down?I don't know?click on the poll abovePlease VOTE! This enriches and improves my BTC/USD forecasts and ultimately helps the community 1 agree that it should be manageable from a cost point.Still a visual link to bitcoin of the outfit is needed.What about a visualization of "bits" with (golden painted) 1's and 0's all over his body? Or black numbers on his bitcoin golden-bodypainted (half naked) body?OrPrinting a huge round bitcoin on cardbord?i pledge 30 btc to help Agree that underwear is not really the key point here.

Or as "digital wallet, or...Just a half naked guy will appear in the press as a non event or maximum as a crazy half naked guy.What we want out of this is that the press will write about bitcoins.just my tiny pearls of wisdom... It will be interesting to see how big this dark sell order at 1.0519 is (we will only know once it is cleared). Since Feb 15, it looks as if approximately 6000 BTC have been sold for this 1.0519 price.And to reiterate my opinion based on the technical analysis.THERE IS NO BUBBLE IMMINENT. +1let's at least ban things that are illegal in most regions (cp, heavy drugs, violence etc) +1it is needed to at least ban illegal stuff hereotherwise its bitcoin suicide at least midterm 1 Not a bitcoin article in the direct sense, but an article about mobile payments and digital wallets:http://www.marketwatch.com/story/visa-hopes-2011-will-see-shift-to-digital-wallet-2011-02-16?dist=bigcharts This is great stuff! By the way, I have made very good experiences with Paypal lately as well. Their customer service was immaculate. 1 Even if it may disappoint some of you, the forecast for silver is to go DOWN significantly over the next few years.First to 20 $ in the next 2-3 monthsThen to beow 10 $ in the next 2-4 years. not sure if the arguments support the call for a bubble.As with stocks, you can't buy anything with them and still people buy them when prices increase.The technical picture is very bullish, supported by the underlying volume. Currently, the probability for further rising prices is in my opinion higher. 1 **** Quick Alert ****BTC/USD Prices have again broken 1$ and the overall picture looks very bullish.We may be just ahead of another significant rally, now that parity is cleared again after some consolidation over the past few days.
Thanks for sharing!!!I am interested and would want a bit of more information about it. I will look at it next week (by coincidence I am experienced in presentations. I am actually training at the moment an "inspirational presenter" course to top management in madrid and will fly back tonight) http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4388081&posted=1#post4388081I also usually post here to spread the word in the financial community. thanks a  lot!! I am trying hard to keep this forecast accuracy for long time (while I am sure there will be a few times when I will be wrong as well) And again, it is Monday and I have reset the market sentiment poll.Up?Same as now?Down?I don't know?click on the poll abovePlease VOTE again! 1 Interesting, I am not aware of this Ponzi thing about Dinars. Based on Wikipedia, here are all the Dinar currencies: Algeria     Algerian dinar    DZD Bahrain    Bahraini dinar           BHD Iraq              Iraqi dinar              IQD Jordan    Jordanian dinar       JOD Kuwait    Kuwaiti dinar           KWD Libya              Libyan dinar             LYD Rep. of Macedonia    Macedonian denar    MKD Serbia    Serbian dinar            RSD Tunisia    Tunisian dinar            TND Great.I have it in my calendar. Interesting link.The Kuwaiti Dinar is the (nominally) strongest currency globally. This should be the goal for BTC to overcome (Kuwaiti Dinar is currently at 3.59 USD). Great foto!And by the way, my question on the meeting summary wasn't really serious. I'd have loved to join your beerfest!If anyone is close to the Lausanne / Geneva area, let me know. where is the meeting summary? ;-)I could not leave the lac leman area yesterday. Otherwise I would have joined. This is based on technical analysis of the dollar index (DXY)It already bottomed in 2008 and also made a mid term low in Nov '10, and is rallying since then.There is at least 20% upside from here. clear. BTC is not fiat, and will be stronger this depends largely on time horizon1. Over the next months (my estimate is 9-18 months) the USD will be one of the strongest globally (except BTC)2. After this strong USD rally, it will likely be what you outlined above: renminbi and CHF . I am less certain about JPY 1 Only when most people do NOT think it is a bubble, then prices may correct.This is the truth behind market sentiment.As long as so many people here write about bubbles, we are far from a (temporary) peak.Nothing in principle stops bitcoins to reach 1 $, 10$ 100 $ as long as we see this increasing fund inflow. Just my tiny pearls of wisdom. It would be good to get the exchanges to a level of other exchanges / bank accounts where you can trade.On most of the accounts, you get transaction numbers as one time codes for each transaction, on top of your normal username and password veryfication.establsihing those transaction numbers on bitcoin exchanges would make it much much more secure. That's life   1 Let see what the current sentiment is:I have reset the poll again. So, folks, tell us what you think: Up, same or down?

The most likely outlook from a charting view is a continued rally .once 0.5-0.51 is broken substantially to the upside, the rally may accelerate towards 1$ You can get some historical prices from yahoo finance:I.e for the DJI and for most other financial instruments. http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=%5EDJI+Historical+PricesI used to download this stuff in excel some years ago and built my own charts using excel. However, this is too tedious for me and since I have no clue about web design etc.. this does not make sense to me. Yes, exactly. This is what I had in mind.This would be neat, and I am not aware of a sizeable other index that outperformed bitcoins in the past 6-12 months. +1 This chart displays Gold / USD vs. EUR / USD as an example. If you replace EUR / USD with BTC/USD we would see that Bitcoins rise much more than even Gold in recent history. I posted this also in a new thread:In our efforts to grow the bitcoin idea, it would be useful to show laymen that Bitcoins are the best investment vs. most other financial instruments.To show that effectively, comparative charts of BTC / USD vs. Gold, Silver, DJI, other commodities would  be brilliant.Who has the technical capability to add this into some existing bitcoincharts sites?thanks for leting me know.I would like to add this perspective ideally regularly into my Bitcoin Analyses.

I would not be surprised if some hegdefunds would do that.Of course this is pure speculation, but you never know.Anyway this is a healthy rally. and I agree, it might be that some people wonder why they sold them at 0.48 or 0.50, etc. when prices are at 1$, 10$, 100$ per bitcoin (and vice versa as slush has written above) Bitcoins for Egypt!The new currency for the people .... But before they need to open up the Internet in Egypt again ( they shut it down a week ago for the public)!unbelievable. 1 questionWhy has there not been any trading since Jan 23? corrected.The link works now.And in the meanwhile, prices already fulfilled the shortterm forecast , reaching 0.445 1 1 I'd be considering becoming an investor.Also, I have experience in marketing if you need to grow / expand it in any point of time. Great. Do we have an update including January?

Unfortunately tomorrow is not possible.I rather need until next friday so it will be on time for next weeks edition. Iceland is one of the most modern countries ( according to google searches...)lets see if this is truebecause if so they should be open to modern (bit)coins Found some organizations in Iceland:Among the many social, professional, and service organizations in Iceland are the Chamber of Commerce, the YMCA and YWCA, the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, the Iceland Sport Association, the Federation of Icelandic Cooperative Societies, lodges of the Order of the Good Templar (temperance societies), Kiwanis, the Lion's Club, the Employers' Federation, the Association of Steam Trawler Owners, and the Union of Icelandic Fish Producers.Notable national youth organizations include the Federation of Young Progressives, Independence Party Youth Organization, National Council of Icelandic Youth, National Union of Icelandic Students, Social Democratic Youth Federation, Youth Movement of the People's Alliance, and The Icelandic Boy and Girl Scouts Association.Learned societies include the Icelandic Archaeological Society, the Icelandic Historical Society, the Icelandic Literary Society, the Music Society, the Icelandic Natural History Society, and the Agricultural Association. There are also the Icelandic Artists' Association, the Iceland Association of Pictorial Artists, the Icelandic Actors' Association, the Icelandic Musicians' Association, the Icelandic Composers' Society, the Icelandic Architects' Association, and the Icelandic Writers' Association. Among other cultural organizations are the Icelandic-American Society, the Danish Society, the Danish-Icelandic Society, the Anglo-Icelandic Society, the Alliance Française, the Nordic Society, and the Union of Women's Societies. +1 agreedand also agreed that we need to be 100% honest Fair point. I considered that and waited 3 days before publishing it (we are now 3 days above 0.4$, meaning that for sure one turn of the earth was covered).Closing prices are always difficult for currencies since they are traded 24/7. +1Why not trying with Bjork.  I have seen that as well. Sometimes one must have visions and I agree that this is a difficult one.That was also my point with saying that the Iceland inhabitants should get BTC in their hands (starting bottom up).This is a promising idea.The best would be to find a person in Iceland as Bitcoin ambassador who could do the local work. I am happy to join. Just let me know some details.I have some thoughts about what I could write.A thorough BTC market analysis where I will want to look more into the future on longterm trends and price directions, identifying the enxt major targets, supports and resistances (beyond parity, etc.). I always wanted to analyse this more in depth but I dont have the time and incentive to do that as this would cost me 4-8 hoursExpanding my analysis to the stock market, the dollar index, gold and silver (this I would do monthly)Covering some technical analysis education / training so that others can learn itOn top of that, we could also ask the readers what they WANT? This is a great idea overall.Also agree that this needs an elaborate strategy. A lot of the above is already going in the right direction.Another way to establishing BTC would be to get Iceland people invest into BTC's and accumulate them, i.e. via i) getting an Iceland bank / fund investing into BTC's or get BTC listed on the exchange itself Seriously, if only about 100,000 (30% of the 320,000 population) Iceland people invest 100 $ into BTC, this would mean 10,000,000 $. With that, Iceland would already be the major BTC stakeholder (holding 80% of BTC economy, of course only if all other variables stay unchanged). This would also increase the wealth of Iceland people and the entire country massively since BTC/USD would rise at least 5 fold.At the same time, businesses accepting BTC in Iceland would flourish.For perspectve: A mini research on exchanges in Iceland revealed:A wide variety of firms are currently listed on the exchange, including firms in retail, fishing, transportation, banks, insurance and numerous other areas. Because of the small size of the Icelandic economy and the low cost of public listing, many of the companies traded on the ICEX are relatively small and are relatively illiquid.All domestic trading of Icelandic bonds, equities and mutual funds takes place on the ICEX. Bonds and equities are regularly traded, though the liquidity is small in comparison with other exchanges. No mutual funds are currently listed on the market.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland_Stock_Exchangehttp://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:OMXI15.jpg&filetimestamp=20090506213925 New all time closing high at MtGox. http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#tgCzm1g10zm2g25 Here two links about sentiment and also about the current Elliott Wave forecast that includes an outlook for Gold as well.1. The 10 page report is free. You only need to register on the site (also for free)http://www.elliottwave.com/club/Safeguard-Your-Financial-Future/default.aspx?code=422552. http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article25782.html see text without charts (for charts, click on the link):"Over a month ago I began to issue a warning to traders and investors who were long precious metals that a possible correction was likely. Prices were overextended and nearly every 5 minutes a gold investment advertisement was appearing on my television. Additionally gold advertisements could be heard during commercial breaks of many right leaning radio talk show hosts, not that I listen to them or anything.This article is not about pounding my chest, it is about a learning process that many investors fail to take the time to learn. It is easy to grandstand and speak in analogies when discussing the financial markets, but in the end the name of the game is to buy low and sell high or sell high and buy low depending on which direction a trader expects an underlying to move. I believed gold was overbought several weeks ago and while my timing was not precise, the eventual price action has followed my thought process.The single greatest threat to profitability for investors and traders is getting caught up in the financial media and punditry. I try to stay away from the financial media at all costs as I do not want my view of the financial markets blurred or altered by the commentary of a so-called expert that I am not familiar with at all. About the time when I was calling for a correction in gold, the financial media was putting out tremendous bullish hype regarding gold and I'm guessing television channels like CNBC had commentators declaring their love and long term desire to own gold in their portfolio.This is not to say that gold will not work higher in the future. In fact, research from fundamental and technical analysts suggests that gold prices could continue going higher for several years as the United States continues to devalue our currency while running massive budget deficits. No one really knows for sure what will eventually happen, but it would not be shocking to see gold continue to rally in the future. However, the shiny metal needs to wash out some weak owners by moving lower and working off long term overbought conditions before making a run at breaking out to new highs." i should share some compelling statistics and charts to illustrate itThe short answer is:not all are already believing in a downtrend of goldit was 98% bullish sentiment in decembernow it is somewhere around 90%major bottoms occur when bullish sentiment is below 10%This means there is a LOT of room on the downside before we get there typically you dont have enough funds to stem the selling once it has begun.Gold has topped out and will decline much more before bottoming, unless you can invest billionsThe big players including hedge funds have started to sell and/ or playing the short side I think we are overall on the same page.Summarizing what has been said here would look as follows:1. Whenever there are no longterm price histories (which applies for bitcoins), all barriers are at first only psychological. This is particularly true at new all time highs, because there is no former top.2. Once prices corrected from a previous top, on top of that psychological barrier, a more technical barrier forms. The strength of this barrier depends on many factors. One of them is the volume pattern.Example:If a lot of volume is traded at a certain price range, then this barrier becomes strong resistance or support. This is what happened in the 0.3 - 0.35 area. A lot of people bought and sold in this range at the November peak. And, a lot of sell orders were placed again in December in this area. Hence, it took quite some time to clear this level again.In contrast, the 0.4 level was cleared much faster, because there was not a lot of trading in this price range around the November peak.Even less volume was traded around 0.5. This is why this level could be a smaller barrier.At the same time, this is pure speculation. You can also make the case that 0.5 is a "nicer" and "rounder" number than 0.3 and 0.4 and many people want to sell in this range.We will see what happens. The market will tell us and we will stay close to it. This is a valid question, indeed - and probably everyone investing and trading has those questions in his mind all the time...Everyone may have his own method to answer it.I can only share my personal method, which uses technical analysis and which has guided me for years successfully.Based on the current price pattern, sentiment indicators, etc. we will likely see a deep correction that may end in the 1050 - 600 area. I know this is broad, but I will give a better update once prices get closer to 1100-1000. We need to see the full picture then to determine whether prices fall further or build a bottom then and rise.One good indicator is the "contrary sentiment" method: If most people believe prices will go down, we are close to the bottom. If most people believe prices will go up, we are close to the top.For perspective: Around the 1400 $ topping area, the percentage of people believing in further rising prices was a whopping 98%. This means that they were probably all already invested and maximum 2% were left who could still buy (but this is not enough to further propel prices upwards). This is a classic example of a top. Then prices are falling and people invent multiple hypothesis why this happens...Often it is a simple as looking at the title page of the new york times: If it says "gold will rise to 5000$" it's a good time to sell (with some time leeway +- a couple of weeks)To come back to your question when to buy gold. My personal strategy is to buy physical gold (no paper gold) in the 800-1100 area, and accept a dip to the 600 $ area (if it happens I will buy more).I expect prices to rally significantly against the dollar in the next 3-5 years (while first undergoing a big correction as mentioned above) +1EMH does not help at all to base meaningful financial decisions upon. >kibathat's fine.I was actually thinking about a more comprehensive overall market review, but i do not want to push anything if it does not appeal to folks Fully agree. My point is more that the 0.5 mark is ONLY psychological and not supported by strong market technicals. The 0.3-0.35 barrier was much much stronger. Another, perhaps wild idea: If we could convince a whole technology/software/hardware,etc. company (at least midsize) to do mining with their employee computers in non-working hours, this could also strengthen the network.And on top, create some PR... The rally is continuing.As a side note, I am just wondering, who is the one selling 20,000 BTC at 0.51 in the order book?At least from a market analysis standpoint, this does not make sense at all. 0.5 is really not a strong barrier. It's purely psychological.The only fundamental reason could be that this person needs the money quickly.(and now I stop speculating about this .. but I am just curious about that to be honest)
It is still disappointing to only see 4! nodes in Japan.Japanese people could be very much attracted by bitcoin, particularly investors, who don't see strong stock market devleopments in their domestic market.It seems not a lot of trading os going on on JPY/BTC neither.Who has Japanese friends / colleagues? I am happy to write one if you give me some time next week. More seriously, I'd prefer Ireland  :-) Let's get going. Anyone from Zimbabwe here?Anyone having some contacts? thanks.left you a PM ok done.Do I read it correctly, that the Gold spot price bids are referring to the price on Jan 30, 0:00 ?thanks for confirming That is an interesting viewpoint, and actually quite possible.To start this, one would need to find one jurisdiction that would be the "low hanging fruit" - one that is most ready to accept bitcoins as national currency.who could this be? This is great.I could not find the bets on gold and oil prices. Where can they be found? then the barrier at 0.5-0.51 would be broken and prices ready to attack 1.0-1.3 they did the same to me 3 days agoWe should boycott them ********Alert*********the market has spoken and decided that the rally goes on and is acceleratingPrices respected the trendline and has broken out to the upsideFurther upside surprises likelyParity by end January still possible at least in the short rum (6-18 months timeframe), dollar will go up significantly (20%+)gold will go down (-20 to -40%) 1 on their website, they already say "Wir referenzieren Rheingold <=> Bitcoin im Verhältnis 1:1.", which means that it is pegged to the fixed ratio 1:1 (if my German is not wrong) This whole Timecoin thing does not at all speak to me.In my opinion, this is a waste of time (Wastecoin) :-) Just a quick update (as family member just got sick, I am hoping to give a full update Wednesday)I want at least to give a brief update: Prices are correcting at the moment. Support should be in the 0.28-0.30 $ area. Agree with you. You may be forced to pay damage fees bo PayPal if they enforce it. Thanks for the donation of one of you!And secondly, the poll is reset so you can vote again freshly on "What do you expect BTC/USD prices to do in the next 4 weeks?" See poll on the top of this thread. 1 I lowered the prices for the Ascension Stamp Collection. Hoping that someone likes my lonely, but beautiful fish on the stamps. I brought them personally from Ascension Island.http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=85&mode=1
exactly, most of the times, people call the top way too early.this also applies for insiders of companies what you say is pure speculation.how do you know when to define it as a bubble?we may talk about a bubble when BTC/USD is at current value, at 100$, at 10,000$, etc.currently, there is no technical evidence for a bubble Yes, we are in an acceleration phase of a big , high volume rally.At this stage, selling is not really needed from a technical perspective (unless people really need cash or need to buy sth with bitcoins in the short term) 1 and not to forget, I put the rare ascension island stamp set  on biddingpond.com  Agree to Bruce and many others.I think we all could re-focus on other cool and promising projects and just take this character.. and move on..I also like the fun behind creativity and discussion, but after a couiple of weeks, we should be able to lock this and move on (just my personal POV, feel free to continue debating as this is an open forum) 1 just to clarify one thing and secondly comment on dark pools1) my relationship to mtgox and all the other exchanges is the same as for everyone else.I dont see any completely dark pool order.2) overall, it does not make any difference to the market no matter if you have dark pools , semidark pools or none.there are already enough traders and professional-enough investors participating in the BTC market who know what's going in the market.they can " test the water" and find out if there is resistance via a dark sell orderor support by a dark buy order or not.in the end it does not matter. +1 !!!Keep it up. 1 Bruce Wagner is behind BitcoinMe Great map.and also great to see our red wine cake there. I am anxiuosly waiting for the first oder (just practised the baking again last week and it tasted superb!) ... Unless all people at the same time move their ASK orders up to that level at the same time Me too in Lausanne/Geneve (German or French) but anyhow the key people in the target audience speak English here as well.Maybe this is the start of the Bruce Wagner Europe Tour 2011 (sorry Bruce it's just too funny to creatively brainstorm on this. I'll stop anytime) Maybe we should instead fund the real, one-and-only Bruce a flight ticket from NY to London.Or to Paris, Berlin, Madrid, Rome, Athens, etc together with a corresponding language course? I was specifically referring to bitcoinmarket.com price developments.When clicking on the link I shared last night, (again posted below), you will realize that the all time high on bitcoinmarket.com was not 0.5 but 0.35.http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bcmPPUSD#vzcvztgSzm1g10zm2g25To be 100% honest, the 0.50 high on MtGox was in my experience a "fake high" as 1 or max 2 traders pushed it up with ridiculously low volumes.That's why I always look at the bigger picture including other exchanges. In this case, I strongly believe that the 0.35 $ high is more important that the 0.50 $ high on MtGox.The consequence would be that once 0.35 $ will be cleared, the market could easily break 0.50 $ in some point. My view is confirmed if you look into the order book at all exchanges which is very thin beyond 0.35$.http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/mtgoxUSD.html This is my spouse and I can assure you she turns you from a "couch-potato" shaped girl or guy into a fit and healthy person - if you or your spouses invest the required discipline.More details coming soon. Great question, but to be honest, I am a non-IT person, so it would even be difficult for me to understand what unicode exactly is..If not feasible, discard my idea. Exactly, we are saying the same thing.Advertising here in the forum is cool. And advertising outside - if done properly - can enable bitcoin to go through the roof. 1
It works for me, though. Maybe its your browser? You can buy LibertyReserve with Paypal after some registration at exchangezone.comAnd then buy bitcoins with Libertyreserve. Agree with you on the fall of the monetary system and the war risks.However, for Gold prices in USD, the current sentiment is typical for PEAKS, not for BOTTOMS.Gold has turned down and will undergo a major correction (targets 1150, 1050, and possibly down to 850), before the rally continues. Same for silver, copper, platinum, most commodities.This will likely last months if not a couple of years before the fall of the monetary system will cause Gold to rally sharlply again, above 5000, etc. and Bitcoins as well... just an idea that I'd like to share:We could create a pitch for creative agencies to create this symbol.The benefit for an agency would be that they could be the first and one and only creator of this symbol for this groundbreaking digital invention. Having worked with many agencies in the past years  I sense that some of them may be very excited because it would create buzz for them.they would likely issue a press release.The benefit for bitcoin would be that we would profit from this buzz and dont need to pay anything (while we can still donate them some coins) as a client, we could still chose whichever symbol we want from the agencys proposals. You probably need to advertise outside of this forum to generate more trades as otherwise you are cannibalizing the other existing exchanges.Don't get me wrong. It is great to have your service, but it is crucial to grow the bitcoin pie foremost vs. fighting on market shares. at least in Europe there is a very easy way for newcomers to buy bitcoins:Euro bank wire to MtGox or bitcoin-central.it can't get much easier ( its actually easier and faster vs. Opening up an account ( depot) for trading stocks   in Europe. indeed. Although I personally don't like the hooker business, it will probably be an area for bitcoins.People could even pay them right before the "service " once a mobile bitcoin application works. wow. this gets traction.On the cooking / food offers, perhaps one could develop a map where each of us can enter the location and the food offers..Vinnie, perhaps you have guests in Poland earlier than you think.. LOVE IT :-)I'd buy bitsleep in bulk. To offer more diversification and also a chance to get a great cake in Swiss Romande (Geneva area in Swizterland), I offer a great RED WINE CAKEhttp://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/423984311496/Rotweinkuchen.htmlthat my wife has been doing with great success for the last 10 years for many birthdays. We shall bake this for 250 BTC.It will feature a strong red wine as ingredient and delicious chocolate pieces.The cake is to be ordered 2 days in advance and will be available in Geneva area. Certainly. Let me quickly respond, giving you a couple of links.1) For an overview of almost all common technical analysis methods, I recommend the book:Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets: A Comprehensive Guide to Trading Methods and Applications (New York Institute of Finance) http://www.amazon.com/Technical-Analysis-Financial-Markets-Comprehensive/dp/0735200661/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1294141681&sr=1-1When you search more about technical analysis on google, I am sure you find more.i.e.http://www.investopedia.com/university/technical/2) For Elliott Wave analysis, see elliottwave.comI recommend the book:http://www.elliottwave.com/books/ewp/default.aspx?code=WPMS&articleid=0In one of my next analysis , I will try to explain a bit more. At the same time, please recognize that I do this on top of a 12h / 5d job for free (except some donations). Although I would like to do more, I physically can't do it unless someone enables me to not need sleep any more... Agree on zero hedge.Sorry if I missed this before in another thread, but:Did someone already try to get ZeroHedge accepting BTC donations? you're back..?!Great that you are back.were you stuck in a pile of bitcoin wallets that rained on you (just a joke...) that's why I said "over to each of (or some of) the attendants", so that we could cap it.Anyway, it was more of a brainstorming anyway. Still, we may want to do this in a limited fashion"the first 100 get the USB stick with bitcoins in a wallet "the USBitwallet", or we can create a raffle that a few of the attendants can win lets say 10 USB sticks with 50, 45, ... 5 bitcoins in it.My experience says that if you give people something real into their hads, they are more easily convinced. good idea.. and hand over to each of (or some of) the attandants 1 bitcoin in a wallet on a USB stick so that they can get started and will talk about it when they are inside the Fest  It all depends on the target audience, the number of them, and the potential adoption rate we can get from that.The rate of return (ROI) may be high or low, depending on those factors. 1000 $ can be worth it if the above factors will be promising enough. I think your video is overall quite good, it;s going into the right direction.Make sure you don't get discouraged by all the criticism, and keep going.By the way, all the criticism is intended to be positive for making the videos more robust.One comment from my side is that for the Bitcoin part, it would be great to avoid cartoons, but have someone real talking (in an interview style). I think cartoons are not helping the bitcoin credibility. Cartoon = funny, bitcoin = serious! For your info:I am also active on forexfactory http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4280291#post4280291and we got an interesting comment from one member:http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4280020&postcount=58 Welcome in an exciting year for Bitcoins. I wish you a great, happy and healthy year 2011.Tonight I want to particularly thank tcatm for the great charting website, which enabled a true stepchange in BTC market analysis and I am sure you all use and tell your friends who are interested to follow BTCs.http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/Now to tonight's Technical BTC Update, the first in 2011 (charts can be found here: http://mtgox.com/blog/?p=153).Our forecast remains fully on track . The trend is UP since the Dec 7 low. Prices have strongly moved higher on rising volume and hit 0.30 $ (up more than 600% over the past 5 months).Only if the big support around 0.17-0.20 is breached again materially, further declines are possible towards 0.1 - 0.14 $.Otherwise the longterm rally is intact.Analysis1. Long term outlookWe are in an almost textbook-type rally. Prices are on their way towards 0.35 $ (stronger resistance) and then 0.50 $ (all time high, very weak resistance as trading volume at the peak was negligable, see Nov 7 peak chart, 2nd chart in this post). Upside almost seems unlimited if markets continue to be that strong and further funds will be inflowing. I will update on price targets when we get beyond the 0.50 $ high. We are currently in a third of a third wave up which typically surprise on the upside, and in turn it is dangerous to bet on the downside.2. Short term updateForecast also fully on track on a short term basis. Upper short term resistance of 0.25-0.26 has just been cleared. The dark pool ASK at 0.25 has been evaporated. Prices will likely move towards 0.35 once psychological resistance at 0.30 $ is taken out. Expect this resistance to be minor.Next regular update Wednesday, Jan 5th.Your S3052 Signed up as well.
+1 Agree 100% To your questions:1) Bigger players are investors / speculators who invest more than 10k USD into bitcoins. I know a few of them personally who are actively considering doing that (I will never be able to guarantee what they do, but they are serious). Some people like them can easily pump in >100 k USD if they want. If you think about just a few of them entering, the market will already rise a lot. If hundreds of them enter.. you can imagine more.2) 100x seems illusionary, but in reality that is not impossible even in the near term. Two examples: a) Amazon started trading at the NASDAQ in May 1997 at 2.4 $. In May 1999 they were at 110$ (up 45x, and don't forget that here we are talking huge market cap, 50 Billion $ at the 110$ high.) b) Bitcoins increased from 0.003 in May 2010 (see bitcoinmarket) to 0.3 in November 2010, an increase of 100x in 6 months. BTC has done it already. Doing it again is not out of question.And finally, it is good that some of you don't believe that this happens, because based on sentiment analysis, this means that we are not yet anywhere close to the peak. Only if more than 95% of folks believe that it can't go higher are we close to a high. now we talk seriously, finally...At least within europe, MtGox now represents a truly big and easy to handle exchange, similar to normal ways tk trade stocks, etfs, funds, etc.If some bigger players enter the market, we can easily see 10x, 100x fold increases in bitcoin value, as there is not much required to move the market substantially.Some folks selling currently between 0.3 and 0.35 might regret it. No, you are not. You just focus on what is really important and fun at the same time :-) This is great and will likely mark the start of yet another BITCOIN RALLY phase.It may take up to mid/end next week until transfers are on MtGox, but then... a potential rally is on the horizon. Servus!Du gehoerst natuerlich zu uns! Wo kommst du denn her in Oesterreich? Ich bin aus Deutschland lebe aber in der Schweiz bei Lausanne. 1 I have to say I need to learn Russian... I am so curious what you are writing in Russian here. Are you doing bitcoin advertising on Google? I like your goal to market bitcoins in the right way.It should be a good balance of emotional and rational points, but I agree the emotional aspect is critically important at the first contact. You may be able to contact Bethel or Valerius here in the forum (perhaps they sell bulk). guys this is a complete misunderstanding.What I mean is that we could all try to spread the word about the greatness of bitcoin to intelligent women we know.Women are often great in business and often even superior to men when it comes to financials, trading etc.I am sure bitcoin will be interesting to those women.If some women get to use it, we have 50% growth potential for bitcoins. Coming back to the women topic...We could reward the man who brings in the first ACTIVE bitcoin woman (not just his girlfriend, or wife, etc.) but one who is really contribution in the forum.I pledge 3 BTC. That's a good question about the miners.. I would love to understand this as well. BTC/USD has just cleared the 0.25 resistance and moved to 0.26 $ on relatively strong volume.RALLY seems to continue...Seems like the dark pool ASK order on MtGox has been bought fully. thanks! what is RT? So far I have completed to the satisfaction of the customer:>>> NOK/EUR analysis for sturle (Norwegian crown vs. Euro)Currently, I am in the process of doing a Platinum analysis 1 In my personal point of view, this would be fantastic becuase it is generally about INNOVATION (like you stated in areas like: The documentary is about Atmospheric Water and low tech water collection devices for the future, Hydroponic and Vertical Farming, Grassroots Financial Systems, Homemade energy, Overpopulation Myths, Grassroots Viral MediaI, Industrial Hemp and Mass Apathy.)It is actually needed that bitcoin awareness and publicity moves to higher level, so this is spot on. I disagree.We are still overall in a deflation that will accelerate again and will be persistent for some time until inflation kicks in again.What you see in some mainstream financial coverage is the masking of the deflation becuase noone wants to face reality.The best way to look at it is to view the Dow Jones / Gold ratio. Then you see that deflation is in full force still, and will further accelerate.
you want to own PHYSICAL gold, definitely no paper because this will be worthlesshave a look at http://www.safewealthgroup.com/(you need to send them a mail to get access, but it is for free. they don't offer a real website for good reason)they have a great clarity about that and great reputationthey now offer "safestore" for gold, silver and cash notes 1 or...we establish a killer app where women can buy the best and most expensive SHOES with bitcoins +1 Agree with 1 caveat.The ratio can stay unchanged at a high level even if both go down.As there are big speculators in the gold market on top of longterm investors, if the crisis gets worse (which I believe it will), Gold will also go down as hedge funds need to unload gold to pay out fund withdrawals and stay liquid.Hence, Gold is likely to go down towards 1000 and possibly towards 650-850 by 2011/12 before sharlpy turning up and making new highs. For your info:There seems to be a dark pool ASK order at MtGox around 0.25, which means for those folks who want to buy for 0.25 $, it is possible. This may be even faster than many expect here.I predict this happens by Jan 31, 2011. 1 Gold is on its way down from 1430 $ towards at least 1150, and then potentially further into the 650-800 $ area.This is based on my technical analysis.However, the dollar will strengthen at the same time, hence, I'd not recommend to sell physical gold and move into other risky assets.If one wants to trade the gold decline, better use futures and keep your physical gold.... and I forgot,.. trading gold into butcoins is the only trade that may be the exceptions.. as bitcoins may be getting even more stable and stronger vs. everything on earth   please don't forget to vote on the sentiment question.thanks 1 2.25 2.23 2.23 wow, it seems if this is getting goin the BTC exchange rate is likely to go up (as predicted anyway from a technical standpoint)But now fundamentals support it.. so if someone is running the client in a location, what does the color show if:* the client is running with "generate" turned off?* the client is running with "generate" turned on?* the client is NOT running at all? sorry, I am a newbee when it comes to understanding nodes and these kind of things.can you explain what untested nodes means for a layman?thanks so much! what are the white markers? 2.2 btc for 1 share and I am only 2h away (close to Lausanne)
Brief update as I am travelling:RALLY is on track. Next target 0.28-0.29 $.More to come latest Sunday. there was something discussed  on:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1861.0that may be related to this 1 1201 1 651 :-) Freddy. Now we are talking.Let's forget about all those debates and bring bitcoin forward.The time spent on this debate thread could have been invested in spreading / driving / promoting bitcoins. yes, depending onthe exchange rate. You should ask mtgox directly about the details great work. Send you some coins.By the way, if you want to buy bitcoins via Euros, you can do it on MtGox (see add funds right on the bottom of the page) It is true that the system is not ideal yet.At the same time, there are very good ways to buy bitcoins. I.e. If you are in the US, you can go via bitcoingateway.com (yes, you need to get registarted confirming your credit card, but once it is done you never have to do it again.You can also buy bitcoins via MtGox if you are in Europe via EUR bank wire.Sometimes it is worth to surpass some initial barrier before you get a benfit of something really great. You should 1) download the bitcoin software then 2) buy some coins to get familiar with it.Just do it, do it now,... it's fun and potentiall set's you up for a wealthy future. Agree Bruce.This is not necessarily negative, as long as we use the momentum behind that in a positive way - and stay out of the direct conncetion to wikileaks.We should stay distinctively distant from wikileaks, meaning: We should not push wikileaks to accept donations in bitcoins at all. 501 1 210 200 it would not help wikileaks nor bitcoin if wikileaks would accept bitcoin now.as I think the people in wikileaks are smart I don't think they will do it.The art has begun now to turn this new bitcoin publicity into positive and legitimate activities, ideally even stating that bitcoin does not want to be assiciated with wikileaks af this stage (like satoshi has expressed clearly ) we could add a statement on the homepage of bitcoin.org. while I can't speak for MtGox personally, he confirmed me that his situation is very solid. I am away from my computer  and will not be able to issue tonights update in full.I will make up for that tomorrow.In short, the upside discussed Wednesday has not yet materialized, because the consolidation continued .at the same time , selling volume is low which shows some bullish divergence.if some serious buyers step in, the upside can materialize quickly. This is a very valid assumptionEven if some people may not believe into it, but this is exacly what happened over the past 4 months where BTC/USD increased from 0.01 to now 0.20 (almost 2000%)The BTC/USD ratio was even lower at the start of trading at bitcoinmarket with 0.001, meaning we now have a 20,000 % increase.This has not really been driven by so many businesses accepting bitcoins, but mostly behind people wanting to BUY bitcoins and keep them in their wallet.
Agree that options would be a great enabler for more trading. it is very simpleLike for buying any stock on a stockexchange, you can buy and sell bitcoins on bitcoin exchanges .Then what you want is "buy low sell high"Bitcoin is still in its infancy, chances are that longterm prices can rise significantly. It could be like apple when they were at 2 dollars...Of course, there are always risk for declines, in the end it is you to decide. That would be great if you can connect with them.There exists the possibility on btcex.com to trade JPY/BTC already, and either the Japanese can do it that way or they set up their own exchange, which is maybe  a better way to get funds in. True , but creditcards are accepted for US people only on bitcoingateway (which is great, but it should be global)We should also make a pitch to get some Asian folks in. I am sure they are also interested in investing.Maybe we can reach out to some Asian forums? Anyone who has some contacts? 2 questions, pleaseHow do you promote this in Asia? Offering JPY is fantastic but I do not see big volumes.Overall, are the volume displayed on bitcoincharts.com correct? I see volumes mostly below 10 bitcoins which seems weird.thanks! No one interested  Are most people here busy with fighting Goliath's like paypal, mastercard, etc. vs. trying to grow bitcoins?What about a tell-a-friend initiative?If you convince a friend / colleague to buy bitcoins, you will get a special bonus? it only takes about 30,000 $ to ignite the next bitcoin rally. That means for example 30 people buying bitcoins for 1,000$ globally... Not a lot.Why am I saying this?because it is indispensible for the bitcoin economy that prices rise.as someone else has stated yesterday in the forum:unless the value of bitcoins rises significantly there is a viciuos circle :not enough businesses accepting them, because too few customers having bitcoinsnot enough customers buying bitcoins as not enough things to do with them 1 +1 I am also in for the right business plan and purpose, staying as legitimate as possible. http://mtgox.com/blog/?p=92Here is tonights update. Exaclty. This Elloitt wave principle, coupled with other technical analysis and sentiment measures proved to be successful for me over the past decade, in all the bull and bear markets. This is good.Should we make a concept test to see whether an alternative advertising works even better?What about:"Bitcoin - the best electronic payment"Find out yourself: Click here. Mtgox comment came while the price has also reached 0.185, so no, it is not related to his comment.It's just a logical consequences of less buying volume than selling volume. Unless this changes prices will not rally. And secondly, the market technicals (price direction, volume trends, technical indicators) are quite bearish. In those cases, traders and investors are typically not recommended to "cathc the falling knife".This condition can persist quite some time, without finding fundamental reasons for it. It's herding....Lastly, sentiment is still too bullish for a persistent rally, most people in this forum "talk the market up" which is not a good sign. (recall how people said at prices reaching 0.1 $ that the rally from 0.06 is too steep.. prices rallied much more (+500%) before reversing. I'll join in Switzerland Typically in the technical analysis, "technically worse" means bearish and "technically better" means bullish. But I agree it can be misleading. Because for short sellers, DOWN means it is positive for them.But I have corrected my wording to make sure it gets even more unbiased. break down below 0.20, currently at 0.185 $.It is quite probable that we are in a sell off towards 0.10-0.11 $.Sentiment is highly bullish which is a contrary indicator, confirming the direction is DOWN.This development again confirms that investors should never become complacent and ignore that both , huge rallies and also crash type declines are always possible, with all investment vihicles, including bitcoins.Full analysis tonight. I also think a deadsite switch system is deperately needed to enable bitcoin communicty growth.I know a couple of people personally who would like to buy bitcoins but are afraid that they lose all in case of a shutdown.I'll pledge 50 BTC for someone who could enable a working deadsite switch system for mayor excchanges including MtGox, etc.. fantastic! yeah* bitcoin cuff links* bitcoin ear ringsExciting! Yes, go to the facebook link Bruce posted above
On the question about counter measures:How would the customer funds be safe if someone would shut down the exchange websites?Are the funds ( BTC and / or USD ) be protected and can be retrieved or are they gone? Idea:We can use the current scepticism about PayPal to direct people to BITCOIN. With ten thousands of people closing their paypal account over the past hours, there is big potential for a great alternative: Bitcoin (and the good thing is that we do not necessarily link this directly to wikileaks, we can just piggyback on the rejection of paypal).WHAT to communicate: " STOP using PAYPAL, START using BITCOIN"  or simpler " STOP PAYPAL, START BITCOIN"HOW?1. Create a new facebook page " STOP PAYPAL, START BITCOIN"2. Promote this from various other sites, pages, forums, i.e. building on what Bruce commented on yesterday.\If we use this huge momentum, we can create massive awareness with very low investment.. just a bit of time of each of us..What think?Bruce, can you create this facebook site, since you have already stared on this idea? " STOP PAYPAL, START BITCOIN"N.B> perhaps we can go even further as a second step and say " STOP EBAY, START BIDDINGPOND", but we should wait until BITCOIN awareness and adoption is bigger, because currently biddingpond is too small. very well explained+1 das wuerd ich auch gerne wissen, kann aber auch nicht helfen.vielleicht mal eine mail an paypal deutschland schreiben The technical situation is getting more bearish.MACD and RSI point downwards (see attached charts)There is still a risk for a deep sell-off towards 0.11-0.14 $. +1great ideaI want to buy one of these the more of this dubiouss and even illegal ideas float around in this forum the sooner it will be just called illegal by governments and then the party is over.I don't think most people here want that. But fine, if a handful of people want to destroy the work Satoshi has started more than 1.5 years ago and hundreds of people here have developed further, even try to make a living from Bitcoins, that's probably unavoidable (as noone can rule anything here behind the decentralization) There is nothing wrong with revealing the truth (i.e. from Wikileaks. In this respect, I like a lot the concept behind Wikileaks).All I am saying is that it is suicide for bitcoins to connect with Wikileaks today, where many big powers are against.The time is not ripe yet.It's like a runner who wants to run a marathon. He better trains a bit before trying. That is exactly the issue.I am so worried about the intent behind this wikileaks thread that, if i could, would only want to have "legallysafe" bitcoins in my wallet that are not connected to wikileaks or any other illegal matter.those who want to play this aggressive game against governments can do it, but i dont want to be connected to that. worst case for me would be that bitcoin businesses would be forbidden .Even if this would be wrong this would be the end of making bitcoins what most of us want.then there will only be a handful of davids left but overall bitcoins would be forgotten soon exactly this is both, a great benefit and also a great danger .in the wikileaks case its a great danger.As this is an open and free forum, I can at least voice my concerns as much as what's going on with wikileaks is not right,do we really think it makes sense to push bitcoins into wikileaks is making sense in the current environment?i am scared that this poses a big risk for bitcoins to consciously go against too many and too big enemiesIt would potentially be much better to first make bitcoinbe far more widespread and accepted in a safe way vs going against the big ones already now tonights update is very brief for two reasons:first, I don't feel well and second, more importantly, because prices are still rangebound.Unless buying volume rises massively, BTC/USD remains stuck between 0.24and 0.28.it requires approx. 30,000 $ to take out resistance between 0.28 and 0.35/0.40.who dares to add funds and buy??? I like ⓑ a lot. I restarted the poll again to determine the "BITinvestor" sentiment again.So please vote again! http://mtgox.com/blog/?p=78Here is the new update. I also comment on an alternative scenario. People probably are not enagaged enough. As a consequence, they will have forgotten "when it is time". Don't assume that people remember it (like me and you). The average person will have missed it.We would miss the objective of advertising if we do not achieve at least a significantly higher click rate. I agree with you that awareness is also one objective, but I doubt that people recall that they have seen it (we could prove/disprove this via a survey among those who have been on those pages .. but it's probably too much effort) Thats good data. BAsed on the low click rate, we may want to revise the design of the banner.We need to make it more disruptive /distinctive and potentially also give the viewers a better reason to click (i.e. visual invitation to "click here" to "gain / get XYZ").People need to more esily grasp "what's really in for me". If we don't offer a convincing benefit, it does not move the needle enough.. and obviously we can do better,..MARKETERS/CREATIVE AGENCIES... where are you here in this forum ?? Why was the site down? I agree with you, teppy. Chaord is a great guy, I have talked to him via the phone already and worked on a joint project charter. I full trust him.
are you referring to those bitcoins that you colelcted for the CCC donation? how many BTC do we plan to donate? There is not a lot to add to the midday update (but I would feel bad if I did not issue the promised update in the evening as usual. So that's why here are some fresh comments):Trend is DOWN.Short term target of approx 0.2 has been almost reached (0.215 today) and prices bounced off from there. This evening prices then continued to decline (currently 0.236, down -13% for the day).We have always highlighted the importance of the longterm uptrend line, and indicated that, if it is breached, the trend changes.Now, the break of this longterm uptrend line seems to be very significant and surprises can come on the downside now. Unless 0.30-0.35 is materially broken, expect prices to decline over the next days or rather weeks, down to larger resistance in the 0.11-0.14 area.I will try to narrow the support ranges once the pattern becomes clearer. There are still huge selling orders just above 0.28 in mtgox which is massive resistance. Unless this resistance is cleared, there is no upside and prices may meander between here and 0.20 and potentially in another wave down to 0.11-0.14 if more BTC holders get impatient or nervous like today. This is to share an interim alert on BTC/USD.Prices are violating the longterm trendline and have broken DOWN.We will see how material this break is, but the technical picture does not look good at this stage. It at least means that the correction that started on Nov 6th may be extending to previous support levels.One resistance is 0.2 $. If this breaks, we may quickly see prices moving down to the before-mentioned 0.11-0.14 $ zone. Agree. In my mind, this is about create awareness and then make people try bitcoins. perfect. that makes more sense wealth, finance, financial is also good The decentralized dating idea has huge potential to appeal to people.this is a great white space territory that can be occupied  Kiba: can we extend the campaign to keywords such as Wealth protectionFinancial crash? http://mtgox.com/blog/?p=60Tonights update including the special for this week with the order book review. I just downloaded it and found it quite creative! I love Zermatt. Have skied there before... and would for sure go again! http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/4697943another one (same content as irish times today) This is a great idea. @kiba: you are rightThere are many other financial markets displaying very low volume before breaking out either way. this is just normal and so is trading bitcoins on MtGox or anywhere else +1100% agree Agree, we should not push it down the throat.At the same time, bitcoins need more adopters and if done appropriately and in a balanced way, this interview can move a lot.Based on what I experienced from bruce, I do not think there is a risk for "pushingtoomuch" http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=85I am offering again my beautiful stamp collection.. maybe a x-mas gift? You're fantastic! We can fully trust you. Maybe there is too much going on to establish this...But, what do you think about the idea of using X-Mas as a way to further spread bitcoins?Enable a way to give some bitcoins as x-mas gift in a very nice way (other than the anonymous way we currently have)? We just need  a x-mas design card with a link that people can "redeem" the gifts. 
The  simplest explaination is that there is one big player (if you follow the threads you know who) who is trying to sell more than 100,000 coins gradually and it takes time until the market has absorbed it.There is a balance because there are gradually new buyers coming in and "bitholders" have no intention to sell because they believe there is a chance that BTC/USD will explode anytime soon again. it is another very good way to diversify trading options.... And like for other financial markets, Technical analysis will remain fully valuable, because we analyse price movements in the first place. Perhaps we can even on top create the best X-Mas gift:Bitcoins for your family and friends. 10 BTC now might be worth minnions in some years...And perhaps we can design a bitcoin in X-Mas designs as temporay edition :-) Thanksgiving is a huge event, and statistics show thta people are shopping a LOT (black friday but also beyond) and people spend a lot of time on the internet.Shouln'd we get something BIG out in the next 48 hours?If yes, what?* advertising* tell-a-friend* shop ~insert prodict~ & get 10 BTC for free :-)* articles* etc As promised, here is tonight's Technical BTC Update. full update + charts on:http://mtgox.com/blog/?p=55As many of you have realized, the market is relatively unchanged over the past days, so I only did minor tweaks in the re-post of Wednesday's update. I am sure price action will get exciting again. Often, this happens when most people do not expect it, so stay alert.Overall, there are no fundamental changes in our the outlook. The bulls are in the attack, but the bears hold the lid on the market around 0.30-0.35$.Analysis1. Long term outlookBTC/USD are in rally mode. The longterm chart that shows the perfect uptrend line (now around 0.265 $ and rising ) and also the 0.30 - 0.35$ resistance.Strong upside targets are the previous high, 0.50 $, dollar parity at 1.00 $, and then the 1.30 - 1.50 area.Support lies in the 0.265 area (trendline), 0.25 and o.20-0.22 afterwards.2. Short term updateNo change: The inverted head and shoulders pattern is still intact, awaiting the breakout to the upside, which is still the most likely scenario. Based on my daily analysis of the order book, ASK volume is declining, indicating that buyers "slowly eat up the cake above them". great! you are a true BTC economist  (I mean this positive!) thanks @Madhatterthis is a great breakthrough! chapeau!one question.. what do you do with all the bitcoins go are getting? also perfect. i was in St. tropez last year :-) me too this year and Zurich is not just around the corner as I am in Lausanne/Geneva area, but lets keep it in mind for next year especially when we have more people joining.We can have a day of skiing together in Feb or March 11! :-) I agree.Perhaps we should also discuss about the purpose of using the bounty for again.What has the best rate of return for the bitcoin idea?* a nice, expensive video* or something else that has more impact?You probably get my bias .. As a next advertising wave, we could think about a different target group: People who want to preserve some of their savings in the current economic turbulence.Can you advertise on google keywords / websites that are viewed by those people? Potential keywords could be * savings* safe investments* protecting capital* protecting wealth,etc.Selling line could be:Protect your wealthSave(or invest) in BITCOINSIt is important that the landing page is then NOT bitcoin.org (because this is to "techy"), but a different site that best enables those people to i) get information about bitcoins and ii) to easily invest at least small funds into bitcoins as a start. Anyone in Switzerland? Sent 50 BTC just now! True"The first 500 people to install bitcoin get BTC 0.05 absolutely free from the Bitcoin Faucet."Perhaps this could be integrated on the landing page of the banner link (or does it point to bitcoin.org?) so that people don't need to search for it. I think it is a good start, very simple.My only big comment is to integrate a call to action ."Bitcoin: The currency of liberty. Try it now."Believe me it works much better than without it. As a second wave, we could even think about an incentive (like: The first YYY people get free bitcoins worth 5 $, or we can do a raffle)I'll send the 50 BTC this evening then. Finally, we got another "exchange" (should better call it "gateway") opened which makes BTC available ina  simple way via credit cards , Visa and Mastercard.bitcoingateway.comNow we can start advertising, in my humble point of view...I donate 50 BTC! And thanks to those few who have donated recently.Makes me feel motivated. We got some coverage yesterday, making it into the top page of google search in past 24 hours ....  http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4189074 http://mtgox.com/blog/?p=49New update Thanks chaord.

Just trying it out with my BTC Technical Analaysis chart from Nov 18:http://ub.yepcorp.com/file/download/7Don't download it too often because I don't want you to spend too much money on this one. Just to try it out. I may use it for further Analysis in the future to share files.Great idea hippch! This is what I answered (I hope it is true that we see soon easier and safe-enough ways to buy bitcoins:"So can you tell us more? Like every 5 pages. post the links or a summary of this Thread including, how we get started trading Bitcoins etc. THanks in advance:"Thanks for the in-depth comment. You are right, this really has big potential.Here is a snapshot on trading bitcoins:1) There are 4 online exchanges:(1) MtGox http://mtgox.com: This is the biggest exchange wth highest turnover. Average daily USD turnover volume in the last 20 days was 15,000. This exchange works really very well. Transcation fees at 0.65% on every transaction.Best way to get funds in was Paypal USD before scammers caused some limited fraud and MtGox moved to liqpay, than libertyreserve. No fraud since then and it is all up and running. I know MtGox is looking for better ways to allow fund inflows. If this can be done, prices will skyrock as there are loads of people who want to buy bitcoins.(2) Bitcoinmarket https://www.bitcoinmarket.com/ : This allows liberty reserve USD, Paypal USD and Pecunix GAU. Because of the scammers, the owner stopped taking new registrations. However, for the ones who are in it functions perfectly. And the owner also takes new traders / investors who are known as honest folks from a longterm history on the bitcoin forum http://bitcointalk.org/index.php .(3) Btcex https://btcex.com/?language=en :This works for Russian Rubles RUB. And it has started to accept also WMZ, WMR, WME. (I am not sure what this exactly is).The positive is that this exchange accepts bank wire (but in RUB).(4) Bitcoinexchange https://www.bitcoinexchange.com/ : This is an exchange that allows EUR funds. Also here, bank wire is working greatly and it also allows sms or phone call payment.There are also some bitcoin / cash exchangers https://www.bitcoin4cash.com/andhttp://bitcoin2cash.com/.Bitcoin charts are really great here: http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/Bitcoin Analysis is available here, on the technical analysis forum and on http://mtgox.com/blog/There are some folks working on opening more exchanges (it's a race who is first..), particularly making it simple and safe for even your grandma to purchase bitcoins. If this happens, I am sure 1) BTC/USD prices will skyrock and 2) a bitcoin-accepting-business economy will flourish.Hope this helps a bit. Let me know if you have more questions. agree with you.At the same time, they need to make it easy.bitcoinexchange is great for Europe folks, and we need something similar in US, Asia, Russia, etc. done... I guess it is gas +petrol, gasoline) to fuel your car  bla Based on last nights offers, spread is lower at 14%. Still significant, but better than no BTC :-) This weeks poll result is much different to last week when sentiment was very bullish (bulls 57%, bears 18%).This week, sentiment is rather bearish (bulls 21%, bears 50%) which indicates a contrary signal. This supports that chances are higher for a rally vs. continued decline.Lets now see your votes for the next 7 days. A new poll is open as of now. I got a great reply on forex factory~> If some of you can post a reply there this would further help and drive credibility. When I have a little more time, I will also drafta comment.http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4186522#post4186522"If this is what I think it is, value will increase as the demand for cpu increases. However with technology advancing and computers becoming very cheap cpu power is also decreasing in cost.the demand will steadily increase, so the fundamental side will sky rocket prices as we grow into the digital age.The price stabilizers will ultimately be the advancement in technology as CPU become more efficient.Honestly this idea, was nothing but a rant that my techy brother introduced to me years ago. I never thought this would become a reality so soon.So I'm in.This is not some scam. And this is actually has value, unlike fiat currencies.Now to buy bitcoins with libertyrresever, lol. dont even. LB is a scam and a big rip off when you pay 5% processing both ways, buy/sell.now with a wire transfer, yeah thats honest, now I can dump my USD and get something with value that can be used in the future. lol.Now as far as manipulation. Of course their will be manipulation by the technology companies and the companies the rely on the digital age like Skpye(VOIP) networks, website, banking (forex) etc. just think about how DEPENDANT we are on CPU. Without fast processors, we wouldn't be able to post all our charts on FF. Just think about all the servers that make our lives efficient.So can you tell us more? Like every 5 pages. post the links or a summary of this Thread including, how we get started trading Bitcoins etc. THanks in advance" great idea.what is also missing is stop buy / loss ordering, trailing stops, etc (this is related to your idea above but would need to be implemented in the exchanges) I would also join with some bitcoins, but I'd prefer if we first manage to have easy purchase of bitcoins enabled (see separate thread under bitcoinrally #2) .why?because if we advertise people will get attracted. Many of them would then want to buy coins. If they then don't find a 1) fast 2) easy 3) relatively secure way they will get disappointed and may not come back.The current possibility on the exchanges is too slow and complicated( ie liberty reserve) I am sure it will ramp up.But some efforts are needed to fulfill strategy 1: Get easy access to BTC. Someone has to step up and enable it fast before the momentum dies. A couple of people had asked him to withdraw more and he has quickly enabled this. That was about 2 weeks ago so I don't know how it would work with 90,000 today.I have communicated with him last time this Tuesday and perhaps he is out as he did not respond to my mails on Wed + Thursday. Perhaps he is just taking a couple of days off. bitcoinexchange overall is probable very good, if the spreads would not be horrendous. I had a look into this a couple of days ago and the premium vs. the other exchanges was huge (20% - 30% more per BTC!)Based on last nights offers, spread is lower at 14%. Still significant, but better than no BTC :-) Fully agree overall. My point was slightly different, though. I am thinking about the current owners of all available bitcoins (not if new users would try to buy them all which obviuosly would increase the price massively). If the current amount of 4,600,000 bitcoins would be owned by 1,000 people, they would on average have 4,600 coins onlyand they would be currently valued at about 1,200 $ each. Obviously there are bigger and smaller "BTCholders", but may point was just to show that on the enture earth, only 1000 people would be able to buy something meaningful (like a new laptop for xmas with bitcoins). Or if its 10,000 people they can buy 1 nice toy  for 100$ each and then the entire bitcoin amount is spend.that is my point: the purchasing power of bitcoins is so small right now that it has to increase at least 100 of not 1,000 fold to enable businesses to accept it. agree with the 2 words of Economic GrowthAnd this can work via  a twofold strategy:1) enable more people to buy bitcoins in a very simple way2) in parallel offer more and more ways to spend themCurrently, about 1000 people could have 4,600 bitcoins = 1,200$ each and this equals the entire amount of BTC and economy. This is jokingly small . A stable BTC/USD is the worst that can happen to the idea of bitcoins. Prices have to move up substantially. If not, the bitcoin economy stays mini and may die.I am not saying that this price increase should come from speculators, but significant money inflows are needed to make Bitcoins big enough.Only then you can see a parallel increase of businesses accepting bitcoins for payment.For example, the current size of the economy with 1.3 $MM is nothing than a water drop on a hot stone. At prices of 100 $ per bitcoin it gets a bit more serious. +1 exactly... Who can establish that? Volunteers needed!100BTC from me for the first one establishing it.
bankwire in the us, Europe, Asia would be perfect One more plea..: Could you make the default exchange on the "charts" page the exchange with the highest volume?Currently, bitcoin libertyreserve is the first one showing up, but almost has no trades at all over the past days and weeks.thanks And over the past 18 days, 720,000 Bitcoins were traded at MtGox. This would have been 15% of all bitcoins. However, I guess that most of the coins traded were all the same, coming back to the number above. There are probably 150,000 - 300,000 Bitcoins sitting in MtGox.Plus, there are significant USD MtGox funds sitting there as well. For exsmple:on MtGox alone, there are about 140,000 bitcoins in the order book for saleon top, there are for sure many more in there that are not for sale The Rally #3 could start if we make it easier for "Joe Average" to buy them. There are many threads about it, but I do not see a lot of concrete plans?Can someone summarize what the status is?Perhaps it makes sense to open a separate thread only for this: "How to make it easy to buy bitcoins for the average person"What do you think? well... I believed that  bitcoincharts.com shows each individual trade also from mtgox  on the homepage. Then bitcoincharts.com could calculate the weighted average trade price and then create the corresponding point on the charts.I apologize if I am mistaken. agree with your logic about the better accuracy if weighted price poer trade would be shown, ... but ... if you want good charts, why don't you go to bitcoincharts.com and get them?you don't need to go to the nyse.com to get good charts +1 MtGoxYou are doing a great job, and you have been doing it for free for many months. The trading on your side works best, according to my colleagues and friends.Probably there are some people here just jealous who have almost 0 volume on their exchange.Keep the great work up!Of note: Yes, the site could be improved, but I am sure that MtGox would be happy to take contructive suggestions of active help, rather than people complaining about it all the time. People complaining are cordially invited to create a competing exchange if they think they can do it better... sorry for the hard words, but many of the above is just very unfair. http://mtgox.com/blog/?p=42 Ticker---- Strong volume to the upside -------- rallying toward 0.30 ----- yeah!next niche:bitcoin shoe shopping!and...cosmetics fragranceswomens designer clothesJewelerybeauty farmsmale stripper home service...

A dating site that only accept bitcoin for dating.this may be big.. but only if we are successful making bitcoins widespread enough, including women... by the way, what is the current gender split on bitcoin users / here in the forum? My guess is its 90% male.. The bitcoin forecast is on track. Proces moved up yesterday and almost hit 0.30$ before reversing lower because of the resistance we mentioned over the past days and also the new orders you have stated. Long term, we will stay in an uptrend, unless the uptrend line in the 0.17-0.20 area is broken significantly.Short term, prices may move sideways in this 0.17/0.20 - 0.30 zone. Short term may even mean weeks/months, unless there is a substantial breakout in either direction. This sideway move still means a +- 30-50% price move, so for short term traders and people who want to accumulate bitcoins, this range may still be very attractive. http://mtgox.com/blog/?p=34 http://mtgox.com/blog/?p=28 This is AWESOME!and the guy looks much better than me :-)Please continue :-) +1genau As prices are not moving a lot recently, here for you tonight a theoretical section around Elliott Waves, applied to BTC/USD:The last big rally start started around Oct 7 can be counted in textbook manner as an impulsive 5-wave. The decline from the Nov 6 high could take the shape of 11 different correction pattern.The simplest pattern is the a-b-c zigzag decline, which is illustrated in the posted chart.Let's now also consider time relationships. The rally from Oct 7 lasted 29 days. Common Fibonacci time retracements are 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%. This points to the following time targets for an end of the correction that started Nov 6:1) Nov 16 (+11 days, 38.2%)2) Nov 21 (+15 days, 50%)3) Nov 24 (+18 days, 61.8%)Watchout: Time targets are less critical than price targets and wave patterns. Hence, use time targets as additional tool, never as the only one.Your S3052http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4174416#post4174416 new voting is active :-)lets see what the sentiment is this week
Hi Michael,mein Eindruck nach 2 Monaten hier ist dass es eine gesunde, gute Mischung von leuten gibt. Die meisten mit denen ich persoenlich zu tun habe, sind von der Idee, dem Konzept von bitcoins sehr ueberzeugt und wollen es weiterfuehren. Oft treiben sie sogar umsonst die Sache voran, und entwicjkeln tage, monatelang bestimmte programme, websites, etc.Wie du gemerkt hast gibt es auch eine Handvoll leute, die enweder nur auf geld aus sind, oder einfach stunden-, tage, wochenlang diskutieren wollen. Meiner erfahrung nach lassen sich jene nie ueberzeugen..Also, weiter dranbleiben, und "chose your battles": Manche muss man wie im richtigen leben einfach labern lassen dann hoeren sie schon von selbst auf.Zu der sache selbst: ein starterkit finde ich gut, aber meiner meinung nach genuegt auch ein einfacher weg bitcoins zu aquirieren ("purchased trial is better than free trial", denn wenn leute was umsonst bekomen, gehen sie anders damit um als wenn sie etwas dafuer einsetzen mussten.Vielleicht ist ein win-win ja sowas wie ein Starter-Discount, d.h. die ersten 100 BTC gibts 10% oder 20% billiger.bis bald wieder I think there are two things to distinguish:1) How to easily acquire bitcoinsThis should really be very simple if we want to have bitcoin usage growing. At the same time, it should not be mandatory to give it out free. If some people chose to do so, fine. I compare it a bit with seeds. To enjoy a growing apple tree you have to go into a store and buy seeds. If your neighbor gives you a couple of seeds, nice from him, but you shouldn't go to your neighbors garden and steal the apples.2) How to generateThis is like gold mining. A novice with a spade alone won't be able to get a lot of gold. But this is fine, because gold miners invest a lot of resorces (capital, people, technology) into it. They have deserved to mine more gold as John Doe Average.The only thing we need to be careful is managing expectations. It should be clarified in the client, on bitcoin.org, etc. what people can expect to generate with a couple of different computers systems (standard PC, laptop, server clusers, etc... at least ballpark figures). There is really no need to change the system, but we all do not want to disappoint new (potential) bitcoin users.Makes sense? As BTC/USD is sleeping right now, I have some spare capacity to provide a brief update on one selected market as an appetizer for free:SILVER spot in $I am chosing Silver as this has been discussed a lot in this forum. Key sentiment was that Silver will continue to rise, which in my view is a clear contrary view. Instead, Silver is on its way down after an "x-mas tree rise". x-mas tree often look very symmetrical...Silver has registered a key weekly downward reversal last week (new high at 29.35 $ , but then close down for the week).This reversal may hold for months, if not years to come. Prices should initially move quickly down to 20$ , which is a big decline from current levels, and a (leveraged) short position may prove very successful.Key watchout for that call is that Silver sports very often "double tops" (see peaks in 2006, 2008). But in any case, a pop to a new high should be quickly reversed to the initial target of 20$. Further downward potential exists to well below 10$.Your S3052 I feel no need to post another update this evening. All has been said this morning, so I am posting this again, with minor finetuning.The market is dead (for now)."Based on price and volume developments over the past days, we see the most likely short term direction DOWN.Prices may test the longterm uptrend line (currently around 0.13-0.165) or at least the 0.20 support area before potentially continuing the rally.Only a break above the 0.30-0.35$ range will invalidate this picture."Next update Wednesday, Nov 17th (provided the market starts to wake up again)Your S3052 +1 love the idea! This is to post an interim alert on BTC/USD.Based on price and volume developments over the past days, we see the most likely short term direction DOWN.Prices may test the longterm uptrend line (currently around 0.13-0.165) before potentially continuing the rally.Only a break above 0.35$ will invalidate this picture.S3052 The point is not about the definition of customers or potential customers or (I should have better called them) potential USERS.we need to quickly enable simple ways for them to buy bitcoins.I agree with grondilu that we should not think they should get them all for free - by the way, bitcoin faucet is great but most people want af least a ciuple of hundreds of bitcoins.there are so many people interested out there who will be willing to bug some limited amounts of bitcoins. yes, its related to the size of the sell orders. If one really wanted to sell that many coins soon, one would not put so many orders in at the same time , but would let the market move higher and then skim it.we may never find out exactly what's behind , and clearly this is all allowed, but I guess this is someone or a few people who know exactly what they are doing, and there must be some deeper objective behind (an objective that required keeping the market under 0.30$ for quite some time) "customer is boss"If there are many complaints, we better take them into account We still don't understand the motive behind those sell orders. ... and we are still in the same deadlock as the 130,000 bitcoin sell orders are still ceiling the market.Now buy orders moved close to the sell orders which further reduces trading activity ultimately.Unless buyers come in prices will trend sideways or down for a while. fine with me.. in the world of marketing, you'd execute it like:0% transaction costs**most transactions have zero cost or *with the use of ... most transactions have costs below 0.01% Just posted and on top, I have sent them a private message:"Hello,I recently joined flattr and I really love the idea.However, the payment options you offer have a fundamental flaw: They are all too expensive as they charge huge fees.Please have a look at BITCOINS, as this has all the advantages you need PLUS the benefit of 0% transaction costs.

Just a comment:Currently, it seems that one or a few big players put huge selling volume into MtGox at 0.30-0.35 $. This can have a number of reasons. One of them could be that they try to acquire much more bitcoins to dominate the market even further.By putting huge selling volume into the market, they ensure that the market can not rise (unless people buy about 100,000 bitcoins). With this strategy, they put a lid on the market to collect cheap coins.Otherwise, it would not make sense to show all market participants the huge selling volume so openly. If they would be interesting into rising prices in the short term, they would not show their sell orders, but would do this more hidden (as some other forum member has pointed out as well). As promised, here tonight's Bitcoin Forecast and Bitcoin Technical Analysis Update.Our forecast over the past weeks and even short term over the past days was fulfilled in an almost text book manner. (just look at the previous updates).Sometime we will also be wrong, so please recognize that you trade at your own risk. Good advice. Thanks.Let me find out with them why they have moved it. At least I want to ask one question (to find out whether it was because I am not yet trusted enough on this forum or if they think it is because of bitcoins not widely accepted as commodity / currency.Any objections before I ask them? Someone from forexfactory moved our thread to the category "Forums > Commercial Forum (beta) > Under Evaluation".I don't understand it but as long as people can see it I am fine and don't think we need to fight this battle.Here is the new link:http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=264527&page=2

Interim bitcoin forecast and bitcoin technical analysis update:http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4159453#post4159453 couldn't agree more with you, and that is why I am adding polls here to understand sentiment, and incorporating volume reads, money flows, and other indicators , the order book, elliott waves, etc.when I saw the order book, it was very clear that the most probable direction for the bitcoin forecast was not up in the short term. This facebook site is very active in German (no mentions of a cancellation)  As promised, here tonight's bitcoin forecast and bitcoin technical analysis.The overall picture of a rally does not change at all, despite todays volatility and crash type decline over the last hours.BTC is in its early stages and with low overall volumes, volatility is high. The more BTC grows in terms of people/businesses using/accepting them, the lower volatility will get.Analysis Nov 2 (48h chart attached)1. Long term outlookBTC/USD continue the rally, with higher highs and lower lows.I am raising support level to 0.10-0.13 $ based on the longterm lograrithmic uptrend line (as posted a while ago). As long as prices do not close below this level, we are in an uptrend.If this level is broken, a deeper correction to the 0.06 level is then possible.Strong longterm upside targets are 0.50 $ and parity 1.00 $.2. Short term updatePrices consolidated in a triangle over past 48hrs before breaking down. Based on triangle analysis, price target for this corrective wave is 0.3 (triangle base) - [0.5 (high) - 0.3 (triangle base)] = about 0.10$ which fits nicely with the above mentioned channel up-sloping trend line.There will be small bounces on the way down. Small bounce levels are 0.25, 0.20, 0.17, 0.13. I expect the target of 0.10-0.13 to be hit in the next 1-3 days.Only a rise above 0.30 (hourly close) will make BTC continue the rally short term. sorry, for some reason I clicked on "lock" . now it is unlocked. This is to start a regular weekly poll for BTC bulls and bear sentiment. I am using bollinger bands as part of many tools to derive bitcoin forecasts and bitcoin technical analysis.And to be clear, prices can break out of the triangle in both directions.If prices break 0.3 significantly to the downside, we enter a correction that has strong targets of 0.17, and then the channel trendline around 0.13 (as I highlighted in my previous updates)And, my colleague at IRC is right, to get a significant breakout, new buyers need to come in and spend approx. $50k. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4156088&posted=1#post4156088 great! thanks great to get competition.Can you share what his bitcoin forecast and bitcoin analysis is or how I can view it? Thanks for digging into it.What I mean is a continuous chart of BTC/Gold spot (for the future, but ideally also historical since the start of BTC trading). As the dollar value of BTC will not really tell a lot longterm (the dollar will eventually disappear), the real expression of BTC value will be gold.Hence a chart that looks at (at least daily) BTC/gold ratio will help a lot - to continously see what the real global purchasing power of BTC is.example:          BTC/USD        Gold/USD     miliBTC/Gold (=BTC/Gold*1000)Nov 1  0.17               1355          0.125461255Nov 2  0.19               1357          0.140014738Nov 3  0.21               1348          0.15578635Nov 4  0.25               1387          0.180245133Nov 5  0.29               1384          0.209537572...If you can extract the actual Gold/spot prices from a different financial source (yahoo, bloomberg, cnbc, etc.) you can generate this automatically every time frame. One more question:The "volume in currency" option does not work. Is there a way to make this work? thanks Could you link in a Gold $ spot price from a different source? Then divide the BTC price in USD from MtGox by this Spot Gold price, automatically..?

Breakout on the upside will enable a short term target of 0.6 - 0.8, before the parity can be reached in the more medium term (days).
Agree 100% with Ribuck.Prices are driven by bitcoin investors and probably all/ most of them have no intention to sell , which is expressed perfectly in the charts.There is still a lot of upside in bitcoin forecast.And this can be fostered if exchanges open up or existing ones make it easier to add funds. Coming back to the original topic:After I started a thread in the forexfactory.com forum, some people have jumped on board and have questions. I think it is a great opportunity to answer them and make the bitcoin idea more widespread.Can someone help answering those questions?Either1) Please post the replies here and I will then copy them into the forexfactory forum   or2) Please subscribe to the forum and then get active yourself.Here are the questions/comments:"Weird idea to generate coins, I try to understand their idea.Somebody has to use our pc to generate coins. Who is that " somebody ".And what about the privacy, can we trust that " somebody"?""To be successful they need absolutely a " Cyber army "" Bubble talks also appeared in the late 1990s and the stock market rally still had huge legs.From a sentiment point of view on bitcoin forecasts, the rally will only end if most people, including people here on the forum believe the rally won't end. +1I have talked recently to many people confirming that MtGox service and credibility is great. Now we are in a forexfactory - thread with bitcoin forecast. It took me a while to get this done.http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4152720#post4152720 Here is a special Interim Technical Bitcoin Forecast Update, given the acceleration of the rally (which develops as expected in previous updates: "surprises are likely to occur to the upside, and buying panics are always possible. Strong targets are 0.25 $, 0.50 $ and parity."I wanted to share with you a longterm picture, now that (thanks to some heroes here: tcatm), we have a fantastic charting tool.I have charted BTC in all USD over the past year. I used log scale, which, given the extend of the rally, is better than using normal charts.Key question was to define a price target. I constructed a parallel trend channel, which is derived from a very nice and almost ideal uptrend line connecting the lows. When looking at the upper trendline, price targets of 1.0 to 1.5 $ over the days/weeks are possible. Of course, this is not likely to happen in a straight line, but the parity target will be a magnet for prices.Again, a correction / consolidation can happen as well, but as long as prices do not break 0.15-0.17, the upper targets are not unrealistic.Next update Monday, Nov 8th. this is the promised update on the bitcoin forecast.I keep it very brief as technically norhing has changed.The rally is underway and the next significant upside resistance is not easy to identify, as BTC/USD is making new alltimehighs almost on a daily basis.Expect surprises on the upside in this exponentially rally. Even Usd-parity might be reached faster than expected.Only a close below 0.173 would make me reassess the picture.Next update monday. look at the chart selecting "hourly" or 60min as time frequency. Interim Update- ticker -* BTC/USD broke out above 0.2 and stays above* Next target 0.25 (days) and 0.50 (days or weeks)* only an hourly close below 0.173 changes this picture thanks a ton. I will do when I find  a little bit more time you are a master!Now I have the proper tools for the Bitcoin technical analysis!thanks fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Now we see intraday volumes. I will use your charts probably in the next technical update. As promised, here tonight's Technical BTC Update. The overall picture does not change at all, despite todays volatility. No signs of a BTC rally end.Analysis Nov 2 (48h chart attached)1. Long term outlook BTC/USD continue the rally, with higher highs and lower lows. Key long term support is 0.09-0.10$. As long as prices do not close below this level, we are in an uptrend. A deeper correction to the 0.06 level is then possible. But as long as this level holds, surprises are likely to occur to the upside, and buying panics are always possible.Strong targets are 0.25 $, 0.50 $ and parity.2. Short term updatePrices did a big spike down and up today. As MtGox does not display short term volumes (like 5, 15, 60 min prices plus associated volume), I cant tell what exactly happened. It is clear that a few market participants can move prices significantly for a couple of minutes / hours until more people realize and step in to bring the market back in balance. This will change once more funds and players participate.In any case, prices quickly returned to the trading range between 0.19-0.20 that was dominant over the past 2-3 days.Next target is the breakout above 0.20 $.If, instead, prices close below 0.173 for a couple of days, we may enter a correction with short term targets of 0.13$ (former resistance) and then longterm support of 0.09  0.10$.Next update Friday, Nov 5th  Fair point.  /... but WHO is doing that..?Maybe we should provide an incentive. thanks for the clarification.What about adding new other ways than LR to add funds? Thanks a lot! Much appreciated.   Volume is dropping on the exchanges (MtGox, etc.).What is the reason for it?* is it that people hold on to their coins?* is it that people spend their coins in games, other services, etc.?* is it because MtGox does not accept new users? WHAT IS THE STATUS * is it because MtGox only offers Liberty Reserve to add funds which itself takes ages to buy and is complicated?I know it is tough and not easy and MtGox is doing a great job trying to work this out, but it would be good to see what the timeline is to re-establish a proper exchange (incl. make it open to new users and easy to add / withdraw funds).maybe some other experts here can help.thanks for perspective Correlation predictions are sometimes dangerous. There may be good correlation of USD/EUR vs. stock indices for some time and suddenly things change...As an example, watch the longterm dollar index vs Gold correlation. it has lived through all stages of almost +100% correlation to 50% (+no correlation) to -100% correlation.Or take stocks vs. dollar index in the last 20 years. Or stocks vs. oil... It is often best to just let the charts speak for themselves: BTC in USD is in a rally with high strength. Currently consolidating just under 0.2 and it looks that it is setting up for the breakout to the upside.  By the way.. if someone can tell me how to upload ONE file containing more charts, I would be happy to publish more, but I am wasting hours to try getting these files small enough to get under the maximum file size to attach here in this forum   [/quote]Many people -- myself included -- think dollar volume should be included alongside share volume, when showing stock market charts.The same logic can easily be applied here.[/quote]Both, dollar volume and number of shares are things to look at, I agree. The former because of total value, the latter because higher unit volume is a sign of more liquid and often healthier markets.
As promised, here tonight's Technical BTC Update. Overall, the forecast is well on track. No signs of an end in the BTC rally.As indicated in the last update, after consolidating between 0.191 $ and 0.173 $ (sideways range), prices broke out to the upside and quickly reached almost 0.2 $, again. Analysis Nov 1 (chart attached)1. Long term outlook (no change)BTC/USD continue the rally, with higher highs and lower lows. Key long term support is 0.09-0.10$. As long as prices do not close below this level, we are in an uptrend. A deeper correction to the 0.06 level is then possible. But as long as this level holds, surprises are likely to occur to the upside, and buying panics are always possible.2. Short term updateNext is the breakout above 0.20 $, which, if it occurs, should be accompanied with strong buying pressure and rising volumes.There is currently still a divergence of volume (down) and prices (up) (see last update), but we know that these conditions can persist for a long time, and prices could rise much more than it seems rational.If, instead, prices break 0.173, we may still enter a correction with short term targets of 0.13$ (former resistance) and then longterm support of 0.09  0.10$.Next update Wednesday, Nov 3rd .Of note: I am adding a special update on Gold spot ($) today: After the 1387.6 $ high, prices turned down. Unless this high is exceeded, prices should correct deeper. First targets are 1150 and 1050, which at least will likely spark near term bounces.Let me know via donating if you like this extension of service. Gold is about to turn down for at least 10% if not 30% in nominal dollars, so one can wait to buy gold... Thanks. I just started my membership at ForexFactory.com It will take some time until I can start my own thread. I first need to prove that I am serious...  I would very much appreciate your help on the question:What is the most efficient and fastest way to buy Liberty Reserve USD?I read some comments in different threads but can't figure out what the conclusion is.thanks As promised, here tonight's Technical BTC Update.Overall, our forecast is well on track. After the forecasted brake out from the triangle, prices reached quickly the ideal interim target of 0.17 $. Prices then did indeed consolidate between 0.17 and 0.12 $ for a 3 days before breaking out to just under 0.20 $.Since then, prices consolidate on a high level between 0.191 $ and 0.173 $ (sideways range).Analysis Oct 29 (charts attached)1. Long term outlookBTC/USD continue the rally, with higher highs and lower lows. Key long term support  is 0.09-0.10$. As long as prices do not close below this level, we are in an uptrend. A deeper correction to the 0.06 level is then possible. But as long as this level holds, we are still fundamentally in a rally.2. Short term updateAfter the breakout to just under 0.20, the 0.173 level is now short term support. As long as prices do not significantly break 0.173, the immediate uptrend is intact.However, due to the negative divergence of volume (down) and prices (up), I am adding an element of caution now. If prices break 0.173, we may enter a correction with short term targets of 0.13$ (former resistance) and then longterm support of 0.09  0.10$.Next update Monday, Nov 1st. the ones complaining about bubbles, hot air, etc are always those who missed the trainthe ones complaining about low prices are the ones already investedthis is the typical psychology (Conquer the crash with) Bitcoin: The highest level of financial security to preserve your wealth. As promised, here tonight's Technical BTC Update. Overall, our forecast is well on track. After the forecast brake out from the triangle, prices reached quickly the ideal interim target of 0.17 $. Also, prices did indeed consolidate between 0.17 and 0.12 $ for a while. However, consolidation was short and did not go as deep as expected, showing once more that we are in a very robust rally, with surprises happening on the upside.Today I am publishing a chart from bitcoinmarket.com. Not because I think it drives a different conclusion, but soley to show that both exchanges show overall the same picture: an almost vertical rally over the past 3-4 trading days.Analysis Oct 27 (chart attached)1. Long term outlookBTC/USD continue the rally, with higher highs and lower lows. The uptrend is intact. Based on the recent, big move to the upside, former resistance of 0.09-0.10$ now becomes strong support. As long as prices do not close below this level, we are in a longterm uptrend. 2. Short term updateAfter the breakout that went even beyond 0.17 (to around 0.20), the 0.17 level becomes short term support. As long as prices do not significantly break 0.17, the immediate uptrend is intact.Now to the most difficult part: How long can the rally go? Well, the current rally is technically so strong (volume is rising again with rising prices), that surprises can again be on the upside. As we are making all time highs almost every day, and as we do not have long-term price history in BTC, there is still a lot of upside, and it is difficult (and dangerous) to try picking the top.The only resistances in my p.o.v are psychological ones: 0.25 (a quarter), 0.50, and the magic PARITY.At the same time, watch out for closes below 0.10-0.09 which would indicate that the rally is over in the short run, and deeper consolidation to the 0.06 level is possible. As long as this level holds, we are still fundamentally in a rally.Next update Friday. Thanks for the hint. Currently, I do not frequent a forex discussion. But I like the idea. Do you have any recommendation which one to enter? I am happy to look into that. Hi,would you mind sharing what progress you are making?thanks Thanks a lot!That motivates me even more. As promised, here tonight's Technical BTC Update. Overall, our forecast from the past updates is well on track.  Note: It is rare to see the forecast being fulfilled so perfectly as over the past 3 days (Don't expect this to be the case everytime, analysts like me can also be wrong sometimes). Prices broke out from the triangle, reached and slightly exceeded the interim target of 0.17 $.Analysis Oct 25 (chart see attached)1. Long term outlookBTC/USD continue the rally, with higher highs and lower lows. The uptrend is intact. Hence, as long as prices do not break below 0.06, we are in a longterm uptrend. (no change from the previous updates).2. Short term updateAfter the breakout, prices may consolidate now between 0.17 and 0.10/0.11$ for a couple of days before continuing the uptrend.  Only a break of 0.06 would invalidate the longterm rally. Next update Wednesday (depending on your donations :-) Agree 100%.Anything different would jeopardize the trust in the entire system.MtGox USD must be staying USD (with the expection of transaction fees as indicated above. but I'd even challenge the 5%, it needs to be lower) Could you explain a bit better what the business idea is? Sorry but I am not the expert in thing-o-matic stuff.What will it produce?How should things be sold?etc No need to worry.There are a lot of bids on MtGox.They are just not visible because of the "poor" design of the website.Bid is 0.11Ask 0.119see http://bitcoinwatch.com/ I can't complain about MtGox.I was in touch with him last week and he responded to my questions quickly and to my full satisfaction.Maybe he is out over the weekend. Still, I think we need to ensure that any BTC exchange is run professionally and with the proper risk management.  It is a pity that ebay does not allow bitcoins.But this is not surprising because they own paypal, and they will do everything possible to defend it. (look at the last week's earning release from ebay. one key driver for profit growth was paypal...)I think we need to find another way to make bitcoins used as payment vehicle , i.e.* making biddingpond big (but this is tough, because first bitcoins needs to be more uniserval before enough people see this as an alternative to other auction companies)* work with competitors of ebay (they may have an interest to fight against ebay / paypal)* amazon* etc. As promised, here tonight's Technical BTC Update. Now that this gets regular, I am almost feeling guilty that I went out for dinner and just got back late... (unfortunately they did not take BTC). Maybe BTC donation from you can help :-)Overall, our forecast from the past updates is on track.Analysis Oct 22 (chart see attached pdf)1. Long term outlookBTC/USD continue the rally, with higher highs and lower lows. The uptrend is intact. Hence, as long as prices do not break below 0.06, we are in a longterm uptrend. (no change from the previous 2 updates).Volume trends (see organde dots) are also confirming accumulation and support the uptrend.2. Short term updateThe short term triangle (green converging lines in chart) is continuing to form almost in textbook style (see theory part 1 on page 2). Look how prices turned down at 0.108 today as they touched the downward sloping triangle line.A breakout above the triangle converging lines would give upside potential towards the equal distance target measured from the Apex at 0.10 + (0.13 - 0.06). This means the next bigger target is 0.17 $ if a breakout of the triangle to the upside occurs. Further, but less difficult resistance will be at the all time high of 0.13.Based on the development of the triangle formation, I am raising the support level to 0.097 (which also equals past 48 hours low). At least, prices should come down again to the 0.101 area in the next 24-48h 1. 0.0972. Major long term support remains in the 0.065 to 0.060 area.Next update Monday. That is not quite making sense. There is a huge difference btw gold / silver and bitcoins. almost all banks and individuals would accept bitcpoins in the world. that also why those precious metals are so highly priced.but bitcoins are a tiny niche now and alomost noone know about them and accepts them as payments. unless it gets more widespread and used as payments it will stay like that. It seems like the trend is down..Which can also be related that there is a slowing down of new businesses accepting bitcoins.  
what's up with biddingpond? the site does not open for me anymore??? Any news on that. I am still excited. I observed that prices are rising in RUB to new all time highs on a daily basis, but there are two issues on the btcex.som s1) The site does not display anything beyond Oct 18 on the charts2) The volume has gone down dramaticallyWho has an idea what's going on? Here is tonight's Technical Bitcoin Forecast Update.Overall, our bitcoin forecast from Monday is on track.Analysis Oct 20 (chart see attached pdf)1. Long term outlookBTC/USD are in a clear rally mode, with higher highs and lower lows. The uptrend is intact. Hence, as long as prices do not break below 0.06, we are in a longterm uptrend.2. Short term updateThe short term triangle (green converging lines in chart) is continuing to form. A breakout above the triangle converging lines would give upside potential towards the equal distance target measured from the Apex at 0.10 + (0.13 - 0.06). This means the next bigger target is 0.17 $ if a breakout of the triangle to the upside occurs. Further, but less difficult resistance will be at the all time high of 0.13Today, I am narrowing down the support levels highlighted on Monday. There are 2 key short term support levels for the bitcoin forecast.1. 0.094 (previous all time high from summer) and an area where we saw some bounces in the last 10 trading days.2. 0.086 (current triangle upward sloping line)3. Major long term supports remains in the 0.065 to 0.060 area.Next update Friday. I also echo the request to enable a universal and globally acceptable withdrawal. As there is also a high percentage of people outside the US, we should have an easy and reliable withdrawal option for all regions (Europe, Asia, Africa, etc.) Many people including myself can trade on mtgox or bitcoinmarket, etc very well and at reasonable spreads.there is no incentive to buy from you unless you 1) prove that you can be trusted and 2) offer a better price, at least 10% below current mkt price To get this started more easily..I reduce the starting price from 100 BTC to 70 BTChttp://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=85have fun and catch the Anglerfish I was successful with my European phone.

That's all I can say for myself.Great to have a way to add funds to MtGox now again.At the same time, I believe that CurrencyFair is also an option to pursue. The are no indications that trades are fake at the exchange.People claiming this should provide evidence for this.MtGox the the single exchange where there is active trading and provides enough liquidity.If people believed that the prices were not real, they would sell, which they obviously don't enough to drive down prices.No offense, but people who are not invested enough are typically those who believe that high prices are not real as they hope to get a cheaper entry. That is the psychology of the markets. A slightly different idea to promote BTC:Most of us are users of ebay, I guess...We could add a comment in all of our selling auctions "we also accept BITCOINS as payment" (see bitcoin.org) If you pay via BITCOINS, you will get a 10% discount. Is the multiple currency option already active? I could not find it.It would also be great if you could make sure that all text is also available in English (Rules, etc.)Thanks I agree with Vic. This is the best idea I heard for a while. I support it 100%. Actually mine ships globally (something did not work properly when I was activating the auction) . I tried to edit it and it did not work neither.But overall you are right, international shipping is key , especially with the current low user base. Biddingpond is not widely used enough and hence "quite useless". Unfortunately.The site is in my p.o.v one of the best designed site in the BTC world. But it lacks awareness, offers (sellers) and buyers.Probably this is connected to the low absolute numbers of people owning BTC's. With only a couple of hundred BTC active users and then only a handful people registered at biddingpond the likelihood is too low that sellers and buyers match.The key is to quickly increase the possibility for the avergae Joe to buy bitcoins (via exchanges) and then advertise biddingpond (if we have the goal on making this work).
+1 !!! back to the original starting point.The bitcoin rally.Prices have pushed to 10 cents and hold firmly above that level. Volume has been low after the breakout. There hasbeen quite some buying interest at the 10 cents level, indicating that some folks are speculating on a further rally.There hasn't been downward pressure despite a huge increase of block generation rate despite high difficulty (280 blocks past 24h )Technically speaking a further rally is the most probable scenario. Only a close below the 6.3-6.5 cent former breakout level, would invalidate this outlook.Next resistance is 13 cents (alltimehigh) and 15, then 20 cents I love it and I am in. dwdollar,just want to recognize you for doin a great job keeping it running and clean.Since you reopened I completed 3 transactions to my fullest satisfaction.keep it up! here is the picture Hi Everyone,I decided to give it a try selling my beloved stamp collection of Ascension Island First Cover of 2007. http://www.biddingpond.com/browse.php?id=72Hope you like it. I joined as well!Good that this is starting to get more traction now!!! Keeping bitcoins bitcoins has a lot of advantages. 1) It's simpler and enables higher awareness, adoption, etc. It avoids a whole lot of confusion. (i.e. the mexican Peso was never rebranded to mexpeso..) 2) For wirtland citizens (and I will be applying soon ) its also better. If they want to trade outside wirtland, keeping bitcoins as a name avoids confusion.Net, if Wirtland does not really require to have a different name, keeping it bitcoins is a win - win. You have nailed it brilliantly (and expressed it better than I did  ).If the BTC team needs some business / marketing, strategic help I will be available. That's what I like about this free community. Everyone can have his opinion.And by the way, I am offering help; but I won't be able anyhow to play a leading role since I won't be able to spend much time due to my job. I agree with you. Some sort of incentive is needed, and only if people deliver, they continue getting it... that's human nature.I also think this can still be fun, though. because if we will be successful and achieve certain milestones on the way, we will get quite some happiness. Most people, including me would do this still mostly for fun. But as least some reward is needed to keep the motivation up.And definitely, BTCs is a good way to pay. All,coming back from "normal work" and reflecting a bit in the car about BTC, I'd like to share my thinking with you:Most successful businesses are build around strong people who work effectively in an organization. You have to have: 1) A compelling idea and business model, 2) Strong , intelligent leaders and 3) an organization and processes to enable them to achieve the maximum. (I personally have some experience since I am running a 350 $MM+ revenue business, and profitably)When applying this to BTC's we have 1) and 2) already. 1) We have a strong BTC idea and a unique P2P model. 2) I see a lot of intelligent people here, both businesswise and technically.What is missing is the effective organizational structure.We can have a decentralized "currency", but we can not be effective when we don't work more centralized and structured.Let me you you some examples:* Letter to the CCC. A lot of comments in the thread, but it started 2 weeks ago and we still have not done anything. * Global Exchanges are halted because of a handful of idiots (fraudulent scammers) and the system is still down ... since 2 weeks already* I could go on forever.  But this should not create negative spirit. There are so many great people and ideas here, but without some kind of simple but effective structure we won't get far.And we should avoid this.Proposal:1) People volunteer to take an active leadership role2) This should be spread about the key functions needed (business, technical, ..)3) We set up a voting system to elect the leadership council4) The leadership council actively drives good ideas forward, deselects less promising ones, etc.What think? Just to clarify. I am not talking about my personal situation. Actually I have no intent to sell.I want to make sure that one-sided action will not create a turbulence in the market (either crash or monstrous inflation of BTC) which could then shy away the few who are left.Never underestimate the psychology caused by small events - they can have big consequences.And I think you all agree with me that we want to see BTC alive in 10y to come and not destroyed and forgotten because of a short sighted decision. I think we should not allow withrawal of $ at MtGox until after Adding Funds is also possible again. Only one-sided allowance will bring this small and still vulnerable system out of balance.We should allow withdrawal and adding of funds in parallel. The first step to buy BTC's , then pay via paypal worked great.I am happy that we can re-ignite the BTC economy!Well done.Now I am waiting for my coins to arrive, but I am very optimistic that all will be fine. Why should any legitimate transaction be reversed. I would strongly object to that as it is totally unfair and even illegal. Is it an option to regain paypal? did you talk to them what would be required (only certified users, etc.) from their side to work with MtGox again? maybe we should offer an incentive for the 1000th (non-spam) member  currently at 999, we will soon be able to celebrate the 1000th member in this bitcoin forum .Great progress ! Agree in principle that biddingpond is very useful.However, there are not enough users.Therefore, there are requirements before biddingpond can really be used broadly enough: More people need to be able to buy BTCs; otherwise a few dozens of this forum will exchange pizzas with different toppings until they are fed up with pizzas or more seriously, have sold and bought a handful if things, still exchanging within this mini community. Only if more people own BTCs the market can get sizeable enough. This means someone needs to establish an easy way to buy bitcoins for everyone. Provocative question:      What does it take to convince paypal to get back into business with mtgox (perhaps only allowing trusted registered users that have confirmed bank accounts)/has someone asked paypal responsibles about what the barrier really is for them? What does it take to allow bank account transfers to a BTC exchange (and all this with lower fraud risks)? In parallel to the above , biddingpond needs to do advertising/marketing to grow users.
thanks. I am relieved.How are you progressing in generating. Are you still expecting to return more BTC than we invested after 30d? And coming back to the Thread-Title:Bitcoins are back above 10 cents again.  Thanks , I will look into longbets.com Every day of not being able to use MtGox to buy new bitcoins is having negative effects* not being able to grow the BITCOIN economy* not being able to recruit new BITCOIN USERS* not being able to buy more BITCOINS (as the price is further rising. Last price is above 10 cents again) I added a ticket requesting to add bitcoin as described above.hope you're doing it as well done!

We need someone who can be trusted and willing to set it up.WHO wants to do it?The one who will do it gets a couple of BTC as incentive, ok.? good idea!In terms of categories, you could put it under "coins".

Knut is a great idea, maybe he can eat fish covered in dressings depending on the other team's flags I support it. I can only speak for myself.All my funds are coming from me and it is all correct.Some comments go into the typical direction of people being pessimistic within a rally of prices.It is quite sensible to buy when prices rise. This is a consequence of having more buyers than sellers. If the majority of people did not believe in BTC, they'd sell now - but they don't.As long as most people don't believe in the rally, the rally will go on.Who can ever say what the right price for BTCs is? It can be 0.1$, 1$, 10$, 100$It just depends in what the right equilibrium is for a certain period of time.BTC get more and more widespread every day. it would be good to have some options to add funds established FAST, as the BTC price is rallying again and I want to buy more http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fed-is-dead-maybe-by-2012-2010-10-05 while the tying up does not help to buy goods and services with BTCs, we can use it to our advantage:BTCs is the BEST INVESTMENT !!!Just look at the rally over the past 3 months +1000%I am going to buy more now! Hugolp and Babylon,reading the above, I'd like to bet exclusively with you. How can we set up this in a stable way? My idea was DJI trades below 1000 points sometime between now and Dec 31, 2016. Whenever it trades below that level, also intraday, it is a win.The only question that remains for me is who can I ensure that the BTCs are still in this account by that time?Separately, we can also have short term betsDJIbelow 10,000 by Nov 30, 2010below 9,000 by Jul 31, 2011above 11,260 by Dec 31, 2010above 14,200 by Dec 31, 2011 [quote auth ;)or=Bimmerhead link=topic=1388.msg16404#msg16404 date=1286715992]I agree with your prognosis S3052, but I hope you've got those bitcoins in the bank now at 6 cents in case they skyrocket to $10 and the Dow only hits 1,005![/quote]Yes, indeed! great, i will win more if more people add bets on DJI below 1000.i accept more and be 100% willing to wait a couple of years caveden,the first issue could be resolved if someone could explain this in simple words, almost if he needs to convince his grandma.Who could give it a try? Deal Im my opinion you will be massively wrong.The DOW will also crash in nominal terms.Below 1000 points between 2014-2016 If the Russian exchange btcex would make it easier to add funds from outside Russia, then volume would increase heavily on btcex, because it would be a great arbitrate opportunity.Currently you could buy at 0.06 USD roughly at Btcex and sell for 0.092 at MtGox, which is +50% opportunity (assuming 30 RUB/USD exchange rate). How can one safely transfer money to Btex?Does one have to have RUB first or can this be done in USD or EUR or CHF?I opened an account but the explaination on the page was not clear to me. It seems it only works from Russian Bank Accounts. ICH!Superidee!Wir brauchen ein Portal welches Bundesliga, Nationalmannschaft im Fussball, aber auch am besten Formel 1 usw abdeckt.Das muss kein rein deutsches wettportal sein (es kann idealerweise eine europaeische / globale plattform sein)BWIN for bitcoins= BTCOINWIN The charts and table only show a certain range.If your bids and asks are outside the range, they are just not shown.As long as they are in your order book, they are 100% active.
Bimmerhead:I couldnt agree more. If the exponential rally of BTC goes further (which is always a possibility, especially given the high breakout volume), we may be able to buy the whole DJI in a matter of years with 1 coin ... wie konnte ich das vergessen :-)Dann in 2014 Doppelweltmeister wenn die meadels es wieder schaffen! tried to register, but did not give me a confirmation. when I then want to log in with my username it does not work   I need Dow Jones Industrial Shorts or Puts next Monday/Tuesday and pay with BTC Super!Endlich koennen wir hier auch mal sagen dass Deutschland bei der naechsten WM Weltmeister wird (hoffen und anfeuern kann man ja wenigstens), und Europameister zwischendurch  Es waer ja an der Zeit dass wir auch Deutsche Fussball Wetten mit BTC anbieten , nicht nur american football und baseball  sorry, my fault we could also ask chess web sites to accept payments i.e.gameknot.cometc. Apart from that single 0.01 glitch, the entire upward breakout was exactly as I predicted 2 weeks ago:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=749.20And its quite normal that sell order around 0.1 are jigh, this is a psychological mark and will be resistance for a couple of days or more (potentially even weeks). Here is another idea:BitcoinTrading.comThis can be a site where I give trading advice and analysis (I am a technical trading analyst with 10+ years experience in global financial markets), that I offer to apply for people trading BTC's.As I am not a webdesigner, I need someone to help set it up.what think? done!and no, I don't think Germans are so difficult that we need official moderators. I will give it a look frequently and if there are some wierd things I will let you know to intervene if necessary.Waht could happen for sure is that some folks start writing about soccer and predict that Germany wins the next WorldCup (me included) :-)Schlaaaaaaaaaaand! Hi an alle die lieber Deutsch sprechen, oder Englisch nicht so perfekt sprechen koennen oder wollen :-)Hier in diesem Forum koennen wir sicherstellen dass wir 1) Bitcoin weiter vorwaertsbringen und verbreiten und 2) diesen Leuten eine moeglichkeit geben dies in Deutsch zu tun.Nichtsdestotrotz werde ich meistens weiterhin im Englischen Forum schreiben. Sorry..I don't get 100% what the methodolody is for those scammers. How did they do that?Did they transfer funds from PayPal to ane xchange that wasn't theirs, then bought BTC and then paypal detected the fraud and took back the money? I still don't get it for MtGox.Are we sure that there was any irregularity? If there were scammers this should be investigated. But if not, price rallies of this kind happened already in July and this is the way markets work.Clearly, we should protect any people who are fooled, but at the same time be careful not to cause panic , which could destroy confidence in bitcoin overall. You forget that this is how ALL markets work. They are ALL emotional and there is herding.We need to be be careful to avoid thinking that BTC could be having a stable exchange rate.  No.Lets not make false conclusions here.The MtGox exchange works absolutely perfect. My account is accessible, I can trade (actually did 10min ago).The volume is very normal for rallies. Many people are buying (in anticipation of higher prices) and many are selling to take profits. This warning seems to be not substantiated at all.People should not look at the small exchanges as they are just not liquid enough.I checked my account on MtGox and it is all perfect. bitcoinmarket is kind of dead.MtGox is highly liquid and preferred by most people.Most people trading have moved to MtGox. this is why the market is so thin on bitcoinmarket that it is highly risky to trade there. the spreads are far too big. I will help.and I need your help, too.I don't have any it expertise, so you can send me what I should translate and I will do it . anyway I will not get into this future thing. i will keep my big chunk of BTC as long as I see it making sense, and not sell before they are worth 35$ each :-) Max,i am german and the easiest way for me was to transfer USD via credit card (3% fee) to Mtgox directly or via paypal. within seconds, you have the funds on mtgox and then within seconds can buy your BTC. All those steps are then 0% fee and the major benefit of mtgox vs. other exchanges is the minimal spread.i dont mind the 30d period to keep the funds at mtgox because i am not in a hurry to sell them :-) and can wait some days before buying sth for BTC's(i am in no way having a conflict of interested in mtgox, just sharing my great experience)
you may have to wait very long for  a crash to come, and the level from where the next decline starts may be way higher than you think.The technical pattern of the breakout is very strong, accompanied with huge volume.Perhaps we see some consolidation at "1/10parity" = 0.1 USD, before BTC break this level. you're right.Mtgox has become the market leader and on all other exchanges volumes are ridiculously low. :-)First I need to have a rough idea about when this will be.And , if I fundamentally believed into this, I could buy them now for about 0.066 100% agree I agree with the current situation. Its too co mplex.At the same time I disagree about the timing. Why cant the smart people here work this out and work together with some early adopters (maybe someone can convince LastPass or another site to work together with us to try)?Cant we challenge our self to do this in a week? the market at btcex is just too small now and the spreads are still way to high.4000 BTCs is ridiculously small market (246 USD per day). just compare this to small cap stocks where volatility is also high, nbut market cap is millions of dollars..with more people joining prices will match mtgox very soon and the exchange rate is the only variable.by the way, last price is 2.00 RUB, so now worries. probably price will be up 10fold by then Building on your idea, this could be expanded to a dating site.Dating sites have some issues with payments as they are not very anonymous. Great idea!A few thoughts.Initially, I'd charge nothing for posting notices. As you want to generate trial of new users, the barrier must be low, especially as not all people are so familiar with it. (This is the model ebay followed very successfully in the beginning. once people are loyal, you can start charging small fees)Name proposals:i.e.Trust(ed)TradeGoods-for-bitcoins Right, and the chart prediction for a breakout to the upside proved right, supported by the high volume.Next big target is the all time high around 0.08 Bitcoins are back in Rally mode!This is evident in many areas* BTC / USD exchange rate is rallying (mtgox.com)* Number of businesses accepting BTC are rising* Number of forum activities are increasingAll people in the "bitcoin team" did a great job.Lets continue! +2  Foreeverdamaged is right.Its the same like for current wall street markets. we have seen oftne enough surprises despite the regulation. I agree with FreeMoney in everything.Biddingpond is great and I would love to sell / buy.We need to have some more people from Europe as the shipping costs are too high for overseas.I have great silver coins to sell! best would be :as bitcoin is a global thing, we should also have a global exchange for all currenciesMtgox could add multiple exchange options and just use actual spot prices to convert.should we ask mtgox? i do not know who manages it wow!!!!but they will likely develop their own and see bitcoins as competition I agree that the automated trading helps providing liquidity.At the same time, there is accumulation happening overall in the btc market , with a breakout to the upside more likely than a decline.On by the way, idont hold large positions, I am not talking the market up. I just offer my technical analyst experience for perspective. thats what I think, too...it's strange that you don't find Satoshi on any popular social media site. if he'd be a known hacker or computer freak / specialist, you'd be able to find him nowadays in the internet Correct.Biggest resistance is at 0.062. There is a 10,000 BTC+ sell order at that level. If this can be broken, then there is little resistance (=few sell orders) until 0.064 ups.. just looked at the photo and it looked like  a woman.. The bitcoin market has picked up in volume massively over the past 48 hours. We are almost at an all time high volume.Let's see that sign this will bring...https://mtgox.com/trade/history
found Satoshi:its a she!  http://www.facebook.com/#!/profile.php?id=100000511382377&ref=search i offer to translate into German unless its hundreds of pages :-) on the other hand, unless he has not read any of this thread, he should reply here and say what the truth is.If he doesn't it's scary. Financial services!There are many small financial advisors / analysts  who issue daily / weekly / monthly newsletters who want to sell this to retail investors. I am not talking big institutions but "1-man show" type of businesses.I think they could accept bitcoins to grow their business. this is fantastic. thanks so much Agree 100%.We need to use this advantage rigorously. The more we slow down the more likely someone will overtake us. should we all have a drink together, say cheers and the focus more on making BITCOIn bigger vs. endless debates of what it is?sorry for that "nasty' comment, but I feel we could bundle our energies vs. debating forever (I am sure apple people could have debated decades on how to call the IPad or iPhone or mac or whatever) It seems to continue to manage some transaction volume, so there is a consistent level of interest over time.  Lower activity than mtgox, certainly.[/quote]That's correct, but the spread is terrible on bitcoinmarket vs. mtgoxbitcoinmarket: spread 2.5% to 5.0%mtgox:           spread 0.3% to 0.8% SATOSHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIwhy don't you comment?We are soooooooooooooooooooooooo curious! you can also sell your LR and pecunix vs. USD and then buy BTC with USD on mtgox, at very low spreads and no transaction fees.I think bitcoinmarket is dying and mtgox is the market leader Why not bitcoin.If the bitcoin developers and this very community here continues to develop it further, without any compleceny, BTC will always keep the first mover advantage.Gillette was the first proper razo in most countries and still it dominant market leader, despite all the competive pressure. Agree, if psychology and confidence in bitcoins would still be good during this crash, traders and BTC investors would step in big time and buy at cheap prices, similar to the May 6 flash crahs --> foreeverdamagedYou are right that with 1 million bitcoins the market would crash, but to do that, he would get less than 0.02 for his remaining 960,000 bitcoins and for most of them even less.. if more people buy bitcoins than sell them, .... YES that can mean a couple of things:* someone or many people are just sending / receiving a lot of BTC* folks are sending them to mtgox and selling (evidence is that price dropped significantly the last 48 hours) http://mtgox.com/trade/history I may disagree with silvermanSilverman: can you be more specific about what your success criteria are for a "great bitcoin product"? what could be the reason behind this?More than 10% of total bitcoins are exchanged / sent or received over the past 24h hours this is a very good discussion but I am just wondering if we should discuss this publicly in such a public forum  That's exactly my point.THE AVERAGE PERSON WILL NEVER GENERATE BITCOINS.THEREFORE, IF WE WANT TO MAKE BTC WIDESPREAD, WE NEED TO VERY EASILY ENABLE 'JOHN AND MARIA AVERAGE' TO BUY BTC.TO DO THAT WE NEED TOI) BOOST BTC AWARENESSII) COMMUNICATE THE BENEFITS (WHATS IN FOR THEM? IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE) + CREATE ENOUGH ATTRACTIVE OFFERS (I.E. GIVING THEM A TRIAL PROMOTION THE FIRST TIME THEY START IT)III) DRASTICALLY SIMPLIFY THE BTC BUYING PROCESS (possible also including an attractive first buy offer, i.e. 10% price reduction for first 1000 BTC bought). That's right, there is a chart. But volume is missing for example.
I should have been more specific about the EUR exchange.the current one seems to be trading very very light volume and there are no charts available.Here is Germany by the way ... correct.The bitcoinexchange.com from Finland does not really fulfill the standards. We need something like mtgox globally or a similar one in other regions Color should be bright yellow flourescent to be visible and distinctive great progress!Then we should see some European sites appearing.Also, it would be great to Establish a European BTC exchange or add EUR into an existing platform Add EUR as currency in bitcoinwatch.comAs i am in marketing i cant program anything myselfI have lots of ideas... it feels to me that judgementally most people interested in bitcoins are either from north America or Russia .is this true?who is from Asia and Europe?if we don't have global distribution yet this may be an opportunity.If some of you have contacts in other continents a "tell a friend" movement could be very helpful!What are your thoughts? ..and the low volatility and stable exchange rate helps increasing the stake .. :-) volatility is low predominantly because psychology is balanced. Market participants are split between the belief of a rally or a decline.volume is only a consequence of the former.like with any other global market we are in a consolidation/ sideways pattern which is almost always accompanied by low volume.only if expecation balance changes in any direction, volume will pick up substantially.Example:more people think BTC will increase in value. Some of them want to anticipate that and buy coins. To get the amount they want the bid prices up above last weeks high. Others see that and jump on the boat, driving prices further up. Some others whi did not trade for a while find out later and are worried to miss the rally and bid prices further up... Volume rises a lot..The inverse happens to the downside. agree that it won't last forever.We will get a breakout soon. IMO it will be on the upside. But clearly, downside is also possible.if we could trade options, a strangle would work brilliantly in this point, because volatility is so low.And by the way, over the last month, BTC value has dropped -10 to -20% vs most currencies. It held up in dollar terms, but at the same time the dollar fell against most other currencies. convincing more and large merchants would be fantastic progress.Crossing fingers!!! FreeMoney: fair point. I only shared my concerns to protect others.All: sorry if I go a bit too emotional First of all, I wouldn't allow you to send me that much cash in one transaction. I would insist that we trade in smaller denominations. Why aren't you willing to make smaller trades at first and go up from there once we have established a relationship?[/quote]This is yet another sign of bad practice. Requesting people to do only smaller transactions creates even less value as the transaction costs (time, mailing, etc.) are way to high.Stop bothering us with your improper business model. I seriously warn everyone doing business with bitcoin2cash exactly! i will be one of the first with this prediction.1) timing of stock market low2) DJI in nominal points at the low3) unemployment rate in June 2016 selling 25 BTC for 1 USD and then buying back 200 BTC for the same 1 USDYou are to trying to make a profit margin of 87%. Noone can be so foolish to do that!Nice try. news? I have not seen any open market for EUR or JPYBy the way, the difficulty for block generation just increased from 917 to 1318.This should boost the BTC/USD rate, all other things being equal. Difficulty has just increased. All other things being equal, the BTC / USD rate should rise. if I follow this great thread correctly, it seems that misis could be very useful.meybe we should approach it on a personal level, isn't there anyone in the forum who has some personal contacts with key stakeholders at mises? I agree that investing is not about rising prices. it is relative value that counts.But if an investment does not appreciate in value vs. a reasonable benchmark, it is a stupid investment.Examples1. You live in the US and the dollar value falls faster vs. other currencies than the BTC/USD rate = good investment vs. USD.2. If we have a deflation, BTC prices are flat, then you can buy more with the same amount of BTC = good investment. the fed will never be able to get out if this.we will first see massive deflation and depression, much worse than in the 1920's
sorry, can you explain a bit better?Do you mean if someone tries to buy a LOT btcs prices will rise: Clearly: YESDo you mean if someone will sell a whole LOT btc prices will fall: YES Seriously,it would be beneficial to drive up the value of bitcoins via1. make them usable more broadly (this factor is slowly increasing, there are daily new websites accepting btc)2. make them attractive as an alternative investment (this does not appear to happen)3. reduce the rate of new btc generation (this is currently responsible for too much selling , keeping prices flat). if the difficulty would be increased , this would change.the longer the btc exchange rate stays flat, the less interesting it is: investors will leave and interested individuals will not be attracted. I contrast, rising prices will quickly make btc broadly recognized.to be clear, no one is interested in a btc bubble, but if you compare it with some other markets, the longer sth moves sideways, the less interesting it is leading to sluggish demand (see silver prices from 1980's to 2000, technology shares from 2000-2009, etc.) Correct I don't pursue the idea to buy 10% of all BTCs, and the reason why is:I am not confident enough that the risk is manageable, there may be some uncontrollable factors.You are also right that the price would move through the roof, probably breaking the 0.1 USD mark and even much higher on any attempt to buy that much. Just seen that in the bitcoinwatch.com site we have Russian Rubles included.Great progress!Where is EUR and JPY? not too bad for a start..at an attractive average price  well,... if I really wanted to do that I better don't write about it in a forum :-)so.. I give in.. especially if you happen to buy as well :-) great. thanksthis is perfect! thanks, i am curoius if i ever see this with my slow laptop :-)anyway this generating is only fun Why November 2011? What is your expectation for in 13 months time?I could start tomorrow slowly buying BTC.There is a dude putting every day 20,000 and more BTC bids into the market around 0.06. He probably has accumulates A LOT already.Therefore, I agree with you, 60% is unrealistic now.But 10-25% in the next 8 weeks is possible. Yes, there are risks to both, upside and downside.To buy all BTC or a huge chunk anyway the price will rise a lot , probably 0.5 $ per BTC is not too far fetchedTo avoid this, some trading rules would make sense, i.e. limiting BTC possession to a certain percentage of all BTC available. Otherwise someone can easily corner the market.I could even do it. and one more thing (which I said in our threads):we need to very quickly bring the bitcoin economy to a much higher level (adding trade, games, services, spread it more to get more people to adopt it , etc.).the longer we wait, the more risky it gets that some crazy dude will destroy it with just small funds (just think about if someone who fears that bitcoins become huge.. this individual / organization can just destroy the entire bitcoin value for 100 - 200 M$) me too !  I think this is a serious risk, as the dollar value of all coins is still very low (250 M$). many folks who have saved something could easily buy 25% of the coins. But then they are not stupid, they rather sell them slowly, or even smarter wait until the next rally started.I might buy some more now... MtGox has the ostacle to forbid withdrawals before 1 month has passed so a lot of bitcoins are blocked for a while.and the volume on bitcoinmarket is in my pov rather low This seems to be a problem for many people.Either there are too few bitcoins created so far and the USD value is too low.orPeople could buy enough at the Bitcoin exchanges but don't trust them enough to buy big chunks of it. how does someone actually find out if he has generated a block? will one just see 50 bitcoins suddenly in the account or how does it work? WOW.There is an iPad on biddingpond.com in an auction.This is the real TEST for bitcoins..! Lets see if this gets serious bids and attention! I am hoping so. Unfortunately I can't bid as I live outside the US.http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=74 There could be a big way to grow the use of Bitcoins massively: via a musicdowlnload site where users pay small fees for music tracks. this could be competing with Itunes, etc.what do the experts here in the forum think about this one?  isn't it the same as investing in the stock market? you can "invest" some funds and also very quickly lose all (especially if you review that last decade)  thanks again. have already invested 3 into the next bets and picks:-)
this TAABL is so great. Congrats to the creator!Since I just had 1 single bitcoin in my wallet, would anyone donate  a few so that i continue betting? Agree, media coverage it a factor that can significantly impact the bitcoin economy, to the positive or to the negative.From a bitcoin trading perspective  , the only thing that counts is the price action resembled by the price charts. The chart can already be used well for technical analysis, and this in my p.o.v is poised for a breakout on the upside towards 0.08-0.09 we will see what happens, the market will tell us :-) i just registered on TAABL have tried to get a ticket and placed a bet.then for some reason cancelled the ticket and now my 1 bitcoin is completely gone in my account. what happened?how can i get my BTC back.. and bet again?  thanks! sounds quite logical. It seems that generation of bitcoins has increased significantly again despite the difficulty being stable at 917.What is the reason for this? Are there some experts making loads of bitcoins = "money" with supercomuting power? It is an illusion to believe that any exchange rate will be stable. There will always be fluctuations.I agree with you that there are some exchange rates that will be less unstable than others, and that bitcoin may be one that is more stable relative to real values. the exchange rate will never be stable for long periods. There will always be fluctuations depending on supply & demand and on herding/psychologie (see elliottwave.com)currently in my pov we are set for a breakout sooni think it will be on the upside based on technical factors that would be fantastic. I am ready to join! sorry if this question was asked already:what will the    bitcoin prediction marketactually predict? here is my p.o.v on chart analysis Building on the online gaming idea:Who knows folks in this industry? I have recently played "penguin fly game" which is very addictive, but to really get to the highest level you have to buy some additional help toys.. if i could have bought some with bitcoins, I'd still be playing.Maybe someone who is connected and knowledgable can contact some folks in this industry to allow bitcoin payments? Agree!One route to broaden bitcoins is to increase activity and have more people sell stuff at BIDDINGPOND.COMCurrently, there are too few sellers. If some folks start selling there, this could change the game. Good discussion above.I want to come back to the original question about HOW TO DRIVE CRITICAL MASS.Some people have express their belief that we should wait a couple of months before trying to make it bigger, but still think we should build on the momentum BITCOIN has currently. For example, bitcoin transactions, prices and turnover of coins have started to increase significantly over the past days.If we wait to long, it may die.I also agree that we need to look for ways to have BITCOINS used in the right target group, i.e.Gaming, online shopping, etc.What can we do more and faster??? Where do I see the amount of BTC in my account? I am logged in and don't see it.I have the BTC-OUT function but it does not work. Great thought about facebook and other social media sites. We should do this "bitcoin day".In terms of timing I suggest it to be very soon (i.e. in the next 7 days). My experience in marketing / PR / ER tells me that we need to eat the potato while its still hot. Now we see a good postiive trend in coverage, and risk is that if we wait too long, we might start from a lower level.Key question is how to mobilize all bitcoin supporters = how to reach them to align on a date.Who has a "list" or an idea to communicate to all bitoin owners? That makes 100% sense.Another territory is financial newsletters / analysts who have the same p.o.v. A great example is that Bitcoin was featured in Friday's Elliottwave.com Theorist by famous Rob Prechter. We need more of that! Bitcoiners,I thought it is a good idea to bring many angles in this forum together, because many of them touch this question:How to grow the Bitcoin idea and avoid that governments shut it down?I would like to see some answers / opinions on how to make Bitcoins widespread and more and more valuable, but at the same time do it in a sensible way to avoid that it will be shut down.Related to this, the founders must have thought about this question, so how did they address this question? THANKS so much. All works fine now!have a great Sunday! Thanks a lot. How do I receive BTC if you sent me one? will this appear automatically or do I need to do sth? How long does it take?
