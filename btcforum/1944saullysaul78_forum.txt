Sent you a PM. Awaiting your reply.  I prefer Startpage, but I use DDG here and there.  Lol, definitely fake. Nice read though.  If you haven't watched King of Queen, you definitely need to.   Pretty cool. Nice job!   Sold him 0.02 BTC. Smooth deal. A+ A cup of aqua. Total time logged in: 3 hours and 12 minutes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgcJ-RrWYV8 The most recent game I bought is GTA5 for the PS4. I use Malwarebytes. Depends what you're using it for. Skype is more for general stuff, whereas TeamSpeak is mainly for gaming. Meh. Way too much like Far Cry 3, really weak story. I wished they had changed up some things... King of Queens and Big Bang Theory.
