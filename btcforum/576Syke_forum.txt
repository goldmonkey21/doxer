Yeah, like that. Z80 was a nice chip, sure, but we can do better. Our new chip will need functions to aid in sha-256 so we can keep the blockchain alive. Pointless. There's no way all computers are going to be destroyed, but millions of z80 cpus will be fine and salvageable. That's just a crazy scenario. Now, designing a new post-apocalypse cpu that could be created from low-tech sources and an os to go with it, that's a good idea. Breaking records feels like a big deal, like the first guy to run a 2hr marathon. That's true because the goalposts don't move for things like that. Imagine if the distance of a marathon got shorter each year. You'd expect new records all the time. That's how the stock market works due to constant inflation. New ATHs are expected. Prop prop prop! Is there a chart of WO post frequency. Things seem to have slowed down. Almost boring. Moon? Gold is deflationary? There's probably no one in the country with more debt than Trump. Of course he wants negative rates to benefit himself, not the country. Negative rates are not sustainable. I don't understand billionaires.

Surely they burn-in on a private blockchain. Right? Right! Yeah, but 480.115 sat/B fee? That's a huge fee! "Too little?" Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Is it just me? Damn that's a bullish chart. Although the raw bitcoin supply is growing, long-term hodlers are growing faster. That means the net supply available on the market is shrinking. I need something a little more...substantial to HODL on to. They must be thinking about more than just #4. Highly unlikely such a trust actually exists.

When lives are on the line, you underpromise and overdeliver, not the other way around. Early analysis implied that Satoshi was running many computers. I missed seeing a later update that fits more in line with a quad-core desktop miner: https://bitslog.com/2013/09/04/satoshi-machine-one-mystery-is-solved-and-another-opens/ Multiple computers can all use the same wallet. But the nonces on the blocks indicate that they came from a single "system" that was very fast, probably some sort of pool-like configuration. Yes.Mostly yes. Network efficiency will degrade, but difficulty will adjust to mostly compensate. No explicit limit, but other parts of the protocol limited the blocks to 32MB. I think he meant 20 sat total fee. Mempool is being nearly cleared each block recently. There's one thing that has no place in WO. That is discussion of shitcoins. Go here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0. There's your answer. Pump initiated!
Because bitcoin isn't just a protocol. It is the whole ecosystem: users, apps, miners, history, devs, merchants, exchanges, etc. We prefer green dildos around here. Technically, that's not donny. Tweets that have semi-normal grammar, etc. are from his Social Media Director Dan Scavino. I'll definitely be partying in Thailand at 100k. Here's my estimate:MtGox has 141,686.35 BTC. They've approved 802,521 BTC in claims. Estimated payout is 17.6% BTC, or roughly $2000 USD at this time. Fiat claims complicate this estimate, but I think their fiat holdings cover the fiat claims. I'd buy that for a dollar! Small government conservatives are actually very rare in the last few decades. 240p, WTF? Are there any occurances of 6 month green streaks?

CSW is a scammer and is not Satoshi. Right, it's not 100% proof. More like 99.999% beyond a reasonable doubt proof. It's extremely likely that *only* Satoshi has block#0 private key. CSW obviously lacks that key and thus extremely unlikely to be Satoshi. Premature Vejaculation Hodling my breath until we break 9k... And even then, the stock market is flat for the past year. There's no indication it was manually added. Several transactions with the same low fee are in the block. Go for it! Bacon, eggs, cheese, steak, etc, mmmmmm. But understand it may take a few weeks until your metabolism fully adjusts, so be patient. Wine can definitely fit in a well-managed keto diet, with around 4g carbs for a good dry wine.

The real Vegeta is 8000. Yup, no more 8k. I think we can safely declare Bitcoin is dead. This 8k level looks nice. We can stay here for a while. There's a whole lot of low-fee TXs.

But it is what the text says that accompanies the graph in the original article. I declare myself "master of my domain"! Satoshi sure has balls of steel to stay hidden and not move his coins. 6k was so boring it lasted so long last time. Let's blow past 6k and never look back. No, there is no reason ever to freeze coins. Now there's a proper wall at $4780 on Stamp.
Problem solved. US immigration controls are already extremely effective. I'd like to see you try to enter the US without your ID/Passport. And then get a job/bank account/etc without an ID or SS#. Eyeballing that, it looks like we have about 2 yrs to go before we reach a new ATH. They stopped adding new checkpoints 5 years ago, but yes, the old checkpoints are still there.You can ignore the checkpoints by starting Core with "-nocheckpoints".

Yeah, it comes down to one word...liquidity. The few altcoins I mined over the years were so hard to dump. Their "market cap" is a meaningless statistic. Oh, sure, there's downsides as well as upsides, but I meant more in a moral sense. Being divorced doesn't make you a bad person. A country's divorce rate doesn't make the country a bad place.

I'll be dumping my Gox satoshis to free myself from Mark's Taint. That's cuz you're thinking in today's technology. 20 years ago, Quake II was state of the art. 20 years from now, I don't want it to be your choice, because you'll be the one causing accidents.

Time to tax the billionaires. More likely them than CSW. Let me help you with that. Yeah, to do that effectively, you need to hold balances in both places so that you can execute instantly. Definitely risky. There's no thought-police in Bitcoin. You send me a clean tx with standard fees and I'll mine it. I couldn't care less about your "purpose". Right. Never go full fiat. No, 2FA is simply two ways to authenticate, usually a password and a generated code. My 2FA encryption key is stored offline, and I have a backup 2FA offline device. If my primary device dies, and can easily set up a new primary device safely knowing that nothing has been compromised. If my primary device is stolen, I can use my backup device to deactivate my online 2FA codes and setup fresh new ones. Quite difficult. Disable 2FA on all your accounts. Setup Authy on the new phone or web, encrypted with a unique secure password. Configure new 2FAs for all your accounts on Authy. Next time you need to move phones will be trivial since you used Authy. The past is no predictor of future performance, but Bitstamp has always been good to me. They like beer? From the article, "itÂ’s unlikely the machines can be remotely exploited at all". Yeah, they're not going to comply. Yeah, that's a given. Why would the real Satoshi post a teaser message claiming to be able to prove it, but not actually proving it? We are all Satoshi! Did you even watch the video? They politely knocked on his door and treated him softly. If you had bothered to read anything about the arrest, you'd know they had concerns with destruction of evidence, so the "force" used was quite tame considering the charges.
Hard to believe nearly 4 years have passed since his last visit here. I stick with 1-2 bottles per hour (for normal strength beers). More than that isn't enjoyable.  Someone's got a script running. Not the first exchange to have this "happen". Gold is very liquid in Thailand. There are gold shops everywhere that will easily buy and sell jewelry. I'm calling the bottom. https://www.ncua.gov/files/regulatory-alerts/RA2005-05Encl.pdfI think it's safe to assume that some banks do keep scans. It's been ages since I opened an account, but I'm pretty sure they made photocopies of my ID. How? Banks don't allow anonymous accounts. How do they AML/KYC without your docs? Or you can be born into privilege and not have to "free" yourself of anything.  I'm not so sure. Looks like it's just run by one guy. Not a lot of assurances for me at least, whether intentional or not, it could have problems. Infinite inflation makes that inevitable. Videodrome was really psycho. Block 0 key, that's the only thing that would work. You can't do that, you ain't him. Most other people on my ignore list fade away. It's hard to believe he's still here. Who is saying bitcoin is 100% safe? Five nines. Nothing is 100%. The idiocracy effect is real. In Scotland drinking gin? Hopefully some good stuff like The Botanist. Icy hot stuntaz!
Great attitude. Not every end of a marriage is a "failure". Sometimes it's time to move on. mmm, Islay scotch. Although I prefer it neat, I guess some Irn Bru is appropriate. But those details are in the store's database, and when it gets hacked and sold, it then gets connected with your bank details. Bingo, all is known. Yup: Get ready for the January dip. Do people with any significant holdings actually hold physical silver? Or is it just paper-silver? Getting ready for the typical January drop. Wow, below -1.5. It's been a long time since we've been that low. I don't like cold weather. Wow, this reminds me why I'm so glad this guy is on ignore. Only a true idiot would think his pea-shooter is any deterrent to a military with tanks, fighter jets, etc. Private guns are no deterrent. If you stay out of Fiat, numerous exchanges will work for anon crypto trading. But yeah, you wanna deal in Fiat, you gotta abide by the rules of the Fiat issuers. Whatever happened to the $1000 party?  These days college is just motivation to learn something. You could just as quickly learn everything on your own, but most "kids" don't have enough self-motivation to do it, so college is a good choice. This is the real mystery, the @satoshi twitter handle "Joined May 2018". How in the world did squatters not nab that one earlier?And yeah, without a publicly released signed message signed with the private key from block 0, he's not Satoshi. It's that simple. Put up or shut up. Preferably the latter. That would probably require an actual resident ID of another country.  No volume. No volatility. /me goes back into hibernation. Yeah, this right here ^. Look, I'm no fan of Shrem, but you don't win a lawsuit by alleging someone is not "lucky or successful". You gotta show the evidence of the theft.
Holding above 50% is a good sign. It's been flat long enough. Rockets warming up... I'm bored. Seems like we've been at $6xxx forever. Not until after the next halvening. True, no way I'm trusting my memory to a seed. It's written down by hand on a piece of paper.But bitcoin wallets traveling shouldn't be considered like cash. Bitcoins are not stored in a wallet, they are stored online. They are no different than having access to your traditional online banking login. Correct. There is no such thing as "1 $BTC", so the question is ambiguous and there is no "right" answer. I would start here: Which is why "market cap" is a meaningless statistic. There is no "market" of 17M BTC. If that's what it takes for 6-figures ... I begrudgingly accept. Can we opt out? Pretty please.  Ah, the good old days. lol, inside buyer. Sometimes that night of hookers and blow goes a little too far and you gotta pay up more than expected. Wait, that's a $35 Pi and a $45 HD. A $99 product selling for $300. Suckers! It's just the Republicans. They have lost all sense. Trump destroyed them from the inside. "We have the best economy ever, so here's trillions in tax cuts to billionaires, and we can't afford pay raises for government employees, so here's a wage freeze." And the Republicans just eat it up. The funny thing is, since Satoshi was anonymous, he could still be around currently influencing BTC. Too good to be true = SCAM *Doing* something teaches you far more than most books ever could. Over 6000+ btc spend on new forum software. You'd think we'd have something usable by now. Eating ass is not that unusual. https://youtu.be/A0t2sjWX4cQ?t=6m29s
Don't trust a scammer to tell the truth about another scammer.  Do you understand how revolutionary All-Day Breakfast is?! Incomplete if they're not categorizing keto diets separate from low-carb.

Putin clearly has Trump by his tiny little balls. Good thing that's only about half of the country. Do you drive on roads someone else built? Do you get your electricity from a grid someone else built? Does your country have an army protecting it that someone else paid for? and on and on and on. You benefit from a society someone else built. It's your responsibility to continue improving said society.
Did any shorts get REKT while I was away? There is no debate. The President of the United States should side with his own country. No, I distrust Putin more than the USA intelligence. Just move the White House to Moscow already. We've never had to endure a mining bear market. Repeated drops in difficulty would be painful.

Welcome to my very small /ignore. They gave me real bitcoins for my free bcash tokens. Bar girls can't eat love. I've heard there's a silk road that helps with these sort of ideas. I think the effect is the same, just slower, since the trades aren't public. "enormous assets ... will be returned to creditors of Mt.Gox"Is "creditors" the legal term for the users that held balances on Mt. Gox? Sounds like a huge win.

I've been using BitBucket, but GitLab looks promising too. Yes, your node is useful, but no, it is not "as good as". The blockchain really only takes a step forward when a block is created. You cannot create blocks. Same here, no online wires. But at least I don't have to walk in, I can do a phone transfer. And guess how I get the confirmation transfer slips? Yes, only by fax. Our needs are finite also. Opportunity to increase your stash. Bad idea. Very regressive. Great song. Great show. Too bad those Verizon commercials make me hate Thomas Middleditch almost as much as Mark Karpeles. My role model. When bitcoin breaks 10k again I'm moving to Thailand to become a full-time monger. Bank transfers, not credit cards. By "it" do you mean the hard fork air drop qty or the hard fork coins that you've sold? Good point. It would be interesting to see a dominance figure based on actual order book sizes. Whitepaper, section 8, SPV wallets described. Yes, pools started banning dice transactions, ie spam.

So roughly speaking, if your node is better connected (with higher power miners) than the victim's node you have a good chance of winning. Sure, if you can guarantee that you will mine the next block yourself. PSA: Keep your stash away from your pets.https://twitter.com/Waynetwpfire/status/985979734206173185 Same here.

It's over 7000!!!Hmm ... just doesn't quite have the same ring to it. I got back in at 6700. All out of fiat. Ready for some pumping. Go away. Yeah, I would not recommend mining if your power costs are $.10/kwh. A serious mine should be down in the $.04 range.Over 9000! Not just infofront. Anyone can delete their own posts. No, if mining costs outweigh, then miners decrease capacity and the difficulty decreases.

People are mining on Nvidia these days? It's an old Google phone, available on Ebay/Amazon/etc.The Pixels are great phones, I just don't think you can build your own firmware straight from AOSP. Get a Nexus 4 ($100) and build AOSP yourself. Where can I find a wife like that? That's what MtGox did. We're in some weird territory. The split should be locked-in, but the price hasn't dropped. This is an interesting detail in the press release:It seems to imply that the bonus shares may transfer with the sale of a share. Very strange. Yes, that's how I read it. The shares are now split. You now own 91 shares, even though you only see 1 share in your account. Sure you can sell them, but people will only pay 1/91st for them if you sell them post-split. You won't get to sell post-split shares at full-price and then get free 90 shares.Think of it more as just a delivery delay of the free 90 shares for whatever reason. Yup, works great and is easy to recover from failures.

We're within about 10x of a pizza costing 10,000 satoshis, instead of 10,000 bitcoins. Now you tell me! I'm already at work. I wondered why no one was here yet. HitBTC supports a lot of the fork coins (deposits and withdrawals of crypto without ID verification and ok for USers). I think you might be right as long as you're lending and not borrowing: Wait a minute. They're charging a "sweeping" fee, in addition to the miner fee? That's completely unnecessary. If they want to sweep payments around for their own enjoyment, that's their choice and they should pay that fee. Yeah, trying to send less than .01 btc is going to result in significant fees. Looks like everyone is cashing out their millions. Way to start a trend cowboy! I feel like there's a joke in there somewhere...
https://www.seekingarrangement.com/ Da red wunz go fasta! It's getting to the point I need to consider moving to a state with lower taxes. Here's your intelligent discussion ... Keep your fucking hands out of my wallet you god damn thief. I'm not sure whether to call you an optimist or a pessimist. The odds of it going that low are minuscule. The hack would be investigated, then a fix would be implemented, and the miners would rollback the chain to right before the hack and continue on from that point. Bitcoin would recover. How do I know? It's basically happened twice before. A golden opportunity. I just don't get why people are selling now. But I can't complain, it's a chance to increase my stash. Thanks guys! That's a tempting offer, but this is a burden I brought on myself. I wouldn't feel right dumping that burden on you. I remember those days. I was much happier when bitcoin was $1 each. I hate having my bitcoins worth $14,500. Damn you all! Ooh, a dick measuring contest. This oughta be good. Yeah, let's keep it that way. Cashed in some bcash on today's rally and just got back from the store. Came home with a Bowmore, Ardbeg, and Caol Ila. Celebration time tonight! Yeah, it's getting way up there.

Unfortunately not usable in the US.Couldn't agree more. Feel free to offer up another place where large crypto activity is free of limits for unverified accounts. No limits on crypto deposits/withdrawals at hitbtc for unverified new accounts. lol, that's exactly where my sell order is at. Are you using 2FA with gmail?

With difficult almost always going up, we are a little ahead of schedule:(3,272 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes) / 500,000 blocks ~ 9.42 minutes per blockNow imagine what the market will be like when we hit 1,000,000 blocks around 2026! We lost page-parity.Â   Just HODL. You will soon join the suffering. My last transfer, the fee was .0008 btc for 1-hr confirmation. Are you really complaining about a $15 fee for a near-instant international money transfer? Sunday Bloody Sunday! How about a new chart? There seems to be a wee wall on Stamp at 20k. Open competition is great for the 1% that are already rich.  I *really* don't like touching my cold wallets. Leave them there nice and safe. Anytime you move the coins you risk making any number of mistakes.On the other hand, if a vulnerability is discovered, like what happened with the original addresses, then it would make sense to move them to a more secure address. Transaction fees are unlikely to be an issue. Whew, you scared me, I thought SolidCoin was back. Better include a nice fee if you want it to arrive before we hit $20k. I have to get ready for an xmas party, but I can't take my eyes off the chart. I'm paralyzed! Nuh nuh nineteen!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcFFEjq5Ap8 Sure:
Satoshi never designed bitcoin for micropayments. He knew sending .01 btc wasn't part of the plan. I'm sure some is real, but without a way to audit it, it would be wise to question it. RISC-V seems to be coming along nicely. https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/17/10/09/0019212/linux-now-has-its-first-open-source-risc-v-processor Yes, on Bitstamp, International Bank withdrawal, USD balance to a US bank. I just placed a withdrawal Wed, Dec 13, 2017 at 7:48 AM, received the confirmation Thu, Dec 14, 2017 at 3:30 AM. I should see it in my bank on Tuesday. So typically 4 (business) days from beginning to end. It might be due to the round-about way it has to go for you. I'm getting USD withdrawals to the US confirmed in a day. https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2017/GLOBAL/Not a bad showing. I'm happy with him, I got to buy the dip! No they can't.

Great, just what we need, all the Russian Billionaires buying up all the bitcoins. Hodl 'em if you got 'em. Yup, that sounds plausible.

Nope. They really are just betting on the price. No bitcoin involved whatsoever. Yeah, look at how steep those rallies in 2013 were. This is so glacially slow this time. Yeah, only about 700 BTC to go. Let me check the couch cushions. BRB... This are "cash-settled". That means they're really just betting on the price. Neither side buys any bitcoins.http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/Cash_settlement Rekkage incoming... Old news since day 1. You can do anything once you have >50% of the hashpower.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Majority_attack Take for instance this case referenced in a linked article.In that case, you accepted the check. You took control of it, therefore it is taxable. But that's not how airdrops went. The correct analogy would be this: I disagree. If I put money in a safe and say it's now yours, you don't have to declare that as income until you actually take the money. Those previous rallies felt much steeper than this one. Gives me hope! I don't see how they can make that argument if you never take control of the airdrops. Yeah, I haven't seen a Bitcoinity gif in ages. zzzzz  https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#24hMore than half the mempool is transactions with 0-5 sat/byte. Spam. Don't ignore them. Sell them for BTC and increase your stash for free! Yup, people spamming low-fee transactions. Winter is coming. He may have lost some at gox, but he was in actual control of his big stash, so that wouldn't have gone down with gox. Bearstamp lagging and not yet breaching 9000. It's created by finding the curve that best fits the price history. Bitmain, Spondoolies, etc. sent out demo units that proved they were real with real specs. If Halong Mining won't do that, I'd consider that a deal-breaker red-flag.
Adam's "I have seen it" isn't good enough. Any new mining hardware needs to be hands-on tested by an independent third-party like lightfoot. Yeah, there's 60 MB worth of low-fee transactions, dwarfing all the other transactions.https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#24h Very good, that'll make it easier for me to dump my BCH. Bowmore 1957 is up there: http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20459/lot/84/ An exciting weekend!OVER...8000... He already apologized:https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOxXwUJW0AAhcD6.jpg You must be an old-timer. That's the old code. The new code most nodes are running requires a 1 sat/byte fee for them to broadcast the transaction. Yes, zero fee is a valid transaction, but very few nodes will relay the transaction, and very few miners will include it in their blocks, so you almost never see them these days. Likely true. Somewhat related, I'd love to see this chart updated on the age of coins:https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2n205b/an_area_chart_showing_the_distribution_of/ I've found a Wacom tablet mounted under the desk works well. Yeah, but first you have to transfer your real bitcoins to a new paper wallet. And since I don't like my coins all in one wallet, I have quite a few paper wallets. Always a good idea. A wise man/woman/group once said: That's only half of the picture, the demand side. The other half, the supply side, existing holders/miners can drive the prices sky high simply by not selling. Lovely BCH rally, was able to dump some at .16. Yeah, that's the key (hehe). Always move your bitcoins to a new private key, then you can use the old private keys to access these altcoins. I like reading your analysis, but it would make more sense in its own thread since you're not discussion masterluc's analysis. Damn it, I hate cracking open my cold wallets, but that's just too good a deal to pass up. It's MIT-riced Lambos now. The real question is will we get a Bitcoinity gif at 8000? Someone hit the nitro boost.

Damn you, you just made me pee my pants with excitement. https://www.bitstamp.net/article/bitcoin-cash-update/See that? They claim to be crediting users with 100%, yet it appears they are crediting users with 50%. How does that make any sense? Cheap coins are back for a limited time engagement. Get 'em while you can! I'm still hoping someday there will be a distribution from the bankruptcy estate. Might even get some Bitcoin Cash out of it! Wouldn't you need a registered agent in PA (something like $50/yr)? Where is bitcoin going?shake shake shake Goodbye 5xxx. Welcome the new 6xxx floor. A warehouse full of ASICs vs a warehouse full of GPUs, the mining is still going to be centralized to massive farms to maximize profits with economies of scale. Any response from support? Time for an updated charted? This is the highest we've been in about 3.5 years. Here ya go: http://spendbitcoins.com/places/c/food-trucks/ I'm vacationing at Blue Lagoon next month. I'll let you know if I run into her.  From the actual article:He simply said $27k would be a "fair" price based on past growth. That's far different than a price prediction. Always, just a little. Buyback on the dips. Win-Win. Like SSS, I started with this spreadsheet and made some tweaks. jgray went pretty much all-in...https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=508254.0He recently logged in here, but didn't update his thread! 648 btc @ $5300 = $3.4 million.
And now you're up 6%. Lesson to learn: HODL. I was thinking it was just half also, but I wasn't sure what I had at the time of the fork. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=515932.0bitcointa.lk used to mirror all the posts here, but it appears to have died a while ago. You should be clear which country you are referring to. In the USA, "Virtual Currency Is Treated as Property", and thus very much subject to division. https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance PayPal has nothing to fear from bitcoin. PayPal is a middleman between credit cards, bank accounts, countries, and currencies. Bitcoin could be simply another currency for them. Right. When mining isÂ  (or projected to be) highly profitable, miners buy more hardware thus increasing the hashrate. When mining is approximately profitable, they maintain the status quo. When mining is highly unprofitable, they drop turn off miners thus lowering the hashrate. Now there's an elliptic curve algorithm. This right here. Compare the cost of keeping the mortgage to the expected return of the bitcoins. I strongly suggest hodling is going to be a far better result. Google Pixel 2 You don't have to split the bitcoins 50-50. You have to split overall assets 50-50. If you can give her more non-bitcoin assets, you can keep more of your bitcoin assets. What does any of this have to do with bitcoin? All the nodes that follow the same rules have the same blockchain. If different nodes follow different rules, they will have a different blockchain. Rules are things like "no double spend", "size of block", etc.A miner is just a node that, along with validating blocks, the miner attempts to create new blocks. Grab your cheap coins while you can. The future is the moon. The higher it goes, the tighter I hodl. What would you rather have, inefficiency or inaccuracy for a monetary system? That would only make sense if the size of blocks was limited based on the value of the transactions. But it's not. Blocks are limited in the number of bytes, therefore fees are based on the number of bytes in the transaction. Over 9000? Best to discount that month a bit. Willybot faked a significant portion of that growth. So many bears on the poll. Time for a new one. Impossible to know. There's no way to connect addresses to people, or people to addresses.
We're currently bumping into the Â€4000 barrier. I'm not touching my cold wallets, so I'm still in BCH by default. Correct. As of right now, a single $40M buy on Bitstamp would take the price over 10,000. I'm sure jgray is quite happy with the bitcoin proceeds from his house.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=508254.msg15197910#msg15197910648 * 5400 CAD = $3,500,000 People need to stop quoting market cap. It doesn't exist. For the price to shoot to 15k there simply needs to be more demand than there are sellers, and the price will keep going up. You are correct. If an address has any bitcoins, then it received those from an incoming transaction, and thus can be tracked on the blockchain. Addresses that don't appear in the blockchain by definition cannot have any bitcoins in them, so they can be safely ignored. I don't consider any alt having absolute $ value. Altcash continues to drop and is sitting at .075 btc. I'm thinking the same thing. I just can't bring myself to spend any real bitcoins on alts, but I might be able to convert some bitcoin cash into some alts. Don't get cocky. I was here when Satoshi was still active.Â   Another early adopter. Welcome! #IsBitcoinDeadhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hlN2nel5HI  Bitcoinity https://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX We only need to go up 250x to reach parity, 1 satoshi = 1 cent. Then things get extremely interesting. The more bitcoin goes up, the tighter I hold onto my coins. I once bought a yoyo for 4btc. I leave that yoyo on my desk to remind me to not make that mistake again. Satoshi has been found! Oh, yeah, lol. But wouldn't Kraken require identity verification, thus nullifying Monero's anonymity benefits? doit, it takes about $2.2M gets us over 3490 on bitstamp. Maybe you'll run into Bruce...http://onlyonetv.wikia.com/wiki/Bruce_Wagner
At least one major flaw..."Prior to the fork they could not leave. Now they have to be begged and persuaded to stay."There are lots of SHA-256 blockchains that miners can up and leave for at any time. There are even pools that auto-switch between profitable chains. You each get a facepalm. There's a bit of a wall at 2909 on Bitstamp. Easier said than done. I'm too afraid of putting my private keys at risk to touch BCH. Even 5 years from now, with 2MB blocks, you'd still fit the blockchain on that old hard drive. I don't think Bitcoin should be limited by what runs on 15 year old hardware. Sure, you might get 2x out of silver. I see 10x out of Bitcoin as far more likely, even without a scaling solution, just with the block reward halvings to come. I would be fine with that in 10 years, but I don't see why the peak would be so soon. There's no reason for it to stop growing so soon. You need to assign a probability to the question. 1 confirmation is not a 100% absolute guarantee that a double spend won't happen. Crypto "market cap" means absolutely nothing. I did not expect to hear you say this. He thinks the real target is 3 million using some special math analysis, so 500k is conservative in his mind. I bought 2 silver coins for 60 BTC (which cost $120). Fortunately, they also have bitcoin attached to them, so I'm quite happy with them. The Lambo that cost over 200 btc now costs less than 100 btc. We've got a ways to go before it gets down to 1 btc. You may be right, you may be wrong, I'm just asking for actual evidence of running nodes. The paper presented no evidence about the hardware nodes are running on. What's your evidence? Decent analysis, until they get to *guessing* what hardware nodes are running on. "Characteristics of node hardware are based on a survey performed by Steam." They might as well estimate that everyone is using Raspberry Pi's. Maybe in the winter, but not now, it's already too hot! 1 sat per byte is the effective minimum fee since anything less and nodes won't send your transaction on to other peers. Most of these transactions will confirm just fine, but slow.There are a few miners that accept 0-fee, but you'd have to get your transaction to them manually. ~2600 is a pretty nice place to consolidate. Be patient and go with the minimum fee (~1 sat/byte). Your minimum consolidation fee should be about $.15. That's an extremely low .2% fee.
Yeah, small micro-transactions with low fees like that will be the lowest priority, but they will relay and likely confirm. Do you have the stamina to stick around? I'd prefer to see it unlocked and moved to off-topic. There is good stuff in that thread. 1 sat/byte is the current default minimum relay. Few nodes change from the default. It'll get relayed to virtually everyone and mined just fine. I know, 2 weeks ago I sent 5.5 btc, just under 1500 bytes with just over 1500 sats, and it confirmed in a few hours. If you're patient, you can get away with 1 sat/byte fee and get it confirmed in a day or so. My last transaction took a few hours to confirm, just over 1 satoshi/byte (0.03 USD). Plenty cheap and fast for me. I just sold something for .4 btc. Had that been a credit card purchase, the fee would have been $30. The btc fee was $2. I greatly prefer btc. Profit-taking still quite active. I'm fine with going up 200% every 4 years. See you in 2021 at $5000/btc.  Speaking of all-in, too bad the thread is locked. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=508254.0 Bitcoin is FAKE NEWS. Stay away from the "low-fat" craze.  Sure you can, it happens all the time in buyouts and mergers.http://www.nasdaq.com/article/5-facts-about-stock-buyouts-that-may-surprise-you-cm217964For example, the Dell deal.http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131029006453/en/Dell-Completes-Go-Private-TransactionWhether you (as a minor shareholder) agreed with the buyout or not, your share got sold for cash. Nothing to see here. Of course Loaded's coins trace back to other addresses. He bought/sold/traded coins, so his coins will have all sorts of taint. Market cap of crypto is a totally meaningless statistic. This isn't like a public company, where the market cap is approximately the price to buy the entire company. You cannot buy all the bitcoins. Mine was printed on a laser printer, stuffed in a waterproof baggie, put in a waterproof pelican case, stored in a fireproof safe. So many reasons, but I'll mention just one. Hysteresis. With a couple lucky blocks, fork A could become the majority, then a couple lucky blocks fork B could become the majority. It would be chaos while miners switch back and forth between forks to try to stay on the winning fork. Whoever bought down at 1300 is looking pretty smart right now.
Time to switch to mBTC. Get your cheap coins under $2! I love your perspective. +20% in 3 days is "small". Done. And isn't it beautiful! Done. Gold down, bitcoin up. Correction, bitcoin is available under the MIT license. It is not public domain. We're up over 30% in 30 days. We're ripe for some profit taking. So true. On my home network, I can upload 1MB blocks to 10 peers in under 10 seconds. With 10 minute blocks, that's about 1% utilization for a consumer internet connection. That's not how hardforks works.And stop trying to steal my bitcoins. I own them and you have no right to take them away for any reason. It somewhat depends on what you consider micropayments. Micropayments were considered, but they weren't a focus of the design. Let's see what the designer had to say.Notice how Satoshi is considering .01 as an overly small micropayment. We got people today expecting to transfer .0001 around without paying fees. That's 100 times smaller than Satoshi's micropayment. It may change in the future, but as of today, it's simply not how bitcoin was designed. A bunch of $5 payments will end up with a reasonable fee. It's when you try hundreds of $.01 payments that you'll end up with massive fees. Bitcoin was never designed to be a micro-payment network. That is so not funny. It was much easier to mine them than buy them. I'm fine with that. Bitcoin can't be everything to everyone. If other altcoins grow up and solve different problems, that just makes Bitcoin that much stronger where it excels. Not a fact. Market cap is down for just 1 month. It's up from 3 months ago. Way up (nearly triple) from 12 months ago. The current banks take several days to settle an international transfer. Bitcoin does it in minutes. Why is Bitcoin not fast enough for you? That "main branch" is only for that individual project. They have no control over what people choose to run. Many users run Bitcoin projects that are unrelated to the Core project. Nah. Mining hardware doesn't really care how fast blocks are, nor how big they are. The limit was 32MB when I signed up. Bring back the 32MB limit. Lowering the time increases the wasted work, both with more overhead in blocks and in more orphaned blocks.
To a point, yes. Truly massive blocks would lead to centralization. Bring on the 10MB blocks. The network is not run on netbooks anymore. I'm holding out for parity with 1 satoshi = $1. Then we've won. I want 10x. Nah, a quick read of that message says to me that 0% is an accurate assessment. It would have to be Satoshi pretending to be someone other than Satoshi trying to be Satoshi. I'd give it a 0% chance. Buy, definitely. Bruce sure knows his stuff. I have them turned off. Such a better browsing experience. Every once in a while I don't log in and end up seeing the signatures again. It's a good reminder that having them off is a huge improvement.Look at it this way. People post hundreds and thousands of posts, but normally the signature is displayed every single time. No signature is so good that I want to read it a thousand times. There is no "official", but Bitstamp is the best previous ATH of 1163, so keep watching Bitstamp prices for new ATHs. /bigsmile It's time for a >2k rank.  There is money tied up in accounts and regulations that cannot buy bitcoin directly, but could buy a bitcoin ETF. 920 achieved. Up? How'd you make the list? I couldn't find a way to sort on activity. I think I might have secured 5th place. /flex The Bible is perfect. If you like what one passage says, you take it literally. If you don't like what it says, you take it figuratively.  Profit! As long as computing resources keep growing then bigger blocks do not pose a problem. If we ever reach a point where computing resources, including bandwidth, stop increasing, then it's a good time to stop increasing block sizes. Typically walls get pulled rather than eaten. It's in flux. About $350k gets you through that wall. Let's pump it! Click here: https://www.google.com/#q=bitcoin Like it or not, most international trade is done in USD. The US is by far the world's largest economy.
I find it funny there's no wall around 1163 @ Bitstamp. This could go way up. Why "always"? In many cases, divorce is a positive experience for both parties. Human beings are extremely complex creatures and constantly changing. Sometimes it's best for the marriage to end and both people to move on with their lives. 2013 was Willybot. No Willybot this time. This is quite different. From the OP: It won't. That's the point! An offline wallet is safest because it can only receive bitcoins. Eventually, it will be taken online, but until then, it is an offline wallet. Party like it's 2013. It's not enough to check the frequency. For instance, the sequence "1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3" has equal frequencies, but is unlikely to be random. Bitcoin continues normally. It's a perfectly valid occurrence. Is there a way to search by Activity? I'm guessing there's not very many of us with 2000+ activity. In case it wasn't clear, I mean a collision of randomly-generated keys. Poorly generated keys like brain wallets are prone to collision. That "when" is after the sun swallows the earth, at which point no one will be alive to see the collision. There will never be a collision. There were 2 significant events that caused large forks.Other than those, I have seen a 2-block orphan happen 8 times since 2012. I have seen a 3-block orphan only 2 times. No 4 or 5-block orphans, but we did have a 6-block orphan happen once. You have no guarantee that in 1, or 10, or 100+ years, that hardware wallet will still be functional. On the other hand, paper has shown it can survive thousands of years. No, difficulty adjusts after 2016 blocks. That depends on what you want to do. If you just want to verify a specific transaction, like when you receive a payment, you really only need to download all blocks that include all previous inputs. Then, any inputs that have been spent can be safely pruned. You only *think* bitcoin is anonymous. At least in the Android wallet, in Settings, you can put the IP address of your trusted node. You finally got it! A bitcoin node run on "3rd grade hardware in moms basement" runs perfectly well. There're a billion old PCs out there usable for running bitcoin nodes on. The cost? Virtually zero. Thanks for the laugh. That's like driving a Ferrari to your next door neighbor's house. OVERKILL. You can run a bitcoin node on a Raspberry Pi. It doesn't need server-grade hardware. A mobile phone is the wrong use-case for a full node. Mobile phones run on batteries and need to sleep as much as possible. A bitcoin node needs to actively process transactions 24/7. A mobile phone is a good place to run a SPV node. My SPV node uses 15 MB. It does everything it needs to.
A quirk in the original codebase. Why is the quirk there? That we don't know. Satoshi never mentioned it.http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/10009/why-can-t-the-genesis-block-coinbase-be-spenthttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nc13r/the_first_50btc_block_reward_cant_be_spend_why/https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9546a977d354b2ec6cd8455538e68fe4ba343a44/src/main.cpp#L1668 - Genesis block transaction treated as a special case in the reference code With 1MB blocks, the chain can grow up to 50GB per year. A 500GB HD good for 10 years worth of bitcoin data costs $30. That's $.01 per day. Yes, that is cheap and it keeps getting cheaper. Great, and do you have any idea how many IPv6 addresses are possible? You don't need a dedicated server to run a bitcoin node. Just slap it on an existing server for free. There're millions of servers out there that could be turned into nodes for no cost. I know, because I have one.And you underestimate the ability of people to exploit incentives. Let's say there is a real cost of $1 to run a bitcoin node. If you provide a $1.01 incentive, people will immedately spin up thousands of nodes and drain all incentives. So your incentive can never cover the cost to run the node which means any "incentive" is not an incentive at all. There's no change. Non-mining full nodes will always be virtually free to run.Transaction fees paid to mining nodes. We'll never run out of new blocks to be mined. The bottom line is this. The cost to run a full node is virtually zero. Therefore, your incentive available to give to the full nodes is also virtually zero. Anything above that will be greatly exploited. Yes, there is a "framework". It is very clear.https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidanceIt is taxed. No, the difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks so that confirmations will always average about 10 minutes. Bitcoin is cheap at only $.65 per mBTC. Radioactive decay is. Nope. Lost coins are lost forever. A wise newbie you are. We'd need a way to verify that these full nodes are really full nodes to be rewarded. We should find some way of having a full node perform some work to prove they're not just a fake node. Maybe they could perform some sort of mathematical computations to prove they're real. And then when they find the right solution to this mathematical problem, we reward them with, say, 25 bitcoins. I think this would work. People would love such a reward and so they will run lots of full nodes! Probably most, or they won't be a miner for long. With difficulty always increasing, miners need to be continually investing in new hardware. Big miners have low hosting costs, so most of their profit is going to be re-invested in hardware, and not much is going to be left for savings. Certain investors have money locked up in accounts that can only invest is approved things like an ETF. Raw bitcoin they couldn't invest in. This may or may not be a problem. Transactions are still extremely cheap, so blocks are filling up. But are those transactions that important? Are the blocks filled with mostly spam-like low-value transactions? I don't have the answer. Run your numbers with the new hardware (AntminerS9, 14 TH/s, 1500 watts) and reasonable electricity ($.05/kwh). Yes, because they're not storing thousands of copies of the data and transferring all the transactions thousands of times. The blockchain is highly redundant.Yes, that's fine now, because it's not storing worldwide microtransactions in that 75 GB. Worldwide microtransactions would balloon that blockchain millions of times that size. Try storing 75 PB on 7000+ nodes and see how expensive that is. Since day-1.Only by people who don't understand bitcoin. Every full node stores every transaction back to the beginning of the time. That's a horrible design for a worldwide microtransaction system.Someday the features may be added to bitcoin to support such transactions, but the current design is absolutely not appropriate. Until that day, bitcoin is designed for high-value transactions. 
Few people remember reaching "parity". That was pretty epic. Now look where we are, and we're nowhere near the top. Someone getting in now is still an early-adopter. That's how all altcoins go. We've seen it thousands of times before. There's an initial pump, then they fade into oblivion. ETH got it's pump 3 months ago. Since then it's been basically flat.Go away. Says the guy that cherry-picks when he posts a graphic.I might have made a typo. Here, check my work:Mar 15:BTC = $417.24ETH = .03076570 BTC = $12.8366806681000 / 417.24 = 2.396702138 BTC1000 / 12.836680668 = 77.901758707 ETCJun 15:BTC = $681.89 * 2.396702138 = $1634.287220881ETH = $18.49 * 77.901758707 = $1440.403518492Ok, not as bad. ETH is getting a big boost on BTC's coattails, but BTC still outperforms. The ETH pump is over. Go back to the altcoin forum. I'm so sick of you ETH pumpers. Go back to the altcoin forum.Here're the facts:$1000 invested in BTC 3 months ago = 2.396702138 BTC worth $1653.724475122 today.$1000 invested in ETH 3 months ago = 32503.729802995 ETH worth $867.371780912 today. Exchanges love pump-n-dump scamcoins. They make money on the pump, they make money on the dump. ETH has been flat for 3 months. The pump is over. Only thing left is the eventual dump. What are you talking about? You can rip them off. They can't rip you off. That's why you'll have a hard time finding a seller. He stated he's up 50%, that puts his buy-in point about USD 466/btc. +50% in 2 years is decent if you ask me. A true hodler. Pop! And now it's over $11 B. Which is a mostly-good plan. I disagree with this detail:When the price drops, buy back more than you sold. It's win-win! No Willybot! This is the real thing. 1 BTC is a wall? Maths. Death to bears! From the sticky: In the past, when significant problems arose, yes, bitcoin has been able to fork immediately. Blocks are not full, therefore, there is no immediate need for a fork at this time. If the need arises, it will be dealt with. Take your altcoin spam to the altcoin forum.ETH price 1 month ago: .0248 BTCETH price today: .0251 BTCSuch growth! And with the new higher-efficiency miners coming, the electricity cost to produce a bitcoin is about 10% of its current value. We're way above the potential price floor. This current rally is going to cause a lot of new miners to come online and drive the difficulty way up.
I still don't get it. Why would anyone waste any time calculating "median"? It's completely worthless. I'd be fine with the west taking us to 5000 CNY. So why are you talking about the median? It is a completely worthless statistic with regards to this topic. This. This rally seems far more natural. Forget the all-time high. That was faked by Mt. Gox and willybot. "median" is not a very interesting number when considering blocksize. "mean" is far more useful to estimate how many transactions are likely to fit in a block. The bank takes care of it by taking the money from the merchants, who now raise their prices to offset the fraud. You now get to pay higher prices for everything because credit card fraud is so pervasive. You think you're getting "protected", but really you're just paying for it up-front in fees and higher prices. No, it just means you're insane:There are several core principles that aren't going to change. 10 minute average block times is one of them. You can debate it all you want, but the result will always be the same. This is how Bitcoin works. Feel free to switch to an altcoin if you want something else. The whole thread should be deleted. Block confirmation time is working as designed. Use the search function and you'll find hundreds of threads saying the same thing you said. This whole thread is a waste of space. They could always withhold the block until someone else finds a block, at which point they can broadcast their block and hope to win the race. They would still lose sometimes, but sometimes they'd win. And that's it for May. It's so weird that you can avoid court just by refusing to get a lawyer. I'll let you in on a secret. Bitcoin has usefulness and value outside of simply storing it. You can actually do transactions with it! Yes, because we've seen the same thing happen with thousands of other altcoins over the past 7 years. They all "claim" to be superior, yet they all fail to overtake Bitcoin. Enjoy the temporary "pump" phase. Eventually you'll get hit with the "dump' phase. Bitcoin is working as designed./topic-closed I see what you did there. Bitcoins are never in a wallet, just the keys are. The keys allow you to move the bitcoins from address to address, but the bitcoins never leave the blockchain. The blockchain is in the digital world, not any specific country. Assuming all mined coins are soon sold. I wonder how long coins typically sit in their original address... So you think if someone leaves their car door unlocked too long that gives you the right to light the car on fire to prevent the car from being stolen? That's madness!No, you don't burn anything. Those coins belong to their owners exclusively and it's their responsibility to keep them safe. Not yours, not the community's, not anyone else's. Sure it does. By leaving it in place you preserve any potential anonymity. By always combining all your outputs you are linking addresses that don't need to be linked. Exactly. All bitcoins are vulnerable even today, just some more than others. Just look at the history of major bitcoin heists over the years. Sometimes the market takes a temporary tumble due to such heists. The responsibility to secure those bitcoins is solely the responsibility of said owner.
Consider time. A 1 minute old tx is far less risky than a fresh tx (assuming the rest of the tx is clean) if no double-spends on the tx show up.Also, you want your node to be well connected. If you only have a single peer, you are at risk. By that same logic, Satoshi's 1M coins should be destroyed right now. Don't you see how faulty your logic is? This "future situation" already exists. At any moment, his private keys could be stolen, or he could decide to dump all his coins. They are his coins. He should be the only one to decide what to do with them. That is a core principle that Bitcoin was founded upon. A reasonable assumption for a home miner, but miners aren't in homes anymore. Big farms pay much less than that. There's no misquote here.Nor here. Yes, that is correct. No, he's doing it to spam threads with his sig campaign. No, the US loves to double-tax foreign income. Fortunately, there are exemptions.https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Foreign-Earned-Income-Exclusion I do think that is unreasonable. If people don't want to move their old coins, that's their choice.I respect your choice to do as you wish with your coins. Stay the hell away from my coins. Don't you mean this one? Worst idea ever. Sergio's analysis. There're several posts on his blog to read through. The private key is 16 digits printed on the front of the card. There is no security whatsoever! Merchants have to deal with unknown customers all the time, therefore, they need protection against dishonest customers. Bitcoin solves this problem perfectly.On the other hand, customers can choose to deal only with known merchants. I have no worries about sending bitcoin to a merchant because I only deal with reputable vendors. Bitcoin works perfectly here too. No, it should not. The address is 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa. The genesis block coins are not spendable. All he can do is sign a message with the genesis block key. It would be extremely entertaining to see such a signed message show up. Satoshi has already spoken:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15139#msg15139 That is so choice. I can see Craig has a bright future as a Nigerian Prince. There was never any "might have been Satoshi". It was an aggressive attitude towards an obvious scam/fraud attempt. I for one am proud of the community in such hostility. WTG Team Bitcoin.Whoever can sign a genesis-block message will get huge support from the community. It's that simple. "early block"? No, not good enough! Any block other than the genesis block could have been mined by someone else. Gavin should know you can't move the coins from the genesis block, so the only option is a signed message from the genesis block.
Emphasis added. That part of his post is true. He cannot because he does not have the keys because he was never Satoshi. Well said brother, well said. Just got a big bag of chocolate covered coffee beans. Yum. Can't stop. I sure do, based on many years of having to deal with real scammers every day of my life.Correct. Independently verified or I won't accept it. Bitcoin has a verification method built-in. Use it or GTFO. SSS. Price goes up, I sell a little. Price goes down, I buy more back. Win-win. Obviously a rhetorical question, but I'll answer it for fun. Because it was a trick. I could easily create a bitcoin client that could fake signing a message. The thing is, no one else would be able to replicate it. Which is why it was in a secret meeting. Feel free to browse my extensive post history. I was posting here when Satoshi was still active. The goal posts have never moved. Sign a genesis block msg. Trivial for Satoshi to do and *everyone* can verify it.They were tricked. Have you never seen a magician? Do not believe the "proof" from secret meetings.If he wants privacy he shouldn't claim to be Satoshi. Claiming to be Satoshi is inviting investigations. The real Satoshi is smarter than that. He keeps quiet and no one finds him. No offense intended, but Gavin is a fool. He should to go Vegas and watch Penn & Teller shoot a bullet from a gun and catch it in his teeth. I'll let you in on a secret. It's a trick. Craig fooled Gavin.If it's not publically verifiable, it's a trick. No, the proof is trivial, but has not been posted. Sign a message with the genesis block key and post it for us all to verify. Anything less is simply a scam. Gavin emailed/chatted with Satoshi quite a bit, but never met in person. But Gavin is either a fool or has some other ulterior motive by not requiring a genesis-block signed message. Something else is going on. The real Satoshi would easily prove himself. If you don't see a bitcoin-signed message from the genesis address (1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa) then it's not Satoshi. I don't see that. Craig is not Satoshi. The miners will notice! Their income will drop in half. A lot of marginal miners will turn off their rigs. Hashrate could drop a bit. This. It's a sliding scale. As we near halving, the halving becomes more priced in. There won't be an instant price jump the moment the halving occurs. Up 100% since one year ago. Such a nice looking chart. There are over 400,000 blocks mined. You want to draw a broad conclusion from a single block? If you want to draw a valid conclusion, why don't you research historical block times? Cash will never be "mainstream". Someone steals your cash and you can't get it back. It's just too geeky. Normal people can't use it. Not concerning at all. Someone buys some bitcoins, then spends some, but not all of them, on Steam. That can only be a positive move since people can't spend more bitcoin than they buy. More places to spend them, mean more buyers, means choo choo. Correct. And it's worse than you can possibly imagine. I have a hundred examples. I won't go into details here because I don't want to give any scammers ideas. But I could easily chargeback any online purchase I've made. I can keep the merchandise and I get all my money back, at the merchant's expense. The credit card companies don't care because they've shifted the responsibility for fraud to the merchants, yet they refuse to give merchants the tools needed to fight fraud. Scammers love credit cards. Business owners love bitcoin! They no longer have to worry about fraud. Nothing! That's how it should be. Grow up. Take responsibility for your own actions. Stop counting on mommy to bail you out when you screw up. Every time you screw up, I have to pay for it (chargebacks cause merchants to raise prices). I'm sick of paying for your failures.
You take payments for virtual items that have no cost. Wow, so risky of you. Come back when you spend $10,000 on the raw materials for a real product and have the customer charge you back after receiving it. Online merchants shipping real products have no protection for fraud when accepting credit cards. That's why a credit card transaction isn't truly confirmed until months later, at which point it's too late for the merchant. They're already ripped off.In any case, comparing bitcoin to credit cards is the wrong comparison. Compare a credit card processor to a payment processor that runs on bitcoin like BitPay. With BitPay, you do get instant confirmations without the fraud risks or massive fees. You don't run a real eCommerce site, do you? I do. Credit card transactions can be reversed up to 60-90 days. All the customer has to do is say "I did not authorize that transaction". Bam, he wins the chargeback and keeps the merchandise. No one has ever reversed a 1-day old bitcoin transaction, let alone a 90-day one. As far as my node data, there have been only 2 instances of a reorg over 10 blocks, both due to significant unique events. 1 instance of a normal 6-block reorg. 2 instances of a 3 block reorg. 8 instances of a 2 block reorg. And lots of 1 block reorgs. 4 or more block reorgs are *extremely* rare. The standard client considers anything under 6 blocks to be unconfirmed. That seems like a good number to use for your purposes too. Standard PC running the default Linux client with basic cable modem connectivity. It's online probably 95% of the time, which would mean it could have missed a few reorgs. There could be an interesting story about that 6 block reorg. That does appear to be the biggest naturally occurring reorg. Extremely! This is closely related to the odds of pulling off a double-spend 10 blocks deep. D&T explained nicedly at https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1170/why-is-6-the-number-of-confirms-that-is-considered-secure.The worst was the overflow bug. That would have been around 53. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incidentMy node only goes back to 2012, so I missed out on the overflow fork. But I have the next big one. My node saw the .7/.8 fork at a reorg of 30:Code:Â  {Â  Â  "height": 225459,Â  Â  "hash": "000000000000036e459f26b1dc02683c9beeb061eedf18689995143354467245",Â  Â  "branchlen": 30,Â  Â  "status": "valid-headers"Â  }, Feel free to analyze my data at http://pastebin.com/LZxst5vD. Don't call it an "investment". There is no investing going on. It's a gamble, plain and simple. But you don't even know the odds of winning. You're just guessing. I'm having a real hard time following you. Are you saying with a strong telescope you think you could see across the Atlantic from New York to France? That's exactly how scams work. They pay people for a while, then they stop. Of course they returned that, they consider it to be worthless. Not hard at all. Fees are not required, so they can be adjusted on-the-fly without any sort of forking change required to the network. How would that work? Most transactions have a change-output, but you can't tell it's change.Take a 1 BTC input: Are you sending .01 BTC with .99 BTC change, or are you sending .99 BTC with .01 BTC change? There is no way to determine a correct fee. You want to send any amount of money anywhere in the world in just minutes, for less than $.04? Good luck designing that system. Such a reasonable request, it must be easy to do. The best one is the Genesis Block, i.e. 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa. The coins sent there can't be spent, but the key to that address can be used to sign messages. Wow, it sure does sound like bcp19 is back. Welcome back old buddy! Regulations...for the little guy...that's a good one! So Satoshi knew SHA1 was weak, so he generated 2 keys. He used the weak key publicly, and didn't use the strong key. How does that make any sense to you? Exactly. Satoshi went to great lengths to maintain his anonymity. We won't find him putting his anonymity at risk by attending Bitcoin conferences. You too can get a feel for Satoshi. Read over his 575 posts. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3;sa=showPosts Browse through Sergio's blog. He has lots of great details into Satoshi's mining.https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/satoshi-s-fortune-a-more-accurate-figure/ Sergio has done an excellent analysis of early mining. There is a distinct pattern to the early blocks that are virtually assured to be Satoshi's.https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/
It makes no sense for a trust to hold unmoved coins. There would be no way to guarantee that the trust is the only one with the private keys, and thus they would not be safely locked away in the trust. Emailing bitcoins? Huh? Great point. Wright just doesn't sound like Satoshi did. How about something like this? Miners send a portion of the mining fee to the nodes that sent them the transactions in the block they solved. That's the genius of their scam. With a possible real product, they are mostly safe from the authorities. With a token effort at producing a real product, prosecuting them becomes quite difficult. That all hinged on pre-order funds. Now that they can't accept pre-orders, they have no way to perpetuate their scam. There're lots of other kinds of fraud. From day one their MO was this. Over-promise and tie up pre-order funds so that customers couldn't get refunds and/or purchase competitors' products. We even have Josh on record admitting that the delivery dates being promised were impossible. That makes them thieving scumbags. There's still a lot of BTC at http://bitcoindf.org/. That'll provide many refunds. Refunds! No. You will never crack a good private key with today's technology. Never. Your loss.How to rip off chennan. As long as we keep bumping this BFL SCAM thread, I love you.  A fee per sigop sounds like a good plan too. Walmart, huh? No check fraud?http://consumerist.com/2015/08/18/couple-accused-of-pulling-shoulder-surfing-scam-to-cash-400k-in-counterfeit-checks-at-walmart/ The short answer is, "The earth will no longer exist by the time you guess a private key."Here's the long answer. If you find where those guys (don't forget Josh) start working next, let us know. Riiiiight.http://www.stopcheckfraud.com/statistics.htmlhttp://www.relyco.com/blog/laser-check-printing/check-fraud-statistics-techniques-know/ Old and very wise to the ways of the world.http://www.bestbuy.com/site/help-topics/payment-options/pcmcat203400050003.c?id=pcmcat203400050003 So? Checks can be forged, stolen, washed, etc. They're extremely unreliable. Why not? They accept personal checks. Those are far easier to commit fraud with than double-spending bitcoin.They can also use a service like BitPay for instant transactions. No name is needed. I use Frodo Baggins on my online credit card payments for my name (that's not my real nameÂ   ).
If BestBuy accepted bitcoin that situation couldn't occur. Been there, done that. I've gotten bitcoin refunds many times from many places. Even some BFL customers got bitcoin refunds.Do you never use cash? Cash is just as irreversible as bitcoin. Use cash responsibly. Use bitcoin responsibly. You're kidding, right? The claim that no one would have lost money is false. Many people that used MC/PP still lost their money. There are limits on how long you can reverse those charges, and BFL was great at say "two more weeks" which ends up being many months past the reversal dates.Those MC/PP "protections" come at a huge cost. Businesses have to raise their prices significantly to deal with the fees and fraud that come with using MC/PP. Rolling back trades seems ridiculous to me. But it's not just Gemini. It didn't take much searching to find even NYSE doing rollbacks on erroneous orders.http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-08-23/nyse-said-to-void-most-goldman-sachs-erroneous-options-trades So many great comments in this thread. Bitcoin is small and volatile. Trade accordingly. Like this: You mean this one that sells for $189? What a great deal!!!Anything BFL related is always a rip-off, new or second-hand. Not to rub salt in your wound, but even the very first reply to this thread question's BA's reliability to deliver. There were red flags everywhere with BA. As a couple people have mentioned, a poorly-chosen private key can be recovered. This includes some brain wallets and bugs in private key generation. Anybody claiming to be able to recover any private key is lying or he would have done so with any number of multi-million dollar addresses readily available in the blockchain. Nothing posted by the court. I suspect nothing happened. Eventually the judge might do something. Some of us really old timers are still around.  I can't get the Donate Bitcoins button to work. The page just greys out with nothing else showing up.Edit: Got it to work at jmwagner.com. Have a couple drinks on me. There's a small timeframe (5-10 min IIRC) where the msg can be edited without notice.Edited.Previous edit at 53:08.Edit: Ok, so the original timestamp doesn't change, but the text of the msg can change. Nice script! How do I add my personal info to said script so that everyone that attempts to post it is insta-banned? Well, they were wrong. Bitcoin has never been a ponzi in any way. Will the bar be accepting BTC? http://ia600704.us.archive.org/31/items/gov.uscourts.paed.489513/gov.uscourts.paed.489513.46.0.pdfJosh: "Sorry Judge, I don't want to hire a lawyer right now."Judge: "No problem, take as long as you need. Just check in every 90 days."WTH? Not even close. Minersource refused refunds to as many people as possible. Emails are not very secure. That email looks to match the doc posted at https://www.mtgox.com/. Sure, he can file a lawsuit, but it would be very costly and the odds of winning are highly stacked against him.
Good idea. Where is he hiding at these days? Speaking of fleeing the country, when are you coming back to the US to face the judge? The great thing about bitcoin is all that information is public. If you think fraud, double-spend, abuse malleability, etc. are important, you're quite welcome to write a node that analyzes those issues. Sounds like an excellent project. Can you say anything about the lawsuit? The docket hasn't been updated. Just ignore him. He does everything he can to defend HF and derail any thread that is critical of HF. I browsed the forum from a new machine, and as such wasn't logged in. Normally I have sigs turned off. Wow, I forgot how awful the sigs are. There is no use to having them on. They are a disaster. Code:$ ~/bitcoin-0.10.2/bin/bitcoin-cli getmempoolinfo{Â  Â  "size" : 59651,Â  Â  "bytes" : 112127725}Impressive, but not unexpected. Transactions have always been very cheap. I'm surprised this attack didn't happen before. That could be as soon as next year, which would be great. Fees are still under 1% of the block value, but after the next halving they could be over 1%. That might be enough. I think it'll just take another 2-3 halvings before miners won't be able to ignore the value of including transactions. Unfortunately, the days of the hobbyist miner are over. Large mining farms value short-term profit over blockchain health. Satoshi's halving schedule was a little too conservative. I'm looking forward to the day when mining income is derived mostly from including transactions. Miners/pools who create empty blocks on purpose are bad for the blockchain. That's how successful cons work. They pretend to be real. They turn off orders for a short time to sucker people into thinking it's real.If they are mining, there are many ways to prove it. They've never proved any such mining going on.Don't worry, they'll open up orders soon enough, long before they run out of profits. Um, they're just laughing you. It's like a drinking game for them. Everyone someone complains (and does nothing about it), they take a drink and laugh boisterously. There is zero chance of anyone getting a refund due to posting here. Bought for 216 btc, selling for 720 btc. Nice profit! I take it he and/or his lawyers didn't show up in court on 6/4/2015. +1After adding a few people to my ignore list, and disabling all sigs, the forum is so much better!Sigs are pointless. Just turn them off in your account settings. In fact, sigs should be off by default. If someone wants to turn them back on, that's fine by me. My servers are of a personal nature, so yes, I'd rather have the servers die with me than be hacked. For an organization, root passwords can be stored in a secure location, and known by a select few admins. I can see no reason ever for an ISP to have root access (unless of course it's a server with no real value).I've worked with DoD facilities. They would never pass root passwords to upstream ISPs. Unfortunately he made money from other victims. The scammers didn't lose anything. LOL! A server admin needs a mommy to reset his password for him? I'm sorry, but if you can't keep your root password safe, you don't deserve to be a server admin. No one ever needs to know the root passwords to my servers. No one. Ever. Is this normal for ISPs to have the sort of access that allows them to reset any server root password??? That is insane!!! I don't see any mining going on.
You mean after he is extradited? He fled the country long ago. You're right, I don't. Why don't you point out the rule specifying what info is prohibited?"Unofficial list of (official) Bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQ"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0 Since when? This forum is full of sensitive personal information. No, you funded a scammer and he will take that money to continue scamming. STOP FUNDING SCAMMERS, PEOPLE! ROI? Completely and utterly irrelevant. They do not sell ROI contracts. They sell 1-year contracts. They have never ever run even a single contract to the end! That means you have successfully fulfilled exactly 0 contracts so far. Congratulations I guess. If you have .15 to toss away, PM me. I promise to return some of your investment back to you at some later date. How nice of you to pick and choose which terms you keep.Queue cleared and no compensation. You call that a farm? My toilet has more miners on top of it. It's real, but don't click on links in an email. Type mtgox.com into your browser and go from there. Today is the day that reminds me how nice it is to live in New Zealand. What a shame. This was the only thread that was somewhat interesting in the Hardware forum. Nothing is going on in the hardware space atm. Yup, my Bitfury ran at .9 J/GH, delivered around Nov '13. They don't have any hardware. All their "contracts" are ponzis. Nobody mines there. If the miners are mining to a local pool, and the pool is connecting to the bitcoin network over satellite, then the lag will be minimal. Trying to actually mine over satellite would be awful. The foundation level just means BCS paid for it. The Bitcoin Foundation doesn't do any trust verification of companies.BCS refuses to provide any evidence that they are actually mining. By all accounts, they appear to be a well-run ponzi. Don't forget potential cooling costs as the northern hemisphere starts to warm up. I've turned off my .9 J/GH miners because AC costs eat up the rest of any potential profit. Difficulty is jumping up again in a few days, too. 25 every 10 minutes.Â   Great, let me know when he's gone and then I can consider your facility for my hosting needs.
You do get to inherit his bad reputation, which now spoils yours. Stay away from BFL products. They are too expensive, use too much electricity, are too slow, are prone to failure and leaking, and are from a company that will likely not be in business to support the product in a few months. You'll just be wasting your money like so many people before you. Over the last 5 years, Birkshire Hathaway has performed roughly equal to the DJIA and the NASDAQ. Extremely underwhelming for someone supposedly great at stocks. Thanks for the reminder. I've never seen a sig worth reading. I've turned all sigs off. Now where did I hear that before...https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=418183.msg5682450#msg5682450The parallels are quite canny. Anyone who thinks you have hashrate without proof is an idiot."long time"? Your ponzi has run what, 7 months? ROFLMAO. You do not have a "long time". We have lots of ponzi's that have been running longer than that. .5 J/GH miner, 1 TH/s, $.15/kwh:Daily Income: $2.87Daily Expense: $1.80Still quite profitable if you have a modern miner. So you don't have the hashrate. Ponzi. Definitely screwed. The time and cost to sue MS would likely cost more than the X1s. And then if you actually do get a judgement against MS, it's likely there's nothing left of MS and you'll never collect. The chance to sue MS was many many months ago. Sonny, is that you? You finally returned to BCT? Welcome back. How's that PBMining working out for you? While the final price is in USD, they also consider BTC ROI in coming up with the USD price. Doesn't matter. CMW doesn't actually have any miners. Hard to say what will happen in the next few months. As of right now, the S5 is the best miner that is sorta available new. Yet you won't provide that proof now. Why, because you don't have the mining hardware? You're the one who needs to prove you have actual mining hardware. You claim a bitcoin address would give you away, when nothing further from the truth. A mined coin has no history, and cannot expose you in any way. Prove you have the hashpower by showing your mining address and signing it to prove it is yours. Why wait? They're already lying. What more do you want? They are not legitimate. FALSE. Mining addresses do not reveal anything about you. In fact, the only bitcoins that have no history are mined coins. I can only conclude you are not mining. Josh fled the country. His lawyers quit because he won't pay them. I hope the judge comes down hard on him.http://ia600704.us.archive.org/31/items/gov.uscourts.paed.489513/gov.uscourts.paed.489513.38.0.pdf Why don't you deliver the compensation as promised? Did you ask any of your customers what they wanted? Did you ask if they wanted to wait indefinitely for some fictional future miner? Why do you hide the details of the compensation plan?
X-3, if it doesn't blow up, uses too much wattage to make it worth running. BA's claim of "fixing problems" has turned out to be flat out lies. "Power Consumption: 590 W (at the wall)"Yup, and the customers paid dearly for KNC's mistakes. You may think that's normal, but it's not. Bitmain and Spondoolies don't take 3 years to develop good usable products. POS mining also can show proof of mining. Where is your proof that you are POS mining?  Let's see what they say...A "mining" solution where there is no actual "mining" going on. Not so much a ponzi. More like a HYIP. FTFY. A better solution would be they lower the price back down. Perhaps they forgot. I will remind them.The queue has been cleared, thus the compensation must be shipped immediately. WHY HAS IT NOT SHIPPED??? Not gonna happen. The OP creates self-moderated threads so they can try to avoid their horrible history of massive failures. And where are all the compensation units? Ok, since you won't show proof of mining, ask the manufacturer of your equipment to confirm here that you have purchased a large farm from them. Jason thanks you for your gift. There's no mining going on at that address. Posting random bitcoin addresses does not show any proof of mining. Try posting an address that is being mined to. Good, that's what it looks like from my blockchain analysis. Not good now, but soon. I think we're going to see some good growth in the price this year. So you just jump early into every ponzi that shows up and cross your fingers that you win more than you lose. Glad that's working well for you. I have a guess which pool you are mining on. Would you state which pool you are using? There are several open source e-commerce sites that have bitcoin-related plugins available. You misunderstand the point of this thread. This is not a general risk assessment thread. It is simply 7 red flags. If you see these red flags, then the operation is likely a scam.If you don't see these red flags, it tells you nothing about whether they are a scam or not.This is the part you seem to misunderstand, so I'll repeat it. Make sure you understand it.If you don't see these red flags, it tells you nothing about whether they are a scam or not.
Look at this block:https://blockchain.info/block-index/814643Under Transactions you see:That's how you know those coins were first mined. Ah, well then if Bitpay won't do it for you, there are lots of other solutions. Good, I'll keep an eye on this. True, but aren't you using Bitpay to convert to local fiat? Feel free to accept bitcoins directly for any amount for any purpose you want. You can do that with bitcoin.But I can see how Bitpay doesn't understand the local laws in all countries. Keep trying to show them that you're operating legally in your jurisdiction. I hope they reconsider. If you want a quick and easy way to show transparency, simply publish the bitcoin address you are mining to and sign it to prove it is yours. He obviously fears bitcoin, quite likely because he knows he can't understand it. It's getting better. Really the only 2 companies left selling miners are Bitmain and Spondoolies. Both very good companies. 2015 should be a good year. Still waiting on that address. Nice find, but look carefully. "If" the order has not been sent. All the orders were sent to BA, so Matt gladly refuses all refunds. Take money from customers, receiver miners from BA, keep miners from BA, don't pay BA, don't refund customers. Money and miners for free for him. Perfect scam. My favorite use case is international sales. There is no existing fast, cheap, secure method of selling goods to international customers. Post a wallet address and sign it to prove that you are in control of the address. You claim to be actually mining. Prove it. Set your sights on a reasonable laptop and use gyft.com. Consider a Razer Blade: http://amzn.com/B00TB8X8GA. So where's your proof that you are actually mining? gyft.com is awesome. I use them all the time to buy Amazon gift cards. You get a code in email that you just enter into the Amazon shopping cart. So quick and easy. Well then you can just publish and sign one of your mining addresses. How about it? Seems backwards. I'm buying at these lows, and won't be selling until we go way back up from here. This is why so many of us speak out so loudly about all the scams going on. Help spread the word about these scams. When you see a new one pop up, help squash it. They don't have to pay them to customers. But if they are mining, they can prove it by showing the address and signing the address. Then they are free to sell the block for a premium if they want. So you see, there is absolutely no reason to hide the mining, that is, unless they aren't mining. Correct.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=418183.msg9742781#msg9742781"changed the formula" and didn't publish it. This was a shady operation from the beginning.
Logic. There is every reason to prove hashrate, and no disadvantages to doing so. This "company" has not shown any hashrate, therefore they are virtually guaranteed to not have as much as they claim. You're joking, right? At least I hope that's what the smilie face means.That "picture" is a image taken from the video at 4:46 and flipped horizontally. You know they don't actually have any mining infrastructure, don't you? Technically it does protect him somewhat. Like any good scammer, he changed the terms of the contracts. You can see the new formula here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=418183.msg9743464#msg9743464Payouts "C" are now whatever PBMining wants them to be. Anyone who bought contracts after that change are screwed.  Looks like about 100 TH/s of contracts. Why don't you post a valid mining address to show you have such hashrate?Edit: Oh, is that a weekly payout? That makes it only 14 TH/s. That might actually be a farm! Why don't you post some actual mining addresses? Wrong. Bitcoin is money. Bitcoin transactions are ways of transmitting money. Just like checks, bitcoin transactions have little value in themselves. The value is what they transmit. Congrats. You've shown that some early suckers get lucky and make ROI on a ponzi scam. Most won't. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=207.0Looks good. I wonder if there is a name for such a business plan... Are you referring to a particular ponzi cloud mining? I have yet to see these ponzis show any mining proof in the blockchain. Wow, stealing someone else's photos/videos. That's really scammy. Got any answers for my questions? The people asking for money should be the ones disclosing their identities. So your goal is to promote this ponzi so that you can make a profit off of other suckers investors. How much SHA mining capacity do you have? Can you show a mining address to support your capacity claims? Not really independently verified since Rossi was directly involved in the test. Name a single example. You can't. These scams always fail because they are scams. Not because someone asked for proof on a forum.Looks, it's very simple by bitcoin's very core design. Proving you have the hashrate is absolutely completely untraceable and anonymous. There is no reason not to prove you have the hashrate. Unless you don't have the hashrate. Very simple logic. 4 months out of 12 months contracts. You have yet to completely fulfil a single contract. Oh, definitely blame Jason, etc. Just don't blame bitcoin. Jason is the problem. Not bitcoin.
Seems so simple, yet none of the scams prove any hashrate, which is why proving hashrate is such a good indicator to scams. Disgusting they keep reading these threads but do nothing about it. Don't blame bitcoin for your own lack of due diligence. PBMining was called a scam from day one, but people didn't listen. "Close" is a relative term. They taped-out 20nm a whole year ago, and they're still shipping backlogged miners. 16nm is going to take even longer. Huh? 25 TH/s makes that much every hour. Is that what you're getting per hour? Be ready for huge demand. Current demand is surpressed by the low exchange rate. Next time the exchange rate jumps, you'll see huge demand for home miners. Why do you want to invest in a ponzi? You'll likely lose all your money. Only 6 posts and already on my ignore list. That's a new record! You need to ask Havelock. Was 2FA disabled? When was your account accessed, and was 2FA code entered? Easy, show us the ghash.io mining payout address. That's right, because it's not from mining. Ok miner from a bad company. Avoid Avalon at all costs. Not voluntarily. Find some police or a lawyer to help. Perhaps you need to research what a "ponzi" actually is.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme They might come back if they get enough new customers, so please, talk to your grandma and have her cash our her retirement funds and invest in terabox. Good list. Looking forward to seeing item #1: And how are the gift cards purchased? Cloud mining: High risk, low reward. Great way to lose all your BTC. Why are you using a Bitcoin Foundation image on your website? Of course it's a ponzi. Good luck.
40 Gh/s Mining PlanIncome: $.11/dayFees: $.08/dayProfit: $.03/day (77% of the income goes to fees)Cost: $15.60ROI estimate: 520 daysConclusion: No thanks. That's pretty typical. Very few people can get 1.7. That's good news. For the police to take action you have to actually file a police report. Who here has actually filed a police report? It's pretty simple. If you think you can make a profit, you are likely looking at a scam.Would you buy a 1 oz gold coin for $10 cash from a random guy on the street? You've gotten there by running a decent business. Keep up the good work and you won't have to worry about Bruno. It is a way for them to steal the bitcoins from people with very few bitcoins. I get a 3% discount when I use bitcoin. You don't get that much with your credit card. Businesses appreciate it also since their costs are lower and their chargeback risk is zero. Credit card fraud is crippling businesses everywhere.I use bitcoin to pay friends directly (smartphone to smartphone). You can't do that with a credit card. Yeah, I can justify them back on for a bit for some winter heating. This year-and-a-half price slump is getting annoying. I'm ready for the next moon trip. Web of Trust. It means the smart people around here understand that Terabox is running a ponzi scam and will eventually run off with your money. Looks like bitcloudmine.com is the newest ponzi scam. http://www.bitcloudmine.com/terms-of-business/https://app.mt.gov/cgi-bin/bes/besCertificate.cgi?bessearch=Bitcloudmine+Limited&action=list&submit=Submit+QueryWhy are you doing business in MT and not registered with the state.

No bitpay. No paypal.Nothing of yours checks out. That's a really good price!But let's compare it to hosting. You say about $1000 for 1kw system. Georgia gets about 1700 kwh per year, but you'll lost some efficiency for battery, etc., so let's say 1500 kwh, or roughly 2 months of power. You could host the miners at a bitcoin hosting facility for $180 for 2 months, much less if you agree to longer terms.You need to run the miners for more than 5.5 years without downtime to break even compared to a hosting facility. Good luck with that. Not when wired as a standard pcie connector. There are only 3 hot wires in both 6pin and 8pin configurations. Someone who had access... Do you really want to commit to losing money for the next 5 years in the hope that you may make a tiny profit in the distant future? Ack, no!!! Don't waste your time. There are no options outside of Bitmain and Spondoolies. None. Put the S5 at 1.3 TH/s, and the SP20 at 1.6 TH/s. Those are more realistic numbers. There is no such thing as "above ASIC". Already listedCode:terabox.meÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  1+2+3*+4+5+6+7*Â  Â  => 6/7 = Ponzi (pictures are not convincing to me for now, exit strategy involvesÂ  60+ days stall tactic)
Ok, that did it. Like this?http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/blogs/technical-blog/13098521-sp10-sp30-recovery-sd-card-boot-sd-card-creation-instructions I lost the login info. Is there way to reset the SP20 to factory settings? Yeah, that sounds like a great deal! Exactly! That's what shows how pathetic minersource is. They pass their problems on to their customers, rather than fix their problems. That's a horrible business and no one should risk their money on such a business. 565w at the wall is about 510w output. 510 x 2 = 1020w. 1020w is less than 1200w, so it should be fine at 375. Good chance you can even take them up to 400. Be sure to check the wattage after a day or so when everything has stabilized. When will you begin compensation shipments?  There is only 1 ROI worth considering. Bitcoin. If you can't mine more bitcoins than you can buy, then don't buy a miner. If you use a mail system like gmail, you can setup a seconary email that automatically forwards to your main email, and maintains your private personal email. There's the other way to communicate with you, but you're not taking advantage of it. The game is over. Every single customer that bought a contract lost money. Everyone. minersource is a crap shoot. How much do you like gambling? If you're lucky, you get your order fine. If anything goes wrong, minersource won't make things right. There are countless reports with them not shipping products, refusing refunds, ignoring support requests, etc. Roll the dice with them if you want. Do you feel lucky? The average rate in the US is about $.12/kwh, and that's not counting summer cooling costs, so yeah, it's about the same. But, the average home is very limited in power capacity, noise levels, etc. Sure, you can host a terahash or two, but not much more without a lot of effort. People still use CampBX? I thought everyone stopped using them ages ago. No site is 100% hackproof, so what's important is how well a site deals with issues. Bitstamp handled this hack pretty well, so I would still continue to use them. Quite possibly, which is why I wouldn't prepay for a five-year contract. But if I buy a one-year contract, I don't really care what happens two years from now. Next year when the contract expires, I can re-evaluate whether I think another year will be profitable.That I doubt. There's a high likelihood of a price spike in the next two years that will bring mining back into profitability, since the price can spike much faster than the difficulty can (bringing lots of miners online is much slower). My goal is to invest a set amount of fiat every month increasing my btc stash. I do that mining and buying. When mining becomes less productive than simply buying btc, the miners get turned off and I start buying instead. So now you end up with 2 threads on the same subject. Do you really prefer seeing 2 threads for every subject instead of just 1? They also emailed everyone. If you don't read emails from your exchange, you don't have much ground to complain. Do you expect some bitstamp representative to stop by your house and hold your hands?That wouldn't help. You can still send bitcoins to old addresses without ever logging in. Paypal definitely has its uses. They have saved many people from similar situations. Good thing you notified them before the 45 days expired. There are limits to the buyer's protection.Lesson learned, do not send bitcoins to people/companies/etc that you do not trust. And don't trust companies that have no history and are selling too good to be true items.
Request your refund asap. You do not want those devices. They use way too much power. You'll only lose money by turning them on! minethatcloud:Lasted about 1 week. Pretty bad ponzi. Can I get the "suicidal face palm" now? And now that they've stopped paying out, surely you agree it's a scam? And now minethatcloud is proven guilty by ceasing payouts, just like we warned you they would. So payouts have stopped? lol, that would be an awesome setup. You don't need water cooling to have quiet. You just need to stop designing for maximum density. Spread the chips out and use nice quiet slow big fans. That's really all water cooling is.If the SP20 was twice as large (same number of chips, without putting 2 chips in line of the airflow) it would run much better and quieter with 2 fans. Trying and massively failing.PBMining, 4284 TH/s should payout 52.2 BTC per day.The last payout reported from address 1Payu22kpAENfgDjazV4GUwVvQgEorDK4c was .76 BTC.They're continuing to pay out about 1%. .165BTC = 38EUR, so the additional income more than makes up for the additional power draw.

And when doing profit calcs, don't put the SP20 at 1.7 TH/s. Most people get about 1.6 TH/s out of it, almost no one gets 1.7 TH/s. Whereas the S5 is easily overclocked to 1.3 TH/s from virtually every unit. Now that the website is gone, can anyone confirm if there are any payouts still being made? Why is minethatcloud.com redirecting to your website? I think you meant to say something like "a portion of the past-due payouts". These contracts are still owed 4+ years more of pay-outs to come. Beyond any human's comprehension... Yeah, that's not going to happen. They have an obsolete design, and no way to fund development of a new design. BFL is finished. Extremely weak excuse. Take a pool like Eligius. The miners tell the pool what bitcoin address to mine to. There's no "account" to hack.Â  You'd have to hack the actual miners. If you can't secure your miners, you shouldn't be running a "cloud mining" operation.Cloud mining operations don't show their hashrate because they don't have it. 1 TH/s makes $2.44 daily income2.44 / .5 / 24 = $.20/kwh beak even point.Anything over $.20 per kilowatt is running at a loss.
Well that's new! Have you done any tests with lower voltages? That could really help people out if the efficiency can be improved. I'm not normally a big fan of escrow. Too many people have received boxes of rocks and then you get into arguments on what was shipped vs what was received. But in this case the delivery is publicly verifiable by anyone, thus escrow works great. So I'm reasonably protected from their scam by requiring escrow.If MineThatCloud can deliver 345 TH/s for 30 days, then it's worth 50 btc to me. They're selling contracts for half that price on their website. If they had any shred of legitimacy they'd jump at my offer. We can then conclude that they don't have 345 TH/s, and thus can't deliver, so escrow stops their scam.MineThatCloud is selling something they do not have, and are paying new customers from old customer funds. The best description of that is a Ponzi scam.Let me translate it for our "Belgium" MineThatCloud representative:wat moest bewezen wordence qu'il fallait dÃ©montrerwas zu beweisen war An offer of 50 btc is anything but silly and childish.That's how ponzi's work. They pay out at first, but then they fail. You will fail. The numbers prove it.Everyone can now see that you've refused a huge profitable offer because you do not have the hashrate you claim to have. Then you're lying. I'm not. My offer still stands, but it won't stand forever. MineThatCloud is online, but hasn't responded. Very telling.Both sides are publicly verifiable, so there's very little risk to each side. There are several trusted escrow agents that would be able to determine fairly if the contract was completed.There are risks to my side, but I won't describe them at this time as that would put me at a disadvantage. I'd like this to be a fair negotiation.Now answer my question. Is my offer fair or not? Excellent. Sign an address showing you have 10000 btc available to invest and we can work out the details. After a few minutes, any edits made to a message flag the message as edited. I will leave my previous message unedited. Feel free to quote it if you like, but it won't be necessary. If we need to change the terms of the agreement I'll post them in a new message so that we have an agreement based on an unedited message.Edit: enough time has passed, the previous message cannot be edited without anyone knowing. Feel free to quote it so I can't be accused of deleting it. I'll make another offer. One that everyone can see and can't be deleted by you and your self-moderated thread.I will rent your entire mining farm up to the claimed 345 TH/s (whatever portion is not already rented) for 30 days at double your current rate of .00087/gh. For 345 TH/s that would be 345 * 1000 * .00087 * 2 / 12 = 50 BTC. Of course, the payment will be escrowed by a trusted bitcointalk escrow agent and you will point your farm at Eligius with a bitcoin address of my choosing. I will post the bitcoin address publicly so that everyone can see it hashing away live. You make double the income and get to silence my criticism. Deal?Any pro-MineThatCloud people think this is in any way an unfair offer? I'd like to see it. I don't have access to the software. I clearly offered you 100 BTC.Because I already did so earlier. But, if you need to hear it a second time, I had nothing to do with your DDoS. Not only would that be illegal which I don't do, it would be stupid to use my own nickname in a threat like that. I'm way too experienced to make such a stupid mistake. Here is a complete unedited copy of the deleted message. Feel free to ask the moderators if it is true:Did you not know we get copies of the deleted messages? Caught you in another lie. Showing proof of hashrate does not uncover your identity. Failing to prove your hashrate is simply an admission that you don't have it. It's getting worse. Now the latest scam is using a locked self-moderated thread to bump their post back to the top without letting anyone else reply. This really should be stopped. I offered them 100 btc, but they deleted the message. If you read the trust system, you'll see "Risked BTC amount is money that the person could have stolen", which is true. Fortunately, I protected myself by proposing escrow, so their attempts at stealing my money failed. My trust rating for them is accurate. I'm sorry if they succeeding in stealing your money. Nice try sending yourself an email trying to claim it was from me. I'm still waiting for you to list your town of residence so I may report you to the police for illegal activities. I'll add the faked email to the list. Give me a break. Without bitcointalk they're a scam without victims. Just how I like it. Oh, look, icebreaker again. Let me guess, he's coming to the defense of CT. Icebreaker, defender of all the failed miners. Who's next on your list? Going to go defend BlackArrow next? MineThatCloud is leaving BitcoinTalk. Score one for the community. Thanks guys.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=924593.msg10192382#msg10192382 Low cost, but high reward. Not a bad idea. He should leave them off. He'll only lose more money by turning them on. So you're saying that you can steal people bitcoins because it's not illegal in Belgium. I'll let people know that's your plan.You are the one making claims, thus you are the one that needs to prove them.Don't you want to make me look like a fool? Post your mining address and prove you have 354 TH/s. Post your 2009 bitcoin address to prove you have been mining since then. Until then I'll keep calling you liar.
Yes, go back to your self-moderated thread where you can hide behind deleted posts. We'll continue to expose your lies here and there's nothing you can do to stop it. For running a Ponzi scam. We'll let the police decide."rediculously stupid"? LOL. If you're going to try to insult someone's intelligence, at least spell it correctly.I'm asking about whoever was making the 2009 claim. Prove it or you're a liar. Which town in Belgium? I need to contact your police to report you. Feel free to PM me the information.When your "private investor" runs with the funds the police won't be able to catch the thief because he's from an unknown country. How convenient for you.Let's continue with more MineThatCloud lies.http://www.minethatcloud.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16Prove it. Sign an address that was generated in 2009. Or at least post from a bitcointalk account that was registered in 2009. Speaking of foreign countries, why don't you tell us which country you and your "private investor" are from so that we can sue you when you default on your contracts? I'm not asking that the tool be removed, just that newbies be restricted from using it. They should earn the power to delete posts. I see no benefit from 0-day old accounts having the power to moderate threads. I've been here well over 4 years. MineThatCloud has been here 4 days. Who do you think is going to be here in 1 year?I honestly hope I'm wrong. It would be nice to be wrong once. But the math is pretty clear cut. The days of being able to host large-scale miners at $.30/kwh are long gone. I even offered MineThatCloud 100 btc. They just deleted the post.I was perfectly reasonable until MineThatCloud refused to answer basic questions and kept deleting every question I posted. They brought this on themselves. USD or Euros? The announcement lists Euros.So for 1 TH/s:Contract cost ($.43 * 1000) = $430Estimated cost of miner = $200That leaves $230 for hosting, or roughly $.05/kwh. That's pretty cheap hosting. Am I close? They aren't mining. They're just running a ponzi scam. Please don't bring that scam MineThatCloud into these discussions. Ouch, you hurt my feelings when you call me names. Now I'm crying. My mommy doesn't like it when I cry.Put up or shut up. You have shown no legitimate operations. Look at your trust ratings. Many senior forum members speaking out about your operation. Only 1 newbie account to defend you. You are doing everything wrong.You hide behind a brand new account. You won't show proof you are mining. You hide behind a self-moderated thread and delete lots of posts. Legitimate operations don't do these things. I will continue doing everything I can do damage you and your scam. Congrats on making an enemy. Will you publish the bitcoin address you are mining to? Never seen that setting. Got a screenshot? Quoted for posterity. I am 100% sure you will not receive full payouts for 1 year.I've shown that by using the absolute best numbers possible, they're paying out $1000 for every $500 they bring in. It's not possible for them to stay in business. They will fold before you finish your contract.You bought mining hashpower. You have never received a mined bitcoin from them. You received some of your own bitcoins back. You invested in a ponzi.Those of us who've been in bitcoin for years have seen this happen time and time again. You will learn the hard way. For your sake I just hope your lesson wasn't too expensive. Unfortunately by feeding these scams you are enabling further scams. And that's bad for the bitcoin community. I hope you apologize profusely when you lose. Read my cost analysis. Roughly it is this, for every $500 they bring in, they pay out $1000. Now you tell me how that is possible.My philosophy is when someone asks me for money, I demand some proof. Proof that is easy to provide by legitimate people. Why do they refuse? You can also give MineThatCloud negative trust: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=411711Be sure to select the "Negative - You were scammed or you strongly believe that this person is a scammer." radio button. So when someone buys a SHA contract, you don't actually mine SHA coins? Do you mine any coins?SP20s are the cheapest option. Ok, so you admit that you are using equipment that is more expensive and costly to maintain. Your losses are much greater than I estimated.You have shown absolutely no proof that you are legitimate, so I will continue shedding light on your scam everywhere I can. And what will you say when they stop paying out? Here's proof they cannot continue paying out.Let's analyse this "small loss" using the best numbers possible.Expense:Cost of 15x SP20s = $5,49515x PSUs = $1500Cost of power ($.26/kwh * 24 * 365 * 15 * 1.2 kw) = $40,997Total Expense: $47,992Income:25.5 TH/s mining ($60.5 * 365) = $22,08325.5 TH/s contracts sold (25.5 * 1000 * .00087 * 205) = $4,548Total Income = $26,631$48k vs $27k. They are running a massive loss, nearly double what the income is, not even counting the promotions, the free hashpower giveaways, website development, etc. The trouble is scam operators post self-moderated threads in the Announcement sections where regular users see them, and there is no way to criticise the operator. Posting another thread buried in the Scam section that no one reads is insufficient.Allowing new users to post self-moderated threads is a huge problem. I ran a lot of GPUs on Raidmax PSUs, and never had a problem. The multiple rails isn't that great, but if you're just going to power a single S5 it would be fine.Plus, they come in a cool reusable box. Can I see a copy of this "contract"?How do you calculate payouts?
minethatcloud.com is selling "cloud contracts" for less than the price of actual mining hardware. Legit?1) No mining address2) No endorsement3) No pictures4) Unlimited sales5) 7% affiliate plus hashrate giveaways6) Anonymous operators7) No way to sell the contract backCode:minethatcloud.comÂ  1+2+3+4+5+6+7Â  Â  Â  => 7/7 = Ponzi  Then answer my questions.What is your mining address?What business entity is running this service? What is your mining address? Time to turn some miners back on! 12-month pre-payment plan ($80/kwh), 2 TH/s:If you have the most efficient miners at .5 J/GH, income is $137/mo, hosting is $80, you are sitting at net $57/mo.If you have the average miners at .7 J/GH, income is $137/mo, hosting is $112, you are sitting at net $25/mo.If you have old miners at 1.0 J/GH, income is $137/mo, hosting is $160, you are sitting at negative $23/mo. This is my second time asking these questions. Please answer:Can you show your mining address to prove that you actually have the stated hashrate?What company and/or individuals are running this business? If you have the most efficient miners available, and have them underclocked for maximum efficiency of .5 J/GH, your 354 TH/s costs $33,000 per month at your least expensive facility. You are running at a massive loss right now.Can you show your mining address to prove that you actually have the stated hashrate?What company and/or individuals are running this business? They don't adjust voltage, so they're 1 J/GH at all clockspeeds. Noise-wise they're quite loud. Did you get your 1.8 BTC .pdf yet? They're the ones claiming to be "the most professional". I'm sorry, but you're not "the most professional" if you don't even have a business structure.If they change that to be "a guy in his mom's basement pretending to be running a mining operation but really it's just a ponzi", then at least it's accurate. He is HashFast's biggest cheerleader. Even to this day he defends them nonstop. Putting him on ignore is a very wise choice. I think most people have higher electricity/hosting rates than that, so underclocking will be even more important. Ok then answer these simple basic questions:1. Show the bitcoin address that you are mining to so we can verify you have actual mining hardware running.2. Show your business registration.3. Where are your Terms of Service and Contract details? That's the great thing about HF. If the price goes up, they refund USD. If the price goes down, they refund BTC. Windfall for HF no matter what happens. C7 is the name of the data center (DC). They're an expensive traditional server hosting facility. An absolute horrible choice to host miners there. The difficulty increase combined with the price drop has me turning off another batch of miners. How about you? Uh, why? No one is going to pay these prices for these old machines. I love MinerSource. They have the perfect business. They take pre-orders, receive product from suppliers, but then keep both the money and the hardware! Now that's some serious profit margins! Being a "real company" is about .0001% of what you need to develop a working bitcoin ASIC, not to mention the worlds best ASIC by far. In other words, being a "real company" is nothing.What we know so far is that it is impossible for them to release the product as specified at the time specified. You're crazy if you think they'll meet those specs.
That's positive? What, do you have free electricity? There is no evidence it exists, but that doesn't stop people from wasting their money.  Remove the plastic sides, lay them on their sides, and zip-tie them in a stack. What's hard about that? Running the SP20s that slow is an expensive option. That's some really impressive numbers!  I think you figured out the new recovery program. Jason is going to give customers lap dances. I concur. The key to maximizing efficiency on a limit watt budget is to limit the max voltage. I set mine to .63 to stay under 700 watts at the wall. You could go up to .64 or maybe .65 depending on conditions (PSU efficiency, intake temps, etc). Did you get any real info out of him, or did you just chat about the weather? Interesting. Although you'd probably need 4 of them per S5. You missed this part "+ $10/miner/month administration costs.". They're already not worth turning on. I get it now. BA was showing negative for me since I left them negative trust. Good work OgNasty. It depends on who is in your Trust List. Go to your Trust Settings and check:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trustIf you just have "Default Trust" in the list, BA should show as Negative Trust. Today you can get miners for $1000 that generate $10/day, ROI in 100 days. Crypto isn't dead. KNC is just a horrible company. Exactly! Not enough new customers to support payouts to old customers. That's the only supply chain they had. He only came back because his real identity was revealed, which means he fears the police/lawyers getting involved. Without that revealed you can bet your last satoshi he'd be long gone. Bump the max voltage to .79 and get it some cold air. Yes, the stock fan is quite loud, but it maxes out long before the ASICs register 60C, so unless I do a fan mod the high temp is not the cause of the noise. The heatsinks themselves are barely 50C, so I'm not worried about it at all. Of course there's no "official" contract. This was a "business" run by a novice with no understanding of how to run a legitimate business.But being the wise scammer he is, he quietly changed the details and deleted posts to hide the conditions promsied.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=418183.msg7692696#msg7692696Emphasis added.
I haven't seen any problems overclocking mine to 400M in a 40C room. Not true. Contracts were sold with a specific payout formula. He is no longer adhering to the original payout formula, therefore he is violating the contracts. Sissy. 375 @ 68C for 30 hrs and counting... Very rough numbers because everything changes, $150/mo income, $50/mo hosting, $500 purchase price = 5 months with static difficulty, 6 months if the difficulty rises slowly. Definitely, but it requires low electricity/hosting costs. Where have I heard that before? Oh yeah,  Yes, you do. For the last few weeks you have been stealing from your customers. You have 3 options.1. Buy Bitmain miners2. Buy Spondoolies miners3. Spend $10,000,000 USD to build your own.I'm guessing you can't affort option #3, so spend what little money you do have on Bitmain and Spondoolies. 15A circuit, 1300W PSU, 2 miners living in perfect harmony:Ebony (Overclocked S5): 1240 GH/sIvory (Underclocked SP20): 1140 GH/sEach miner is drawing 700 W (+/- 2%) at the wall. I'm going to tune both S5 and SP20 to 700 watts each, and see what performance they get. I haven't seen anyone get the SP20 that good. It's more like 650-700 watts for 1.2 TH/s. Yes, it comes preconfigured to grab DHCP. Haven't tried, but the numbers look fine. You should get both at least at stock speeds, maybe even a little overclocking. The FTC was not able to completely shutdown BFL. Other than that, the FTC has already won 4 major victories:1. Shutdown BFL for long enough that other companies have far superior products available for immediate purchase.2. BFL cannot take pre-orders ever again.3. BFL must provide prompt refunds to anyone who asks.4. FTC's lawsuit against BFL will continue.BFL's product is uncompetitive. They have no way to fund new products. BFL is finished. Celebrate! My review is at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=908126.0. My 750W Bronze rated PSU has plenty of power for maximum overclocking. Yup, that does it. Yeah, I can't ssh in with root/root either. I'm happy with it at 400M. Any higher starts getting hardware errors which doesn't improve performance. Noise is comparable to SP20 (both systems all stock hardware).So far all my testing of this S5 is with the same 750W bronze PSU. Only 1 change - adjusting clock speed in the web UI dropdown menu. The dropdown lists speeds up to 500M, but I really don't expect it'll go that high. That would be over 1.6 TH/s!Once I find the limits of this configuration, I'll try a platinum PSU to see if there's any more headroom for overclocking. Overclocked to 400 MHz and still stable:Ambient: 40cASIC temp: 69cBoard temp: 75cPerformance: 1320 GH/sPower: 775 WEfficiency: .59 J/GH (low efficiency Bronze PSU)Over 1.3 TH/s easily achieved!
2014 was a dream for Ponzis. With the skyrocketing difficulty running a Ponzi was a money printing machine. Every week the payouts dropped and profits increased. As soon as the difficulty levelled off, Ponzis started dropping like flies. As long as the exchange rate stays low, there will be few people buying miners, and difficulty will stay level. If the exchange rate skyrockets, expect the hashrate to also increase, making Ponzis popular once again. Most likely. Overclocked to 375 MHz. 1 hr in:Ambient: 40cASIC temp: 69cBoard temp: 75cPerformance: 1250 GH/sPower: 730 WEfficiency: .58 J/GH (low efficiency Bronze PSU) With a temp gun I'm reading about 75c on the back of the boards (the side without the heatsink). My S5 is running in a 40c room. The chips are right around 60c and working perfectly. 60c seems quite cool, so I don't expect any issues at that temp. I can hold my finger on the heatsinks just fine. Now that they have a good ASIC, I would hope they have a board in design that can adjust voltages. This would be a perfect setup for the S6. If you pay less than about $.15/kwh for electricity it's not even worth turning on. It's running great right here: Yeah, it's the same weird fan. Works great but sounds awful.12 hrs in and it is rock solid at 350mhz doing 1155 GH/s with 120 V and a hot room. There is no difficulty running this thing at spec as advertised. Temps running a very cool 63c.My SP20 peaks at about 1500 GH/s under the same conditions. To an untrained ear I would say they are comparable. The S5 has a higher pitch. Didn't you go from a Platinum to a Gold PSU? You should expect slightly higher power draw with the Gold. Both miners have 4 power connectors. The SP20 can draw significantly more power per cable. Bitmain also offered me an S5, no strings attached. So here is my initial review.Setup was easy. Plug it in and turn it on. DHCP grabs an IP address. My router identified it as "antMiner". Hit the IP with the browser and configure the web interface for pool credentials. Username and password to get into the web interface were root and root.This new S5 is not quiet. The 120mm, 4200 rpm fan is loud. But sitting in a 40c room, the ASIC temps are reporting 62c, so it's looking nice and cool.After running for an hour, it settled into:Miner Speed: 1155 GH/sBTCGuild Speed: 1145 GH/sPower: 675 W (750 W Bronze PSU)Power consumption is a little high due to the cheap Bronze PSU. Switching to my Platinum PSU should reach the advertised 590 W.Initial opinion: Good efficiency, easy setup, meets advertised specs.After some further testing I'll offer a comparison with the SP20. A superior pull configuration only works in the case is fully sealed. The S5 is not sealed, so a pull configuration would be horrible on it. Go with 80% for continuous operation. 15A x .8 = 12A x 110V = 1320W or 12A x 120V = 1440W. That should work if you have closer to 120V. If you really have only 110V, you'll need to limit the SP20 to more like 700W. You can trace payouts coming from payins. What more do you want??? I'd be very surprised to see Josh show up in court. He's got the cash from not sending people miners. He'll just pay his lawyers to sit in court for him. Are you sticking with a Pull configuration? Have you tried switching to Push, or Push+Pull? Yes, it's good for the community to have at least 2 decent manufacturers.
Mostly true if they're all rated the same. If not, for example, 2x 750 Bronze PSUs will be less efficient than a single 1200 Gold PSU. That is choice. HF's biggest chearleader, now claims HF was "an extremely risky bet". You are one fucked up individual./ignore Here's a really simple question for you:How long does it take from the time you tape-out to the time you get wafers? I'll give you 10 BTC to drive to Poland and check them out! Impressive. Got a screenshot of the ASIC Status page? And that's the problem. You're at the design phase. You cannot ship a working miner in 2 months from now that comes anywhere close to the specifications you are claiming. Too late. You haven't taped-out and you aren't in wafer production. You have no idea what the final specs will be, and there's no chance you'll ship in February. Selling something you cannot produce is what we call a scam. Let me pour some gas on the fire...Let's start with $4k for 2 TH/s if someone ordered earliest. They promised matching performance. Current performance is about $.4/ghps. That means they have promised to ship at least 10 TH/s per order (more for people who paid more than $4k). That's not even counting the fact that the Prospero is hugely power inefficient and most hosting would cost more than the income generated by even turning it on. The RockerBox chip is designed as a 200 GH/s chip, and there are 8 in the SP20, so it really is a 1600 GH/s miner. Yet they refuse to answer basic questions like this: The FTC will continue with its lawsuit. In the meantime, BFL will start to get back to business with 2 main changes. 1, no more pre-orders, and 2, prompt refunds. The Monarch product is no longer competitive, so anyone who has an order and doesn't request a refund is an idiot. BFL will get no new customers, because they are banned from taking pre-orders, and they cannot develop a new product without the pre-order cash. Yes, the formula was posted on the website. PBMining has since removed the formula, then started reducing payouts by adding in "other factors" after the fact. Edit: Nevermind, had my values incorrect. That might be the problem. Your watt meter is wrong.Look at the board wattage: 81+85+81+89 = 336Wall watt meter: 307Your watt meter is reading lower wattage than the boards (which are after the power supply losses). In other words, your PSU is 110% efficient. I need to get me a lot of those PSUs!!! Funny how you ignored my message. The first reply in this thread. Let me quote it so you can see it again.I'll make it longer for you. You are not the first to release a 20nm ASIC. KnC was. Months ago. Your claim is a flat out lie. Something so simple and important as that being a lie tells me you are full of lots more lies. No you aren't. Can you show the full ASIC page and the wall watt meter? But he's not running it in a cold room. His intake is around 30c. How did you go from 427 watts @ .625 volts to 321 watts @ .6 volts??? Talk about OVERCLOCKING.
You get the most fiat by having the most bitcoins. Always calculate your ROI in bitcoins. It's about time for PBMining to announce the classic "We've been hacked!" It's too bad you had to resort to deceitful advertising. This was a good deal without fudging the numbers.You cannot get .5 J/GH and $.295/GH. If you run this at .5 J/GH you will be paying over $.6/GH. Bad, very bad. I was running .9 more than a year ago.Edit:Here's the numbers for 1 J/GH per 1 TH/s:Income: $4.30Expense: $3.60 @ .15/kwhOnly 16% of the income is left after electricity costs. While it could hurt, it is an exhaust fan. Far less dangerous than an intake fan. That's an impressive failure! Most businesses are able to satisfy at least 1 customer! 0% success rate. Wow. I'll ask this again. Can you name a single customer that received everything they ordered, including MPP? The S5 does have a clear advantage for some people. The fan noise. Some just can't deal with the SP20 noise. Payments to old customers were made from payments received from new customers. That's the pure definition of a ponzi. That's not the at-wall wattage. Sure, they're both horrible, but BFL started taking pre-orders well before BA did. No, when the temp starts getting too high, it downclocks. In fact the default settings are too high for most people and it downclocks for just about everyone. The manual settings are really there for when you want to slow it down on purpose, such as using a small PSU or maximizing efficiency. Super easy to type it in. Hit the miner's webpage and adjust the "Maximum Voltage (0.580-0.790)" down a few hundredths. The noise is significant, but I don't mind it because I don't stay in the same room as the miners.  Exactly. SPTech has been aggressive on price drops lately, putting them at the forefront of quality and price. Too bad the current exchange rate makes ROI difficult. Do people still fall for that scam? I think that W value is at the chip level, so there's lots of other losses between the PSU output and the chip input that aren't shown. The 4 wattage numbers up top are closer to the PSU, so add those up and /.86 gets my at-wall wattage. That's your defense, they wasted all their money so they shouldn't have been sued? LOL! They sold numerous batches of machines, but ran out of money after shipping part of 1 batch. Monumentally incompetent people running that business. From the screenshot, the wattage at the board level is 152+153+153+173=631. At the wall it'll be more like 700-750 watts, depending on PSU. These reviews were planned more than a week ago, all out in the open. If you didn't want separate threads, etc. why didn't you say something before they were all posted?
HF should have thought of that in January and paid those refunds. And February. And March. And April. HF caused this situation. Not the lawyers. Only if there's an connection out to the Internet. It could be setup on a local net before connected to the Internet. Go to settings and turn off "Send device data to Spondoolies-tech.com (enabled by default)." Yeah, they're great when underclocked. Ok, my intake is about 40c, and exhaust is about 80c, so the back chips are getting +20c air. It significant enough that they are downclocked 200 MHz as a result of the hot air from the front chips. With better cooling you get better efficiency and lower noise. The problem with the SP20 is the unequal cooling of the chips. The second set of chips gets hit with air that's +40c hotter. Cool them with ambient air and you can lower their voltage and increase the efficiency. Let's go with $50. I'm pretty sure a better cooler would get at least 100 GH/s better performance. That's $12/mo extra. You make up the difference in cost in 4 months. Better performance, better efficiency, lower noise, longer life. At $50 it's an easy win. That heat pipe setup is nice. The regular 5970 passes the air across both GPUs:A heat-piped SP20 would be great. It's more the layout that's the problem. The airflow passes over 1 chip and goes +40c, then it passes over the other chip and goes another +40c. The second chip is baked by the first chip. What in the world are you having to babysit? I torture my SP20, and it needs no care at all. Have you seen the difficulty lately? Obviously very few people are buying miners. The exchange rate crash has really slowed hardware purchases. Go to the ASIC Stats page. There you will see what is happening. I grabbed slot #9.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=896913.0 I received my review unit from Spondoolies on Monday. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=887807.0 As noted elsewhere, the unit was packed nicely. I appreciated the all-cardboard packaging which is fully recycled where I live.EnvironmentSince I'm cold blooded, I like my place warm. Really warm. My old BitFury miners also love the heat. Let's see how the SP20 fares.SetupMy Antec HCP-1300 Platinum 1300W PSU was ready and waiting. Most PSUs have a color coded mb connector wires, but this one has all black wires. I grabbed what I thought were the right two pins and plugged in my paperclip. Lights come on and the SP20 connects to the network. Must be the right two pins, right? I surf to myminer.io and see my machine up and running. I click on it and go to the Pools page and input my pool credentials. But the miner just won't mine. It's only using 4 watts and the supposedly loud fan isn't spinning. It finally occurs to me that the paperclip might be in the wrong pins. I switch to the right pins and this time the fan lets me know I found the right pins..TweakingMy BitFury miners are quite tweakable, but it's very difficult to do so (adding/removing cards, editing config files). But their modularity and tweakability allows me to maximize my hashrate per electrical circuit. While not modular, the SP20 allows very easy tweaking of voltage and power. Here are the results. All tests at 100% fan and 40c intake temperature.VoltageWattage at wallGH/s.657101240.7010051468.7511101520.7911501534Since my PSU is more than sufficient, the limiting factor in performance is the temps. The SP20's single exhaust fan just doesn't move enough air when in a hot room. Half the chips get hot air from the other half, like the old dual GPU 5970, so they get clocked down significantly. I wish there was also an intake fan on the other end for a nice push-pull configuration. This would also lower fan noise, although noise is not a concern for me. A half-size SP20 where the airflow goes over a single set of chips would also work well.SummaryThe SP20 excels in quality construction and ease of setup. Provide a good PSU and turn it on. It'll adjust itself for maximum performance, even in a hot room. Â Later when efficiency becomes more important, lowering the voltage will come in very handy. Recent price drops by Spondoolies make the SP20 one of the best buys in the market. How about posting links to all the reviews in the initial announcement here? I wouldn't worry about that. Bitfury has good history. The key will be pricing. Naming a chip PMS is just asking for intermittent trouble. You'll need to provide some proof of actually mining. Mine a few blocks and sign their generation addresses and post the signatures. So what does your electrical code specify for the maximum continuous load on a 40 amp circuit? Interesting. Tell us more. Do you suggest running a UK 40 amp circuit at higher than 80% continuous load 24/7?
You can trace incoming payments from old customers to payouts to new customers. That's what a ponzi is. It's that simple. Almost. You shouldn't run a circuit above 80% continuous. So keep your 40 amp circuit at 32 amps or less. 32/5.8 = 5x S4s. Yes, if you hit the right IP address with a web browser it will prompt you for username/password. LOL. I paperclipped it wrong. It was actually getting a little power, but not enough. Now it's booting up for real. Mine's not mining. Current firmware version: 2.5.33.Events: The S4 and SP20 are actually more power efficient as well as cheaper and more reliable. It wasn't just a guess. From the minute PBMining announced their contracts, many people ran the numbers. It was virtually impossible for them to fulfill those contracts honestly. The only solution was if they were paying old customers with funds from new customers. That's the simple definition of a ponzi. And yes, a ponzi is a scam, no matter where you went to school. Buy some bitcoins. They're at a really good price right now. Large dies are very hard to power and cool. Just compare the companies and die sizes and you'll see a very strong corelation.Late CompaniesBFL: Large dieHF: Large dieCT: Large dieKNC: Large dieOn time companiesAvalon: Small dieBitfury: Small dieAsicminer: Small dieBitmain: Small dieSpondoolies: Medium dieIt's pretty clear that the companies that tried big dies has the most delays. I do agree the Asicminer dies could grow quite a bit and still work well. A typical room can handle a single SP20 if you have 120V power (US), two SP20s if you have 240V power (EU).The PSUs can be regular computer power supplies, the kind that gets used in a regular tower computer case, although for the SP20 they need to be pretty high-powered. There was no catastrophe. There's nothing to recover from. He's a scammer that is worried that he'll go to jail. That's the only reason he's doing anything. Was there even a single customer that got all of what they purchased, including the MPP machines? FTFY. Getting the PSUs is pretty easy. Providing all that power to all those PSUs, and keeping the temperature in the room cool, that's the question. A regular household circuit isn't going to be enough for that many miners. heheOf course, if he had asked, should I buy or mine, I'd have given a different answer. Miners are good for the network, but at this time they are rarely the most profitable way to earn bitcoins. Remember, always calculate your profitability in bitcoins. The answer is very simple. Don't do business with sketchy businesses! I buy things online everyday, and have never had to dispute a charge, because I don't buy from people that everyone else says is running a scam!Bitcoin is more comparable to Dollars, not Credit Cards. When Bitcoin becomes successful, Credit Cards will offer the same benefits for Bitcoins that they do for Dollars. Possibly. You still need to know the ratio of silicon to other system parts costs. If a $100 miner is made up of $1 worth of chips, and $99 worth of other parts, doubling the cost of the chips only makes the miner cost $101. Unfortunately I don't know how much the raw chips cost to know if it significant or not relative to total system cost. The silicon could be a significant portion of the total system cost by now. It didn't used to be. That's close to the best choice on the market at this time. Do you have enough power and cooling to handle it? Yes, you are correct, that was the one I meant. I will edit my earlier post. Here's how you tell. If you can not point the hashpower to any pool of your chosing, then it is most likely a ponzi.
Acutally, you should. You are asking people to send money to you first, and to trust you that you will deliver later. You are the one asking for trust, yet unwilling to provide it. You are in the wrong.Send me 1 "Zeus v3 Miner", and if it meets specs, then I will pay you for it. Please don't waste your time/power/money/etc. mining SHA256 with an R9. It's pointless. Yes, you were fooled by them. Nearly every cloud mining scheme is a fraud. Stay away from them. So why won't you even show a single mined bitcoin? Is February when you hope you'll have some equipment to mine with? If you don't get paid from newly minted coins, you should assume they do not have the hardware anywhere. Ok, at exactly what BTC price was the full BTC refund clause valid? You can show that, can't you? Or is the price restriction just a figment of your sick imagination? That's turning out nearly as bad. A lot of people sent their chips to Technobit 5 months ago and still don't have their orders. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=682105.0 Filing a small claims lawsuit in Colordao is done online and costs about $100. If you live far away, the biggest cost would be attending the court date as that has to be done in person. Phone calls, emails, all those they can (and do) ignore. Lawsuits they can't ignore. If you just ordered an X1, then yeah, you're kinda screwed. But people with X3 or larger orders would make sense. Sorta like a group buy. You buy a pallet of miners, then sell them individually for a small markup. Both Spondoolies and Bitmain have bulk orders for sale. I know I'd pay a little extra to know you already have it in stock and can fire it up immediately. Prohibiting empty blocks is worse than pointless. If empty blocks were prohibited, fake transactions would be created and permanently bloat the blockchain to get around the limitation.Each block, empty or not, increases the security of every previous transaction. Sounds like a good thing to me, don't you think? And how well do you personally vouch for the operators of Nexus Mining? It doesn't matter where they get their hashpower, if they are unwilling to provide answers to legitimate questions then they are not a legitimate business. They've already been busted on copying someone else's website. Let's see if you have what it takes. One question...Tabs or spaces? Simon and Eduardo got paid lots! Under what name is the corporation registered? Excellent. You verified they are legitimate. Therefore you can answer my questions:What is their actual business registration info. A search of https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpSrch.html shows no "Nexus Cloud Mining". Legitimate companies follow the law and register with their government.Why is a Canadian company using German law and the Munich courts for its "Mining Capacity Share Agreement"?Why does their Reset Password page say "Genesis Mining"? Uh, no you are not making money. They are sending you back a tiny portion of the money you sent them. You are very much sitting at a loss. If you are actually mining, then you have freshly minted bitcoins. Sign such a bitcoin address and prove that it is yours. This gives away no important information, thus you have no reason not to provide such simple verification of actual mining. In 2-3 months your payouts will drop to zero because this is nothing but a scam and it will collapse like all the others. Now you're calling Cara a liar. We're making progress! None of that precludes you from answering my questions:
Next time listen to me. Yes, and that's a good thing. More people using bitcoins will result in a higher price. The more they get sold, the more they'll be bought. More demand = higher prices. Yeah. The first is the truth. The second is your fiction. It's worth than fiction. It's a lie, because you're also claiming that if bitcoin went to $1, HF would have refunded 5100 bitcoins. We all know that never would have happened. They would have trotted out that email and only sent 51. Everyone knew bitcoins could skyrocket or crash. It's what bitcoins have always done. So they should have saved some bitcoins around, then there would be no additional liability. Since they never planned for BTC refunds, their offer was a empty promise meant to deceive customers into buying. Then answer my questions: Of course he ignored it. He was told it didn't matter. Only after the sale was made did HF retroactively change the terms of the sale. We call that fraud. Why is a Canadian company using German law and the Munich courts for its Agreement? Please provide your actual business registration info. A search of https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpSrch.html shows no "Nexus Cloud Mining". And now you wasted your bitcoins on a scam, so you'll have even less bitcoins. No, it doesn't. It's very simple. Point your hashpower to a public pool like Eligius or sign a newly minted block yourself. If you cannot demonstrate the hashpower, you are a scam. If any of your claims are true, then you've filed police reports. Prove it. I'm your worst nightmare.Businesses don't get to be anonymous. Whatever country you are really in has laws about how you register as a business. You claim to be in Israel, and thus should be registered at http://havarot.justice.gov.il/. Spondoolies is, registration #514948843. You aren't, so how you are doing "business" is illegal, and as such I will track you down and "pass on" your info to the authorities and have you shut down. You say you are in Israel. You are required to register with the Government. Please provide that required public registration. If you cannot, it proves you are a scam. Let's compare that to a quality offering.SP20: 1.7 TH/s for $695 (cooler included).So the HF is worth 695 * 1700 / 432 = $176. Let's say you can find a cooler for $26. The HF board is worth less than $150. 1 J/GH boards? Worthless. Less than worthless. You'd have to pay me to power them up. It is a ponzi scam because they use incoming payments from new customers to pay old customers. It is fraud because they aren't even paying out the correct amounts anymore. These are both well established facts. Your payouts are now based on "other factors". Factors like "PBMining wants to buy a new Lamborghini" means you get lower payouts. They already explained. They didn't like paying out the old rate, so they cut everyone's payouts.Assume the position... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdFLPn30dvQ Ever hear of Mark Karpeles? It used to be posted on the website but have since removed it so they can change the terms of the contract anytime they want.https://web.archive.org/web/20140719195343/http://www.pbmining.com/Oh, look, they removed that from the website also. Anyone who ordered a contract before that was removed from the website is being stolen from.
That's a start. What is the companyÂ’s name or its corporation number? All you care about are partial weekly payouts. Since you like getting paid less than 100%, how about you send me 10% of every payout you receive? Ok, so we've established you aren't mining. Maybe you can answer a simplier question. Where is your business located? I'd like to know where to search when you run away with the bitcoins. It has not been certified as a class action yet. You can find all the relevant details at the docket:http://ia600704.us.archive.org/31/items/gov.uscourts.paed.489513/gov.uscourts.paed.489513.docket.html No, you got robbed around 15%. If you have a mining farm, you will have freshly minted coins. Prove it. Show your mined blocks. PBMining has stopped sending out full payments. They are skimming the payouts. They are now absolutely confirmed as a scam. This one's for you.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBUL7epV4h4 Looks good. How certain are you on the opening date? What if you are delayed? There's only 2 worth considering:1. Bitmain has the price advantage.2. Spondoolies has the quality advantage. No surprise there. No mined coins in recent history. Ponzi. Good luck. Good idea. Let me check your website for your business info so I can have you served ... Well, that's pretty minimal results. Let me try the CA business search page ...https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpSrch.html?locale=en_CAPlease post your official business registrations:Corporate Name:Corporation Number:Business Number (BN): News flash: If you haven't filed a lawsuit, you aren't getting anything. Who's got a payout address? Let's see where they are getting their coins (because we all know they aren't mining). You mean paying out lower than promised payouts? You call that reliable? A made up name. Nothing about PBMining is real.  PBMining has confirmed that they'll adjust payouts to whatever they want whenever they want. They are a confirmed SCAM. Au contraire. They have confirmed that they will adjust payouts to whatever they like whenever they like.SUCKERS Less than $2995.
Excellent. I'd like to buy some SP35s below cost. Some interesting analysis on coin movements:http://www.coindesk.com/analysis-around-70-bitcoins-dormant-least-six-months/ You know the answer. If they aren't sending out newly minted coins, they aren't mining. Since the difficulty has levelled off, they're still profitable for BA to keep mining on them. Fascinating story! So what date did BFL start mining on live-net as a "test procedure"? So answer the question. What date did BFL start mining on live-net as a "test procedure"? So do you get a single payout for all contracts at once? Have you tracked their payout addresses? I think 1Payday1sm5wGqtatKscfXnxARZ2B2MF3z is one of them. I'd like to know how many contracts they are actually paying out on. 38,000 transactions would be half of all transactions on Sunday, so I have a hard time believing that stat. You mean this threat?Well done blackmail, Josh. Well done.#askftc Sent you a positive trust rating to help counter balance the BA crap. Why not for the next 5 years? That's what is being sold. And I bet you they won't be around in 5 years still making payouts.Fact: They claim to mix coins for security reasons.Fact: Mined coins have no history, and are thus completely untraceable.Question: Why do they chose to use an insecure method of payouts? Oh, you're here to provide facts? Here's a fact I'd love to know the answer to:http://ia802308.us.archive.org/32/items/gov.uscourts.mowd.117531/gov.uscourts.mowd.117531.166.1.pdfWhat date did you stop using test-net and started mining on live-net with the burn-in testing? It's getting there if you have expensive electricity.Antminer S3+, $210 USD, 450 GH/sincome = $2/dayelectricity@$.15/kwh = $1.25/day.I'm not growing my farm now, but the income and spare heat is quite nice this winter. What's to say? They took in payment from this weeks new customers, and sent some of them to old customers. Nothing has changed. It's still a Ponzi. No, but now you're seeing the fatal design flaw with designing big fat hot chips. It's extremely hard and expensive to provide adequate power and cooling to big fat hot chips."Fastest bitcoin chip" is like having the "biggest gas guzzler". It's not a good thing. Again you're completely wrong. Let's look at the number of components on a HF board.That's a hell of a lot of components (many of them very expensive).Compared to something like an Antminer:Very few components (all inexpensive). I hope you have facts to back up that claim. You're confusing size with density. "GH per chip" is size. "GH per mm^2" is density. Density means you get more hashrate per wafer. Size of the chip is meaningless. "hashrate per chip" is a useless metric. In fact, it's worse than useless. The "big" chips are the least successful chips. The "small" chips are what has been successful, for good reason. I'll let you figure out why small is better. Unless the customer agrees to an NDA as a requirement to receiving the refund.
What is he wrong about? Rather than prove they are legitimate, which costs them nothing, they spend on advertising, referrals, promotions, etc. It's so obviously a Ponzi! Not really. MS is simply a reseller of BA hardware. BA screwed up, which put MS in a bad position, but MS has chosen to make things worse by denying refunds, uncommunicative, etc. Name:Â Â Â AMT_minersLast Active:Â Â Â October 30, 2014, 08:47:02 PM BM1382 isn't a very efficient 28nm chip. If they do come out with a new chip so quickly, it'll probably just be a more optimized 28nm version. Tick Tock. Wow, I didn't think anyone would surpass BFL's incompetence. Congrats BA, you've finally bested BFL! Be serious. We know they had no capacity to ship all batches including all the MPPs. A few people might have gotten some hardware or refunds, but plenty more would have ended up with nothing. Now everyone has a chance to get something. In your dreams. Neither. You need to consider future bitcoin value if you have to pay for hosting(and/or electricity) with fiat. Unless of course you pay for lifetime hosting up front, or have free hosting. If you pay for hosting with the bitcoins mined, then it becomes really easy to calculate ROI. That is unless he ordered a 918. Quite true. If Bitcoin had been patented it would have been a total flop, and thus no alt-coins would have been created. +1. I much prefer direct payouts, and it eliminates a lot of your risk. The IRS has ruled that bitcoin is property, and thus theft of bitcoins is illegal.Invalid comparison. Your bitcoins stored in a paper wallet in your safe are just as safe as your cash. Most of my BTC spendings do receive discounts. Is it safe?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP-Nlb549J8 Actually, that's about the price he is currently paying due to credit card fees, it's just hidden so he doesn't know he's paying it. Always bet on ice? Have you filed a lawsuit? At this point that's likely your only hope of getting a refund. The ad from the video is claiming .09 for an existing miner. It's obviously not true. They spent all that time trying to get their "dud" of a board working. They eeked out enough refunds and working boards to finish up batch-1 end of March.
One of the cheapest hosting for these is toomim. Monthly plan is $198 per X3 (2x $99). Monthly income at current difficulty is $300. These are barely net $100 per month profit. You'll be lucky to earn a few hundred bucks for a total ROI of about -95%. MPP was due 90 days after delivery of the miner. HF started delivering miners in late Dec, which would mean the MPP should have been started in April. In March, HF announced delays to the MPP deliveries, "expecting" to start in June. Obviously March and April are before May, so HF was already in violation of the MPP by the time the bankruptcy filing occurred. Impressive imagination again. Let's see the truth:http://hashfast.com/official-update-on-the-miner-protection-program/Oh, look, the MPP isn't "just chips". It's been 4 1/2 months. How's that "pull out" working? Sound like a fatal design flaw. There was a 32 MB limit to messages (which I assume still exists), so 32 MB is the max it could simply be raised to right now without further code changes. Breaking blocks into multiple messages would be a significant code change to go above 32 MB. I don't see how MS can be legally selling devices without any US certifications like FCC. Some people want everyone to run a full node. I'm suggesting that's not a good idea. We should not limit bitcoin growth such that everyone can run a full node. Not everyone needs to run a full node to benefit from bitcoin. Which is proof they're a ponzi. Yes, mixed coins are hard to track. Actually mined coins are impossible to track. They have no history. Mixing is proof they are not mining as much as they say they are. I'd rather not implement a grandma-cap on bitcoin's growth. Grandma doesn't need to run a full node. She can use an SPV or other thin client. Now that's a great idea! Eliminate all verification and security from the blockchain. Anybody can create any transaction they want, and they'll all be included in the new "fair" blockchain. Sweet excuses. "adverse business conditions". "early missteps". If they had a "superior product" they would have met their target dates. They failed, which proves they have an "inferior product". If the ASIC was so great they would have been able to turn it into a working product and they wouldn't be bankrupt. All they did was design a novelty chip. Then Bitcrane should build them and sell them from stock. Anything less is unacceptable. Any feedback loop can be gamed. You might as well just pick a fixed +xx% per year and be done with it. It's not free. The larger the block, the higher chance it has to be orphaned. No miner is going to inflate his blocks to reduce his chance to win a block race. Filing complaints is a nice start, but it has no real "bite". If you really want your money back, you'll have to file a Small Claims case. You cannot corrupt the blockchain. The hashes in the blocks make that impossible.The only reason those 2 people downgrading worked was because the majority of the miners also downgraded and verified that their copy of the chain was identical to the everyone elses. It only worked because thousands upon thousands of miners verified it as correct. Bitrot is impossible. But that's a very costly attack, yet it doesn't accomplish anything. Let me quote my own post and you can point my lies:Be sure to click on that URL and see if what I posted was in fact true. Waiting...
No, because that's where the mining process comes in. Every block is validated with the hashes. Any "rot" would invalidate one person's chain and someone else's copy of the chain would be used. +1Now it would be very expensive to flood the network. When there was no specified limit (the effective limit was 32 MB), someone could have flooded the network with junk transactions for virtually no cost. There are something like 10,000 copies of the chain. It would be impossible for all copies to have the same bit rot. Because you ripped him off. Numbers scare you, don't they. Let me make this simple for you.Buy Bitmain: Get more bitcoins.Buy bitcoins: Get more bitcoins.Buy HF: Get less bitcoins.More bitcoins vs less bitcoins. The choice is yours. You really wanna go there? Ok. Watch and learn.1x ztex: $1355 for 850 MH/s in Apr 2012. $1.6/MH2x Icarus: $1138 for 760 MH/s in Feb 2012. $1.5/MHIcarus boards were cheaper and started mining months in advance of ztex. Ztex was overpriced and late. Hmm, just like HF now. No wonder you like ztex.PS: A ztex board would have mined about 100 btc over its life. Had you purchased bitcoins instead you would have had over 200 btc. ztex again was the loser.PPS: GPUs were getting double the performance for the same price with plenty of resell value afterwards. That's who got all the bitcoins back then. Since you have no actual arguments, you must be conceding that I was right all along. Thanks. And to think I almost put you on ignore. You are hilarious! There's nothing "new" about Bitmain. They've done multiple generations of chips and shipped so many units you can't comprehend. No one does logistics better than they do. The few times they did drop the ball they fessed up and offered compensation. Which CE mark?Real one or the fake China one: And shouldn't a PSU in the US have FCC certification? Because you lower your profitability. But hey, if you've got so much money that you don't care about profitability, they go for it! You're the perfect HF customer. Unlike you, I'm an impartial potential customer. Sorry to break the truth to you, but Bitmain and Spondoolies have far superior products. You'd have to be stupid to pass them up and buy HF.LOL. The people who did buy those "on-sale Sierras" are the ones regretting it. Bitmain is shipping sooner, has better power efficiency, is lower cost, comes fully assembled. HF loses on all accounts. There's no intelligent reason to chose HF over Bitmain. That makes it a horrible choice. Then it's DOA. There's no place in the market for it. Oh, but it is that simple. A year ago they had a decent plan, but they just couldn't finish it. Now it's just a power hungry, obsolete, uncompetitive product. The fact is that HF is finished. It's over. Accept it and move on. Wow, now they're shipping incomplete miners?http://minersource.net/blogs/news/15011905-x1-x3-now-shipping-with-lcd-screensDoes anyone have the old power supply? Are these any different? Sorry cedivad, but the price is horrible for a low efficiency, pre-order, diy kit. Are you sure your BCT account wasn't hacked? And with a board they aren't competitive. Lose lose. The C1 ships in a few days. This HF unassembled pile of parts might ship in a month. That makes the HF offering way more expensive. BFL did.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=48863.msg588169#msg588169 Which bitcoin colo won't host S3s?
Liar. Bitmain products work just fine in a bitcoin focused colo. The Bitmain S3 is far superior to this risky pre-order crap. I hate "Up To" ratings. What's the guaranteed hashrate? What's the wattage at the wall on these? It's looking to me like a Bitmain S3 would be a far better buy. What's the case number? It became irrelevant when they couldn't build a working miner out of it. I'd guess they're simply pulling the green caps. Check when you get yours. Without any update from BA, I highly doubt that MS has new power supplies. You call this "disclosed"? So what you're saying is, the promise "if you buy Baby Jet for 51 BitCoins today and it does not ship, you will be refunded the 51 BitCoins you paid" was a flat out lie? I agree with you! And I've explained to you, " (IE assuming the USD:BTC rate would remain constant)." is impossible, because the USD:BTC rate never remains constant, especially over the course of several months. The email, and other quotes from HF, were very clear. Your attempts to excuse their reneging on a promise is abominable. We showed an actual email from a HashFast representative that clearly states the full btc refund claim. Now show a quote that proves your claim.Waiting.........Oh, that's right, you're making up that claim. Fuckin Liar. Ok, good point, thanks.It would have to be a massive miner bloating only his own blocks he solves. Why would someone do that? It's a very limited and not very interesting attack as that is possible today yet doesn't happen. You're thinking of the current network. We're talking about a hard fork. A hard fork could require all transactions to have some sort of minimum fee included. I agree with Satoshi. You pointed out that free transations can be abused, so lets eliminate them when we adjust the max blocksize. And the rest of the miners are free to ignore a block like that. You have yet to convince me there's a problem. Miners can fill blocks with worthless free transactions today.Then maybe the problem isn't a large maximum blocksize, but the allowance of unlimited feeless transactions. They are not free for the network to store in perpetuity, so why not eliminate them?Eliminate free transactions and eliminate the maximum blocksize. Problem solved forever. Why is it not possible to get more than one update a month? What is so hard about communicating with your severely damaged customers??? Sounds like an irrational fear to me. Big centralized miners couldn't care less about little miners. Little miners are insignificant. And what are these big centralized miners going to use to fill up these huge blocks? Fake transactions? That makes no sense. Real transactions? Then there's a real need for such huge block sizes. From the wiki:To spam the 1 MB blocksize takes roughly .2 BTC per block, or 1.2 BTC per hour. That's only $500 per hour.To spam a 1 GB blocksize takes roughly 200 BTC per block, or 1200 BTC per hour. That's $500,000 per hour! A 1 GB blocksize is far more costly to attack. We could increase the blocksize to 1 GB now and nothing would happen because there aren't that many transactions to fill such blocks. Like what? What "new" attack vectors? It is already quite cheap to attack the current 1 MB blocksize. What would it cost to attack a 1 GB blocksize vs the current 1 MB blocksize? Right now a 1 TH/s, .6 J/GH machine looks like this:Income @ $410/btc: $180/moExpense @ $.10/kwh: $43/moThere's still significant profit potential at the current conditions. If all the information given in the FTC complaint is truthful, then there's nothing wrong with filing an FTC complaint. The FTC is interested in all sorts of complaints. What would happen if the blocksize were increased to 1 GB tomorrow? Pretty much nothing. Miners will always be able to create blocks less than the maximum blocksize.What would happen if the blocksize were decreased to 1 KB tomorrow? Bitcoin would come grinding to a halt.Too small blocksize = death to bitcoin.Too big blocksize = non-issue.I'd rather see the blocksize too big than too small.
The same way they tax the cash market. Lots of small businesses run on mainly untraceable cash, yet they still pay their taxes. Fear of penalties, jailtime, etc. You think it's funny that the FTC was given control of BFL in part due to the way you act here? You are seriously messed up in the head. https://web.archive.org/web/20111001053714/http://butterflylabs.com/I'll give you a pass because this was a BFL lie before you were hired, but BFL definitely lied about "manufacturing" the processor which they did not do. Another 2 weeks have passed. When is the PSU testing due to finish? Companies like Bitfury, Bitmain, ASICminer, Spondoolies, have done a pretty good job. They delivered decent hardware with minimal failures.Companies like Avalon, BFL, KNC, Bitmine, AMT, and many others have betrayed their customers. They had massive failures and their customers were screwed because of it.While the increasing difficulty means it's harder to mine, that also means that the network is more secure, and that's a key factor. Your bitcoins are safer, and their value will continue to grow. HODL. Good point. He might be warming up for running for office. Josh is so used to lying he cannot answer direct questions anymore. Avoiding, misrepresenting, flat out lying, it's all he knows how to do at this point. Don't you get it? No one here likes you or your employer. Use your own censored forums for supporting your customers. I like this line of thinking. What TPS are we shooting for and when? That's what will determine what size blocks we need and how to grow to that target.Simple growth rates like "50% increase per year" are guaranteed to end up with blocks that are too large, which will require another hard fork. Hard forks are bad, mkay? Not everyone reads BCT, but just about everyone uses Google. Make sure Google searches for AMTminers turn up the right threads/sites. So why did you buy a "no refunds" product in the first place? By that time KNC had a good history of failing to deliver. No one should be surprised they didn't deliver again. They do preorders so that all risk is on the customer. There's no reason to risk your own money when there are thousands of idiots out there that will risk their money instead. Oh, look, you're distributing cgminer binaries. Where are the sources? Simple question. When are you shipping the MPP? Sure, they have "real costs", but not everyone has to recoup them. Mining is also a way to accumulate coins, not just profit. For instance, I mine, and have significant energy costs, but I don't sell the mined coins to cover the energy costs. This is one way I invest USD to obtain BTC. Simple question. When are you shipping the MPP? Aw, isn't that cute. He cares about you! I don't think MS cares. Only 11 people have even bothered to file a BBB report, which only takes a few seconds to do online. I doubt anyone has even filed a lawsuit against them. Maybe MS have delivered or refunded most of the BA orders they took? Hey Dogie, sorry your thread got trashed by BFL. I'll report BFL trash to the mods. Hopefully they'll take a second and clean it up. You don't deserve this. Like I said. He won't answer the tough questions.
Ok, I lied. Now, why did you lie on the Monarch web page? And I'm waiting on the excuse for this:Inaba ignores anything tough. Or you can chose a respectable Bitcoin bank like www.circle.com which insures all deposits through Marsh Insurance. No artificial $250k limit either. We're seeing the effect of how the price affects difficulty. Low price has caused people to buy fewer miners and/or turn them off. My 2 J/GH miners are idle ATM until the price goes way up or I need some heat this winter. I never mentioned the tape-out issue. Now, on to the "28nm manufacturer" issue. Your answer? I'm talking about other quotes on the Monarch page that were left in place even when they were no longer true. I showed one example (there are many). Why don't you address that issue instead of avoiding it? Let's start with the claim "BFL is the only 28nm chip manufacturer on its 2nd generation ASIC." Why was that quote left in place during edits even when it was no longer true? LOL, you are so insane. You latch on to some little detail and fail to see the whole picture. We're talking about 2013 and 2014. It's not just about a "tapeout" reference. It's about lots more than that. How BFL leaves invalid information in place as a marketing tool. Big Fat Lies is the cornerstone to your business plan. It always has been. And as long as crooked people like you, Sonny, Nasser, etc are in charge, it'll stay that way. As I said, numerous edits were made to that page, while Big Fat Lies were left in place. Here's just one example.Sep 1, 2014https://web.archive.org/web/20140901161740/http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/Bitmain released their 2nd 28nm chip in July. Since I don't have the exact dates of the Monarch page updates, I'll just post 2 more that prove edits were made to that page after Bitmain released their 2nd chip.In Aug the old stats were there: https://web.archive.org/web/20140824162506/http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/In Sep the new stats were there: https://web.archive.org/web/20140901161740/http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/Conclusion. I win. You lose. Numerous edits were made to the page over many months, every time leaving in place "facts" that were no longer true. Since the people editing the page knew they were no longer true statements, and they chose to leave them in place, they became BFL (Big Fat Lies). I plan on living about 100 years, so looking at the daily ups/downs of any of my assets is just noise. My USD holdings drop several percentage points virtually every single year. For my bitcoin holdings, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 have been amazing years. 2014 is an outlier. Talk to me again in 2024 and we'll compare USD to BTC. Nah, the difficulty increases started slowing down in July, before those were delivered.Let's take a look back at when it started:Since the GB was opened, the difficulty increases have averaged 13.3%. 15% was a damn close estimate for more than a dozen difficulty increases.Your comment was based on JWU42's estimate:http://btcinvest.net/en/bitcoin-mining-profit-calculator.php?diff=6978842650&dcosts=4995&diff_mincrease=15&blpbtc=25&dhsmhs=5400000&diff_mincreasedecrease=0.5&btcusd=453.80&dpowcon=2500&btcusd_mincrease=1&pcost=0.115&calcweeks=32&dleadtime=9&action=calc#After 13 increases he estimated the difficulty would be 35.5 B. It is now 34.6 B. Great estimate JWU42! It's all in the KNC business plan. Every miner they ship reduces the income from their farm. Every miner that breaks down increases the income from their farm. Now that some Monarchs are in the wild, reports are coming in that they spring leaks. I hope yours doesn't leak. Good to see Bitmain getting some real support. It was desperately needed.With Dogie and Bitmain coming to an agreement about open criticism in other threads and Dogie's openness about the relationship, I'd tend to agree the conflict of interest is very minor. It'll be quite clear if Dogie continues to be impartial. Seriously? You're arguing that 8 months constitutes "a couple of months"? I'll show you the why you're wrong in the first point. You'll have to solve the rest of why you're wrong on all of them by yourself.* Rewards points are ~1%.* Using bitcoin at gyft.com gives you 3%.Winner: BITCOIN. Ah, good ole Loup. Still advertising bASIC in his sig. Yeah, psychopath is a more appropriate term. A "couple"? Two? No chance of that. Here's an optimistic calc with 10% and lower difficulty increases.http://btcinvest.net/en/bitcoin-mining-profit-calculator.php?diff=34661425924&dcosts=1450&diff_mincrease=10&blpbtc=25&dhsmhs=2000000&diff_mincreasedecrease=3&btcusd=413.24&dpowcon=1200&btcusd_mincrease=0&pcost=0&calcweeks=32&dleadtime=0&action=calcBreak even in about 8 months if you have free energy and have 100% uptime. If you pay for energy you never break even.ROFLMAO. That's what everyone said a year ago. Actually, he gets off hurting people. So when people cry on the forums he jizzes.
You can file a Small Claims Court online against MinerSource. If you have a single X1, then it's probably not worth it. But a larger order would be. Why do people pay .020+ BTC to earn .015 BTC??? Still trying to dismiss the FTC shutdown as simply a "persistent rumor"? Someone should #ASKFTC if they're aware that BFL is sending bitcoins from their EMC subsidiary. The FTC shuts you down, yet you still come here to spout madness. How do you plan to hide your employer on your resume? You are updating your resume, aren't you? Doesn't matter if it's a scam or not. It's horribly overpriced. There's no reason to buy it. None. Stop posting in their moderated thread. There's a non-moderated thread for that. Give it Two More Weekstm. And that's one of the reasons they were shut down. Those terms are illegal. Very much not interested at that price. Your company got shut down by the FTC. Too much speculation at this point. The currently low exchange rate and the rapidly increasing network difficulty makes ROI very difficult. Bitcoin exchange rate skyrocketing today. Looks like the market is very happy for this. That's the ticket. Sure, BBB doesn't have any real authority, but people have received refunds after filing BBB complaints. On the other hand, filing a complaint online is trivial. If you can't even be bothered to do that, no wonder the manufacturers aren't feeling pressured. No one follows through.BBB: file complaint onlineFTC: file complaint onlineSmall Claims Court: file complaint onlineThat's all very easy to do. Yet who has actually folllowed through? The manufacturers just laugh at you if you don't follow through. Looks like not many people care enough about their orders to even file a BBB complaint. Only 8 complaints filed.http://www.bbb.org/denver/business-reviews/computers-hardware-software-and-services/miner-hosting-in-denver-co-90167211/file-a-complaint Still just an employee. As much as I'd like for Josh to put on his big boy orange jumpsuit, he appears to have no ownership in the company and thus his liability is minimal. Fancy title means little. He had no authority to do anything. Sounds like BA/Minersource, right? S4 should ship a good deal sooner, and have lower power costs. So I'd guess about 2.5 BTC would be fair. You don't even need to visit to file a suit, you can file it online. You will of course have to visit when the court date arrives. Do you really think spamming big red fonts will get you your money back???
The only manufacturer worth considering is Bitmain, and they're in between batches. It shouldn't be more than a few days before the next batch is open. A generous way of saying it. Let me say it a little more forcefully. There is no way an FPGA will compete with ASICs. FPGAs waste a lot of silicon on programability. I get 1% rewards on my credit card, but I get 3% discount or more when I use bitcoins. I chose bitcoins a lot. Now one actual BFL employee will refute the rumor. What does that tell you? Cointerra's product is nothing but vaporware. No one needs to concern themselves with it. Good job dogie sending Inaba into a hissy fit. +1 to your trust rating! Difficulty update roughly every 2 weeks:14 days * 24 hours * 6 blocks/hour = 2016 blocks in 2 weeks. Exactly. Bitcoin is highly redundant. The source code is duplicated all over the place. There are copies of the blockchain scattered throughout the world, on hard drives, on flash drives, on optical discs, etc. Their estimate on when it will ship is 3 months wide. In other words, they have no fucking clue when it'll ship, and no refunds or compensation if they don't meet that monster window. Anyone pre-ordering that is an idiot. And that's where you're wrong. The world is going digital, something that never existed before. Gold can't compete in a digital world. Bitcoin can. Forget that and you'll pay the price. Uh, no. And you need to add in the cost of shipping. The S3+ includes shipping. The SP20 doesn't. Have you filed a lawsuit? It might be a fair comparison if the SP20 shipped immediately. But it doesn't. There's no comparison. SP20 is far less profitable. Previous batches had some waits, but the latest batch 9 just opened up and ships in 3 days. Nothing beats the Bitmain S3+. Batch 9 is available and ships in 3 days. While they do have some pre-orders, the bulk of their offerings are not. Nobody beats Bitmain's offerings right now, and the S3+ ships in 3 days. Nope. It was a flat out lie meant to deceive prospective customers into believing they'd get their BTC back if there were delays. Many customers would not have ordered if it were not for that lie. Let's assume you are correct in all of that. That proves the promise of BTC refunds was a flat out lie. In which case they would provide BTC refunds. Simon promised BTC refunds, when he really meant "We'll give you the smallest refund possible. If bitcoin goes down, we'll provide BTC refunds, if bitcoin goes up, we'll provide USD refunds."
Simon is no idiot. Of course he knew it was possible for bitcoin to skyrocket. He knew full well that the price of bitcoin could go up, making BTC refunds impossible. Promising full BTC refunds was therefore a lie. Because that's what bitcoin does. It has always been highly volatile.Then it was a lie to promise it. Simple. They lied to gain orders. Fine, I'll quote Simon. He confirms the same about of BTC refunds:Yes, I agree, HashFast was lying from the very beginning about BTC refunds in order to secure more pre-orders. Prove it. Show the statement from HF stating such a restriction. PROVE IT OR YOU ARE LYING. He won't be there. He likes to spend customer funds on advertising, but he's not the kind of person to actually show himself in public. Isn't that cute. He's spending your money. It is insanely priced.ASICminer tube. You get to fiddle a bunch, and earn back the bitcoins! That's one expensive hobby. Must be nice having so much money you can just throw it away for fun. It's takes a monumental scum of the earth to come here and taunt the people that you ripped off. WTG ASSHOLE. Assuming a 90% efficient PSU, you will be drawing 1160w out of 1389w, which is under 85% load, so that should be fine (assuming a quality PSU). There is no ROI for cloud mining. The only way you may pull a profit is if you sell your hashing shares to some other sucker. Granted, there are a lot of those out there. Apple names things whatever they damn well please. They don't care if the name is already in use. p2pool is better than solo mining. You get frequent payouts, you're in full control of the mining. There's nothing better. Shipping 10 days early. Way to go Bitmain!Now how about that price on B9? Again you're wrong. It was an official email from an official HashFast representative to a customer. Full BTC refunds were promised by official HF representatives. You continue to lie that they weren't. You have a very active imagination. Let's look at the actual wording.There is no way you can construe that to mean USD-equivalent. None. That is 100% clear. Full BTC refund. Recapitalization would require people to trust HF. Nobody trusts them, thus creditors take matters into their own hands. What do you call it when a company can't meet its obligations? We call that "bankruptcy"! When that happens, lawyers get involved. Shocker! This isn't some politician promising to end poverty and failing to accomplish that promise. This was a crucial term of sale. HF had no right to break that term of sale simply because it was "inconvenient" for them.
So the offer for refunds was a lie from the start. Thanks for admitting they were a scam from the start. SP20: 1.7 TH/s, 2.5 BTC, ships late Oct, shipping cost not included.S3: 1.8 TH/s (4x450), 2.3 BTC, ships late Sep, world-wide shipping cost included.The S3 will mine nearly 1 BTC before the SP20 even ships. That puts the net price like this:SP20: 2.5 BTC+shippingS3: 1.3 BTCThe SP20 is twice as expensive! Fact: Hashfast promised BTC refunds.Fact: Hashfast refused to honor BTC refund requests.Fact: Hashfast cannot be trusted.The correct course of action is to involve the lawyers. Everyone was offered full refunds when the actual shipping began. Even people with all sorts of upgrades. It's the one thing BFL actually did right. See, you keep getting it backwards. HashFast imploded long before the lawyers showed up. Without the lawyers, no one would be getting anything. With the lawyers, there's a small chance of getting something back. That is 100% HashFast's fault, and your fault for pimping HashFast so much. Scam for sure. PMs like that are always scams. Don't feel sorry for him. He could have gotten a full refund. He was an idiot to not chose the refund option. $1200 (>2.5 btc) without PSU due end of Oct. Disappointing price&date.  How can you show your face in here? Have you no shame? Do you feel good that jjiimm_64 got scammed for 210 btc? Even if they do tape-out, there's no way they can actually build a miner that works. They can't even build a 28nm miner that works. 14nm will be 10 times harder to build. I don't think we're going to see him in the States ever again. Since some X1s and X3s have been delivered, by both BA and MinerSource, where is the corresponding source code to the binaries that have been delivered? http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/333Fine Josh and put him away for six months. Sounds like a fine plan to me.Did you know that I can divide dollar bills without destroying them? Watch this...   Bam! One dollar bill into 4 pieces! For my next trick, I'll break a one dollar bill into 10 pieces! How about that source tree? The customers that received the miners deserve a copy of the source code too. Shit like this is what why you keep making things worse for yourself. ORLY?* Writing bad checks - illegal* Making death threats - illegal* Refusing refunds - illegal* Not delivering MPP - illegal* GPL infringement - illegal* Using another company's business name - illegalAnd that's not even counting all the lies which are technically not illegal but are lower than pond scum business practices. SP31 is about $.7/GH, so if the SP20 comes in around $999 I'd call it a decent deal (meaning likely to break even). At $10/day that's 100 days to ROI. Not horrible by any means, especially during the winter when the heat can be beneficial for a home. Ah, you got me there. He delivers lies, bad checks, etc. See, now you're just making shit up. That's why everyone thinks you're just a sockpuppet. 1st. There are plenty of other in-stock miners that are cheaper. 2nd. AMT has never shipped anything in under 5 days. 
AMT is a blight on the bitcoin marketplace. AMT doesn't need to get back on track. They need to get as far away from bitcoin as they can. But buying a 1200w PSU to run at 600w will cost you far more than you save in electricity. It doesn't matter if you save $30/yr if the PSU costs an extra $200. Always keep a PSU tester handy. I use mine all the time. Something like this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16899261023 Almost exactly what I was asking for:Sell it from stock (for the right price of course) and I'm in! Yeah, just look what you have to send them first.Extremely likely to be a scam. I'd recommend contacting Bradley Kuhn http://ebb.org/bkuhn/contact/ about the GPL violations. If he can't help, I'm sure he could refer you to someone who could. I'm pretty sure the price per coin won't stay this low for the next 40 weeks. Most "high density" hosting facilities max out under 10 KW per rack. A rack of SP10s is what, 40 KW, and a rack of SP30s at 60 KW? So yeah, you'll have a real hard time filling a rack of those in a regular facility. Soon, probably early 2015. Hosting fees are running 30-40% for a lot of miners. No. PSUs are rated on "output", and killawatt measures "input". Converting between the 2 is about 80%-90% efficient. Therefore, if killawatt says 400w, then the output is between 320 and 360 watts, which is between 64% and 72% load. Check your spam folder. They developed it so they could use it in their own mine. Which is only a problem because Spondoolies chose to design a system where the PSU had to be run at 120% capacity. Most other miners run at full speed on 110V. You wanna criticize Bitfury? An engineer that single-handedly designed a 55nm chip that is more efficient than most 28nm chips. Whose miners shipped on time. Whose company deals with venture capitalists instead of bankruptcy attorneys. Whose chip is powering a significant portion of the entire Bitcoin network . Go on, keep making a fool of yourself. No one said big chips are impossible. Just that they are fraught with difficulties, as proven by the fact that most big chips have had huge problems making working miners, while most small chips built working miners quickly and easily. Yes, it is easy. SHA256 is embarrassingly parallel. Making a big fat chip is just copy/paste. It's just a bad idea due to heat density and other issues. That's why companies that did big chips (HF, CT, BFL) had the biggest problems actually building working miners.  BFL is over 9 months late. BA is only 6 months late. You can't outdo BFL. They are masters of overpriced late hardware. I'd be much happier with a 2 TH/s 2U unit where you didn't have to run the PSUs at 110% and have to run them on 220V to get their full performance. 2 TH/s in 2U is plenty dense for any hosting facility. It's hilarious looking back and see just how wrong iCEBREAKER was:I think we can rest assured there's no second chip taping out in a week. To be clear, avatars are not disabled. Changing of avatars is disabled.
More power than an S3.More cost than an S3.Slower to ship than an S3.BFL has perfected the trifecta of shitty mining companies. Come on BA, you're right on track for unseating BFL for being the worst shipping manufacturer! The kind BFL always does. You would be a fool to skip the full refund option. Nope. It's a bad time to buy mining hardware. Hogwash. It doesn't matter what hardware is used for mining. If mining is profitable, then big farms will be built. That's how people think. If you can make $1 per day mining on a desktop CPU, then a farm will be built to mine $1,000,000 a day on a huge farm of desktop CPUs. We saw it in the early days of mining when botnets were redirected to mining purposes. Doesn't look like there's any diminishing...Not a Ponzi. QED. No one is ever receiving a refund. You either join the existing lawsuit, or file your own.  http://btcinvest.net/en/bitcoin-mining-profit-calculator.php What a stupid analogy. When a car manufacturer advertises 20 MPG, you can reach it by driving appropriately, and in fact you can exceed it quite easily. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-efficient_driving for examples.Now, show me how you get an SP30 to run at 5.5 TH/s while drawing 2700 watts? X1s are trickling out to customers who ordered from BA, at about the rate of 1 per day. X3s don't appear to be shipping at all yet. That's gotta be one massive turbine! Monarch compensation comes out to $2/GH. Anybody who doesn't request a refund is buying overpriced space heaters. At the current exchange rate, difficulty can go up about 5x before your costs equal your income. I'd estimate that'll be in about 1 year.I don't know the specifics of your order, but here is my best guess:http://btcinvest.net/en/bitcoin-mining-profit-calculator.php?diff=23844670039&dcosts=4200&diff_mincrease=10&blpbtc=25&dhsmhs=4500000&diff_mincreasedecrease=3&btcusd=506.17&dpowcon=3000&btcusd_mincrease=0&pcost=0.125&calcweeks=32&dleadtime=1&action=calc How's the power usage? Every other manufacturer is offering A1 systems running under .8 J/GH. How did the AMT system turn out? There are still far too many stupid miners. People are actually taking delivery of overpriced BFL hardware as we speak even though they are being offered a far more profitable refund option. Other people are dumping money into every Ponzi "cloud mining" website that pops up.  Big box? Did you order an X3? The promise is still on the website.https://www.kncminer.com/pages/faq Assuming 1200 watts and $.15/kwh that's $4.32 per day in electricity. AMT is busy creating more worthless self-moderated threads. So just try hooking up 4 cables to 1 ant.
Take a look at these quote from nearly a year ago:Go look at the network hashrate back then compared to now. Anybody predicting the hashrate is leveling off is going to look like a fool in a year. Just like those guys look now. Are you using all 4 pci-e power cables for each PSU and Ant? Sure, after difficulty goes up another 10x. You can't "keep the good hashes". Either you send them to the pool, or you throw them away. If you throw them away, you get nothing. Yes, you can do that, but it's a waste for you. At this point it's just an unboxing slideshow. Get part 2 posted with power, hashing, UI, etc. We just need the source code to cgminer that AMT is legally obligated to provide. Ask them for it. Customers have been ripped off for 9 months and now you want to rub it in their faces by offering a sick bet. I'll make you a counter bet. I'll bet you that the customers who ordered on the first day will never mine back the bitcoins they spent to order their Monarchs. Feel free to post a quote of someone saying that. Where were you in Nov '13?Where were you in Dec '13?Where were you in Jan '14?Where were you in Feb '14?Where were you in Mar '14?Where were you in Apr '14?Where were you in May '14?Where were you in Jun '14?Where were you in Jul '14?They're 9 months late and you're surprised there's hostility? You wait until they announce they're already shipping, and then you make a bet. Only a jerk offers up such a bet. That's hilarious. 9 months late! and now you want to make a bet. I think you're reading too much into the quote...Notice he didn't say "customers"? They've been shipping boards to their farm all along. I have yet to see a single customer report a tracking number or delivery. Are you sure you don't want to price these at market rates? Agreed. They've never had a valid business registration. Tracking them down is going to be difficult now that Josh has fled the country. What is the purpose of all those pieces of sheet metal? That's a good start. Now that you're distributing binary copies of open source software, where is the corresponding source code? That S2 is overpriced. Get a few S3s for less money and higher hashrate. So you're refusing to compensate for the missing J/GH? Grandma: not richhttps://www.goodreads.com/quotes/616685-diversification-is-protection-against-ignorance-it-makes-little-sense-ifBuffet: richI'll listen to Buffet before I listen to Grandma concerning investing. Only if you're setting up a single S3. If you doing any sort of farm, you're going to use server power supplies which cost maybe $10 per S3. Sorry, but that site is significantly flawed. For instance, it claims "* Prices do not include shipping or tax.", yet the S3 price does include shipping. Furthermore, "** ROI calcs assume static conditions for ranking purposes only." It's impossible to compare miners with static conditions fairly. I can't extract the file. Did you upload the entire file?
A 44 MB image. That's not a complete image. And how do you think they'll respond when your new miner dies 1 day after you release the escrow?Â  Why would you even consider buying an overpriced miner from a company with a long history of failing its customers? Just ignore this thread. AMT will delete any truth posted here (including this message). Hmm, that's going to be hard to beat. Can I interest you in a long vacation from BCT? All right, who's got the highest activity level? theymos at 1666? This proves Bruno's "leaked" chats are real. They sent systems without PSU on purpose. You ended up on their "naughty" list and got shafted. Don't worry, you'll get it. AMT *always* keeps their word.Â   Does AMT use cgminer? The S2 was much more efficient than the S1. If they repeat that design, they could hit 1200W easy. If they launched 2TH at 1000W they would clean up! Yup. Small-time/home miners are finished. The big guys have their startup costs paid for, and now they just crank out the chips at far cheaper cost than they will sell them for. There's no way to compete with that. Professional hosting is about $100/kw.SP30: $300/moS3: $350/moSo you need to run the SP30 for 20 months to make up for the price advantage of the S3. Good luck with that. .58BTC is only $266, or $.6/ghps. That is by far the best price in the market. No, because Bitmain prices the S3 in BTC. Currently the S3 is significantly cheaper. SP30 is a decent product, but Bitmain S3 is far cheaper with bitcoin prices at a low right now. The S3s would only cost about $3k when the SP30 costs about $4k. Nice try AMT, but deleting posts doesn't stop your illegal distribution of copyrighted material. You have been warned. Your business is finished. Actually, since they're refusing to refund customers, it's customers funds that they're wasting on lawyers. Ask your attorney what he thinks about your ongoing copyright infringement. Here's a starting place:http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html No kidding! Even BFL employees are requesting refunds. If you can't even sell to your own employees, who can you sell to? Unfortunately (for you), distributing binary open source software without the source code is a copyright violation. The copyright holders will be notified. Let's try again. Are you distributing open source software?
The good news is AMT is a US company. It will be quite easy to prosecute them for GPL violations. Hi AMT!By chance are you distributing any open source software in your machines? Nice try AMT, but it's hopeless. Which is it? Is it ready for shipping "right now" or "next week"? AMT's biggest supporter and they didn't even do you the courtesy of shipping you a miner like everyone else. That's gotta sting.  Hardly. Almost every hosting contract for miners is rated by power. Even for S3s. They promised Nov '13 shipping, and haven't shipped yet. Difficulty has increased over 20x. If they compensate with 20x hashrate then I'd believe Josh. Anything less and he's simply a liar. To be fair, that's an extreme case by running highest possible voltage. Very few people will be able to run their SP30 at 258V. Feel free to post efficiency at 110V. More bitcoins = more fiat.Less bitcoins = less fiat.The fiat price of Bitcoin really doesn't matter much...when calculating the profitability of an already purchased miner. Blaming the victims is really lame. Not gonna happen. Let me prove it to you.Take a look at when they "shipped". Now count how many days it has been. No one has received their miners. There is no chance you will receive a timely delivery. AMT just cannot do it.Reminder: This is an AMT-moderated thread. They will delete any messages that make them look bad.  This seems to be a very short-sighted cost-cutting measure. As someone who has mined for many years, running PSUs 24/7 at 100% capacity is never a good idea. Oh, I see the confusion in my wording. Let me rephrase it. "BFL is in control of the bitcoins that have not yet been donated to charities." What money back? You wrote IMET a bad check. deepceleron makes some good points. You can read up on other issues at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse. What trend is over?Consider an SP30, $4000, 4.5 TH/s, 3000 watts:Hosting cost at $.15/kwh per day: $11Income per day: $66Expect difficulty to continue to rise at least 6x from now. Actually, they didn't. All they did was create a website and sent some bitcoins from one wallet of theirs to another wallet of theirs. There is no non-profit status whatsoever to it. BFL, the for-profit company, is 100% still in control of those bitcoins. Didn't you say that a while ago?3 months later and what do you have? You have got to have the most patience I've ever seen.
Not a good idea at this time. Addresses should not be re-used. Oh, look, they can't answer the question. Yup, plug each PSU into it's own circuit and you'll be good. To reiterate what everyone else has said:* If you want to mine, get S3 miners.* If you want more bitcoins, just buy them. bobsag3 and marto74, what's the schedule for the next batch? When does the order need to be converted to chips, and when will the next batch of boards be produced? AMT delete bot hit... Now they don't even want answers to the questions they ask. WTF is wrong with those people? Ah, but taking money and delivering nothing is the ideal business model! "trusted" feedback is from people *you* have in your "trust" list. Typically that is yourself and a few admins here."untrusted" feedback is from the rest of the people."negative" feedback is in red."positive" feedback is in black. Aw, how cute. AMT continues to censor their thread ineffectively. Yeah, but when you order an S3, odds are they'll be delivered on time. Buyers here need to be aware that the odds of an on-time delivery from AMT is virtually 0%. When are the X3s due to arrive?  Doesn't matter. Customers ordered a product that they never received. HF fucked up. Don't try to blame it on customers, lawyers, trolls or anyone else. Yeah, you tell them! How dare they feel entitled to the product they paid for! If it wasn't for these bad customers and these bad lawyers, HF would have shipped everything in Oct when they promised. Bad bad customers! A thread moderated by iCEBREAKER. What a waste of bits. There is only 1. Bitmain. Shipped within a week, good price, good efficiency.https://bitmaintech.com/productDetail.htm?pid=00020140630025130637RV8OhOwt06BC Wrong. HF was unable to deliver the miners months and months late even without lawyers. There was no chance they'd deliver the MPP in any worthwhile form. Ever. Nice idea, but dropping the machine all the way down to 3.8 TH/s will massively hurt profitability. Which is why Spondoolies' $/GH current compensation plan is inadequate. Funny how you disappeared right when HF failed to meet their Dec deadline. Did you think everyone would forget about your HF shilling? You sure picked one big bomb to shill for. Xian01 has bought miners from many manufacturers, and I'm sure would buy from you if the price was right. You don't want to hear the truth, but the fact is your miners are overpriced.
Not enough. You also missed the promised J/GH rating. That directly ties into how long these machines will be run. Lower J/GH means they must be turned off earlier. Please consider this failure in your compensation calculation. You got it backwards. Gold should be linked to bitcoin. I have no use for gold in my day to day life. With bitcoin, I can easily buy anything I need, pizza, cars, computers, etc. With gold, I can hide it in a safe and that's about it. It's not easily divisible. It's not easily transferred. It's generally useless in day to day activities. The estimate of Satoshi's bitcoin holdings (980k) is based on analysis of the data in the actual blocks, not just some sort of address guessing. Bottom line, Satoshi was a persistent miner with significant hardware. He mined a lot of bitcoins which are largely unspent.http://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/satoshi-s-fortune-a-more-accurate-figure/ Once you accept delivery, that's all you're going to get. That's why AMT won't release tracking numbers or even any details whatsoever what is being shipped. Sign for that package and you're "whole" in their eyes. https://www.btcguild.com/index.php?page=pplnsIt's hard to find a recent time period where BTCGuild didn't have bad luck. AMT continues their hypocritical behavior. Calls a customer a "douche bag", yet deletes a post calling them the same thing. Search for any number of Dragon A1 miners. Like this one: http://www.bit-winkor.com/xproducts_view.aspx?id=6 You forget the 3rd very important variable. Competitor chips. With Bitmain already shipping in bulk, and Spondoolies wrapping up their next gen, HF chips are increasingly non-competitive. That depends on how much you paid for it. nTek has simply purchased an existing miner worth about $1500, shipped it to you, and kept the rest of your payment ($7k?). Looks like "june or july" was again overly optimistic. Since this is the lie thread, here's another. http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/Outright lie. Bitmain and Spondoolies are also on their 2nd gen 28nm ASICs. Bitmain has even shipped, and Spondoolies is due to ship in days. That's what MtGox used to say. How'd that turn out? Wattage? Did you get more than 1 sample X3? Wifi works. Check it out:  While not perfect (lower than projected speed due to power issues), an excellent delivery just 1 month after the initial announcement. Good job Bitmain. Well, they've shipped quite a few, but I think there are still a lot of pre-orders not yet shipped. KnC sorta, but I'd rather have Bitmain's (or Spondoolies) 28nm technology over KnC's 20nm. Nice. What's the PSU and hashrate? Unfortunately, getting PayPal to pay up for an order that long ago is very hard. It's definitely worth trying, but don't get your hopes up. When using PayPal, always be sure to open a dispute within the allotted time (45 days).
The marshals just completed a 30k auction, and if anything, the price went up. It sure didn't crash. Why not buy some now, and buy more if it goes under 500? There's a good chance we never drop below 500 again. When bitcoin hits 5000 you'll really wish you had bought at 620. So this is what they're shipping to everyone? $1000 machines to people who spent $5000? Even Apple can't pull off those kind of profit margins. WTG Josh! AMT continues their censorship spree, without giving customers answers. I assumed that was the schedule for batch 1. Are you sure that's also the schedule for batch 2? The post above yours.http://yiazo.com/product-category/mining-hardware/ When does batch 2 close? Ok, good. Yes, 2000 will blow not only every 15a circuit, but every 20a circuit at 120v. You can't run a circuit above 80% continuous (20a * 120v * 80% = 1920 watts). You will have to use dual circuits. They come with dual 1000w power supplies, so you'll have to put each power supply on a separate circuit. Please don't encourage the scammers. It's not a joke. Someone could make a mistake and get taken for a lot of money. You do realize those are the exact same machines AMT is now bragging about? Delays must be accepted by the customer, and if the customer refuses to accept the delay, a "prompt refund" is required. Never ending delays without refunds is not legal. Period. The two best mining manufacturers, Bitmain and Spondoolies, are in between generations. By the end of July they should both be pumping out huge amounts of hashpower. Enjoy a couple small difficulty increases. It's a temporary respite. You can't beat Bitfury for quiet. New Bitfurys are available, but are quite expensive.Kept in a cool place, I expect the new S3 to be relatively quiet. Sorry AMT, deleting posts won't do any good. That depends. Do they deliver freshly-minted coins? If not, then they're just another ponzi. Proceed at your own risk. Take a look at BFL. Day 1 Monarch orders were 47 weeks ago! Do you honestly believe it's legal that if you promise to ship "someday" you can hold customer funds forever and never give a refund? Fortunately there are laws against such tactics. It is not legal to never deliver a product nor a refund.http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/bus02-business-guide-mail-and-telephone-order-merchandise-rule"or more" is not a certain time frame, and thus the 30-day rule comes into effect. That's too bad. http://www.passportsforbitcoin.com/ was a nice idea. To point out just one more of their many lies.
It's a distraction. They hope that by quoting low electric rates you'll assume their hosting rates are also low. Nice map. Now mark where you think "430 Johnson St" is. Is it on the side of Johnson street with 437 Johnson St, or on the other side (where the rear of the masonic lodge is)?Hey, AMT, where on that map is your office located? They shouldn't have promised Q1/Q2 shipping. They lied about shipping in Q1, and rightly people refunded when they failed to meet it. 20 amp circuit should be run at max 80% draw, so 16 amps * 115 volts = 1840 watts max. 10 months ago Bitfurys did 400 GH/s at 350 watts. The new S3 does 500 GH/s at 400 watts. Your ideas are so far from the facts it's laughable. Anyone wanna take a bet on whether AMT shipped all of them as promised?  Rik's return was delivered last friday. They promised to send out replacements immediately, so I'm sure rik has his new miner by now. How about it rik? How's the new miner? Only if they buy additional hardware. But they already spent the income on the current hardware and power. New income from new customers is required to keep the ponzi alive.But all evidence points to them not having any hardware, so their hardware and energy costs are all $0. Only for a few more months. 6-12 months out, we'll be seeing under 18% jumps regularly. And it cost, what, 60 coins?Most of batch-1 that was a big winner. Batch-2 was a toss up. Everything after that was a disaster. You give BFL entirely too much credit. Bitcoindf.org has absolutely no charity/non-profit status whatsoever. It is owned and operated by BFL. And why would they want to? Bitcoin is just another revenue stream for them. They'll just tax it. Too bad transferring bitcoins is so hard. I was going to transfer 100 BTC of my wealth to you. No matter, I'll visit NewEgg instead. Too pessimistic. With free power these will easily break even and make a nice profit. Of course they are. They're horribly overpriced! You kinda forgot the most important fact. When the S3 starts hashing. Time for our monthly update on Monarch ship dates:http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/ Which is it? Are the secrets hackable, or are they unrecoverable? You can't have it both ways. Uh, no it's not. As fireduck mentioned in his detailed blog, http://correcthorsebatterystaple.net/ is one example of a method to generate a highly secure, easily memorized, brain wallet. It's not "impossible". It just needs to be done carefully.Here is my brain wallet, generated from correcthorsebatterystaple.net. Hack it and win 1 BTC!https://blockchain.info/address/1LyoCGuuBQzqKintFHsgNEm5ZDR91prUku
Since AMT is on the delete rampage, here's some more deleted posts.Because of this little lie:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=304605.msg5586157#msg5586157Bothers me? Not at all. It's totally hilarious! "We're not masons, our office being in the lodge is just a coincidence!" ROFLMAO.Well now it's obvious why FedEx couldn't find it. Their new "office" isn't a real address. It's the back door to the lodge. What are the requirements to be able to enter their "office"? There we go. A couple more blocks solved. That'll help the order payments go through. Don't worry much. Bitmain is pretty good about shipping units that have been paid for. Ouch. Only 2 blocks in the last 80 min. And it will survive most shipping mishandlings! Why all in 1 day? This auction is taking over a month. I guarantee I could buy up 30k btc in a month without moving the price a noticable amount. No way! AMT's office is in the back of the Masonic Lodge??? Wouldn't it make sense to put this stuff in the Namecoin blockchain? Exactly. Hashrate follows price. I expect the next bubble to hit before the end of the year. Combined with the heating benefits of running miners in winter, the hashrate is going to be crazy high by the end of this year. A lawsuit is what you get when you lie to customers and fail to deliver. Don't try to blame your customers. You are the failure. Anyone find a 6TH Neptune yet? Can you link to the official ruling? I can't seem to locate it.http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/25plmbwgc/pennsylvania-eastern-district-court/lenell-et-al-v-advanced-mining-technology-inc-et-al/ The question is quite valid. A truthful response would be "No, my refund was not handled like other customers, because I'm an employee." What you don't understand is they can't afford to buy SP30s, unless they're using new customers funds to buy mining equipment for old customers. Their continued operation requires new customers, or they will fail. That's a ponzi. Yeah, you see the question was asked? You failed to answer truthfully. We all know your refund was not handled "as any other customer's would be". You conveniently left off that you received your refund before other customers who requested their refunds before you. Lies of ommision are still lies. Not really. Further increases will be minimal. My Bitfury rigs from Aug '13 run at .9 J/GH. Nearly a year later, new rigs are .7 J/GH.Bingo! That's where they are now. No need to mine, just send new customer coins to old customers. Ponzi! BTC was at about $100 when you ordered, making your order cost nearly 50 BTC. Now you can earn back .02 BTC per day (and dropping), making your RoI 2500 days assuming no further difficulty increases. Ouch! How many more times are you going to let the horse kick you in the teeth before you stop trying to make him drink? It's a bad horse. Put him down! Don't misplace your anger. The lawsuit is 100% AMT's fault. Don't blame clenell for wanting to get what he paid for.
Sorry to hear about that. Why didn't you request a refund? Even BFL employees were smart enough to request a refund. Wait until Bitmain announces prices. You cannot calculate RoI without the initial cost! Slightly better than worthless is still worthless.After the next difficulty adjustment in a few days, these will generate $.25 per day at best. That's a minimum of 400 days for RoI if difficulty never goes up. They're worthless. Only if you also have unlimited electricity. (PM me if you have free unlimited electricity, I have a deal for you!) You can fit 3 S1s on a 15 amp circuit, for only 600 GH/s. You could fit 3 S3s on the same circuit and get 1500 GH/s! Bitmain is doing it the right way. They are not taking payments before they can deliver. If there's a delay, I want it to be before I send payment, not after! Really? Would you rather buy from Bitmain who doesn't communicate but always delivers, or BFL who communicates but never delivers? Sounds about right, but only while bitcoin is priced around $600. The next bubble will make buying new hardware highly profitable once again. Nice. I'll give you 20 bucks for it. I replaced my mattress with SP10s. Keeps me warm at night. Excellent. Send me 9 btc now, and when the price doubles, I'll send you 6 btc. It appears that AMT has rented a back-alley closet that has never had packages delivered to it before, so FedEx didn't find it at first. But FedEx got that worked out, and now AMT is back to their never-accept-packages SOP (Standard Operating Procedure). For existing orders, just the opposite is true. What matters most is how many BTC the SP30 generates. If the exchange rate goes up, and the network hashrate also goes up, then the SP30 will mine fewer BTC.A high exchange rate will make future SP30 purchases more profitable, since fewer BTC will be spent purchasing the SP30 and thus the BTC mined to break even will be lower. Bingo! Hashrate follows price. BFL doesn't care about skills, all you need to do to get a job there is shill for them on BCT. The "promise" is still being made, even today.https://www.kncminer.com/pages/faq I expect BFL to be able to demonstrate a product that meets the promised specs. Yet here we are, 7 months late, and they can't even show a single full spec Monarch. Actually, it's quite horrible. It's not even close to what was promised. https://forums.butterflylabs.com/the-monarch-discussion/8553-monarch-cloud-mining-update-06-17-2014-11-03-pm-2.html#post83438Poor Josh, always missing deadlines. So rather than fixing his business to meet their own deadlines, he's going to punish customers by refusing to give dates ever again. Of course, this is against FTC regulations, but BFL thinks they're above the law. Do you mind asking your people to post in their linked-in profiles their connections with your company? Not a good estimate beyond about 3-6 months from now. Difficulty isn't going to continue rising that fast for a whole year.
It's getting close. While BA is shipping the X-1 about 4 months late, BFL is over 7 months late. At least BA is shipping something. BFL is shipping nothing. BA needs to get the X-3 out the door, and come clean on the compensation package ASAP. You can't ask specific questions like that. BFL is pro at redefining terms. When you say "Monarch", they mean a specific product sold only to customers. They can ship all sorts of products using the new chips and not call them "Monarchs". Just like how they mine with customer equipment because they don't call it customer equipment until they are done mining with it. What happened to the 6/16 filing date? Was anything filed? Posting from work again, eh? Does Josh know you troll the forum while at work? Now that is very possible! FTFY. Thanks for bringing this to light. bcp19 has been quite deceitful in hiding his employment (I'm not surprised, Josh does the same thing). In fact, he has now deleted posts to try to hide the fact of his shilling. Take a look at this quote, which he has now deleted:Now it all makes sense! That also explains why he was able to get a refund out of order (if he actually did request one).SHILLThat perfectly describes bcp19. But to get to that rating you have to custom wire the connector. Standard PSUs only have 3 hot wires, even on a 8-pin connector. 288w is the limit. There's a lot of competitive products in the $1-$1.5/GH range, so if they do price it nicely around $1/GH they'll sell extremely well. Quite a few. Avalon, BitFury, ASICMiner, Bitmain, Spondoolies. That was the claim. He claimed if BTC goes to $1000 then he has ROI'd in fiat. I proved him wrong. Fiat RoI is useless, and I can prove it. Let's say your target is +50% RoI.BTC RoI: Buy a miner for 1 BTC worth $610 USD now. Miner generates 1.5 BTC over its life. +50% BTC RoI.Fiat RoI: Send me 1 BTC now worth $610 USD. When BTC goes to $1000, I'll send you .915 BTC worth $915. +50% Fiat RoI.If you truly believe in Fiat ROI, I offer you a guaranteed +50% fiat profit. How many BTC will you send me now? p2pool is a pool, so the "luck" is shared by all nodes, but your node actually creates the block, so you have full control over which transactions to include or not. Batch 2 is next month. Both. Each p2pool node generates its own block, but shares the winnings with all the other nodes. That's why p2pool is so important. It's a truly decentralized pool. Yeah, a 20nm chip that's about as efficient as Spondoolie's 40nm chip. Spondoolie's 28nm chip will slaughter KnC. Dear AMT,Now that 6/16 has passed, what was the answer you filed? All bitcoins have a history stored in the blockchain. Any "fake" bitcoins will not have a history there, and as such, the software automatically detects such fakes. It's simple, really. If you somehow had vast amounts of computing power, you could mine all of the rest of the bitcoins faster than you could crack a single address. I would be interested in cloud mining, but only if the coins received were truly freshly-minted coins.
No one has ever done it. No one will ever do it. For all intents and purposes, it is not possible. http://www.usmarshals.gov/assets/2014/bitcoins/ Bitfury from last year could run without fans. A 1000w PSU? Sounds too weak. $ sudo apt-get install bitcoind* create ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf with "rpcuser=something" and "rpcpassword=somethingcomplex".$ bitcoind -daemon http://www.scribd.com/doc/217190032/Butterfly-Labs-Production-of-Requested-Information-December-6-2013 So what's your job responsibilities? AMT is many months late on delivering a working product. Shouldn't you be working instead of trolling forums? Looks like someone found an old sockpuppet account they forgot about. Hi again!  Good call. We're well into June and no Monarchs.Here's the current calc.Difficulty 11756551916.9Price $630Bitcoins per day: .026Dollars per day: 16 His house was listed for $405,000 CDN, and he received 648 BTC, so $625 CDN, that's what, $575 USD? Ok, I didn't see your prices were VAT-inclusive. That makes it Â€79.28 verses your Â€125.It's the same 14-string Bitfury chip. The speeds are the same. There's lots of places to compare your prices to, and they are all far better priced than yours. But here's one that really proves the point.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=495536.01 OneStringMiner board, Â€65.52Same basic Bitfury 14-chip string design. Not only is their board half your price, but it even includes the hashing controller, which you put on a different board costing another Â€120. If you need BTC to skyrocket to ROI, then you're far better off just buying the BTC. I'm starting to feel bad for the guy. I think he cracked. Something not right with him. Unfortunately, the overpriced initial hardware costs far outweigh the low-power cost savings. Best case scenario, every board overclocks to 38 GH/s, cost for 380 GH/s rig is $1850. That's still nearly $5/ghps. Your competitors are shipping $1-$2/ghps. I love Bitfury chips, but I'm not going to pay 3x the cost for them! Nice to see a new Bitfury setup. Unfortunately, the price is way way way too high. I wish. They're more like a zombie. Latest Josh fail:https://forums.butterflylabs.com/the-monarch-discussion/8492-monarch-engineering-update-31-may-2014-a-25.html#post82550Another board revision! There goes any chance of shipping in June. Why don't your payout accounts receive freshly minted coins? Can you show a trail from minted coins to payout coins?
I'm not hearing anything about compensation for delivering 6 months late. You really should clarify your plan. I've watched it go from .01 to .1 to 1 to 10 to 100 to 1000. I think we can all agree that Bitcoin is far from everywhere, so the next step to 10,000 is almost assured. After that, we're just half a step away from 50k. The odds of that happening are pretty good! Thanks. I browsed the blockchain history a bit and didn't see any generated coins. I question whether this service is actually mining. Sideways is making it very hard to avoid work these days. You do realize that by using a mixing service they are basically admitting they are not mining? Mined coins are untraceable. They have no history. There is no point in mixing them. You should mount a GoPro on that puppy so we can all get a front-row seat. Do I have a deal for you! Send me 1 BTC worth $650 today, and when BTC goes to $1500, I'll send you .65 BTC. That's a guaranteed 50% profit for you!!!!! You sure on that? Have you been to the new office? 20 BTC if you go visit the new office.  Will you post the address? I'd like to see if the coins are newly minted. Actually, they don't. They are doing business in PA under some other company's name. That's not legitimate. Possibly. But he took years to do it, it had some serious flaws, and that was just software. I'm sure you can attest to the fact that lining up and deliverying working hardware on a very short schedule is much harder.I won't deny there are amazing engineers out there. Bitfury did one hell of a job. He's probably the best to have touched bitcoin so far. But not even Bitfury could deliver a complete miner with a 40nm ASIC in 6 months. Novello appears to be one "engineer" who thinks he can create a world-leading full custom bitcoin ASIC miner from the ground up without any delays and without missing any specs. Ask yourself this question, "Is this single engineer, who won't post an actual resume or any work experience, better than all the other teams like HashFast, CoinTerra, BFL, Bitmine, BlackArrow, etc.?" ASICMiner, Avalon, BitFury, KnC, Bitmain, Spondoolies, all basically delivered on time on spec for their first round of products. (some were a little late, but much better specs, so it's no real difference) With that post deleted, I must assume it is correct. AMT does not have functioning miners to send to RMA returns. "YouÂ’ll receive a confirmation email stating that we have received your miner and we will immediately ship you a brand new miner."And how are you going to do that? You don't have any working miners. 10 grand for 6 TH/s: https://www.mining-asics-technologies.com/product/titanium-2-asic-bitcoin-miner-6-ths-super-low-power/or5 grand for 6 TH/s: http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/products/sp30-yukon-september-batch-1I think the choice is clear. Of course. They promised they wouldn't build it. But none of that matters. The only thing that matters is whether the team has the skills and capacities to actually see this project to completion on time with the right specs. I've seen nothing to indicate that to be true. Just the opposite. The lack of details concerning who this "dream team" is is a huge red flag. It's 99% likely they will fail and keep all the money for themselves. It better be one hell of an update. IMET, since they ripped you off and stole your parts.
Why would they be upset? Their scam is working out quite well. So far they've snagged $4,539 simply by posting a few paragraphs of text. Man, if I could make $4k in a couple days I'd be pretty happy too! So why haven't you filed a lawsuit? Both Bitmain and Spondoolies have good products with competitive prices. Lifespan on either one will be much longer than they will be profitable. Then let's look at some mining companies that have actually shipped miners (even if they've had some difficulties).http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/pages/teamhttp://cointerra.com/team/http://hashfast.com/team/http://butterflylabs.com/management/You: Nothing but bullshit. Why? Because you don't have what it takes to complete this "project". Call IMET and ask to buy some boards for cost. IMET might love to get some money out of this disaster. Bottom line, you do not have the skill to complete this project. This project will never succeed. How about now? Then prove it. Prove you have the skills necessary to design and implement an actual miner. Most other teams, with far more experience than you, have tried and failed. What ASICs have you designed that are larger and more power hungry than a bitcoin ASIC? Exactly what part of the design did you do? What PCBs that deliver hundreds of amps have you designed? You want people to give you millions of dollars, yet you want to remain anonymous. You'll never reach your funding level on Indigogo. But good for you, you selected the "Flexible Funding" option, so that you get all the money no matter what. The perfect scam.Public Service AnnouncementThis "company" will fail. They do not have the funding, nor the expertise, to make it to a final product. Invest only what money you want to lose. They will never deliver a miner. Then come clean. Who the hell are you?This is what a real company with real people looks like:http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/pages/team Nice generic names. So who are you, really? Facebook, LinkedIn, anything? Are you an EVP of Oracle? Are you a dead heavy metal drummer? Are you a basketball player? Beat this or go home:http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/pages/team So the motion hasn't been filed? So there is nothing actually stopping your business. You're simply taking the easy route by not delivering miners and not providing refunds. The report listed 1EFJUipfCHFmmTFkF9vvjFKdBf3VbfvarM as the addressed used to demonstrate the balance. The funds were later transferred to 1J4PsqPxu6m9HcRBpdXExa7jnCsjJPozec and are still there. That is probably the cold wallet address. Look again:http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/"plan to begin shipments in May, 2014." That makes no sense. Which part of the lawsuit bans AMT from giving delivery dates? Which part of the lawsuit overrides FTC regulations? Which part of the lawsuit makes refunds illegal? People just want their refunds or delivery dates, the 2 things required by FTC regulations. No lawsuit could hinder those actions by AMT. Time for our monthly update on Monarch ship dates:Oct: "November / DecemberÂ  Â  Initial Shipping"Nov: "November / DecemberÂ  Â  Initial Shipping"Dec: "With that in mind, our current schedule is on track for shippments to begin towards end of year."Jan: "However, this is our second generation, so we have much greater clarity on the process and plan to begin shipments in January 2014."Feb: "However, this is our second generation, so we have much greater clarity on the process and plan to begin shipments in February, 2014."Mar: "However, this is our second generation, so we have much greater clarity on the process and plan to begin shipments in February, 2014."Apr:Â  "However, this is our second generation, so we have much greater clarity on the process and plan to begin shipments in February, 2014."May: "However, this is our second generation, so we have much greater clarity on the process and plan to begin shipments in May, 2014."Jun: "However, this is our second generation, so we have much greater clarity on the process and plan to begin shipments in May, 2014."Now that we're in June, the expected ship date is last month. In one sense bASIC was the best of the bunch. Tom actually refunded everyone. Oh look, Josh is back. Still on track for that November, December, January, February, March, April, May delivery? Can I change my vote on the poll now?
At 3 BTC these should be able to make a nice ROI, assuming you have a well-priced hosting/electrical cost. Probably because they just did a 3rd party audit 6 months ago.https://www.bitstamp.net/s/documents/Firestartr_DD_Letter_for_Bitstamp.pdfYou can't expect a company to release multiple audits per year. BFL is the biggest blight on the bitcoin economy. I won't stop beating them until they are out of business. Monarch ship dates:NovemberDecemberJanuaryFebruaryMarchApriland now MayAnd I won't stop making a fool of you until you go away too. Since everyone is still quoting him, I'll add my kick.Jorge, here's a homework assignment for you. Shouldn't take you more than 1 hr. What big bitcoin even happened on Nov 28, 2012? On second thought, that might be too hard for you. Here's a clue. It happened on block # 210,000. There is a forum guideline. Please people, stop quoting that guy. He consistantly gets "facts" completely wrong. I don't think he's stupid, so he must be doing it on purpose, ie trolling.Second Market has bought over 100,000 bitcoins. That makes them in fact one of the largest buyers in the world. So, how is that FCC certification coming along? Still two weeks? You have really perfected the art of saying nothing of substance. Good job! Just like when I get pulled over for doing 100 in a 50 mph zone. I offer the officer a $100 bill with no strings attached. There's nothing wrong with that, right?It's like I said. You were paid for your BFL support. Read http://www.courts.phila.gov/pdf/brochures/mc/SMALL-CLAIMS-PAMPHLET.pdf to start. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=441275.msg5069190#msg5069190Yeah, they gave you a "gift". So tell me, how many bitcoins did this "gift" generate for you? You're right, the comparison isn't fair. BFL, who is always late, vs. Spondoolies, who has never been late. Did you miss the part about "We will not mine with more than 5% of the hash rate we sell"? 7% of the network is many times greater than 5% of their sales. That's a huge broken promise. BFL gave you a miner in return for being a staunch defender of their shady tactics. BFL definitely got their money's worth. Yeah, they didn't actually keep that promise. The sun will run out of fuel before we run out of addresses. PoS is too flawed at this point. Someday someone may figure out a way to plug the holes, but for now, PoS is too easily exploited in several ways. Most shills don't admit to it. bcp19 has. If I was you, I would have filed a small claims suit long ago. AMT proves time and time again they have no capability to make things right. Law suits will be settled first, everyone else will get nothing.Here, I'll help you with the first step.http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/pennsylvania-small-claims-court-32087.html Great point, because it would be impossible for one entity to control millions of machines, right?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BredoLab_botnet
There's real Jorge and fake Jorge. Fake Jorge is far more entertaining. Just remember, when it does tank, it's a temporary situtation. Don't panic sell for some pizza. They did it once before. Remember this "delivered" unit that was actually sitting in BFL's lab? Refunds will be stopped shortly. Get your refund while you can! It's hard to keep up with his name changes. Here's his latest post: Blockchain.info attempts to remove change. It's not perfect, but I think it does give a decent ballpark. Shit. Someone quoted you and I saw another one of your idiotic answers. Bitcoin market cap: $7BCredit card fraud just last year alone: $11BFact: more money is lost in a single year due to credit card fraud.And concerning your further idiotic estimates, it doesn't matter how much Bitpay claims to process. Bitpay is one very small piece of the bitcoin world. blockchain.info estimates nearly 100 million processed per day. And that's only counting actual on-chain transactions. There are countless more off-chain transactions. Your 400 million per year is just more of your bullshit. It's more like 100x that much. Wrong. Do you even have any idea how profitable just credit card fraud is? The credit card fraud in a single year alone absolutely dwarfs the entire bitcoin ecosystem. And this goes on every year, non stop. You obviously have no clue what you're talking about. Credit cards basically have their private keys printed on the front of the card. Every time you use a credit card you are at risk of having it stolen. Bitcoin actually reduces fraud. You can purchase anything from anywhere, and not ever risk your private key being taken during the purchase. A merchant can accept bitcoin from any customer throughout the world and never have to worry about chargebacks.Sorry, I can't handle your idiotic comments anymore. Welcome to my ignore list. There are only 2 good choices. Spondoolies and Bitmain. Steer clear of everyone else. I'm with Ace. Don't leave bitcoin/fiat sitting on an exchange for months. You're just asking to get Goxxed. I think I just had a seizure. That's a great plan for getting new customers, but why are you wasting effort on that? You should be focusing 120% on making restitution to your existing customers. Anyone who buys from you in the future is an idiot. You fail to ship products. You fail to adequately package products. You fail to repair broken products. You fail to give refunds. You fail at everything! I'll say it. They're not legit. If they stopped taking orders today, there is no way they would be able to continue paying out for 5 more years. The numbers just do not add up. The only way thay can stay in business is to get new customers to pay the old ones. That would be a nice price if it was "shipping today". That's overpriced for "shipping next month". Here's one quote: They did. They explicitly claimed refunds would be exactly the same number of BTC as a refund. Yes, the questions are intrusive. Can you point to a single case where someone who cannot answer the questions has had a withdrawal refused? Nothing to discuss. They don't have a working board yet. Those "numbers" aren't accurate. I take it option #1 is no longer possible seeing how another 2 weeks have passed since that "end of this week" deadline. SnapCard did a special. https://www.joinsnapcard.com/bitcoin-pizza-day/ I got a cheese pizza delivered for BTC.002!https://i.imgur.com/f4NI009.jpg That must be the most expensive AC unit in the world!
S2 is 1 TH/s @ $1844 (just use one of the countless $400 off coupons lying around). You can buy anything in the world for BTC. Send me 1000 BTC and I'll charter a private jet and come pick you up. Today is already Bitcoin Pizza Day, so how about tomorrow? We'll call it Bitcoin Rescue Jet Day. The pizzas were 10,000 BTC, so think of this as a real bargain. One more thing. Have you ever posted in a non-BFL thread? I just checked your last 100 posts. 100% are in BFL threads defending BFL. 100%!!! You really need to get out more. Your obsession with BFL is quite unhealthy. Such a nice product. It's a shame the price is too high for me. Sure you are.There, defending BFL.There you go defending Josh, which is the same as defending BFL. Thank you. I've been looking forward for that gif.  Where do you get these crazy ideas? There's nothing in Bitcoin that is incompatible with banks or governments. Poor guy, the intense pain is so bad he had to buy a $500,000 house. I'm sure all of his customers waiting on their miners are buying houses too to try to ease their pains. I sure hope he doesn't start thinking about seppuku again. I'm hearing conflicting messages. Are the hashboards good or not? Did you finally buy a bitcoin? No? Then you had nothing to do with the rally. Aw, #firstworldproblems. Not a chance. Here's the big picture. In the words of the judge:The official word from the judge, BFL stinks. We all know BFL stinks. Yet you continue to defend them. Unbelievable! http://www.scribd.com/doc/217190032/Butterfly-Labs-Production-of-Requested-Information-December-6-2013pg 3. https://forums.butterflylabs.com/announcements/4414-monarch-information-2.html#post77863Tomorrow makes 11 weeks, yet not a single working Monarch. A great example of Josh's totally bogus timeline estimates.https://forums.butterflylabs.com/announcements/4414-monarch-information-post79874.html#post79874So shipping the week of 4/28 - 5/2? Nope, no working devices yet.https://forums.butterflylabs.com/blogs/bfl_josh/386-monarch-update-30-april-2014-a.htmlWhat's your guess. Did they ship when Josh predicted? Surprise! They didn't. 20 days later and nothing shipped.  Then you must really love Bitcoin. CPUs in 2010 where .1 J/MH, and now just 4 years later we're running ASICS at 1 J/GH. That's an efficiency improvement of 1,000,000% in just 4 years. Where else do you see such massive improvements in efficiency? Nice strawman! No one ever claimed they built 8000 units and started mining with them all at once. The truth is, BFL takes pre-order funds, builds miners, then mines for profit with those customer machines. How many at a time? No one knows. But the fact that they do it is not under dispute. They stated such in court records. BFL mines with customer equipment, and they own EMC, so it's pretty safe to say they are mining at EMC. Oh, they're not forgetting. They are updating their pages, but they leave the lies up on purpose.
Now how do you feel? ScamBand is getting back together! They setup their ponzi in Canada, so the cooling costs for the imaginary hardware are only during a short summer. There's no way they're delivering 2x3600 in June. None. Why bother estimating the impossible? The current compensation plan is about right if they ship everything next week. It's naive to think they actually will ship then. They should have demoed a full X-3 running by this point. It's safe to say a lot of people are rightly concerned about continued delays. 3.6 TH/s is a bit optimistic at this point. They don't have a single X-3 running at full speed yet. I don't want to lug around a second phone. But I would swap in a new sim card, so just have the hotel provide local sim cards for the stay. The rest of the phone-related add-ons can simply be an app that is easily installed when checking in. Another Josh lie. No one ever said the increases would go on forever. They already spent the income buying the hardware. How are they going to fund buying new hardware? New customers? Bingo! Ponzi. You don't see a problem with that? The cost of electricity alone is 3x what they bring in from each customer. Not really. The extra 3 TH/s will be delivered months later. Most ASIC designs at this point have been quick and dirty designs. Only two seem to have had "hashes per joule" as a primary goal, Bitfury and Bitmain. Both of those designs are at a huge 55nm, yet are nearly as efficient as all the other 28nm designs. Because AMT knows they can't directly blame IMET, as that would be libel, and they'd just get sued again. If you're going to do 50TH, forget the S1. Get 36 SP10s instead. Call up Spondoolies and I'm sure you get can a discount for a 36 unit order. Setting up 36 units would be a piece of cake. How would AMT pays state taxes when they're not registered with the state to do business in PA. Spondoolies is good, but don't forget, Bitmain did it first. Yeah, it was an order transfer. I don't think eightcylinders is too happy with his choice now. Every day that goes by means less and less $$$ in their bank account. Eventually it will reach 0. So time is of the essence if you want to get your money back. Amazing teams don't produce duds. Your first board isn't just a dud, your whole team is. It's worse than both Bitmain and Bitfury, 55nm chips from last year!
This is AMT we are talking about. They won't show up and you'll win a default judgement. The trouble will be collecting on the judgement. I found AMT's business plan. They need patient customers:Be patient, AMT will get to you...somewhere around the end of time. https://twitter.com/HashFast/status/463457525598138368Stop the presses! They shipped an order! All Bitmain needs to do is ship the hashing cards uninstalled and bubble-wrapped. The S2 is not designed to be shipped.  lmao They don't want anyone to buy their stuff. They're done with retail business. Customers were just way to fund their massive mining farm. This is a key point. Laundered coins from a "mining operation", is 99% a scam. If they had an actual mining farm, they would have generated coins with no history. Mined coins are completely untraceable. There is absolutely no reason to launder them. None. Speaking of legally conducting a business, where is your legal registration? Don't take my word for it:USPS Address Lookup Who are you? Code:6. PlaintiffsÂ’ claims are barred because the products in question underwent burntesting for a minimal amount of time and had not be assigned to a customer order at the time ofthe burn testing.7. PlaintiffsÂ’ claims are barred because untested products are not finished goods andcould not be customersÂ’ equipment.Do I understand this correctly? They mine with hardware that will be sent to customers, but claim it isn't customer hardware because there isn't an order number attached to the machine yet, and it isn't customer hardware because they're not yet finished mining with it??? Only after they finish mining with it, then it becomes customer hardware. I don't see it answered. Please quote where you answered the question. Very simple question. Where is your company? Sure thing. The building on the right is Wells Fargo at 1 California. The tree on the left is 19 California.http://s18.postimg.org/qfwsztdll/image.pngP.S. If you're going to call someone an "ABSOLUTE idiot", you might want to figure out what the difference between "silicone" and "silicon", the difference between "you're" and "your", and how to spell "accusations". Yes.So your scam was profitable today.Oh, we're just getting started.Ah, so you're an Australian company?No, wait, you're based in downtown SF. Strange, I don't remember a building at 19 California St. Why don't you post a photo of your building?That's a Yahoo Customer Service phone line. Now Yahoo is building bitcoin miners?And your server is hosted in Utah.So where is your company? You do have a real company don't you? Bingo. There's how they profit from this scam. They're hoping that some people will see the "escrow available" and go ahead and order and pay directly. They've stated just the opposite. They've stated that pre-orders are the only way to fund the massive production growth they are expecting. Tradeblock doesn't work well past a few months. The difficulty is not going to keep growing like that. PBMining could easily break even within a year, if they last that long. I really doubt they will. Let's see what the actual court had to say.Let me highlight the important comment from the court...Hmm, who's right? bcp19 or the court...
Don't sell yourself short. You're still a miner since you're mining with customers' equipment on your own pool. Liar! It says right there, http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/ Because 1KW draw is not equal to 1KW output. Assuming 90% efficiency, a 1000W draw is only outputting 900W. PSUs are rated on their output, not the draw. Fees are not required by the protocol, so they can easily change over time. When the exchange rate goes up 1000x, the fees expected by most miners will adjust accordingly. Well, yeah, but your actual rate isn't $0.064313. That's the base charge. They also add in several more charges.Base: $0.064313Fuel Charge: $0.021836Transmission Charge: $0.011165Environmental Cost: $0.003136Energy Efficient Rider: $0.000538Property Tax Surcharge: $0.001106Subtotal: $0.102094Francise Fee (3%): $0.00306282Local Sales Tax (1%): $0.00102094Actual rate: $0.10617776Which is actually 65% higher than you first estimated. Sounds about right. You have unusually low power costs, which is why you can stay above water. Most miners have significantly higher costs, especially when you including cooling costs. They've already admitted to it. It's in the court record, straight from BFL's lawyer. And S1 will survive shipping. Bitmain needs to fix the S2! Just ignore him. Mr. "in two weeks" doesn't understand how numbers work. Sorta. You'll get the second one months later, after difficulty has skyrocketed. They are "incorporated" in DE. PA requires registration as a "foreign business". Business registration records are public. Not only is AMT not registered to do business in PA, but they are using the name of another business.No, because those business are correctly registered to do business in other states. Let's take a look at how a fine upstanding business does it.Incorporated in WY:https://wyobiz.wy.gov/Business/FilingDetails.aspx?eFNum=149144214231010201167112190255028042109060235081Registered in KS (perform business entity search, search for "bf labs"):https://www.kansas.gov/bess/flow/main?execution=e2s1 AMT is not registered to do business in PA, so yes, they do not have a proper business entity. How do you do that? You either have the money or you don't. If you have the money, the law states you must provide your customers with a prompt refund. If you do not have the money, you are simply running a ponzi waiting to receive money from new customers to pay old customers. You have not been following the law and providing prompt refunds, therefore your business must be a ponzi now. Dalkore,Your first order of business should be to see that HashFast_CL gets terminated. He will undo any progress you make in improving the situation. Looks like AMT doesn't like having their illegal activities brought to light. Well, deleting posts won't work. Excellent. Bitmain is already shipping miners at $1.5/ghps. So if someone paid $6k for Prosperos, they should be getting at least 4 TH/s right now. In a month when you actually do ship, we're talking more like 5 TH/s. Looking forward to seeing you match the competitors. At 1.25 kw that comes out to $.18/kwh. That's still quite costly. Why do you claim to accept credit cards, when you do not actually accept them? Excellent choice. The more you pay them, the longer they will can keep this ponzi running. Not quite. You should include the cost of a power supply. And since April is nearly over, you don't get a full month at the low difficulty in your calculation. Look at this:https://tradeblock.com/mining/a/379dc97925Although tradeblock is too pessimistic on difficulty increases a few months out. So yes, a new S1 might break even. 
BFL mines with customer hardware on the mining pool they secretly own (EclipseMC). That is stealing.http://www.scribd.com/doc/217190032/Butterfly-Labs-Production-of-Requested-Information-December-6-2013 Because by not answering, they can string you along for longer. AMT_Josh learned from the best (BFL_Josh) in how to string people along month, after month, after month. With luck your issue will be resolved by the end of the year. Horrible chart, because you ignored valid data. You can't just ignore previous years. Very little. Daily trading volume averages around 20k on slow days, peaking at well over 300k on busy days. Dumping gox coins all in one day wouldn't be all that unusual of a trading day. The liquidator is not going to place a 200k market order on some random exchange. They will be liquidated in an orderly manner. The effect on the market will be minimal, and temporary. Any time a block is orphaned, there is a (very small) chance a transaction from the orphaned block won't get confirmed in the new chain. Typically there are about 2 orphans per day:https://blockchain.info/charts/n-orphaned-blocks?timespan=30days&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=A single confirmation is by no means a guarantee that the transaction will stay valid. That is why the normal bitcoin client shows transactions as "unconfirmed" until there are 6 confirmations. Wow, phatk kernel. I haven't seen that in ages. I would so love to see him do a 28nm shrink. That's what people said 3 years ago:The big unknown - the exchange rate. If the exchange rate goes back up again, miners will continue to be profitable. If it keeps dropping, then yeah, miners are going to start shutting down their machines. Are you high or drunk, or both? That's a horrible price! 10x of those gets you 26 GH/s for $400. 1x Antminer S1 gets you 180 GH/s for about the same price. 26 GH/s vs 180 GH/s. Except for the fact that they are still accepting orders for 2.4T and 3.2T units. Then send your BTC to me. Every day I'll send you a few satoshis. In a few months, you may or may not receive more BTC than you originally had. So just buy BTC. Then when BTC reaches 850, you'll be at +75% ROI, rather than simply break even. I hope they do something about the case design. They can't keep shipping them with little plastic holders. I wish this forum had a way to ignore a whole thread. Assuming 1 million users, at 70k transactions per day, that means the average bitcoin user makes 2 transactions per month. That seems plausible. Won't this cause a problem? LOL. In your dreams. You guys with your tiny 15% increases per adjustment. I remember when it went up 10x in under a month. That was the only time it hit the maximum adjustment cap. Plus shipping brings it back up to nearly $8000. For someone without the 10% discount, it's even worse.Even if it was only 1 jump (delivery before the end of April), the break even point will still not be reached.And my difficulty adjustment estimations are quite conservative. If you actually deliver the sort of hashpower you are promising, then there's absolutely no chance of a new SP10 breaking even.
I don't want to clutter your thread with competitor comparisons, so I'll just stick with evaluating your offering.You may be making a nice profit on each SP10, but your customers won't at the current prices. Here, take a look: Mining Calculator. Those "~20 days" are enough to kill any chance at a profit. There's another competitor selling in-stock 1.6 TH/s units for $4800. Difficulty just jumped up to nearly 7B. SP10 pricing is looking worse and worse every day. You're kidding, right? $8 per GH/s? This isn't 2013 anymore. Thanks for the correction. Texas small claims courts do allow lawyers. A few other states do not. Small claims court is the best. No lawyers allowed, so minimal cost to go to small claims court. It would be easy to show you ordered a product with specific performance, and were delivered something that fails to meet the specs (or not delivered anything, etc). The hard part is you have to show up in their home town court. If you live far away, that would be a problem. Don't be an idiot. Bitcoin is not a ponzi. Let me take a look.BTC spent: 24.5455BTC earned: 11.3917Ouch, that was a huge loss! This one is the best. The key feature is the ability to calculate slowing growth to the difficulty adjustments. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=304605.msg6204860#msg6204860AMT is accusing customers of fraudulently damaging their miners in hopes of getting a refund.The fact is AMT doesn't know how to safely package items so they won't be damaged during shipment. LOL. There's no better profit than a well run Ponzi. No hazzle maintaining a real mining farm. Just eek payments out to the new suckers. Yes, you can handle pickups. You owe it to your customers, since you are horrendously late delivering their miners. No. They have guidelines on how to pack a shipment. If those guidelines are not followed, they will not reimburse damages. See if you can find AMT's packing method in the guidelines: http://images.fedex.com/us/services/pdf/packaging/Computer_fxcom.pdf Hodlers are long.  I don't know what you're talking about. My bitcoins are 100% safe from anyone else, including bankers, etc. If people send their bitcoins to someone else to hold, then they don't have bitcoins anymore. Since they don't have bitcoins anymore, they're not safe anymore. What calculator are you using?$250/mo, 720 hrs/mo, 1.25 kw = $.28/kwh It's far more simple than that. They no longer need to risk their own cash. They can now risk their customers cash at no risk to themselves, so of course that's what they're going to do. Yes, but that sort of fraud is a secondary nature. The payment to the merchant is completely safe. Once the merchant has the payment, it is completely within their control to keep it safe.To put it in another form, all other payment methods are like accepting 0-confirmation bitcoin transactions. They may or may not be valid. A 6-confirmation bitcoin transfer is far safer than every other payment method in existence. The exchange rate volitility is a minor issue. It'll go away over time. Merchants can accept bitcoins without having to fear fraud, counterfeits, or chargebacks. If they aren't comfortable with the volitility, they can be exchanged instantly for fiat. There is no safer payment method for a merchant than bitcoins. Wall on stamp pulled. Down we go. This is a key point. They say they are mixing to stay safe? The only untraceable coins are mined coins. If they really were mining, they would have the safest coins possible. Mixing is proof they are doing something wrong.
Just think how much profit they really have since there are no expenses! It's not so much a question of trust, but of risk. Pre-orders that aren't even due for 4 months are a huge risk to the customer. Why are you putting all that risk on the customer for the SP30? That's not how you did the SP10. That's the only power rating that matters, at the wall. But I don't recommend leaving the kill-a-watt plugged in full time. They don't last long run 24/7 with high wattage draws. Inaba is paying for people to give him positive trust ratings. Is it working? Best of luck getting 6K. 4K is a very decent offer considering all the other available A1 miners in that price range. They have an order queue. Obviously 1400 comes before 899, because '1' comes before '8'. Duh! Don't mix up input wattage with output wattage. Input wattage times efficiency equals output wattage. 996w is the max output wattage. 1040 is the input wattage. 1040 * 89% = 926w, or 1040 * 94% = 978w. It's definitely near the limit, but still under the max.It would be good to replace the power supply. Bitmaintech should offer the S2 without power supply. Trust me. More BTC = More Fun. Does this app need an update for the SSL bug? https://www.kncminer.com/pages/faqWow, they still have that up. That's a little confusing. You forgot to mention that bundle "available in April", doesn't actually ship until August. FTFY. A refund (used to purchase bitcoins if not given directly in bitcoins) will give you more bitcoins than the Neptune will ever mine. I will be impressed if they actually start the hashing (for customers) in June. I didn't expect them to start the hashing until July 1. Although that doesn't change the fact that delivered Neptunes will never break even. A refund now would be far more profitable. Here's a free tip. When you create shipping labels, you can enter the recipient's email address. That way the recipient gets a nice tracking email automatically! No need to hunt through thousands of receipts littering the back seat of your Pinto. Good thing you added that last line, because you are dead wrong. Forks are expected. They will always happen. That is a core feature in how Bitcoin is designed. There's this new Internet thing called YouTube that you can use to demo your 2.4 in mere seconds. You should try it sometime.Although it might be hard to make a video of something that doesn't actually exist. S1 is the best deal right now. Here's my rough estimate on a new S1:http://btcinvest.net/en/bitcoin-mining-profit-calculator.php?diff=6119726089&dcosts=400&diff_mincrease=15&blpbtc=25&dhsmhs=200000&diff_mincreasedecrease=5&btcusd=449.88&dpowcon=400&btcusd_mincrease=0&pcost=.10&calcweeks=26&dleadtime=1&action=calcBreak even in 4 months, but only if you have a decent price on electricity. Summer cooling costs could eliminate any chance of profit. I recommend AMT read over the rules they must follow.http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/bus02-business-guide-mail-and-telephone-order-merchandise-ruleSpecifically this part: This doesn't look like a kit: Good idea. Let me make it easy on you. Fill in the blank:AMT has finished shipping all orders up to #_____.
With difficulty increases, you might earn about 20 btc. I'll let you decide if that's profitable or not. Mblackout got a complete system and was not the first order in the queue. That's special treatment. I don't think you'll get a straight answer. Mblackout received special treatment by picking up her order from AMT. LOL. 25-27 BTC for a broken miner? You could buy cloud mining for that price and not have to worry about maintenance and electricity costs. So, they're bankrupt? They spent all the pre-order funds, and more, and still haven't produced the miners that were sold. That means they're selling every miner at a loss. Not a very good business plan. Don't tell me you actually believe they took out mortgages just for these products. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet They were so close on the S2. Their big mistake was using PCI-type connectors to hold the cards in place. You just can't ship systems like that. The S1 was perfect because each board was firmly bolted to the frame. From the article you kindly posted:HHO generators are a net negative. Worthless. Like snake oil. Yup, probably in that ballpark. But that's not the top. It's going to keep going, and going, and going. A lot of people. Often called "chasing a loss"http://www.gamblingresearch.org/synopses/details.php?id=86 Try: Small Claims Court is super cheap and easy. Max amount is $12k in PA. Biggest cost would be to get to PA for the court date if you lived far away. Once AMT receives the filed court case, I'm sure they would jump at a chance to refund your money immediately. It's a slam dunk case, and they know it. Not possible. They're offering roughly $3/ghps. That's essentially the going cost of hardware. If they have unlimited free electricity, then yes, it's possible. Who here believes they have unlimited free electricity? They might break even for a year. There's no way they'll survive 5 years. Let's go with 180 GH/s atÂ  6 B difficulty and $450 for a starting point and $.15/kwh.Income: $6.75Expense: $1.30S1 is still quite profitable for everyone right now.Go out several months at 20 B difficulty.Income: $2.00Still profitable for nearly everyone. A lot of miners are paying less than $.15.Difficulty isn't that hard to predict. It's going to keep growing at 10%-20% per adjustment for several months. What's quite unpredictable is the exchange rate. It could drop in half or double in mere days. If summer hits and the exchange rate keeps dropping, then a lot of miners are going to hit that unprofitable period. Like you said, miners with high electrical costs are going to need to sell their hardware to miners with low electricity. On the other hand, there's a very good chance of the exchange rate jumping up in a few months, which will keep everyone profitable. Running the numbers, they are just too good to be true. Running miners for 5 years will cost more in electricity than they made from the contract sale. That's not even counting the cost of hardware. They'll only be able to keep paying out as long as they continue receiving new sales. Once the new sales dry up, they will fail. What's that on the upper-left of the table? Did you join the lambos-for-bitcoins club too? Close. Do not run at 15 amp circuit above 1440 watts. Do not run a 20 amp circuit above 1920 watts. And here's the FTC regulations that confirm that AMT is not only illegally delaying orders, but also illegally refusing refunds.http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/bus02-business-guide-mail-and-telephone-order-merchandise-rule Definitely a great idea. That way your money will be sitting in BFL's bank while you wait several months for your hardware. In the meantime, the rest of us miners will be mining away on hardware that is much cheaper and more profitable.In other words, you'd have to be an idiot to order from BFL.
Guess I have to bitch slap you again. Read the damn title you posted.I'm sure you can understand the meaning of the word "wants". Just because he "wants" it, doesn't make it true.What was it you claimed? Let me see...Absolutely wrong, and since you can't handle being corrected, it's pointless to continue arguing with you. Don't bother replying, you're now on /ignore. None of what you said means anything. Why don't you come clean with what order numbers/dates you have shipped so people can see if you are being true to your word or not? Be accountable. Why do you keep making up "facts"? MegaBigPower would be the mine in East Washington, and they're running about 1 PH. that is under 2% of the network. Why do you keep claiming that?https://blockchain.info/poolsNo pool is close to 50%. They obviously meant "or", i.e. "Neptune will ship in either Q1 or Q2." They did that to dupe people into believing that Q1 was a possibility. They were never going to ship in Q1, but they wanted people to think they would, without flat out lying about delivery dates. It worked. Tons of people ordered believing in a false Q1 ship date. California usually gives businesses a lower rate. I would expect about .15/kwh for a business rate there. The crash from the $32 ATH scared me pretty bad. I almost cashed out back then. The crash from $266 ATH was a little uncomfortable, but didn't really scare me. Now the slide from the $12xx ATH has me very excited. The next runup is going to be awesome! Tell me about it! Travel (even domestic) with a credit card is a major pain. Since credit cards are so insecure, the credit card companies panic every time you travel. My cards get frozen nearly every time I travel more than 100 miles from home. Welcome to the forums, Vinny. I enjoyed your piece. And to answer your almost-question: very little, especially in the long term, because the selling pressure from merchants is only half the equation. The other half of the equation is "where did those bitcoins come from that are being sold?" Most people have to buy them, so the selling pressure is nearly balanced by the buying pressure on the other side. The other way is mining. Years ago mining was a signficant part of the market. Now, very little coins are mined compared to volume of coins bought/sold/traded. Now that it's April, I guess it's time to update the list:Oct: "November / DecemberÂ  Â  Initial Shipping"Nov: "November / DecemberÂ  Â  Initial Shipping"Dec: "With that in mind, our current schedule is on track for shippments to begin towards end of year."Jan: "However, this is our second generation, so we have much greater clarity on the process and plan to begin shipments in January 2014."Feb: "However, this is our second generation, so we have much greater clarity on the process and plan to begin shipments in February, 2014."Mar: "However, this is our second generation, so we have much greater clarity on the process and plan to begin shipments in February, 2014."Apr:Â  "However, this is our second generation, so we have much greater clarity on the process and plan to begin shipments in February, 2014." If you pick the sundae, AMT will deliver you a bowl full of sour milk and call it a sundae. Enjoy! LOL. Complaining about a 1% fee when the value of bitcoins is up about 500% from a year ago. Boohoo, that leaves you with only 499% profit! FTFY. You promised a delivery date.You failed to meet that delivery date several times.You promised power and performance specs.You failed to meet those specs.You promised to respond to queries.You failed to respond adequately.You caused the complains to be filed. Don't try to punish customers for your failures. Impressive work Bitmain! Be sure to snap and post a quick photo. We'd love to see how they turned out. Oh, look, saintpaul11's posts have all been deleted.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=305635;sa=showPosts So you sold him a broken miner. Quality business you run there. $3k for only .5 TH/s? No thanks, that's way overpriced. Looking forward to seeing this bounty paid up. You mean this quote?
http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/ Huge farms are built on wholesale/at-cost prices. Yes, those are nicely profitable. But retails prices for most miners are much more expensive, and unlikely to turn a profit in a reasonable amount of time. Overclocking is primarily a linear relationship. Overvolting is exponential. If they are simply overclocking (and not overvolting), then the watts per GH/s will be mostly unchanged. They are off to a decent start. Let's see if they can follow through and deliver on time. They can't beat Bitmain's prices, so they really need to deliver on time. Any delay will be catastrophic to profitability. With bitcoin mining, you either break even in a few months, or you never will. With "average" investments, you may have to wait longer, but eventually you'll break even. Nice mod. Undervolting has a far greater effect than underclocking does on profitability. I'll be looking at doing some undervolting in a few months when summer rolls around. Are you insane too? It went up 20x!!! It didn't "level off" in any way shape or form!!! It's going to keep going another 20x before there's any chance of levelling off happening. It doesn't need to rise at 40%. Even at 20%, Neptune will never break even. Yeah, Bitcoinorama tried to make the same argument.The difficulty is nearly 20x what it was back then when he made that prediction.It's not just Bitmaintech. It's all the A1 clones. And Bitfury. And Spondoolies. Etc. Difficulty is still going up exponentially. It also depends on exchange rate. But at the current exchange rate, Ants with $.12/kwh power are profitable up to about 50 B difficulty! I think the exchange rate is going to go up this year, and a lot of people have power cheaper than $.12, so a lot of S1 Ants will be good to 100 B or more. Nobody said a single batch would do it. Bitmaintech is very good at continous production. They just keep pumping out Ants every day like there's no tomorrow. Well, since I don't think KnC is mining to their own address with non-KnC hardware, the only missing piece is how much hardware did KnC ship to customers. Anyone know? I was going by this report:http://organofcorti.blogspot.se/2014/03/march-16th-2014-weekly-hashrate.htmlKnC 10% of network. Bitmain has already passed 20%. Ok, if you're right about KnC's capacity to deliver, then you're just proving my initial point. Neptune won't break even. There's just too much hashpower coming online in the next few months. It goes to show how fast Bitmain can ramp up production. KnC was never able to pump out the vast quantity of units that Bitmain does. Bump. Let's see some updates. Energy efficiency is starting to become a factor in profitability. You make correcting you so much fun, I just can't resist. The "fime factor" is missing because it cancels itself out. The two terms use miners love to reference are "watts" and "gigahashes per second". Look what happens when you combine them..68 W / (GH/s)multiple both numerator and denominator by s.68 Ws / (GHs/s)simplify (Ws) and (s/s).68 J / GHTada! Sounds like you haven't kept up. In a few short months, Bitmain is powering 20%+ of the entire network! How else can you send money internationally quickly for only a nickel?That said, you are right, Bitcoin is not well suited to micropayments. There's no point in trying to make Bitcoin work for every conceivable use case. There are plenty of other use cases where Bitcoin is unbeatable. That's where future massive adoption is going to come from. Micropayments will best be suited to some off-chain and/or altcoin implementation. Not really. While Tom was very slow at providing refunds (which scared and pissed off a lot of people), he pretty much refunded everyone.
Forget about breaking even. That would have only happened had KnC shipped in Q1. Well, that's not going to happen, so it's over for Neptunes. By the time Neptunes ship, difficulty will be 10B+, at which point a Neptune will generate less than .15 btc per day. That puts RoI at over 3 months without even considering any difficulty increases! Believe me, there's lots of difficulty increases still to come. Bitmain knows how to scale production. They're going to flood the market with 1 TH/s machines before Neptunes even start shipping. I don't think they will. Dave is busy with the massive farm. If he does offer any for sale, they will still be overpriced. Oct: "November / DecemberÂ  Â  Initial Shipping"Dec: "With that in mind, our current schedule is on track for shippments to begin towards end of year."Jan: "However, this is our second generation, so we have much greater clarity on the process and plan to begin shipments in January 2014."Feb: "However, this is our second generation, so we have much greater clarity on the process and plan to begin shipments in February, 2014."These aren't just some quotes printed in some obscure website they have no control over. This is straight from their product page which is used to sell their products. They regularly update the webpage, yet they chose to not update some issues which no longer are true. That places them firmly in "lie" territory. That farm is Bitfury 55nm ASIC blades.I think PG was making a joke about the Monarchs. At least I hope it was a joke. It was pretty funny. No, it didn't. There was no "major dip". Not even close. Um, because they are. Has anyone gotten a refund? Has anyone sued them and gotten their money back? Clearly Meni has never seen the hardware. Where is Adam's review of the hardware?My point still stands. Why were you so desperate to open orders before delivering any actual sample hardware? You should have done that before accepting pre-orders. It looks like a desperate money grab when you take pre-orders before any community member has seen the hardware. But, they promised, IN ALL CAPS even! Just email them. They promise to respond ASAP. You are *not* guaranteing a delivery date. Are telling us that even if you are late to deliver, you will deny all refund requests?  What's your refund policy? Tons of vendors selling 1T Dragons and the like. They're all using A1 chips from Innosilicon. The chips are fine. There are plenty of Chinese vendors with enough skill to build working boards for the exact same chips that Bitmine/AMT are unable to develop. The problem isn't the chips. You'll probably get a letter that you need to pay GST. Get a tracking number from sushi. It's Tuesday again! Think AMT will bless us with another non-update? AMT has been very clear on the delays, and it's not problems with the chips, etc. Read:See, delays are just lack of staff. All you tech-savy people just need to get yourselves to Philly and lend a hand! Not so much "incorrect", but not relevant. People who ship lots of items get large discounts on shipping rates. You on the other hand will be quoted costly "retail" rates. Didn't they promise you 600 watts when you ordered it? 55 watts is an estimate. They don't know for sure what the power usage will be. Estimates are typically quite lower than actual numbers.
That's the old chips. The new chips are priced better. We'll have to wait to see the price of full systems with the new chips before we can call them overpriced. Who has received said MPP? True. It's a good first step. You can use the returned letter in your small claims court suit. Being MIA is almost as bad as being active. Being an owner, he could show up and any time and really mess things up. As long as he is still associated with this project in any way (and he is by still being an owner), I strongly recommend avoiding them at all costs. There are other, respectable, mining companies out there. LOL. Good luck with that. You'll show up at their door, and no one will be home. They're not ever at their "office". Then what?Again, useless. They won't sign for it. People have tried visiting them. They're not there. https://bitmaintech.com/productDetail.htm?pid=000201403150259438234hgMrx380699 Woah! It just dipped down to $630! I got burned by Bitsyncom once before. Not again. I'm sticking with reliable vendors like Bitmain. Sounds about right. Energy costs are becoming significant. That's going to slow down future growth. That is until the next time the exchange rate skyrockets again. It looks pretty bad when your "founders" don't list your company name in their Linked-in profiles. Or you can get them for $155 less, each, by several official sellers, like https://www.112bit.com/product/antminer-s1-dual-blade/. Seriously? They send multi-thousand dollar checks by untracked postal letters? Monumental liars or idiots, I can't tell which. They do? Are you sure? BFL is really good at underestimating power usage. Wait, you sent gmaxwell Federal Reserve Notes??? If you didn't send Federal Reserve Notes, then it makes absolutely no difference what is written on them, because you didn't send him any. Ah, yes, HashFast_CL can't handle debate. Reply and lock the thread. Good thing that won't shut people up.No, it wasn't a post on a forum. It was an email sent by an official HashFast account to a customer asking for clarification of the Terms of Service. It will be very valid in a court. Will you post a list of those blocks? Full nodes will download all the blocks from the genesis block to the current block. There are algorithms "stronger" than sha-256, not because sha-256 is brute-forceable, but because there is may be an undiscovered weakness. Here's the contract.Who was refunded 105% BTC? No one? That's the breach. Yes, complying with the terms of a sale are tiresome. It's so much easier to breach the contract and keep the money and not deliver the goods. It's so much more profitable too!
Nope. Read carefully. Deals denominated in something other than fiat currency are not new. I think the law is just fine. For example, a judge ordered CoinLab to deliver bitcoins to Bitvestment, and not some USD-equivilent.http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/11/07/judge-orders-coinlab-to-pay-up-in-bitcoin/ I know you want that to be true because HashFast screwed up so badly, but it's not true. HashFast promised full BTC refunds for any reason if they were late. They were late, therefore they must offer full BTC refunds. Look up classic "if...then..." logic to understand fully what's going on. 160 GH/s should draw 320 watts.The file to edit is "/etc/config/asic-freq". ssh to the unit and edit that file. You can search the forum for more details. They usually ship within 2 days after you order, then another 2-3 days to arrive at your location. Yes. Over/underclocking gives a roughly linear result. If 180 GH/s draws 360 watts, then overclocking to 200 GH/s draws 400 watts, and underclocking to 150 GH/s draws 300 watts. These are just estimates, because things like PSU efficiency changes depending on power draw, and other little details. Sorta depends on if you want to overclock them. A good 750 PSU should be able to drive 2 Ants at stock clocks (roughly 650 watts output). Ah, you found a new term in the dictionary, "buyer's remorse". Another nice term that has absolutely no bearing on this case. HashFast promised full BTC refunds if they were late. Need me to post proof again? The customer is entitled to a full BTC refund, for any reason, because HashFast failed to deliver on time. So what you're saying is, HashFast representatives lie when necessary to protect the company. Gotcha. Doesn't matter if you call it a "windfall" or not, BTC refunds for BTC purchases were the original agreement by HashFast: I'll do that for them since they're busy "building miners".Next promised shipping dates "March 17, 18, 19". Guess what it'll be. 105% of BTC97.95849881 is BTC102.856423751. When is HashFash sending gmaxwell BTC102.856423751 refund?  Seriously? Next you're going to posit that Satoshi used a private key based on the serial number of a $1 in his pocket. Hey, it's possible! Quick, everyone, check your $1 bills! You might have the key to Satoshis Stash! No! Don't say "in two weeks". You'll jinx them! Not true with the existing designs. Bitfury's are 55nm, and they are lower power than anything else available.  You're one of the first to get the new 1.2 units! What's the power draw? How many BTC have you mined by now? LOL, why? With the S2 you'll get an extra couple months of mining in. They say it's a 4U case. Other than that, I couldn't care less how it looks. It's not going to be sitting on my coffee table. It's going to be buried in closet/hosting facility.
Disappointing. That's going to make ROI calculations much more complicated. S1 is still great if you have cheap power. 28nm vs 55nm means nothing. All that matters is "up-front cost", "date of delivery", and "power draw". S2 wins against every other product on the market. Nah, they have their own chip.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=515448.01 TH/s @ 1000 watts, shipping Apr 1st, for $3900. S1 is cheaper up-front, but higher power draw. S2 is more expensive up-front, but with lower power draw will be able to run longer. Both are decent offers. The censorship continues:Clearly HashFast knows they screwed up getting caught with the lies. Ack, people, do your homework. Cancel that order. Here's just one good example. There are several more. Ants are the best, but that reseller is a rip-off. Either get them from bitmaintech.com, or one of the good resellers. Any miner including such transactions in their own blocks would be starting their own fork. No one else will accept their blocks. Hello sockpuppet. What's your main username?  LOL! "In two weeks." Now where have I heard that before... Hehe. Yeah, I'm 99% Buy and Hold. I play with 1% from time to time for a little excitement and entertainment, but it is rarely profitable. I'd have far more BTC if I took my own advice. Good point. Reselling it is a bit risky, but definitely could turn a profit.Cool, thanks for pointing that out. I'll have to drop by there next time I'm over there. Keep dreaming. Your ROI is already long gone. Miners are now under $3/gh, and that's already borderline profitable. Bitmine is extremely overpriced, and there's very little chance they will ever break even. So true. While I would prefer to have an unused miner, the truth is these products aren't going to be running very long. It's very unlikely any pre-mining will effect reliability, and thus customer profits. I just want my unit shipped ASAP, which they do. XBC is taken.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Unit_of_Account_9 Bitmine says they own it. Innosilicon says Bitmine licensed it. Innosilicon isn't a brand new company. Bitmine is. I'd give the benefit of the doubt to Innosilicon. Doubtful. Innosilicon was the one who actually engineered the chip. You could try sewing him for it.
I'll let Bruce educate you.No, it's not going to happen in a few decades. It will never happen. Wow! Not Bitmine, but Bitmain. An unfortunately too similar name, but Bitmain pwns. Something that could to that internationally would be worth thousands of dollars per unit. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=378936.0 Go ahead. Extrapolate a decade or two. In fact, go ahead and extrapolate to the theoretically limits of the perfect computer harnessing the entire energy of the sun. You still can't even count to 2^256, let alone do the calcuations to brute force a Bitcoin private key. Re-read the graphic in post #2. Agreed. With Bitmain dropping the prices so low, the cost of the PSU is becoming significant. Bitmain. They actually deliver when they say they will. That's way better than shipping late with a minor speed increase since difficulty goes up way more than 10% every 10 days. I wonder if it is Tuesday yet in PA. US law does not *require* refunds to be in US dollars. Businesses are free to "barter" for payments of services and products. I don't like a 5-month ROI. But I think your 30% adjustment estimate is too high. We haven't had a 30% yet this year. Rerun your estimate with 20% adjustments. Yup. Phone numbers don't work. Email addresses don't work. Physical address doesn't exist. Server hosted in Slovakia. Go ahead and call this one.SCAM. Actually they don't. Excellent. Let's see a photo of it. How do you people find these random companies??? In other words, they haven't shipped squat. They're busy trying to get them to work. So you purchased/licensed your chips from Innosilicon? Can you post a picture of the bare chips you use? All future difficulty estimates are just that, estimates, but at a price of 1 BTC there's a really good chance these will make positive ROI (because you can have them up and mining in just a few days from when you order). That is true for under-volting, not for under-clocking. Can the S1 be easily under-volted? Obligitory XKCD:
The only way you'll see a major hashrate drop will be after Bitcoin is already dead. The price to beat is $3/gh. How fast do your cards run? Yes, they gave definitive dates. No. Think of it the other way around. The devices pulls only as much power as it needs from the power supply. The power supply does not force power into the device. That order was promised to ship 2 weeks ago! Have they contacted you with the reasons for the delays? Let's play, Shipped or Not Shipped!Shipped out before 2/21...Not shipped out by 2/25.What's your vote? Shipped or Not Shipped? Are you new to the Internet? Please stop with the shouting. The moderators will start removing your posts if you continue.  The "updates" are filled with lies.5 batches claimed to have shipped by now, yet not a single confirmed delivery. The new Bitfury chip sounds good. 25% faster, 25% less power. Keep an eye out for it. If it comes out at a reasonable price it'll be a winner. I know this thread moves pretty fast, but you've got to keep up. Nobody cares if AMT is incorporated in DE. They are doing business illegally in PA while using another company's name. Thank you for waiting for your miners. My Ants are generating more and more bitcoins with every day you wait! You're confusing "registered" with "incorporated". Yes, they can incorporate in any state, but before they start doing business in another state, they are a foreign corporation and need to register with the state. This is especially important for a state with a sales tax, like PA. I'm sure the city they are doing business in also requires them to obtain a business license.Feel free to read over some of the legalese:http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=15&div=0&chpt=41Even worse, AMT is doing business under someone else's name.https://www.corporations.state.pa.us/corp/soskb/Corp.asp?868855 Why are you not registered in PA? It is illegal to conduct business in a state without registering with the local/state government. Is this so that you can avoid paying state taxes? Rather than wasting your time posting worthless ramblings, all you have to do is simply post what order #/payment date you have shipped up to. But that would require you to actually be shipping miners, so I don't expect you'll do so. Add in an overkill power supply for $99 and it's still cheaper. Case not needed. If you really need to host your miner in your baby's crib, I recommend some other product. So the Ant is cheaper. Thanks for confirming my facts.And you forget the most important factor. Delivery date. Order the Ants and they'll be delivered in a few days. Order AMT, and they may deliver it someday. That delivery date more than makes up for the minor electricity draw difference. Why would you do that? Antminers are cheaper and ship sooner. It must be nice being so rich you can just throw money away. What's the point when Ants are doing 200 GH/s for under $800 and are actually in-stock? Can you show the chip working at 800 GH/s?
That's why all the smart miners order from Bitmain. Here's how they did it.1. Develop ASIC with company funds2. Sell in-stock ASICs Another month bites the dust, and no Monarch.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6_1Pw1xm9U Why? They are late and over-priced. They lie about specs. They lie about shipping. Why would you want to support a company like that? Well, they don't really have a license to do business there. Well, this forum hasn't been around 5 years, but a few of us have been here a very long time. You have no need to apologize. An upstanding business has an address and you have every right, especially as a customer, to feel free to knock on their doors. That's what they said in 2009.That's what they said in 2010.That's what they said in 2011.That's what they said in 2012.That's what they said in 2013.That's what you say in 2014.Notice a pattern? The point is this:They said they would! Why is it so unreasonable to expect companies to follow through on their word? Since you're new here, you may not realize we've already been over this. While they can incorporate in another state, they need to be registered in the state they are doing business.http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=15&div=0&chpt=41Where's their Certificate of Authority?Even worse, their website lists "Copyright Â© 2013Â  Advanced Mining Technology Inc", which in fact is the name of a real business in PA, a real dig-in-the-dirt mining business registered some 20+ years ago. US Senator predicts massive growth in bitcoin value in the coming years.CCMF! All right, all orders from 500-600 are now shipped. Who's got a tracking number? Of course it was, but that was way back in 2011. Ah, I see, they're trying to EULA access to their Server. That's fine, they can do whatever they want to their Server. I don't have to use it. The GPL prevails, and I can use the app and/or sources however I wish, as long as I don't use their Server. It's definitely an improvement.No. I refuse to agree to any EULA to use GPL softare. Period. A whole week to produce a video. This is going to be one awesome video. I wonder if they have any Bitcoin celebrities starring in it! Streetview from 2011: http://goo.gl/maps/LJ4k2 Price is too high. Ants are cheaper and deliver sooner. If anyone has good hash, it's the Mile High City. Dear Giorgio,I too would like to buy some units and skip the line and have them produced immediately screwing over every other customer that ordered before me. What is the cost for that? None. Difficulty will be far too high by the time you receive it. You'd be lucky to get 10 btc.
Proof of EmptyGox Whether the evil genius was inside or outside, Mark was in on it. There's absolutely no way all their cold wallets could be drained without them noticing. Where did you hear Mark sing? Yes, it does need to be limited. Every output, even in the coinbase transaction, takes up bytes, and the blocksize has a very hard limit. It can vary alot based on the chip complexity, but that could be about average. Lots do. Bitmain is really good about shipping, but not so good about communication. There's nothing tricky about it. If they use any of Andreas' GPL sources, then their code is also GPL. KnCWallet by definition is open source and the sources must be released. Furthermore, the EULA they require is illegal for a GPL project. You forget the most important calculation. When the hashing starts. Since the Ant costs $400/year extra in hosting, if it starts hashing 2 weeks earlier, it more than makes up the extra hosting cost and overall is a more profitable solution. KnC Wallet appears to be an illegal fork. Not only is the source not available, but the terms of service include many terms that violate the GPL license.http://www.kncwallet.com/terms.htm I don't see a link to the sources. It is based on GPL sources, and thus must be made available. Just saw the price at 112bit. Very good! There you go! Nice price. Your loss. Antminers will earn more profit than any other product available. 3x 200 GH/s units is the same as 1x 600 GH/s unit.In stock and will ship in the next day or two: https://bitmaintech.com/productDetail.htm?pid=00020140107162747992Ce5uBuxW06D6Unbeatable deal. Period. I can't find the source to KnC Wallet. Anyone have a link to it? The Monarch delivered months from now is far more expensive than something with slightly higher price delivered immediately, like Bitmain Antminers. Registered a whole 11 days ago. Listen to him! He knows. I'm pretty sure that 70 BTC will always be worth more than 45 BTC.Then I have a deal for you! Send me 100 of your old BTC, and I'll send you back 50 brand new BTC. But wait, I can make it even more exciting! I'll send you up to 10 brand new BTC every month for 12 months. You'll never know how much BTC I'll send you! It's possible (but not guaranteed) that you'll end up with more BTC than you spent. Just imagine the excitement! There's 2 ways to get bitcoins, buy them or mine them. I'm having a hard time seeing how getting 46 BTC rather than 70 BTC is offseting the risk. Why would you want to mine less than you can buy? We'll know in the next day or two what boards they are using. Since they shipped orders 400 to 500, I'm sure there's a few customers that will post here what they received. Ouch! Is it really that bad? Had you simply bought BTC you'd have 70+ BTC. That's nearly a -50% ROI.
Delivering a miner late is like delivering a wedding cake 2 days after the wedding. Agreed. Maybe BA should create an official moderated thread where they could post such announcements... Of course they're lying. Why did they quote "Q1/Q2"? Q1 was never a possibility. They needed to secure a lot of sales so they could fund their farm. After that, they don't need you silly customers ever again.See you mid May.  Exactly. The presence of AltCoins has about as much effect on Bitcoins as Zimbabwe dollars effect US dollars. It doesn't matter how many Trillion Altcoins are out there, they aren't accepted at LamboNB, they aren't accepted at Gyft, they aren't accepted at Overstock, they aren't accepted at TigerDirect, etc. Send me your private key and I'll print it on a block on my 3D printer. You're kidding, right? Q1/Q2 delivery is what was promised. There's 0% chance they're going to start a hosting plan before the end of Q2. Most people these days own a smartphone. These devices can be used to capture photographs. Then you can post said photograph to a free website like http://imgur.com/. The whole process takes about 30 seconds. You should consider hiring someone with a modern technology skillset. Here's the latest disrespect earning episode:They didn't ship on Wednesday, and they haven't owned up to this fact. They are disrespecting their customers by not coming clean with the delays. They deserve no respect. PG, it looks like you're running out of new material here. Why don't you hop on over to the AMT thread? There's a wealth of new dirt to dig up over there! Hey, stop bumping this thread. Each time I see it bumped I think they're announcing having shipped something.Crap, now I just bumped it. Sorry! It's the same bitcoins going back and forth.Back and forth like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58-atNakMWwVery few Apple shares haven't traded on the open market. Apple insiders only own about .1% now.https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/fundamentals/ownership.jhtml?stockspage=ownership&symbols=aapl Well, in the case of a stock, each share has been purchased at least once (at the IPO) and then traded some number of times for varying amounts of cash. There was never a Bitcoin IPO. The vast majority of bitcoins have never been purchased at any price. Only a small fraction of mined coins ever make it to an exchange. But multiplying the number of mined coins times the current price at an exchange gives a totally bogus number. Bitcoin is not a stock. There is no "market cap". It only takes 5 antminers. It's by far the most cost effective miner. For someone so well educated, you sure don't know the basics of what Ponzi and Pyramid schemes are. While it may not be a BAD idea, it is a very bad price. ROFLMAO. What have you been smoking?http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/8/prweb11035951.htm https://forums.butterflylabs.com/monarch-discussion/7827-2014-feb-05-monarch-discussion-2.html#post76687https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6_1Pw1xm9U Well, that makes it official.
* Syke checks his wallet.Yup, it's all still there. Not a single satoshi missing. What damage? They've said that dozens of times before. It'll pass. I think you meant to say Technobit is the real deal. All AMT does is buy Lian Li cases and put Technobit boards in it. If the scale is not linear you'll have people gaming the system. If the reward benefits small miners, the big miners will split up their wallets to look like small miners. If the reward benefits big miners, small miners will join up to become big miners. Buying bitcoins on Gox is risky, but could be quite profitable.So who are these crazy people that are selling bitcoins on Gox?! Why are people trading on Gox? You can't withdraw fiat, you can't withdraw bitcoins. All you can do is trade and lose all your funds to fees. They said you can "convert" your order to cloud hashing. In no logical interpretation would "converting" an order mean you get both cloud hashing *and* the device. They said you can "convert" your order to cloud hashing. In no logical interpretation would "converting" an order mean you get both cloud hashing *and* the device. Their shipping is *aways* inaccurate. Monarch was due in November, then December, then January, then February. They do not have working chips. You will not receive it when they say you will. $1200??? I'll be back when BTC breaks $1000. At the current BTC rates, that price is a massive loss. Well, to get high efficiency, you need to run chips at a very slow speed. Getting high hashrate and high efficiency will require many chips, which makes for a very expensive option. While that is technically possible, it's naive to think KnC is going to be selling Neptunes at a loss. Yes, that's the biggest issue. The shrink from 28nm to 20nm will give roughly a 25% improvement. If they tried to do 6 TH/s, it will be because they are using many more chips, and it would be expensive, and the power draw would be in the 5,000+ watt range. That's simply not going to work. Yes!!! For many reasons. You do realize that only a handful of 20nm projects have taped-out, ever? KnC isn't yet one of them, you can bank on that. I'd like to understand how that worked. In 4 minutes, your TX should have propogated across the whole network. I don't see how a mutated TX could have beat yours to the pools unless the attacker mined the block himself. The mutated TX must have been transmitted before the 4 minutes. None. They were late, even though they were using a tried and true 28nm process. 20nm is brand new cutting edge process. No way is 20nm going to be early. Of course it is being manipulated! Why wouldn't it be? There are ways to improve PoS, but the PoS has to be smarter than simply accepting any zero-confirm transaction. It needs to analyze the network and the transaction: how well it is connected to peers, if it sees any malling/double-spending of the current transaction, if a fee was included, if there is a chain of unconfirmed inputs, etc. Yes!Not necessarily. It could just as easily be someone who loves bitcoins, and is ready to buy a bunch at a great price. I for one am loving the price drop. It's allowing me to stock up on more bitcoins! 
No thanks.Sure, call Verisilicon China and ask. Do you realize there's only 600,000 available transactions per day total? If everyone who downloaded bitcoin.exe was getting daily payouts, there'd be no room for actual peer to peer transactions. Everyone who uses bitcoin cannot be a miner. You've been around here a while. You should know by now that BFL *never* delivers when they say they will. I'm looking for a little under $5/gh right now. Of course that's for something delivered in the next week or so. Yes, they were able to run it stable about two hours. So they snapped a quick video and it hasn't been stable since. That's extremeley discomforting to see. Since AMT hasn't shipped, I can only assume you've never mined before, so let me explain some mining to you. Shares submitted to a pool occur based on a random distribution. If you showed a flat-line chart like the first one you drew, I'd know you had faked the chart. A true "stable" chart is going to have a good +/- 20% variance and look like the second one you drew. The video showed they started up, reached 1 TH for the first time, then quickly ended the video. You can almost hear the guy in the background whisper, "quick, shut it off before it burns up". The pools stats clearly show, they are unable to maintain 1 TH for any reasonable amount of time.Doesn't matter if it is 1 miner or 1000 miners. You tried to blame the pool for the stability problems noted in the Bitmine chart. This part:Don't blame the pool. Bitmine's inability to maintain 1 TH is their problem, not the pool. Don't worry about the difficulty, it levelled off 4 months ago. If Bitcoinorama was still around, he'd tell you the same thing: LOL. That's the point. Bitmine's miner is not stable, and you cannot blame that on the pool like you tried to do.Out of 168 hours last week that miner had 2 hours poor performance. Out of those same 168 hours, the Bitmine miner had 166 hours of poor performance. No wonder Bitmine's demo video only lasted a couple minutes.You're right. That's not AMT's miner. Here's a graph of AMT's miner._______________________________________________ Here's what a stable 1 TH/s system looks like:http://eligius.st/~wizkid057/newstats/userstats.php/1FT66kMTmFzVVzphfTeU1q1wec7QnmfWCQHere's Bitmine's unstable 1 TH/s on the same pool at the same timehttp://eligius.st/~wizkid057/newstats/userstats.php/1BA1Y3xvLbSYU9TqcxUspXzEn1roSStCVrDon't try blaming the pool. It's obviously not the pool's fault. Which is a real shame. You have a fine product. It's not "legacy" by any means. The only problem is the price. Since you can't meet the going $5/gh rate, we'll look forward to the next gen. Hopefully that will bring you back into a competitive price range. Yes, that is possible, but that's nothing new. Accepting with zero-confirm transactions is risky. What's the address of your work space? No need to sort. Don't forget to check amounts. Pretty well done scam. You went too far in this part:Next time stick with more reasonable claims and you'll be able to scam more poeople. Smart move! You don't need to rewrite it. The new specs are only valid for orders placed after today. All previous orders must receive the stated specs at the time the order was placed. It is fair. They claim +/- 10%, you want to have -10% on hashrate *and* +10% on power draw which is the absolute most extremely lenient way to deliver. You can have both and be fair. Honestly, what's the point? Are you trying to prove Matt has never hosted miners in MO or CO? Keep fudging the numbers. Eventually you'll be right.+/- 10% hashrate and +/- 10% power draw is not what they are selling. They are selling 1.2 TH/s at 600-900 watts. If they do not meet or exceed both specs, then they have failed to deliver what was ordered.Edit: Now I see the "+/- 10% variance" fine print. At the very extreme 1080 GH/s and 990 watts is still going to be quite a stretch. Including the "600" watt quote is very deceptive.
You're right, the are actually selling 1.2 TH @ 600-900 watts. How much are you willing to bet they deliver that? It's a nuisance, like when too much dust was being passed around. It'll pass. If you don't like those TXs, then don't include them in the blocks you mine. Ants are by far the best deal at this moment. But whether they can break-even is questionable. Difficulty continues to rise exponentially, which means you only have a few weeks to break even before income drops too low to make a difference. Neptune is way over-priced. p2pool and solo miners are insignificant (unfortunately). Connect to the top 2-3 pools and you're golden. They probably took the avalon masks and resized them and printed out new chips at their in-house 28nm foundry. CTS Miner did something similar. Watch the video again. The pool auto-adjusts the difficulty. When they reach stable performance of about 209 GH/s the difficulty is 512. Isn't it far more important to be connected to the pools? Most miners don't actually receive transactions, but receive blocks from their pools. You have two likely scenarios:A) Buy 1 BTC now. In a year you'll have 1 BTC.B) Buy a miner now. In a year you'll have .8 BTC.Which sounds better to you? All you have to do is clear up the discrepencies. Why won't you post your PA business registration?Isn't that what you said 2 weeks ago? Bitmain units are all in-stock. Order from them now you'll have it next week. Best of luck with that. $12,000 will get you 2.4 TH/s from other manufacturers. Whenever I want to receive bitcoins, I give the sender a unique address. I couldn't care less what the TXID is. I think most merchants work the same way. Malled transactions do not change the addresses. AMT is clearly not a legitimate business. Legitimate businesses are registered with the state and pay taxes and follow regulations. From all appearances, they do not meet those requirements.AMT is a few amateurs that may or may not deliver. Best of luck to those that paid them. Note that pierred has never reporting even receiving a 4th board. Let's assume he did. Can you do basic math? How many 40 GH/s boards does it take to reach 192 GH/s? pierred 192GH/s miner only hashed at 120GH/s. They are also misrepresenting the power consumption, and who knows what else.http://advancedminers.com/bitcoin-mining-hardware/1-2ths-bitcoin-miner/We all know this is not true! Look at who relayed the blocks to get an idea (although not proof) if a pool is in on it.Relayed by BTC Guild.Relayed by GHash.IO.How about the rest? Gox creates a withdrawal and makes note of the TXID. Then, before it is included in a block, someone else changes the transaction such that only the TXID changes, but the transaction is still the same. When the new TXID gets included in the blockchain, the customer who requested the withdrawal claims they never received it. But they actually did! Gox looks up the old TXID and doesn't find it, so they create a whole new transaction and send another withdrawal to the customer. The customer has now been paid twice!!! This is solely Gox's problem because they do not correctly track transactions.
Malled transactions cannot steal coins.MtGox is losing coins because they are allowing customers to perform a withdrawal, claim they never received it, and then MtGox manually sends them a new withdrawal!Does your exchange do that? It's been easily done with Bitfury boards since last August. Ok, where's their PA registration? Anyone doing business in PA is required to register their business as such. It doesn't matter where they are incorporated. Are they doing business in PA illegally? Yes, AMT should explain themselves.Ok... explain to me this.https://advancedminers.com/https://www.corporations.state.pa.us/corp/soskb/Corp.asp?868855That's a match. They are using that business name. It's not my mistake. I've been waiting 4 months for this promised "levelling off" to occur.Difficulty in Oct: 250MDifficulty in Feb: 2600M10x increase! Anybody claiming the difficulty is going to level off in the next few months is an idiot. Well, they're operating out of PA, so they have to be registered there.https://www.corporations.state.pa.us/corp/soskb/Corp.asp?868855Who's that company? Wrong again.http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1u4v0o/i_sued_bfl_in_kansas_jurisdiction_and_won/ If it can mine bitcoins successfully, then it is fully functioning.Yes there are. I do not trust them to give unbiased reports. I do not read product reviews from reporters that accept gifts due to the conflicts gifts cause.You are right in one thing, I haven't been given any gifts. Jealous? Not a bit. I've been mining since long before BFL even existed. I don't need gifts. Yes, that is the problem. Gox built their doors out of rice paper. People are walking right through them.Gox has a flawed implementation. They allow customers who have already received a withdrawal to claim they didn't, and Gox will send them a new withdrawal! Yup, that's the first half. Here's the other half:http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/bus02-business-guide-mail-and-telephone-order-merchandise-rule You're not listening. MtGox built their own subway with flawed doors. Only MtGox can fix those doors. How could he? The flaw is in MtGox's closed-source implementation and customer service policies. Not Bitcoin. FTFY. We all know BFL doesn't know how to estimate power usage. WRONG. A pre-order purchase is a contract. BA made a commitment to deliver on a specified date. If they cannot meet that date, their customers deserve the right to cancel that contract due to BA's failure to deliver. Especially in the US, it is the law. Which is even more proof. The X1 & X3 cannot be "fantastic". Being so late makes them horrible. Whether BFL specifically said "post pro-BFL" or not, he was paid off. He was given a new, fully functional miner at no cost. So when he tries to imply impartiality by claiming "I wasn't paid to post", it's deceitful.That sounds like an RMA routine, quite reasonable. BFL was never forced (by random strangers) to accept pre-orders. They chose to accept pre-orders all on their own.I was giving you the chance to be honest. Not surprised you didn't take it. bcp19 was given free hardware by BFL. His "I'm not paid to post here" isn't the full truth. Which miner would you buy?A) $5/gh delivered next weekB) $3/gh delivered in three months Oh, right, people here *forced* BFL to accept pre-orders. Please explain, how does an anonymous forum poster force a company to accept pre-order funds?Remind us again, did BFL give you free hardware? I sure hope so. Just keep in mind that Bitmain is shipping in-stock units at $5/gh.
Let's see, I know Bitfury designed his own chip. ASICMiner did too. As did Avalon. I think Bitmain did too. In fact, many ASIC manufacturers designed their own chips. Since there are good lawyers and bad lawyers, the truth of whether he is a lawyer or not isn't important. What is important is his reasoning, and his reasoning on the FTC rules makes a lot of sense. Don't waste your time. Click his ignore button like everyone else has done. Delivery is scheduled for "Q1/Q2". There's no way they are starting the hosting before end of Q2. You do realize by now that Q1 delivery is impossible, don't you? Of course!http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/Since it is now February, I'm sure they shipped a ton of them, as promised. No, no, no. Do not run a circuit at 100% 24/7. You max 80% continous load. 15 amp circuit: 12A @ 120V = 1440W.20 amp circuit: 16A @ 120V = 1920W. Remind me, how many millions of dollars of pre-order funds has WASP collected? Why buy used? New Antminers go for about $1200 (1.45 btc). Don't worry, it'll be available "in two weeks." That's a pretty reasonable number. Bitmain comes close. Bitfury is double that. Disappointingly overpriced. Ah, so now the "home" miner is a "professional" miner. More worthless buzzwords.CT is "professional". Irrelevent to profitability.CT is liquid cooled. Irrelevent to profitability.CT has several fans. Irrelevent to profitability.CT has a pretty aluminum case. Irrelevent to profitability.CT has some big power supplies. Irrelevent to profitability.CT might have some certifications. Irrelevent to profitability.Get the picture? I'm talking the only thing that matters. Profitability. How much does it cost vs. how much it generates. Hard numbers that aren't buzzwords. Bitmain may not be sexy, pretty, cool. But when it comes to profitability, it blows CT away. There's no reasonable way to run the numbers and come to any other conclusion. Anyone placing an order today for CT is *wasting* money. A lot of money. This is why I love reading this forum. You fanbois are quite humorous. 2100 watts, requires a extension cord from another circuit in another part of the house to be dragged across the floor to power the unit. Home use? LOL! I'll chose "obsolute" hardware that makes a profit over a pretty box that doesn't, any day of the week. That would be acceptable. In fact, MegaBigPower did that when they had a delay on a batch. Free express shipping, arrives in a few days. I completely agree! Antminer is for people who care about profitability. CT is for people who like wasting money on fancy boxes. https://bitmaintech.com/productDetail.htm?pid=00020140107162747992Ce5uBuxW06D6 Couldn't happen to a better company. Way to miss the point. CT is highly overpriced. CT = $3/GH, Bitmain = $6/GH. The difficulty is going up way more than 2x in 3 months. I guarantee it. Dare to bet on it?

That's at least 3 months away, difficulty will go up 10x in that time. So 200 GH/s now is equal to 2 TH/s in May. You can get 200 GH/s now for just over $1000. Why would you throw away $5000??? Doubtful. In the rare chance BA eventually produces a product, it will be not be competitive with all the other options in the market.Â  Not to mention all the lies about the schedule. It's game over for BA. There's no point in continuing the project. Delivered in a about a week: https://bitmaintech.com/product.htmWho cares about "next gen". That's a worthless buzzword. All that matters is profitability. When does the 25% rental hashrate start?Do people who ordered from resellers get the same offer? Wow, I didn't think I'd be so right, so soon. Good one. Here's another.CT was hired to build a Formula One race car that is promised to reach over 200 mph. Instead, they deliver a car that can only reach 160 mph. Sure, it's a fast car compared to a Yugo, but the lost profits from not being able to win races is staggering. Why not 80%? That was your offer: Why do you people keep wasting your money with BFL? Are you so rich you have so much money you don't know what to do with it all? There's something seriously wrong when blackarrow is online and checking the forums, but hasn't provided any updates in nearly two months.Last post: December 09, 2013Last active: TodayI'll remind everyone of this post on Feb 25 (or sooner if they announce their delays) when BA is officially late. With difficulty +100% due to delayed shipment. It sucks to get ripped-off, but what he did was place a great big gamble, and lost. That most assuredly does not deserve donations!I'm going to go play SatoshiDice. Will you set up some donations for me too? I might lose a ton of bitcoins. Difficulty is up 2x since mid-December. Is everyone getting delivered double the hashrate immediately? No. While it's better than nothing, it's not even close to fair compensation for the delays. It's quite a shame. Good chips, in stock. At the right price these would fly off the shelves. I can't imagine sales doing well at these prices. Stack 5 ants together you have 1 TH/s. Some fancy form factor is not what makes a profit. A new PCB or chip that reduces power draw or improves price and performance is what is most important. http://www.scc.virginia.gov/clk/befaq/fict.aspx#a4Wow, how does free enterprise survive under such onerous requirements!http://www.scc.virginia.gov/clk/befaq/fict.aspx#a7Jail time doesn't sound harmless to me. Yeah, and you need to officially register a DBA if you're going to do that. This is not optional. "Copyright Â© 2014 nTek Computers"How does a "brand" copyright something? I strongly suggest you stop implying nTek is a company and make it right. I don't think Virginia will approve of how you are doing business. How did you switch on the power supply? There are setup threads in the Custom Hardware subforum. That is good news. KnC might be able to ship in Q2 if all goes well. Ignore the haters, but pay close attention to the sceptics. There are a lot around here, for very good reason. Now you really know why a lot of people give the hardware vendors a hard time. So often they fail and/or are purposefully scamming people.
MPP started Oct 30. Add 90 days and you get Jan 28th! MPP tomorrow! At $.15/kwh that's $1314 per year. 1.6 TH/s generates that in under 5 days.But if you're worried about power draw, you're better off using Bitfury chips until someone comes along with a more efficient chip. No one has shown a 28nm chip with better power drawn that Bitfury's 55nm chip. Did you really just compare CT with KNC? KNC delivered 2 weeks late with 50% greater hashrate. Customers were fairly compensated.CT is delivering 2 months late, at -20% hashrate. Ouch!!! Batch 1 might start mining Feb '14. Those cost $15,750 and are thus going to be a huge loss due to the delay. Who knows when Batch 2 will ship. Good question. Who is Nimbus?http://www.nimbusmining.com/termshttp://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResults/EntityName/NimbusMining/Page1No "NimbusMining LLC" registered in Florida.http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/20201-E-Country-Club-Dr-APT-1502-Aventura-FL-33180/64664531_zpid/Million dollar condo. Nice. I guess that $40/gigahash business is paying off very well! They donated a small portion of it to charities. They rest they "donated" to themselves. Correct.Incorrect. BFL is obviously selling it, on their website, using their own shopping cart,Â  and the payment goes straight to BFL. By all definitions BFL is selling the product. /ignored. What does that mean? I understand *withdrawing* money from your bank account for bitcoins, but how do you *deposit* money into a bank for bitcoins? Do banks now sell bitcoins? A standard clocked Bitfury rig from MegaBigPower runs 400 GH/s at 350 watts at the wall. Big deal.KnC, 28nm, 1w per GH/s.Bitfury, 55nm, .9w per GH/s.KnC's chip is nothing to brag about. Read their claims carefully.You really believe they have a secret 20nm foundry? If there is a secret 20nm fab, it sure as hell isn't CMS's. Compare both to Bitfury's 55nm chip well under .9 watts per GH/s at the wall and the C in KnC stands for clown also. 20%??? What happened to:Sounds like you missed the power target by quite a bit more than 20%. Help me out, I must be missing it. Which one of those is a 20nm fab? You think their foundry taped-out weeks ago and put the wafers into production yet never notified them? Seriously? Unfortunately, no news means you have not taped-out. Please explain how you can still be on track. There's a limit to how fast wafers can be produced. They always miss their target. You can count on it. Looks pretty close to 1W per GH/s.
Is this company actually incorporated anywhere? People are wising up, realizing that Q1 was never actually a possibility. It's a lot more clear now that a Q2 delivery is unprofitable. So please, don't request a refund. It's more coins for me. Does have to be a single machine? Why not just get 5-10 200 GH/s machines? That's your best availability *and* price now. Think again. $40k gets you 5 TH delivered next week. By the time you get the Neptunes, difficulty will be much higher. 5 TH now is far more profitable than 12 TH several months from now. One of two things has happened since their last update.1. They taped-out and have a chance to still deliver on time.2. They missed the tape-out date and thus cannot deliver on time.99% chance #2 has happened. By the beginning of Q2 $2000 is already too expensive. By late-Q2 it'll be horrible. Edit one file and it'll do 200, easy. You can pick up 400 GH/s now for 3.8 BTC. How many BTC did your Baby Jet cost? That's why Bitmain is the go-to manufacturer. They are shipping 180-200 GH/s units immediately, for 1.9 BTC. Why pay more for something delivered nearly a month from now?! That would be a decent price if they were actually in-stock and shipped immediately. But they're quoting 3-weeks until shipping, at which point it's a pretty bad deal. Who paid 6.6 BTC for the first batch??? https://megabigpower.com/shop/ should accept credit cards, and they ship immediately. Always happy to help. Let me try to boost your sales again.BFL: 230 GH/s for $4255, may ship soon, $18.5 per GH/s.Bitmain: 180 GH/s for $1586 (1.9 btc @ $835), ships within days, $8.8 per GH/s.Buy BFL! They're twice as expensive! I bought pizza for bitcoins for lunch on Friday. I'm pretty regular. Guess the price is not too high after all.

KnC: Summer ended Sept 21, delivered mid Oct. Lets say 3 weeks late.HashFast: "Ships Oct 20-30", still hasn't delivered mid January. Lets say 3 months late and counting."Hashfast is less late than KnC is." Wow. No wonder BFL is always late. You don't understand the difference between days, weeks, and months!

Impressive results!Still on track to deliver in October, November, December, January? Bitmains are well under $9/gh. I think these need a 30% price drop now. Bitfury and Bitmain are in-stock and delivering very fast.
Yup, from October to January is already 3 months, and they don't have a working chip yet. They'll be much later than 3 months before they ship anything. * Syke goes to register on CampBX... What's this?https://forums.butterflylabs.com/bfl-forum-miscellaneous/5127-knc-will-not-time-so-josh-correct-yah-right-5.html#post60204Oh, look, another "two weeks" estimate. There's a plethora of them out there. Q1 was never a possibility. Ever. No, he doesn't. The huge problem with Hashfast is they are sending forced USD refund checks to customers who did not request a refund, but they were promised BTC refunds. It is wrong is so many ways. Keep dreaming. Did they say, "Honest Abe!"? There are several vendors that are selling from stock, Bitfury and Bitmain to name two good ones. Yeah, why? Overheated? Chip fried? Hashing failed? Caps blew?For a device that needs to run 24/7/365, the fact that they only had it running for mere minutes on Eligius is highly troubling. LOL. "March batch". ROFLMAO. No order placed with BFL now is going to be delivered in March. It's very strange that no one has been able to product the working stats page from Eligius. This is a strong indication that there are problems and they are unable to leave the unit running. And in the interest of full disclosure for the newbies, we need to point at that Inaba is actually a senior level executive at BFL that posts under a pseudonym rather than his official Bitcointalk account so that he can try to avoid linking his vitriol with the official company name and continue to shill for them. BFL is the same company that is chronically late with all their product releases. Let's see, $9/GH for something delivered several months from now, or $10/GH (Bitmain) delivered next week. I don't like calling people names, but you'd have to be a blooming idiot to order from BFL! Bitmain just dropped their prices to 2.2 BTC for 180 GH/s. Dave, don't let them get away with all the orders. Time to drop the prices again! Yes, KnC was a several days late, but delivered extra hashrate. How much extra hashrate are Monarchs going to have that are will be several months late? Anyone got a link to the mining stats? I can't figure it out from the screenshot. LOL. Good one.Well, since they're still a long ways from shipping any Monarchs, the 7 month delay is still quite possible. Your attempts at avoiding the "late" issue are pathetic. BFL is months late. Again. And again. And again. Let's be completely naive and ignore the past and just look at the numbers.BFL, 230 GH/s for $4255 = $18.5/ghpsMBP, 200 GH/s for $3200 = $16/ghpsWhy would anyone ever choose BFL????????????????? No, it's not. You're trying to compare overclocked incomplete Bitfury systems with stock clocked complete Antminer systems. That is not a valid comparison.
Do not expect more than 400. The systems are quite stable, but there is a lot of variance in each card's performance. gmaxwell is right. Bitfury systems regularly pull .9 at the wall for complete systems. And that's a 55nm chip!!! That was another, what, 26% jump? Get used to it. It's not going to stop any time soon.Remember back 3 months ago, how you said the hashrate was "about to level out"? ROFLMAO! You were sooooo wrong. 2.4 BTC is an ok price, but are any more actually available at that price? Quoting with the hopes of this coming true. I dropped by the HashFast booth at CES today. No hardware. Not even anyone staffing the booth. Did they even bother to show up? You think their hands are full "building" miners? LOL. "Building" consists of plugging completed boards into a PC case, of which there are a grand total of 2 confirmed builds in the past few months. My grandmother could "build" faster than that between shuffleboard sessions while her arthritis is acting up. Says the guy spending $9,000 a week advertising here! That's half a million dollars a year on an "irrelevant" forum. I agree. Nice clean front-to-back airflow, no wasted space hampering air flow. Best design I've seen. So roughly 800 watts per TH/s total system power. I'd much rather have 2x 800 watt boxes/power supplies than a single 1600 watt box/power supply. $300 sounds reasonable this week. How bout it Dave? Let them collect dust in the warehouse or sell them for $300? Their value sinks every day they sit unsold. Oh, they have plenty of money for sure. They're just not going to give any of it back. Exactly. 2013 was all about getting the gear up and running as fast as possible to maximize return in the first 3 months. 2014 will be about the same. Eventually, maybe 2015, miners will need to care about long lasting hardware.  Excellent. Which states are you incorporated in? You say you're located in NY, yet the state of NY has no record of "Vortech Labs Inc."http://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/bus_entity_search.html Say goodbye to full BTC refunds. Far from aggressive.The *only* manufacturer shipping at a reasonable price right now is BitMain. It would be good if KNC would get back in production to provide some competition. Oh, someone's getting quite defensive. There must be some truth to the accusations. At 350w, 4 units fit on a 15 amp circuit.At 450w, only 3 units fit on the same circuit.It is quite possible that increased power requirements would affect people. That's impressive. Shipped at the worst possible day. Too late to earn ROI, too early for refunds.
Are you referring to BFL's Monarch?http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/ +1http://www.broadfinancial.com/bitcoin https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=383486.0200 GH/s for 3.15 btc (~$2250) All we're asking for is that their product specs and shipping dates be somewhat accurate. As it is now, BFL's specs and dates are pure lies. Nah, that's double the price of a Bitmain miner. Yeah baby! Guaranteed shipping today or tomorrow! WIN! Then consider the true supply.All miners throughout the entire world generate about 100k coins per month. Trading volume on all exchanges is about 100 times that. The drop from 25 coins to 12.5 coins will be a non-event. Don't bother. At the current prices, there's no use buying these. April News: PCB redesign nearing completion. Shipping begins in two weeks. The catch is the KYC requirements:http://www.etoro.com/en/customer-service/withdraw-faq/Trading fees are excessive:http://www.etoro.com/en/customer-service/fees/ All-in scares me. I prefer a balanced 50/50 approach. I invest in equal quantities of USD and BTC. My point is stock companies can be bought. All shares may not be present on an exchange, but they are available for purchase. Therefore, calculating their market cap (# of shares * price) makes sense.Calculating bitcoin's market cap as "# of shares * price" is inaccurate because it is literally impossible to buy all of bitcoin. So many of the mined bitcoins simply are not available for purchase, at any price. They may as well not exist. Don't use them to calculate a "market cap". All we can really work with is market depth. By looking at market depth, we can see that it would not take a very large investment to make bitcoin's price skyrocket to the moon. No, public companies are purchased all the time, typically for a price not much more than their market cap.For example, Dell was public for 25 years, before it was bought out just a couple months ago. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell#2013_buyoutBitcoin cannot be liquidated by a leveraged buyout. Bitcoin is not a stock. Only place to get the ants is sushi's groupbuys: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=383486.0. Stop thinking of "market cap" as the total number of bitcoins times the current price. Bitcoin isn't a stock. Take MtGox for instance. It would only take a purchase of about $20 million to take the price to $2000. That's a far smaller number than $12 billion! No, everybody doesn't. My bitcoin wallet will never go to 0. Looks like people didn't like the fiat they got for Christmas, and are now dumping it for bitcoins. Was the exwork thing in the original TOS, or the ninja-edited one? You're not the only one.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax#Existing_net_wealth.2Fworth_taxes Right. Think of it from another angle. What if those 25 million millionaires decide to store even a small portion of their investments in Bitcoin? What would that do to the price?
Remember, it's "delivery by Dec 31". We've already passed the point of possible delivery for a lot of people, i.e. International customers. Two weeks after BFL does. 3 reasons.1. $2. $$3. $$$ And since you haven't returned it for RMA, you're what Josh considers "a happy customer". BFL has *a lot* of "happy customers". Let's see you put your money where your mouth is:$5700 per week on advertising on this forum. Clearly you don't really believe Bitcointalk is irrelevant, or you wouldn't be dumping that kind of money into it. They're still selling product based on Nov/Dec for shipping.http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/ Classic. When you're losing the argument, resort to insults. If Hari Seldon were around, he could do it! Summer ends Sept 21. They shipped about 5 weeks later. So no, they were not "months" late. And clearly someone who was 6 months late shouldn't be criticizing others. One more day gone. The wall is getting full. Here's another 1000 btc bet Inaba didn't pay:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=92268.msg1217403#msg1217403 You're joking, right?Let's see what an inside expert has to say:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=92268.msg1454547#msg1454547It's pure luck they don't all melt down. I wouldn't count on Neptunes being 5 TH/s. Cooling that beast would be crazy.I wouldn't count on HashFast not shipping. And Cointerra not shipping. And Black Arrow not shipping. And BitMine not shipping. And BFL not ship...wait, you can count on BFL not shipping. Now that she has hers, it's time for you to get yours. Make it two months, and you got a deal. Seriously? You're just going to pretend the "Saturday shipping" quote was never said? Let me refresh your memory again. Did you even look at the calc that I posted? It uses a decreasing exponential, specifically becau like you said, it will get harder to make the same impact. I'd love to increase my wallet size from mining. But I'm sorry, the hardware being offered today just isn't going to do that. How about this one?What's John got to say now? A calculator is only as good as its inputs. 4 months ago I said we could break 1B difficulty by the end of the year. We did it in mid-December. Difficulty is going to be very very high by the time Neptunes are delivered. You can count on that. So this is him?He's got plenty of time to make promises, on the forums, but when it comes to answering for those promises, he's "too busy"? Gotcha.
At 20% (and lower) per adjustment, here's a conservative estimate:http://btcinvest.net/en/bitcoin-mining-profit-calculator.php?diff=1180923195.258&dcosts=13000&diff_mincrease=20&blpbtc=25&dhsmhs=3000000&diff_mincreasedecrease=2&btcusd=600&dpowcon=2400&btcusd_mincrease=2&pcost=0.13&calcweeks=50&dleadtime=16&action=calcNeptunes are going to be too late to make a decent payout. Bitfury is available now: https://megabigpower.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=69Bitmain is currently sold out, but likely to have a new batch very soon: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=330665.0 By the time Neptunes are delivered, difficulty is going to be at least 10x higher than it is now. That means when you actually start mining, you'll only mine .1 btc per day, and it'll only go down from there. It's going to take quite some time to earn back those 11 btc. Just look in your direction and you go flying across the court. Well played flop, iCEBREAKER!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flop_%28basketball%29 How much is HashFast paying you to troll competitors' threads? "Will be." See that? There's nothing "anticipated" about it. It is a promise. I failed promise. 30% difficulty increase now in effect. I suggest the prices drop 30%. Ack! You should really come up with another excuse. Your trading volume is nearly non-existent. Just in case anyone forgets: That's what you don't understand. All those coins you don't see on the exchange? They aren't available because the price is still too low. *That* is what's propping the price up. Not the .8% you do see. It's the 99% you don't see. Ew, Avalon chips. Mega power hungry. Not likely to RoI before you shut them down from costing more to run than they make. So, how did Saturday go? One single customer came forward and showed a 192 GH/s machine hasing at only 120 GH/s. Not all that impressive. Why does your PayPal account use the same email address? Help me understand what product you are selling.80 GH/s miner (2 boards @ 40 GH/s)128 GH/s miner (3 boards @ 42.7 GH/s)You've also sold a 192 GH/s miner. 192 is 1.5 times the performance of 128. That would require 4.5 boards. How do you do that??? You must be really worried about HF to keep trolling everyone else's threads. Have you found out they really aren't shipping on Saturday? Marto74 has nothing to do with this. AMT is selling a 192 GH/s miner that will never hash at 192 GH/s. That is pure FRAUD. Tis the season. WallGuy, come back! Wall of DOOOOOOOM!!!1!1
It's ridiculous that with the current banking system, it's faster to physically transport money by hand than to wire it overseas. What makes you think getting money into China is hard? That is what China does. They run huge trade surpluses. Just with the US it's like 300 B USD every year. Where are you going to put the 4th board? From the pics you posted, there doesn't appear to be any drive bays.So you'll get between 160 and 180 GH/s out of 4 boards. That's still not the 192 GH/s you paid for. Ok, back on track. Since Goat made Lambo the official car of bitcoin, I'm signing up for a Urus: Must buy moar! Let's have one more dip into the 500's first, so I can grab one more batch of cheap coins. A great big steep exponential curve is what Bitcoinorama calls, "plateauing". LOL. That will change. The chips are going down to $5/chip. Is that at 12 volts, so 180 watts peak output? A bull logo? I guess that makes Lambo the official car of Bitcoin. Lambos for everyone! https://www.kncminer.com/categories/minersIt would be very bad if they started refusing refunds at this time. So far I've seen one report of a 192 GH/s machine being delivered and running at only 120 GH/s. Any other "success" stories? It's a real shame these are overpriced. They're great systems. But prices need to go down over time, not up. Never ever calculate a shipping date as arriving early. The only thing KnC will deliver in March are more Jupiters. Even June is optimistic for Neptunes. And that's your failure. The difficulty isn't going to cap at 2.75B. It's going far beyond that before even a single Neptune ever turns on. I'll offer 12 btc right now for your Neptune order. You can use this one: I just burnt a copy of the blockchain to a DVD. We're now safe from any EM pulses. Did you ever get your 192 GH/s machine to run a little faster than 120 GH/s? Ok, we've been stable for 20 minutes. Time to go all honey badger again.
No, no, no. Don't go back up. I need more coins! Panic sell, we're down to where we were a month ago! Pretty close in price to the Bitmain units, so that's reasonable. Those coins can be yours...for the right price. It's a bad week to be buying hardware with bitcoin prices down 30%. On the other hand, it's a great time to buy bitcoins! Bitcoin is a fast global distributed network. If you attempted to synchronize every miner on every block throughout the entire world, transaction processing would come to a standstill.Besides, nothing funny is going on. Valid transactions are being included in blocks. End of story. Can't you step it up an order of magnitude? I need some coins in the lower 600's. It's good to see Ciara putting their expertise to good use. Unboxing ATX power supplies and putting them into cases can be *really* tricky! I sure hope their technicians were fully trained and certified in the proper use of a #2 screwdriver. This isn't hardware pre-ordered by customers. They don't owe it to anyone. They took the risk funding the production themselves. They're more than welcome to sell it at whatever price they feel like. Obviously the price is too high, or they would fly off the shelves. It's a good product. It's a shame it's not going to new homes. But hey, that's keeps the difficulty from skyrocketing, so that's fine by me. Samples. You call that "in bulk"? Doesn't matter if they started 10 years ago. A huge limitation to actually meeting such a date is TSMC's ability to deliver. They haven't yet ramped up 20nm production! TSMC has only taped-out a handful of 20nm designs so far. TSMC production is going to be very limited in Q1. If TSMC does get in a crunch, who are they going to deliver wafers to first, Apple or KnC? Latest word was 5 days ago with "Running two of the four die in the chip." Any chance of seeing all 4 dies working this week? Fees do not create or destroy coins. They are simply transfers made from the sender to the miner. It's so nice to be trading without goxlag! Exactly. KnC did good on the Jupiters, etc. But they're stepping into fraud territory by implying a Q1 ship date for Neptune when there's simply no chance of that happening. Highly unlikely. We won't see the top till electricity costs become a significant factor in daily expenses. That's maybe 100x to 1000x higher than we are now. It's going to take more than 3 months to get there. It means the PSU should be fine (assuming it is a single 12v rail PSU). You're not near the overall wattage limit, but there might be other issues. The best way is simply to test it. Try each miner out by itself on the PSU. One flaw is your estimates of blockchain growth. The blockchain cannot grow exponentially like that. It can only grow 1 TB every 20 years! No. Don't confuse AC with DC. 1140w AC input @ 90% efficiency = 1026w DC output. Well under the 1200w rated output.
My mistake. Credit cards are available, but only for the 2 smallest miners. What are you guys talking about!. Haven't they already delivered? You can see it right on their product page.http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/Since that's what they're telling all their new customers, it must be true. No they don't. Uh oh. He said they won't ship in December. That must mean January shipping! Yup, and when CoinTerra is 2 months late, then they'll get the same treatment. Notice how you deleted the quote that proves you wrong? I'll add it again. It's only 6 words. I know a couple of them have a lot of letters, but try reading it again. Here it is: HashFast is late because they promised October and failed.They didn't ship in October. They didn't ship in November. December is half over and they have yet to ship. An API is just an interface. What new data is provided by the API that wasn't available in the past? Josh has zero credibility, so it's quite possible they have not taped-out. Message verified. Good one. Buy some gift cards.www.gyft.com Is HashFast shipping today? No? HashFast is right on track to be "2 months late."I see you've learned the fake "earliest possible ship date" terminology. Nice post-sale invention, but has no basis in reality.No, the actual deadline is October. Why bet on market movement against someone who can move the market? Is that just the power consumption at die level? If so, complete system power consumption is going to be significantly higher. That's gotta be one really big power supply! I wonder if all 400 amps are on a single +12V rail. I talked with a rep at Fidelity. He says they're still reviewing BIT. In any case, this is a big step that they're even considering it. Which is a very good thing for some people. With Fidelity owning $1.7 trillion in assets, you don't have to worry about them getting "hacked" and losing your coins. Nice looking setup. Allow me to show you the real quote:There is no way to "paraphrase" "will be" to "earliest possible". Your "paraphrase" is an all out lie. That's a nice term you made up, but that was never HashFast's claim.
Bitmain is selling 200 GH/s for 4.25 BTC, so 5.75 is a decent price for a Saturn. Nobody reads the forums. You have to go by the product page: Bitmain, 200 GH/s, $4000, 400 watts, already in stock and available for immediately delivery.BFL, 250 GH/s, $12000, 1200+ watts, might be delivered next month.I think the choice is quite clear. KnC is just at the extreme. Every other manufacturer is offering lower power units that still run fine in the home. Here's some very important advice. Ppost some photos and videos of these "samples" actually hashing. That would go a very long way to establishing your project as real. PayPal already handles multiple currencies, including exchanging between them. Bitcoin could easily be just another currency for them. Aw, come on. Can't they put a couple 6-pin pcie power sockets in place of the terminals? Seriously? You think some cross-platform virus is going to take out every miner in the world? Do giant asteroids colliding with earth worry you too? A 30% difficulty adjustment increase is a breather? Someone pump the exchange rate to over $1200 so that purchasing these makes sense at the new bulk rate. "market cap" doesn't really exist. Not all coins in existence are available on the market. If sellers stop selling at less than $10k then the price will rise to $10k. This could happen with no additional money in the market. No, that record belongs to ASICMiner. You don't know that. Wallets can contain any number of keys, and you would have no way of knowing how many coins are in it. Let me know when you take the horrible colors out of it. Until then, /ignore. Yup. Now that all the R&D is done, they can make really cheap miners and keep them in their hosting center for massive profits. I didn't think the v1 boards were in stock. Fail again. How many customers does ASICMiner have? Argh! That'll teach me to go watch a friday night movie without putting in a nice low bid first. Nicely played. Woot, cancelled my fiat withdraw and bought back in at $832.
Argh. Already withdrew all my fiat. Not going to be able to get any more cheap coins for a while. It's even worse than that. These boards won't arrive until the next difficulty adjustment, somewhere north of 850M, roughly a 6x increase. These boards are half as profitable. After. I learned a very hard, painful lesson.Are you interested in taking me up on my guaranteed 50% fiat profit offer? I fully support Punin and any other manufacturer setting their prices as high as they want for any reason. I'll continue to purchase the best miners, which right now are the AntMiners. My Bitfury kits will remain half full.But I do take issue with false claims like "made you ROI a long time ago". He could not be more wrong. It's not his fault, but it is a fact. He shouldn't distort the facts. I was correcting his claim that I made a ton of money off it. I didn't, I lost of ton of money. If you think that's true, then I have an investment for you.Send me 100 BTC. When the exchange rate doubles, I'll give you 75 BTC. You have a guaranteed 50% profit in fiat. Interested? No? Why not? No, I paid in bitcoins for a device that mines bitcoins. I did not pay in Euros, Dollars, Tulips, or any other form of currency. My ROI, in bitcoins, is a massive loss. I spent 246.79 btc on an Aug rig. You're insane if you think I've mined that much since then. But that's the thing. I want to buy Bitfury boards because they've done good in the past. But I'm not going to overspend. I hate to buy something else, but I will if they chose to overcharge. They're saying Q1/Q2 delivery. That means end of Q2 delivery at best. Recalculate with a June delivery date. Here's a secret.<whisper>People don't have to buy a full bitcoin.</whisper> Because once it is received to an encrypted wallet, *no one* can take it without the password. You cannot get any safer than that. If you cannot keep a password secure, then you have no business being in the money management position at a business. You can't fault bitcoin for *your* failures. The network is 6000 TH/s. That's roughly the size of 11,000 Jupiters. KnC has shipped 8,000 Jupiters? We could get the FBI to sponsor the party! Huh? Accepting BTC is 100% safe, unlike every other payment method. Go start your own altcoin. There is none of that nonsense in bitcoin. Quote of the day. I don't care what Greenspan actually thinks about bitcoin, but the fact that he has even the vaguest idea what it is, means we are winning! XBT is the almost-official designation for bitcoin. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217. In the US, if you are in the two lowest tax brackets, long-term capital gains are taxed at 0%. That's how you legally avoid paying taxes on your bitcoin cash-outs.
Enormously flawed reasoning in that paper. Confirmations are confirmations. Read Satoshi's whitepaper. There is no time component to confirmation security. The paper incorrectly compares 6 bitcoin confirmations to 24 litecoin confirmations. An entirely invalid comparison. The blockchain can grow up to 1 MB every 10 min. That will take roughly 20 years to reach a single 1 TB. 1 TB isn't that large now, imagine how tiny 1 TB will be in 20 years. With an option to change it back. Nicely done. If your wallet gets too full, the coins start spilling out on the ground, and are lost. Unless he uses a coin mixer first. As is the case for all early miners. Solo mined blocks go to unique addresses. You cannot tell that they are going to the same person or wallet. I gave my old man 5 bitcents for his birthday, worth about $50. Even in his old age he understood .05 btc just fine.Now when .01 btc reaches $10,000 then we might have a problem. I'm ok with it levelling off there. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=299468.02 months after 9/22 would be 11/22. Let's look at the shipping update from 11/22.https://forums.butterflylabs.com/blogs/bfl_jody/379-friday-november-22-2013-shipping-update.html3 out of 4 lines failed to deliver in the 2 month time period. To me it looks like flat periods at the x10 lines for a few months, then run up to the next x10. Flat at .1, 1, 10, 100, and now flat at 1k. Let it settle for a month or two around 1k, then it'll jump up to the next, at 10k. So now instead of "Rather than to only cater for people who have managed to trade or mine the appropriate amount of coins already" it is "To cater only to people who are already our customers." Intersting business model. Seems to be working! You're such a bear. Of course it'll go up forever. I predict by the end of this century then entire world economy will be run on a single bitcoin. https://www.kncminer.com/pages/paymentWhy did they stop accepting PayPal/CC? Having a payment method with some consumer protection was nice while it lasted. Antminer is a low-risk/low-reward bet. Neptune is a high-risk/high-reward bet. Do you really not understand the difference between a miner delivered *this* week, and one that might be delivered in 6 months? Dude, when it crashes from $1220 to $1200 I buy. Of course I'd buy if it went from $2000 to $1000! No, nothing is wrong. They have always been on schedule to deliver at the end of the year as witnessed by their 12/31 refund date. Any previous lies about shipping before that were simply to snag more customers. It worked perfectly. Shipping promises are only promises as long as the date hasn't passed. Then the shipping promise changes retroactively into simply a dream. Note the date on that quote. That sure doesn't sound like an earliest possible ship date. That quote says just the opposite. "Nearly complete", "remaining items fairly fixed", "we're confident". Wrong, wrong, wrong.Fact is, they are late. Months late. LOL. My CPU hashes faster than that brick. They're trying to start shipping late Feb, so I would expect a March delivery, but only if they can tape-out soon.
The current delay in getting USD out is a 5% fee and roughly 4 weeks. This is a special manual transfer. You must contact support at Gox for them to handle it. As more and more people request this, the delay is likely increasing. Not a chance. Bitcoin has its faults, but Litecoin doesn't improve on them in any significant way.1. Energy costs. If anything, Litecoin's scrypt uses far more energy.2. Scalable. Litecoin has faster blocks, thus greater overhead and less scalable.3. Security. Scrypt is less widely used and analysed, thus SHA is likely more secure.4. Anonymous. Litecoin's blockchain is just as susceptable to tracking.5. Microtransactions. Litecoins tx are just as heavy.6. Fast confirms. There's a need for 2 second confirmations, not 2.5 min. Litecoin isn't fast enough to be different.etc.Someday another cryptocurrency will play a key in complementing Bitcoin's faults, but it's not going to be Litecoin. Yes they are.Daily income @ 180 GH/s = $145Daily power @ .30/kwh = $3Power consumption = 2%. Even if difficulty doubles every month for the next 6 months, these are still profitable. Lesson of the day: People in high power cost areas should not be miners. Auction started, then completed and product shipped within hours. Well done Bitmain! There's a lot of other vendors that could learn from you. Don't be stupid. Nobody cares about seeing a rendered image that might be turned into a PCB someday. Everyone is asking for a "photograph" of an actual PCB that exists in the real world, since they have to exist for HashFast to meet any of their promised delivery dates. It's looking more and more like they lied about delivery dates. Exactly. 20nm process is still experimental. Do not delay a real 28nm product for it, at all. Yes, BFL will deliver, as usual, extremely late. That's what you can count on. Me too, which is why I compared BFL to BA, because BA has delivered, and quite successfully on time, unlike BFL. Let's take a lookMonarch: $3510 for 600 GH/s due in Feb.BA: $4799 for 2000 GH/s due in Feb.Why would you waste your money like that? Anyone can be 1337. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet 2 @ 4.5 Yes and yes. This is a picture.And this is a picture.This is not a picture.See the difference? Yes, please send all your money to BFL. That way the difficulty won't go up, and I'll mine more bitcoins for myself. I LOVE BFL! Sure they did. The Jala went from $149 to $249, etc. Your order is immediately delivered to Josh's personal farm for a couple months. After it has mined enough, Josh will forward the useless hardware to you. Take a look at that chart. Couple hours of profit, several months worth of losses. Not yet. They do need to tape out asap if they want to hit a Feb date. Yup, litecoin is actually less scalable. More blocks means more overhead.An altcoin that can handle fast microtransactions will come about sooner or later. More profitable than GPU mining. Not ASIC mining!
This is the calm before the storm. Enjoy it while you can. Did you mean 25% per adjustment? You said "25% difficulty increase per month". 25% per adjustment might be just fine. 25% per month is not. Oh my. I couldn't bear to watch the whole thing after he said "Bitcoin maintains a fraud-free market". Yeah, but now's a great time to order a new miner. When's the next batch, Dave??? Trading fees really eat into your profits when taking advantage of small swings, so you gotta wait for the bigger swings. I sold at 1035 and rebought at 930. Btcchina's no-fee trading sure looks attractive. 1 billion by end of year, 2 billion by end of Feb. There's no way they'll ship by then. Transaction fee will not guarantee a quick confirmation. I just received my 5%-fee wire that was requested 4 weeks ago. At this rate the MPP boards will ship before the actual miners! "Immediate" is a misleading term when dealing with the likes of BFL. Their latest shipping update was "Jalapenos 5 gh/s: June 7, 2013". They still have 5 months backlogged orders for those. If you order today, it will not ship immediately. They are lying, again. Difficulty won't keep doubling for more than a few more months. It'll level off eventually, and these should reach break even in 6-12 months. Excellent release. Good to see progress. Decent package size (25x25mm). Do you have an estimated die size? 1 die per package? Wow, that's so under-estimating the coming hashrate. The last time we had a slow month like that was nearly a year ago before ASICs shipped. It's going to be another year from now before we see a slow month like that. Yo, adamstgBit, time for a new poll! Come on 800s! I have a bunch of buys queued up. Long term capital gains (US) can be at 0% for a lot of people. So they shipped 4 months worth of product in 1 day. That means they've had virtually no sales for the past 4 months! What real-world results of 20nm silicon are they basing their minimum values on? Is it soon yet? Posting a video isn't very hard. 100% wrong. Holding tighter than ever.
http://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/technology/20nm.htm I think it's possible in the long run. Bitcoin isn't everything to everyone. For instance, bitcoin is currently poorly suited to microtransactions and fast confirmations. It may not be possible to add that to bitcoin. Eventually a micro-transaction fast altcoin may gain significant traction. This looks overpriced. But making 20nm wafers isn't "simple". Even if KnC does everything right, there's a very good chance TSMC will be delayed in getting the wafers made.Is ORSoC doing the design again? That was with a mature 28nm process that everyone uses. 20nm is a whole new story. TSMC is going to have their hands full making 20nm work for the big boys (Apple, Qualcomm, etc). Well they sure as hell aren't shipping in Q1. No, what's unreasonable is being told you can't drive your new supercharged Cadillac XLR in weather warmer than 72F. Did they just say "warranty void if ambient temp goes over 22c"? Not all nodes are created equal. It doesn't matter if you reach 50% of the miners, if those 50% only have 1% of the hashrate.  How do you keep the passwords safe and secure? Sounds like a fun game to play. I'll start it off. Then you're far better off simply buying BTC instead of a risky miner purchase. You're almost guaranteed to make a better return. No plan is foolproof. Total loss through a major fire is a very small possibility. I'll have to check my property insurance for fire coverage. Small daily-spending wallet: on my Android phone.Big cold-storage wallet: printed, laminated, in a ziplock baggie, in a Pelican waterproof case, inside my fireproof safe.What I want to do is 3d print my private key qr-code and store that in a safe. I'll second that. Well, until Amazon takes bitcoins directly, for now at least you can get Amazon gift cards. http://www.gyft.com/merchants/amazon-com/ Just as soon as my Bitstamp account is verified. I think they're getting backlogged with a ton of new customers. Since it'll be in Germany, and bitcoin will bear nearing gold parity, how about some fine german heavy metal?Accept: 'One day the tortured will stand up and kick some ass!' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_3TlrZLpQ0Rammstein: 'One size fits all' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX7ur4Ey5X4 No, an early miner (person A) transferred them to person B, who transferred them to person C, who transferred them to person D, who bought some weed. No one knows who A, B, C, and D are, so all we can say is "Shocking News: Someone bought some weed!!!!1!1!" tl;dr There is a short path (4 steps) between an early miner and Silk Road, meaning it could be anyone. Playing 6 degrees of bitcoins is a lot of fun, but proves nothing.
Can you explain what you mean by "no delay"?Nov 10th:http://web.archive.org/web/20131110003305/https://www.kncminer.com/categories/miners More than 22k coins change hands just on MtGox alone. Add all the exchanges together and you'll see that even if all new coins were sold every day, they are but a few percentage points of the trading market. This patch rejects perfectly valid transactions. This is a very bad patch. As BFL customers have found, when you go past the 45 day Paypal time limit it becomes very hard to get your money back. When Paypal finds out, they will shut down Kotak's account. Your only hope is to use a credit card through Paypal. Then you might have enough time. That's not how it was explained.Read that again. "one reuse per block." The second reuse will be delayed no matter the size of the first block. Delaying transactions is a bad implementation. Since Luke-jr doesn't want to have an actual debate in his thread, I've started a new non-censored thread so a real debate can happen.Show me their personal identity. If you cannot provide their personal identity, they are anonymous.Bitcoin doesn't need slower transaction confirmations. Bitcoin clients need to make unique address use easier. Ok, who is this person:https://blockchain.info/address/1Dc7NUeohUaujaqzcUg9XQ7YLzSGjn1FRG Slowing down transactions is not the right way of accomplishing the intented purpose. The right way is to make unique addresses easier to use. Why would you even consider it? You pay up front, with no guarantee when it will actually start hashing. It's a big waste of your money! Argh! He just won't go away! Gox is a USD black hole. USD can't get out. The problem started 6 months ago, and it's just getting worse. Thermal testing with mockups at the end of November? Shouldn't that have been done well over a month ago? What if Avalon is behind this? Get rid of their bad reputation by hiding behind a new name? Who says bitcoin is competing with credit card companies? They both serve very different purposes. Profitability is what matters.1. USB2. modular3. free4. any5. ATX I'm not so sure. The first small batch is for China. I haven't heard them say a big batch is ready. I did read this:I'm afraid the price listed for a 2-month delivery date is way too high. Tomorrow they are supposed to have ACH transfers working. That should be pretty quick. Wow, could you stoop any lower? So close! My transfer to the exchange was at 5 confirmations. I love rollercoasters.
 These are the cheap bitcoins. Safe bet? No. My bet is to make a point. They keep lying about shipping dates. Let me get this straight. A GE engineer claimed the problem wasn't caused by GE hardware, but by some other company's product? Do you see why people would question the results of this "test"? How about you fly in a Corsair engineer and get his opinion? You wait until they're almost done with the backlog, then you offer a very lenient date. Josh has already stated they'll be finished 10 days before that date. Wow, such a risky bet for you!Where was your bet when they promised clearing pre-orders in Aug?Where was your bet when they promised clearing pre-orders in Sep?Where was your bet when they promised clearing pre-orders in Oct?I'll offer you a better bet.http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/They're still advertising a November shipping date. I'll bet you 10 BTC they don't ship a Monarch in November. https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=link%3Aadvancedminers.com&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8Not a lot of sites linking to them. I have 1 BTC that I will sell for $1,000,000 right this minute. PM me. Only if you have a Japanese bank account. So that's what's driving this rally!https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=321800.0 Right, so don't go all-or-nothing. Buy some now, and if it does go down buy more. If it goes up, you'll be glad you at least have some. Very good advice. Bitcoin is where Berkshire Hathaway was at in 1980. Look at it now. A moderate Bitcoin investment now could be astronomical in 30 years. Thank you! Whoever bought your coins will be very happy in a few months. I hope you made a nice profit too. Let's look at what they have said.24 days + a few days for packaging, resulting in early December delivery. Sounds like they might have actually taped-out. In November. 3 months late! Josh has claimed to ship 40k units, so I'd take that to be an upper-bound on what they've actually shipped. Josh just did it again. He predicted they'll clear all orders "in two weeks". Keep an eye on CampBX. It's a small market now, but next week when ACH transfers are supported getting funds in and out should be pretty good. It would make absolutely no difference. Time to grab some cheap $420 coins before China wakes up. Have you seen the self checkout isles? Those are far harder to use than a smartphone bitcoin wallet. The more it goes up, the less likely I am to sell. I don't think I'm alone in that view.
Which statement is true:A) 1 btc < (.5 btc + .5 btc)B) 1 btc = (.5 btc + .5 btc)C) 1 btc > (.5 btc + .5 btc) ROFLMAO. Which is more? A) $1B) $1.00C) $1.0000 That's one auction I would very much like to attend. I wonder what payment methods the FBI accepts. Get the coins then reverse the payment.  LOL. Thanks for the brilliant comedy! Are you a professional comedian IRL? The "I was hacked!" defense for missing coins works every time. Weekly meetups: http://www.meetup.com/Silicon-Valley-Bitcoin-Users/ That's just 420 on one exchange. You need to celebrate when it hits 420 on each and every exchange! KnC and Bitfury are virtually tied. Although neither is taking orders right now. So you're saying it's ok to lie on a press release, because it's not a very significant issue? There's also companies that have web devs that know how to issue a query to the mail carrier's API and retreive the actual cost for the package and have the customer pay the actual cost of shipping. When I bought my house just this year, I needed to pay the downpayment with a cashier's check. Do non-US banks issue them?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashier%27s_check Bitfury has lower power consumption. Regular USD wires are stuck back in June. 5% fee manual withdrawl wires are backlogged a few weeks (and I suspect growing rapidly). If this rally continues, the exchange rate will reach 100,000,000 satoshis per bitcoin! And if they're late you promise to never post a positive post on them? For someone who doesn't really like Bitcoins, he sure does post on them a lot. Is he a closet bitcoiner? Not if your business is loaded with tons of debts! What else would "go out of business" mean? None. BFL never shipped a 1.5 TH/s machine. ^ Cheap coins, get 'em while you can.
It's more like $0.03. You can get by with a 0.0001 btc fee and still have the network relay it to everyone. $ bitcoind verifymessage 14j6jLececs66ZQ8ew6vTFNiEn2NupacWJ IDJMXbBfGRnTZkFrZbGo7cv2ywRes0zFxn9VIKsG2bJlrkJYsUmJp8fGrQbUxJWnYLY8NKwMs0mqEZk U1wsiCuU= "I am 'Loaded' of bitcointalk.org. AMA."truehttp://blockchain.info/address/14j6jLececs66ZQ8ew6vTFNiEn2NupacWJSure looks like he still has them. You're an idiot for even thinking that's possible. Even BFL's overly optimistic estimate (that'll be missed like every other estimate they've ever made) is "hope to have our first units shipped out the door by the end of December." No kidding./ignore +1 Here come the cheap coins. Grab 'em while you can! You have to hand it to BFL's lawyers. They're really good at giving the impression of one thing, while actually saying the opposite. Honest Abe! As is January for Chinese New Year. This is a very bad time of year to try to launch new electronics. No offense, but shipping a couple hundred units a day is amateur. Professional factories can ship thousands upon thousands. So far, it's been just amatuers shipping units. When the real manufacturers start pumping out miners, you're going to cry at the difficulty increases. It's not going to level off anytime soon. Any leveling off you see is just temporary variation. Tons more hashpower is coming online in the following months. A few days of low increase means nothing in the big scheme of things. 6 months from now I'm going to laugh so hard at anyone sayinig it's leveling off now. Yeah, lets take a look at how the difficulty has gone since you said that.10/16 +41%10/26 +46%11/5 +31%Yeah, it sure has "leveled out". Yes, the public blockchain is excellent evidence for when you acquired them. Yeah, so why is House in my window? What was that? Yup. So much money is tied up in delayed preorders. Maybe we'll be lucky and Novement will only be +100% difficulty over October. Yeah, and I could find a bitcoin block with my CPU mining today. Sure, it's possible. Yikes! Where do you live? At least in the US, the tax service isn't sent such private information. At least not until you are audited. The government has no business combing through everyones bank statements without cause. Yeah, but none of those 20nm designs are bitcoin miners. I think $1000 might be too far away. What about a party at a closer milestone, say $420?  I don't see how anyone will break even, even with a 4-module MPP delivery 90 days later.
Since when does the tax service get copies of your bank statements? Two pizzas, actually.  The solution is trivial. 2 hot wallets. All deposits go into one wallet, then when matured, then transfer to the other wallet. All withdrawls come out of the second hot wallet. Problem solved. Anything above 192 GH/s is untested. No need to worry about that. Josh loves to gloat about how they're raking in the dough. How? SR didn't get the addresses of buyers. Only sellers got peoples addresses. The more it goes up, the less I want to sell. BTC 0.92? You're kidding, right? Too rich for my blood. I deal with satoshis. Refusing advanced RMAs is a huge cost to their customers. It does not cost them any extra. I guess the "under-promise, over-deliver" dosn't go very far.  Post a successful court decision and I'll send you a bitcoin donation! Well, I left out having a home paid off. If so, congrats!Thanks for the clarification. You don't have to pay taxes on growth in value for capital assets until you cash them out, right? So go with $0 in wages, cash out $72K in capital gains each year, and leave the rest of the $10M in bitcoins untouched? Then we have a different definition of rich. I consider someone pulling in $70k in salary, with absolutely no debt, to be basic-rich. Add in millions in capital gains at 0% tax rate, and that's mega-rich. Yes, for just 1 year. Then the next 50 years I'll be back down in the bottom tax brackets.A couple making up to $72,500 is in the 15% tax bracket, and without any debt, $72k is a very very nice living. Beyond that you get the 0% long-term capital tax rate. Score! But "rich" people can drop themselves down into the lowest tax brackets. For example, if bitcoins go up high enough, I'll pay off my mortgage, have no other debt, and be able to reduce my regularly needed income to much lower levels and stay down in the bottom tax brackets while living very comfortably. Very smart. I use Google Authenticator on CampBX. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-person-advantage-0-capital-gains-tax-rate-214600255.htmlSo be sure to hold onto those bitcoins for at least a year. I was pretty happy when I was using a 1% cashout every $10 increase, so I made a copy of the spreadsheet and switched it from % increases to fixed $ increases. It's a good looking plan. https://www.kncminer.com/news/news-63WTF? With the network roughly 4 TH/s, 70% would be 2.8 TH/s, or roughly 5000 Jupiters. But they shipped a lot of units slower than Jupiters. So lets say roughly 10,000 units shipped. Is that in line with their shipping announcements?
http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus02-business-guide-mail-and-telephone-order-merchandise-rule About 1. Since when do random ToS trump FTC regulations? Good point. Guess how you get more fiat? Get more BTC! Don't ever invest in something that gives you less BTC! Yes, please! I need to pick up some cheap coins. China is #2 in GDP. There's plenty of money there. Yes! More BTC than you started with is a profit. Less BTC than you started with is a loss. That was back when the difficulty was only 390M.  What account type are you using, EI's Flex IRA? I sure hope so. They have a good product, but the price isn't competitive any more. Creative trolls can be interesting. Just spamming "crash incoming" several times every page is not creative. Shouldn't this be held at a place where you can use your bitcoins to the fullest? Say Amsterdam or Prague? There some interesting analysis that starts at http://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/. The 235 ship has sailed. Don't you also need a self-directed IRA plan somewhere else? Got any potentials lined up for that? Sure, you can mine a block, not publish it, and continue mining. But unless your pool has 51% of the network, the odds are the rest of the network will invalidate the block you are hiding, and then you've just lost a block and have to start over. It does nothing to harm the network, just yourself. And with tomorrow's 40% difficulty increase, the next 50% is going to take more than 47 days assuming no more difficulty increases (which isn't realistic). Your break even point is many months from now, if ever. Bitcoins - not even Gox can dirty them. Are you saying Gox bitcoins are radioactive???
There are a lot of old blocks that were never spent that follow a pattern that identify Satoshi-mined blocks with a pretty good degree of certainty. If even a single satoshi of those blocks is moved, people will notice. Feature size is starting to get muddy. 20nm and 14nm miners might not have the speed and power improvements we've come to expect from node improvements.http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/devices/the-status-of-moores-law-its-complicatedWell designed 28nm chips are going to be the best available for a very long time. Second batch baby jets? Yeah, you're not going to see that delivered any time soon. Say goodbye to ROI. That's if the miner is already delivered, which it isn't. This is what it looks like next month.http://mining.thegenesisblock.com/a/9388e2430d BFL advertised "Tape out August 2013". Didn't happen in Aug. Didn't happen in Sep. Didn't happen in Oct. Now it's Nov. They're already several months late.BFL Monarch: 600 GH/s for $4680 delievered long after Feb.KnC Jupiter: 550 GH/s for $4995 delivered in Nov.Why would anybody waste a single second considering a BFL product? It's a guaranteed loser, no matter how you pay for it. Good point. Max of 2x 600w rigs on a 15 amp circuit, 3x 600w rigs on a 20 amp circuit. Now calculate how much fiat/BTC you would have if you would have simply purchased bitcoins directly instead of pre-ordering a miner that creates bitcoins very slowly. Dwolla won't help you. Contact CampBX and have them undo the withdrawl. 5 days ago. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=202792.msg3406192#msg3406192Quite true. How could you miss them?

There's hundreds more. This is how he typically acts. Why does that surprise you with all the personal attacks he has leashed on his customers here? Oh, look. BFL does not do anything. It is not alive. It is no more intelligent than a rock. The Officers, such as Chief Operating Officer Josh, are the cause of all these problems. Stick it to the fiat buyers. Two buyers paying the same day, one pays in BTC the other in fiat. One gets MPP, the other gets nothing. Ouch! Josh has bragged about shipping over 20k units. They're no where near 100k units shipped. Every BabyJet is 100% identical to every other BabyJet. Mass produced. Refunds must be available at any time. Excellent news!!! Excellent! That's more bitcoins for me! That's a whole lot of hashpower that won't come online anytime soon. So post a pic of the board. It takes far less time to post a pic than it does to write a big long forum post. Avalon, eww.Your real competition is MegaBigPower with 30 GH/s @ 2.5 BTC.
The KnC offer looks pretty good. They've got a working product, and if they can deliver the next batch in November as promised, I think there's a high probability that it'll pay for itself in BTC. Part of that is due to the recently runup of BTC value. Two weeks ago you'd have had to pay too many BTC for a KnC order. It's not their fault, they're just minimizing risk. BFL has utterly destroyed the reputation of bitcoin mining hardware by causing vast amounts of chargeback due to failing to deliver. No, it's a 0% chance. Zero. Nada. Impossible for them to ship it on time. Sorry, you picked the wrong betting site. They have a huge problem with deciding bets the right way. Try http://bitbet.us/. Time to rerun the numbers. New difficulty 391648152. It only took you 6 months to ramp up to the number of units KnC ramped up to in two weeks. WTG!!! Also, those KnC units are faster than your Minirigs. How many Minirigs did you ship in that day? They've been selling by auction at https://tradehill.com/auctions.Available for Oct delivery at https://megabigpower.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=53.Readily available at https://www.btcguild.com//index.php?page=store and other resellers.First it was 20,000 devices. How do you ship 400-1000 a day for 6 months and only ship 20k units? Just be sure to open a non-delivery issue with PayPal before the 45-day window closes and you have nothing to worry about. I hope you paid with a credit card. Wow, an apology! How many BTC is that worth now that you're months late and difficulty is through the roof and the product you are delivering will never break even. You even said it yourself over a year ago...BTW, how's that "August 2013" tapeout coming along. Still going to make that date that you're still advertising on your webpage? Are Block Eruptors mining devices or not? Have they shipped more of them than you? I'd wager they have. You lie. Again. But your numbers ignore the fact that BFL is way overpriced. You can get 1 TH/s for $10k. I like http://www.bitcoinity.org/markets/mtgox/USD. Wow. No kidding. POP. I'd love to pickup another starter kit, but with h-boards already over priced at $500, your asking price is not interesting. Unless they conflict with federal regulations. Your lawyer may not be aware of relevant FTC regulations. Have him read over this: http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus02-business-guide-mail-and-telephone-order-merchandise-rule. Particularly the section on delays. Just think of all the coins you'd have if you had bought bitcoins instead of pre-orders. The only US withdrawls are "manual withdrawls" that incur a 5% withdrawl fee. Ouch. That's another 2-3 difficulty adjustments. http://www.butterflylabs.com/management-view/josh-zerlan-3/
Josh doesn't use the BFL_Josh account. He uses his Inaba account for all his BFL-related activities.Josh is not just "PR". He is a senior-level executive at BFL. Read up on what a COO is. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you Josh. Thank you for missing so many deadlines. All my miners (that I wisely ordered from everyone else but you) are so much more profitable since you can't ship yours. THANKS!!! Keep up the good work. Think you'll finish shipping the old pre-orders by August, September, October? Is it intentionally that the new V1 h-boards are missing components? What happened to daily shipping updates? I need to know how much to cry. Each board pulls about 300 watts over 2 PCIe 6-pin connectors. When one power supply dies, that board will start pulling 300 watts over a single 6-pin connector. How many power supplies cables can safely supply 300 continuous watts over a single 6-pin connector? Yup, keep up the good work people. Their BBB rating is down to a D. You don't want to mix-n-match cables. If you have 2 power supplies feeding to a single board and one power supply dies, the board will try to pull double the load from the other power supply. Bad things happen. Because the Bitfury will be delivered in Oct and the Jupiter will be delivered in Nov. Expect to see the Bitfury price drop in a month to remain competitive. Why should we give these forums more money??? We're running close to 9 blocks per hour, so 50% increase is about right. Next update should break 400M. Actually, it is intentionally deceptive. When they say "network congestion", they are trying to imply that the problem is outside their control, some "congestion" in the real bitcoin network. Nothing could be further from the truth. Their "congestion" is completely inside their own systems.They have tried to use that excuse on me with bitcoin deposits. My transaction had already received more than 23 confirmations on the live bitcoin blockchain and they still tried to blame "network congestion". Well, unfortunately there are a lot of stupid people in the world. I don't usually laugh at other people's misfortune, but I'm really going to laugh at the hugh profit loss of everyone who bought in to the Monarch. We warned them long ago, yet they didn't listen. Their only hope is to try to get a refund ASAP. Monarch: 600 GH/s for $4680 delievered in Feb or later.Jupiter: 550 GH/s for $4995 delivered in Nov.The choice is clear. BFL is far too expensive and risky. They missed their Oct 17th chip delivery date. Since that's part of the critical path, that is going to affect further deadlines down the road. Bitfury and KnC are the only 2 decent, low risk manufacturers. Everyone else is very high risk for any number of reasons. It's highly unlikely that the up to 400% MPP will make a difference. You might get 100%, but that hashrate 3+ months in the future are worth about 1/10th the starting rate. So the MPP is worth a boost of about 10%. Hardly going to make the difference in ROI. With the recent run-up in BTC price, you're no longer at $20 per GH/s. Yes. Available in under two weeks and much much lower wattage: https://megabigpower.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=53 I'm sure he will...in two weeks. Dual power supply sounds familiar. Now where did I see that? Oh, yeah...
Wow, they're still using that "network congestion" excuse as if the problem is outside their control, when it's totally their own problem. With KnC's November batch at $5k for 550 GH/s, there needs to be a significant price drop for the next batch of these. That's what I thought. There are no "other methods". Your "reasoning" is clouded by being a knc-fanboi. The hashrate is not going to "level out" for quite some time. Quoted so I'll have something to laugh at after a couple more crazy adjustments. Which "other methods" allow a US customer to withdraw their USD from MtGox? There are also potential customers that were watching to see how KnC performed. KnC just lost them due to their lying about shipping dates. Compare to say, Bitfury. When Dave first ran into a delay he notified his customers *before* the deadline. This alone went a long way to keeping his customers happy. KnC on the other hand keeps missing deadlines and not communicating. Which is a lot more like BFL and Avalon do business. Not good company to be with. As such I don't trust KnC. They're on the path to becoming the next BFL. All he has to do is sign a message using the private key for 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa. It would be dead wrong. You might as well flip a coin to decide if a wallet is lost or not. It would probably be more accurate than using any sort of analysis you could come up with. And here comes a whopper of a 40% difficulty increase. Now is a very bad time to be late! I'm not talking 180 days. MPP kicks in at the end of 90 days, at which point network difficulty is likely to be quadruple what it is when the miner starts mining. MPP hashrate won't come on line until well after 90 days, which means it is worth a very small fraction of the original hashrate. It is just theater. ROI is not being "protected". MPP is nothing more than a miniscule consolation prize. They need a lot more than little tubes.http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Natural-Water-Based-Lubricant-Gallon/dp/B005MR3IVO Which "other methods" allow a US customer to withdraw their USD from MtGox? Compare KnC first batch with Avalon first batch. There's just no comparison. Avalon-1 was hugely profitable for most customers. KnC-1 will not be hugely profitable for any customers. But the key point is the MPP delivers the goods 3-4 months after the miner. A reasonable assumption will be the 400 GH/s will reach at least 50% output, with the MPP providing 1 board 3-4 months later. Since difficulty is skyrocketing, that 400 GH/s MPP board is actually only worth about 50 GH/s. MPP will not provide positive ROI because it provides the hashrate too late.MPP is nothing more than roi theater. Do you own my bitcoins or do I? What I do with my bitcoins is none of your business. If I want to have them sit untouched in a cold wallet for 40 years until my grandkids are old enough to manage them theirselves, then that's what I'll do and I'll fight you trying to steal them from me till the day I die. A label is fully refundable up until the time the UPS driver scans the package. There is no excuse for not offering full refunds as promised up until the time the package is picked up. Anyone know why the power consumption is so much higher than other BitFury-based miners? 
Can anyone confirm a regular USD withdrawl to the US in the past 4 months (that wasn't using the 5% special fee)? Not necessarily: The difficulty always adjusts at exactly 2016 blocks. If you are estimating 30% difficulty increases, then those 2016 blocks will take about 11 days, not 14. This chip is DOA. There are already better chips available today. Why wait months for an inferior chip from a supplier with a horrible track record? New deadline, "in two weeks".

I have a lot of money invested in my miners. Do you ship new versions of Bitcoin without running them on the live network? Until there is a test suite that verifies the protocol completely, there are all sorts of issues that could crop up on main net that don't show up on test net. Test net is a good starting place, but it doesn't offer everything that main net does. I would not buy a miner that hadn't proven itself mining on the real net. Testnet is not the same.

Bitcoins-in vs. bitcoins-out is the most logical way to evaluate an investment in mining hardware. Kudos to KnC for building the first 28nm Bitcoin ASIC! Well, they did promise to ship in September, and that didn't happen. Let's see how long it takes them to actually ship the orders. Well, if you purchased today:Bitfury, 400 GH/s, $8000, delivered in Oct.KnC, 500 GH/s, $4995, delivered in Nov.It'll be a few months before the energy costs become significant, so they're pretty close in value. The only speed that matters is accepted shares over a period of time to limit the variance.

Oct difficulty is going to go crazy.
No, he's also trying to justify the ROI on them. That's where he's going too far. Don't even try to defend the ROI. It's just not there. These will not break even at the current bid prices unless you have nearly free power.http://mining.thegenesisblock.com/a/cf8f2331e7 Ouch. Only 1% of the die is hashing, and not actually showing a real miner hashing? That's it?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt9zSfinwFA That's going to depend on when Dave actually ships. EU customers are already receiving their kits and mining at 150MM. Huge win for them. Ignore the date. Just pay attention to the starting difficulty. The next two weeks are crucial for ROI. US ROI estimate: http://mining.thegenesisblock.com/a/15281afd05. Not looking good.EU customers are going to get decent ROI due to early delivery. http://mining.thegenesisblock.com/a/333c1299c7 28nm silicon that uses double the energy of a 55nm silicon. I'm not sure you should be bragging about that. Bitfury was delayed a few days, but they announced the delay well in advance of the scheduled ship date. Communication like that makes all the difference. Yet you demand your customers donate to you by not giving 100% refunds. If you can take delivery before the next difficulty adjustment, you have a good chance of ROI. Delivery in a month? No chance of profit.

You mean the "Tape out August 2013" that was due a month ago but doesn't appear to have happened? Now that summer is officially over, are these ready? My miners are already running power/GH of .75 at $.02/kw energy today. I expect to have something significantly better by 2014.If you're mining at 2.1 W/GH and $.10/kw, your days are numbered. The rest of us will leave you behind. 3600 btc/day * 30 days * $130/btc = $14million revenue. So yeah, $3million per month is going to be cake. Pumping out 800 TH/s in Jan is going to be easy. That's only a few thousand chips. 10%? Per month? What a joke.
1 on-time10,000 lateHas BFL set the bar so low that 1 out of 10,000 is good news? I guess so. That "as of Aug 19th" isn't on the webpage. How is a regular customer supposed to know those statements are no long applicable? By leaving deceptive statements on the web page, something that may have been true once before is now simply dishonest.You can thank Josh for being such a great PR person. He just inspires me. Right, Bitfury isn't endgame. It's just the best that's currently available. Better stuff will come along. It's a little early to be celebrating. All they have now is some silicon. It has not been proven to work, yet. It has not hashed a single header. Show it hashing, then celebrate. Proof? How about "Tape out August 2013"? Think that's the truth? How about "That 65nm ASIC chip is now powering the majority of the bitcoin network."? Is that the truth? Those are from their current website. Asicminer is fleecing people with honesty.BFL is fleecing people with dishonesty.Subtle but significant difference. Growth rate is going to continue to skyrocket until the cost of electricity becomes significant.Bitfury, 400 GH/s at 300 watts. Current Difficulty = 112628548 roughly 1 PH/sDaily incomeÂ  = $223Daily electricity at $.10/kwh = $.72Difficulty at roughly 54 PH/sDaily incomeÂ  = $4.13Daily electricity at $.10/kwh = $.72Even at 54 PH/s, electricity costs are only 17% for a lot of miners. That's still a profit of $100/mo, so reasonably prices ASICs will still sell at that difficulty. ASIC prices are going to keep plummeting, and the network is going to blow past 54 PH/s. Easily. With no guarantee of the contract start date, this is a worthless offer. That looks good. How tall is it, 5U? LOL. It's not that your word isn't good enough. It's that BFL's "word" is worthless. Without documented proof they're just lying. Like how they claim to be powering "the majority" of the network. Where is your evidence? BTC was really low. An Aug kit ran roughly 225-250 BTC. They will unlikely break even in BTC. BFL never promises anything. Everything is an "estimate", and every "estimate" is missed. Eventually you come to realize their "estimates" are deliberately optimistic in the hopes of deceiving customers. I'd like to see them try. Good news, but are you now guaranteeing delivery in 20 days?https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/helpcenter/article/?solutionId=39067&topicID=11500005&m=TCI Absolutely. In the long run, miners will locate where low cost electricity is (as long as a good Internet connection is also available). That is still scheduled to be taped out in Aug '13. Honest Abe. Oh look, the Sep 30 backpeddling has begun. That chart needs to be redone.Both of those assumptions are no longer accurate. Yeah, the mistake was BFL thinking they could avoid chargebacks that way.
Too little too late. $900k for 84 TH/s several months from now best-case scenario? Buy 10 reels of Bitfury chips and you'll have them next month doing 80 TH/s. Far easier and more profitable. The end result is the same. Customers get screwed. FTFY. Many reasons. One is BFL is lying to them telling them they cannot receive a refund.Well, the law doesn't care. BFL failed to deliver, and customers are being illegally denied refunds. Why they request a refund is irrelevant. Feel free to read over the regulations.http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus02-business-guide-mail-and-telephone-order-merchandise-ruleNo where does it specify the customers thoughts to be a reason against refunds. Why do you want so badly to be the thought police here? Paypal polices state delivery must be within 20 days of receiving payment. Name one customer that has received their BFL SC unit within the required 20 days.Spoiled food. I don't care why someone buys something. If it isn't delivered as promised, when promised, then that person is well within their rights to request a refund. The law agrees with me. Was he delivered on time? If all you have is second grade math skills you might think ridiculously thin margins are acceptable. We'll be reaching 900 million difficulty in about 6 months, by which point the Jaly will be running not only at a loss, but will not have reached a positive ROI. All BFL products delivered after today will never reach break even.http://mining.thegenesisblock.com/a/c63ab1d40aNow you're talking!!!  Yup, and we're getting another whopping 30% difficulty increase today. Type "cat /run/shm/.stat.log" and post the output. Post the contents of /run/shm/.stat.log to find out what's going on. The new improved Terrahash: Silence That's not quite comparable. Bitfury started taking preorders after showing a working chip, and then delivered working miners a few months later. KNC took preorders months before even having a chip, still doesn't have a chip, yet promises to deliver working miners in under 2 weeks. The odds of KNC delivering on time are rapidly dropping. Reselling a Google Nexus 7 doesn't count. PG. Then just buy some BTC directly. You'll make more profit faster that way. You talk like they've actually delivered something. I'd love KNC to deliver. We need the competition. But until they actually ship something real, their "under promise over deliver" spiel is just marketing BS to lock in pre-order cash to fund their lifestyles just like everyone else. Good luck. The only way to get money out of Gox to USA is with the special 5% fee transfer. They'll raise their prices then offer discount coupons for future orders. I think this is the best idea. The cost of the chips is a sunk cost. Maximize your revenue asap. If you mine with them for a few months, you might generate .5 BTC. Sell them immediately for 1 BTC and you'll generate far more revenue. Then buy the new chips at the new lower price and you'll have a profitable product. They seem to be stuck back at early June withdrawl requests.
Ok, well surely you saw a team working on the Monarch. What did that look like? With the tape-out in Aug '13 they must have some cool stuff going on. Ok, did you see their 400+ units shipped per day? That's fine, with or without chips. Where is the test report? Sure there was. Josh said they sent it to the test lab and was just waiting on the report. Did you get to see the infamous FCC test report of the Jalapeno from last November? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndromeIt's sad. They're throwing away so much money. I feel so sorry for them.BFL: 500 GH/s for $22,484.00 delivered in over 2 months, drawing 2500 wattsBitfury: 400 GH/s for $8,000 delivered in under 2 months, drawing 300 watts If you look at the difficulty adjustments for the past 3 months you'll find the network has grown at an average pace of 25% per adjustment. So we can say that the difficulty is roughly following an exponential curve. Remember way back at the beginning of his year when 100m was unthinkable?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=139375.msg1468796#msg1468796 http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/California I think the 55nm chip has a lot of life left in it. Network difficulty can go up 100x and power costs will still be acceptable. They just need to ramp up production to get costs down. Dave and team did hella-good on most of his first batch, but then again so did Avalon (who later crashed and burned hard). Best of luck finishing batch-1. Do an even better job on batch-2! http://decentralizedhashing.com/bitcoin-mining-equipment-table/The problem is the ship date. Too little. Too late. Too expensive. By the time Monarch ships, difficulty will be too high for it to ROI.Compare it to something actually shipping.BFL: 600 GH/s for $4680 in Feb.Bitfury: 400 GH/s for $8000 in Oct.You're crazy (pun intended) if you think the difficulty is going to grow less than 50% in 4 months! Wow, I'm sure glad Inaba didn't accept my bet. It's now over 4 months later, and they're still shipping Singles from orders placed over a year ago! All you can do is plan for end of Oct. Anything earlier is just a bonus. Don't count on it. You got it backwards. He diverted hardware from his other business to mine for delayed orders.  And what would happen if the heatsinks were mounted on board without any chips? Is the 100 days up? Who has received their bulk chips? 3 weeks? The withdrawl queue is nearly 3 months deep by now. Ok, I think I understand the confusion. The reservation queue isn't a queue at all. It's a reservation pool beause the order you are in the reservation queue doesn't matter one bit. The only thing that matters is order of full payment.
I'm sorry, I can't make sense of what the reservation queue actually does. Answer me this:On Oct 1, customer A places an unpaid reservation order.On Nov 1, customer B places a paid order1 minute later customer A pays for his reservation.What order do the units ship in? Then can you explain these details?What good is a queue that has no guarantee you'll be shipped anything? Are you going to accept any payment methods that have consumer protections?  Sure, dozens of quotes. Here's the latest:http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/When they posted it, it may not have been an intentional lie (I suspect it was, but I can't prove that). But now that we're into the 2nd week of September they leave it there hoping to deceive customers into thinking they're making better progress than they are. So now it's simply a lie.

Of course, test it. But you're looking at maybe 40 watts, tops. It's not going to take much air movement to cool it. A small heat sink and a single fan in front should be plenty. The Bitfury chips don't create a lot of heat. Which is fine, once a sale has been completed. But until the item is shipped, no "sale" has occured. The FTC requires BFL to notify customers of delays and offer full refunds. BFL is violating FTC regulations. Why the customer wants a refund is irrelevent.The difference being BFL units are exactly the same from order to order. These are not custom products. Every Jalapeno is exactly the same as every other one. LOL. Being 10 months late on delivery isn't minutae. It is the core failure of BFL to uphold their side of the "sale".All irrelevent. Exchange rate doesn't matter. Difficulty doesn't matter. BFL failed to perform, and customers are well within their rights to request refunds. It doesn't matter why they want a refund. BFL failed. Curious, you left out the key factor. October Delays. November Delays. December Delays. January Delays. February Delays. March Delays. April Delays. May Delays. June Delays. July Delays. August Delays. September Delays. More than 10 months after first scheduled delivery date and they still haven't finished shipping day 1 orders!

No sale has taken place, since nothing has been delivered.http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus02-business-guide-mail-and-telephone-order-merchandise-ruleExcuses like "your funds are being used" have no basis in regulations. When delays happen (and they happen a lot with BFL), "a statement that, if the customer chooses not to wait, the customer can cancel the order immediately and obtain a full and prompt refund;" and "You must cancel an order and provide a prompt refund when: the customer exercises any option to cancel before you ship the merchandise;" are regulations that BFL must abide by.

Tag the worst vendors as scammers and/or ban them.As long as you permit these crap vendors to run amuk, there is going to be non-stop well-justified hate towards them.Here's another example of BFL failing to meet deadlines and refusing refunds.
7 months later and they're still months from being able to ship your order. I would be on the phone with them demanding a refund every single day, several times a day.  BitFury: 400 GH/s, 300 watts, $8000, shipping in under two months.BFL: 500 GH/s, 2600 watts, $22484, shipping in over two months.I can't imagine why anyone with a BFL minirig doesn't immediately cancel their order. BitFury is better in every way. A non-working board isn't very impressive. Looking forward to the real press announcement that you actually have a deal signed. I wouldn't care either if the farm was up and running. But it isn't. There are lots of 28nm chips in various stages. Which manufacturer they are using will greatly determine their ability to deliver on time. Has the chip taped-out or not? etc. This really hinges on what chip they are using. You want a 200 BTC donation for some FPGA mining code??? Good news. Chargeback protection is needed for customers of these manufacturers.

The only thing that matters is the price today. $274/$128 = 2.14 BTC right now. That's more than 2 BTC.That's funny. ASICMiner is "highway robbery", but BFL is simply "not a good price" even though it costs more and is delivered months later. That means you're simply a troll. That much you can count on. Sorry if I used too many words for you. Let my try one simple question.Is BFL's current offer of 5 GH/s for 2 BTC delivered in "2 or more months" also "highway robbery"? WTF are you talking about? I'm talking about placing an order today. You call 10 GH/s for 4 BTC delivery in maybe a week, "highway robbery". What do you call BFL's 5 GH/s for 2 BTC delivered in "2 or more months"? So you agree BFL prices are highway robbery too. Why would you keep an order with them if you consider it highway robbery? WA state bitcoin miner hosting. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=234975.0 Huh? How is 10 GH/s for 4 BTC delivered immediately highway robbery? That's the same price as a BFL pre-order due to ship in "2 or more months". How about this, quoted from after you placed your order.https://forums.butterflylabs.com/off-topic/3157-true-notice-warning-new-customers-butterfly-labs-inc-bfl.html#post3944406-09-2013It's one thing to have a timeline set in stone. It's another to miss every single estimated delivery date. Sooner or later you'll come to the realization that every comment by Josh is purposefully meant to mislead his customers. Can you prove he doesn't already have the rigs and is mining for himself? Be sure to grab some pictures of the massive wall of 300-400 units shipping that day. Sounds about right. The next few months will easily see 100% difficulty increases.* BitFury (up to 400 GH/s) systems are now shipping. New orders are $8,000 for Oct delivery.* KNC is due to ship soon (up to 400 GH/s). New orders are $7,000 for Oct delivery.* HashFast taped-out (400 GH/s). New order are $5,600 for Oct delivery.BFL on the other hand misses every date promised. $4680 for 600 GH/s due some time after Feb is way too expensive. If you need btc to go to 250 to make a profit, then you'll make more money just buying btc rather than waiting on a miner to mine the btc. It's how they soothe the pain of loss. It hurts when you make an investment and lose. Deep down they know they lost. But if they can pretend like they made a profit, they won't feel as bad. But you'll have more USD if you just buy the BTC and hold them. Why do you want less USD? Flashy video: Good at spending money on marketing, not on products.Here's a truly impressive video.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYyrNhLwrn0An actual working ASIC.

At the very least you come on here and post an update why you failed and the progress you did make. Silence? Unacceptable. How soon do you need the USD? USD wires to the US have basically stopped. The "2 week" backlog is now over 2 months long, and shows no sign of improving any time soon. If you can wait, ride the wave. Put in a buy order at $125 and end up with more BTC than you had. Great comparison.
I wish more ASIC vendors followed the PS4 pre-order model. I can pre-order a PS4 for 10% down. They can't. These hail-mary hardware vendors just aren't interesting to me anymore. They have nothing to show, but ask for everything up front. Now we have Bitfury putting out cutting-edge miners at reasonable prices with minimal lead times. Bitfury has set the bar. Long-term miners are going to shift to much cheaper electricity. .12 USD is not sustainable. Any "vendor hate" here is well deserved. bASIC fucked up. BFL fucked up. Avalon fucked up. Intentional or not, they fucked up big time. They deserve all the hate they're getting. You want to eliminate the hate? Eliminate the vendors that have fucked up. Give them 3 strikes if you feel generous. Miss 3 promises/dates/specs/etc. and you're banned from participating in this forum. Unfinished is fine if it works, and the sources are available for any open source software included in the delivery. You can't get a Jaly for $274 delivered in Aug. There's a backlog of orders. Retry your calcuation with a Oct delivery date and see if that is an attractive investment for you. The PS4 is a great example. Sony has a track record of releasing several generations of consoles, so there's not much risk that they won't release the PS4 near the scheduled date and specs. Prototypes have been demostrated in the public at numerous shows. 3rd party developers have confirmed the console exists and are working on games for it. The product already exists. It's not just a sketch on a napkin.http://www.intomobile.com/2013/08/20/walmart-begin-ps4-and-xbox-one-preorders-august-24th/Snag a pre-order for 10% down. That's how pre-orders should work.

Funds landed in my bank 3 days later. They keep repeating the same mistakes.1. The form factor. They keep trying to cram as much heat as possible into as small an enclosure as possible. Nvidia and AMD have trouble venting so much heat in such a package. BFL now has better cooling designers than Nvidia and AMD?2. Feature size. 28nm ASICS are much harder to get right than 65nm ASICs. Look at how long they took for 65nm and double it. That's what it's going to take.3. Progress? Ooh, they have a 3D model of a video card. Underimpressed. Tapeout hasn't happened. There's tons to do even after they reach tapeout.and so many more reasons. No, no, Honest Abe, they won't make the same mistake twice three times. Let's assume that BFL does everything perfectly and ships the Monarch in Feb. It's overpriced. KnCMiner, HashFast, CoinTerra, and BitFury will have better products long before then. The funny thing is they said the same things about the 65nm product. Honest Abe, the SC line will be blah blah blah. We know how that turned out. A while ago they had 75 wafers on order, with 1000 chips per wafer that's around 300 TH/s. Unfortunately they haven't announced ordering any more wafers. They're going to have to order a lot more wafers to reach 4 PH/s. Are you going to ask any tough questions, or just have a fun time there?Drop by bd's and have some good Mongolian for me. http://www.gomongo.com/locations/28057-bds-mongolian-grill-overland-park Absolutely. When a Fury-28tm comes along in 2014, we'll see the network reach a maturation point. These crazy performance charts we're watching grow now, will shift towards a Moore's law-like gradual improvement phase and mining will stabilize. Until then, it's the Wild Wild West of Bitcoin. At 10x current difficulty, it would be 30% for Avalon, but still only 3% for Bitfury.320-360 GH/s @ 250 watts, AT THE WALL. Then why bother mining? Just buy BTC and you'll make a better profit holding it than mining. Considering exchange rates is just a way to hide from the actual negative ROI.Paying $1000 (10btc @ $100) to mine $1500 (7.5btc @ $200) is a bad deal. You have a false $500 profit.Let's look at buying BTC instead: Buy 10btc @ $100, wait till the exchange rate goes to $200, you now have $2000. You have a true $1000 profit.The only positive ROI for a miner is more BTC generated than it cost to purchase it. Apples to apples. BTC in vs BTC out. Someday that will be a factor, but not for a while.Let's look at the power hungry Avalon.80 GH/s, 65M difficulty = $74/day income700 watts, $.15/kwh = $2.5/day expenseElectricity costs 3% of the income. That's pretty low.Or how about the Bitfury that is now shipping.360 GH/s, 65M difficulty = $330/day income250 watts, $.15/kwh = $1/day expenseBitfury has 10 times the efficiency of the Avalon. .3% of the income goes to electricity. That really is 'almost nothing'.
Don't be ridiculous. It's going to be quite some time before Avalon chips can't cover power costs. That would be between 320 and 360 GH/s at 250W = between .7 and .8 J/GH on a 55 nm product. I seriously hope the 28nm products can beat Bitfury's 55nm by a significant margin. "Perhaps"? No way! There's no way the bitcoin network is going to approach that kind of performance by the end of this year. Because there's a difference between "competition" and "unfair competition". Lying about things such as FCC certification to eliminate competitors falls under the "unfair competition" category. FALSE. "the order queue". There is one queue. All orders go into it. This is also proved by BFL claiming that upgrading an order, such as a Jalapeno to a Little Single, would not change the position of the order in the queue. They are lying about the order queue to this day.What hindsight? Those quotes are from BFL's website today. That's what they promised, so yes, they should have sat on them. Don't promise what you won't deliver. In fact, they're still promising it, and they're still not doing it. LIES. http://products.butterflylabs.comhttps://forums.butterflylabs.com/blogs/bfl_jody/310-monday-august-26-2013-shipping-upgrade.htmlProducts actually shipped far out of order. The order queue is a lie. Wrong again. They were due to ship in October, and had maybe 100 TH/s of pre-orders. Had they shipped every single unit on time on the same day, every customer would have made a killing on ROI. Instead, they delayed and delayed, allowing several competitors to crank up the network hashrate and eliminate any hope of BFL's products making ROI. So what do you think the following quote means?http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/Units? Not likely. That belongs to the tons of USB miners. Must mean hashrate.Or how about this one:They're claiming that nearly all of the hashrate increase is their products. First, BitcoinDF is not a charity, so there has been no 1000 btc donation to charity by BFL. Only a fraction of the BitcoinDF funds have actually been donated to charity.Second, no, I'm referring to the quote I posted, where Josh personally offers 1000 btc to charity. Here, I'll post it again.BFL donating some btc to charity doesn't fulfil Josh's promise. Can you quote such a notice or are you just imagining them sending such a notice? Where is the Japapeno test report Josh? Where's the 1000 BTC to charity Josh? Where is the Japapeno test report Josh? Sure they advertise it here. That's how they avoid the scammer tag. Still waiting on that 1000 BTC to charity donation. https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/helpcenter/article/?solutionId=39067&topicID=11500005&m=TCI20 days. BFL quoting 60+ days for delivery has always been in direct violation of PayPal policies. November network hashrate was about 25 TH/s. It is now over 525 TH/s. Thus, you are claiming you had "far in excess" of 500 TH/s worth of pre-orders in November. Prove it. How much hashrate worth of pre-orders did you have in November? Forget the tablet certification. That is a distraction Josh loves to grab on to.Is the two weeks up? Where is the Japapeno test report Josh? Why 27 PH/s? Isn't that in the neighborhood of 4B difficulty?
That does seem high. How do you get those numbers? Sure, it's a worst case estimate. But don't forget, difficulty is going to hit 65M today, so only 40x gets us to 2.6B. 100% increase each month gets us to 1B difficulty by end of year. That's not that unreasonable. There's a lot of hardware that's coming online Q4.  That'll take about 14 difficulty adjustments at 30% each. I think we'll reach that by end of this year. Ok, for this use case, restricting background data would do it. It doesn't eliminate wifi usage, but that isn't as important. I just have to remember to disable background data for bitcoin when I go roaming.A basic AT&T data plan is 300 MB. Look on the bright side, it's not as bad as the last one. The previous adjustment was +36%. Some pools do provide clean coins. I know at least p2pool does, and I'm sure there are some other pools that also mine blocks that pay out directly to the miners. And to keep this on-topic, will KnC's pool give out clean coins? I'm worried something bad has happened to Josh. Last post from BFL_Josh, October 05, 2012, 11:26:27 PM. I hope he's ok.

I wish it was that light on data. At this moment, Android is showing Bitcoin has downloaded 5.65MB out of the 66MB so far this billing cycle. That's a little heavy for a limited data plan. It's really painful when I go roaming internationally. Yes, the stupid ones get caught. But I'd say they are the minority. In this digital internet age, criminals are increasingly automated and in remote locations. Try sending some bitcoins to known compromised addresses. The coins will be stolen immediately. I realized my email was compromised when I watched a password reset email arrive and was instantly deleted. These things are automated and can be done by criminals from all across the globe. Tracking bitcoin thefts is going to become pointless for most thefts. They'll be stolen and mixed automatically. Yes, 20 BTC is better than 13 BTC and better than 10 BTC.

My package would be too big for her.
Bitfury has the smallest demonstrated chip at 55 nm. Aren't you glad that "products are shipped according to placement in the order queue"? Just think how mad you would be if people who ordered months after you got their products before you. Since Josh has never estimated delivery dates accurately, February is another BFL pipe dream. Anyone who buys these is an idiot. Reality. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=194078.0 They spent 200 bitcoins, now worth over 22000 dollars. They should have kept their bitcoins. They lost. Big! It'll definitely plateau. Not in 3 months for sure. Maybe in 6 months. Definitely before 12 months. Paypal isn't going to stand by and leave BFL's account in good standing while they take hit after hit of chargebacks. A run of Paypal chargebacks and then BFL stops accepting Paypal. I think there's a connection. Of course the October ship date is a pipe dream. If they really believed they could really ship in October, they'd offer refunds at that time, not 2 months later like they are doing. It's obvious because they no longer accept Paypal. Paypal has terminated BFL's account, so it's just going to get harder and harder to obtain a refund. Can you point to any customer that has received a USB-power Jalapeno?Shipping products that don't meet paid-for specs: Scammer.Lying about shipping dates: Scammer.Refusing refunds: Scammer.Failing to pay lost bets: Scammer. Congrats on achieving an F. Few companies are able to achieve such a great rating. Well done! Good to see BFL with the BBB rating they deserve. I'm enjoying CampBX. I can withdraw $1000/day and see the money clear my bank in about 2-3 days (through Dwolla for only $.25). It might have to do with his AG and BBB filed complaints. No, no, your previous estimates of October, November, December, January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September were quite accurate! He's working non-stop to take people's money? Wow, that is so unusual! As painful as this delay has been for me (still waiting on my June 26 withdrawl from MtGox), it's good for the economy. Having only 1 primary exchange is trouble. It's good to see BitStamp volume equal to MtGox. I'm enjoying CampBX with low fees and quick withdrawls, so I hope their volume improves too and I can send more business their way. Assuming nothing goes wrong, which it always does. Bitfury thought they had PCBs. Turns out the factory forgot 2 of the layers. Things can and will go wrong. Unless the items are already physically at TH, they are a risk factor. Pre-orders are fine when there is adequate consumer protection in place. Unfortunately, most ASIC vendors do not have it.
No they do not.1. PSUs: Not in2. Cases: Not in3. PCBs: Not in4. BOM components: Yes! Speaking of vanity addresses, I imported the private key for my nice firstbits vanity address and have been using it on my phone for a few months now. Is that vanity address now basically unusable? Since they won't give refunds until January, they actually anticipate to ship well past October. Don't give up. Call Paypal and explain how BFL is violating the Paypal Terms of Service.  Actually, they need new customers to pay for the refunds. https://www.kncminer.com/news/news-28Seems pretty clear to me. Avalons are DIY. There is no Customer Support. There is no Warranty Service. You are on your own. While not ideal, as long as it draws air in front-to-back, and there's room for the external power supply on a 19" width, it'll be fine in a rack. The reality is that because of BFL's inability to ramp up production, out of the bitcoin network's 400 TH/s, BFL hardware is a minuscule portion. Care to back up such a claim with any sort of proof? Ouch. And we just hit 50M difficulty. Let's see what an expert has to say about ROI. And the spamming has begun. Thanks KnC. A lot of US circuits are 15A @ 120V. Continuous load should stay under 80%. So 15 * 120 * .8Â  = 1440 watts max. Call them up and tell them how hard their delays have been on you, and let them know you'll be filing reports with the Attorney General and FTC if they refuse to honor your refund request. Hearing about small delays up-front (rather than weeks later) is a nice breath of fresh air. Keep up with the good communication. The plastic coated ones are nice because you can strip just the tips that go into the ATX plug, and you're left with a safe, plastic-coated, non-conducting loop sticking out. "Shipping in October" is a lie, and they know it, which is why refunds won't be honored until months later. Very slimy. Yes, it is bad. If they were so "confident" of their schedule, they'd back it with refunds begining end of Oct. Offering refunds months later means they're not actually confident at all. Oct 20 shipment is just a lie to snag sales away from competitors. Slimy. So confident in your schedule that you'll offer refunds in October, November, December, January 2014? That's not very confident at all! A big chip is not "orders of magnitude" more efficient than a bunch of small chips. That's just not how bitcoin hashing works.
Please remove xCrowd from your chart. The numbers are just not right. The xCrowd website isn't even available atm. Let them announce final numbers first. Just great. Now we're all going to be spammed with referral links everywhere. Really? You launched a multi-million dollar project on a $5 shared hosting solution? What kind of idiot are you? Blocks are flying past. We might hit 50M for the next adjustment. And of course, if you distribute any open source software you'll have the sources immediately available? That sounds about right. As such, with an expected December delivery, this is a disappointing offering. Those new high-end xCrowd numbers can't be right. Wow, that's how it works? The website just needs to have the words "for business use only" and they avoid all consumer rights laws? Refund policy? TH secretly snuck in a "no-refunds" policy at the last moment before opening up pre-orders. How about we do the math on the difficulty change?2012/10/17 = 1,468,2182013/08/06 = 37,392,766Difficulty has gone up 25x. That means that device is even less profitable now than when he made that comment. Although Josh was trying to trash a competitor, this is the one rare example where he turned out to be right. BFL is so late that their devices will never ROI. https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/helpcenter/article/?solutionId=39067&topicID=11500005&m=TCII'm not sure, but "2 months or more" may not meet the 20 day requirement. What do you think? Why won't BFL publish power usage for their units? Bitfury is way ahead of KNC. KNC hasn't even shown a chip, let alone a complete working mining solution. Bitfury has. That's the difference. Worst purchase ever. Had you simply kept the bitcoins you would have over half a million dollars instead of the crushed hope of having a mining device someday. Everything BFL says is deceitful. They want you to think they said the backlog would be cleared/shipped. All they said was it would be "processed". Processed doesn't mean shipped. You just admitted that BFL is running a Ponzi scheme. Welcome to the BIAS (Bfl Is A Scam) club. They will. Jody had to press keys on her keyboard more than 1100 times for that blog posting. The amount of frustration that comes from pressing so many keys in a single day is staggering! In comparison, your forum post wasn't even 500 keystrokes. Just imagine more than double the frustration. Now add to that all the pain caused by the carpal tunnel syndrome, especially when many of those keystrokes were capital letters requiring 2 keys to be pressed at the same time! Jody is being worked to the bone having to post a blog update every single day! Had you spent your dollars to buy btc directly you'd have made far more profit. You could have bought 23 btc which is now worth over $2400.
Oh, look, Josh (who is "not a BFL rep") is bidding on advertising again. I wonder who for? I bet it's for a bASIC ad this time. Who do you think he's advertising for? PPLNS is susceptible to variance. 24 hrs won't give you a good picture. You could end up with either a run of good luck or a run of bad luck. Show me where I can pre-order the new nVidia 980 GPU or the new Intel Broadwell CPU. As soon as I have those pre-orders fully paid for I'll let you know what tape-out dates they provide. Keep your fingers in your ears and chant, "Avalon is not shipping. Avalon is not shipping." That should make it true. If you've got a car, Computer History Museum is awesome.http://www.computerhistory.org/ Sure you are. You even bid for advertising here.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=259554.msg2777728#msg2777728 Their Chief Operating Officer is too busy trolling these forums to do his actual job. They're also waiting for new orders to come in so that they'll have funds to purchase parts for the orders placed a year ago. All the refunds from being so late are a huge drain on their cash flow. Inaba's "coat hanger" comment is right up there. BWAHAHA. Orders for things not in stock, not built, and delivered at an unspecified date. That's what a pre-order is. Duh! Your numbers are still a little mixed up.3 module avalon hashes between 72 and 84 mh/s and originally cost roughly 75 btc.4 module avalon hashes between 96 and 112 mh/s and originally cost roughly 100 btc. 20 grand for an Avalon in 3 months from now? If anyone is seriously considering buying from these people, PM me and we can work out a much better deal for the both of us. Good luck beating the other bitstreams. A lot of work has already gone into optimizing mining. And since FPGAs generate so little bitcoins now, and every day you delay finishing your bitstream that number dwindles even further, there's just not going to be any interest in paying more than a few pennies for a new bitstream. Of course they're mining live with them. They've even posted a screenshot of one of their devices mining on a public pool. For batch-3 devices that are delivered soon, you're looking at a 3-4 month ROI. Not bad, but not great. Any significant delay will kill that ROI as lots of hashing power is coming online late this year. What a joke.Wednesday, July 10, 2013 Shipping Update1 or 2 days turns in to 13+ days. The firmware they ship has a setting for 300 mh/s, so it's safe to include that speed in the chart.Most miners are using a custom firmware that autoclocks. 350 mh/s is typically about where the autotuning settles for Avalon-supplied boards. I would consider that overclocking, and not appropriate to include in the chart.To get the chips to go to 450, custom boards need to be used. All the multi-die packages I've seen leave a few mm of space between dies. So the actual die size is likely to be under 20x20 I just can't believe the die will turn out to be that large. Nobody builds 43x43mm dies. Look at it this way. You paid ~75 BTC for 84 GH/s and now have your miner in-hand. Think of all the BFL Singles that were purchased for 200 BTC for 60 GH/s, and they still haven't been shipped yet. You got a great deal! So they're paying contractors to develop software for their hardware. How is that a "donation to charity"?
It doesn't matter. At any price, at any time, 65 BTC is always worth more than 60 BTC. That's why the exchange rate never matters. Never. You can can't stop from claiming "First" when you're not the first. Not even close. This sure looks like bad mouthing to me: Think of all the people who upgraded their Jalapenos to Singles. They upgraded with the promise that their order wouldn't be delayed. It was clearly posted in their news blog.https://www.kncminer.com/news/news-22 In 4 months you'll be lucky to mine .5 btc per month. You'll never break even on a new Jalapeno. Maybe you should have thought of that before incorrectly announcing the "World's Fastest Bitcoin Mining Chip". Old Newshttps://www.kncminer.com/news/news-10New Newshttps://www.kncminer.com/news/news-22Specs changing over time isn't a "lie". Maybe you should apologize for falsely claiming to have the world's fastest bitcoin chip. Looks like they'll be 4 chips per module. So 25 GH/s. Still faster than VMC. 1,000 watts is a best-case senario, because KnC does not have actual chips to test. 400 watts vs. 1000 watts. Minirigs: First day.Singles: First day.Little Singles: First day.Jalapenos: Actually shipping. In the past 4 months they've shipped 4 months worth of Jalapeno orders. They are down to only 9 months worth of Jalapeno backlogs left to ship. In this videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by-je8XRCdYMarcus was claiming a 90x90 package size or bigger. I don't know what in the world he was thinking. Did I read that right, that they are putting 4 dies in each package? So each die will be roughly 20x20mm. A far more workable solution than the 90x90mm die they originally claimed. The blockchain on my phone is 1.06 MB. I think the blockchain is just fine in size. Was the amount the same quantity of btc that you paid with? DHL Global is really good, but it'll cost ya. My suggestion:UPS for US deliveries.USPS for International deliveries. In those 3 weeks BE's will mine about .2 BTC which makes their effective cost .69 BTC. Way cheaper than yours. K1's? You cannot "get then [sic]". You can only pre-order them to be delivered at a much later date. Tell me. What is your guaranteed delivery date?
Nice try deleting my comment in your propoganda sales thread. Here it is again so everyone gets a chance to read it without your censorship.What a shame. BE's are available today. K1's aren't. You aren't competitive. Drop your prices by at least 30% because by the time you actual have a product to ship that's what they'll be worth. This "Bitcoin Development Fund" isn't a charity. Mods, move this thread to Off-topic, or maybe Scam Accusations. A self-moderated thread from a questionable source does not belong here. It gives the false impression that there are no red flags when in reality the thread creator is deleting posts. Hashrate of a single chip is largely irrelevant. A board with 1 large chip or a board with 10 small chips are not significantly different.Delivery dates, cost, and power consumption are the key factors. Yes, that's right! When you get more btc than you spent, you've made a profitable investment. When you get less btc, you've lost. Mining hardware generates bitcoins. Not dollars. So it only makes sense to calculate ROI based on bitcoins. Bitcoins spent vs. bitcoins generated. Anything else is just to soothe your losses. Singles cost 200 btc back then and now generate 1 btc per day. ROI is already at 6 months assuming no difficulty increases. But as we all know, there's lots of increases on the way. A single delivered now will never break even. The sooner you get a refund, the sooner you can buy a quality product from people who know what they're doing.https://megabigpower.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=61 EU customers purchase at http://www.bitfurystrikesback.com/US customers purchase at https://megabigpower.com/shop/ KNC does not have actual chips yet.Bitfury has confirmed working chips and boards: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYyrNhLwrn0. Shipments due next month. It's not the pool connection. Something happens and all work ends up "discarded" until cgminer is restarted. What would cause that? Speaking of failure, let's take a look at Jody's blog.Wednesday, July 10, 2013 Shipping UpdateThursday, July 11, 2013 Shipping Update Friday, July 12, 2013 Shipping Update  * wifi is already disabled.* running at a moderate 300 mhz* other miners are connected to the pool just fineI don't see how restarting cgminer would fix a FPGA failure. So from that list of possibilities, pool issue seems most likely. I'll set a backup pool and see if it switches to that. I can watch MHS5s slowly drop to 0, and eventually cgminer-monitor will restart cgminer. Why is cgminer stopping hashing? The API log in the web interface just shows the current state of the system. Is there an actual log file somewhere else? syslog is simply showing that cgminer-monitor is running regularly. It doesn't show why cgminer died/restarted. My cgminer is restarting too frequently. Is there a log showing why it was restarted? I estimate a batch-3 delivered today to take about 3 months to break even (roughly 80 btc). Since batch-3 hasn't started shipping yet, that's an optimistic view. Difficulty increases are just going to accelerate over the next few months. Batch-3 will likely break even by the end of 2013. Not bad, but not great either. Still waiting on my wire transfer from 6/25. I call dibs. Now where did I leave that wallet with 4000 BTC lying around...
Quoted to preserve refund policy. No changing refund policy after receiving orders (like other less reputable companies are doing). https://terrahash.com/faq/Looks like their learned from the masters (BFL). Offer refunds in order to land a bunch of pre-orders, and then start refusing refunds without warning. Deceptive and nearly worthy of a scam label. Roughly 3600 new coins are minted each day. Mt Gox trades about 150,000 coins each day. Miners cashing out is a very small portion of the market. Define "minimum needed." I send a lot of transactions with 0-fee, and because I have old coins 0-fee is the minimum needed. Great firmware. Keep up the good work. Here's my 1 btc donation. It is sure nice of them to change their policies after people have already placed orders. Such integrity! What are the odds that DFI will file a response? Can they just drop it without any response? Maybe if this was the "SUPER-DUPER OFFICIAL TerraHash Thread", then they'd respond to it. As it is now, it's just any old "OFFICIAL" thread that may or may not be responded to. You have to look at it long-term. Dust outputs won't get spent. 100BTC outputs will get spent and pruned. KNC's chip is purely theoretical. How about making the target error rate a parameter? https://wyobiz.wy.gov/Business/FilingDetails.aspx?eFNum=149144214231010201167112190255028042109060235081BFL is a US corporation, but the owners are unknown.  That's pretty clear. If the merchandise has not been shipped, the customer may exercise his option to cancel and you must refund him. Just do like everyone else does. Make up some numbers and open your website for pre-orders. There's plenty of fools customers that will throw lots of money your way. Never? 300 MH/s will generate roughly 5 47-difficulty shares per hour. You must be a new miner. Welcome to the up-side of variation, aka good luck. Later you'll get to know the down-side, aka bad luck. Try again. It's .12. Well, Josh is an expert in missing targets. No one has missed more shipping dates, target specs, than he has. 1 share is worth about 1/100th of a penny. I'm ok with bitcoin not being able to flood the blockchain with .01c payments. Is this hardware error target per module? If one module has 3% error, and the other 2 modules have 0% error, that would be fine.
I like how Asicminer is going business. I won't buy any of their hardware simply because the price is outside my comfort zone on ROI. They did good this generation. But there's a new generation right around the corner that will obsolete them unless they upgrade. Most people are running their stock Avalon boards at 350 MHz, so 320 is quite disappointing. He also hassled Tom about bASIC energy claims. Let's see what Tom had to say.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1273803#msg1273803 That's a creative use of the term "now available". And now that they are refusing refund requests, I guess you agree they have successfully risen to scam status. 1 BTC is worth 1 BTC. Paying 2000 BTC to get less than 2000 BTC is a bad deal. The website has always said that, but they have stated time and time again to not worry about that. They will refund anyone. Well, Inaba lied. Again. Really? You have no problem with them promising refunds publicly, and then switching without warning to a "no refunds" policy?LOL. How's the crow taste? Why are you selling devices that will "never see a positive ROI"? So why all the secrecy? Why not just answer some of the easy questions in the article?Who are the owners of BFL?What do Chris and Sonny actually do?Who owns the Bitcoin Development Fund?What is its official status?When are you going to donate 1000 BTC to actual charities? 13% is a very optimistic view. The last 10 difficulty increases have been roughly 20% per adjustment. New USB miners used to be 2 BTC, and their price was just dropped to 1 BTC.New Blades used to be 50 BTC. Best of luck getting more than about 25 BTC. Then the network is more secure against 51% attacks. That's a good thing. Avalons come with several (3-4) modules. Can each module be clocked individually? The stock Avalon firmware comes with settings for 282 and 300. Third-party firmwares are overclocking to 350 and above. Please add 450 MHz as Ludicrous speed It depends a little on the fiat exchange rate. The fees average roughly $31 for me.

No need to make excuses for him. Let's see what he has to say...Actually, he is a PR guy.Quite an interesting way of handling PR. Sounds like the best they've done before is a 40nm hardcopy. In Inaba's farm. 2000 BTC invested in a BFL pre-order 1 year ago now generates 13 BTC a day! Wow!!! This *might* break even someday.100 BTC invested in an Avalon pre-order 9 months ago has already made back its investment several times over. "Came through"?! It was supposed to be 1500 GH/s @ 1500 watts in October '12. Now it's 500 GH/s at 2400 watts in June '13. They didn't "come through". They blew it. Oh, the massive rise is just getting started. Do you like less bitcoins or more bitcoins? Buying a miner that generates less bitcoins than it cost to purchase it just leaves you with less bitcoins to use. Avalon batch3 will arrive long before your device. Therefore your device is worth much less than the Avalon pre-order.75 BTC several months ago had a great chance at decent ROI. 75 BTC now for a device several months from now is questionable whether it will ever break even. Duh! Of course you need to convince miners to mine your transactions. That's the way it has always been. That's the way it will always be.If you want miners to mine your spammy dust transactions, then attach a nice big fee to it. You'll have plenty of miners willing to mine it for you.Your problem is you want to send dust without paying for it. So many things can go wrong. Timing signals/voltage drops across the whole die, low wafer yields, too much heat, etc. That sounds like trouble waiting to happen. Low cost, but very long wait time, which obscures their true cost. Their true cost is extremely high because of the rising difficulty. BFL ASICs where supposed to ship when the difficulty was 2 million. Now it's over 15 million and rising, and most BFL customers haven't received their units yet. 10 months if the difficulty doesn't go up. But it will. You will never get back the BTC you spent. BFL is the only one who will profit from your purchase. Beautiful. BFL Press ReleaseRed flag #1: Executives that won't post their real name.Red flag #2, an unnamed venture firmRed flag #3, and indeterminate amount of investment.Sketchy, and thus likely to be misleading. Most likely it wasn't a real venture firm.Now let's look at a real company with real venture investment.http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130516005639/en/BitPay-Raises-2-Million-led-Founders-FundExecutives using their real names, real verifyable venture firms, investing a real amount of money. That's how a real venture investment works.If I had to guess, the BFL "investment" was simply Sonny using some of his stolen funds from his previous scam. They can only be profitable after they reach break-even point, which is going to be several months (or maybe even never) after the device starts mining. Because they wouldn't be able to spend it. I think you may want to adjust that estimate. Recently announced projects are claiming way better than .5btc per gh/s.Bitfury, 20btc for 120 gh/s = .167btc per gh/sKNCMiner, 60btc for 350 gh/s = .17btc per gh/s Yup. What's going to happen is the next gen asics will arrive (in the next 3-6 months) that will make all the current gen asics unprofitable. It's a simple extrapolation of future difficulty increases. No one who has received a BFL unit will mine more BTC than they spent purchasing the unit. They lost.
GF now produces fully packaged and tested chips? Or do the chips get ordered from GF, then sent to a bumper, then sent to a packager, etc.? How much experience does Orsoc really have producing 28nm chips? I glanced around their website and the only chip I could find they designed was 180nm.It's not just rookie mistakes. Designing state-of-the-art chips takes serious time. You don't just whip one up as a summer project. QFT.Anything else is just self delision to try to soothe the pain of failure. Exactly! Every single BFL customer is a loser. There's no way they'll finish up a 28nm miner by September. P2pool does not work with Avalons, so I wouldn't expect Avalon-related projects to work with p2pool either. https://wyobiz.wy.gov/Business/FilingDetails.aspx?eFNum=149144214231010201167112190255028042109060235081 Here's just the most recent one.https://forums.butterflylabs.com/pre-sales-questions/3026-forced-refunds.html#post37336BFL forced a refund on Xian01. Actually, no. The "Bitcoin Development Fund" is not a charity. BFL is the one claiming to be donating to charity. If they were going to donate the 1000 btc to the community, or to random people, or something else, then they should have said so. But they promised to donate the 1000 btc to "charity". I don't care if Kano is Satoshi himself. He is *not* a charity. All "donations" to non-charities need to be removed from their fake charity page. That's nice, but are you a "charity"? Metabank is selling them for $2160, and you're reselling them for $3240. What service are you providing for that 50% profit margin? How about for failing to pay up on bets posted on this forum? Maybe Xian01's order isn't cancelled after all.https://forums.butterflylabs.com/pre-sales-questions/3026-forced-refunds.html#post37336 Please, don't lump Avalon in with BFL. Avalon #1 was originally scheduled for a Feb shipment, and they shipped most in Feb and Mar. That's pretty close to on-time. Batch #2 is maybe 1 month late.BFL originally scheduled for a Oct shipment, and 7 months later has hardly shipped squat. There's no comparison. That is choice. They are excited about missing their targeted power spec by only 500%. WTG! I agree the EarthWatts 650 isn't enough. Mine just died. The Avalon is just too much for it.

Thanks for adding idle notifications. It has been nice knowing when to reboot. What makes you think it is working? All I've seen is pics of a PCBA with no pics of any actual mining going on.
It's the latest BFL scam. Cancelling orders that were sold at $149 so that they can sell them to another customer at $249. They made sure to imply it would be extremely unlikely for the date to change. Read their own words:http://www.butterflylabs.com/bitforce-sc-release-notes/Even as late as mid October, they were claiming they would ship in October. Pretty good analogy, but cars are even better.Customer goes to a car dealership, picks the car he wants but it isn't in stock, so he's told it will be delivered in 2 months, and he pays the current price for the car in full at that point in time. 2 months pass, and the car he ordered is delivered to the dealership. The dealership sees that he can sell the same car to a new buyer for 67% more. So he calls up the original customer and says, sorry, I changed my mind, you can't have that car after all, because I'd rather sell it to someone else for more money. Here's your money back. Early pre-orders paid about 25 btc. At today's difficulty, a Jalapeno will take over 120 days to break even, assuming no difficulty increases. But there will be lots of increases, so it's unlikely that an early pre-order will ever break even. So no, Jalapenos are not worth it. That's a very nice improvement in power usage over batch #1. Why not? There have been numerous threads detailing the lost bet.7 months later and still no donation. Why doesn't Inaba have a scammer tag? He's new here, his account was created 3 weeks ago. So he's not aware of the missed October, and the missed November, and the missed December, and the missed January, and the missed February, and the missed March, and the missed April, and the missed May. It will be quite a few months from now before difficulty rises enough to make electricity costs a significant portion of the profit equation. So I'll rephrase my point...A Jalapenos pre-order purchased for 25 btc needs to generate more than 25 btc to break even. I don't understand your Avalon entry. Avalon batch #1 finished shipping a while ago. Avalon batch #2 is currently being shipped. Avalon batch #3 will ship in a month or two. BFL is cancelling pre-orders that paid $149, so that they can sell them at the new $249 price point. Extremely disreputable business practice. "Refusing" a purchase is very different than accepting payment, failing to deliver the goods, raising the prices, and forcing a refund on a customer. While it may not be literally illegal, it is scammy. I just love seeing these brand new accounts coming to BFL's defense after missing 7+ months of deadlines. Quite entertianing. Thanks Josh. Let me know what business you run, so I can stay far away from it. In the SHOUTING title it states clearly "NOW AVAILABLE". It is not. The SHOUTING title is absolutely misleading.Mods, move this thread.Nothing is "now available", and the SHOUTING title deserves to have this thread dumped to either Scam or Off-topic. That's why it makes far more sense to eliminate the fiat exchange rates and calculate profits based solely on bitcoins spent to purchase the equiment and bitcoins generated by the equipment. A Jalapenos pre-order purchased for 25 btc needs to generate 25 btc to break even. How about idle miner notifications? So the new minirig at 500 GH/s would draw 3000 watts. That will require a 40A/110V circuit! So they're going to start shipping in two weeks? Just like back in Oct? And Nov? And Dec? And Jan? And Feb? And Mar? And Apr? And May? Notice a pattern yet? There's no need to discredit Sonny. He's a convicted felon. He discredited himself when he got involved with illegal activities and got caught. You seem to think felonies are no big deal. Is that because you have some on your own record? "mere conviction"? They extradicted his ass from Italy and threw him in prison for a couple years. Small time crooks don't get such serious treatment.
It takes a special kind of person to defend a felon convicted of scamming millions of dollars from senior citizens. You can look at historical growth rates. Recently it has been slighter over 1% per day, and it will probably continue like that for a few months as ASICs continue coming online. Beyond a few months there's no telling what will happen.http://bitcoin.sipa.be/growth.png Notice how he just says they will be "selling" them. Not that they'll actually ship them in any reasonable amount of time. Yes, the settings suggested solved my performance issues. 8.2rc1 helps a little, but whatever transactions are still floating around are causing significant performance issues to gtblocktemplate. You can count on the Avalon chips arriving months ahead of the BFL unit. Smart move. The Avalon chips will make up for your losses from ordering a BFL. You can already mine any of the sha256 cryptocoins just by pointing your Avalon to the correct daemon/pool. I'm curious, when do you think you'll receive your order? Code:blockmaxsize=250000I'm going to try this. I can't allow those monster transactions. "We'll ship in October." "We'll ship in November." "We'll ship in December." "We'll ship in January." "We'll ship in February." "We'll ship in March." "We'll ship in April." "We'll ship in May."No, this is BFL's fault. They are the one doing all the "poking". Wow, that is one very bad transaction. Josh has threatened customers before. Get on his bad side and he'll make sure your order has problems. ROFLMAO. BFL is ordering batches of 100 chips and then taking a few weeks to build them into products. Day 2 pre-orders might get theirs by the end of summer. Feb pre-orders will be lucky to have them by the end of the year. Why would you think something delivered later to be worth the same as something delivered earlier? The only time bitcoin was close to an open market was when CPU mining was effective. Then, anyone with a computer could simply download the app and start mining. Now that ASICs are available, there is momentum in bringing new hardware online. Miners were purchased months ago, and they will continue arriving and coming online over the next few months. Difficulty increases are going to accelerate as delivery catches up with orders. Past performance may not be a guarantee, but it sure is a good indiction of future growth. That's a lot of heat in a small box. Are you sure you can cool that good enough? Don't look at a single difficulty adjustment. Look at a couple months worth.http://bitcoin.sipa.be/growth.pngThe network has been growing at over 1% per day for the last two months. Over the next few months we'll be seeing that increase, as Avalon, BFL, and even Asicminer start ramping up ASIC production. Yes. The 1200w is the output rating, and the 1290w is the input measurement. Due to conversion loss, the 1290w input is roughly 1120w output (1290 x .87). Well under the 1200w output rating. Unlikely. BTC/month will go about like this:10, 7, 5, 3.5, 2.5, 1.75 = 29.75 btc in 6 months. The chance of making back 50 btc, ever, is relatively small.
These are unlikely to break even in under 6 months. Maybe 12 months. That's too long a time frame for my investment comforts. What do you mean it's not recent? Why is it on their official forums, and it is a stickied post so that it shows up at the top of the page? Is BFL so overworked that they cannot keep their own stickied posts current? Oh, wait, Josh has plenty of time to troll dozens of threads every day on bitcointalk.org, so clearly not having time isn't an issue. It can only mean that they intent deceive as many people as possible to think that is accurate.

Near zero, at least until they produce an FPGA miner successfully. Avalon designed, built, and sold FPGA-based miners. Their products were already in customers' hands hashing away on the bitcoin network.BFL designed, built, and sold FPGA-based miners.

CedarTec has nothing. Intentional scam or not, there is no chance of them producing what they're claiming to do. Ouch! That's more power than Avalon. 620/68 = 9.150/5.35 = 9.4And running at 80c it's not going to have a very long life. Please consider doing a 2-chip version. Downclocked to 256 mhz would be a really nice usb stick. If they can't give a shipping date, then they shouldn't be taking people's money! Avalon chips will be a couple months off (they even announced they would be), but they're not vaporware. Avalon has shipped roughly 72000 chips. BFL has shipped roughly 70. Give the lady a break. She's soldering as fast as she can. 35 Jalapenos (2 chips each) out of 5000 chips = 1.4% wafer yield. I guess their 100% wafer yield estimate was off just a little. USB 3 would be fine. Even my laptops have USB 3. This: Would that include the ASIC, or is that separate? Let me know if you have any other bitcoins. You clearly want to throw them all away. Send them to me instead. I'll send you some pictures of real ASICs in exchange. That's way more than you'll get out of the CedarTec scam. You wish. Difficulty is going up a lot. You'll be lucky to mine a single btc in the next year.

Zero orders will ship within 2 months, so the statement is a lie. Where else do you think the recent network hashrate increase came from?

Let me quote an authority for you.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#Half-truthhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#Misleading_and_dissembling So why is the 5 GH/s unit shipping without FCC approval?  You can't build an ASIC product overnight, which is what they keep claiming to do. In mid-Oct they claimed they'd still ship in Oct, yet they had no chips or anything close to a working product. Their schedule has been impossible to meet. That can only mean they lied about it. No, it's a lie. There is no chance they will ship in two months. Zero. None. To imply otherwise is deceitful and misleading. Simply put, a lie. http://products.butterflylabs.com/homepage/50-gh-s-bitcoin-miner.htmlThere is zero chance of any order placed today shipping in 2 months. In fact, I am so sure of that, that I'm prepared to make a double-or-nothing bet with BFL right now.As soon as Inaba accepts this bet, I will place an order for 10x 50 GH/s Singles.* If they are shipped within 2 months of the date the order is placed, I will send BFL the same number of bitcoins that I sent to place the order.* If they are not shipped within 2 months of the date the order is placed, BFL send me the same number of bitcoins that I sent to place the order.Fine print: I will post the txid of the bitcoin transfer for payment of the order as soon as it is placed. "shipped" means the product is shipped by a regular shipping company (USPS, UPS, FedEx, OnTrac) and a valid tracking number for that package is emailed to me. When I receive the package and verify the contents as the actual product expected I will send the bitcoins to BFL. If BFL loses the bet, they will send me the bitcoins within 3 business days of the end of the 2 months. Losing the bet does not mean my order is cancelled. I still expect to receive the product as originally ordered, win or lose.If Inaba will not accept this bet, I demand that Inaba and all the other BFL accounts be tagged with "scammer" tags.
Why, is this your thread?The OP asked for opinions, so I'm giving them. Get a refund and toss your money into the stock market and make 10% per year rather than wait 2-3 years for a chance to break even. Or if you really do believe in bitcoins, buy some and make a killing in a couple weeks. Break even after 2-3 years is horrible returns. BFL pays quite a bit in advertising on this forum. There's no chance of the mods tagging Inaba with a scammer tag. Blame Josh. He's the BFL representative that's stoking the fire anytime he can. He thinks it brings him more business. Let's take BFL at their word, they can ship 400 units a day. An order placed today will likely take 6 months to arrive. That's 73,000 units, roughly 50 times the current network size. So when that Single is delivered, it'll make .05 btc/day. But it costs 18 btc today. That puts the ROI at roughly 1 year after the 6 months for delivery. 18 months from today just to break even and get the BTC back you previously spent on it.I'll make you an even better deal. Send me 18 btc today and in 1 year I'll give you 20 btc. That's 11% profit for you. Way better than buying a Single today. That would only be true if no other ASICs were brought online by any other manufacturer. Fat chance of that. Lots of ASICs are going to make the difficulty skyrocket long before BFL ships a bunch of Singles. Thanks alot, now I got that song stuck in my head!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbVtwRrX1hE Maybe that BFL_Josh guy can give you some pointers. Oh, you mean the 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 rule for delivery they promised and now are ignoring? Definitely. And with the efficiency of 7xxx cards, it takes a lot fewer cards to reach 10 TH/s than before. Your only option right now would be 600 of the 5 GH/s units. I'd like to see that.  And if BTC had gone to zero, he'd also have 23 BTC. See how the exchange rate is completely irrelevent? Mining hardware generates BTC no matter what the exchange rate is, so BTC is how you have to evaluate its ROI. Theymos' opinion is that scammers are just fine and don't get a tag as long as they don't do the scamming on the forums. Think again. You paid about 23 BTC 10 months ago. You'll make .3 btc/day. Even if the difficulty doesn't skyrocket (which it will), you need more than 2 months to just break even. You aren't making any profit for a long time. Don't forget the "voucher" is now only good to be used on the new products which have had their prices jacked way up. Because BFL started. It was a BFL shill that gave all the other ASIC producers a hard time claiming they better get FCC approval or they would be shut down. Then BFL reinforced it by claiming to have FCC approval in the works to scare the other ASIC manufacturers away. Now it turns out BFL never did have FCC approval in the works, and it was simply a scare tactic to eliminate any competition. Avalon isn't a US company, nor did they ever claim to have applied for FCC approval. BFL hasn't shipped any Jalapenos. Jalapenos were flat USB-powered silent mining devices. 5 GH/s = 30 watts25 GH/s = X wattsCan you solve for X? Did you even bother to read the quote I quoted? "the original Single SC case"
Not when they stick it in a closed case with minimal ventilation. What idiots. The Single case was originally designed for 20 watts, and that's a nice thermal envelope for it. Then when reality hit and the actual FPGA single output 80+ watts, they had to stick another loud fan underneath it to keep it alive. Now they want to cram some 150 or more watts into the same case?

"BitForce SC Jalapeno: a USB powered coffee warmer providing 3.5 GH/s, priced at under $149"That "USB powered" sure looks like a power spec to me. 5.3 GH/s @ 36 watts + 20 watts for laptop = 10.6 watts/ghps68 GH/s @ 620 watts = 9.1 watts/ghpsEfficiency: Avalon5.3 GH/s @ $149 = $28/ghps68 GH/s @ $1500 = $22/ghpsPrice: AvalonJune 2012 -> May+++ 2013 = 11+++ monthsSep 2012 -> Apr 2013 = 7 monthsTime to market: AvalonTriple crown goes to: Avalon! That's not what the demo showed, now was it? They showed the power draw minus the computer, which is not a fair comparison to a complete Avalon. You can't compare the wattage on a BFL with an Avalon. An Avalon is a self-contained mining device. Add in the wattage for the laptop and the BFL is less efficient than an Avalon! ROFLMAO.
Why not? Because ORSoC isn't really on the project, are they?ORSoC ABTelephone: +46 8 24 84 04Anyone want to give them a ring? It's a great hoppable chain. With the wild difficulty swings, you can hop on and mine a few blocks when it is low, and then hop off and let the less wise miners mine at the greatly increased difficulty. He got paid alright. BFL is running a prototype at their warehouse and letting Luke-jr have all the bitcoins generated by it.http://eligius.st/~wizkid057/newstats/userstats.php/1CdcYVP4T4hjHwt353pEnGHrigeDLvuvZL It would sure be nice if Avalon would release the PCB sources. The Avalon is built around a 10-chip module. That would be a great starting place. I'm watching a ton of orphans (100's) coming in on my Terracoin server. Is there a block explorer website that will show what's going on? I'm surprised this didn't happen with more systems. There needs to be top supports if they're going to ship them fully assembled. They are ready for full production! Of course he owns them. He created all the private keys used by the trusted nodes. But BFL didn't ship anything! Luke-jr posted a picture taken by Josh at BFL factory. The device never left the factory. Switch to the latest latest.http://downloads.qi-hardware.com/people/xiangfu/avalon/next-testing/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory-20130410.bin No, it does not exist. They are simply selling pre-orders. If it actually existed, it would be a great buy right now. But there is no such product actually available. Just the opposite. Someone is accumulating a ton of TRC with a small investment in hashing power. 34? Looks more like 28 GH/s.http://eligius.st/~wizkid057/newstats/userstats.php/1CdcYVP4T4hjHwt353pEnGHrigeDLvuvZL The problem is the difficulty adjustment algorithm is exploitable, and that's what someone is doing. Ok, so which shipping service did BFL use to ship your Little Single to your house? I regret not buying coins after the first bubble burst. I'm not going to make that same mistake again. This burst bubble is just setting up Bitcoin for another all-time high in the coming months. Look, you're not getting your order in 2-4 weeks. You're not getting it in 3-4 months. BFL hasn't shipped a single unit. There are 6 months of orders ahead of yours. Of course you realize this, which is why you're trying to get rid of your pre-order. Then you don't understand the full scope of how deep their lies go. In mid Oct 2012, they were saying "Honest abe, we're shipping in October. We're world leaders in microprocessor design!" Now it's mid Apr 2013 and nothing has changed. Oct shipping was a lie. Nov shipping was a lie. Dec shipping was a lie. Jan shipping was a lie. Feb shipping was a lie. Mar shipping was a lie. Apr shipping is their latest lie. What delivery service did BFL use to deliver your Little Single to your house?
The main problem is the code allows the difficulty to drop by 90%. This is highly exploitable. This isn't the first time an alt-coin made the mistake of asymmetric difficulty adjustment problems. And there they are. Blocks 103018 at 18:52 through 103036 at 19:11. Actual clock is only 18:57. He's generating blocks ahead of time, and into the future. Last block was at 18:31:35 at difficulty 27431. At 18:51:35 difficulty drops to 2743. He has been mining that block and the ones after it for the last 15 minutes. When 18:51 comes he'll drop a chain of blocks already pre-generated at the lower difficulty. Watch for it. Yes, he does have some mining power, but he's leveraging the time-travel exploit to multiply his hashing power by 10x or more. Watch the time stamps. He's generating the blocks ahead of time and then dropping them all on the network at once. Some is time-travel exploiting the new difficulty calculation right now. The generated coins are going to:http://cryptocoinexplorer.com:3750/address/111exFkjLXP5mXmEfVqGd2r7bXQhVhux3 It wouldn't be the first time. I'll point an Avalon at TRC for .2 BTC/hour. Send the BTC to 1HycC6KJQrBubLB5uTKAVqe3CXavoNzR3r if you're interested. You can transfer up to $10,000 per month via bank wire anonymously at MtGox. http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator Because their lies have damaged the Bitcoin mining market. By promising impossible price, performance, and dates, they tied up millions of dollars worth of capital that should have gone towards good companies that would have created a competitive ASIC and/or FPGA market. The first option has been proven time and time again. Here's just one example for you.The FCC has no record of any such device. Inaba was flat out lying. You're stupid for thinking they're only incompetent. They are also deceitful. Define "accept". Which shipping company delivered the ASIC to your house? When was it delivered?  Who do you think is creating all that new hardware? People don't just pick it up at the neighborhood Walmart. Yeah, they look like they're just sitting on top of the board, not actually mounted to it. Fake. FTFY. As a buyer you may think $20k is fair value, but as a seller your offer is an insult. Avalon is making 4.5 BTC/day at the newly adjusted network rate. In 3 months that's 400 BTC, so that's a good starting point. I would only accept BTC offers. Any other payment method is not worth the risk.  It's right on the order page.
Keep dreaming. We all know they'll take a lot of money before having/showing a real product. No, they won't. You don't understand how difficult the process is to create your own working Bitcoin mining ASIC. Bitpay needs to shut that down asap. Looks decent. Can you resize it so that one module has the same cross section as a fan. That way each module can be fitted in a nice case with one fan blowing across the heatsink. I think those would work quite well.How about an 80mm fan? Put 16 chips in a 4x4 arrangement, and you'd have a really nice little 4 GH/s box. Truly impressive. I can't wait to see a bunch of ASICs join p2pool. The only reason the bet was called into question was due to your deceitful post. So, yeah, you are a party to the scam. No. Bitcoin is and always will be proof of work. How dare you customers ask when you'll get the product you ordered last year! Just remember, "all sales are final". That's true if you don't care about security. But if you want that miniscule bit of data to be secure, there is a real cost to achieving that security. What happened to Exodus-20-16? You do not "have" the device. BFL has it sitting on their desk, using their internet connection, powered by their electricity. He sure liked to smack-talk Avalon. Now that Avalon has shipped quiet a few units, and BFL power usage has skyrocketed while performance has plummeted, Josh has sure been quiet. Come on, Josh. Make fun of all those Avalons cranking out 5 BTC/day. Let me guess. You're new here?They've been saying they'll ship in October, then November, then December, then January, then February, then March, and now April. They've shipped absolutely nothing the whole time. You can't honestly believe you'll get a device in July/August. If you're lucky, you'll have it just in time for Christmas. Sucker. There is zero chance of you getting your product in 2 months. Use the $650 to buy bitcoins and in 6 months when BFL starts shipping, you'll look at the value of your bitcoins and be so glad you didn't waste your money on a pre-order now. No, it's not even close. There are numerous points that are clear cut to anyone with half a brain.I sure wish I could use the ignore button on admins. I just sent $400 by Western Union to China. It cost me $25.I could send that same $400 by Bitcoin to China for $.07.Clearly, the fees are far too low. That's so they don't have to honor long-term warranties. The pre-orders were all for Jalapenos, Little SCs, SCs, and MiniRigs and come with "lifetime" warranties. Lifetime being as long as the product is in production. Now there's a new line of products. All those "lifetime" warranties are now 1-year warranties. Which product "shipped" reached 75% of the announced hashrate. 1, 2, or 3? Same as before. With nothing. Of course he's in on it. They're paying him $250/day.
The bet was delcared a draw. BoB took their cut, and refunded the rest back to both sides. Irrelevent. The bet clearly stated the 3 products. BFL did not ship any of them. The 75% hashrate requirement was not met. The bet should have been declared won for this point alone. There's no way you can honestly disagree. That's the new Little Single. 1 chip per motherboard. 1 fan per motherboard. Just wait until you see the Big Single. I bet if they put the Single motherboard in the box of fans, that'll be fine. I've dealt with a lot of fraud over the years. Nothing ever comes of the "investigations". The new name and address where this package was redirected to isn't the actual person comitting the fraud. They're not that stupid. Yes, I regret not dumping 200 BTC into a Single 10 months ago. That 200 BTC is now worth $28,000. I am so sad! And the package is listed as $299 value. Realistically, they're not going to do anything over such a cheap package. I thought that image was 'shopped. But no, that image is for real!Oh, look, they won't specify power usage anymore. WTG BFL. Don't confuse input wattage to output wattage. The PSU is rated at 650 watts output. When the input wattage is 640, the output more like 500-550 watts (depending on efficiency), so that's fine for a decent PSU. Yes, it most cleary was: After sanding off the Avalon logo on the chips. Not an option. The terms of the bet clearly specified which products.http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=701http://news.yahoo.com/butterfly-labs-announces-next-generation-asic-lineup-054626776.htmlThere is no "Little Single" included in the bet. The bet was clearly won. BoB called it a draw incorrectly. That is unless they are sending 24 GH/s units to all Jalapeno orders.  Which product are you referring to? The bet clearly specified 3 products. Were you testing a Jalapeno?http://news.yahoo.com/butterfly-labs-announces-next-generation-asic-lineup-054626776.html 75% of 40 GH/s is 30 GH/s. The device didn't come close to the required speed for the bet. The bet was clearly won. How's that tracking number working for you? That "title" is the actual bet. It is also confirmed by BoB that the title is important to all other bets. They just selectively ignored it for this bet because it wasn't the outcome they needed.Neither listed condition was met either. It's a fail all around. He tries not to lie, and to answer truthfully he would have to admit being paid, so he won't answer you.He is being paid $250/day. BFL is running a prototype and pointing the miner output to Luke-jr's wallet. You can watch the stats posting bitcoins to his wallet at:http://eligius.st/~wizkid057/newstats/userstats.php/1CdcYVP4T4hjHwt353pEnGHrigeDLvuvZL Luke-Jr, since you avoided the question I take that as confirmation that the device in question is at BFL's shop. BFL did not ship anything. At what location is the device? BFL ad on bitcointalk.orgActual price on BFL website:$29,899 is not $29k. More BFL deception. Stop the ads Theymos.
That's ok, sometime people hear what they want to hear. You misheard them. Josh actually said:"one of the first" That means near the front, but not the actual first. You are getting a device sooner than your order number in compensation for working on the miner. It's ok to be compensated for your work. You don't need to feel bad and lie about it. No, they are not.Condition 1 not met:The posted photo was created by a BFL employee. Not credible.Condition 2 not met:None of those products was shown in the photo.So to call a draw you ignore the title text and you ignore the facts in both conditions. Major fail. Yes, BFL is moving his order to the front of the line. Having the first hashing device will provide quite a nice profit for him. Great to hear! Did you see the giant bolded text at the top of the page?See that word "ship". Nothing shipped. Theymos, when are you tagging BFL/Inaba with scammer tags? They are still advertising a shipping date that has passed, for like the 6th time. Enough is enough.https://products.butterflylabs.com/featured-products/60gh-bitcoin-miner.html There's nothing to debate about. You must consider all of the text of the contract. The title is part of the contract. You cannot ignore it. The title says "shipped", and BFL didn't "ship" anything. Case closed. The actual title makes it pretty clear: "Butterfly Labs will not ship ASIC-based Bitforce SC products before April 2013"A prototype sitting on a bench at BFL does not qualify as "shipped", no matter how much you fondled it. Unfortuanately, Bitsyncom used a forwarding service to save money on shipping. It is this random forwarder that actually ships them with DHL. Bitsyncom chose a forwarder that won't provide him with the tracking numbers, so he can't provide them to his customers.Bitsyncom, stop using that forwarding service! Sure, the bet could have been worded more clearly, but the intent of the bet is clear. The photo was taken by BFL at a BFL facility, and thus doesn't qualify as a credible photo. Then where are the posted photos taken by yourself at your delivery location? Re-posting photos of devices at the factory doesn't count.I just love all the debate about an April Fools post. Truly the mark of a good fooling. Times up, theymos. Ban BFL ads and tag BFL/Inaba with scammer tags. They've missed far too many "deadlines". Time for SolidCoin 4.0? You're new to this Internet thing, aren't you?http://lmgtfy.com/?q=9000&l=1 No video? No working prototype. https://products.butterflylabs.com/featured-products/60gh-bitcoin-miner.htmlI expect to not see a single more BFL ad as of 4/1. p2pool is not an option at this time, there's too many issues with Avalon mining on p2pool. Hopefully the issues will be fixed before batch-2 ships. No, that's not what they said. Look into it, and you'll find they said something very different. A double-spend would be pretty easy if the purchase transaction was sent without a fee, then the double-spend transaction was sent with a standard fee.
Cool graph. Can you add some marks for some interesting percentages? Like where in the graph does 90% land? Why would they price it compared to a vapor-ware product that doesn't exist? Stop right there. No way is BFL shipping 100 units a day right off the bat. They've never pulled off that kind of throughput. So true. Avalons exist and make tons of money. BFL Singles don't exist and make no money. They stopped selling FPGAs 6 months months ago. They're living off investor (aka pre-orders) funds, which must be drying up since they've switched to "all sales are final" policy. Think of it more as a default ip, it can and should be changed. Just don't power them all up on the same ethernet network before you reconfigure them. Boot one up at a time and reconfigure it. Fees only matter to the first confirmation.

Everything else is contracted out to 3rd parties. You're right. When BFL launches in 4-6 months, Avalon will have a hard time selling 110nm technology. I suspect the price of batch #3 is going to give Avalon the funds they need to improve their process node. Sounds like the IPO in the first place should have never been offered. It is in direct violation of his own promise to avoid a "conflict of interest". http://dustcoin.com/mining Not a chance. BFL has demonstrated time and time again their inabaility to do anything on schedule.Their first batch of chips will only add approximately 35 TH. Plan on that being delivered in the next couple months at best. You could get a good start by investigating the Icarus board.http://en.qi-hardware.com/wiki/Icarus Stop right there. The days of people buying FPGA miners are rapidly coming to an end. ASICs are available and cranking up the network difficulty. By the time you develop a new FPGA miner, they won't be profitable. If you want to build an FPGA miner as a hobby, that's cool. But forget about making a business out of it. The most you'll get from them is "don't worry, it's on its way". Check with DHL every day. Eventually it'll show up there. BTC sent on 9/26 and order marked "Payment Completed" on 9/27. DHL finally received my package today, more than 2 months after "we shipped". Order #1xx. Seems the units were not shipped in order.
Because "the pcbs are completely finished" was another lie. Every time it goes up another $10 I panic and sell about 1% of my holdings. It's been a very panicy month! Costly? Each block can hold about 2500 transactions. If you split a single bitcoin into 1 satoshi transactions, it would fill up every block for the next 4.6 months. So no, 1 satoshi as a minimum fee wouldn't work. Tom was slow in processing refunds, and he was given the Scammer tag. BFL is no better. They are both scams. Bitcoin doesn't do "encryption". I just love how he criticizes other people's estimates, when every single estimate he's ever given has been missed by 1000% or more. It'll take an Avalon about 2 months to break even at that price at the current difficulty. Sounds like a fair price. I'd like to think I'm not the only miner who is concerned about the security of the blockchain. BFL has tied up millions of dollars for many months that could have been better spent securing the network. Their fake ship dates were also anti-competitive and more than one other project didn't move forward due to BFL's lies. Fortunately Avalon ignored BFL's lies and went ahead with their project. No trolling. Bitsyncom is welcome to come prove me wrong. I can look over the dozens of ignored PMs, emails, and support tickets. All he has to do is provide a tracking number. I give him full permission to post the tracking number so everyone can see if it is shipped and/or delivered. That is the address you can send your payment to me. If I provide proof of payment (the address I sent my payment to Avalon) do you then accept my terms? Sure, send the 32 BTC to 1JK3Kz6MpuTZ7NKRtVejJhcHCtPtuJAJ1G, then as soon as I receive my Avalons I will tell you I shipped 1 to you. Then for the next 2 months I will ignore all emails and messages from you and you'll never receive a tracking number. At some point in the future you may or may not receive the unit. Since that's clearly not a scam by your own definition, do we have a deal?That leaves me with 2 more Batch-1 Avalons. Anyone else want one under those same conditions? Tom paid out some refunds, and still received a scammer tag. Failing to deliver a paid-for product to a single person is worthy of the scammer tag.Look at my order number. Look at all the others received. Avalon is squarely in the scam category for me since there is no proof of my order being shipped. I couldn't care less how many others have been received. I have not received mine.Sure, it's 2 months late, at $1000 per day. The price for my 3 Avalons is $60,000, or 1280 BTC if you prefer. Bitsyncom,Where is my package? Order #200000112.I think it's time to start tagging Bitsyncom with the scammer tag if he can't produce tracking numbers. It's been 2 months since they "shipped". Bitsyncom,This is why you need to get to work and send out tracking numbers. People with later order numbers are receiving their units before earlier orders. Send out the tracking numbers to everyone, like you promised. BFL has been "about to ship" for 5 months. Seems the pre-order funds are running low. Gotta stop the refunds asap. Yup.

And it will still get faster as more optimizations are finished.
Right. Tracking numbers are very important, and they were promised. Furthermore, if there is any mistake, the sooner the tracking number is provided, the sooner mistakes can be corrected. BitSyncom,Why is it so hard to send out the tracking numbers? Which orders have been shipped? Does anyone have tracking numbers? What, you don't believe Josh? He's promised to finish shipping all preorders in under 2 months.http://forums.butterflylabs.com/pre-sales-questions/1084-if-i-order-now-when-will-i-get-my-order.html That's how BFL strings people along with fake schedules.https://forums.butterflylabs.com/announcements/692-bfl-asic-status.html#post13172Don't you love the "probably less" thrown in there just to give people hope when there's no way in hell it'll ever happen. It would be like a casino handing a stack of chips to an employee to go play at the casino so that the casino doesn't appear empty. Whether they win or lose, the employee hands whatever chips he has left back to the casino. The only cost to inflate the activity graphs would be the transaction fee, a minimal .0005 BTC at this time.There is no way to tell if there is an insider placing SD bets. Bring back the .01 minimum fee. Problem solved. I just want to say, Wow! With the new client and 0.8 servers, I'm doing a full blockchain download on my phone in about an hour. Dead puppies aren't much fun. Fortunately you're in good company. He is ignoring hundreds of customers equally. Monthly fees may apply, identify verification may apply, bank account required, limited to a few countries. You can't compare Bitcoin transfers with SEPAs. I do not think you know the meaning of that word. There are numerous reasons the block size is constrained.The default fee is about US$.02. International wires cost about $50 and take days to process. Yes, $.02 isn't enough for a international currency transfer averaging 10 minutes. Increase the default fee from BTC .0005 to BTC .01 and the blocks will have plenty of room for everyone's transactions. Exactly. If you want your transactions processed quickly, attach a nice healthy fee with them. If you can't be bothered to include a decent fee then your transaction deserves to be left behind. It is very good. Now people will start including larger fees with their transactions. Don't bother with Haiku. It is a lousy counterfeit of BeOS. Then stop picking random orders to refund. Either refund them based on when the refund was requested, or by order number. Anything else is dishonest. Josh is on record predicting earlier deliveries. He knows they can't reach that date, but he'll leave that up for customers as long as possible so they don't request refunds. Eventually he'll push it back.https://forums.butterflylabs.com/pre-sales-questions/1084-if-i-order-now-when-will-i-get-my-order.html Just installed 2.42, still crashes. I'll send in another crash report. My app crashes when trying to import a private key. Is this the same issue? Where are today's refunds?
Not a chance in the world that they will not only start shipping, but also completely clear their current backlog of orders by the end of April. That's already being done. Bitcoin miners do not compute a complete SHA256 hash. There are several minor shortcuts already implemented in modern miners. I hesitate to call SatoshiDICE spam or dust, but the vast majority of those transactions are small transfers going back and forth between the same 2 addresses. It would be a very bad idea if we created a hard fork just so people could transfer one BTC back and forth constantly. 12 Feb 2013: The chips have been delivered by FedEx to the bumping facility.27 Feb 2013: A photo was taken of the chips.15 days to take a photograph, and you call that progress? It's going to be a very long time before power costs become an issue. GPUs are still quite profitable. What matters now is initial cost and time to delivery. What are 18 employees doing? They haven't had product to work on in months. S.Dice is essentially micro-transactions. Increasing the block size to support micro-transactions is absolutely the wrong idea. Bitcoin cannot be built around micro-transactions. All it takes is a little honest communication. People know their order numbers. If you are distributing refunds based on order numbers, then let everyone what where you are in the refund list. That way peoples expectations can be reasonable. Ok, let's go with 9.6 tps. That means roughly 25,000,000 transactions per month. If Bitcoin becomes a payment backbone where users transactions are reconciled monthly, the current blocksize limit supports 25 million users. I strongly dislike hard forks, so until we have several million users, the blocksize needs to be left alone.  Bump. What's going on BitSyncom? New ETA is end of 2013. LOL. True, but a very short-sighted view. A day or two of mining will pay back any extra carrier charges. Hell, I'd fly to China and bring it back myself and come out ahead. More crystal ball predictions (my apologies to the real psychics of the world):13 days and counting... You did. You dropped the ball. Stop blaming everyone else. I know it's a lot of work taking in all that pre-order money for batch #2, but there's only 3 days left in February, the date you promised to complete shipping by. Don't you think batch #1 customers are due an update on shipping? It's also a lie. Every step of the way, every other company they work with is always the one that won't meet promised schedules. Sooner or later Josh looses all credibility. You can't believe anything he says about dates, because he's just making them up as he goes along. 2 days in bumping becomes 2 weeks. Why? Because that 2-day schedule was all in his mind. No, the problem is the dates he gives are what he calls worst-case scenarios, when they really are impossibly best-case scenarios. "Honest Abe! The schedule is already padded. There's no way we'll miss the dates this time." BS From day 1 they said they'd ship in February. It's still February, so hardly surprising. Unlike another company that is coming up on 4 months late and counting. What shipping method is being used for most of Batch #1? That just makes no sense. You don't just do a run of 8 chips. And even if you are crazy enough to produce just 8 chips, if you burn them all out, then there's no point in running thermal simulations. You already proved they can't handle the heat.
If you had actual working chips, you wouldn't have needed to run "simulations" on thermal propagation, you would have tested the *actual* thermal propagation. Not working chips, that's for sure. But don't take my word for it. Here's what Josh had to say:When BFL really does have a working chip, you'll hear about it. They never had chips. They came to those conclusions based on simulations. What website are you looking at? Clicking through the ad goes to http://butterflylabs.com/products?s1 and lets you checkout without ever mentioning the pre-order status. That's no giant "PRE-ORDER NOW" button. That's a giant ORDER NOW button. Do you think you'll be able to ship more than 2 units this time? It's even more than that. Whatever source was used to create the binaries, that's the source that needs to be made available. There's no cleanup to do! In fact, doing some sort of cleanup would be in violation of the GPL, as then the sources wouldn't match the binaries they already shipped. Of course he's defending them. He's earning $270 profit per day because Avalon shipped only him an ASIC unit and he can rake in the bitcoins before the difficulty adjusts. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theoryIf the scams go unpunished, more scams will result.If license violations go unpunished, more license violations will result."playing nice" just encourages more people to break the law/license/etc. Playing nice has worked so well in the past:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=83794.0 That's not for you to chose. You are in violation of the GPL. You shipped binaries, now deliver the source code. There is nothing to organize. Are you actually complaining about the GPL license? kjj is absolutely correct. Avalon took GPL source, modified it, and failed to offer the source. That is a violation, plain and simple. It doesn't matter if they promised to release it later. It doesn't matter if they are giving up trade secrets to release it. If they don't like the terms of the GPL, they shouldn't have used GPL source. But they did use GPL source, and they have violated the license. Actually, no. Unless they included the source code (they didn't), or included a written offer on how to obtain the source code (I've seen no reports of such), then they are already in violation. Let me quote their own announcement:Yes, they shipped binaries 20 days ago, and have yet to release the source code for it. That is in clear violation of the license.Furthermore, they are well aware that they are in violation of the license, yet they are chosing not to comply. It would be so much easier if companies would just release the source when they release binaries.Bitsyncom, post the source. Now. Those all appear to be software-related issues. You know, the kind of issues BFL hasn't run into yet because they don't have working chips to start developing the software for yet. Avalon has working chips, BFL doesn't. Plain and simple. That device has already paid for itself. Now he's making over $200 profit every single day. I'd be quite happy with that situation. How about you talk with Tom and find out why the BTC refunds haven't been processed? You were part of the project when the refunds were first requested, and you definitely have communication with Tom at this point. Find out the status of the BTC refunds. That's great you shipped to 2 high-profile users. When are the rest of the Batch #1 customers going to receive their units?
The revised plan is CC first, then if the funds last, some of the BTC orders may be refunded. BTC refunds were requested long before the "cc first" plan was ever devised, yet they weren't processed. Why? People have been requesting BTC refunds for weeks, and none have received it. I don't see this batch selling well.* It's no longer price-competitive. Batch #2 should cost less to produce.* Customer service has been horrible for Batch #1.* Too long until scheduled shipping.* No refunds. How does that work? Show me how to decrypt a SHA256 hash back to its original contents. Profit per day at 66 GH/s @ 400w = $190Profit per day at 60 GH/s @ 100w = $174Hashing monster > vaporware product. So? Mining doesn't do any cryptography. And what happens when the funds run out? Do CC refunds first and the BTC refunds never get done. Refund the BTC first and when the CC funds run out, customers can still do chargebacks and get their refunds that way. The only fair way is to refund BTC first. Dave, the CC customers have nothing to lose. Refund them last.Unless you are personally guaranteeing that every customer will be refunded in full, do the BTC refunds first. Irrelevant.If Avalon distributes binaries, they are under obligation to provide the corresponding source code. It's very clear and simple. Then later, they can change the source and provide new binaries for the next batch. This is the key point. Refunding CC charges is no big deal. Those people can always chargeback. Tom/Dave's #1 priority needs to be BTC refunds. Nothing else matters. No, it's not. Lots of servers draw 400w in a 1U case. 4U cases can handle well over 1000w, easily. Huh? They've been quoting 400 watts. Who has trouble cooling a 4U case pulling 400 watts? Since BFL does not actually have a product to sell, any and all BFL-related threads should be moved to a more appropriate forum:Off-topicor maybe:Gambling Cancellations have taken their toll. BFL is only ordering 10,000 chips, so well under 75 TH/s is due to be shipped in the first batch. Let me get this straight. You're going to stick with BFL, who has already delayed from October to November to December to January to February and has yet to show a working device. And you think Avalon stinks, who moved their shipping date up from February to January? You are seriously confused. #3 We promised "Week of February 10th", but we didn't specify which year. Anyone who thinks BFL is going to meet the currently published timeline. Your example is some vague recollection of some post on some random forum? Why is it so hard to find the real people that run BFL? What are they trying to hide?I'm just lazy. Too much work to narrow down the list to just engineers. I found so many people that work there. Machinists, painters, inspectors, supervisors, welders, cnc operators, etc.Tim Bishop, Engineer, http://www.facebook.com/tim.bishop.3914Rossford Fayen, Engineer, http://www.facebook.com/rossford.fayen Great example. Check out their web page some time.http://www.nsaindustries.com/about-nsa/management-team/Notice how the management team isn't trying to hide their identities? Show me BFL's management team. It's quite logical. They've shown no demo, therefore they've never build a prototype. Since there was no prototype, they never had actual chips. Their latest update is all about how the simulations in December showed barely acceptable limits. Hence, they're still at phase-1, "Simulate". The odds of them shipping final products "Week of February 10th" is virtually nil.
That's quite a mischaracterization of his position. Sonny is a "high-level executive" and a company owner. https://forums.butterflylabs.com/bfl-forum-miscellaneous/690-13-jan-2013-asic-update-discussion-thread-8.html#post10450First batch has been slashed to 10k chips. Sounds like refunds are adding up. First it was 20k, then up to 100k chips. Now it's down to only 10k chips. Purchasing ASICs would be fine, except there are no ASICs to be purchased. Only pre-orders with vague dates/specs/etc. Ask yourself this question. If they received a small batch, wouldn't they put a single chip on a PCB? How would a single chip overheat? Why wouldn't they demo such a working ASIC? Something just doesn't add up. Sure:http://www.psitechnologies.com/products/powerqfn5x6.php7 watts in a 5x6 mm package. 6.4w per chip should not be a problem. As usual, they're not telling the truth. When Avalon is 4 months past their initial delivery date (Feb '13), then you can say that. Until then, shut up. Did you read the first post?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=120184.msg1294416#msg1294416 If that were true, they would have working sample chips and be able to demo them. No demo, therefore no chips, therefore they are still just spewing lies. Nice trolling.Avalon facts are this:http://forum.bitsyn.com/viewtopic.php?id=5Their initial shipping date was February. The fact that they are slipping on their early delivery is nothing like BFL:October missedNovember missedDecember missedJanuary missedFebruary still to be missed tl;dr update:October missedNovember missedDecember missedJanuary missedFebruary maybe Nobody wants a big long complicated update. They just want one word and one number. Let me help you.Pick one word from this list:JanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecemberPick one number from this list:12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031 Just how do you think Sonny is able to tell his parole office he is going to be investing in a startup, when his "finances had dwindled to zero" and "does not have the ability to pay a fine"? Possible, but extremely unlikely. BFL is anything but a "large company". It is a privately owned small company. Sonny is a "high-level executive" and company owner. The odds of him having no control is about the same as finding a Bitcoin block with a cpu-miner. Don't let the fact get in the way of your guessing.http://codinginmysleep.com/interview-with-sonny-vleisides/An "upper-level executive" would definitely be involved directly.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=110868.0Clearly he is directly involved. He's even an owner, just not a "majority" owner. No one has more control over the company than it's owners. ROFL. Another quality BFL update.See Tom, this is how you string people along for month after month after month after month... It's a pity that Tom didn't learn from the experts in announcing delays. You don't go and announce 2 months delays and vague ownership changes, it scares everyone off. You announce, relax, don't worry, it'll be soon, more info coming, free tablet with purchase, check out these flashy lights, yadda yadda yadda. That way 4+ months delays are more easily swallowed. If they really did have chips produced, where are they? Someone should go dumpster-diving. They claimed to have sent something to the FCC for certification, so that must have been their only working prototype. Or else they lied about the FCC. Who knows?
BFL is demoing their old FGPA miners. They have no working ASICs. I'm curious. How is the 80% tax any different than a pre-mine? In the end, the "foundation" get a butt-load of coins. They either lied, or are incompetent. Take your pick. They claimed, in Oct, that they could still meet the Oct date. Not only did they miss Oct, they missed Nov, and Dec, and they're still not done missing dates. There was no way they could have met the claimed Oct date. Fraud is rampant across all payment methods, particularly internet-related ones like credit cards. Bitcoin is the only safe one. You can accept Bitcoins from any customer from anywhere in the world, and never have to worry about fraud. Sure, as soon as BFL releases the Single bitstream. Which is nothing more than a red herring meant to denigrate his competitors. The Avalon team has not violated GPL licenses in the past, and there is no evidence that they are going to start doing so. What are people going to do when BFL declares bankrupcy after having spent all the pre-order funds? Nada. There's nothing they can do realistically. What "China" does is irrelevent. The Avalon team has a known history of releasing Open Source stuff. That's what matters. Congrats to BFL for missing a 3rd month and delivering nothing. My biggest complaint about p2pool is the maintenance required to keep a p2pool node up and running. That said, the advantages to p2pool are enough to keep me on it. It's just so fun to watch Inaba fly off the handle. It is so fascinating that BFL keeps him employed. I see nothing referring to changing die size. It's pretty clear. Once they stop manufacturing that model, all warranties revert to a 1 year warranty. It really is just a 1 year warranty. Avalon's initial ship date was "we will have all of the 300 units shipped before the end of February, 2013." By my calendar, that hasn't passed yet, so they have yet to have a shipping delay. So how has bASIC "all but run off" with the money? Is there any refund that hasn't been given? Is there any evidence whatsoever to claim "all but run off"? Or was it a flat out lie? Interesting. Where did you find any evidence of bASIC running off with money? Or was that another flat out Inaba lie? Since when is the size of your office space Top Secret information? When they claim "lifetime" they actually mean as long as they sell the product. Once they stop selling it, all the warranties end. That was the general thinking, maybe 20 years ago. General cryptography has advanced sufficiently enough in recent years that no computer, ever, will be fast enough to crack them. Let me quote a real expert: Double-spends have always been possible. That's why we count "confirmations". The number of confirmations reduces the risk of double-spends. Actually, no. You or I are somewhat impartial. Inaba is a competitor. Any information he might put forth is extremely biased and anti-useful.
Inaba has no idea whatsoever how Avalon is doing things, so he has no useful info to add to the thread, therefore he's just trolling as usual. Providing advertising for a company is a form of consideration. Requiring some form of consideration for a sweepstakes turns it into an illegal lottery. Doesn't matter if anyone else is doing it. BFL is running an illegal lottery. No surprise, really, having been founded by a felon convicted of running an illegal scheme. By requiring consideration, in the form of advertising by the participants, and not having a "no purchase necessary" way to enter the contest, they are in clear violation of the law. You need to keep it simple for Inaba.Typical BFLisms. Never say anything definitive, so can never be called lying. By saying "can replace", he can weasel out of any statement of his responsibilities. That's what they want you to think. They know they can string you along with ship dates that are just around the corner.Early Oct: "We'll ship this month."Late Oct: "We'll have chips and ship next month."Nov: "We'll have chips and ship next month."Dec: "We'll have chips and ship next month." Without working chips, they were never close to shipping. That's not how they portrayed things:They made it sound like there was no way they'd miss Oct. Let's see what BFL_Josh really said:https://forums.butterflylabs.com/pre-sales-questions/104-shipping-2-3-weeks-2.html#post1461That post is from Oct! Oct was never portrayed as a best-case scenario. It was always portrayed as an almost sure thing. Read the actual quotes again. Even in Oct they claimed they were "on time", which by now should be clear was a flat out lie. They're still not close to finishing even after months have passed. And if you paid 200 AUD for something, and later got a refund and only received 100 AUD, that would suck, wouldn't it? Not when refunds come into play. Someone who paid in BTC for a pre-order 6 months ago for 200 BTC, if they get a refund now they'll only get 100 BTC back. Ouch! Just because BFL didn't receive the coins, doesn't mean people didn't pay in BTC. So how many BTC did you lose? They were told they couldn't do it that fast. They bragged about how expert they were. Then setbacks, and more setbacks, and then more setbacks. Sooner or later you have to conclude they are either grossly incompetent (which means their "expert" status was a lie), or just flat out lying about their dates. Take your pick. There you go again. Predicting the future. You can't even predict your own future (Ship in Oct, ship in Nov, ship in Dec, ship in Jan, ...), what makes you think you can predict other companies futures? BFL sure likes to blame the fab since being unknown they can't come here and defend themselves.The conversation probably went like this:BFL: We want to do a fully custom ASIC.Fab: Have you ever done ASICs before?BFL: Sure, we programmed FPGAs. That's the same thing, right?Fab: Uh, no. Very different.BFL: Well, how long will it take?Fab: Someone with experience can do it in 6 months, but since this is your first attempt, expect 1-2 years.BFL: Ok, great, thanks.BFL to public: We'll have a finished product in 6 months, guaranteed! The fab said so. Sure, they're *currently* giving refunds. But as stated by Josh, the official policy stands, and is CYA, so they can stop refunding orders at any time they feel like it. Statements made by random staff members is hardly binding. It doesn't matter what most employees say. Only someone with real authority to enact policy can make binding statements. Since Josh spends all his time trolling forums, I doubt he has any authority.Secondary reason is many customers do not read the forums, and so their only information is that refunds are not available. Having conflicting information publicly posted is lying to customers, something BFL loves to do. This is BFL's first ASIC. Any fab that does 65nm has done thousands of runs of ASICs. BFL's lack of experience is the true cause of the delays. Not the fab. For someone who won't "predict the future" regarding his own company's policy, you sure do love to predict the future of your competitors:Congrats on yet another delay. Stop with the CYA and make the refund policy official and put it on the website. You owe it to your "customers". Pirateat40 did a pretty good job of paying out at first too. How well did that turn out? How about mybitcoin.com? etc. Every delay has more and more people asking for refunds. BFL will stop sending refunds. Make no mistake about it. The even say so on their website.And then it's too late. Game over. Sonny moves off to another country with another $19,000,000 in his back pocket. Why? Because the official website says they're not refundable.http://www.butterflylabs.com/faq/As a member of the Bitcoin community, I'm concerned that BFL will stop giving refunds because that's their official policy.
Well then go find someone that can explain it to you. There's got to be at least one of those 22 employees that can explain a basic refund policy. How about the soldering lady? You have no chips, so she's got nothing to solder. She'd probably love the chance to actually do something. Yes, we get it, you love to rant on and on without answering questions. Stick on topic. Which refund requests are non-refundable? Ask your boss, he can probably explain it to you. Given your past ability to predict the future (Oct ship date missed, Nov ship date missed, Dec ship date to be missed), I have zero confidence in your ability to predict the future.I know you like to fly off the handle ranting, and it does provide a good deal of entertainment here, but I'm asking you very simple direct questions. I will keep rephrasing it until you understand. I am asking for you to clarity company policy. Real businesses have a clearly stated return policy. What refund requests will or will not be honored?Let's take a look at how this looks on a website for a real company:http://store.apple.com/us/help/returns_refundSee how nice and clear that is? I can go buy an Apple product, and they correctly "predict the future" up to 14 day ahead I can return that product.Let's look at BFL's again:http://www.butterflylabs.com/faq/That's pretty clear. That's not just a typo. Read it again. nonÂ·reÂ·fundÂ·able. What refund requests will not be honored?Maybe you can track down someone with actual company authority to clarify the policy. Is Sonny still around, or has he skipped the country again? You are referring to a past event, not a policy that extends into the future. "We always have." is strictly a past event. What about the future? Will every refund request be honored in the future? I'll keep things simple for you. Can BFL refuse a refund request? Yes or no. There's no "A)". The authority is the official company website. "B)" is simply a rude grunt employee unable to enforce or enact policy. Just cuz he might scrub their toilets once a week doesn't mean he determines company policy. He doesn't even post under his offical company account here. Official BFL Policy is clearly visible on the website and has been that way for 6 months. If the website was intended to be updated, it would have been updated months ago. BFL can refuse any request for a refund. Stop spreading mis-information. Let me show you the official BFL policy.http://www.butterflylabs.com/faq/ That won't help. No matter how many BTC you sent them, you'll get 100 BTC back today if you cancel. Early pre-order people are screwed. Oh, but you did. If you bought a Single, you spent rougly 200 BTC for a place in line, and when BFL starts shipping, they'll go through all pre-orders pretty quick. Someone ordering today will get their rig at nearly the same time, but it'll only cost them 100 BTC. BFL suckered you into giving them an extra 100 BTC for nothing. Of course there's a loophole.

Take your pick. The next scheduled announcement of another "unexpected delay" from the world's most experienced processor design team in the world! Then what do you make of this official quote?So they might get the chips this year. You think they just plug the chips in and that's a finished product immediately ready to ship? Admit it. There is zero chance of BFL shipping an ASIC in 2012. It has now been more than a month. Who is the test lab? What was the result? How many times do they need to break a promise before it is considered to be lying? Hundreds of customers over many months were promised products "in 6-8 weeks", and none of them got it when promised. They have a clear history of distorting and stretching the truth. To me that indicates a strong likelyhood that anything not verifiable is likely a lie from them.Think they still might make that "late November" date? Since they don't specify the year, I guess they mean 2013 so they're not lying, right? See how you have to bend over backwards to believe their claims. They're the one making claims that no one can verify.How did you know I just bought a Ferrari? I'm installing it in my garage right now.https://i.imgur.com/dIlxd.jpgcreativex has another opportunity for me, so things are looking very bright for my retirement. I expect them to tell the truth.They were not "highly experienced", they're working on their first ASIC and finding out ASIC design isn't as easy as FPGA routing.They were not "a market leader in microprocessor design", they are FPGA programmers.They had no real hope of "shipments for October", they just wanted you to think that so you wouldn't buy from someone else.They were not "installing high-speed equipment", they were simply bidding on ebay for such hardware.They don't have "venture capital funding", they just have $19 million stolen from customers in a mail fraud scheme and a lot of customer pre-order funds.I'm scheduling to retire with $10 million in the bank next week. Do you believe that? Let's look at their actual statements, not your opinions:They gave every impression that they'd really really be shipping in October. October came and went. November came and went. December is going to come and go, and you'll keep making excuses for them. Get ready for the yearly BFL Chinese New Year excuse for more delays. They have every reason to lie. As long as no other ASICs are shipping, they will keep stringing you along with "real soon now" so that they keep your money. One of their company owners is a convicted felon. Their lies have been quite successful. They've tied up customer funds for 6 months. They claim to be "venture funded", but refuse to publish who the venture capitalist is so that you can't prove they're lying about it. And on and on and on.
And I'll switch my bASIC and Avalon orders to BFL orders if Josh is fired. After all the claims about padding the schedule so that you'd ship in October and how you wouldn't make the same mistake you made with FPGAs, you want to come here to brag about only being 2 months late? You really should stick to your company forums where you can ban people who spread the truth about you.Why are you so obsessed with Tom? Can you explain the facts behind these quotes? Why does Tom scare you so much? Are you worried that even with his delays he'll ship before you? You already have a chip with near 100% success and you postponed release so you could get even better than near 100% success? Right. Of course BFL has a date from the Fab. The fact that they won't admit it just means that it's so far in the future that a bunch of people would cancel their orders. It's all about stringing people along so that they don't cancel their orders. Increasing the clock speed is the surest way to lose their power efficency advantage. Heat PumpYou get 3-4 times as much heat compared to simply using a plain heater/GPU. I worked with a programmer like that once. Deadline would be on Friday. As the week progressed, he'd be all "yeah, I'll be done on Friday". Then on Friday, "oh, sorry, not done. It's going to take 4-6 more weeks". Let's just say he wasn't very skilled. First batch was quoted to be 20,000 ASICs. Sounds like it's going to take quite a while to turn those all into products. Batch #1 is going to last for months. Price in Jul: $6/btcPrice in Nov: $12/btcHad you invested by buying BTC instead of giving BFL a loan, you would have doubled your money. BFL thanks you greatly for the huge interest-free loan. So what you're saying is, when you flip a coin less than 350 times a day you get 50/50, but when you flip it more than 350 times in a day you get 60/40? Claim it all you want, it makes no sense.Let's look at this week day by day (which is a bad idea as there's too much variation). 2 blocks or less is below expected, 3 blocks or more is above average.1-day ago. 2 - Below2-days ago. 3 - Above3-days ago. 4 - Above4-days ago. 4 - Above5-days ago. 4 - Above6-days ago. 1 - Below7-days ago. 0 - Below4 days above average, 3 days below average. Where's the problem???Go for it. Take a serious look.https://github.com/forrestv/p2poolAnd when ASICs hit you'll see that you're imagining patterns where there are none. That's just ridiculous. Take a look at the last week. Hashrate has been climing to over 400 GH/s, and the 7-day average is still over 115%. Let's look at what BFL said, and not what you wanted them to have said.Emphasis added to make it easier for you. The odds of having a 6-block day, when the hashrate is high, is quite low and simply due to variance. Not finding one isn't going to prove anything. Our 90-day moving average is over 110% of expected payout. That's impressive. SudoGhost is simply a coward. He hides behind the "reliable sources" and refuses to allow any intelligent discussion take place. Yes, because we all know that taking $19,000,000 from little old ladies is simply just the way a fine upstanding citizen makes a living. Right.BFL: 20,000 chips in the first batch, maybe half of them go into Jalapenos for 4.5 GH/s and half into the other for 7.5 GH/s. We're looking at 120 TH/s preordered if they use every chip.bASIC: 900 orders, also assume a 50/50 split between the 27 and 54 GH/s rigs. 36.45 TH/s total preordered.BFL has roughly 3x the orders TH/s-wise as bASIC. Code:Shares: 1895 (123 orphan, 55 dead) Stale rate: ~9.4% (8-11%) Efficiency: ~99.2% (97-101%) Yours looks about the same as mine. I sure like this prediction:
Use the export feature to get the existing key file. Decrypt it. Add your private key to the file. Encrypt it. Use the import feature.Read the README for how to decrypt it:http://code.google.com/p/bitcoin-wallet/source/browse/wallet/README The creators of the chain would get quite an education if they had to deal with real-world attacks. Sure, send 1btc to 1MYJN88qvUxuHdyuHs8z2KuF7FL3HYKdmK and I'll vote for your miner. Because with difficulty increasing, increased performance now will find more shares than longer life. Some people know. But there are plenty of other readers of this forum which are not aware. You don't list it in your sig. You don't list it in your profile. You don't even post as BFL_Josh any more. In the past month you've posted roughly 250 posts as Inaba, and 0 as BFL_Josh.You're doing it right now by not using your BFL account. You're hoping some people won't notice the BFL affiliation. And you're right. Some people don't know. Then what are you? You are employed by BFL, yet your sig and user profile are conspicuously absent of any mention of your employer. Yet here you are again, defending, and even speaking for BFL. If you're not going to post as BFL_Josh, then you're nothing more than a shill yourself, which makes your statement above false. If I'm reading the date stamps correct, Satoshi only mined about 14 blocks before announcing the release of the software. Definitely not "tens of thousands". Ah, gotcha. You're just making things up, like that 7x performance increase and the 2 months prior shipping date. I guess the reality is Avalon is faster and will ship sooner. Thanks for clearing that up. I suggest you read up on the definition of Orders of magnitude I couldn't care less about FCC approval, and that even goes for BFL hardware. These are not consumer products, and I don't expect the manufacturers to be wasting money on expensive certifications. How'd you do that so fast? I've heard it takes 14 days to update notices on websites. Yup, working as intended. No one is forced to include any transactions they don't want. Time stamps are slightly flexible, by design. Competition is a wonderful thing. Thank you for bringing it. So early adapters that helped make the coin successful were rewarded. Sounds fair to me.So your incentive to start mining is that you get the same reward as someone who comes along later, after the coin is successful?Your design isn't fair. It's anti early adapter. Wow, that's the most annoying sig I've seen. Welcome to /ignore. What a great idea! I guess that's what happens when you actually have experience in the field. Loving the key import feature. Now I have my mobile privkey backed up, and I don't have to worry about losing it. Is the answer 42? Looks like nice steady growth. Mining is profitable, so miners are increasing capacity and new miners are coming on board. The details show:Up to 500 mA power, all portsInput: 100 - 240 V, 50/60 Hz; 1.6A, maximum So I think it will be fine.
Their official policy is pretty clear:So far, few people have been requesting refunds. That's going to change as more and more delays happen. Like you said, not a big deal if the estimated hashrate is off by .045%, since with variance the estimate is going to be all over the place anyhow.That's the key. As long as work isn't lost, it's a non-issue. MondoHub looks perfect.http://www.manhattan-products.com/en-US/products/9583-mondohubFill that puppy up with ASICs. I'd just like to be clear, Bitcoin will not be affected by any storm. Maybe some other related services, but Bitcoin itself is too distributed to be affected by something so small as a hurricane. 6 weeks you say? I expect a public apology from BFL for not shipping when they said they would. More likely though Inaba will slink off and hope people forget what a complete ass he's been. Here's your answer: Yes. That is the address they have been using, and it has the owner's name on the building. A 60 GH/s rig would find a share in just under 1 minute. I find it hard to believe that it will cause anyone any problems. Oh, they're getting stored in a simple flat file. Well that's easy, download blocks from random peers and store them in temporary files. Then when the next block needed has been downloaded, copy it to the final block file. Now that October is almost over, are you polishing an apology of your own for promising October shipments and failing to meet it? Risk. Mining may or may not turn out to be profitable. Selling the hardware the risk is minimal, especially when you can get customers to pre-order for months in advance while you sit on the money and have nothing to ship them. Graph goes up. Graph goes down. It's called "variance".http://bitcoin.sipa.be/growth-10k.pngNothing unusual. Yet. And even if you did wait for a prototype, you still have a big wait if you order now: Who's this "we"? Are you speaking for BFL? If so, why are you posting under a personal account? "Butterfly Labs (BF Labs Inc.), a market leader in microprocessor design". LOL. It has nothing to do with security. It has everything to do with being embarassed about your office. Have you seen it? Would you buy expensive computer equipment from a place like that? What would be a issue, say for a 54 GH/s miner on today's regular p2pool/bitcoind? Quite true. There's a lot of overhead to running a mining operation. Uptime, installing new releases, always on Internet connection, etc. Mining isn't for everyone. You don't see everyone who owns gold also running a gold mining operation. Bitcoin users don't need to mine.It will strength the security of the network. Professional miners will be more diligent in keeping their systems up-to-date and running optimally. That is what keeps the network healthy. Not amateur miners. You do realize that p2pool isn't the only pool to distribute blocks directly to miners?A virtual impossibility. That'll depend on how the ASIC is designed. If it is designed like the current BFL Single, then it will be a poor p2pool miner. I doubt bASIC and Avalon will have that problem.
So take price out of the equation. A slightly better way to estimate future returns is on BTC output verses BTC cost today.Today's price of $12/btc, $1299 = 108 BTC for an Avalon ASIC.66 GH/s, 12.5 btc/block rewardThat leaves only 1 variable, network difficulty. ASIC pre-orders are going to hit 10x pretty quickly, beyond that it'll probably taper off.10x network difficulty = 1.08 btc/day100 days to recover spent coins. Funny how that turned out to be a nice round number. It's...um...a space heater. It's cold in my office. Leave it at work. Free power!  Wow, I had no idea Sonny was so harrassed by the evil government. I've started a charity fund for him. Donate what you can to 15buHwfhJaAnrJAgdQGrr38abXJvWZnQA6. I'll see that all the donated funds, minus a small management fee, make their way to Sonny. You seem to be equating the success of bitcoin with the number of human beings using mining equipment. I'd say there's an optimal number somewhere, maybe a few thousand people, that are needed to keep the diversity of mining healthy. Too few people and you risk one set of problems. Too many people and you have another set of problems. But the primary reason for mining is to secure the network. ASICs will bring much increased security to the blockchain, as long as there's enough of them. And by all accounts, there are plenty of people pre-ordering ASICs, so there's nothing to worry about. Not everyone that uses bitcoin needs to be a miner. In fact, we don't want everyone to be a miner. There is much overhead with being a miner. It's not appropriate for everyone. That would be stretching the truth, but then, they've got plenty of experience in that. I do a lot of international shipping, and often use DHL. DHL does a pretty good job of getting things delivered quickly. I'd be more than happy to answer your question, just not in Tom's thread.You interact on behalf of BFL every day while posting as "Inaba". Take for instance the following lie:"We" obvously means you are speaking for BFL. Since the website clearly states "Payments made for pre-orders of ASIC based products now under development should be considered non-refundable", "at any time" is false because you can refuse to refund an order for any reason you like.Now this one's a whopper:405 w @ 54 GH/s = GPUs? You're off by 2 orders of magnitude!Is the bet on? Nope? You declined the bet.No, actually, when you start mining and how much you pay for hardware are crucial elements in profitability.Since you don't know what the exchange rate will be, or what the difficulty will be, you cannot state it would never see positive ROI. Neither can you state at 150w it would take years.Let me just end with one more:That's just the last few pages of your posts. So your policy is that you'll refuse refunds whenever you feel like it. Quality policy you have there. If that is truly your policy, why does your website state otherwise? Excellent work. Does this require downloading and re-processing the blockchain from the beginning? I just had to quote this. You said it far better than I could have. TouchÃ©! Since you represent BFL on this forum and are an executive officer of BFL, "you" obviously means "BFL". Typical red herring of yours. Bitcoin, by design, makes it impossible to accurately determine which addresses belong to any given wallet. Therefore, this "analysis" of hoarded coins, etc. will always be significantly flawed. This description sounds pretty good. Makes sense.Even for someone starting from block 0?That sounds quite un-optimal.We could update the Bitcoin client to grab blocks from multiple peers, right? With a few more patches, downloading the chain from peers should approach the speed of a torrent. Most definitely, YES! Difficulty isn't a means to make money. It is a means to provide security. When the difficulty skyrockets, the security of the blockchain also skyrockets. That isn't just a good thing. It is a crucial requirement for the health of the blockchain. You're lucky. Their official policy is pre-orders are "non-refundable". Where do you get that crack you're smoking? I need to get me some of that if you think 400w @ 54 GH/s is GPU-land.Since you like calling Tom a liar, let's quote some of your lies.ROFL. You lied about when they'd ship. This lie went on for months.ROFLMAO. You lied about performance and power usage.The trifecta of lies. You lied about performance, power usage, and shipping date. Good job.
http://www.butterflylabs.com/faq/With no refunds till January, sounds like they're confident they'll ship in late December. Then how is this different than connecting to high-speed bitcoin peers? Ah, yes, I had the difficulty unadjusted.$16.32/day income, $3.6/day electricity. 22% is a far extreme estimate.bASIC isn't going to run 500 watts. Extremeley few miners run at $.30/kwh. The normal case will be far better, more like 5% spent on electricity. Insignificant.What's going to matter is time to start and cost to start. Not power costs. From 22TH to 144TH is a 6.5x increase. Feel free to run the electricity numbers for a 6.5x increase. They're still insignificant for ASICs.Ah hell, I'll run it myself.54 GH/s @ $12/btc (after halving) = $106/dayForgive me Tom for a crazy estimate. Let's assume an outrageous 500 watts for a bASIC at insane California rates.500 watts @ $.30/kwh = $3.6/daySignificant? I don't think so. The current network is rougly 350 60GH rigs. For the energy costs to skyrocket, we'd have to see 35,000 new 60GH rigs come online! That ain't gonna happen in the immediate future. Energy costs are a distant 3rd priority, behind date of mining start and initial costs. By the time it does matter, next generation ASICs will take over. Exactly. So why is BFL trying to go down that path? Why not let the pros do it? I think a three-year lifespan for this first generation of ASICs is way too long. I would count on 1 year on average, 2 years at the longest. Yeah, but why? Every corner in Shenzhen has the team/equipment to do it quicker and cheaper. Tom offered a bet and you refused it. All the people claiming power matters aren't showing the math. Power only matters at end-of-life. GPUs are still profitable today. Initial cost and starting date are the biggest factors. It's your choice whether to buy from them or not. Make up your mind. Having the wrong address posted was a mistake. Responding to the mistake with "tough luck, send them again" was gross negligence. The correct response would have been "We'll track down those highly sensitive documents and make sure they are safe." Wanna bet? Excellent work.Now for the next version. Is it time to start considering ASICs? A lot of the current small miners are going to see difficulty go too high as soon as ASICs come online. I see 2 options:1. Split ASICs off to a separate pool.2. Auto-adjust local share difficulty. You criticize Tom for doubting your energy claims, then you come along and state some ROI claims as fact? It sure must be nice knowing what the future difficulty level will be. You know the future. Care to share next month's difficulty level with us? Or are you just a hypocrite and a troll. Who should I believe? The official BFL website or some pseudonym posting on an open forum?Hey can you point me to someone who hasn't gotten a refund from Tom who's asked for one?Â  No?Â  Why not?I know you're pissed that people give you a hard time in your own threads, but you doing it in a competitor's thread, posting under a pseudonym to hide your official business. Well, this is what's known as a "concern troll". Let's look at BFL's refund policy:Talk about trolling. Giving Tom a hard time for a refundable policy, when you offer a "non-refundable" policy. GTFO Inaba. No, you hit a nerve with your slimy unprofessional antics. Go troll your own threads Mr. IPostUnderAPersonalAccountSoPeopleWontKnowIWorkForACompetitor.
Let's say the attacker has a decent 10 GH/s farm. It would only take him 3 months on average to solve 6 blocks. Doesn't sound practical to me. How's that response coming along? Can we expect to see it in 4-6 weeks? So what you're saying is you intended all along to have a fan underneath case? Why don't the pictures on your product page show the Single as it truly is? Why is honesty so hard for you? Yes, you were noobs, but only because you didn't pay attention to the existing FPGA products that were on the market before you.Yeah, you bought some FPGAs really cheap. Big deal. Design-wise, the Single sucked! I mean, the case was pretty, until you had to put a honkin' fan underneath it to keep it from burning up. Here, look at it again.http://www.butterflylabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Rev-1-2-3.jpgWhat a kludge. Mining wreaks havoc on gates, whether it's a CPU, GPU, FPGA, or ASIC. Mining absolutely hammers it, 24/7/365. Mining will wear out any device far faster than normal usage. A lifetime warranty on a mining-only device is a nice feature, but likely the lifetime of such a product is about 2 years for most people. By then it's unlikely to be profitable to continue mining on it. A "51% attack" could mean any number of different things. Each of those could require a different response. So what sort of attack are you concerned with? I'm quite sure. e-gold dealt directly with fiat. Bitcoin has *nothing* to do with fiat. Someone like MtGox has to be concerned, but that's an entirely separate issue. I figure if President Clinton can take a $2/piece deduction on donated underwear, then I can too! What legal concerns? There is nothing illegal about Bitcoins. Stating otherwise is pure FUD. Treat them as any other kind of non-fiat donation. I donate my underwear and even cash anonymously to the Salvation Army, and then take a tax deduction for it, as do millions of other people. Bitcoin donations are no different. All I saw from his message was excuses about how he was harrassed by the evil government "Only the government lost out", how innocent he was "My role was mostly as a software & license supplier", how unfair his sentencing would be ("federal system had a 97% conviction rate...Â  higher than the Russian courts under Stalin". Signing emails with a false name "Sonny K".Whatever gave you the idea Sonny has reformed anything? So what is the Bitcoin Foundation? Where is it incorporated? Is it a non-profit? Who owns it? Where are its bylaws? You make me laugh.Satoshi has provided us with a license to the source code. As long as we abide by that license, Satoshi really can't say what we do with it. But, for example, if you try to remove that copyright notice and put your own notice in place and pretend that you own it, you could receive a DMCA take-down notice for violating those copyrights. I suggest you pay attention to the license of any software you run. Gone or not, he still owns it. Not you. The only people who "own" Bitcoin are the people who own the copyright to the source code. I see people like Satoshi Nakamoto, Pieter Wuille, John W. Wilkinson, and others listed in the source files as truly owning it. I haven't looked at all the files, but I'm sure you're in there somewhere. Where is the notice for the parts you own? Be patient. It takes a lot of time to fabricate good-sounding replies to all the questions asked. It's nice to see someone trying something really different from Bitcoin. I think the idea of getting votes from peers has some merit. It'll be interesting to see how well it works. It's hard to take PPC as anything more than a pump-n-dump when the block reward has already dropped in half...twice. The only thing that would affect scaling would be some large miners purposefully mining on p2pool and witholding the blocks. That would be very costly to do so, but it is possible. p2pool is distributed mining.
Don't believe that for a second. The current round of ASICs are good for maybe 1 year. 2 years tops. By then newer, faster, cheaper, more efficient ASICs will be available, making these 1st gen ASICs just as obsolete as the latest FPGAs will soon be. Actually he is one of the company owners. Damn it. I had hoped I wouldn't need to educate you on the concept of foreign business entities. You can't just set up shop in a foreign state without registering with said state. They are doing business in MO. They must register with MO.Don't take my word for it...http://www.sos.mo.gov/business/corporations/startBusiness.asp I'm glad we agree they should be registered with the state. But a search of sos.mo.gov shows no such registration. Feel free to prove me wrong. Here, I'll even provide the link for you...https://www.sos.mo.gov/BusinessEntity/soskb/csearch.aspBut why do we need to search at all? Why won't BFL provide their MO registration? It's not a secret tax ID number. It's a public registration. These are all things the community has had to dig up. Why is BFL so secretive on basic business topics? What other skeletons in the closet are they trying to hide?All business are required to obtain a license in the states that they do business.https://www.sos.mo.gov/BusinessEntity/soskb/csearch.aspNot having a license is likely tax evasion, another Felony to add to the list. You'd think with the countless millions in pre-order funds they could affort to hire someone that's taken a Business 101 class. His website is pretty clear on that: https://www.casascius.com/It seems to me he's taken enough precautions to minimize risk, probably even more precautions than I would do myself, so I feel pretty confident my measly 2x 10btc coins are safe. Look Inaba, your rants are funny and all, but why can't you answer simple questions that a reputable business would have no trouble answering?* Who owns BFL?* Who runs BFL?* Why does BFL not have a business license?and on and on... Let's make it real. My oldest block mined (that I still have the wallet for):http://blockexplorer.com/b/78744Time: 2010-09-08 22:32:36Difficulty: 712.8848641BVHdyTQnVXQJVyE24uY9SxPB36eCQRqS2Code:$ bitcoind verifymessage 1BVHdyTQnVXQJVyE24uY9SxPB36eCQRqS2 HNSndm0ZsXURdV0cbO19DSWQmrhU3yapXGeg1BtkAzStWJIWLqlx/MeNXiUTWc3WmjjmsE4YU/ftuQBO4Mhu6s4= "This is my oldest block"trueWho's older? He'll answer in 4-6 weeks. Yeah, you just log into mtgox and use bank wires to cash out. Why isn't BFL registered in the state of Missouri where you are doing business? Most founders/owners of companies do have such power. I ask that he confirm/deny it.Which statements?Where did he state he no access?  You're really going to compare owning a few shares in a public company to being an owner of a private company? How many of those 500 companies have added your signature to their bank account signature card?You're right, since you have no access to their bank account.Owners of private companies have great leaway in what they can do.BFL can answer these simple questions:Does Sonny have any access to the BFL bank account (i.e. is his signature on the signature card)?Can Sonny sign corporate checks? He's a part-owner. He may not be the only one in charge, but he's definitely one of them. The hiding of the fraud conviction of a primary company officer is just the next item in a long list of questionable activities.No comparison. Microsoft is a public company, and as such is under far stricter rules than a private company. For example, the entire list of Microsoft board of directors is:SteveÂ  BallmerDinaÂ  DublonBillÂ  GatesRaymond V.Â  GilmartinReedÂ  HastingsMaria M.Â  KlaweStephen J.Â  LuczoDavid F.Â  MarquardtCharles H.Â  NoskiDr. HelmutÂ  PankeJohn W.Â  ThompsonAnd what are the names of the individuals on the board? What a lousy bet. BFL has promised shipments in Oct. Everything you send to Mt Gox is very much at risk. Dollars, Bitcoins, Identification, etc. All of it. Mt. Gox has already had their password database stolen and published online for everyone to make a copy of. Hashed passwords were cracked and countless further thefts occurred because of it.https://mtgox.com/press_release_20110630.htmlYou can make small withdrawals without sending them your identification.https://support.mtgox.com/entries/20919111-aml-account-statuses But with taint all the nice people will be treated like assholes and the assholes will find ways to avoid the taint. Taint is like copy protection. It never hurts the pirates. It's pretty clear from Sonny's message, "I am not a majority owner." (emphasis added), that he is not just an employee (as frequently implied by Inaba), but is actually an owner of the company. I don't think realize how expensive electricity is here.
I just turned off my 6990s. They'll be for sale shortly. ngzhang is a good guy. But the trouble with these 100% funded pre-orders is the potential for total loss, whether on purpose (scam) or not (accidental). I would consider paying a small downpayment, but I'm not paying for a non-existent product. Credit card companies love to do chargebacks, so 6 months is not unusual. Even after that, just give them a call and they'll rip the funds right out of the merchant's account no questions asked. Assuming the merchant is still in business... That's a prototype FPGA using the boards then went into the MiniRig. And how much power do they take? Speed of delivery is of the essense. Don't waste time and money buying power supplies and building fancy cases for it. There's a good chance difficulty could skyrocket before Feb. Every day saved is crucial to profitability. Why don't you put it in writing now? One of the reasons Bitcoin has been successful has been the fact that the rules were fixed at day one and have not changed since then. Imagine if Satoshi had said, "50 BTC per block, and then someday I'll change it to 0 BTC when I think we have enough Bitcoins out there." How well do you think that would work? Isn't it being checkpointed every block by a centralized server? There's no 10min limit. There is only a 10min average target over 2016 blocks. That's a very large amount of potential variance. They sell products that do not exist while pretending that they do.They promise 1000 MH/s @ 20 W and deliver 832 MHs @ 80 W.They promise 4-6 weeks and can't deliver a single item within that timeframe in 6+ months.You see, it has nothing to do with "the man", etc. It has everything to do with their shady business practices.I say it encourages better business practices. I too would suggest getting an SSL cert. They aren't expensive. But to be honest, SSL is little more than security theater. Just because your info passed securely to a server, there's no guarantee that they'll keep the info secure. Credit card databases are stolen all the time. Almost as often as Bitcoin wallets. So when I toss a coin in the air and call out "HEADS", and it lands on heads, that's pretty convincing that I can control a coin toss?Look, shares start out at 10 seconds on average. When the hashrate goes up, difficulty goes up, and share rate goes to ... 10 seconds on average. "bad luck" is not caused by an increased hashrate. Perfect! We can all rest knowing that someday somehow maybe there will be a solution. No, it's not acceptable.DOA blockchain. I'm sure there will be some pump-n-dump, but in the end, it'll die. Well said, sir! That would simply fork the chain. Miners will reject those bogus blocks. There very much is a party line. It is: "Everything is on schedule". "4-6 weeks" is the biggest joke on bitcointalk because month after month, even after shipping hundreds (thousands?) of Singles, they never were honest on the shipping schedule.Then answer this honestly. How bad is the current backlog? What is the estimated ship date for an SC order placed today? Hi Luceo,I see from your registration date that you are new around here, and my initial post was very short, so let me explain why it's so funny.RealSolid (aka CoinHunter and countless other fake personas) is a guy who has led a campain against Bitcoin for quite some time now. SolidCoin/MicroCash is supposed to be the worlds greatest cryptocurrency. Read http://solidcoin.info/solidcoin-ready-for-bitcoin-collapse.php for just one example of his rhetoric. MicroCash is just SolidCoin version 3, since version 1 and 2 failed spectactularly, he had to rename it to try to avoid the negativity from all the failed SolidCoin versions.If he had asked for SolidCoins as donations I wouldn't make fun of him. So for him to beg for Bitcoins of all things, when he's so anti-Bitcoin, is quite ironic. http://forums.microcash.org/index.php/topic/633-future-of-microcash/RealSolid begging for Bitcoins so that he can continue working on MC.  This. Until I see a police report, this "DannyMaddox" account is a fake.
BFL is "a market leader in microprocessor design", so they're clearly on par with AMD and Nvidia. I expect BFL will use 28nm. You're worried that spammers will spend $100,000 to grow the blockchain by 10 GB? That costs a miner $1 worth of disk space. That's a very ineffective attack! That's not going to stop any miners. As much as I hate gambling in general, SatoshiDice is providing a valuable service to Bitcoin, submitting valid transactions with fees to the network. This is exactly what we want to happen. The blockchain is growing because people are using it. 2 GB blockchain? That's nothing. I want to see a 2 TB blockchain! Bring it on! BINGO! If BFL does ship an ASIC, and the difficulty shoots up too high, I would rather quit mining than give a company like BFL any money. The early miner was pretty slow. It took much longer than 10 minutes per block. Only about 100 blocks (5000 btc) were solved by Jan 11. From Single to MiniRig is FPGA to FPGA. Not much different. Going from FPGA to ASIC is going to have a whole new pile of surprises for them. Someday it will change. Hopefully that will be many years in the future. *No* encryption is future-proof. Read the article. There is one address that holds about 5%. The next largest address holds about 1%. Nobody has 12.5%. Since SHA-256 is so easy, why was BFL's FPGA power&performance estimates off by a factor of 5? BFL is still trying to get the minirig out the door. If the ASIC was so close to being done it would be a waste of effort building new FPGA systems. Nice distortion of the facts. BFL takes payment upfront, then delivers months later. Enterpoint takes payment and then ships immediately.I double-dog dare BFL to grow up and become a respectable business and not require payment up front on SCs that don't exist. I'm looking over some of the orphan races at:http://blockchain.info/orphaned-blocksRaces where 2 blocks are found with timestamps a few seconds apart is to be expected. But I'm seeing quite a few races where block are minutes apart. If it's taking blocks minutes to propate across the network, we've got a problem.Like here's a particularly nasty one.http://blockchain.info/block-index/232898/0000000000000873fda1001c4986936dfa3697ec84ff74e48c11fe9d355be07fvs.http://blockchain.info/block-index/232896/000000000000069c27242a928e33e45ddd27d6fd014c77946ba4d3d2891f5398Some poor miner finds a block, and 30 minutes later DeepBit still hasn't received that block and thus orphans it when they find a block. 30 minutes! What is with all the orphans? Is the large block size too much for miners with slow uplinks? The point is the same as their announcements have always been. To get customers to fund their development of new products and to prevent people from buying any competitor's products. Lookout AMD and Intel, there's a new player in the house! http://www.butterflylabs.com/pre-order-form/They just can't seems to get rid of the never-met 4-6 week promise. Look at how long it took BFL to release products based on regular FPGAs. There's no way they'll release a "full custom ASIC" before the block reward halves. ASICs like that are a long way off. There's plenty of time for FPGA profits. That's a monster fan for a 10 watt chip! Don't worry, SolidCoin5 is ready for MicroCash's collapse.
Notice they didn't specify which year. Stop looking at short-term averages. They're not valid. Looking at long-term averages, p2pool is running at roughly 90% expected payouts. For me, that 10% loss is acceptable due to all the other benefits that p2pool offers. The open communication and honesty are sure a breath of fresh air compared to some other FPGA company. Keep up the good work. Tainting won't make it less profitable for theives. Just like copy protection, the tainting will only make things difficult for the honest users. Thieves will just work around any tainting you propose. My 6 Icarii in an Ikea Lack: So today's Bitcoin developers were paid for all future development back in 2009? Satoshi must have been a time traveller to know who all was going to work on Bitcoin and pay them all when the chain was launched! Bitcoin core software = free softwareBitcoin mining software = free softwareThis bitstream = non-free software built on the backs of free softwareThat's my problem with it. Without Bitcoin, this bitstream is worthless. But I don't hear eldentyrell splitting his manditory mining-tax with the upstream developers that made this all possible.How about it eldentyrell? How much of your mining-tax are you sending back upstream to benefit the Bitcoin/Mining developers? Did you even read the message you quoted. Let me trim it down for you...See that? You jumped when you were specifically told not to jump. p2pool is not for jumpers. No reason? BFL has provided a plethora of reasons. I'd be happy to provide a long list for you. It doesn't exist. It won't for many months. They've announced that they'll announce next month that they'll someday do ASICs. Ok, I'll print block 0. Who's next? https://bit-pay.com/accountingHelp.html"The maximum payout per day is 1000.00 USD or 1000.00 EUR."That's not a very workable solution for most merchants. Does anyone know if bit-pay will increase that limit? No, it comes from people not understanding that the blockchain needs to be up-to-date. That's simply a matter of educating the users.And don't try to change the subject. You claimed mobile clients for Bitcoin require a 1.3 GB blockchain download. They don't. 4 individual heat sinks so each one is perfectly mated to the chip, and one large fan. Very very nice. notyep, the more you open your mouth the more you look like a fool.https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet&hl=enAndroid Bitcoin Wallet, doesn't use a host provider, and doesn't store a 1.3 GB blockchain. Someone ran the numbers, and I don't feel like looking them up again, so feel free to correct the actual numbers. Basically, in a month or so (assuming the chain isn't reset...again), anyone with less than a couple hundred dollars worth of MC$ will pay more in daily fees than they get in daily interest.In other words, all the poor people will have their funds transferred to the rich people. Let me explain some basic business to you. Read the following:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_agentYou have no registered agent in the state of your incorporation. An email address isn't good enough. If for example someone sued you for delivering a product that didn't meet your claimed specs, you wouldn't receive the official notice and would fail to appear at court,Â  automatically losing the case by a default judgement. No, it's not. There are countless banks in the real world that provide free checking and savings accounts. My jar of pennies on my shelf also stores cash indefinitely at no charge. Digital currencies should also be free to store their value. Transaction fees and block rewards provide plenty of value to the miners. You're joking, right?Let's search https://wyobiz.wy.gov/Business/ViewCertificate.aspx for their business standing: What industry buys used Singles for greater than the purchase price? More code copied from Bitcoin, eh? Will the source code include the required licenses?
That is right. Savings means it's not being transferred, therefore no fees. A wallet from 2009 will have exactly the same number of Bitcoins today and forever.Wrong again. No miner can force a fee on any transaction. If a transaction doesn't meet a miner's fee requirement, then the transaction will simply be mined by someone else. Because my coins are there, and I really want to keep them. I don't want my coins to evaporate because you can't spare a little hard drive space. What sort of crap system do you have? Even my phone can run a Bitcoin client just fine.It's already been implemented in some of the Bitcoin clients.  Can you add this one:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=78239.0 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=78239.0Add this one to the list. With the introductory pricing it looks amazing and will probably sell quite a few units very fast. They don't seem to have the production issues BFL is plagued with. MicroCash: Taking from the poor and giving to the rich. I'm confused. The main Satoshi client is develop on GitHub:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoinThis one is hosted on Gitorious:http://gitorious.org/bitcoin/bitcoind-stableIf they are the same, then what's the point in gitorious?If they are different, then it isn't the Satoshi client and belongs in the Alternative Clients forum. Will this be an open board, i.e. will community developed bitstreams be relatively straight forward? Shouldn't this be in the alternative clients forum? That was my thinking. Heat pipes are great when you need to move the heat output to a different location so a larger fan will fit. But their heat pipe design doesn't move the heat any more than a large heat sink would. Yup. Full payment up front, and in 6 months you may get a Mini Rig. That is exactly what Bitcoin does, and has done since the very first day it was released more than 3 years ago. There have been absolutely zero changes to the block reward. It is that trust that has been built over time that makes Bitcoin successful.Answer this: How many times has SolidCoin changed the reward scheme?Pyramid scheme, bait-and-switch, pump-and-dump, I not sure which scam term is most accurate of SolidCoin, but make no mistake, SolidCoin is very much a scam designed to benefit early adapters at the expense of later adopters. SC started out as open source, but then progressed to a more restricted proprietary license. It's quite logical to assume that no mention of the source code in the announcement means there will be no source code released. I know, silly of me for thinking anything about SC follows logic. That's what you said when SC1 was released.That's what you said when SC2 was released.Now you're saying the same thing again.More of the same. Big promises that turn out empty.The only thing I'm wondering is, where's the source code? You are confusing ASIC with IC. An ASIC has fixed-logic, an FPGA has programmable-logic. While they are both ICs, they are two very different kinds of ICs. Who cares if you get a share in every block? You'll still get roughly the same number of payouts each day, even at a deepbit-size level.Now if p2pool was 10 times the size of deepbit, then the difficulty would be so high that lots of small miners would not get daily payouts. That would be a problem. I look forward to p2pool growing so large that becomes a problem. Average daily payout would be the same. Time to find shares would go up, and blocks found per day would also go up.A slow 1 gh/s miner on p2pool gets a share on average every 45 minutes while p2pool finds a block every 4 hrs. Deepbit is 10 times the size of p2pool, so the 1 gh/s miner would get a share every 7.5 hrs and p2pool would find a block every 24 minutes. Large scale p2pool miners can adjust their share-rate, which will make shares easier for slow miners. Why is there no mention of the source code being open source? It points to the poor design of the system in the first place. Poor design means long-term reliability is a serious concern. I'm not too worried about the reward dropping. Either the price will go up or the difficulty will go down (or both). Either way, the profitability will still be good for mining with energy efficient FPGAs. .08/kwhI got in on the bulk order, so the cost was only $469. I expect with adequate cooling I can run a 400 mhps bitstream on them. That puts the ROI at about 378 days.They haven't arrived yet, but ETA looks like about 3 weeks.
I picked up some Icaruses that'll break even in about 1 year. I expect them to last at least 2 years which puts the investment at over 100% return. I consider that most excellent.Nobody has a warehouse of these things. Everyone is just doing small runs that are sold as soon as the orders are open for them. It's great to see a quad board, but...850 MH/s @ $5 per btc = $82/month (ignoring power costs).$1355/82 = 16.5 months to break even...but it gets worse, in 8 months the btc reward will drop in half. Unless the price of bitcoins doubles when the reward drops, this product will need roughly 2 full years to break even, even without taking into consideration power costs. Check btc-e.com.Highest SLC buy order: .0063Highest NMC buy order: .0065 This is what makes a private ASIC farm extremely risky. Building ASICs to sell to the public on the other hand is far more profitable and much less risky. Quite true. At 2 million difficulty these rigs are still exceptionally profitable. And when the block reward drops to 25 btc/block, they're still very profitable. If my btc wallet was bigger I would totally order one. Your night time power looks really good, but still plausible. But I can't imagine how you pulled off that day time power draw. What are the rest of your settings (volts, clocks, etc.)? Run p2pool. That way you can set a username for each miner, and there are charts generated automatically. Best of all it's solo mining with the variance of a 360 GH/s pool. Not really. Since the block reward was reduced to virtually nothing, the chain has dropped down to about a dozen miners that are just wasting electricity mining the worthless blocks. Is this based on a simulation of the new chip, or on an actual real board? How in the world do you calculate that? The hashing power of p2pool changes continually. GeistGeld should be fast to mine.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=42417.0 Because for every one of those examples a password recovery option is available. People use password recoveries all the time. There is no password recovery for an encrypted wallet. Encrypted wallets by default would be a disaster. Very cool. Donation sent. While the profit from mining is nice, it's not the only reason to mine. Buying coins does nothing to increase the network security. Mining does. So rather than calling miners stupid, you should be thanking them for making the network stronger. All at once is nice, but if I can get some of them sooner, then separate is good too. Sounds ideal. Make sure Bitcoins for payment are still an option.

I need to know details on payment and shipping. If it is low risk, then I'm in for 10. You can use it to blow dry your hair. Yeah, but the new one is more like 4-6 weeks away. My coins aren't on technically on MtGox, but believe me they will end up there real fast if the price is right. So while you only see 350k on MtGox at this moment, a whole lot more are just waiting for the right price.
A wise man once said, "profit matters and revenue means nothing". So how much of that is profit? 20% would be $3594.And if they kept them for 4-6 weeks, they'd make an additional $3300 in profit. They just doubled their profit. Who doesn't like to double their profits? If this is indeed a botnet, then 85.214.124.168 is just going to be an infected C&C node. While it's definitely a good idea to notify the server owner, shutting that node down isn't going to stop the botnet. It was addressed in the original Bitcoin design. Over time, the block reward will drop to zero, and transaction fees will make up the majority of the value of mining blocks. Nothing more needs to be done. 1. I'm a cheapkate.2. I'm lazy.If the default donation was 0% I would never change it. A meager default donation (which can be turned off)Â  in exchange for developing the awesome p2pool is an extremely fair request. About 40% of the network has already turned off the donation. I'm afraid if the default was off, the donations would drop considerably. At less than 1 btc per day, the donations are quite small for all the hard work developing p2pool.Leave the default donation on. Someday you too will care ... when you move out of mom's basement. Click the giant "Buy Now" banner which will lead you to shopping page. Click on the X6500 product which leads you to:http://cablesaurus.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=58 Da red ones go fasta! Let's say that happens. Then what? Which scenario do you think will play out:A. Empty-block miners see their blocks invalidated, so they pack up and go home.B. Empty-block miners see their blocks invalidated, so they create a little dust so they don't have empty blocks anymore.Bottom line: Empty-block miners are passing up on fees. That's their loss, and everyone else's gain. That's what I don't understand. The vast majority of ASIC cost is in the design. Whether you produce 25 or 250 chips, the cost is nearly the same. A custom chip wouldn't need to be a "trade-secret", because no one would be able to get the same chip anywhere else. So clearly the BFL Single is using an off-the-shelf chip. That's the kind of "secret" that will not stay secret. I don't believe it. You'd have to get about 300 KH/s on only 100 watts. Name a CPU and/or GPU that can do that. BFL had to add a second fan due to overheating, and even then it starts slowing down if room temperature isn't cool. This does not bode well long-term for them.Icarus looks like a far better engineered product that will stay profitable a lot longer. Icarus also has a volume discount.It comes down to how long do you plan on mining before you throw the FPGA away? 6 months? Then BFL if you can get one. 1+ years? Icarus. How in the world are you getting 10.5 KH/s per core? Then you should consider modern FPGAs like Icarus and X6500. Way more power efficient. BFL Singles will become unprofitable long before other FPGAs. A well-built 7970 rig is way more efficient that you listed:If you have efficiency concerns, you're better off with a modern FPGA, such as Icarus or X6500. They'll give you double the effeciency compared to BFL. P2pool shares aren't a blockchain. They don't invalidate each other. Until a real Bitcoin block is solved, all the shares accumulate and are valid. Why would you assume that? Their initial claims were wildly wrong. Didn't you get the message? You need to go pick up your Singles at their offices. Bitcoind not up to date? What's the output from "bitcoind getinfo"? Had that been their plan from the beginning, and had they been honest and up front about it, they would have had everyone here cheering them on. Yet they're doing the same thing over again with the "Rig Box". Accepting pre-orders based on specs that just aren't going to be close to any finished product once they actually start developing it.
At the risk of letting him in on something he might not already understand, there is no way to "turn over" a digital file. He can always maintain a copy of the private keys and you can never prove he didn't keep a copy. Then when the time is right, he can use his copy of the private keys to cash-out/destroy/etc. the chain.The SolidCoin 2 chain can never be trusted no matter who CH or RS is. SolidCoin 3 might be different, but only if they eliminate those enforcer nodes completely and stop arbitrarily changing the rules of the game. I've tested the wattages (via KillAWatt) for my undervolted 2x5970 rig with 0-4 GPUs mining.Num GPUsTotal Watts01751230228533404395At my current settings, each GPU eats 55 watts and generates 530 MH/s. That's roughly 4.82 MH/W. I could probably increase the clock a little bit, and use a more efficient power supply to reach the quoted performance.A 7970 is significantly more efficient than a 5970. It's guaranteed that when the exchange rate is high enough, he's going to cash out as many coins as possible. He'll justify it in his mind by saying he's worked thousands of hours for free, the chain owes him even more than that, because he's one of the valuable programmers in the world. Anybody running an old version is going to have p2pool stop working. That's going to affect the hashrate until everyone upgrades. Even 80 watts is optimistic: Sounds great. How does this work? I've built servers with up to 256 GB RAM. For the sake of estimates, let's say 1 TB RAM is about tops right now. That's 2^40. If we extrapolate with Moore's law, we'll max out 64-bits (2^64) in about 36 years. (Realistically it's going to be a lot longer than that) There's no way MS is going to support Win9 40 years from now. There's no 128-bit hardware in the works, so there's no point in designing 128-bit software for the foreseeable future.256-bit computing will likely never happen. I can't speak to LTC efficiency, but those BTC wattage figures are using a very inefficient Bitcoin GPU miner. A good GPU system can get about double that performance for the same wattage. $7 in electricity (not even counting the hardware depreciation costs) to generate a coin that's worth $.04. That sure is a very twisted meaning of "fair". I see coinotron is up to 28 miners. That's nearly 60 total miners in the world mining SolidCoin! Sorry, it's hard to keep up with all the flip flopping. One minute they're unspendable...The next minute they're spendable...Block reward changes randomly from 32 to 5 to .07.Etc.Is there any part of SolidCoin that isn't susceptible to your whims? 4-6 weeks for the singles? There's a shocker. Notice the key word, "should". Which means he is admitting he can make them spendable any time he wants.

I see you failed to address the issues I pointed out. Again. I'll take that as a confirmation that I'm right. Evolution isn't being kind to SolidCoin.Of the last 100 SC blocks, coinotron has solved all half of them. Coinotron has 26 miners. That means there's a grand total of 50 SolidCoin miners. RIP SolidCoin. You have the private keys that control the wallets that fund the control nodes. As anyone familiar with bitcoins knows, he who holds the private keys holds all the power. You've already admitted to being able to shut down control nodes. We all know you can. Right. I think a p2pool size of 200-300 GH/s is about right. On average that's 3-4 blocks found per day at the current Bitcoin difficulty level. That's smooth enough variance for someone with a single GPU. If the current p2pool starts reaching 400 GH/s, we should plan on splitting it in half. I prefer btc-e.com myself, so yup, I couldn't care less what mtgox does. Once they allowed their password database to get hacked I swore them off forever. You can find lots of other exchanges at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Real-time_Trading There, fixed it for you. Actually, it's not. The reality is, pools are collections of members. 10's of thousands of members. If the members don't like the change, they can switch to other pools, p2pool, or even solo mining. Pool ops cannot force any change on anybody.For example, if deepbit decided to double the fee they charge, their hashrate would plummet as miners moved to other pools. If deepbit started running code that gave them 1 billion coins, the miners would switch to other pools and invalidate deepbit's bogus blocks.Keep spewing your lies and we'll keep smacking you down for it.
And if they don't agree to your forced changes, you can revoke their accounts because you have the private keys to those wallets. They are nothing but shills. You're such a liar. The Bitcoin devs have no control over what users/miners run.  CoinHunter bans people that disagree with him. He also edits other people's posts so that it looks like those people agree with him too. Of course the vote is stacked. Put the same poll up here and you'll see a very different result. Cool. Just checked my logs and I found a block yesterday. Woot! Who appointed you King Ethics? How did you determine that Artforz owes it to the community to develop the best scrypt miner and release it publicly?Go crawl back to your own forums where you ban people that disagree with you and edit other people's posts to suit your own agenda. Here's a great command to list found blocks:Code:bitcoind listtransactions I heard that all SolidCoin blocks fund transfers to CoinHunter's personal wallet. When he gets tired of playing with SolidCoin, he's planning on cashing them out and killing the chain. I'm sure the plan will be to remove the central node "in 4 - 6 weeks".  What are the exact conditions that must be met for this to occur? Or is this just a vague promise that will never come to pass? 2nd block found for the day and creeping up on 200 GH/s! "Probably"? There are no "two consenting parties" when one side has the contract and the other side guesses what the contract contains. That is a very rough average based on the current difficulty level combined with the estimated hashrate. Since the difficulty and estimated hashrate change every 10 seconds, you can't accurately compare the quoted average over a period of minutes, let alone weeks.Hashing blocks has huge variance. While the average time for p2pool to find a block might be 10 hours, there's about a 10% change it'll end up being 30 hours. Perhaps you have some idea what this central node is and you haven't explained it. But as it is now:1. Miners provide network security in the absence of a central node.2. You have a central node.Therefore, you have no need for miners.If you have the miners performing bitcoin-like hashing, they will simply be wasting electricty for nothing. Call them affiliate nodes or something else, because they are not miners. There were a couple days after that without a subsidy, but there have been two in the last day or so. Users send transactions to miners, miners send blocks to corporate node. Why not just have users send transactions to corporate node? Miners are only useful when there is no central authority. Once you stick in some sort of central authority, then there's no point in having miners. I'm counting down the days for Mass Effect 3. I'm checking out the website at http://masseffect.bioware.com/. Where's the contract stating the terms of the DRM that will be included in the game? Or do I have to wait until I break the seal on the box and void any chance of returning it to find out what the contract DRM is?Ok, maybe I need to pre-order it then. Surely then they'll specify the terms of the contract so I can agree to them...go to gamestop.com...add pre-order to cart...click checkout...enter my credit card info...Hmm. Where again was that contract I agreed to? Who said you need to cash them all out at once? If coins can be stolen, they can be traded, cashed in, saved, etc.Let's look at mtgox order book:You can cash more than $1,000,000 worth of bitcoins right this moment, and only drop the price to $2.70. There is plenty of money available for the taking in the blockchain. I don't get this part. What is the point of miners if every block needs to go through a centralized authority node? The blockchain itself is its own incentive. There are millions of dollars right there, available for the taking. That's far larger than any bounty you will every collect. All you have to do is to find an exploit. You don't think people have already tried? * My miners can mine to an address that is offline. My coins are secure.* P2pool is like a gateway. I can give miners from various locations access to to my p2pool node, without giving public access to bitcoind. My wallet is secure.
1. Hashrate dropped from 34739 to 9021.2. Price dropped from $.05 to $.02Clearly the block reward is still too high. Why don't you try -5 SC per block? Unlucky block, someone's probably trying to hop. More power to them, that's more shares for me! They claim to be pros. "Butterfly Labs has more than a decade of experience in FPGA & ASIC stand alone system design." Leave BFL alone...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmvkRoEowc Thin clients are a nice idea. Those are already available for Bitcoin:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50936.0 Just my luck. I double my hashing on p2pool and then dry spell. Argh!Seriously, a day or two without a block is no big deal. p2pool is running great! Dibs on the beef ramen. It's not pretty but it's there in the output: No surprise there. He's eliminating miners by what he calls "thin clients". All transaction processing is being moved to the control nodes. With more fees, of course. Yes. It doesn't matter which one you move. I already had p2pool running so I added:to litecoin.conf. Highly unlikely. GPUs are extremely reliable. They have several temperature monitors and will down-clock when they detect overheating. FPGAs? Nada. If you have any cooling issues (fan stops, etc) with an FPGA it'll fry itself before you know it. You called it all right. Everyone is bailing out. Here's the latest trades on btc-e.com:And slc24.com:Game over man, game over. Why is it everyone who's been in contact with BFL never posts any "actual information"? So if you actually ordered one, when is it due to ship? Is it really possible that total p2pool size including both chains is 270 GH/s? How did you arrive at that estimate? The DE4 and DE0 are very different products. Search this forum for BFL to get an idea of how accurate FPGA estimates turn out.That sounds like you have a non-working prototype. How do you know it's hashing at all if you have 100% rejects? Have you developed an "immensely quick" random number generator? You've succeeded in driving away 2/3rds of the miners nearly overnight, so you must be trying to shut it down. Congrats, it's working. Developer releases new version, people choose to upgrade? Is that supposed to be scary? That's how Bitcoin has been working all along. But being in compliance now pretty much makes the previous releases moot. That's really all you can hope for with an MIT license. And that's what we mean by Bitcoin is decentralized. The developers have to convince miners, but the developers cannot compel anyone to do so. The miners chose. Well, the MIT license doesn't have a termination clause, like the GPL does, so coming into compliance is pretty much all that needs to happen. No, he cannot make anyone upgrade. Every single miner chooses for himself which version to run. No matter what Gavin does, miners always have the choice whether to download and run the new changes. If 51% of the miners don't do that, then nothing will change.
BIP16 isn't inevitable. Gavin implemented BIP16, checked it in, and nothing happened, because Gavin cannot force any change on anybody. Bitcoin is decentralized.CoinHunter implemented block reward change, pushed it to his enforcer-nodes, and every single SolidCoin user is required to instantly upgrade or their client is completely broken. Yesterday's change broke one of the largest SolidCoin exchanges. Today, btc-e.com still can't process SolidCoin blocks. SolidCoin is centralized. Yes, because those checkpoints are entirely optional, as witnessed by the fact that there are alternate clients that don't include those checkpoints. Or you could download the source and remove every checkpoint. Bitcoin will still work perfectly. I think that says it all. That's like saying PayPal has 51% protection. You might as well run a single enforcer node that processes all transactions. Or is that the plan for SC3 next month? And it's what, 10 times, 100 times harder to mine (I've heard both .7 sc per block and .07 sc per block, so I'm not sure the correct figure)? Seems like the change only benefited early adapters. But then, that was probably the point to the chain all along.Edit: Looks like it's about .08 per block, plus a few tx fees, let's say it's .1 sc per block, down from about 7 sc per block. Difficulty goes up 70x, price goes up 5x. I expect network hashrate to plummet once miners figure out they can't get anything anymore from mining. Good thing SC is designed for plummeting hashrate. In a couple weeks it's going to just be the enforcer nodes hashing away. Wow, progress. I'm impressed. Next time do you think you can put the valid copyright info in the About Dialog so that most users will be able to see it when they run the GUI? Why do you try so hard to give the original authors as little credit as possible? Why do you continue to refuse to comply with the license? It clearly states:The MIT license is one of the simpliest, clearest, and easiest licenses to comply with, and yet you refuse to comply. Why?Furthermore, in the binary distribution, http://solidcoin.info/downloads/solidcoin-204-linux64.tar.bz2, not only is the MIT license not included, but even the Bitcoin copyright notice has been completely removed. Again, you are violating the license. Here's the full text of license.txt:As I posted previously, there is a very clear "The above copyright notice and this permission notice..." term in the original license. You can use your file editor's search function to see that the required notice is not in license.txt. I'm sick of this trash. Can we delete all SolidCoin-related topics? The recently released SolidCoin source code continues to violate the original software license of the code stolen from the Bitcoin project. This forum is no place for illegal activities. Especially when the license is so easy to comply with.Let me quote it:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/COPYINGVersion 2.04 has been released, and again CoinHunter has failed to include the required notices. This license requirement has been brought to CoinHunter's attention many times, and yet he refuses to comply with the license. Ban him and all SolidCoin threads until he complies with the license. As funny as that would be, this forum is better off without him. Sounds like CoinHunter has enough coins in his personal wallet from the CPF transfers, and now he wants to pump the price up so that he can dump the coins. What a joke! p2pool is already averaging almost 2 blocks a day, and getting even faster as it grows. IMO that's plenty low enough variance for the average miner. 4x5970s is a lot for single rad. Try putting fans on top and bottom for a push-pull configuration to maximize airflow. Also try to undervolt a bit. That will save a lot of heat. If the current p2pool grows 10x, it would still work quite well for most miners with at least 1 good GPU. If it grows much past that, it would be trivial to split the pool to p2poolA and p2poolB. Definitely. Any time spent reconfiguring miners is lost money. The subsidy was enough to let me take down my miners and switch them to p2pool without losing anything.Another factor was the size. With 100+ GH/s, blocks come on average slightly better than once a day. That's low enough variance for me. I can just monitor my bitcoin address from anywhere to see if everything is still running.The final point was the decentralized nature. I don't like seeing Bitcoin in 2-3 centralized pools. P2pool is magic.My only concern at this point is the stability of the p2pool script. That needs to stay running 24/7. Thankfully no problems in the first few days. Very few miners still run bitcoind nodes. So all you need to do is get the top 2 or 3 pool operators to switch to the new code and you've secured the 55%. Are any of the pools on board so far? As a potential customer, it makes sense for me to investigate their product. There's plenty of FUD going around, but that's directly caused by BFL's major problems.We Fear the shipped product won't meet their claims because BFL keeps changing the claims. We are Uncertain when they will ship because BFL keeps changing the ship date. We Doubt they know what they're doing because BFL launched products solely based on a simulations.The FUD is all BFLs fault. I run two kinds of nodes, a bitcoind node and a phoenix-miner node. Which one, or both, of these nodes needs to be updated to support P2SH? Where does it say this is backed by BTC? And this is why this altcoin will implode. There is no future for it. Pump and dump asap.
Plus, great resale value, makes it a pretty good deal. Yeah, setup wasn't too bad. I've already got a couple shares in on the current round. Documentation could use some work, but otherwise everything else looks good. That's with 4 cards, so 621 MH/s per card. I love the idea of p2pool, but I hate reconfiguring my miners. Sounds like p2pool is big enough that it's worth trying out. Here goes... Ever hear of mybitcoin.com? How about bitcoin7.com? Need I go on?Cross your heart and hope to die? I guess I fully trust you now. How do I send you my money? So a clone of Bitcoin with a CPU-friendly algorithm and tons of per-mined coins. Sounds useless to me. CoinHunter is stooping to new lows. Now he's editing my posts on his forums to make it look like I support his continued copyright infringement. Is there anything he wouldn't do to protect his fragile ego? Fascinating! That's with 4x 7970?Even with similar clocking, you are pulling 50% better efficiency than the OP! You added an entire extra card, and dropped more than 100 watts. How??? Ditto. He just banned me for discussing copyright issues. And again, he has figured out another way to mess it up. He thinks he can remove all copyright notices from every file, and then bury a vague reference that there may be some code fragments that may be copyright by Bitcoin Developers included somewhere in the package, but he won't tell you, you have to figure it out by comparing SolidCoin source code with Bitcoin source code. A card without a system performs at 0 MH/s/W. The only valid comparison is a complete system. My electricity costs are pretty high, so I'm very interested in efficiency.I tweaked my setup a little more today to get my temps down. With 2x 5970, 675 MHz, .95V = 1172 MH/s @ 412W = 2.84 MH/W. That's about the best I can do without switching to 3x cards in a larger case.The new cards are using a new process. We were expecting that the drop in process size would increase hashing efficiency significantly. It's very disappointing seeing the new cards barely hold their own against a 2 year old card when comparing performance per watt. I don't see anything in there that is better than the 1.65 GH/s at 624W I quoted for you. Nope, just a regular mining rig with 3 cards packed in directly next to each other. Not the best setup I know, but it works ok. I should pull one card out so the airflow is better and see if efficiency improves any.Please do. Let's see what they can do! I don't see any underclocked numbers. I'd love to see your best MH/W for a complete system. Let's see. I can get 1.7 GH/s at 625W with 3x5970. That's 2.72 MH/W.You can get 1.122 GH/s at 422W. That's 2.66 MH/W.Roadhog2k5 can get 1.65 GH/s at 624W. That's 2.64 MH/W.2.72 > 2.66.2.72 > 2.64.I'm not interested in any estimated power figures. Drop in 2 more cards and measure it for real and then post your numbers. Another vague msg. "on track" for what, 6-8 weeks from now? Why won't anyone say when they are expecting to ship them? Huh? They're no better than the 5xxx series. It's not. Don't compare an underclocked/undervolted 7970 to an overclocked/overvolted 5970 if you want to compare performance per watt.I can get 1.7 GH/s at 625W with 3x5970 by underclocking/undervolting. 4-6 weeks.
New miners can't "receive all tx'es".Â  They can only receive newly broadcast txs. So basically every time a new miner comes online, it will be missing lots of old txs. Very wrong. Nodes come and go all the time. No tx propagates to all nodes. Consider when a new node comes online, so it didn't see all the previous txs, and it solves a block. Then the whole network invalidates its block because it doesn't include old txs it never saw. How do you *know* that was the reason it took a long time? Post a link to the transaction so we can try to figure out what really happened.Here's what might have happened. You started Bitcoin, created your transaction, and sent it to the network while being connected to just 1 other node. That node then shut down for whatever reason before relaying it to any other nodes. Such a transaction won't be confirmed for a very long time because it failed to propagate. Tweaking the fee schedule won't fix such a problem. The reality is you control SolidCoin. You control the license. You control the source code. You control the wallets that run the control nodes. You control SolidCoin 100%. And assuming they last long enough to break even. Remember, these things were designed to run at 20 watts, and now they're being pumped with 80 watts.  Come on, people. Hype up SC2 so I can dump my holdings. Getting only .003 BTC per SC2 sucks. Sounds like a fun challenge. Now while I do have 2 of these coins, I can't really consider the btc on them secure. There's no way to guarantee that the private key on the coin is not also duplicated any where else. If I could send you an encrypted private key to store on the coin, then I would feel safe in using the coins as a permanent wallet. Get real. Take a look at the box:When the Rig Box was designed, their "design" was the power output from a simulator. We now know how accurate that is. The first time they try to plug 50 GH/s into that little box they'll be in for a big surprise.I'll send 5 btc to the first person to post what FPGA is actually on The Single. Let's see what makes it tick. What's your power setup look like? I'd guess 6x 20amp circuits. That should hold at least 36 5970s for a total of 25 GH/s if you keep the circuits below spec at 80% (16amps continous). You could probaly fit a few more in if you overclock/underclock to optimize your power draw per circuit. Botnets will drive all cpu chains into the ground by chain-hopping. They'll mine one chain, driving the difficulty up slowly, while the difficulty on the other chains drop. Then, they'll switch to the lower difficulty chains and wait for the non-mined chains to drop in difficulty. All the cpu-chains are very chain-hopper friendly. Because we didn't believe their claims. And we were right. There is no 1GH/s, 20w, $700, miner. Their claims have already been proved to be false. The only idiots were the ones that didn't question those claims. It's unlikely we're done finding problems with BFL. Are you claiming to be using a non off-the-shelf FPGA? Since you don't understand power draws, I question how much power you are pumping through those FPGAs. And so since car manufacurers lie about their stats, it's perfectly honest for BFL to do the same. Great logic you have there. Yes, it is quite embarrasing for you to be caught in your lies. Then why didn't you come clean at the time that your measurements were off by a factor of 4+?And I hardly call letting one person see the machine a "public demo". The animosity you're seeing on the forum is due to your lack of honesty. Bitcoiners don't like seeing fellow members scammed. You set off a lot of red flags, and rightly so. Your actual product is miles away from what you claimed it would be. You're still not answering repeated requests to disclose your chips so that an independant evaluation of your claims may be made. Your actions are causing the distrust.Let me ask you a very direct question. When was the first time you measured the actual power draw from an actual unit? If we assume the product actually ships, we're looking at about 10 months mining to break even. What's the warranty, 6 months? How is that "high reliability"? There's a good chance they are driving the circuits so hard that it won't even last till break even.That's why knowing what the chips are is necessary. Since they have less than no reputation, what chips they are using becomes partial validation to their claims. What is the warranty on these boards? Assuming the difficulty and exchange rate stay reasonable constant, it'll take about 2 years to break even, assuming the boards run that long.
That's pretty close to my setup. I'm getting about 2.1GH on 850W with 3x5970, but my cooling is poor. 2.5 MH/W is pretty easy to reach with 5970s. Those were made-up numbers meant to 1. garner attention, and 2. convince people not to buy competing products. Obvious bait-and-switch scam. Harsh? Hardly. Imagine AMD just announced the 7970 will run at 200 watts. Can you image the sort of uproar that would occur if in Jan, when they arrive, they consume 800 watts each?! Optimistic? Claiming 20 watts when it turns out to be 80 watts is quite a bit more deceptive than "optimistic". Your original claims were outright lies. The company name "Butterfly Labs Inc." indicates a legal corporation. What are the details of the incorporation, such as the state of incorporation? Received my 2 silver coins today. They look awesome.But wow the first-bits are hard to ready that small. 243 hours to build an 8 GH/s farm? ROFLMAO. I could build that in a day. Not forwarding the tx only helps if no one else in the entire bitcoin network has seen the tx. The odds of that being true are so minuscule as to be essentially zero. Open up your router port so that your client connects to 100 other nodes, and there's just no way your tx won't get propagated. Or he can just cut the block reward back down again, like he already did once before. There will never be any natural millionaires. Wrong. It doesn't matter how many people sign on to the network. There will be 5 coins generated every 2 minutes no matter how many people start using SolidCoin. A miner that maintains a massive 10% of the entire network hashpower will take 8 years to become a control node. It's highly unlikely that anyone will ever become a control node.Wrong. Bitcoin was never centralized. It was true peer-to-peer from day one. Anyone could fire up the client and start mining and be a true equal peer to every single other peer. That is not centralized.And RealSolid can revoke your license to use the source at any time. You would then be running illegal code. Good luck making that work. No he didn't. He admitted to planning on a capability to drain trust wallets. He said so here: Statement one:Statement two:Plain and simple. Statement one claims accounts can't be drained, statement two says the intention was to be able to drain them. Lie. If miners don't like the exchange rate, they just need to stop selling their Bitcoins. As soon as that happens, the prices will go up. No strike necessary. Exactly. Clients should just send their transactions to the control node, who will create a block of valid transactions at the speed it wants to. Since RealSolid is fond of running a game inside the blockchain, the control node can pass out block rewards on a random basis. This business of miners hashing blocks at increased levels of difficulty is completely unnecessary in the current client/server SolidCoin network. The so called "trusted nodes" are nothing more than control nodes. They are running special code that can filter out blocks/transactions/etc. SolidCoin isn't a peer-to-peer network at all. Well since RealSolid distributed SolidCoin both in source and in binary form, he covered his bases and violated the license no matter how you look at it. Isn't that just swell? Let me quote the license for you.It says "all copies". How can that not include binary distributions? I can confirm that with the BrightSky additions/changes, the source does build and run (64-bit Linux).Now to have some fun with the source... Oh, look...There is no /build directory, and thus no makefile.unix. The released source code is not complete. I want to read it, compile it, run it, debug it, test it. Since SolidCoin is a copy of Bitcoin, and Bitcoin code is quite complex, the SolidCoin source code is not something that can be simply read in a few minutes. The only stupid person is someone who thinks they can fully understand complex source code simply by reading it for a few minutes.
Bitcoin isn't public software. It is "Copyright (c) 2009-2011 Bitcoin Developers". While the technical term is "copyright infringement", "theft" works just as well. How do you verify that *all* the source code was released? Me, I compile it. If it doesn't compile and run, then it's not a full source code release. Bitcoin source code was released with a license clause "The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.". Even though SolidCoin uses a substantial portion of the Bitcoin software, "RealSolid" has replaced all the copyright notices with his own. Shouldn't the original Bitcoin copyright notices be kept intact? Great, since it's so easy, I look forward to you writing one and posting it. Part of reading the code involves compiling the code. And CH has failed to release the makefiles that make it possible to compile the code. I'd call this a partial source code release. There were no makefiles, so there's no way to know if something is missing. Has anyone been able to build from source yet? There are no 1,000,000 coin holders. And with the change to 5 coins/block, there aren't going to be any for many many years. So with solidcoin you are putting 100% of your trust in a single person. Why would you put any trust in a single person who can't keep promises?Oh, you mean the built-in solidcoin "protection" fund? Yeah, why would you do that? I sure hope the source code isn't released. Then I'll have to spend hours compiling it and finding ways to hack it. That will seriously cut into my gaming time. The only thing impossible is your claim. Any protection you put into the software can be simulated if the system is compromised. SC1 isn't dead. Just last night I fired up an old VM that had a copy of SC1 on it. So for fun I launched the SC1. It quickly made 6 connections and got to downloading the blockchain. Somebody is still mining it. That sounds like an expensive place to run a mining company. I'd say they're succeeding. It's because of them that there is no source code released, even though it was promised a long time ago. CH is scared to death what will happen if the source code is released and real attacks occur. That is mostly correct. There are transaction and block size limitations, so there won't be any million-transaction blocks flying around. But you are right, fees are not enforced, and someone can spam the blockchain if they include the transactions in their own generated blocks, or by connecting to other miners that also run no-fee miners. Lol, you idiot. Ever hear of pools? Which is why the source will probably never be released. CH is hoping that security through obscurity is good enough. Don't hold your breath. I wouldn't be surprised if the source was withheld for the sake of "security". http://solidcoin.info/solidcoin-most-secure-currency.phpThere, fixed it for you. http://solidcoin.info/solidcoin-most-secure-currency.phpA million SC account that can't be spent is worthless, and thus not invested at all. Typical CH double-speak.Wrong again. 51% makes double-spends of your own coins possible. A 51% attack on Bitcoin cannot make my coins disappear. If the SolidCoin sources are actually released, then we'll see the real attacks. At what point? Never. He copied Bitcoin to start SolidCoin. Until he throws out 100% of the Bitcoin source code and starts from scratch, he copied Bitcoin.
Pretty hypocritical of you to cry about copying when it was you that copied Bitcoin. How about you stop ripping off your investors and get your rigs back to working the way they should? Your capability as a rig manager is horrible if you can't make a profit under the current conditions. They have invested some $15,000 into hardware, that at one time was generating nearly 13 ghps. When you "turned them off" they were generating a pathetic 8 ghps. I suspect you really still have the full 13 ghps turned on and mining somewhere else all for yourself. Can we all agree that when the price goes up, miners come online, and when the price goes down, miners turn off? I think we can all agree there's a pretty strong correlation from price -> miners.Let's try to walk through the reverse. Assume 25% more miners come online. All miners start putting in sell orders at 25% higher prices. But those sell orders only go through when someone shows up to buy those coins at the inflated price. Miners can't make that happen. Miners cannot create buyers. So there's only a weak correlation from miners -> price. You need to use the right conf file. You can't just create it.https://github.com/Lolcust/GeistGeld/blob/multimergemine2/geist.conf And when this anonymous unofficial pseudo-business crashes, no one will buy those shares, and those 8BTC will be gone. Pardon my french, but this has got to be one of the stupidest investments I've seen. An investor ponies up 8 BTC for the chance (and I'd say a very low chance) of getting 1.2 BTC back in a years time? Idiotic. I'd be happy to offer double that return to anyone with BTC they want to get rid of invest. Sure, CPUs do all sorts of things better than GPUs. CPUs are great at managing interrupts from multiple devices like USB, PCI, etc. CPUs are great at managing memory spaces, protecting system resources from other threads of execution. And so on. None of those have anything to do with hashing algorithms that make the blockchain secure.The beauty of the Bitcoin hashing system is the asymetric nature combined with robust security. Incredible amount of computing power to find a hash, but trivial to verify the hash. I suspect that this new SC "design" is going to mess it up. Yeah, there you go. Donation sent. Put the address on http://blockexplorer.sytes.net/ along with all the other donation addresses. Awesome ama. Put up a donation address. If you need some more coins to replenish your stash, I have plenty that I could sell you for only 4440 USD per coin.  Difficulty adjusts every 240 blocks. There's still 140 blocks to go before the difficulty can come down. That could take another week or two. And even then it'll only drop to 1/4 what it currently is now. Great idea. That'll surely never run in OpenCL...http://vimeo.com/9516301 Thank you. I needed that. I'll humor you.This is your competition. http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40058.0 180 MH/s, 15 watts, $610.Yours, 750 MH/s, 15 watts, $370 plus markup, let's say $610.You are claiming more than 4x the price/performance level. They have several dozen people who put down money for pre-orders. You would sell hundreds, easy, if you could produce them. But you won't, because you're either scamming on purpose, or you've miscalulated ... a lot. It is, without a doubt, too good to be true. I stopped reading when I read that because that's not even close to true. CH screwed up the Bitcoin code, which made it vulnerable to attacks that Bitcoin *does not* suffer from. He screwed it up because he was tinkering with code he does not understand. There just aren't that many gg nodes running. As soon as an exchange goes up then I'm sure you'll start seeing a lot more connections. No, you're some anonymous person posting on an Internet forum. You have zero credibility. You mentioned 5830s so I picked that rigs as an example. 1.71 isn't even my most effecient rig. You have a farm. Are you saying you can't pull off 1.71 Mhash/Joule on any of your systems? Who cares what the wiki says. The wiki is old and outdated.1. Buy quality parts. 60% efficient power supplies are stupid.2. Plug system into Killawatt meter.3. Use latest mining software and optimize hashing parameters.4. Overclock core speed and underclock memory speed.5. Keep fans clean so nothing overheats.There's no rocket science here. Just basic mining optimizations that any half-decent miner would do. Where are those 1000 blocks?
My 4x5830 rig draws 650 watts and outputs 1112 mhps which generates .64 btc and draws 15.6 kwh..15 for 9 hours and .08 for 15 hours is about .11 per kwh average per day.Cost to generate btc is $2.59 per coin.Sounds like his efficiency is half of what it should be. I don't see the point of continuing SC when GG is up and running. Faster blocks, faster difficulty adjustments, faster implementation of bug fixes, etc. I think the biggest problem will be people with 8 connections. Meaning, they don't have ports open, so are really quite poorly connected to the network. These people will get orphaned more often than everyone else. Make your blocks count. Open incoming connections. Won't matter if we have 100 TH. After a few quick blocks, difficulty will adjust, and we'll be right back to 15 second blocks. Where do you live, Hawaii? Break-even is around $.20/kwh on a decent rig. The days of running a farm with electricity rates that high are over. Liquidate your hardware now. The paper is considering the probility of successfully completing a single attack. Roughly:6 bitcoin confirmations = 60 minutes6 gg confirmations = 1.5 minutesOn the gg chain, you can perform 40 times as many attempted attacks in the same time period. So even if the odds for a single attack are the same, you get 40 times as many attempts, so clearly time does effect the security. Ok, that looks much better. That's very good it's sticking so close to projections. 56 hrs ago? 13200 blocks in 56 hours is nearly a block every 6 seconds. I thought this was still targetting 15 second blocks. I'm impressed. I thought with such fast blocks there would be more orphans. I'm seeing only 2%. The frequent difficulty adjustments are also great. Miners come and leave and the difficulty adjusts real fast. Someone's got to do a block explorer so we can see how the blocks are coming. We're at 13000 blocks. Exactly when was this chain started? This alt didn't even change the name of anything from bitcoin? Even the addresses are still bitcoin addresses? Redo! Because the hash-rate is dependent on many variables including OS, SDK version, Driver version, and numerous miner versions and settings. I get about 2% higher performance with phatk than he is claiming, so something isn't quite right. You clearly don't know how to run and optimize other miners. I get 704 on stock 6990s using Phoenix/Phatk. If you'd like to send me a copy of your miner I'll post an independant performance comparison. With only 21 pool shares, that doesn't count. Show something that can run 24 hrs at that output. Is there a working blockexplorer so I can see if this "fix" stopped the spam? The one at http://solidcoin.whmcr.co.uk/chain/SolidCoin is stuck. LOL. By that logic everyone who sells their coins and causes the price to drop is doing so illegally. Oh, you're referring to ArtForz? I thought you were talking about CoinHunter. CoinHunter is the one that actually killed the network by putting out a bad "manditory" update. When the cost to spam BTC is 2000x as costly as spamming SC, then I'd say that's not "the SAME EXACT THING". CoinHunter, did you really just throw a bandaid on the problem by capping all transactions at 4 KB? Just like the 6990 has more stream processors than the 5970? Oh, wait, it doesn't.Nope. All we can do is analyze how previous generations progressed, and extrapolate from there. From the 5000 to 6000 brought about...no change in mining capability. It's highly unlikely the 7000 will be any different. AMD designed it long ago, long before Bitcoin was as big as it is now. 10 second blocks will be mayhem.
FPGAs are about 5 times as costly as GPUs. That's a long way from affordable. Where's the on-demand payout button? I need to cash out my 20 iocoins. Still way high. Something is wrong with your SC pool. Overloaded? I think he's sick of all you people always hounding him, where's my payment, where's my payment. He's the boss. He'll send out dividends when he feels like it. Leave Tawney alone! deepceleron already answered that. Including data from multiple difficulty changes complicates things.I don't feel like busting out my stats, but just a visual examination shows difficulty 567269 to look really bad. I think an analysis of that period whould show a significant deviation from expected results. Something happened to BTCGuild between 6/6 and 6/15. Too many stales. CYA. "subjective"? Like nearly everything you post, including this http://solidcoin.info/solidcoin-ready-for-bitcoin-collapse.php article? Not useful? How about you post the first 13 digits of your 16 digit credit card number. That means I'd have a 1 in 1000 chance (.1%) to guess your credit card number. Care to try me? Shorter block times means the attacker can make more attempts.Think it can't happen? I had to search long and hard to find a real example. I had to go all the way back to...today.Bitcoin network right now: 12.224 Thash/sDeepbit network right now: 5282 Gh/sHow many block can deepbit get in a row with 43% hashpower? Blocks 143334 - 143341 are deepbit blocks. Deepbit just solved 8 blocks in a row with only 43% hashpower. I'm sure if someone analyzed the blockchain we'd find even longer runs of deepbit-only blocks.Variance = someone with <51% can successfully attack the blockchain.Faster block target speeds = more chances to attack = weaker security. You seem to misunderstand now cryptocurrencies work. Read over http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance and come back when you understand it. Yup. Faster blocks mean more attempts can be made, and thus the less secure the chain is.51% just gives you a high probability of succeeding. 50% can succeed. As can 49%, 40%, 20%, etc., they just have lower chances of succeeding. If someone is intent on double-spending, they will attempt it more than once. Again, the faster the chain, the less secure. Think of pool-hopping, but now with chains. If you want to maximize profit you should chain-hop. Hop to the chain with the highest BTC profit. Then when it drops, exchange your other coins to BTC and switch to the next chain. Yes, this concerns me. I'm still getting very high stales. Your electricity costs are significantly below the US average. Many of us are not so lucky. So that's wrong too? There's no 12 hour calculation in the difficulty adjustment period at all? It's simply every 240 blocks exactly, no matter how fast or slow those blocks were found? I'm sorry if "almost all" means 0 to you. Let me try some easier questions for you.The FAQ states:First, what does 400% lower difficulty mean given a current difficulty of 18,246?Why hasn't the difficulty lowered in the last 13+ hours? Let's assume we lose almost all the rest of the miners. What's the longest time that can pass until the next difficulty adjustment? You don't understand that loosing over 80% of your miners in a matter of days as indicative of a larger problem? The SC network is already down to 200G. A little more and a single miner like ArtForz could wipe out your chain. Hell, in a couple days I might be able to. I better dump my SC asap.* Syke goes off to start compiling a custom SC node... Too late. SCGuild already has way more than 51% power. All they would have to do is turn off hashing for one day, difficulty will plummet, then we can get back to getting several blocks a minute.SCGuild, what do you say? Will you turn off the pool for a day? Hi everyone, I'm a cryptoholic. Bitcoins are my cryptocurrency of choice. But sometimes I dabble in other blockchains. Why? Because I can mine them faster with their lower difficulty, and then convert them to my favorite Bitcoins and in the end get more Bitcoins than if I had simply mined Bitcoins. Do I care for those other chains? Not really. I'm just using them to get more Bitcoins. How about you?
The price is a little steep, but not too bad since nobody else has anything similar for cheaper. Hopefully the prices will come down as you grow the business. They do look decent, so I'm tempted.Is the 99.9% certified?How are they individually packaged?What forms of payment do you take? Yes, what I said was entirely accurate, and I'll re-word it in case I wasn't clear enough. You cannot eliminate invalids. You can, at best, reduce them. No pool can eliminate invalid blocks. Invalids are expected and are a direct consequence of the 10-minute target and network propogation effects because solved blocks do not propogate instantly to every node on the network. Another blockchain with a lower target speed, say 3-minutes, would expect to have more invalid blocks.Your spreadsheet is slightly inaccurate because you are including invalids in the 'actual' column, but not in the 'expected' column. Until you can compensate correctly for the 'expected' number of invalids, it's best to leave them out of the 'actual' column calculations. Let's assume a best case scenario. $370 USD for 140 MH/s with $9 BTC/USD means it will take 1.5 years for this to pay for itself, assuming free electricity. If you have to pay for electricity, the time is even longer. Does this device come with a 2-year warranty? I like some of the changes in SC, but at least tell the truth. Lying just doesn't help the cause. You have no idea who owns the first million Bitcoins.I'm not sure losing half the hashrate is something you should brag about. Received in a video card a while back and never used. First one to use it gets it.Steam Activation Code:PF62G-CNM6Z-QK9AP-2428W-PBN37Donation appreciated:1ETt1q47aP2fxEX6SNvryHeh4vWrfka5me Is there something wrong with the stats website? I haven't seen updates in a few hours. Now it's...Not an improvement over the other pools. From your own stats page for the current round:How about removing the false claim about stales?. I don't see these fees documented anywhere. What are the fees?Actually, you have it backwards. SolidCoin is going to be very much concentrated into early adapters. Due to the cap on difficulty increases, block are flying out at a rate much faster than 3 minutes. Because of this, SolidCoin is spewing freshly minted coins to early adapters far faster than Bitcoin ever did. It took about a year to generate the first 1.5M Bitcoins. SolidCoins will reach that level in a matter of weeks. If the price goes up, he looses.If the price stays the same, he looses.If the price goes down a little, he breaks even.If the price goes down a lot, then he wins.If the price is going to go down a lot, he'll make a much bigger profit by selling the hardware now.There's clearly enough interest in mining contracts, especially moderately priced ones. I don't see the point in selling them at a loss. He could easily sell them for a small profit. LOL. You can't keep a small farm running, nor pay out dividends on time. What make you think you could handle anything larger? You're betting that bitcoins will tank this week? If you're so convinced that the price of bitcoin is going to drop, then why don't you sell your miners? Because if the price of bitcoins go up, this contract is even more of a bad move on your part. No wonder you have a waiting list. You are selling contracts at a loss. Why??? For 30 BTC your farm will generate 33 BTC, since there's virtually zero chance of difficulty changing significantly in the coming week. All gone.  Begging for a car is lame.That's a much better reason. Here you go:http://blockexplorer.com/t/4Z8V1qYCPp Decent cost. I'm sure interested people would like some more info:1. How secure is the facility?2. How many amps can the facility pull?3. Is there any cooling? What are the inside temperatures like in the peak summer hours?With even just 150 sq feet, that's a lot of rigs, amps, and heat. Can you handle it? You want more than $200 for a card worth less than $100? Good luck. Correction. The number of coins *sold*, not the number mined. There is a very big difference between the two. My best rig is 4x5830, 1080 mhps, drawing 650 watts.Monthly electricity costs (~$.40/kwh) = $187Monthly bitcoin income = 17.5 BTCBreak even at $10.7 per BTC.Yup, I'm already at break even. So roughly, if difficulty goes to 2,000,00 and price stays at $10, then either I move out of California or shut down my rigs.
Really? Because you don't want to type in a long password on your state-of-the-art Motorola RAZR, you are putting every customer's account at risk. Keep your own password at 'abcdef', but don't prevent the rest of us from entering real passwords. and then I found this from the signup page...Are you kidding me? You are limiting passwords to 12 characters? And you consider this sufficient security? Sounds to me like you're storing the passwords in plaintext. Where are you getting 5870's, and how much are you paying for them? With only 4 pci-e connectors, how do you think you'll power 3 cards? Don't you think something other than a 404 page would make sense? Yes, that would be good to know.I sure hope not. The next time MtGox publishes their password database, and some hacker finds my Paxum password is the same, Paxum has no need to reverse any transactions. I screwed up and it's my fault, not theirs. And yes, I'm speaking from experience. I did lose quite a bit of money due to the previous MtGox database. 404. No more invites? How to limit your bandwidth to 1mbps up and down without bloating up the bitcoin client with unnecessary code:sudo apt-get install wondershapersudo wondershaper eth0 1024 1024 Pretty colors, but, the numbers are way off.  Is a "slot" a 4U spot?What amperage circuits would be provided? Does each slot get a 20 amp circuit? What is the temperature control of the facility?But I could install my own remote-power device, correct?Will you install video cards? Rigs shipped with heavy video cards installed are likely to be damaged by the shipping companies.You really should enforce separate rig networks, otherwise customers could interfere with each others, like with incorrect networking settings, either through mistakes or on purpose.What is the length of contract for a slot? Do you guarantee uptime (network, electricity, etc) of the facility? Kudos to Vladimir for thinking up an innovative way to jump start a pool. It is creative.Exactly. I'd join in half a heartbeat.That was my thinking. Vladimir would basically be a shill. Last and final bump... Using the latest kernel at http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=25860.0 at stock 6990 settings I get 352 mhps vs hdminer's 354. Hdminer is obsolete. End of thread. If if if. If a pink dragon flew by my house and dropped a load of dung on my miner I wouldn't get any more blocks either.Blocks/hour Â Â Â 6.23 / 578 sThe reality is the bitcoin network is still growing. This is too good to be true. Those cards go for double that price on eBay. Sounds like someone is buying old used parts off eBay and charging the investors for new parts. Is there any auditing of invoices, or is everyone just expected to have faith? The regular ClearCoin escrow was fine. If I don't get the item, in 30 days the bitcoins are returned to me as a buyer. There is a huge advantage for a scamming seller. Once the buyer puts the coins in escrow, if the seller backs out, the only way for the buyer to get their coins back is to release them to the seller. This gives the seller the coins without having sent any item. As a buyer I would never use this service. I must have a different model. Mine only goes up to like 875.  It would be more readable if the Y axis went down to $0, and you switched to GH/s instead of MH/s. How do you get it to 990? Did you modify the bios?Turn the fan speeds up.
Yeah, no wonder he wants to call it a "trade secret". He'd catch a lot of flack for building inefficient miners. There's nothing special about those builds. There are hundreds of people on this forum that could build better systems. ROFL. You think you have some magic sauce on building mining rigs that no one else has figured out?Really? You don't think the owners of the company have a right to know what they are buying? Wow. Steer clear of this investment. It's only going to get worse. When he starts getting hardware failures, and doesn't come clean, things are going to go downhill fast. Good luck with that.https://clearcoin.appspot.com/escrowI was too harsh in my first reply. Clearcoin is an excellent option for buyers, but only in the non-donate option. Had this transaction been using Clearcoin, all the buyers would get their coins back. Stay far away from sellers that require the donate option. Once the coins are in donation-escrow and the seller backs out, like this one did, the only way the buyer can get the coins back is to release them to the seller. That's exactly what a scamming seller wants!!! Clearcoin doesn't solve anything. Both buyers and sellers can scam the other using Clearcoin. This appears to be a nice way to tie one computer to multiple pools. Can this also aggregate multiple computers together so I can see the status on all my GPUs across all my computers? My guess is you have no interest in trying to reproduce the 680 MH/s (also verified by jgraham), because they significantly reduce your claimed benefits. Where? All the mining has mined all the coins. You can turn your miners off now. You misspelled that. The correct spelling is W-I-N-D-O-W-S boxes. Nothing else. I'm quite pleased with the MtGox->Dwolla->Bank Account transfer. It take a few days to get Dwolla all setup, but once that's done, then the conversion from BTC all the way to USD is quite easy and quick.Now that the Dwolla fee is only $.25, the .65% MtGox fee is looking enormous. Sorry, nobody "knows" it will be +15% tomorrow. What everybody does know is the value can go up and down. With that uncertainty, trading bitcoins for cash/services/goods/etc. does make sense.I don't see any shortage of threads in the Marketplace forum. So even in today's environment, it is happening all over the world. Huh? Of course people are using it for goods and services. Over 1,000,000 bitcoins have traded on MtGox in the past 30 days. I'd say that's a very healthy amount of circulation on a single exchange. That doesn't count all the other OTC/business/etc trades that are also going on. I'm interested, but not sure how clearcoin works. Are you suggesting I send my coins to clearcoin, they hold onto them, and then I wait for you to send me the cards. If the cards never show up, how do I get my coins back? ROFL. Cray jumped the shark when they decided to use Windows on their HPCs. Wouldn't running a miner on a VM only slow things down? Why not run a bare-metal always-free Linux miner? Any chance of getting a kernel optimized for the 6xxx series? Is the value of a penny based on the cost to produce the penny? No. Is the value of gold based on the cost to mine the gold? No.So why do you assume the value of bitcoins will be equal to the cost to produce them? The value of bitcoins are based mainly on supply and demand. Well I guess my problem isn't due to running headless. When I boot with a monitor and see X (Ubuntu Desktop 10.10) up and running, I still can't aticonfig over ssh. The three lines didn't help either. Let me toss out some rough numbers. Please correct me if I'm too far off.You have about 300 chips doing 200 MHash/s? That's 60 GHash/s you brought online? While that probably puts you in as one of the top miners, that's not a significant cause for the recent network growth.For someone without piles of existing fpgas sitting around idle: If purchased new, that's $250k in hardware costs bringing in $10k per week in bitcoin value. Half a year to pay off the initial investment (assuming price/difficulty growth remains steady). GPUs would break even in less than half that time.
I have a much simpler setup, but I am mining headless successfully (no monitor, keyboard, or mouse plugged in at all). What I can't do is aticonfig. It complains about X not running. Do I have to hack up the /etc/init scripts to get X running without a monitor plugged in? calculator, 7825 mhps = 24 hrs/blockdeepbit.net, 7825 mhps = 45 coins per day50 * .9 = 45Ok, if you look at it that way, it is 10%.So how about reducing the fee, say, to 5%? deepbit.net, 8695 mhps = 50 coins/dayhttp://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php8695 mhps = 21 hours, 31 minutes = 55.77 coins/daydeepbit.net fee ~11%. Good work on the new features. I haven't yet found a set of DiabloMiner options to beat Phoenix, but it's definitely neck-and-neck now. DiabloMiner is much easy to install and configure, so that's a big bonus.Another donation on its way to you. Nicely working pool. Now that you're ~700 GH/s, what do you think about dropping the huge 10% PPS fee? That solution looks like a very beautiful and expensive solution. If you've seen the typical rigs around this place, price/performance is what matters. Not how cute the hardware looks. I would love to see your cost estimates on that thing. 681 with stock everything. 830 MH/s, etc. You're kidding, right?http://www.bitcoinrigs.com/products/Enthusiast-Rig.htmlDual 5870, 760 mhps = $1400http://bitcoinsystems.com/1652.htmlSingle 6970, 300 mhps = $1500With BitcoinRigs you get double the hashrate at a lower cost.Suggestion: Drop your prices in half. I didn't have the optimal Phoenix settings before. And I was rounding down. Here's an actual shot:681.06 I optimized my Phoenix settings for my 6990 and installed the new 11.4 driver. At stock card settings I now get 680 MH/s, which compares very favorably with your 683 MH/s using 11.3. I have yet to try the downgrade to 11.1 trick. $150 for a $6 flash drive loaded with some open source software? No, that doesn't sound reasonable. I think I got 2 extra MH/s from downclocking the memory. Everything else is stock. Very interesting downgrading Catalyst. Using Catalyst 11.3 and Phoenix I get 670 Mhash/s vs. your 683 Mhash/s. Sounds to me that hdminer is only 2% faster, and that the bulk of your performance improvements are in system configuration, and not miner optimizations. How about BFI_INT support? That sounds like the main feature that is holding DiabloMiner back performance-wise. With Phoenix on a straight stock 6990 I get 670 mhps. So this miner requires you to run multiple instances for multi-gpu configurations? Why not just use all available devices by default? That is your estimate of what may happen. That is not, today, a cheaper deal.270? What happened to 245? Ah, I misunderstood.So 1 Gh/s generates 326.7 BTC at today's difficulty. Those 2 are offering 326.7 BTC for the cost of about 280 BTC. Nice deals!331 BTC on the other hand sounds way too high. You should update the FAQ in the first post. You no longer are offering a cheaper deal. I think you need to look at your calculations again. Your prices for your competitors USD/BTC are incorrect. bitcoinrigs.com model is far superior, with a larger power supply and room for a third video card. That alone is worth far more than "free shipping".Or compare their dual 5870 to your single 6990. The dual 5870 will hash faster and is $600 cheaper!
Can you get over 550 mhps? So if I go to http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx and select HD 6990 I see only Windows drivers. That's not fully supported, now is it? There are significant problems with the 11.3 driver, especially relating to OpenCL. So unless you plan on Open Sourcing your CAL miner, stop telling people that 11.3 is "fully supported". Nice idea. I hope someone posts back with their results. Of course it is legal. Bitcoin is hardly the only virtual currency around. Details? Miner, OS, Driver versions, etc. Yes, very disappointing. I get about 275 per gpu with both 11.3 and 11.4b on my 6990s using DiabloMiner, all stock clocks/etc. I hoping for something more like 350. What's the hashrate on the 6990, and which miner? What catalyst 11.4 Linux driver? I am now. I installed dual 6990s and did a fresh install of Win7, Catalyst 11.4, Stream 2.4, and latest DiabloMiner with '-f 1'. 4 Caymans are found but hashrate is poking along at under 700 mhps. Anybody with Win7 and a 6990 running DiabloMiner? I installed Catalyst 11.4, and while DiabloMiner runs, the GPU activity level barely gets above 80%, and thus my hashrate is poor. I threw Win7/32bit on my box and it is slow as a dog. I hope 64bit is better. Linux is not an option for a 6990 rig. ATI has not released the Linux drivers yet. Price just jumped $.10. I wonder who is buying... Agreed. Buying that many coins on the open market is going to shoot the price straight through the roof. I say go for it!!! In two months when the price hits $5, I'll cash out, then a month later the price will settle back down to $1 and I'll buy back all my coins for a huge profit.Just one hangup ... Doesn't mtgox have a $1000/day withdrawal limit? I don't see how you could get that many coins out of mtgox in 2-4 months. Outclassed by a factor of 10. Code redeemed. Thanks. Actually, bitcoin pretty much solves this problem. The reason there's so much fraud is because there is no private key with credit cards, bank accounts, etc. Whenever you use your credit card, anyone can take that number and use it again as much as they want.With bitcoin, I can make a payment to anyone, and no one will ever be able to use that address to take anything from me.Here, I'll show you. Here's my bitcoin address 1H8KtBi9tFtD2vKhNaY9NV5Tbe4rLm4267. Now you post your credit card number and let's see what happens. By different you mean, willing to pay a 50% fee to participate in the pool.Stick with CoinCard. Their "little cut" is literally quite little. And that's a good thing. Are you comparing a 5970 to a 6970? Because the 5970 will absolutely crush the 6970. Good deal, I'll take one. PM me an address.
Stop right there. First, miners don't charge fees. They either include txs or they don't.For this to even be possible, there would have to be so many txs that they don't all fit in a block. That would be thousands of txs every 10 minutes. That is in the very distant future. And again, miners don't charge fees. If there are so many txs that they don't all fit in a block, they'll just pick the txs with the largest fees. This "smaller transaction fee" situation makes no sense. He's selling "mining capacity", implying that they are new coins like BitcoinRigs and vladimir. If he's doing something else, I want to know.A typical service converts bitcoins to something else, or something else to bitcoins. A service that converts bitcoins to bitcoins? That sounds like a laundering service. Is that what's being offered?Mined coins are anonymous and untraceable. Buying on the open market is risky and complicated. Is this the tx?http://blockexplorer.com/t/2kPyoU2jj8I see no reason there would be a fee required on that tx. Where are you seeing .82? I'm seeing .88 and up on MtGox.Are you guaranteeing truly minted coins, or are you just sending the same coins back to the buyer?And what is the point in converting Bitcoins into Bitcoins? I can see the point in leasing hardware to convert Dollars to Bitcoins. Right. It doesn't matter what your nonce is. You could start at 1 and increment by 3. You could start at 10000000 and decrement by 17. Every attempted nonce has the same chance of "cracking the block". They're going to have to have bitcoind running somewhere if they want to use the coins they were sent.That just defeats the purpose of a peer-to-peer currency. Those merchants might as well just use any number of centrally controlled ecurrencies. You all have cheap electricity!$.40/kwh here in California. I would put intakes on the side of the case, with exhaust fans in front, back, and top. Nope, mining isn't profitable anymore. You can all stop mining now. I have an Amazon Prime membership. An Amazon card would be really nice option. How does openssh-server work if you are behind a firewall? What makes you think that? My 5870s pull about 340 mhps, and my 6970 pulls about 320 mhps. The difference is likely attributed to the slower drivers needed to support the 6xxx series. So for 1031Â£ you can get 1188 BTC worth about 622Â£.Wow.  No they're not. This will not work with GPU mining. Look around for all the other threads on how to install the drivers/sdk for ATI hardware. I'll stand up for wb3. His command of English is far too good to be Baron.As for Gox, I trust him enough to do an occasional buy/sell of some bitcoins, but I do not trust him enough to keep any funds in his control for more than a few minutes. Let me point to one big Eve scam (there's probably more) as an example.http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=381340Gox could one day close all accounts and there would be absolutely nothing any of you could do about it. Sounds like a great deal. I'll take it. PMing you.Edit: gift card received promptly. Nice doing business with you. No. I sure hope not. Having dealt with Visa/PP/etc chargebacks that stiff merchants, one of the key benefits of bitcoin in my opinion is their 1-way nature with no chargebacks. "Tainted" bitcoins just make more victims from an already bad situation. http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php says you'll wait on average 8 days 8 hours for a block at the current difficulty level. Someone just unclogged the drain:http://blockexplorer.com/b/111264
Ok, that makes sense. Changing the pool payouts would mitigate it, but people could still end up with fragmented wallets for any number of other reasons. How about a feature in the client to consolidate one's wallet. It would bundle up many of the small wallets and send them to itself. I really dislike the idea of changing the rules at this point. That sounds like the pool needs to do it differently, not the network. If this is a pool payout to 500 people in a single transaction, then the pool needs to break it down into smaller transactions. I sent a few regular transactions yesterday and they were immediately included in solved blocks. What, using a bunch of used parts off ebay? 5970s are too expensive and hard to get to build a dual-rig for under 1400 using new parts. And now with the difficulty at 55590.23763914, 1Ghps gives 18 BTC/day, at a cost of $23/day. That's about $1.28 per BTC, when the open market is selling them for about $.95. Kudos for finding buyers at such a premium price! With '-f 1' after a few hours it's definitely settled in for a nice hash rate. It swings maybe +/- 5%. Quite acceptable. Ok, it's not crossfire related. Even with a single card my hashes are all over the map, unlike my other system. It must be driver versions. Cdecker, how do you get the data for those graphs?DiabloD3, "-f 1" definitely improves my hash-rate, but it still swings wildly. Typically between 300M and 350M, but also way below 300M from time to time. I'll try turning off crossfire and see if it improves. With dual cards, my hash/sec are all over the place. It never settles in to a steady rate. (running locally) This is the key point right here:Due to the way hashes are essentially random, it doesn't matter if you switch before completing work. My 5770 was pulling about 15 MH/s until I set "-w 64", then it goes back to the expected 150 MH/s. The python-pyopencl package depends on the Nvidia drivers, which conflict with the ATI OpenCL drivers. So these instructions will not work on ATI. No, sorry. The Intel graphics you have won't work.
