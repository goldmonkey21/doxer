That look HILARIOUS, or AWESOME.EU. Yes, but it would vary depending on whether you're in the US, or in the EU, etc. I find myself craving a knitting project at present, and I figured that an incentive would be useful, so I offer the Bitcoin community:Knitted ScarvesI can knit a pleasant ribbed scarf of a colour of your choosing, and send it to you via mail within a month. Shipping costs may vary based on your location, since the scarf will be knitted in the EU.In short:250 BTC + shipping BTC for one 1.4m coloured scarf using rib stichAny takers?
