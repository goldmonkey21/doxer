Just out of curiosity - what if I had to exchange large amount of cash, say few thousands of $, for bitcoins and then send them to my friend who will have to exchange them back to cash - would this be possible? If I'm understanding this correctly volume of daily exchange is only about few dozen bucks, so, is is possible to exchange larger amounts of money?
