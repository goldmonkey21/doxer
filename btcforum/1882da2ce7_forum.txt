I have made a BIP Proposal,  To help protect against transaction replay attacks.  Would love to gather some comments.Code:<pre>  BIP: ???  Layer: Consensus (soft fork)  Title: Strong Anti-Replay via Coinbase Transactions  Author: Cameron Garnham <da2ce7 at gmail.com>  Comments-Summary: No comments yet.  Comments-URI: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-???  Status: Draft  Type: Standards Track  Created: 2017-03-25  License: BSD-3-Clause           CC0-1.0</pre>==Abstract==This document specifies a soft fork that enables users to make transactions with a strong expectation that such transactions cannot be replayed on a different chain.Important Note: In the case that an adversary hard-fork, the strong guarantee of non-replayabilty via this BIP may not be supported.==Definitions====Motivation==In the case of a chain split, it is important to protect users from, potentially significant, loss of funds from transaction replay attacks.==Specification==Upon activation of the soft-fork (activation methodology undefined in this proposal), the following new rules become activated on the Bitcoin Network.New anti-replay OpCode.  Take an unused NoOp and redefine it as OP_ANTI_REPLAY.The script must only have the form:scriptPubKey: (empty)scriptSig: OP_ANTI_REPLAYOP_ANTI_REPLAY has the following specification:  OP_ANTI_REPLAY outputs must only be created in a coinbase transaction.  OP_ANTI_REPLAY coinbase outputs must only have the value of 1 Satoshi.  Transaction must not included more than 1 OP_ANTI_REPLAY input.  If a OP_ANTI_REPLAY input is included in a transaction, the transaction must also be marked as Opt-In-RBF (BIP 125).The Bitcoin Network should maintain a total of exactly 100 000 OP_ANTI_REPLAY outputs, with the exception of the the first 99 blocks after activation of this soft fork.Upon activation of this soft fork.  Every blocks coinbase transaction will be required to create exactly 1000 new OP_ANTI_REPLAY outputs, up to the total of 100 000.If a OP_ANTI_REPLAY is spent in a block, a corresponding new OP_ANTI_REPLAY must be included in the same block.It is recommend the miners account the size of a OP_ANTI_REPLAY transaction as:  transactions size + size of a OP_ANTI_REPLAY output in coinbase.In the case of an chain split after this BIP has activated, miners should recycle all the OP_ANTI_REPLAY outputs via spending and recreating them in new blocks.  Renewing the protection to the new chain.=== Reference implementation ===To-Be-Implemented==Backwards Compatibility==This deployment is compatible with all existing bitcoin software.Upon activation, all deployed Bitcoin Full Nodes will enforce the anti-replay projections for Bitcoin Users. (Only upgraded nodes will enforce the other OP_ANTI_REPLAY requirements).==Rationale==The only know way of guaranteeing that a transaction cannot be replayed is to include an input that cannot exist, by-definition, on the alternative chain.  Coinbase transactions are the only transaction type that is know to exhibit this property strongly.This BIP makes it convenient for wallets to automate the inclusion of new coinbase inputs into transactions that spend potentially repayable transactions.  Everything in this BIP could be done manually by close cooperation between the users and miners, however the author thinks that it is preferable to have it well-defined and enforced.On Opt-In-RBF enforcement:  In the case of conflicting spends of OP_ANTI_REPLAY outputs, the higher-fee transaction should take priority.  Wallets may select a random OP_ANTI_REPLAY, then check if the competing transaction has a sufficiently low fee to be replaced.It is expected that every OP_ANTI_REPLAY output will be in the memory pools waiting to be spend; users must compete for this resource.==Future Questions==SegWit Compatibility?==References==Opt-In-RBF:  https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki==Copyright==This document is dual licensed as BSD 3-clause, and Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal.Mailing List Post: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-March/013777.html Any sane UASF will use a flag-day for the activation. UASF is a wonderful tool in today's bitcoin political environment, I have no reason to believe it is unsafe and will not work as specified. UASF isn't as safe as when you you have a coperative miner upgrade. However we don't have coperative miners (or at lest don't have a majorty or coperative miners).  UASF becomes very reasonable in this unfortunalte state; as it removes controll from the miners hands.Of course it is better to do a miner-based upgrade, however this option, in this politcal enviroment, is not reasonable. One distant day. (Tho the forum software seems to be still in active development). I can undersand that you are not a coder; as a coder would notice that the Epochtalk forum software has been split up into modules and most of the development no-longer happens in the core module.Please see:https://github.com/epochtalk/ @AliceGoredI must admit that going through your history it is clear that you are far, far, more technically and intellectually competent than either Roger, or your average large-blocker.It would be wise for others to take care when responding to you.Not that I necessarily agree with what you say. Thank-you for your well-written response; I've updated the title in correction.This is a very interesting view on the matter; one that wasn't at-all represented in Roger's essay.When the mining is centralized, or quite a small group running it; it is easy for the miners to voluntary set their own limit via cartel. Hopefully, mining doesn't remain so centralized and it will gradually become reasonable for new entrants to join the mining market once the mining hardware efficiency has hit hard technical limits.Requiring the use of a cartel to set block size limits, (that are applicable to the mining cartel), locks in the mining and node structure we have now.  As there is a strong competitive advantage for centralizing and having large blocks.As a user of Bitcoin, I quite like that my node enforces the blocksize limit; I would be very upset for this consensus power to be taken away from me and given to the miners (cartel).Of course, this is a huge detour from the status quo, the burden of evidence is on the proponents who wish to make such a change.Thank you for this piece of correction.  I really should have said minimum relay fee-paying transactions; not non-zero fee transactions.You can see in the average blocksize charts (for example, when looking when Bitcoin had the 'stress test') that virtually every minimum relay fee-paying transaction has been included by the miners (until recently when blocks finally became full).The core of my argument still stands, the seen behaviour that miners have been including all transactions that have complied with the minimum-fee-policy that Bitcoin Core has set. I dont see any reason why this should stop at 2mb or 100mb. The miners generally just use the default policy that Bitcoin Core sets; One would expect the miners to get greedier for fees when fees become a larger % of their revenue.1. What!? What does that mean?  The fee curve in bitcoin is flat.  That means that there is very little price discovery for fees; and that most people don't even care about the required fees. (seen by people often overpaying a huge amount for no gain).The reason that the fee-curve is flat; is that the minimum relay and inclusion policies do not allow it to be developed at the lower fee ranges.If there was very strong demand, and therefore competition, for the block space, what you would see is many levels of fees.  Say. 8c, 10c, 15c, 30c.  That would all have different expected functionally (average confirmation time).Yet, now there is really just two levels: (minimum relay), and 8c, immediately confirm.This, economically, suggests that blocks are not saturated (for real-fee paying users), and that there is very little economic pressure for more transactions to be included.2. What!? Again. This is a half-truth.  Yes, there are economic use-cases that are placed outside the market from 8c fees. But that says nothing for the economic importance of such transactions. Well, it at least says that the said economic use-cases are not economically significant enough to competitively pay 8c transaction fees.Using the blockchain for storage is a potential use case if the fees were insanely low; but thankfully they are not.3. It is up to the person promoting the change to explain why this change doesnt upset the status quo.  It is completely fair to expect a understanding of how blocks are going to be paid for by fees; if the block-size is very large.It is also reasonable to expect that the blocksize (2MB) that Roger is promoting is the thin edge of the wedge; as he has promoted bigger blocks before on many occasions. The question of the long-term viability of Bitcoin under huge blocks is implicitly at hand. Hello, many here know of Roger's essay published on the reputable website of the Foundation for Economic Education:https://fee.org/articles/time-to-end-the-block-size-blockade/I wrote a considered response to Roger's essay, however, unfortunately, I have not had any response, either from Roger; or from the community at-large. Hence I'm kindly asking for some commentary / responses from the people here on this forum. In particular, are there any part of my post that are wrong, invalid, or misleading?Original Reddit Post Here Look at his username:I think this gives the 'why' away. The last archive is from 13 Sep 2015 02:57:12 UTCIf you try archiving now you get:https://archive.is/JdGDe For example:archival of:https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/would be quite nice, it is full of all sorts of juicy posts. Agreed, however there is lots of content on that site that should be kept for future evidence. - It would be great if somebody did a dump of the entire forum. I was trying to archive some posts on the other "Bitcoin Forum" and quickly found out that is explicitly an disallowed action.https://bitco.in/robots.txtCode:User-agent: ia_archiverDisallow: /User-agent: *Disallow: /designertest/Disallow: /forum/attachments/Disallow: /forum/forums/*/?directionDisallow: /forum/forums/*/?orderDisallow: /forum/help/Disallow: /forum/login/Disallow: /forum/lost-password/Disallow: /forum/members/Disallow: /forum/misc/Disallow: /forum/online/Disallow: /forum/posts/Disallow: /forum/register/Disallow: /forum/search/What is more interesting is that the owners of the "bitco.in forum" have taken the time to explicitly block the archival site: https://archive.is/For a site that claims: Well Well. What do we have here? This thread has been a lulzy! In Summary:Über Evil Blockstream Core have done *something* evil; and Gavin (and his Super-Hero sidekicks) has swept in with is multi-aborted fetus of blocksize increases to save the day!The problem is that this (dead, rotten, stinking) blocksize increase fetus is starting to get so fowl that even places like Reddit are starting to get a unsavoury taste in their mouths when it is presented as a viable option; yet again.---The mailing list on the other hand...https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-February/012369.htmlWell.  Lets just say that if this was a game of football; nobody is watching it for the contest anymore. I hope that it is at-least as readable as this forum. The default theme for SMF (that Bitcoin Talk Uses) is very clean clear. Using borders and different shading between posts is nice on the eyes. and we thought that the XT train was lulzy...   @brg444https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increasesI think that this topic is officially over.Now may be a good time to close this thread, but what a fun ride it has been! Then you go and read what Gavin says:where he also says:http://gavinandresen.ninja/segregated-witness-is-coolie: "Segregated Witness is cool, but I'm smarter than Pieter Wuille and know what is the most important priorities for Bitcoin."Gavin posted his "Segregated Witness is Cool" after...@gmaxwell famous mailing list post:https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.htmlGavin then replies with this somewhat uninformed reply on the mailing list:https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011877.htmlThat basically says: "I'm not as smart as Pieter, so I'll just say that his solution "will just complicate consensus-critical code" (using a soft fork)."It is my hypothesis that Gavin is using flax technical issues as a political wedge.Now, I'm a brave man, but I'm not brave enough to go out in public saying that Pieter Wuille is wrong on a technical choice for Bitcoin. Instead, if I was concerned with a particular set of engineering choices I would first ask him to state is reasoning for that particular choice. Where I would be no-doubt appeased.Gavin and Co' just go out like lol-cows stating how their way of engineering Bitcoin is so much superior; They have never asked "Could you please explain your reasoning for this choice", rather they state something like: "It is much better to do it my way".Hence, this is my main argument that they are using technical issues for political purposes; as they seem to have no desire to learn - They pick the contrary on any possible technical decision, and then use it as a argument for 'compromise'.here is a little humor for you all:Gavin / Mike:  We must scale Bitcoin or it will fail!!! We cannot have full blocks.Core Dev: We are busy trying to make Bitcoin not fail right now! Thank God Block are not full! - No increasing the Block size doesn't solve this issueMiners: There is NO WAY we would accept 20MB!Gavin: Ok, I've talked with the miners, they say that they will 'agree' with 8MB blocks!Core Dev: NO! Go Away: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6341Gavin / Mike + Trolls: "The Core Developers don't care about the future of Bitcoin!!!!!!!111"Gavin / Mike:  We love Bitcoin, use XT + BIP101 !!!!!... (huge Bitcoin culture war is created) ...... (Mike officially becomes a LOLCOW on the mailing list) ...Miners: There is NO WAY we would accept any of BIP101Gavin:  BIP 101 is dead! But I still know how to scale Bitcoin Best!!!!!111Core Dev: Um, no, why after all your past hair-brained ideas, suddenly you know what is best for all of us!?Gavin: We are going to find a compromise! I agree, if you are here for the 'content' then she was far more fun than usual grazing animals that inhabit here.  
of informed 'uninformed' negativity(take conspiracy hat off) I don't ignore many people on this forum, however MPOE-PR was a special kind of Lol Cow.  Except we all know that it is the same charlatans that have been pressuring the miners to include more transactions and create max-block-size blocks on average. - Who are also pressuring to increase the same max-block-size limit.So the argument about max-size vs actual-size is a bit of a moot-point, really. This dose nothing to alleviate the genuine concerns of Luke Jr, and other Bitcoin Engineers that have good evidence and reason to believe that the 750kb blocks that we have now are already hitting the block size scaling limits that the network can safely manage.People who propose such large blocks, such as 2mb or 4mb, never seem to address the concerns that the Bitcoin Network is *already* struggling under present loads. No, I don't think that you have got the analogy correct.The BIP101 / XT crew are proposing to change the 'Technical Specification' of the aircraft. This is a document that describes under what conditions the aircraft is safe to operate, including load-limits.Changing the 'Technical Specification' doesn't magically change what the aircraft is physically capable doing, it only changes how people will be inclined to use the aircraft.BIP101 doesn't change Bitcoin's wingspan or any other physical quality that *may* make it safe to operate at twice the load. It only changes the document that describes how to use the aircraft safely.This in itself isn't a bad thing; If the aircraft is overly conservatively specified, then updating the specification to reflect the actual capabilities of the aircraft is a prudent thing to do. - You want to of course maximize the utility of your aircraft.However with BIP101, they are proposing to adjust the aircraft specification without even much looking at testing a model aircraft under such loads in a air tunnel, much less making a full-sized copy for rigorous test flights.They are acting in complete disregard with established engineering concepts such as engineering safety factors, or conservative design specifications. - From a engineering point of view, those who propose BIP101 (or any other scaling proposal), without first showing scientific evidence and reasoning that such a proposal will be within the physical capabilities of the network, imho, are looking much like chumps.Of course when an aircraft crashes, it costs hundreds of lives. - Bitcoin, only billions of dollars. If you think of Bitcoin as an airplane, and the block size limit as the load-limit of the aircraft. -  The block-size debase makes much more sense.We are talking about changing the _technical_specification_ of the aircraft, not actually scaling the aircraft for greater loads.BIP101 and the other block size proposals do nothing to actually scale the Bitcoin infrastructure, the only talk about changing the specification for Bitcoin infrastructure.Of-course if you double the load-limit of a aircraft, it *may* still work, but if you double it again, it will probably fail in a spectacular manner.The real scaling dose happen, but it isn't lauded, it is the hard CS engineering that upgrade the engines, upgrade the fuselage, etc.Maybe having the engineers who maintain and build the aircraft setting the technical specification for what the aircraft is capable of safely handling is a prudent approach?Boeing doesn't have a public vote asking the public what the take-off-load-limt for their aircraft should be; neither should the Bitcoin community have such a vote for Bitcoin protocol. Indeed, for such systems the limits should be set very conservatively. You clearly have much reading and study to do on how bitcoin works.I hope that you take this opportunity to do some research so you don't look like either: you don't know what you are talking about. or shifting the goal-posts in your debates. Er. No.  If such an attack against XT as I described here:happened, then the Bitcoin XT nodes would be forever vulnerable, while the Bitcoin Core nodes would experience no loss in security.This is clearly not what happened in the previous forks. It cost the same 25BTC to make 1MB block or 8MB block.The difference is that if an attacker is trying to scam a example 200BTC double spend, then it is far more reliable and simple to do it against a XT node that would accept a 8MB block, while the rest of the network rejects it.Again, your posts show you don't understand the Bitcoin Security Threat Model very deeply at all. I'll save this quote in full to show at this date you didn't understand some basic double spend attacks.But I will explain this attack.Any XT node would could be tricked into accepting a block that an attacker KNEW would not confirm in the rest of the network.Any SPV miner may then mine on-top of your block blindly, creating a longer chain at a much cheaper price.Thus reducing the sybil requirements.The attacker could more cheaply and reliably make a longer false-chain, fooling a XT node into thinking that it has real confirmations. I'm saving this entire quote here for future reference to show that at this date you didn't understand the basic properties of block-version-numbers.However,Let me assure you that my previous statement is technically correct.  The Bitcoin Core uses would be completely unaware that the miners have fucked-over the Bitcoin XT nodes, and no money would be wasted in the Bitcoin Core world. Sure, however one of the best responses to shills is ridicule.To show how an XT shill's position is ridiculous, in a brain-dead-sad way, is an effective method of shifting the debate from technical matters (that are resoundingly resolved), to a tacit of mocking opposition being a absolute complete mockery. No BIP101 (as coded in Bitcoin XT) will activate when 75% of the blocks flag it.  The miners being honest or dishonest is not relevant.Bitcoin XT activation of BIP101 doesn't depend on "exchanges, payment processors, services ..." (or anything else).You are not correct with your statement.  For example, 76% of the miners may choose to fuck-over the Bitcoin XT nodes, by falsely flagging BIP101 -  Then opening up the XT nodes to cheap double spend attacks whenever they (or anyone) wants. Except for the unfortunate fact that Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin XT are mathematically mutually exclusive.Slightly off-topic, but ever wondered how you gain 'lolcow' points in the bitcoin technical community: look no further!https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6579 This part is quite true, he was working on Bitcoin Core, then switched to XT when his pull request was rejected:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6341History of Gavin's Pull Requests for Bitcoin Core:https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/pulls?q=author%3AgavinandresenYou can see how the Bitcoin Core > Bitcoin XT > Bitcoin Core chronological fits quite nicely.It also matches up very nicely with the aforementioned mailing list posts. I want to make it clear that I'm not suggesting that Gavin is a *bad actor*, I'm just supplying evidence to support my claim that Bitcoin XT is considered a laughing stock from the Bitcoin Technical Community.I do think that it is fair to suggest that Gavin was interested in Bitcoin XT more than Bitcoin Core for a period of time as Bitcoin XT accepted his BIP 101 pull requests. Well there was a period where he directly contributed to Bitcoin XT, providing a total of 5 pull requests:https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/pulls?q=author%3AgavinandresenFor the same period, other than promoting his BIP 101, he was notably very quite on the Bitcoin Core github.More recently he has become involved in many technical discussions over on the Bitcoin Core Github.I think that you can track the change after this particular message to the mailing list:https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-September/011220.htmlInstead of going the lolcow route (aka the one Mike Hearn took), Gavin has made a concerted effort to re-gain some trust in with the Bitcoin Development community.Oh and if you are wondering what the 'lolcow' post was. Here it is:https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-September/011304.html It is actually Sacha Baron Cohen in his publicity event for the movie Brüno. Quite a fitting profile picture for this forum, I think. The XT crew have made lowcows of themselves.  Even Gavin has moved back to working on Bitcoin Core (on github).It is kinda funny seeing Coinbase come out in support for XT, since the entire technical community has moved on.To make it short:XT is treated as joke. (in the technical community).    People cry for exponential expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem; then propose a linear increase in the blocksize as the "solution".   LN are no more of a learning curve than what Bitcoin was 4 years ago.In the case of a dispute, then the most resent tx is sent (with a big fee) to the Bitcoin network. LN work by constantly trading would-be-valid Bitcoin transactions, these transactions never need to go on the Bitcoin network unless one of the parties doesn't respond.In the case that one of the parties doesn't respond, then after a timeout, the latest Bitcoin tx is released on the network, spending both the anchors, and thus closing the channel. -  Everything was agreed upon up-to that point, so very little to Bitcoin was lost (maybe a few cents in fees).Think about it: it works in the opposite way to how things work atm:1. You go to the cafe, and buy a coffee with Bitcoin.2. The cafe gets a Bitcoin TX, and has to wait for a block for it to be confimed.3. Everything is settled after the tx is in the block chain. (about 10 min or more).(with lightning):1. You go to the cafe, and buy a coffee with LN.2. You update the anchor TX to the cafe, and send the updated TX to the cafe. (instant).3. No need for settlement since you come in every day.- See in the general case, nothing ever touches the blockchain. - there is no 'confirmation times'- Only in the case where there is disagreement dose the 'confirmation time' matter - only to resolve things back to the 'last known good state'.- It isn't possible to double-spend a LN transaction, since the lock time is longer than the time for the Cafe to release the last know tx.- if the Cafe goes out of business, then you can get your Bitcoin back, maybe after 6 weeks.  But you only put 20$ at a time, so this doesn't bother you so much.
Bitcoin will continue to work just fine without ever having a hard fork.For example X (window system) has 30years of backwards comparability, and still counting. - Backwards comparability is part of their user contract (note, this isn't a legal contract, rather just a contract that is kept by consensus by the Xorg developers).If we never reach consensus for hard-forking Bitcoin, this is ok. Even if 90% hard-fork, the remaining 10% can still successfully run a bitcoin network. - This would enter into a Bitcoin civil war.Another interesting fact is that is that is that Satoshi actually gets to decide what fork wins. People don't notice that in the case of a hard fork, Satoshi has a 1000000 BTC stake in both forks.  He can choose to sell his coins in one fork, buying more coins in the other. - This alone will dictate the winner of the fork.  So if Satoshi wants to stay at 1MB blocks - well nobody else can out-compete his economic power. In studying the implications of lighting networks, it quickly becomes apparent that they may be just as revolutionary as basic Bitcoin transactions themselves.If you view Bitcoin as a censorship resistant global settlement service, then it is logical to build systems that only go to settlement in the case of disagreement.In the future, I forsee the the Bitcoin network layer 0 will only be used in the cases of fowl play (for adjudication), and public audibility (such as proof of reserves).The future general case will be where transactions never even touch the Bitcoin network.Thus it is logical that optimising for scale over security for the layer 0 network is completely foolish.  The later 0 network will gain it's value from being exceptionally secure.Do you take the fact that the clerk at the the corner store failed to give you the correct change to the highest court in the land?- Well, no, in general this is not necessary.  However if all other forms of justice fail, there should be an avenue to take the dispute for final adjudication. Block-size "debate" summarized:Most Bitcoin tx are spamBlocks are getting fullMust increase block-size or transactions will get more expensive!? ? ? ?Profit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 Thank you! That was one of the most enjoyable posts I have read on this forum for quite a long time. Great Work on the new release!about fees:You support tickers such as USD and EUR.  Could it be possible (or reasonable) for there to be a ticker for 'fee-data' that could taken from a trusted (and signed) bitcoin full-node?Sure it could be hacked, however if there is reasonable hard-coded limits the only real hack is giving miners a few extra cents, or the transactions never confirming.I guess the 'too low fee' attack is more annoying that the 'slightly too high fee' attack.Full-RBF is going to solve all these issues, however that is a while off.edit: add complement for the new release. I lol'd https://blockchain.info/tx/f34b88041498b419ef4f9663be7f649c0bb548060095abaa49382eaf7b5931eb How about some more Greek memes?    wooo!!!sent some bits to: 18JwWGyMqgvkr7XbnUo23aAyHjR2bw2TDJ I'm going to give some bits to people who make some great meme images! Like mine here: https://twitter.com/da2ce7/status/615654069781200896I will give the bits out in any way I like.  But have fun! I've been closely following the debate, in-fact I even tried my hand at a proposal.I'm a very cautious man by nature. I first want to comment how the core development team has so-far done an underrepresented engineering work in computer science in keeping the Bitcoin network running.  This achievement should not be under-stated.  They have really done an remarkable job.Part of their success has been their extremely conservative nature. In the past, when changes have been rushed through, such as BIP 16 https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki , without full consideration of the proposed alternatives (BIP 17) https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0017.mediawiki we have found serious issues with them in hindsight.To quote:https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/34mrtj/eli5_why_is_peter_todd_important_and_why_do_some/Rushing important decisions is a fools game. A prudent person makes well informed and slow careful choices.I would much prefer to suffer the discomfort of transaction fees being a few more cents, than to rush a hard fork and fuck up the community (the most valuable thing that Bitcoin has).(From a Old Hat). While I'm moderately against just increasing the block size. (I think that we should sort out the rest of the hard engineering infrastructure so we can actually support larger blocks first).The main point is even on this forum we have nowhere near the 95%+ consensus that we need to do a hard-fork.Gavin's latest proposal is just dangerous with only needing 75% of the miners to agree.I would much prefer Bitcoin to continue to work with 1MB blocks, than be destroyed on the reckless quest for larger blocks. Quite frankly, the Bitcoin infrastructure isn't ready for another big rally just now.  But I think in 6 months this will be looking much more solid for a hard rally. The price of Bitcoin is dictated by it's scarcity. If half the number of bitcoins are traded at twice the price the liquidity stays the same. I believe one of the main reasons for the slow decline of the bitcoin prices is that people who wish to invest a large amount of money do not feel comfortable about securely storing a large amount of value.With BIP32 and TREZOR investors are starting to feel more confident that they can indeed manage holding their own Bitcoins.Once a significant proportion of investors move to such secure Bitcoin storage technologies I believe that the incentive to sell will become much diminished.I suspect that the in unofficial markets (such as Local Bitcoins and OTC) will be the first places to dry up in excess liquidity. (as in the average price on these markets will be higher than say on Bitstamp).When this happens, I believe significantly because of secure wallets, we will be officially at the start of the next major bull market. (it is important to remember that the bitcoin prices is dictated by people who do not spend bitcoins rather those who do).  If you wish to have additional exposure, you could compose and send an email to the the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. Great Work!   Have you picked a license for the code yet? Goodbye! (from a bitcointalk vagrant). These builds are out of date.The new version uses cmake, and is in super-heavy active development.https://github.com/Open-Transactions/opentxsMy old windows build system dosent work with it.  Really good analogy! (Except I would expect to see a deflationary collapse of the red-giant, before an hyperinflationary super-nova explosion.) At some price it only take as small amount of new money invested to keep the price afloat.Unless you expect that people are genuinely going to forget about Bitcoin and move on to something else...   In that case I would recommend you take your investment elsewhere and hold naked shorts on Bitcoin.However I don't see the 'core' interest in Bitcoin decreasing; instead I see a huge amount of the worlds most talented people building infrastructure to support and build the possibilities of what blockchain technology can provide.  Every month that goes past the Bitcoin infrastructure is in a better position to support a larger and larger popular movement into cypto.Over the years, I've seen the following cycles:1.  base infrastructure is developed to support a market.2.  popular investment movement into bitcoin.3.  infrastructure is over strained and hacks, companies collapse, and legal issues arise.4.  bitcoin price progressively collapses for the all-time highs.5.  the 'core' bitcoin community tirelessly work to build better infrastructure.6.  the cycle repeats.I believe we are the phase 4-5 phase as listed above.  At some point the infrastructure will become ready again, and the popular movement will overshoot the price again.  However maybe this time we will be looking it overshooting to $50 000, and retracing to $10 000.  I however suspect that the next cycle is going to be shorter, as the network effects at such such sizes are extremely powerful.So.  I don't know what will indeed happen... However there certainly are established adoption cycle pattens that are quite observable and tested.TLDL:  Have fun and and be ready to change your short position into a long.
I don't want the code to 're-written' but rather re-designed for modern C++ code.  Not just a wrapper on the existing zlib code. I am a experienced C++ programer, so I will, of course be following and checking the work. 20 BTC project.For an expert programer who has some spare time:I wish to commission a reimplementation of zlib in C++11.Not focused on performance.   Focus on safe, correct, and easy to ready code.  Should still be fast on a modern compiler.This implementation should take advantage of the new C++11 features.Include a C interface that is compatible with zlib.MIT style license.Edit:We are not looking for a good wrapper, but a ground up reimplementation, using modern code.This code only needs to compile with:  GCC 4.8, LLVM/clang 3.4, and MS Visual C++ 2013This code need to be supported: Linux, MacOS X Mavericks, and Windows 7 SP1 (and later).CMake build system +  Unit and Functional Tests.We advice to not to start work until we have confirmed a plan with you.please contact me at:  da2ce7 .. at .. gmail.com sorry guys, I have been traveling.  I will try and make a new build sometime soonish.  The error that Moneychagner cannot start is because of not packaging a QT dependency. There has been a huge amount of work on Open Transactions since the last build.  There may be quite abit of work to create another build.Cam. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10881213/The-coming-digital-anarchy.htmlThe best article on bitcoin I've read in the Mainstream media... ever. New Version.  0.92.c New Build.   OT 0.91.a for Windows (inc Moneychanger released!). We have completed quite a few changes under the hood.  Shall soon have a new release. Add my Bitcoin-OTC link to the first-page. And a stupid stupid error makes me release v4.    Should work now! Ok... lets try version 3... (just uploaded).You may need to remove you pid file.Load up Moneychanger in the console it will give you a better output. Updated it... Hope it will work now  New Release, including C++ QT Moneychanger!Woho! Checkout the OP! @oleganza, I recommend cross-posting to the bitcoin development mailing list for more commentary. really cool, watching.   wonderful speaking Gavin! you do yourself and the community proud! Let the Development & Technical Discussion root forum be about generic bitcoin technical issues.  Of Course.  It would be amazing to see a "I certify that I (Name) am the original creator of Bitcoin" by the origin's block key. Satoshi Nakamoto Reveal Himself? (no evidence of-course).http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8JuTMFuXuU@54min.Otherwise very good Video.
In light of the scale of this project I've updated my bounty to 2btc Bounty! (for Open Transaction Project)Port zlibc to zlibc++ and earn Bitcoin!Rules.1. Github project with good documentation.2. Autotools compile on many platforms.3. 'make check' with comprehensive unit tests and functional tests.License:  (same as zlib): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib_LicenseISO C++03 strict compliance code, no warnings compile with GCC and clang.Good luck!Randy and Fellow Traveler (and of course myself) are going to be on the review board for this project.Pledges:da2ce7: 2.0BTCrandy: 0.2BTCany questions/comments please comment on this thread.Or on IRC: #opentransactions  on freenode.net Thank-you for your reply's.I've made an updated release of Open Transactions for windows. (0.89.q)The test-data is available for download here:https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/archive/master.zipYou need to copy it into the %APPDATA%/OpenTransactions dir.You will also need to run the otserver.exe  Will be super fun!  cannot wait! @moltenmichSent 2btcd88007128db7a915c142dbc494b3c34c4f58cddcee12a04b6e0cb687fa0ee7c5 wow...    well I think that we have,  moltenmich, who is way ahead of everyone else  love your logo! So who are the winners???  I need some addresses to post the BTC to!!! @moltenmichThe blue-globe one is winning so-far:If there is no new entry, we may close the competition early.  PM me if you are still working on something. @moltenmich, great work so farNot to pre-judge, however I love this one: Unfortunately, even large raster images will not be accepted for the bounty.  We need clean SVG files, (or Illustrator). Over in Open Transactions land, we are finding ourselves in need of a Logo.So in true Bitcoin fashion, we are having a competition!Rules:Must have two versions: Greyscale and Colour (must look good in both).Must be in a Vector Graphics format.(optional) a banner version.This competition will be open for at-least 2 weeks, or until we have found a great logo.The prize pool is 2btc atm.  People are welcome to donate more to: 1D9eWaBqawJH4KUb5frWpwZtzkuSZEMnG3Happy drawing.Judges: markm, FellowTraveler, da2ce7Edit: All Submissions must be under a http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ licence.  (of course, we will still try and credit the artist where possible) While Bitcoin was small, a low-importance transactions were fine, as the entire network size was small.  However as the network increases in size, so must the 'importance' of the transactions.  Otherwise it becomes disappointingly costly to maintain the network -> thus, creating great economic incentives to centralize the network.If, for example, fees are LINEARLY related to Network-Size, then the cost of maintaining the network will be LINEAR * LOG (number of unspent outputs).  Or just LINERAR, if you have an unlimited amount of random access storage (eg. RAM).  This is a sustainable proposition. (The fees will pay for the cost of running a node).The position argued, by some, is that the cost to make a transaction on the Bitcoin network should be CONSTANT.  This means that the cost to run a node on the network (while maintaining the same quality of decentralization); will be increasing faster than the amount of fees, per node.  -> Thus creating an economic situation, where either:  Nodes are subsidized, or the ratio or full nodes vs. uses goes down.I, personalty, value a very decentralized and non subsidized processing network of Bitcoin full-nodes, more than the utility advantage of having low importance transactions. This conceptual argument I take issue with:The very security model of Bitcoin requires there be multitude of full nodes, unless, if there was only one full-node, then non-bitcoin transactions could be possibly slipped in (unaware to SPV nodes).For the current standard of decentralization to hold, we need a constant ratio of full nodes vs users.  Having only a few full nodes is a very much a higher-trust security model than what the Bitcoin Network currently provides.People who advocate a high tpc, must necessarily, advocate a more centralized full-node processing network.  (Because of the QUADRATIC cost of maintaining the decentralization). Update to Version 0.89.f   While there are some elements of Bitcoin that may be used for microtransactions; I do not believe that it is rational to suggest that Bitcoin-itself is designed for microtransactions.It comes down to maths.The cost to check the inputs of a transaction is:O log(total number of unspent outputs).The cost of checking any one transaction is:O (number of full nodes) * (cost of checking a transaction).The cost of growing the network with a constant number of transactions per user is:O (number of users) * (cost of the network checking the transaction)For a constant ratio between users and, full nodes (so we can maintain the decentralization of the network). It can be shown that:The cost of verifying the Bitcoin Network of any given network size (number of users), for a constant number of transactions and full verifying nodes per user is: QUADRATIC.orCost of Verifying the Transactions of the Bitcoin network = O (network size in users)^2 * log(number of unspent outputs)Where we assume: Constant number of transactions per user, and a constant ratio of users and full verifying nodes.This is why I will re-iterate, that Bitcoin was NOT designed for large-scale microtransactions.EDIT: fixed, from CUBIC to QUADRATIC. (thanks amiller). I suggest that if it was 700tps running a full node would be prohibitively expensive, and commonly, only fat-cat banksters would run them. I think that you miss the point, if you are having small transactions, they SHOULD NOT be audited by everyone in the world (or at least those who use Bitcoin).  The time-importance of small transactions is much lower than of high-powered-money transactions.For-example, I could make a merge-mined chain that works like Bitcoin, where the value of any coins older 6 weeks is halved. (and forgotten once they get smaller than the smaller unit).  New miners would sell these coins, and people could trade over medium time periods.  (purchasing and selling this temporary currency for bitcoin).  However this is just one option that I made up then.  There is a multitude of possible merge-mined coins that could be developed.However the key point, is that the whole world should not care about my transaction of going to the corner store and buying a coke.  Only transactions that are significant for everyone should be audited by everyone.  7tps seems like a good rate.Open Transactions works completely differently to Bitcoin, they are in-fact extremely complementary.  They solve different problems.  Bitcoin solves the 'low-trust, everyone audits, value transfer.'  Open Transaction solves the problem 'anything that is related to something in the world should be able to be traded'. If Bitcoin becomes popular, then people will not mind paying eqv. $100 in fees for buying a house.  When a house is 0.01 BTC.7tpc is enough.  Let Bitcoin be the high-powered-money.  Not play money that you use at the corner store.We can create any number of merge-mined chains for any number of other transactions.  These chains can be optimized for the particular purpose that they fulfill.  They can even be dominated in BTC (with clever escrow-bitcoin-look-up).I for one would love to only have 7tpc. This would mean that it would be easy for everyone to audit the high powered money.  (we would know what the bankers are doing with our cash).  In-fact in 10 years, my mobile phone may be able to audit the entire chain. (with some dedicated cypto hardware).On another note, merge-mined chains that fulfill other purposes will make the main Bitcoin chain more secure. So it is a win-win. DATE, TITLE DATE TITLE

I would assume as many as the MultiBit, or Electrum forum.  I think that having an Open Transactions sub-forum would be great!Since the latest post from FellowTraveler: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=212490.0 I think that this topic has become a whole lot more relevant to the Bitcoin community. It would be really cool if some more people could ACK this proposal in Meta:'Open Transactions' subforum in Project Development Update to version v0.89.a   I think that it is a very endearing quality to have.  Rat poison when you have a plague of rats can become quite valuable. I think that it is great, it is simple enough for mum and dad to understand. Best Video on Bitcoin so far. I think!http://www.abc.net.au/btn/story/s3744569.htm    The Builds includes the OT Command Line Prompt: Updated!New Major Version: v0.89.aFellowTraveler has been busy!!Lots of changes, including support for smart contracts!I've fixed some bugs in the paths code so the script locations are detected more reliably, and some other various bug-fixes. For my releases of OT for windows; I contained both in my post:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77301.0 The Open Transactions related topics in Alternative clients have been moved to the Project Development forum.  This move is reasonable in itself, however the Project Development is much larger, and the OT related topics are getting lost easily.Can we please have a Open Transactions sub-forum within the Project Development forum.  I am willing to moderate it.Otherwise, maybe a generic 'Software' sub-forum would work.   If you post the SHA256 has of your new releases on the forum. that is far more trivial to check than PGP.  (of course your forum account could be attacked, however at-least it is one more step for an attacker to take). Of all the GUI IRC clients, I strongly recommend kvirc:http://www.kvirc.net/At-least on Windows and Linux; I'm not so sure if it is the best for MacOSX.@Jim,  It  is important that you:1. Connect via SSL2. Register a username.3. Set 'ENFORCE' for you username (so other people cannot masquerade as you)3. Authenticate via SASL (kvirc has built-in support for this).4. Get a IP cloak. (so you don't tell it to everyone, opening yourself to attack).I'll set the Channel-server to automatically voice you if you are logged in. I'm sure he would be great if speaking French.  His command of written English is great... maybe next time there is somebody wanting to do an interview, have a translator. I've setup the #multibit channel on freenode.net If you wish, please join and hang out in this channel to provide support.   Yep, about that.  It is hard to say everything clear and simple.

It is the miss-allocated resources,  from the manipulation of the monetary supply. This is the huge cost to society. I was quoted in it.  It was in the print edition as-well, however a slightly shorted version. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/bitcoin-fervour-goes-viral/story-fn7j19iv-1226615233325news.com.au link (without the paywall):http://www.news.com.au/national-news/victoria/bitcoin-fervour-goes-viral/story-fndo4cq1-1226615233325 making progress! If bitcoin starts eating the world, it is people like Felix that will demand that the government stops it. It may be better to write a new gui that replaces the bitcoin-QT client.Since Windows 8 (and windows phone  supports C++ now.   wow lumos! Welcome to Bitcointalk.   with the kitty so large, I think that it would be a good service to make it required that the code is released, with an open-source friendly licence.   what version of mutibit do you have, the wallet is stored in standard places. So you should be able to find it still.If you find you wallet, you should be able to recover it with https://blockchain.info/wallet/ I've updated to version 0.88.k 500/70 ~= 7/1 In the General or the Politics forums. update link:  but no bitcoin address?  https://defcadcom.wufoo.com/forms/defcad-crowdfunding/ Completely wrong.  0.8 had the bug, since it didn't imperilment the protocol as defined by the 0.7 clients.  The fact that the limitation in the 0.7 clients was unknown and undocumented is besides the point.The absolute thing that 0.8 needs to do is not allow blocks that are considered invalid under 0.7 clients.  (no-matter how, or why they are considered invalid).This is was an "Undocumented regression of the 0.8 client"  nothing more, nothing less.  The fact that it comes about from a "undocumented limitation of the 0.7 (and before) clients" is besides the point. in-fact the amount of energy required is quite a calculable problem.  The problem lies in the answer, where the energy is greater than all the energy in the universe. Except it isn't just me, there are hundreds of users (and owners of bitcoin) like me, who signed on to a system that we thought would have LOWER relative costs to verify in the future.  That one day every, even the cheapest computer, could become a full-node.The thing is that these people don't post on the forums about this change.  Because they are not arguing FOR a change. They are quite happy with bitcoin is atm.They don't even need to be convinced about the change.  Their Bitcoin; the current Bitcoin; the real Bitcoin.  Will continue to work just fine. That isn't the point either.  The fact is that my nodes will continue to run quite fine; rejecting your blocks.  I will be using bitcoin, and you will be using some alt-rule-chain that I don't consider to be bitcoin.My coins will be spendable in both chains.  The thing is that if 10% (or even 1%) of the Bitcoin USERS do not accept the change, the change will not happen: because the economic consequences will be too-large.We are not working in a democracy here.  We are working with a "do what the you want, but I'm not going to change my code mkay."For this change to be successful, the bar isn't 50%, or 90%, or 99%, but rather closer to 99.9%. But, for such a change, even 1% can veto it... That is what makes Bitcoin so great!  The economic problems caused by 1% forking makes it not worth for the 99% to implement the change.
YAY! I see the block size (and frequency) as much as economic rules as the total number of coin is.  I disagree with Satoshi that it is just something that we can 'change.'I'm part of that sticky group of people that WILL NOT accept a larger block size.  I doesn't matter what other people say; or the reasons that they give.  Frankly, I would reject (with my full node, and SPV nodes) any non-bitcoin chain.  Any block breaking the 1mb/10min avg limit will not be a bitcoin for me.However I am not worried.  I know that Bitcoin will be just fine with a 1mb block limit; as MarkM so eloquently put is, we need to get over having only one chain, but rarther think of having a ecosystem of hundreds of merge-mined chains that all fullfill different roles.One of the reasons, (there are many), that I work on Open Transactions is that I believe that we need secure and cryptographically auditable off-chain transactions.  Making the need for more than 7tx/s on the Bitcoin block chain much (completely?) negated.The best part is that I am in control of this problem.  Even if every other person moves to larger (or more frequent) blocks, I know my bitcoins are safe, and for-me bitcoin will keep-on working. (well other than the attack of a drastic lower hash-rate maybe)So yes, I think that there is AT LEAST a key 10% of the Bitcoin user population (including me) that will veto any such changes. still very low volume:  Like!  I think that the wiki dose a pretty good job at it...  However we need to be more active in moving over content from the forum to the wiki. http://news.slashdot.org/story/13/02/17/0846255/mega-accepts-bitcoin-email-chat-voice-video-mobile-coming-soon Just wanted to say that cypherdoc's subscription is excellent.  I would highly recommend people to subscribe to his insights.   I want a button like facebook or google plus so I can 'like' comments.   Lets not get ahead of ourselves here.  I expect that we will have a multi-layered system the vast majority of the transactions being made off-chain.Additionally; who is to say that one wouldn't want to verify their house transaction with a smart-phone.People completely mis-judge the free-market.   If you have to use alt-chains because the fees are so high, well isn't that a success of bitcoin already!  By no stage has bitcoin failed then.The argument for larger blocks is VALID for a proticol that isn't Bitcoin.  However it is a catch 22, for Bitcoin.  It only becomes a problem if Bitcoin is a success.  If Bitcoin is a success, by definition it isn't a problem. http://www.esecurityplanet.com/patches/oracle-responds-to-java-security-flaws-with-50-fixes.htmlIf you are on windows, go to Programs and Features, uninstall all "Java".If you still need java you can get the latest version from here:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html Jeweller, thank you for your great questions, Ill endeavour to answer them.First I wish to point out that that I believe that a bitcoin-like protocol that has no block-size limit. Where the miners choose the best block based upon two factors: block size and difficulty, would be still economically secure. I suggest miners would orphan blocks that are too-large (thus too-expensive to maintain). (The network would find some sort of equilibrium).If I was to pull out the continuous issue here:Max_Block_Size is both a network and economic issue.Changing the max block size has real economic consequences that can be split into two areas:  Fees and Uses.Fees:While I dont think that the network needs a low Max_Block_Size to remain secure, that shouldnt be up to my own analysis.  People may have invested into Bitcoin because they believe the 1MB limit to be the value required to maintain a secure network.We don't know if Bitcoin had a different limit if they would have invested in the first place OR NOT.Uses:In 10-years, a modern smartphone/computer will be able to run the full processing node if the Max_Block_Size remains 1MB.  This is a clear economic benefit for Bitcoin: Decentralized Bitcoin verification.  In fact in a few years, virtually every computer will be able to process the entire blockchain without issue thus making Bitcoin extremely unique in the realm of payments.We don't know if Bitcoin had a different limit if they would have invested in the first place OR NOT.So I believe that the Max_Block_Size is clearly a moral issue, more than a practical issue.  Just like the Maximum Bitcoins, or Generation Rates.Keep on using the smaller chain.  Although I could double spend my coins in the larger chain for my own benefit.Yes.If it is better for my purposes than Bitcoin I would move over.  However I believe that the network effect will be that bitcoin is always my first store of value.  Cool I'll keep a lookout for it!  This is a very interesting game-theory question.I have done some preliminary analysis of the problem and have found that gmaxwell may not be correct on this assertion.  (I used to support the razing of the max block size limit; however I now reject it on moral ground.  The same moral grounds that I would reject any change of the number of coins; that it would make any past uses of the protocol under a false pretence)Now I will try and explain why a bitcoin-like protocol could be secure without the max-block-size limit.The core issue is the mixing up cost-to-attack with active hash rate, when in the long run they separate to be quite independent qualities.   While the vast majority of the miners income is from mining blocks for new bitcoin; there happens to be a very strong causation, this causation doesnt need to hold.The first thing that we can define is the damage cost of double spends this cost can be modelled defined by the equation:cost = time x valuetime: real number between 0 and 1A double spend a long time after a transaction, for a large amount is a very costly (up to the full cost of the tx).In the free-market, in the long term, the market will sustain any fraud rate that is less than the cost of reducing it.  (aka, it is cheaper to buy insurance than to increase the difficulty of an attack).I see no reason why a bitcoin-like protocol wouldn't be subjected to the same principles:  The network will spend the absolute minimum on maintaining its security. (Either via hashing or via insurance).So what is the cheapest form of network security? Dynamic response to threats.Bitcoin miners incur virtually no cost; unless they are actively mining.  Bitcoin insurance companies could amass huge collections of bitcoin miners and turn them on when it is cheaper for them to out-mine the double-spend than pay the insurance out.The bitcoin network will look quite easy to attack; well until you try and attack it.This will raise the COST TO ATTACK (that is a constant); while the COST TO DEFEND is at a minimum; only the minimum number of miners are turned on to defend the chain when it is attacked.Otherwise a background mining operation will be run by bitcoin companies for general network health. This has been discussed again and again.  This is a hard-limit in the protocol, changing it is as hard as changing the total number of coins... ie. virtually impossible.Many people have invested into Bitcoin under the pretence that the hard-limits of the protocol do not change.Even if a super-majority wanted the change.  A significant amount of people (myself included) will reject the chain.  Thus creating a fork. Stupid people do stupid things. (like ban drugs). This forum is great! Just make sure you make liberal use of the 'ignore' feature. mmm bayb, look at that spread    In fact, I believe that this forum is at the highest quality it has been for a long, long, time.  Unlike the bitcoinica and mybitcoin times.
I think that the root Development & Technical Discussion should be for general protocol discussions.We should have a sub-forum for Bitcoin-QT, BitcoinJ, cBitcoin, etc...As well as Electrum, MultiBit, etc... Oh, this is the cheif reason why we haven't seen rich investors build very large GPU farms:  Because they don't want an investment that will be made redundant.ASIC miners do not have this characteristics.   Once a mining company can prove that they are not a scam.  I believe that they will be booked out for as many as they can make. if the chips (er devices) are indeed good      then I suspect that we will have a long and sustained rally as all the ASIC distributors come on-line.I believe many (rich) investors are holding back until they can:a: Invest heavily in ASIC mining. (to strengthen their Bitcoin Investment)b: Have confidence that Bitcoin will not be attacked via a malicious 51% attack (funded by a bank or government).As (A) happens more and more; (b) will happen more and more.  Thus investors will be happy to invest more and more.So I suspect the price to go up, and keep on going up.   signing a treaty doesn't mean shit, until it is enacted into local law.edit: I'm not a lawyer, so what I say means shit also. I do find it kind-of ironic that bitcoinj, electrum, bitcoin-qt, armory, et'all have all spent so much time on their own wallets.Then everyone is going to need to support the common HD Wallet format in the future to be relevant.But yes.  HD Wallets are very cool.Even in OT land we have been talking about supporting them. anodically, I believe the post quality has never been higher on bitcoin talk than now. I think that Bitpay is a bridge too-far.  Tony is a great guy. While I believe that insurance based network security services would naturally keep the network secure (while using the minimal amount of work).I general fall-in and agree with gmaxwell that this is a core economic rule, and should not be changed. (just like any other of bitcoin's economic rules, such as the block-reward).I also think that it is a non-issue. As one day solutions such as Open Transactions will provide secure off-chain transactions.  (and in the future we see Bitcoin transactions for the settlement between OT servers and issuers.) Large Multi-sig tx may wish yo have very large transactions.Say if we had a 'bitcoin bank' where 9K out of 10k shareholders have to vote to pass a motion? A quick fix for windows:Code:    public static Sha256Hash hashFileContents(File f) throws IOException {        // Lame implementation that just reads the entire file into RAM.

The first round of this will be 'internet flora.'  The plants that grow on the internet.  Providing simple functions.Over time I expect them to evolve and grow up.   One day we may even have internet fauna.  That will be amazing. However I can only dream about it in my lifetime. You can always defend yourself, or have friends, family, or other people to defend you from aggressive attack.  However if you opponent is truly strong there isn't much you can do.  Incendiary, this is the case with the government, that is such a strong opponent that it is impossible to defend yourself from it's attacks; thus you submit to it's authority. (or go down in a blazing fight). This is a post by Phillip Rahvin, I saved it because I was sure it was going to be lost in time:--- ---[on Social Contacts:]Oh, I have too many opinions about this. Thanks for the excuse to rant.The social contract is not a contract.Contracts contain four elements: offer, meeting of the minds (negotiation), acceptance, and consideration (trade). There is no offer or meeting of the minds because the laws are unilaterally, arbitrarily dictated down upon people. There is no acceptance. The social contract is enacted by force. If someone disagrees with the laws and acts upon their disagreement then they are taken away to a prison. If they resist, they are killed. Contracts cannot be coercively formed or else they are invalid.There is no consideration. Consideration is those things which are traded in a contract, usually money for some good or service. When the State taxes people for a good or service they always include the disclaimer that they are not legally obligated to provide it. For example, people are taxed for social security for their entire working lives. Yet, people have been denied their social security benefits under the Supreme Court case Flemming v. Nestor which states that the government is not contractually obligated to provide social security benefits. People are taxed for police services and told that it is for their protection. Yet, the Supreme Court cases Bowers v. DeVito and DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services state respectively that the government is not obligated to provide police services and that even when the police services are provided that the police are not obligated to protect the citizens. Also, contracts can be dissolved once one party breaks the terms. Consider that political candidates routinely commit fraud by lying. Presidents use drugs and then continue to support drug prohibition and prison upon others. Law enforcers routinely break the law and behave as criminals. People cannot be expected to abide by a social contract if the State, which imposes the contract, itself refuses to abide by the terms of the contract. By the definitions of a contract, the social contract cannot apply.Next, is a historical argument. As is rightfully stated in the Declaration of Independence, government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed. If an individual does not consent to be governed, then the government does not have just power over him. As such, individuals have the right to opt out of the State's rule. The knee-jerk response to this is usually represented by the standard Socratic social contract argument, Well, if you don't like it then leave.That is really an incredible statement coming from supporters of the U.S. Government considering the history of the U.S.'s formation as found in the Declaration of Independence. It is widely acknowledged that the Revolutionary War was both just and moral. As such, it is highly celebrated. The revolutionists did not leave the geographic area when they rejected the king. It was quite the opposite. They kept their claims to the land and killed their oppressors. It has already been recognized that the consent of the governed can be withdrawn independently of geographic bounds. It would be hypocritical to say that it is acceptable for the country to be founded by withdrawing consent to be governed while retaining claims to the land and then say that it is unacceptable for others to do exactly the same thing to the government that set the precedent. As a side note, this does bring to light the fatal flaw of the founding fathers who are usually regarded in high esteem. After advocating that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed and violently rebelling from an oppressive regime, the very first thing they did was to impose a constitution and a federal government upon their neighbors who objected to and did not consent to be ruled by such. These actions make the founding fathers some of the biggest hypocrites in history as they engaged in exactly the same evil behaviors to which they so vehemently rejected.The social contract is immoral. Individuals are the sole owners of their own bodies, their actions, and the effects of their actions in the form of their property. To reject this claim is to advocate the belief that everyone else owns at least some part of every individual. The social contract serves as this excuse for social control; but, in reality, regardless of how numerous or how powerful they may be, others have no moral claim to own anyone's property, their actions, or their body because humans cannot own each other. The notion of human ownership is the essence of the social contract and where one party, in this case society, exercises non-consensual control over those around them. Humankind has advanced to the point where everyone recognizes these kinds of actions to be immoral when performed by an individual. The next step is to recognize that these actions are immoral when performed in the name of the State which only gains its power from groups of individuals. Just like I cannot grant my consent to allow your life to be violated, society cannot grant its collective consent to allow others' lives to be violated.And lastly, the idea of a social contract is just ridiculous. Imagine a contract under which a person can bind someone else's unborn children according to their rules and monetary obligations. This contract would be laughable. The child would not have to vote to change the system or leave his home to be unbound by this contract. The contract would be unenforceable because it is immoral. It does not and cannot legitimately exist. Yet, groups of people do this through the State where they bind unborn generations to their constitutions and laws and pass onto them sovereign debt obligations. Then when the children oppose these conditions they are told that they are bound by a social contract and if they do not like it then they must either vote to change it (with futility) or they must leave. As can be seen, there is substantial hypocrisy between the acceptable actions of individuals and the actions of collective individuals who call themselves a government. People cannot create a collective social contract when they cannot morally form exactly the same kind of contract individually. We're also told that we're born into society and therefore into the social contract. Last time I checked, minors under the age of 18 cannot be bound by contracts.--- ---I hope that you found this post great! Gives people lots of Ammunition to refute the entire 'Social Contract' concept. Well I've ended up making a clone of your branch:https://code.google.com/r/da2ce7-bitcoinj/source/list?name=jimthis has my own patches to it. (and I've rebased it upon the google/bitcoinj latest head). Bugfix for bitcoinj on windows:https://code.google.com/r/da2ce7-bitcoinj/source/detail?r=45641ba50c090a82e48b1d0e901191e4eb185a51 where is com.google.bitcoin.crypto ?I cannot find it either in Bitcoinj or Multibit. That isn't technically true.  If the reserve bank issues out less debt than what is expiring. (aka getting repaid). The total monetary supply will be contracting.  If the total value in the economy is not contracting at the same rate there will be deflation.This is why deflation is such a bad thing in a debt based federal reserve system.  If such a system enters a deflationary period; everyone has to fight each other for the remaining money to pay off their debt. (thus destroying the money, and removing it from circulation).Since the amount of debt is significantly larger than the available money.  This will force many many people to sell, and that will take value out of the productive economy.  A $1M debt is $1M no matter how much $1 buys.With bitcoin... If bitcoin goes into a deflationary period.  When debt is repaid, that money is still free to used again. (not destroyed, like with debt-based fiat).  Additionally, the cost of experiences are generally liquid, when the value of bitcoin goes up, the cost of expected expenses goes down proportionally.  This is the key reason why deflation has no (negative) effect on bitcoin. not that there is not good stuff:DNB: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9KghSdpGn4Dubstep: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGXvQJXVzTk

I've been reading the https://github.com/jim618/multibit/tree/v0.5 branch.  As the v0.5-bitcoinj-0.7 wasn't stable for me. Because I understand it! I enjoy reading it!It is neat, logical, and well-thought-out.This means that your code is easily extendible. I've been really enjoying reading through the Multibit 5.0 code today.

I am simply stating what I believe.I regard anyone who would accept aggressive violence as moral as a sociopath. Yes we all hangout on IRC Install guides are here:https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/tree/master/docsDebian (or Ubuntu):https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-Debian_Ubuntu.txtFedora:https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-Fedora.txtWindows:https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-Windows.txtMacOS:https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-OSX-Homebrew.txt Firstly, I'm sorry that presenting such ideas makes you ill.  As I'm quite healthy; I can only make the assumption that you, cunicula, are sick.See, this is why you have such a problem with 'libertarians' is that they reject the core of your argument on moral grounds.  They unmask you as a sociopath.You hold a fundamentally incompatible premise:Aggressive violence is reasonable if it leads to better economic outcomes.While an Austrian would hold:No economic outcome is reasonable if it makes use of institutionalised aggressive violenceSince you dont believe in the non-aggression principle; you show that you dont restrict yourself to moral thinking.  That you believe that any means is justified by the end.Being moral is an end in itself. There is no requirement for an economic reason. The philosophy that such an action is moral is enough.Austrians (and libertarians) do not believe that the end justifies the means!  They believe that how you get to an outcome is critically important.  They want to create a environment that is healthy, so that good and healthy fruit can be grown. The analogy between the difference between physics and mathematics; to Krugman and Austrian holds.Praxeology is based upon the belief that some things cannot be adequately explained by trend fitting; as a trend only fits, until it doesnt anymore.  Praxeology tries to explain the reasons behind why such actions take place; thus can make predictions what could happen in the future.Austrians core is two-fold; it is based upon a set of philosophical axioms that dont need to be empirically tested. (By definition you dont need to test a philosophical axiom!)  The heart of the Austrians philosophy is that humans should enter in voluntary relationships; that the institutionalisation of aggressive violence is always bad; no-matter the said productive outcomes of such a policy.  It is not a question if a society would be more or less economically efficient with such policies.  All policies that require aggressive violence are not even considered as available (said moral) options.Austrians then take the second step to explain why, (not just philosophically), but economically, voluntary interaction leads to the economically most efficient society.  Thus is built upon philosophical axioms, and makes use of logic and reason.  None of this is REQUIRED to be empirically tested. Why.   The same reason why mathematics doesnt need to be empirically tested: Proofs.Overall this has nothing to do with theology as that is the formal the study of Gods interaction with humanity and this world.  Theology is externally focused.  Philosophy is internally focused.
It should be unbelievable that a perfectly valid business model of providing an exchange service for bitcoin bushiness can be shut down by people threatening to put you in jail...

Fixed a bug.new version: https://github.com/downloads/da2ce7/Moneychanger/da2ce7-Moneychanger-00.12.03-Win32_x64.7z Ok...  New Version of Moneychanger.There isn't all-that much visible changed from the end-user prospective... However there has been massive changes to the API backed.Hopefully soon I will complete the C++ high-level api.  After that, making a great GUI for OT will be much more feasible.  Well anyway it is uploaded here:https://github.com/da2ce7/Moneychanger/downloadsda2ce7-Moneychanger-00.12.02-Win32_x64.7z Only the issuer needs to have any block chain bulk, so the Asset Issuer ID, the Bitcoin Address -  are the same thing.Over in Open Transactions land there has been talk about integrating something similar to killerstorm's (kthbye) colour coined idea.Here is the pastebin (I wrote, randy copy edited):http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=ygVyaBPLIt involves a non-trivial amount of work...  However it will make OT and Bitcoin fundamentally interchangeable!

Wait-out with your cash sitting on the exchanges...  soon after the difficulty shoots right up.... start buying. Meetup is tonight!!!   Hello etotheipi I'm one of the developers of Open Transactions;  I am primarily an C++ Windows developer.I have been looking at your siwg interface and native code, and I think that I will try and clean it up a bit for windows at-least.You may want to see how we have managed our Open Transactions swig interface:https://github.com/da2ce7/Open-Transactions/tree/master/swigI'm thinking about doing something similar for Armory... hmm. Less than 1 Week!! https://www.facebook.com/events/449291858445619/ Ideally something like BitcoinQT, a cross-platform QT client.  The next big project first is the proting of the chaiscript high-level api, to C++.  Once that is built, building a C++ GUI should be trivial. Two New Melbourne Meetups:Melbourne Meetup - Wednesday, 24st October 2012! More Info:  https://www.facebook.com/events/449291858445619/ Melbourne Meetup - Wednesday, 5th December 2012!

You don't have all the boost-parts needed.  Try installing libboost-all-devThis is because of Chaiscript updating and using more of boost.  We haven't updated our guides yet.
The:Code:"OTAPI_Wrap::" (something) "Null:" (something) "passed in!"Errors are from the new C++ API.I have made the API assert on all the bad data that Moneychanger sends to it.Edit: (well not all bad data, just on the obvious things like providing null for a required argument).For the most case, it just involves tracking down the calling function ad putting better argument testing before deciding to call the native command or not.(aka, if we are about to send an argument with a 'null' value... don't; return false without calling the command).I'll soon release an updated version of Moneychanger that corrects (more) of these issues.  But overall it is a good thing.  If you supply a function with bad arguments it should assert and exit.Edit:  If you download Netbeans, and use Git, the Java code should be trivial enough for virtually anyone to fix. (Java is much easier than C++, at least for the beginner programmer.  (I prefer C++ but it indeed take much longer to learn than Java).

Yes that what I mean by being against disproportional punishments.  However there are other recourses available; such as I outlined.  A thief will be charged with trespass the second they enter that shop.  Stealing would mean that you would also loose your reputation.maybe if we had proportional punishments reputation would be valued much more?  I'm not trying to argue IF copyright should be legal construct or not.  What I'm arguing is 'given that copyright exists' what is the maximum moral punishment for breaking the said laws.It is a different issue entirely if copyright should exist or not. I'm using 7-zip 9.28 alpha [64-bit]; if that helps.Hmm... at-least the hashes match  Hmm...Just tested https://github.com/downloads/da2ce7/Moneychanger/da2ce7-Moneychanger-00.10.07.7zWith WinRar, it worked fine.Also make sure that the file has downloaded correctly.It's File-hash should beSHA256(da2ce7-Moneychanger-00.10.07.7z)= a75fdaf96339abbb04a9f39df940aad1227f0ed1e76870b8b7b1db02d5ba885d I just believe that (waves hands in the air) "cost to society" is a reasonable way to calculate damages.Damages should be calculated by 'actual damage done' not "what would happen if everyone did this."   Disproportional punishments are fundamentally evil.If One uploaded a song.  They should need to prove that the person that obtained that copy would have bought it otherwise.  The actual damages is "the loss of a potential sale"  so the punishment should reflect that.  -  To make the two parties 'even'If you have a thief at a shop, the damages should be "loss of income to the shop" - if the item is returned unharmed, then there shouldn't be any punishment.  (well maybe some compensation for the loss of time of the shop staff).The way to stop that from happening in the future, is to ban that person from the shop.  Or ban that person from the entire shopping centre.  Charge them with trespassing in the future... (that should be the the cost of removing them from the property with using the minimum amount of force).Testing a law for disproportional punishments is a good way of testing it's morality.  If something cannot be enforced without extreme disproportional punishments then it most-probably shouldn't be illegal in the first place. (or society is attacking the problem form completely the wrong prospective).When tested Copyright is fundamentally unenforceable if the punishment fitted the crime.  Thus it sheds bad light on the entire copyright concept. Can you please tell me:What version of windows you are using.What version of Java you are using.If your  C:\Games\moneychanger\ directory is completely clean other than my latest release.Have you tried it with java x64 (if you are using a x64 version of windows)?as-well can you please paste bin the entire output. Hmm this is interesting... I haven't seen this particular error before. hmmm...
Or if they can control the bitcoin mining; refuse to send to a bitcoin address that is unauthorized, and will not confirm any transactions from unauthorized addresses. If copyright infringement was a real crime, it's punishment would be proportional to the damages done...The loss of a potential sale; One would need to prove (on balance) that you would have paid for that particular piece of information otherwise.Even if found guilty, the maximum punishment could only be as large as the market price of the item.The system that we have now of extreme disproportional punishment shows that the current copyright legislation is at-best evil. Can you please provide us with some feedback, such as the error outputs. The project is dead. However there is still an outstanding bounty I hold of 202 btc.The remainder should be checked with the pleaders, (including me), before being claimed.

Win32 or x64) Agreed, that is why I've been working on the windows version.  I think that if OT gets much more popular, then I'm sure somebody will build some windows builds with GCC 4.7 with mingw (like how bitcoin is built). maybe it would be better to replace the 'fraud' label.  Maybe replace it with the 'scamers' or 'community rejection' I guess if somebody wants to make mingw builds of OT they would work fine...  The OT Project is moving to C++x11 features, that are supported in the 4.6+ versions of GCC.However from Microsoft compilers, this restricts us to Vista (SP2) and 7 (SP1). new release!This one is the simplest release yet!  (check the OP) Windows Release:https://github.com/downloads/da2ce7/Moneychanger/da2ce7-Moneychanger-00.10.06.7zCode:-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----Version: GnuPG v2.0.19 (MingW32)owGbwMvMwCHIMl/GwHjr82uMp+OSGAISujN5uVISjZJTzXV98/NSK5MzEvPSU4t0DQz0DA30DMz0zKsUkgxSU02MUoyMDc2NktMsTc0TU0yNDEwtEpPMTU3SzNOSTdKMjYxME3m5MosV0vPzU/R4uXi5OuJYGAQ5GNhYmYC2dDJwcQrArDZOZfjN4nR/73brCb+fqR7tlxBfy5NXZJb+2HhL4MVLy78Yt7dEMPyzW9vK7ZBVMVvj5Yqsr4t3WJtKTG1Rn/Xq+4nztxqSIzwZAA===UbLX-----END PGP MESSAGE-----Hope everyone likes it!  Please report bugs.   yay we won! ** never Well I don't know how relevant Open Transactions is yet... We still need to develop it to a more stable state.However if any developers want to come and sail out onto the brave new waters of Open Transactions.  You are welcome to hang out in #opentransactions on Freenode.netaka... it would be really cool to have some more developers!   Our API is coming along leaps and bounds.    Ok. Ill try and explain it in simple English:There are generally 3 entities in every transaction: Alice (the seller)Bob (the seller)Trent (the exchange)Traditionally a double entry transaction would look like this.  (This is a transaction not a trade, so it is only one-way). It assumes there is another mirror transaction in reverse. Alice (I want to sell a car)Trent (I have found a buyer for this car)Bob (I want to buy a car)On Alices book:Alice (16  1)  Trent (+ 1 car)On Trents Book: (two separate entries)A:  Trent (500 + 1)  Alice ( 1 car)B:  Trent (501  1)  Bob (+ 1 car)On Bobs book:Bob (2 + 1 car)  Trent ( 1 car)There is no 3 entry; the transaction went from Alice to Bob via Trent.  However Only Trent has a transaction pair.With triple entry book-keeping this entire transaction would happen with ONE entry:Alice (I want to sell a car)Trent (I have found a buyer for this car)Bob (I want to buy a car)Trent learns that there is a transaction that matches.He creates an entry:Alice (16  1 car)  Bob (2 + 1 car)     and signs it (with a reference number).Trent then sends a copy of this entry to Alice.Alice signs it (agrees with the transaction), and sends it back to Trent.Trent then sends it to Bob, who also signs it (aka he also accepts the transaction).Then the fully signed entry is propagated throughout the relevant parties.It looks like:Alice (16  1 car)  Bob (2 + 1 car) Trent (agrees)  Alice (agrees)  Bob (agrees)Every party has the same copy.In much the same system is how Bitcoin works.Replace Trent with the blockchain;Replace Bob with a bitcoin address.  (That can only receive coins).And Replace Alice with a private key.Vola, you have Bitcoin. Both Bitcoin and Open Transactions use it: https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki/Triple-Signed-Receipts Maybe a little faith.edit: if they are going to be solved, the bitcoin community is the environment where it is going to happen. People freak-out about all the scams that happen.  I think that this is mostly growing pains.Over time the businesses and ventures that are well-run and reputable will grow larger, gain more loyal costumers, and extend their service.Scammers take advantage of the fact that people are coming from a very different financial world, and are very trusting mainly because: in the traditional world people with guns prosecute you if you scam.Having a higher power enforce laws is the simple solution to the problem.  However the problem with (the simple solution) is that it creates an environment that people want to escape (hence Bitcoin, and the turmoil of the traditional markets).The best solution, also happens to be the hardest: Build decentralized secure infrastructure, that has so much utility that people _choose_ to use it voluntarily over the less-secure options.This is why I said "Give It Time," in my previous post.  Secure Decentralized Networks are NP-Hard.  aka.  They are very difficult problems to tackle (hence why the violent simple solutions are so-often used).But, I'm optimistic, the Bitcoin Community is full of extremely smart and motivated people that love Bitcoin, and love solving hard problems.  Maybe some of them will have the inspiration to design and implement the novel infrastructure that we require.This is all growing pains.  If we continue to have the free-transfer of information. (speech and ideas, and in-essence Bitcoin itself).  I believe that the 'ZOMG Scammers' issue will start to fade away.If all else fails.  At least I'm one of the people working on the infrastructure.  Checkout the Open Transactions project:  https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions
If you were a noobie, maybe all this negative stuff would help you not get scammed so easily... wait...noobs still get scammed.Overall I think that It will improve with time; we are in the wild west, it takes people time to adjust from the padded rooms that they are used to. quote from Bitcoin Australia:  https://www.facebook.com/bitcoinaus/posts/101744956647407 +1 just a warning.... don't run random executables linked on this forum...   Maybe have flag icons, and little pictures, that show up also.(all this should be disabled, maybe with a 'hide my password' option also.) what you need is a password form with auto-complete.  So you start typing the word, and it will give suggestions, then press <tab> to auto-complete that word. Video by Adam Kokesh (http://www.adamvstheman.com/)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrDBq-c7ZrkHas some interesting information... Yes all pollies are slimy. pics or GTFO! Um you mean that both the Bitfloor and Pirate debacles are already priced into the market?  That sounds extremely rational to me. Ok I have worked out the error.I had a few things compiling as static libraries; while fine if your code is perfect; they hide many linker errors.   I changed of the projects in the solution to compile as DLLs, and cleaned up all the linker errors, (and warnings).  Bang-Presto.  It 'just worked'  So I have created a test-case, this is just 2 DLL files and a Managed exe file:https://github.com/da2ce7/MessagePassIt works fine, so it at-least shows that I was on the right idea originally;Yet, I am no closer to knowing why it crashes for OT. Well depending what I was compiling, the pure native parts I was compiling with no /clr  (eg. otlib.dll, otapi.dll)The Native/Managed interface, I compiled with: /clr (eg. otapicli.dll)The Pure Managed test-app I compiled with /clr:pure (eg. ot_clr_prompt.exe)The problem as far as I can tell is when linking the native dll's at runtime.  However debugging this is very difficult. Hello, I'm the main windows developer for Open Transactions:(don't know about Open Transactions check out my other thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77301.0)I need the help of a Windows API .NET CLI/C++ expert.I have been trying to develop a CLI/C++ interface for the OTAPI (Open Transactions API).  To allow any .NET developer easy access in calling OT functions.  (Without needing P/Invoke and Swig).I have got all the code compiling, without warnings.  I'm properly doing the __declspec(dllexport) and __declspec(dllimport) (afaict).However on execution, I'm getting the impossible to debug:(x64):(x86):When debugging the suspect code its: Code: (mcrtexe.cpp)#if defined (_MANAGED_MAIN)            mainret = main(arguments);   <-  the exception happens here.#else  /* defined (_MANAGED_MAIN) */However I'm finding it impossible to debug further.I'm compiling all the source code with the same mode: Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd) <- I even compile my own versions of ChaiScript, protobuf, and ZMQ, so be certain that they are using the same compiler settings.All of the DLL's seem to be linked properly, and I have been quite careful about the references.If anyone (maybe expert), wants to delve into this rabbit hole with me, and help, please checkout: https://github.com/da2ce7/Open-TransactionsI have full install setup instructions here: https://github.com/da2ce7/Open-Transactions/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-Windows.txtIn #opentransactions on freenode, I am regularly on-line as 'da2ce7.'I think that this features, if possible to get stable, will be a big boon for writing a OT GUI for windows.The suspect code files are:https://github.com/da2ce7/Open-Transactions/blob/master/project/ot_clr_prompt/ot_clr_prompt.cpp  <- my test CLI filehttps://github.com/da2ce7/Open-Transactions/blob/master/include/otapi/otapicli.h <- the CLI/C++ interface;https://github.com/da2ce7/Open-Transactions/blob/master/src/otapi/otapicli.cpp   <- the related cpp file.https://github.com/da2ce7/Open-Transactions/blob/master/include/otapi/OTAPI_Wrapper.h <- the native C++ interface.However I suppose this bug isn't so-much related to the code itself, but rather the build system.I'll even chip a few Bitcoins in the way of anyone who can help me solve this issue.    Ok I have worked out the error.I had a few things compiling as static libraries; while fine if your code is perfect; they hide many linker errors.   I changed of the projects in the solution to compile as DLLs, and cleaned up all the linker errors, (and warnings).  Bang-Presto.  It 'just worked'  neat!   Hey, I'm the guy making the current windows builds.The rational of the current builds is that Im including the full debugging symbols, and linking against the development version of the libraries.This will make finding bugs on windows far easier.  However in the future I will put more effort into making release windows builds.I can foresee at least 4 dependencies for the medium term, even with release mode:1.   MSVC 2008  (for OpenSSL)2.   OpenSSL3.   MSVC2010 SP1  (for Open Transactions)4.   Java (for Moneychanger)Of-course it should be possible to automate the install of the above mentioned dependencies, however this is not my development focus at the moment.It would be great for another developer to offer their time and experience to build such an install system.  Else, I will get around to it, and just let people suck it up with my debugging builds. Been working hard on replacing the c api with c++.Have finished the initial work:Budding programmers can make use of:https://github.com/da2ce7/Open-Transactions/blob/master/include/otapi/OTAPI_Wrapper.hand (basic, just bool, long, and string)https://github.com/da2ce7/Open-Transactions/blob/master/include/otapi/OTAPI_Basic.hSwig has been updated as-well:https://github.com/da2ce7/Open-Transactions/tree/master/swig/gluefor csharp, d, java, perl5, php, and python I'm going to work on next:  The high-level api...  (this is the one you will probably want to use).

We are not too far in supporting most of the actions that GLBSE supports!  All of them could be done with a little scripting. This is a large project, and will take a somebody dedicated to doing much research, thinking, creativity, and design.We are in the process of starting to build a Open Transactions website.  Our current wiki has some info, however there is much work to be done:https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wikiYou will be required to learn what and how Open Transactions works, so a background in technical understanding is a must.Upon conceptually learning Open Transactions, we would like a set of 10 to 15 slides, explaining through the eyes of a character, what OT is and how it works and in what ways it can make their life better.In many ways this is a perfect portfolio work, as the artist gets virtually complete creative control (we are only concerned that the facts are correct, not in the particular artistic style or character).If you have past work/ experience, or wish to do some concepts, please post below in this thread.Cam. Tonight! If you are in town! Meetup this Wednesday! https://www.facebook.com/events/263813007052408/ Bitcoin Meetup in Melbourne this Wednesday! https://www.facebook.com/events/263813007052408/ Sounds Like an exchange that I'd like to use.   just fold the bill in half when handling it.  (maybe write on the backside of the bill how much it is worth, in pencil.). Event-planned:Melbourne Bitcoin MeetupWednesday, 1 August 2012!Starts: 18:45Terra Rosa87 Flinders Lane, Melbourne VIC 3000https://www.facebook.com/events/263813007052408/ wise words. Anarcho-capitalism is a 'end goal'  just like any other political philosophy.  Since it is just 'nice' to have a 'pit in the sky goal.'  A group of clever people created Agorism, a methodology or personal/collective philosophy to get there.It deals with the fact that what we have atm is a very long way from freedom; and is systematic in the way to not 'attack' the current system. Just provide better market based infrastructure for people when the current systems inevitably starts falling on it's own sword.Edit: Another belief is that with the free-sharing of information, (aka, free-speech).  No oppressive power can maintain their power in the long-term.  n.b.  Bitcoin proves that money is just they transfer of 'value information' between people.  Banning bitcoin, would be to ban a form of speech between people.Edit2:  The 'natural state' of a society with Free-Speech; is Anarcho-capitalism.  It just take time to get there.  That is why it is inevitable that free-speech and thus the free-communication on the internet to be curtailed. (by anyone who uses force (or the credible threat of force) to maintain their power). make sure you use the git command:Code:git fetch --allbefore switching branches. Yes. This is the same as the one on my GitHub...https://github.com/da2ce7/Open-Transactionshttps://github.com/da2ce7/MoneychangerFellowTraveler hasn't merged my changes yet.
This is our new Build.  Many changes and fixes.Please Test! new build: https://github.com/downloads/da2ce7/Moneychanger/OpenTransactions_ab671dd_and_Moneychanger-8d5a001.7z It should strip any spaces in the address. send them to a bitcoin address called "coins_go_here_to_die" trash.  Please Delete. Death by Lolipop must be the gayest Bitcoin site ever!   You didn't set a "Password Image" on the Settings Window.Edit:The "Password Image" is any image file that you want.  It is shown when a password dialogue is shown... In the future it will be in an encrypted data file on your computer... @HostFat  New All-In-One Moneychanger Package is done!    Can you please show the output of:Load up command line:java -jar (moneychanger.jar) The passphase is 'test' In that case:C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\OpenTransactions\client_data\You will need to get the new version of the User Data in my OP.  As I found a bug in the old version. see: inside the user_data folder... There is a "server_data" folder... Copy that folder into the root of /roaming/OpenTransactionsHmm.... I really need to make a pictured install guide... You didn't copy over the user data.  See the OP.  It needs to be copied into the AppData/Roaming folder. Updated Version of Moneychanger... This update is mainly visual changes.  https://github.com/downloads/da2ce7/Moneychanger/Moneychanger-47447f5.jar Fixed a bug in the User Data... https://github.com/downloads/da2ce7/Open-Transactions/Open-Transactions_916224f_UserData_and_Scripts.7z Fixed some visual issues with Moneychanger...  Now it will be usable on lower resolution screens.     and Have made some pictures of Moneychanger in action!Settings Screen:Password with Image:Moneychanger Loaded:Exporting Cash:Depositing The Cash again:Well there we are!     Moneychanger is REALLY working on Windows! Oh yeah... Now everything is built with Unicode support!  *we there were a few bugs with zmq and OpenSSL. Big Update!          1.  Cash now works on windows!  (don't ask me how many bugs had to be squashed to get this working!!!)...2.  Configuration Files are auto-generated (you still need to copy over the user-data... however that now only includes the wallet and contract files).3.  Heaps of bug-fixes and work on scripting.... ot prompt is now included in this package.4.  Heaps of Upstream work from FellowTraveler!   My branch has been rebased against FT's master.  Overall, please test.... I think that we have got to the stage where it can almost be used for demonstration purposes!  Hmm... What is happening here...   Time to get out your shorts...  Or you are hopping on the short-bus?
That guy is so fucking fucking... why bother?     He isn't even good at trolling.  Who on earth would waste their time with these stupid videos.Also... DMC has been going very, cheap, on GLBSE.   By-far the best-value mining stock listed. But the US isn't getting rid of its debt. Just making it irrelevant via record-low bonds yeilds.  Later on, after 5years or so of virtually free debt. They can turn on the taps of inflation again, then this entire circus will start-over. when is the next dividend? Sending change to a new address becomes a non-issue when the client finally supports deterministic wallets.   There is worse thing you can do than holding USD atm.... I'm putting a bounty down for the creation of a QT client based upon libbitcoin.  (must be judged to be 'beta' by me).10btc. wow... a perfect gift!   Low Risk...p2p network enforcing the rules.Credible and extremely capable development team backing project.Bitcoin is lower risk than every other financial asset in existence.  However that says nothing about it's trading rate. +1 Oh yeah... Gettin paid... in _bitcoin_ is very hot. just wants to have sex... getting paid is a bonus!   Being careless is NO just deserve need for abuse.I'm sorry that you were treeted in such a foul manner.Please remember that this forum is full of trolls, scamers, and other internet low-life.But it is also full of some of the smartest, most balanced and reasonable people as-well.  Edit:: add NO Now that is a compliment!Even tho I disagree with 0% interest (it ignores the time-value of money).  For those who want to make use of it, sure. There is no problem with having your own rule, just dont force them on other people! Well at least Goomboo's sugestions are out in the public, so when BitcoinOPX's competitor is designing it's system they can implement them all.@BitcoinOPXYou would be very wise to take all of Goomboo's suggestions on-board... If there is one person on this forum to listen to, it is him.His trading advice has been instrumental in teaching people how to not-loose money when the market was more volatile.  I blame a large amount of the stabilization of the Bitcoin's price on his thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=60501.0 Bitcoin will find itself too-boring, and will one-day create more drama just so it can feel alive again. Hey, I miss you guys... Wish I could go!    Stuck here in AUS. Fairfax is low on news (editor strike).... and it shows. this thread is really retarded.    I somehow still don't understand this thread. You enter the ammount you want to trade. and then click buy or sell?  Maybe?
watching... and Bitcoin has been... Um... Boring. We have a thread on this forum for Open Transactions for windows:I'm always looking for more testers!https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77301.0 Experienced Java Programmer Wanted.https://github.com/da2ce7/MoneychangerMoneychaner is a test-client for Open Transactions.It makes use of the Open Transactions C++ libraries via SWIG.If/When Moneychanger crashes, or doesnt exit cleanly, a Java program is left running, and doesnt kill all the native swig code running.Is to make a java wrapper (programed in java), that launches Moneychanger as a sub-process; uses logger to log all the output from System.Err, and System.Out, and the 'native printf' commands.Detect when the Moneychanger program isn't running, and killing all of the sub processes, and finally exiting itself.The netbeans 'run project' system is quite similar.  When you stop a process with it, it will clean up every part of it.  This is open source, so maybe it will be only the matter of re-proposing it for Moneychanger.This is a Community Project, and is supported by donations.  While we will pay in Bitcoin, the compensation is mainly for encouragement for a programmer what wants to help-out without project anyway. Wow! That is really smart!  DMC is holds a position in other mining companies until it is ready to go ahead with it's main project.  DMC is a very good investment even before the IPO has been completed. Since that you have only got 1/1000 of your original IPO.  How are you planning to scale up the investment.Most of the shares bought on GLBSE are being offered for prices less-than the IPO price.Only once all of those shares are bought, then you will get more IPO investment. I agree.  Solar is too expensive.Edit:  The upfront cost of solar is very expensive.  Also you can only run your miners at day-time. Making the initial cost of the miners effectivly 50% more expensive.  Unless you decide to use both solar and paid electricity.  (maybe buy off-peak power, that is cheaper).  coolDon't use namecoin personalty, but support the concept! Also Fixed some bugs that made it not run properly on Windows XP.    Updated Windows Builds!     Now Compiling with Unicode; also updated to latest ChaiScript and ZeroMQ versions. @proudhon can you think of anything else that has looks like this? (in other markets) This is so good!  We need it in Australia!   Meetup was Great Fun!!!  We had great food.  LOTS of drinks.Hope more people will be able to make-it to the next one!We thought that it would be good to hold the next meetup in around 2 months.Thank-you for everyone who came! Happening Tonight!!!       Come along if you can make it!! Tonight!      https://www.facebook.com/events/345430765511234/ None of the ABC (Australia) website were popular enough to produce any more than a trivial amount of bitcoins. Think of it as a free cross-word puzzle while using your program! Tomorrow!      My Branch of Open Transactions now has Automake support!https://github.com/da2ce7/Open-Transactions/blob/master/Makefile.am Updated Builds... Hope they work better this time!
Yeah... I must admit.  I would be much more confable in using multibit if it used an deterministic wallet.  At-least, sipa has completed the BIP: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032  So should we have a 'who is the grizzliest bear' competition? http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/debt-crisis-live/9271371/Debt-crisis-live.htmlI think that we are going to have a messy week. Argentina, the mouse that sinks the boat? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=75059.0   The builds are out of date... Will be uploading new ones soon! Less than one week away!  If you know anyone in Melbourne who may want to come along to this meetup!! Please tell them about it!  Anyway,    Gotta start somewhere. Volumes are not that high yet... None of the walls have been 'eaten' yet.  Just manipulation. Yes!  Perl 6 is shaping to be the best thing since sliced bread!  I wish I had more time to help this project... However all my time is going to Open Transactions. The Bitcoin markets are pretending to be interesting again. The Bitcoin Challenge is a point-scoring game.  Once you have earned enough points you will be able to progress up a level and take-on more advanced challenges.The goal of this game is to get most points.This game is ongoing.Points are very useful: you can use them to brag that you have more points than other people.Points are scored by two factors, the number of people affected, the degree of how effected they are.  In general one point means one person has been affected by the task.Any violent or evil behaviour will result of loss of all your points and expulsion from this project.Most of the tasks are Bitcoin related, however some are just fun.Most of the tasks are In-Real-Life  Online tasks or tasks without direct human interaction generally score much lower.Small tasks are built-upon a honour system, just post in this thread that you have completed a certain tasks. Later, higher-scoring tasks will require peer verification and evidences of their completion.Every post needs to have the accounting for every task you have completed: such as:Code:[Points scored in Previous Levels]  0  (this is the first level)Task 1:  010Task 2:  001Task 3:  005Total:  16 pointsSome tasks can be completed as many times as one wishes, some tasks can only be done once per each user, and other tasks can only be done once by anyone. (these tasks are normally left for the higher levels, and are very high scoring.)This thread is of the level [First Days] the tasks in this level are always available for anyone in any level.  You will progress from this level once you have reached 10 points.In the higher levels it will be a requirement that you become part of a guild to complete the more difficult mandatory tasks.   Since this is of a higher level, the rules will be explained the thread of that level.Tasks: [Level: First Days <10 points]Trivial:0.1   Post in this thread your tipping address for tips on completed tasks.0.2   Print out a cool Bitcoin logo/slogan; put it in a public place.  Take photo.Super Easy:0.4   Call random contact in phone, have 5min catch-up and discuss Bitcoin.0.6   Talk to family member about Bitcoin.1   Talk about Bitcoin to somebody on public transport.1   Setup a Bitcoin wallet for a friend. Explain how Bitcoin works.2   When shopping at your local mall, strike up a Bitcoin related conversation with a random.3   Give a Bitcoin to everyone at a Family Gathering. (+ 0.5 per person above 5 people)Easy:10   Host a Tupperware Party style get-together for friends and family for more than 10 people.  (Instant level up) - Requires photos for evidence.Modifications/Multipliers:(optional)   Role Dice when talking in-person: 1.5x         Low (1,2,3) Comment on how nice they look.0x  3x      High (4,5,6) Sell them a Bitcoin, for taking your out for lunch, if no accept 0x. If accept 3xThis is the first level... Thus the tasks in this level are appropriately tame.  Expect more challenging tasks in the next levels.All tasks much have been completed AFTER the date of this post. That is such a shame that selling Bitcoin's is legally changing with Germany's draconian financial laws.I must comment that your site looks great, and has a great business case!Unfortunately I'm not in the position to invest in any websites.    However I can at-least wish you-guys great success.btw, your utip.it link isn't working. If zhoutong want to leave, good for him... Whatever he wants to do, may it be successful!His heart is in the right place! ElectricMucus...   just like linux has the tux... so bitcoin has the lama.Anyway... somebody make a competition thread... i'll chip in a few bitcoins.. Bitcoin Australia is having a meetup on Wednesday 1st August 2012 in Melbourne.We are going to a great tapas restaurant on Little Flinders called Terra Rossa.This meetup isn't going to be very formal.  While a few people will like to show off their Bitcoin projects (and other cool related projects), this will be done informally.  I will be brinig a few Casascius Physical Bitcoins as give ways.  Also I will be helping host the food.Bring your wallet, both your cash one, and your Bitcoin one... As it is very likely that you will be able to do some in-person trades.Since we are going to a good Melbourne restaurant, please dress smart.After finishing up at Terra Rossa we will be heading to E55 (55 Elizabeth Street) for the after-party.  This night will be having a selection of chilled breaks, beats, and drum-and-bass.Please come along, and invite friends.Also can you please either PM me that you will be attending, or respond to our Facebook event, particularly for catering purposes.For more info and RSVP: https://www.facebook.com/events/263813007052408/ So, some qualification I think is in order for this poll.My first attempt to gleam some statistics on how many subscribers the analytics-subscription services have was shot-down (quite appropriately) under privacy for the other subscribers.That is why I made this poll, so people could choose to volunteer that information, if they choose. (And I gather, because they would find the result interesting, or for their own benefit).Personally, I have been a long-term subscriber of both S3052s analysis, as well as Cypherdocs (relatively new, been around for just over a month), services.  The number of subscribers should have very little indication on whether the service is of high quality or not.S3052s service is great.  He (other than when the price went to 1.99) has kept a very level head, providing good analysis on the Bitcoin charts, and markets.  I really like the fact that when the Bitcoin market is boring he doesnt jump at shadows.If you ignore his short-term analysis (really how do you do short-term analysis in a market as unpredictable as bitcoin?), his analysis has been a great tool in getting a good picture of the (a) technical analysis prospective of Bitcoin.On the other hand I think that cypherdocs service is great also!  He focuses on more of the fundamental analysis of the real-world markets, not particularly so much on bitcoin.  His analysis has been spot-on and dead on time.  It is remarkable to listen to someone who has such a great feel for the wider markets.The other great thing about cypherdocs analysis is that he takes the time to explain how he got to such a position, logically portraying his thought processes, teaching the subscribers how to analyse and critically think about the markets as he.While S3052 and cypherdoc both seem to be perma-bulls, one can take that into account when reading their analysis.  As I often think It is just another prospective in to be taken account of, while I will still make my own trading decisions. +1Cyperdoc has a strong grasp of what is happening in the broader economy.   How much that directly affects the Bitcoin is what I question. (*well the independence of the Bitcoin to the rest of the worlds economy) Maybe... But it is interesting to have their opinion... Maybe just to see what way the lemmings are running... However I do mostly agree with cypherdoc's take on the US markets...Maybe not so-much with his take on Bitcoin. In other-words, take out medium-term shorts on everything, and hold lots of cash.  Or short-term US bonds.Remember the money bases M2, M3 are based upon 'leveraged assets.' If those assets dissolve, so does the overall monetary supply.
What Analytics-Subscription Service do you subscribe to?S3052: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1493.0Waveaddict: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=63880.0Cypherdoc: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=74587.0If there is a Analytics-Subscription service I'm missing, please post it below. No... I'm just a retard.... posted it to the wrong forum. Did my poll just get cleaned up??? I don't see how it was off-topic... adamstgBit normally your youtube links are great... this is just shit. The quality of the converted code apparently is very high with the IKVM project.  We could protentaly setup an automated conversion of BitcoinJ to C#.While helping impove the IKVM project.But I agree... C# is just so-much nicer to program than Java. Have you conceded using the Stratum protocol?http://stratum.bitcoin.cz/So instantly on first load Armoury, can be functional as a Bitcoin wallet...Then it could start loading the Bitcoin chain in the background, and eventually offering the hosing the stantum protocol to other Armoury (and electrum and any other thin client).It would be best if the Armoury could connect to 10 or 20 different other thin Stratum servers, so one bad server won't be able to scam. under the sea? We are going to Terra Rosa, a great place in the Melbourne CBD.  Since it is a restaurant, it will be fine for those who are under 18yo.http://www.terrarossarb.com.au/  cannot wait to see you guys at the meetup! I applaud this effort, so much so I am willing to make add a 10 BTC bounty for a Google Chrome 'app' in the same style as the Firefox one.Edit: To claim this bounty, the FF one must be first claimed to ThomasV's satisfaction.    ha ha... well at least it is a 'free' site...  I would have preferred if it was decypto tho: http://www.reddit.com/r/deCrypto/ (nsfw) Very funny! lawl. Yes... The Java Generic Settings only stores IF a password image has been set... not what image it is. Hey Mike, how is the progress to the next release going? Glbseica?   I need to spend more time on http://www.reddit.com/r/deCrypto (nsfw) yes you can display the seed.  so you could regenerate them on another system This thread is about the things that we can to strengthening the Bitcoin Community itself.I have been involved in many Community Projects in my life, both top-down controlled projects and decentralized communities like Bitcoin.  I would like to share some thoughts on how we can strengthen, build, and extend the Bitcoin CommunityI write this as there is lots of focus goes to the quantitate qualities of Bitcoin.  Such as its price, number of posts, hashing power, and the quality of the exchanges and the quality Bitcoin software itself.However there is the other element that we geeks often miss:  The Human Element. First, before I can suggest ways that we can maximise our human element I must define what constitutes a good community.A Good Community has the following features:1.       Every member is a member by consent.2.       Has respected leaders who lead by example, but dont control. 3.       Multifaceted and organic.4.       A place where one can find support, comfort, and belonging.5.       A structure that is built upon the sharing of ideas and teamwork.In essence, a good community is an organic structure where a member joins on their own accord and strategically commits their own resources to where they believe would have the most benefit for the parts of the community they care about (including themselves). Some suggestions for the Bitcoin Community:Be Friendly!  But not fools.The Bitcoin Community will be under constant siege from Scammers, Spammers, and Trolls.  When those who see an open, playful, and venerable new community it is like sweet pudding to the evil traits of the wider world.Welcome people in. Be honest about the risk of Scammers.  However dont be nasty.The most powerful weapon that this community has is execution.  Use it.  Trolls dont feed it them.When somebody is scammed, dont tease them.  Comfort and educate them so they may not lose all hope in Bitcoin itself.Support Charity; Bitcoin Charities.Jesus once said Why do you try and take the spec out of our friends eye, while you have a log in your ownAnd:  Let Dead will bury themselves(Wise words, either way, no matter you stance on religion or the history of it.). Yes.  Charity is extremely important.   However lets get this straight; we have enough work in our own back-yard, before helping the back-yard of other communities.  Lets focus on caring for those whom need help and are vulnerable of our OWN community.  Not focus on other communities who dont care about Bitcoin at-heart.So I ask?  Why isnt there a Bitcoin for Bitcoiners Charity!?See someone in the Community who you think needs help:  Go out of your way to help them! But be wise We dont want scammers getting our time, energy and Bitcoins! Make your own mind up! But dont be pig-headed.Do not ignore wisdom, in whatever form it comes in.If a so-called leader comes to the community and starts saying you must do xyz; ignore him/her.If a wise man/woman comes and suggests that you can, in self-inflection, change what you are doing to become more effective.  Do listen, think about it, and choose your action based upon what you think is right for yourself!Listen to people who have experience, for they have more-often-than-not been through it before.  Maybe you can learn from their mistakes?  Finally:  Be Creative!There are no bounds to the ingenuity of the human mind.   Use this! It is your greatest tool, pick something where you will be happy, and fell-like you are the most benefit for extending your goals.Find like-minded people from both within the Bitcoin community, and for others, who are outside and offer assistance, dont reject it. A hammer is a hammer; be it a friends, or your own.Please commit on your thoughts about this community.  Maybe suggesting some more practical ways this community can be strengthened.Note, my spelling, grammar, and English language skills in general are not particularly good.  Please pm me if you can find a better way to phase something. Genjix! Great Article!    Really enjoyed reading it!   Bitcoin Australia is running the First Ever! Melbourne Bitcoin Meetup.Wednesday, 23 May 2012 at 18:45 The Location is finalized yet.  However it will be somewhere in the Melbourne CBD.We are going to BassArt at E55 for the AfterParty!Please visit the main thread on Bitcointalk.org for more info:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=69060 Ok the laws to 'legal age' are a bit strange in Victoria for bars.   In general, if it is a bar you can enter, however they will ask ID when you buy a drink.Clubs on the other-hand require you to present your ID at the door.  Even those sometimes have that ability for a minor to enter; they will give you a writs-band so you cannot by alcoholic drinks.If we pick a venue that is like a 'bistro' then minors will have no issues.
So we of course are going to have the Melbourne Bitcoin Meet-Up Afterparty at BassArt!https://www.facebook.com/BassArte55Well It is going to be one hell of a night! Ha ha... Well I need to be able to make it with my very limited Photoshop skills.    I've nominally entered the time: 18:45 until 21:45The venue will most probably be somewhere in the city however it still needs to be confirmed/worked out. Event-planned:Melbourne MeetupWednesday, 23 May 2012!18:45 until 21:45Venue: TBA (Most Probably Somewhere in the CBD)https://www.facebook.com/events/345430765511234/ Make sure you use the Bitcoin-OTC... It is a Web of Trust for rating people after their transactions... Scammers very quickly get called out, and get negative ratings.Ive done many, many, trades, providing you do due-diligence in checking the trading history, before putting yourself at risk.If you receive bitcoins you are generally not at risk...If you are sending bitcoins you are at risk from scammers.If you keep a level head, check before putting yourself at risk use trusted 3rd parties as escrows, and overall dont do anything too stupid The life of a scammer will become quite unprofitable. Remember quantum computers have a exponential engineering difficulty increase for every added qbit.Building a quantum computer with 15 bit is (some factor above 1) harder than a 14bit one.the thing that we are still working out is: "what is this factor."     In the 'Java Paths' field you need to select where Java is going to look for the native libraries that contain all of the OT functions.On Windows 32bit you should select:  ./Win32/Release/On Windows 64bit you should select:  ./x64/Release/The 'Password Image File' is a .png or .jpg file that you want stored in your OT local storage for your password image.  A password image is a file that loads up, unique to you, so you don't supply a password to the wrong dialogue by mistake.Just select any Image file that you wish.You will also need to copy the '.ot' directory to:  ./AppData/Roaming/  in the root of your user directory... Normal: C:\Users\(username)\You will need to install the 32bit and 64bit version of java:http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jspAs well as the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Libaries:Win32: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8328x64: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13523 Have tried making a simple All-In-One package for those who want to just try-out moneychanger on windows:https://github.com/downloads/da2ce7/Moneychanger/Moneychanger-Win-24042012.7zPlease give me your comments! Updated the Moneychanger Build.I've decided to include both the Old and New packages in one archive this time. New OT Build for Windows.  Both Win32 and x64 this time!I have included the OpenSSL DLL's this time to make things a bit easier.Next build I'm going to be upgrading my OpenSSL packages to 1.0.1a New Moneychanger Builds incoming soon also! I Shrug. New Builds.  Ok... been testing my releases on other PC's been finding a few issues...1.  If you do not have Visual Studio 2010 SP1 with the Windows SDK 7.1 installed, you will not be able to run any of the 'Debug' builds.2.  For release builds you need to install:Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8328andMicrosoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64)http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13523(I have no idea why microsoft dosn't ship them with windows, but anyway...)3.  You needed to have OpenSSL installed... however, with my new builds I'll ship the OpenSSL DLL's with it. Ok... Updated the moneychanger builds again! Lets hope they have less issues this time!  well we already have my first fix... updated the moneychanger builds.Tomorow I'll put a list of the know issues on the OP. OUT OF DATE BUILDS - DO NOT USE!  -  Edit 30th October 2014Open Transactions (commonly abbreviated OT) is a collection of tools that helps people create financial transactions.Open Transactions is built around cryptographic messages.  Once can think it is as: gpg-email for money.While Bitcoin provides a great way to transfer value between on identity to another; it doesnt provide a good way to manage the ownership of real-things (such as hours worked, or the silver credits that your hold in your safe).Moneychanger is our demonstration test-wallet (and if it becomes stable one could use it as their main wallet) However for trivial amounts of value it should be ok.Source:If you are on a unix based system, the easiest way to get Open Transactions is to compile it yourself; please check-out our guides here:https://github.com/Open-Transactions/Open-Transactions/tree/master/docshttps://github.com/Open-Transactions/Moneychanger/tree/master/docOPEN TRANSACTIONS IS EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWAREDO NOT USE THESE BUILDS FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF VALUEFOR USE ONLY IN A DEDICATED TESTING ENVIRONMENTNO WARRANTY IS INCLUDED, OR IMPLIEDWindows:Code:SHA256(Open-Transactions-0.92.c-Win32-setup.exe)= 7b1c33c6427835f9b629902e06e057c8bb7638a2ba65346cc022a8786fcd8a00Bitcoin-OTC 'da2ce7': http://bitcoin-otc.com/viewratingdetail.php?nick=da2ce7Code:-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.22 (Darwin)Comment: GPGTools - https://gpgtools.orgowGbwMvMwCXIMl/GwHjr82uMpyuTGIJL+j4GezgamZpp+Bek5umGFCXmFScml2Tm5xXrGuhZGukl64Zn5hkb6RanlpQW6KVWpGraKpgnGSYbGyebmRiZWxibplkmmRlZWhoYpRqYpRqYmidbJCWZmxlbJBolJZqZGpuYJScbGBklWphbmKUlp1gkGhhwdcSxMAhyMbCxMoEcwMDFKQBzVbgKI8PR42dnul5azt2Qr85yL41PfrJBCj/TIXPT8GX/rA4derie4X/Z/PvCRxI9NKc/0t6z5ln2Haaal1kJrG88jaZtXdB+auYZAA===ehx0-----END PGP MESSAGE-----Download:https://www.dropbox.com/s/htrobk8ifanaihz/Open-Transactions-0.92.c-Win32-setup.exeOpen Transaction isn't much use without digital assets:Digital Assets:Make sure your check out markm's thread for actual uses of OT:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=53329Hope everyone likes it!  Please report bugs.   thanks   so far sent coins to 5 ppl.  https://www.facebook.com/bitcoinausIm running a promotion to get the Aussie Bitcoin Facebook Page more popular!Im giving away 0.01 BTC to anyone who likes our page!

Hmm... I don't know... I sugest you get out of the newbie jail and post in the mining forum  Just wondering.... How many subscribers do you have?
I like the article, however your blogs css needs a bit of workThe most important thing to do is include a small padding either side of the article, so that the text doesnt end at the same point as the boarder.Secondly, place a black boarder around the images. (The same 1px black border that is around the two columns).  Also place a 3 to 4 px margin around the pictures.These simple changes will greatly improve the look of your blog. Great Site!     Good to see that the Lad's are getting involved as well..   Chuck Norris has 42 million Bitcoins, and even he cannot spend them. Of Course you are going to be implementing the Sipa HD Wallet's.For Random Private Key Generation... It may be beneficial in using the https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mini_private_key_formatThis would make the keys smaller for easy transfer on paper.  This may come in handy when you implement a 'print paper backup' feature. This one is great!  It is one of the best explanations of bitcoin I've seen! The Fisrt Block: http://blockexplorer.com/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26fWas Made at: Saturday, 3 January 2009 at 18:15:05 (UTC)In Tokyo (Japan): Sunday, 4 January 2009 at 3:15:05 AM  (JST)  Hope that Clears It Up!!  We all know there is going to be a big rally.Why.  Because we ALL are the early adopters.  We are the people that many will complain:  It isnt fair, that they got to buy all these cheap bitcoinsThe thing is that there really arent bulls, or bears As everyone trading bitcoin now is in early.I dont think that the really will kick-off hard just yet.  The fundamental Bitcoin infrastructure is just not ready yet.There isnt anything much more wise that the free-market.  The free market doesnt make the same sort of mistake twice. (Well at least the same pools of investors dont make the same mistake twice).We will be making money shorting all the little bubbles on the way up.  (While we hold large amounts of bitcoin for long-term investments).However the new people who didnt invest in the last round will bring bitcoin up, into another. Much. Much Much larger Bubble. So accumulate bitcoin at the lowest price you can After all the market we have now is the early invertors trying to get the largest slice of the pie. Before it grows.So. When the bitcoin price goes up to $20 that is from the early investors fighting over the pie.That is nothing.Then it may stagnate...Then. Bitcoin will become much more mainstream popular.  Bring a hoard of new people, companies, and interest.  This will be when bitcoin will grow maybe to $1000/$2000 per bitcoin.Edit: Title Corrected... Gamma, Grammar. OMG... I just worked it out!  The bitcoin price shows the bitcoin price!!!  What have I been doing all these years?? Satoshi has stated he was 'ok' after the Japan Earthquakes, he suggested he is in TokyoSo maybe placing the birth place for the first block in,  Tokyo, Japan would be most-correct. If you solo mine, you will get less bitcoins than what you would theoretically get via mining in a pool, because the block variance for a small hash-rate is larger than the amount of time for the difficulty to increase. Well this is the speculation forum... It would be appropriate to use Horoscopes. The speculation Sub-Forum is still my favourite... https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0However this one has been dramatically improving    Go Bitcoin! Been wondering about having a Bitcoin Meetup in Melbourne?  Any Interest? @S3052,Have you considered branching out your market analysis into other markets, (other than just Bitcoin and Silver).I would expect there would be a demand for other subscriptions, other than for bitcoin technical analysis. People whom are using windows for Finance, should be using Windows 7.  If you are using windows 7, there is no reason why you wouldn't be using the 64bit version.Windows XP is hard to keep secure, and is about to run-out on its security updates.My conclusion is:  Windows XP is old, and soon to be insecure. Don't worry about not being able to support it. He. He... you will never be the same again...No OT doesnt have any built-in WOT system... however there is another active project for that:http://privwiki.dreamhosters.com/wiki/Distributed_Web_of_Trust_Proposal_2Ok... For you windows developers out there...  I've compiled the latest OT to Windows 32 bit, with full debugging symbols:  Here is the link to the binary:https://github.com/downloads/da2ce7/Open-Transactions/OTBuild_Win32_Debug_03042012.7zWarning... Still very-much pre-alpha for windows... your mileage may vary. Bug in Multibit:When Sending bitcoins, my ballance is going UP!  This shoudn't be happening...Multibit is not getting rid of the old bitcoins, and is just adding the cange to my ballance:How can I help debug this problem? I'm running multibit 0.3.1 Bitcoin + Open Transactions + Web Of Trust are the building blocks for a complete replacement of the traditional finance industry.  They each solve a different problem.Bitcoin:Provides:  Low-Trust transfer of Value between two parties.Needs: Way to transfer ownership of real-life goods and service contracts. (Open Transactions)Needs: Trust network so people can have more confidence that they are dealing with somebody whom is trusted and respected. (Web-Of-Trust)Open Transactions:Provides: Tools to transfer the ownership of anything that can be described in a contract.Needs: Low-Trust transfer of value, without the risk of counter-party. (Bitcoin)Needs: Trust Network, so the contracts can have some reputation backing them. Web-Of-TrustWeb-Of-Trust:Provides: Reputation system so there is consequences if somebody scams (nobody will trade with them), and good reputations have value.Needs: Low-Trust transfer of value, so parties with no reputation can build a good reputation: (Bitcoin)Needs: Formal way to describe contracts, that can describe the transfer of ownership in a un-deniable way:  (Open Transactions)Each technology provides a solution to a different problem When working together, they provide the basis for a very secure, strong, and comprehensive financial system. We are just seeing free-market optimization at work again... Pushing out the miners whom are not efficient.It also means for every small increase in the bitcoin price, we will be seeing a larger increase in the hashing rate.I would suggest that also... we are only seeing bitcoins being sold at the rate they are being produced... not a greater rate. (don't sell you bitcoins, just sell your miners instead).
What about this one:Ha, Ha. I'm really not very good at this visual design thing.Background image by Hai Linh Truong: http://www.flickr.com/photos/linh_rom/2270171257/ Hmm... Yes a Coat of Arms represents a history of violence. Not, Good...I guess I can make a new one... Any Idea's? Updated the Banner!  What do people think?  (See OP) the small wall, just moved up!   KVIrc is great!  It has good support for both Windows and Linux, support SASL natively (important for Freenode) and has great theme support.http://www.kvirc.net/ We are re-vamping our Facebook Page as-well!  Please have some fun and join our page!  http://fb.me/bitcoinaus We really should provide a video upload service, where they can upload their videos, and collect bitcoin donations! We should tell the Girls about http://coinabul.com/ where they can trade their bitcoin into sexy, sexy, Gold and Silver coins.  Remember the videos of cafe's getting their website removed from their windows after the 2000 dot.com bust?But notice how the internet has become a key part of life? Well the arguement could be made that non-tech-savvy users shouldn't in-the-long-run be running full nodes. They rarther should be running nodes like bitcoinj.   If the bitcoin block chain keeps on getting larger at this rate, it will be not that long untill your really need higher-end hardware to run a full node. mmap is the right solution to the problem that you have... it just is botched up on 32bit oses.  I would consider asking "do we really need to support 32bit operating systems for a full bitcoin client?"  I would suggest that running in non-full-node mode for a 32bit os makes sense and is a reasonable trade-off. Since First-bit addresses are derterministic, I think that they should be fully supported in the Satoshi Bitcoin client.Unfortunalty, I'm not a c++ coder, I so I cannot develop it myself.I think this will be a very good system to include in the offical bitcoin client, making life easier for anyone who shares a bitcoin address.Edit: On talking to some people in #bitcoin-dev, it seems like firstbits, while useful for minimally referencing a bitcoin address, should not be encouraged, as it makes it much easier to scam. I think that it is important that the users start to move to firstbits.Otherwise there is just too-much counter-party risk. Inputs are not included in the transaction base; so once the transaction base is made; it is possible for 3rd parties to add fees. (However they cannot collect any change)It is possible to make a transaction with any outputs, then pass it around your friends, than they each add an input.Satoshi himself outlined one way for how you could do this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2181.msg28729#msg28729 Well I love that stuff also.  It is what makes the Speculation forum great!I loved all those 'buy now!!!!' threads... then the price goes down.  It teaches people to think for themselves. Completely Disagree.  This is the POINT of the speculation forum!Completely Agree.  They serve no purpose in this form! Sounds like a good way to clean up the other forums from Atlas-spam at-least... There are only so-many times that "The Hammer" can get used... before people stop looking at the depth (other than for calculating slippage of-course). Two Feature Requests.Secure "New Version of Multibit Available" announcements built into the main screen.Secure "Securty Update for Multibit" that shows instead multibit, (however multibit can be still run with an override).Secure "New Version of Java Available" announcements.  (check the version of Java running)Secure "Security Update to Java - Must Upgrade"  that shows instead multibit, (however multibit can be still run with an override).I dont know how feasible such announcements would be.  However it would make me much more combatable recommending multibit to non-tech people. beter to post on the old thread than make a new one...    I don't know why this forum has that silly warning.
While it is great that Luke has put the time into preparing these next-test builds . I just wanted to explain why the maroon pull patches are contested.The problem is that this may (quite unlikely) correct to an unspendable address. Support URI with Satoshi or Hex or (Tonal, that is just hex with funny characters).  Problem.  People want URI's to be easily human readable.Danger of buffer overflow, (if there is a bug in the to hex code).  Virtually no real-life performance gain.Tonal support, tonal is base 16 numbers with strange characters for the numbers higher than 9.Problem: nobody cares about tonal other than Luke. Um... Money is just a unit of accounting for transferring value between people and corporations.The question is what sort of money you are using To be honest.... that city looks boring.I love the minecraft cities that are more 'organic' By default if you can steal the log of someone, you then can steal there wallet.dat.

You are complexly mixing up the different concepts of 'quantity of security' and 'quality of security'If is like having a huge poorly trained army (that may be able to defend a country from external war)...However you need special elite forces to defend against internal and sensitive disputes (such as dealing with spy's).By your logic, because the special forces cannot defend an entire country against an invasion, they are:Im arguing that more than one type of security is required. and for defending against internal attacks, the extremely high quality of the security that we have is a good thing.The problem the proof-of-stake is that it requires TRUST.  You must trust the people who have large numbers of bitcoin, to be both active, and not malicious with their investment.  With the current proof-of-work being stakeholder counts for nill as you dont need defence, if you are not transacting your bitcoins.A web-of-trust, (or even a proof-of-stake, a type of web-of-trust), that provides a lower grade of security, but at a much lower cost (so we can afford a very large quantity), is good for the 2nd line of defence, that we use against 51% attacksHowever I do not agree that the proof-of-work is made irrelevant by the proof-of-stake idea.  Rather I think that they provide solutions to different problems. The proof-of-work is very good for stopping internal attacks... It however provides no natural defence against attacks that are externally financially motivated.It is completely reasonable that the internal bitcoin community can decided what miners they trust, and weigh their blocks more than of blocks from unknown miners.   Such a defence is called a web-of-trust, and it provides a different quality of security to a proof-of-work.Since the proof of work is to defend against internal attackers anyway there is no problem in using a different type of defence to defend against externally motivated attackers. So a proof-of-work is already secure enough to secure against internaly motivated double spends, why would an external 51% attack completely dis-credit it?That is akin to saying Something getting defeated by an attack that it wasnt designed to defend against, means that the original design was faulty?  - No it just means that the attack was out of specification. The problem with proof-of-stake is:1.   As proposed require a fundamental change in how bitcoin operates. 2.   The security of Bitcoin should be up to those who 'trade' bitcoin, not those who own lots of it... Holding bitcoin is always going to be safe, even under a 51% attack.  The problem lies with trading it.3.   Why not publicly signing something saying that you own a particular bitcoin address that holds many bitcoins is not enough of evidence that you own bitcoin?The key point should be that we build the infrastructure that doesnt change how bitcoin works, that allows us to respond much more effectively to a 51% attack.The two key things to do are:1.   A standard way to produce cryptographic signatures showing who made the block.This will allow website such as blockchain.info to check tell whom is the owner of the block in a much more secure way than just looking at the coin-bases and the IP address that the block was announced from.2.   The hooks for user-defined checkpoint, so this later on can be used by the user to choose a chain based on any criteria they wish.Both of these things do-not change how bitcoin operates at all (possibly the mining signature within the block will need some modification to the block format however Im not an expert in _how_ one would make cryptographically secure block-signatures, however, I do believe that it is useful and doesnt change the fundamentals of bitcoin). I think you have a large misunderstanding on how bitcoin operates.  How would you enforce this, when you want the network to remain opon for new miners?2nd IP addresses are very very poor at identifying a node. IP black lists will never work. Nothing... the attacker will just use bounces, many IP addresses, connect to different nodes block, or mines over TOR.  The latency for release of the attacking chain that has been mined with 51% hashing power isn't important in the long run. A web-of-trust based system will never work without two main features:1.   Active Human Thinking Trusted Parties.2.   Cryptographically Secure Announcement of Trust RelationshipsYou cannot have a secure web-of-trust without active human maintenance figuratively you are trading computational security through the proof-of-work.  With trust gained by human interactions.AKA... You cannot have your cake and eat it.Edit: I suggest that using Unique IP address would be a poor security model against a motivated 51% attack.  As it would tend to lead to many different solutions, as the attacker would also flood the network with malicious nodes.  (Remember that a 51% attacker must be externally motivated to the bitcoin network) Therefor it is likely that the attacker would have many times the financial resources disposable than the entire bitcoin network can use to defend against it. My proposal:1.   Miners release signatures of their blocks by-default.  If they want to remain anon, either dont release one or use a new identity for every block.2.   Bitcoin will display a warning if the current chain contains a very unexpectedly long time without any blocks from its favourite miners.3.   Bitcoin also displays warning when favourite miner blocks consistently get orphaned.4.   Upon detecting an active alternative fork, that contains many blocks made by the nodes favourite miners, an option will be given to the user to move to the forked chain.Edit:  By Favourite I mean, whoever the developer of the particular client decides are trusted.The user should be provided with a clear and simple way to change the default favourite miners. This has been a problem that has been on the back of my mind for a very long time also.The core component is that this will provide a 2nd line of security against attacks based upon a web-of-trust style of security model, rather than the absolute who hashes the most security model.From the start-out the web-of-trust and computational problem security models have different qualities of truth statements.The quality of the security that a cryptographic problem provides is a provable solution, which is non-relative.  All parties in the system will come to the same exact solution.  It can be summarised as the quality statement:  This is absolutely true for everyoneIn legal terms it may be said as:  This is true without any doubtThis can be dramatically contrasted with the quality of the security that a web-of-trust provides.  A web-of-trust gives a relative prospective for the solution.   Each party may or may not come to the exact same conclusion, based upon whom they trust.  It can be summarised as: This is good enough for meIn legal terms it may be said as:  This is true enough for my purposesNow  Having such a strong truth statement comes at a much higher cost that a less rigorous truth statement.   The cost in the case for bitcoin is that there is no human element in deciding what chain is valid or not. Instead it is entirely left up to whoever can gather the most hashing power.Economically, such a high level of truth statement is affordable to protect bitcoin against internal attacks, (people within the bitcoin community).  Namely those whom want to seal through double spending bitcoins.However, the economics doesnt provide any natural protection against an externally motivated attacker.  The attacker whom gains the finance through taxation, or the protection of established systems that bitcoin competes with.Much higher levels of security can be gained far more cheaply by lowering the required truth statement.Think?  Is the precise order of the transactions important; if the network is being attacked by an attacker who stops all the transactions?This is where casascius gets his idea of a trust based system to protect against the 51% attack  It is more important that we gain an Extremely High level of security against a motivated 51% attack, than maintain our Extremely Strong level of truth statement.PS.  For a long time, I have been conceptually designing a web-of-trust coin However Ive never came up with a good way to issue the new coins However It could work as a low-cost security backend for a pre-allocated *coin. Having the pools include a signture within the blocks they produce is a very good starting point.It dosn't harm the network in any-way... However makes the post 51% attack 'cleanup' much easier. Cool look jim!Though I do think that the wallet list is a bit busy... maybe put some stronger horizontal emphases between the elements? Well the UK thing to do (that I have done) is to gett smashing drunk at your local with some bitcoin friends you've met on IRC.  Then spending the next day wishing you had never met them. In Australia I guess you could have a Bitcoin BBQ, or smoke some weed and talk about how 'dope' bitcoi is (or both).  However I think the most Aussie thing to do is to buld a trading system that makes bitcoins, cheap (aka. Close to the market rate), and easy for the normal bloak to get his hand on some.Just a group of people where we can bounce off eachother is a good start. Hmm... Well IRC is good fun... it is good for planning and working together as a team...  We should consider getting a website for guides, and other more static documentation. I don't, or wouldn't... My Leverage is always manageable.  The post was sarcastic.

Some Basic IRC notes:1. Use a secure connection...Connect to: https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bitcoin-aus&uio=d4   <-  see the https  2. Use a good IRC client....Maybe KVIR.   or irssi (if you are textschool)2b.  Connect to a good server... such as chat.au.freenode.org and connect on port 7000 so you force yourself to use SSL!!3.  Register a IRC nickname...easy as: /ns register (password) (email)3b.  Don't use the same password as your email!! or Bitcointalk!!!4. Make sure you have enforce on:easy as /ns set enforce on5. Connect via SASL!well for KVIRC it is easy... for others it may be a bit more hard.6. Get a Cloak...politely ask for one in #freenode Ha ha... Well that is most of the basic done! If you get to this stage... well you won't be counted as a IRC noob anymore! FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111111111 The great thing about us Australians is that we are real go-getters at heart!  We will go and innovate, and lead the world when we get a chance to.Having a strong community will allow us to build upon each others skills and abilities, and duplicate the minimum amount of work.  Making us much stronger and effective, and giving us the real-possibility to lead the world.The reason Ive decided to spear-head re-building the Australian Bitcoin Community is that I feel that it is very important that we get the ball rolling now, before the massive influx of new people comes from the next big bitcoin rally.By the way, I am chiefly involved in the Open Transactions project; this project allows people to trade the ownership of real-life assets online, in a cryptographically secure and reliable way.  This project is complexly different to bitcoin.  Open Transactions solves a different problem to bitcoin, making them particularly powerful if used together.

I'm really digging this video:http://youtu.be/kdvTkddp1F0Edit:  BTW, not my vid... but cheers to whomever made it! Certanly a good batch. Luke, I like your proposal, upon first read. It looks like an elegant and effective solution to the BIP16/17 drama we previously had. Gold going down, mean that the economy 'feels' more safe (it isn't we are still perched on the edge of a cliff).Therefore, value will move from Gold into more risky investment, such as Oil, and Bitcoin.  (and the stock market, but I would be staying away from that If I was you).In another round and if as Bitcoin becomes more respected and safe,  pressure from the continually devaluating dollar, will push value back into Bitcoin, and Gold.Bitcoin is uniquely positioned to benefit from both saturations. well they uses such lines continuously telling how good and important the dollar is, and how everything they you depend on requires you to like the dollar.I can assure everyone that you wont get mass adoption of bitcoin through logic and well-thought-out reason, alone. So far this has been the only prediction/observation in quite a while that has proven to be correct for more than 1 day. I want some... Can you please keep a header section of your OP updated with availability? Popcorn! Popcorn!Anyone Want Popcorn???Selling for $1K each standard 100g serving size, ask for full terms and conditions! Well you need to stick with the exchanges that at least have _some_ volume...Also once you start buying 100K coins... that would create enough volume to make arbitrage worth doing. I would not affect MTGox if you kept the volume low... Other than tightening the overall supply of bitcoin.The bitcoin market is very good at arbitrage.

Yep nice catch.... LOL, never been so good at spelling. Ive just noticed that the BitcoinTalk has dragged itself out of the sewer, out of the gutter, and is starting to crawl like a vomiting drunk man again!Welcome back!IRC has also improved lots of with good conversations, and insightful comments!Overall I think that the bitcoin community has started to re-build and become a friendly place again! Edit: Spelling. On the cost of having massive offline hashing capabilities:We are already seeing the significant cost to mining as being the electricity usage.  Even with the massive change per year in hashing efficiency gained by new technologies.Over time it is likely that the cost to mining will become much more dependent on the cost of electricity than it is now.  The main reason is that the technology isnt going to progress at the same rate as it is progressing now.We have seen the 500x improvement from going from CPU mining to GPU mining, 2years ago.We are now seeing the 10x improvement from going from GPU to FPGA.And we are just now beginning the 5x improvement from going from FPGA to ASIC.The trend is clear.  Do you think that the generation 4 ASIC miner is going much, faster than the generation 3?  Then what about the generation 6 or 7 or 10 miners??  The improvement as the technology for hashing for bitcoin matures, always decreases.This means that while it is better to buy the newest generation miners.  The old miners are not completely made oblique.   CPUs are never going to be useful in hashing for bitcoin again However FPGAs may have quite a long life-time.When it is no-longer profitable to run your FPGA all the time What happens when a group of insurance companies offer you a quite profitable rate for on-demand hashing?  Do you just say no or do you take up the offer for additional income.The hashing needs of the network are going to become more and more dynamic, depending on the price.  If an attack is happening against the network, there will be many players who will be happy to pay, temporally, a higher price, for more hashing power.  Meaning that the old miners will be dusted off, and switched on probably automatically via auctions for hashing power. There still seems to be quite some confusion about some of the potential attacks to a bitcoin network where the vast majority of the hashing power is only used when an attack is detected.To add some clarity, Ill go through each attack independently.Double Spending AttackThe ideal double spending attack involves:1.   Making a transaction for another hard asset; such as physical face-to-face transfer of cash.2.   As soon as this transaction is complete, secretly mine a chain that spends the above coins to a different address.3.   Once well-ahead of the publicly known chain, attack release the hidden chain and the network reorganises onto the more-ahead chain.Now this attack seems pretty fool-proof, until you do the numbers.  If (for whatever reason, Ill come to that later), the bitcoin network wants to quickly orphan the offending chain, it will do so.Say that the attacker has 2x the base-load of the network, and waits for 6 blocks of the public chain before releasing.  This means that the attacker (on average) will have a 6-block lead against the rest of the network.When this attacking chain is released, lets say 100x the base load hashing power is used to orphan the chain.   When the attacker has completed block number 13, the other chain has just completed 50 blocks, and now has a 43 block lead.  This completely orphans the attackers chain.Effects:When quite a few attackers have attempted to double spend, then quickly get squashed in the 1st or 2nd block after they release their chain, this will naturally raze the barrier  to attack while no significant continuous  hashing resources are being spent.  Attackers dont attack just for fun, but they attack to win.   If the attacker wants to double spend, and win; they and the network holds 100x hashing resources to defend an attack.  Any-individual attacker must also have 100x the hashing power to win.  (Of course they get a very trivial head-start, by starting the attack in private).This will make attacks on the network rare.Supply Blocking attack(Please note, that this attack must be externally funded to the bitcoin economy, as an internal malicious attacker would never be able to recoup the resources used to conduct this attack from the bitcoin economy itself).This attack involves having more than 51% of the hashing power of the network, and orphaning any block that doesnt agree with the attackers goals.  (Be it to kill bitcoin, or force high transaction fees, or regulate bitcoin in some way).One would do this now by:1.   Judge how much hashing power there is on the network2.   Halve that number, and put a bit more on for margin of error3.   Turn on this hashing power, and orphan any block that doesnt agree with your rules.This attack is quite simple to do with the current network.  Also you can be virtually confident that your attack will success if the attacker gathers more than 75% of the current hashing power.With dynamic hashing power, the base-load hashing power becomes irrelevant; the maximum, sustainable hashing power becomes the important metric.The attacker must guess what amount of the dynamic hashing load is sustainable, by the network, gaining much more hashing power than this for a safety margin.  This brings both up the uncertainly of the attack, and the cost.However, the network will not just say, Im getting tired now. It will become a big game of bluff.  If the attackers chain is orphaned by the network by a significant margin (say more than 2000 blocks), then the network may automatically cement into the new chain.Overall The same security issues with this externally funded attack remain for either a static hashing load or a dynamic hashing load.  However the dynamic hashing load makes the uncertainties in attacking the network much higher as well as not wasting as much electricity when there is no attack happening. If only one insurance companies transactions get reversed... Then id expect only that company to pay for orphaning the attacking chain.If more than one companies transactions are getting reversed, then they all have a vested intrest to work together in orphaning the offending chain.  If one company didn't join in to help; that company would in the future receive less corporation. As well as loosing public reputation. Electricity is the major cost of a long-term mining operation.Yes, the hardware is changing rapidly now... However bitcoin is new.  Doing many many Sha256 sums isn't a problem that has been important to do, like it is now.In 20 or 40 years when the block reward is much much lower... I would expect there would be a huge number of miners who would have already paid off there equipment, but don't mine, as it isn't profitable.An insurance company could make an application that automaticaly buys hashing power at the cheapest market rate, when it needs it.  When there is an attack,the insurance company could be willing to buy much more hashing than when there is no attack. Yes.  Cementing has a risk.However the risk is inversely proportional to the number of blocks you go back.There are two 'in particular' attacks here.1. Segmenting a particular client from the rest of the bitcoin network.2. Trusting 'someone' to declare blocks 'evil'.The first attack is mitigated by having a basic connection web-of-trust.  Where a client displays a warning when it hasn't got any messages from known good nodes.  This only defends against only being connected to an attacker.  It didn't centralize the core part of bitcoin.  It just makes a network re-org much harder to make without being completely seceret.You don't need to have an "evil bit".  You can detect a reorganization chain as being malicious uner the following conditions:Is more than 100 blocks long.Contains double spending transactions, when compared with the previously accepted chain.Unspends transactions that were in the previous chain for more than 6 blocks. While not directly related to how high or low (I think the difficulty will be low).I have posted a separate thread on why having a low "base load" hashing power isn't a bad thing... Rarther a good thing:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=68218.0Hope my above thread shows why "difficulty" isn't the be-end-all on bitcoin security. Block rewards are going to be very low, so are transaction fees.  The the only reason to turn your miner on is to defend against an attack.Insurance companies have a vested interest in making attacks against their customers unprofitable.  (by orphaning a double spending chain that hurts their customers).  So any attack is likely to be killed by the free market. I'm sorry.  Where is the economic incentive to cheat?If an insurance company is protecting your transaction, they may choose to let the reorganization happen (cheaper just to pay the lost transactions they cover).  However if it is cheaper to orphan the hidden chain.  Then that choice will be taken.)However if a few different insurance companies are going to loose money on the reorganization, then they will decide as a team to orphan the offending chain.  This has a feedback where if one of the companies didn't play fair, they will loose reputation. Also, the more long the hidden chain has been kept, the more obvious it is when it is released.A WOT based chain locking after 1000 blocks would stop the most long-term attacks.However it is easy to display a warning when there is a large reorganization... And even if there is a large lead... With much more hashing power 'in waiting' any reorganization is likely to be very short lived; and never successful. (in the long run). When an attacker publishes a 'seceret' chain that reverses some transactions, the network will detect this and quickly mine enough blocks to orphan that seceret chain.The network must maintain enough "base load" to make such hidden attacks unprofitable in the general case.Say the network has 100x dynamic hashing power to use against such double spending attacks.  A 100 block hidden fork will take only 1 block (of time) to reset back to the non attacker chain.Also clients can be desigened to detect such a reorganizatio, and wait a fewmore bocks for confidence.   Yes it dose.1.  The attacker knows how much hashing power is needed to attack the network now.  With dynamic hashing the ammount of power needed is unknown untill untill that attack is atempted.2.  The network is expending unnecessary resources maintaining a high hashrate when there is no attack.  It is much more efficient to save the resources now, in preperation for an attack.3.  The network may be able to defend at a much higher hashrate for a short amount of time.  While the attacker dose not know how long or what % of the total defencive power is used.Edit: Grammar. So why is this post important?...Lots of people have been scared of the natural low difficulty bitcoin will have once the reward per block is lowered dramatically, and the block size is increased.What the above post sugests is th having a constant high difficulty will in the long run be less secure.Instead it will be much more secure for the network to have lots of hashing power "in the wings" waiting to defend against an attack.Then I proposes a "bitcoin transaction insurance company" so that the defensive hashing power will not be subject to the "tragedy of the commons" problems that plauge other defensive solutions. Hello.  I just want to clear up some half-truths about this topic.First:  Difficulty != Security. -  However generally there lots of correlation between the two.Security is defined by: Cost of carrying out a successful attack against the bitcoin network v.s. direct gain to the attacker.Bitcoin has never provided security against attacks that have 3rd party financial gain.Even with the block reward at 50, bitcoin is not secure against a large attacker whom take their gain from maintain the status co.  For example: a Bank, or a Government.  (This is why it is important that the community designs non-proof-of-work based crypto-currencies as alternatives)So point 1:  Bitcoin isnt secure from a power determined attracter, even with the ideal settings that it has now.Continually-high difficulty will tend to be less secure than very high only when needed difficulty.If the entire network is expending large amounts of resources on maintaining a constant very high difficulty; this will lower the total resources available to the bitcoin economy to defend against a (relatively) short-term attack.For example, maintaining a difficulty of 1M necessitates that the entire bitcoin community spend the resources to maintain that value.  However an attacker only needs to spend the resources to gain a hashing value of 2M equiv. for two weeks, to do significant disruption to the entire bitcoin economy.There is a constant loss of 1M equiv. on the bitcoin economy.  However the attacker only needs to budget for a loss of 2M equiv. for a much shorter time This gives the potential attacker a large financial advantage over the long term.Point 2:  Continuous high difficulty make the bitcoin economy less well positioned to defend against a real attack.Attacks against the bitcoin network are statistically easily detectable and can be quickly defended against.There are two main types of attacks that an opponent with a majority hashing power would carry out; the they are both very obvious.1.   Double Spending, this attack re-writes the order of the transactions, making retrospectively (to the POV of the receiver of the coins), removing the previously agreed to transaction.2.   Supply blocking.  This attack either the attacker requires a registration of every transaction before accepting them into the block chain or will just reject every transaction.  This is likely to me a much more damaging attack to the long-term future of the bitcoin economy.When either of these attacks happen, the bitcoin economy is going to be very away of them happening.  There will be time to mount a significant defence before serious damage has been done to the economy.Point 3:  Attacks are easily detected, and there is enough time to mount a defence against them.Vested interest in the Bitcoin economys healthEveryone who owns bitcoins, or indirectly is dependent on the bitcoin economy, has a financial (or philosophical) interest to defend the bitcoin network from attack.This means that there is a very large potential amount of value that can be put behind the bitcoin network in the case that the bitcoin network is indeed actively being attacked.  (50% value is better than 0% value on investment).This value is NOT dependant on the rewards that the bitcoin network provides to the continuous active miners.  This value is dependent on the bitcoin economy size at-large.Point 4:  The value behind protecting the bitcoin network is much larger than the value provided by the block rearwards or transaction fees.With these points in mind, I would like to make this suggestion for the most secure way that the bitcoin network may wish to work:1.    The block rewards (eg, new bitcoins, + transaction fees), only need to cover trivial internal annoyances that happen when the continuous hash rate is too-low.  I suggest that 0.1% of the bitcoin market cap per year will be about what is required to stop these trivial attacks.2.   The bitcoin network may have a continuous hashing value as low as 100K or less.  Yet remain generally secure.ConclusionsBitcoin Transaction Insurance companies will hold much of the 1st line dynamic hashing power.  The will be companies that sell a service to businesses that will cover any losses due to reversed transaction double spending.When an double spending attempt is (automatically) detected, against one of the insurances companies clients, they will dynamically decide if it is cheaper to fire up their miners and orphan the offending block, or pay-out the value of the transaction.For the functional security of their customers they dont require a very high constant hashing rate.  Rather a known potential very high hash rate.  (Something that it isnt profitable to attack against).The free market will bring down the price of the insurance to the minimum cost that it requires to defend against the attackers.The 2nd line of dynamic hashing power will be bitcoin banks and other bitcoin trading businesses.These companies will keep very large hashing power offline, unless there a systematic attack against the network is detected.  In that case, they will turn on their miners and out-power the attacker for as long as the attacker has resources for.  Once the attack has been given up the miners turn off, and are ready to turn on again at the drop of a hat.The 3rd line of dynamic hashing power will be individuals whom have a large stake in the success of bitcoin.  They will work much the same as the 2nd line, however will only turn their miners on when everything else looks about to fail.TL;DR:Once the network changes from a static hashing defence, to a dynamic hashing defence; and potential attacker must not only overcome continuous hashing rate, (that may be quite low).  But also overcome a massive hashing power that is only activated in the case of an attack.The bitcoin economy only needs to expend additional resources _when_ an attack is occurring. (and expending resources in maintaining the offline miners, and purchasing them in the first case; but this is generally a one-off investment, not a continuous cost).While the attacker must provide a continuously high hash rate, above all the defensive dynamic hash rate available.Edit: Formating/Spelling Well for this to happen we need:1.   Stable OT Market Server2.   Issuers that issue to the market server3.   Good library in for easily attaching an OT client to pre-developed trading packages.4.   Scripts that can automate the certificate generation and basic testing.OT still needs lots of work, but it is starting to stabilize.Work in splitting the OT-Client wrapper from the Moneychanger project has only just started, there is still much more work to be done for that. (I was starting that project)Issuing certificates is all done by hand atm.  We really should have a little python app or something that can automate much of that.OT has a huge amount of potential, however it just needs lots and lots of work to take it from the proof-of-concept stage it is at now, to a more useable solid solution for finance. Bitcoin:  "I'm hard and my market cap is getting larger" Well said... Well said. Yes, dont threat.  GPU's are at most 10x faster than cpu's for litecoin mining.  For Bitcoin it is at least 100x faster on a GPU.This means that Litecoin is at least 10x more efficient on a CPU than Bitcoin.Over time, this gap will narrow; as the in-built GPU's in inside every computer get better. Yep... That is why we cross-sign pgp keys once we have verifed the owner of them.  
You could have code on the TPM that checks that the said bitcoin block is next in the chain, form the last block hash that it keeps in secure memory.Since blocks have a timestamp, this could be used as an 'ever increasing' date system.  Giving a general guarantee of the date.A more advanced chip could make sure that the transactions it signs are from blocks that it has seen.I think that in the future the block chain can be used as a secure time source. Um... yes. The bitcoin block-chain. Good reporting of US economy inflation has been updated for 2012... This is a free report.http://www.shadowstats.com/article/no-414-hyperinflation-special-report-2012Reading it now... Will post some comments once read. Insider Trading is great!!It means that the more accurate price is reflected sooner... meaning that investors are not miss-lead longer.  (Meaning fewer bad investments are made).    I will love to come!   ha ha... yep!  Used not to matter when bitcoins were worth like 10c each...Don't worry; the new website will have a much lower and nicer fee schedule... Bitcoin Service is a site that allows you to sell your digital goods for bitcoins.We were the first site that offered downloads for bitcoin.This site is still functional and working.  (with some downtime)We have been busy working on the next generation version of bitcoinservice.co.uk.    The next generation website will soon be announced for testing.All existing members of bitcoinservice.co.uk will be transferred to the new website, and your bitcoins are safe.  However because of our new security model the existing files cannot be directly moved to the new website.We will keep all the files available for 3-months after the successful launch of the new website.Have Fun.Cam. @ zhoutongWhat is the tx id of the lost coins? The problem is that it is two many bits... we are dealing with exponential functions here, boys.  wow.... this looks really cool.  No? LAWL... Scraping the bottom of the barrel are we? RaggedMonk you seem insane and should shut up now.  Otherwise I suggest you will lose the remaining threads of respect that you may still command in this community. ps. updated my post, so state that whoever was the last administrator of Witcoin should be responsible for the fact that the coins are not available to the registered users. This is how I see it;1.  Whoever is the administrator of Witcoin must also provide a reliable way for any user that is registered to withdraw their witcoin's as bitcoin. (no matter what state the website is in).2.  CryptoCoinMedia (the owner of the domain, and original payee of the hosting), is doing the community service of making sure that the bitcoins are indeed still under the control of Bitcoincconsultancy (or who ever was the last administrator), (shown by a pre-stated transfer to an address that has a public signature attracted to it).CryptoCoinMedia isn't requesting that he gains control of the bitcoins; rather Bitcoincconsultancy (or who ever was the last administrator) proves that they are still in control of these coins, and makes them available for people to withdraw.Cam.Edit: SpellingEdit: whoever the owner is... Yepo... Whenever you are in Melbourne; make sure you send me a message  This could be a great way to attract new $$$ into the bitcoin economy...  above market rate interest rates  as the exchange gets more liquid the rates go down...Swaps mean that those buying bitcoin or USD on leverage pay the interest to those providing the liquidity.What will happen in the future is that the starfish will never exist again as those trying to buy new long (or short in a bare market) positions will be facing extremely high swap costs.  (meaning there is a huge intensive for people to provide more liquidly to to fund those positions).It is really win-win for everyone  this is bound to help solve the liquidity problems on bitcoinica... and a very natural and smart solutions...Z  +1 on the swaps   I've made a quick comment on the P2P Cypto Exchange thread as a OT developer. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=62879.msg735219#msg735219
This is an interesting project.  However p2p trade systems have cost; that is the cost of protecting from double spending.  Either you have a distributed verification network (like bitcoin with the block generation), or you have some sort of trusted centralized user that 'clears' the trades...  (this is normally called a 'clearing house').If by some miracle you have come up with an algorithm to solve this problem in a distributed p2p manner; it would be wonderful if you could produce a white paper that explains how you propose to solve this doubble spending problem.I'm working on the Open Transactions project;  this project is building secure (and centralized, but to a server of your choice, in the future we can have a group of federated trusted servers);  the market software executes in a similar mechanism to the Bitcoin scripting.  (through the use of cryptographic market contracts).I really hope the best for your project, except I'm really scared if it doesn't have the well-thought-out cryptographic foundations (that we are still working on for the Open Transactions project); you will be opening your users up to easy scamming. The bitcoin markets are like the speculators dream... it is like a really good soap opera.  Except without the manipulation by the central bank. Congratulations for saying absolutely nothing. (Other than saying that people are unsure about what is going (or not going to) happen.)     The market just cannot make up its mind... this is so atypical for bitcoin.

BIP 16. or BIP 17.Either way.  I think that we should all take a chill pill; keep the debates technical, not emotional, and grow very thick hides.EDIT: Spelling That is the problem... it takes up extra space in the chain... where the sender pays the fees; not the spender.This is bad; as say mtgox would only except 'plain' bitcoin addresses.

"Bitcoin always goes down on the weeken, get your cheap coins on the weekend!" Lots of people have been complaining about how the bitcoin economy has not been fundamentally getting larger.  For example paying hosting with bitcoin, or buying your tv with bitcoin.One of the markets that was said to be very attractive for bitcoin is online gambling; poker and other games.Well I want to propose that bitcoinica provides as much fundamentals to the bitcoin economy as a poker site of the same size.Trades at matched locally.  (same as with a poker site)There is the potential to make lots of money, or loose lots. (no different to a poker site)People play against each other trying to game the market. (again no different to poker)Transaction fees (and spreads) pay for the operation of the site.  (no different to binds in poker)I propose that just purely as a form of gambling; bitcoinica is doing a great service to the bitcoin community. The sad thing isn't that you lost the coins because of the margin; but because you lost them from an artificial limit (the mtgox daily withdraw limit). rotflEdit: made it a bit more bimbo!
RALLLLLY!!BACKWARDS!!! I really like the idea of having a full featured scripting engine; and using resource tracking to decide if the script is valid or not.  This is where the cost lies, before the fact static analysis is nice however the real cost is in the difficulty to execute a script -  not what functions the script implements. lawl  look at da, shit! I think that the bitcoin market is going to be MUCH more wise going into a big rally a 2nd time...  There is so-many people who are willing to sell and keep the price stable now.The big rally up to 32 was a big testing ground...  Now we have been there we know what to expect.A healthy (new) market may make an mistake (the bubble).  However it doesnt make the same mistake twice. Anecdotally, I have been talking to quite a few of the established bitcoin-shops; it seems that buying volume is has been slowly increasing over the last month.I really am thinking that it will take more and more bitcoin to drop the price back down to 2.5  At some point it will take such a large % of the total market cap to shift the price large amounts.Ideally we want the collected order-books to have move than the total issued Bitcoin holdings so we know if every Bitcoin was spent how far the price would drop. (Not that would ever happen). The entire E-Cat device is a hoax.Here is a good block, debunking their claims: http://blog.newenergytimes.com/ One feature that I would love to see is a 'pgp fingerprint and 'pgp key' fields within the user profile.If the user has supplied a pgp key, on submission of a new post or editing an old post, the forum provides well-formatted version of the raw post data for singing.  The user then can upload a .sig file as an attachment to the post.This would be extremely useful for announcements; the forum software could even automatically verify that the submitted signature is valid. No.  Most certainly not.  You sound even more noob now than before.We need to be talking "performance per watt" numbers here.The best fpga may be able to produce 200Mh/s @ 4W or equiv. 1Gh/s @ 20 W (Still far more efficient than a GPU).While a fully custom asic would produce 1Gh/s @ 2W.   This is 10x more energy efficient.Secondly, lets look at the cost 'per-chip' once you exclude the one-time tooling costs.5 fpga's @ 200Hh/s fpga's would account for $20 each... so you are looking at $100 total cost, for the best case.1 asic @ 1Gh/s would cost around $1 each to manufacture (aka cost of a 4M transistor chip on modem wafer technology).You see... for the same hashing speed.  Fpga's work out to be 100x more expensive to manufacture, and 10x more expensive to run than fully custom asic's.   Also.  To make matters worse for your augment, I'm taking the best-case numbers for the fpga... and the average-case numbers for the asic.I do not understand how the can be 'almost the same thing' when there manufacturing costs are 100x and performance is 10x worse.  (On first analysis, that would sound like quite a large difference).Well anyway; it was fun showing you to be a retard again.  When you post something like this you sound like a complete retard... I'm sorry, they both serve purposes. Hmmm... I was?  Please point me to any thread that I say that ASIC are anything but insanely profitable...The maths goes:200K for development + testing.Do a small run of 200,000 1Gh/s chips @ around 4M transistors each.They cost $1 ea.  So that is 200K + 600K setup.Total 800K for a dedicated ASIC run.Building into board, and packaging maybe 1$ each.  So total 1.2MYou will put 20 boards in a box and sell the box.  20Gh/s @ 40W.   Sale price of $1000 per box.That will mean that you produce 10M income on say 1.2M investment.  To break even you only need to sell 20% of your production...  It is insanely profitable. Ya... I think that this is the key point... Bitcoin isn't going to go up until the fundamentals dictate the need for a higher price.The economy size is slowly growing to the size that supports the current value (maybe $5 atm... eg. equiv 35M market cap.)  Once the underlying market grows in size larger than the price represented on mtgox, then more bitcoin's will (on average) be withdrawn from mtgox than deposited.  (They are more valuable elsewhere).   The will tighten up the entire trading market; this will be reflected on the price.  (Rarer coins fetch higher prices).For a big rally, we need the competition for the bitcoins  The most natural way we can get more competition are more investors going after the same pool?I think that both is happening:  as bitcoins are getting valued more elsewhere, the flow of bitcoins into mtgox and other trading sites will slow down, causing the pool to get smaller;  and that more investors are slowly taking an interest in holding bitcoins.The real question is when the market will start feeling tight. The market cap of bitcoin is over 60M USD.  Since more than half the coins ever to be made are still yet to be made, it is completely feasible that a group of people will want to mine/spend the 1.2M USD capital needed in producing an ASIC miner.100% return of investment could easily be reached in one year... even if the bitcoin price drops to $1. I just want to put my 2-cents in.Previously I have argued that this forum should remain as free as possible.    However, now I'm forced to re-consider my opinion.  I believe that we should be giving more power and discretion and trust to the moderators in this forum.I believe that there is nothing more dis-hearting that limiting the powers that the mods have, yet still expecting them to carry out an effective job.Overall the question boils down to 'do we trust the moderators or not I for one certainly do.  They have shown time-after-time to be very reliable and level headed.  Allowing the moderators to ban accounts, see the IP address, move and delete stupid topics, and the whole host of standard moderation powers would make this forum far better.  It also would be a vote of confidence in those doing the good work already.@theymos, I really hope you can choose to empower your moderators, otherwise they will lose heart and you will not have any quality ones anymore. This thread also ignores the fact that Bruce has been nothing but honest in his business dealings with the bitcoin community so far.When you get down to it, everyone has a past; some people have cleaner pasts than others.   Also people grow and learn from life experiences.For myself, I'm happy to give him the benefit of the doubt.  If Bruce continues to be honest with his bitcoin dealings I see no why things that happened many years ago should stop valid honest business now.It seems like that many people on this forum have been on a witch hunt and once they have found any dirt (if it is really dirt), have claimed that this must be the end of a good reputation.  When in-fact these 'revelations' have no direct importance to the good dealing that have happened over the last 10 months. Everyday that goes past and bitcoin doesnt drop down so low; I'm getting more and more bullish.Something's Gotta Give.I don't believe that the big investors have withdrawn their funds from mogos and the other trading sites... I suspect that those funds are just sitting there waiting for the next rally.  However the market is much wiser now, I think that once the goods and services economy finally reaches a certain threshold we will see the next big massive rally.  (It is clear that the global investment interest in bitcoin is much more than $80M USD now)It is all about picking the bottom and buying big.Lets see... I don't want to commit to a time-frame, but my gut is starting to get excited again. Yep, it is still happening   The enitre ptoject has taken a bit more time than expected... We hope to have something to release to the public in arround 2 weeks. When all the dust settles, whoever dose the research and writes a novel based upon these events has the prospective of making a lot of BTC.We have lots of accusations with no evidence.  To me that is disgusting and says lots for the characters of those making the accusations.I personally believe people should be treated an innocent until proven guilty.   From what is presented, we dont even have the beginnings of proof. So because Bruce is gay (so what), that automatically means that he wants to have sex with children?Meeting somebody doesn't atomically mean that they want to have sex! Overall who cares if it is a gay-friendly hotel or not... it makes 0 difference.All of you points are rather stupid imho.
wtf is going on here...Being gay is nothing more different than being black...   I think that some people here should crawl back into their caves and go back to the stone age. @ Garrett Burgwardt, sorry I have already bought a laptop (Lenovo X220).I have arrived in Barcelona!  I'm loving spain so much!It would be great to meetup with the bitcoiners in the loverly city. PM me for my mobile number  @ptshamrock:  sounds great!  I'll be in Germany maybe in 4 weeks.@lagios: hmm... don't have plans to go to Athens, but if I do travel there I'll certainly send you a pm. dang boys, (and bitcoin girls also)... I'm in the UK!    shoot me a email with your numbers! @TheLaundryManYou make a post stating your pgp key... yet you don't sign your post with it... I'm flying into Heathrow, from there I'm planning to stick in the London area.  I'll only be in the UK for 5 days... Great! I always wanted to go to Sweden... lets see what happens  yo yo... updated the op.  I'll be leaving for the UK in 1 day. who said that the value of the bitcoins is judged by how cheaply (or expensive) they are to transfer between each-other...Bitcoins value come from the fact that the barriers to disrupting the transactions are huge!   It requires a huge investment in bitcoin mining to start mucking around with other peoples transactions.  We have a decent throughput into the black markets, but there's a limit to how much that can grow before those black markets either get shut down or implode under the weight of their own politics and infighting.Interested to know what you think...[/quote]There isn't even close to saturation with black markets... The decentralized nature of bitcoin means that many interdependent markets can exist without each becoming too large.  I expect that black and grey markets to set the minimum price of bitcoin over the next year or so.Bitcoin's won't go down in value, as these black an grey markets will have a vested interest in tightening up the supply of coins.  It will be interesting to see how much they grow... It wouldn't be surprising to me to see the markets go up to $30 or $100, just from the pressure the black markets, (bitcoins will just seep out of mtgox and tradehill and otherwise... and not be re-deposited (other than those who mine).Either way... it is going to be very interesting. Hey Bruce, you are sounding a bit shrill.  It is better to not jump to conclusions without sold evidence.For people looking for places to store bitcoin, I personalty recommend: Trade Hill: https://www.tradehill.com/ or MtGox: https://mtgox.com/ as e-wallet services. Code:-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1            From the desk of Tom Williams, operator of MyBitcoin.com                          For immediate release.There are a lot of unanswered questions floating around on the Bitcoin forum and other places about the recent Mtgox password leak, and theft from the MyBitcoin system.I will attempt to answer as many of the questions and concerns as best as I can in order to silence the rumor-mill once and for all.As many of you already know, Mtgox was hacked and its password file was leaked. As soon as we heard about the leak we were closely monitoring the system for abnormal activity, and we didn't see any.At first glance, we didn't see any hard evidence that a password leak had even occurred. There was just a lot of speculation to an SQL injection vulnerability in Mtgox's site. A few clients of ours had informed us of the forum threads, and we watched them carefully.The following morning a client of ours sent us the download link to the leaked Mtgox password file. We prompty downloaded the file, put up a warning on the main page, and disabled the login.We attempted to line up usernames from the leak, and we found a lot of matching ones. We started locking down all of those accounts using a script that we had to have written at a moment's notice. It was during this time that we noticed a flurry of spends happening. Yes, even with the site disabled.The attacker had active sessions open to the site. We quickly flushed them and the spends stopped abruptly. We disabled the SCI, all payment forwarding, and all receipt URL traffic on all of the usernames in the Mtgox leak. We proceeded to change the password on every account where the username matched our system's database. PGP-signed emails went out to all of the accounts that we changed the password on. If an account didn't have an email address or had already been compromised we put up a bulletin. (Email addresses were mandatory when we opened our service initially, but people complained that it wasn't truly anonymous so we made them optional. Unfortunately this makes contacting a security-compromised customer impossible.)An investigation was conducted at that time, and we determined that the attacker had opened up a session to each active user/password pair ahead of time, solved the captcha, and used some sort of bot to maintain a connection so our system wouldn't timeout on the session. It was likely his intent to gain access to more accounts than he did, but as soon as he noticed that we had changed the main page of the site he sprung into action by sending a flurry of spends.(Before you ask: no, we don't limit logins per IP address. We can't. We have a lot of users that come in from Tor and I2P that all appear to share the same source IP address.)We've concluded that around 1% of the users on the leaked Mtgox password file had their Bitcoins stolen on MyBitcoin. It is unfortunate, and a horrible experience for the Bitcoin community in general.The IP address that the attacker used was a Tor exit node and the spends were to an address that is outside of our system.Now to address the rumors:No, our database wasn't compromised. We had a 3rd party company audit our site for SQL injection attacks and we passed. (We did, however, have one XSS hole in the address book page last month that would allow an attacker to insert fake entries into a customer's address book. It was promptly fixed and offending address book entries were purged. Not a single customer had spent to the fake address book entries.) Every line of code was audited last month. Literally line by line audited by professionals, and it was deemed safe.No, this site isn't being ran by some amateur that just learned how to program computers. It was created by seasoned programmers that understand security.Yes, we use password encryption. We are currently using SHA-256, but since the recent Mtgox hack we will be upgrading that to something stronger. It's surprising how many sites still use MD5, even though it was broken years ago. It is my personal opinion that MD5 be deprecated from modern operating systems.We also use whole-disk level encryption on every single one of our servers. When you fail a disk in a NOC and a level 1 technician replaces it does he wipe the disk before the RMA/tossing it in the garbage? Not usually! We know these mistakes happen, so we take precautions. Any and all servers with an IP KVM on them are ran in secure console mode. The root passwords are required even for single user mode. All disk keys are held off-site and were never generated anywhere near the internet. All server passwords are unique per server and per user, of course. Only two technicians have access to the secure servers. This access is over a VPN and we only use secured workstations running Linux and BSD to access them.We use BSD servers with MAC, immutable flags, jails, PAX, SSP, randomized mmap, secure level, a WAF, a DDoS mitigation and alert system - -- the works. Like I said earlier. We are not amateurs. In fact, combined we have over 30 years of experience in the payment processing (credit card arena) industry.A large amount of the Bitcoin holding is in cold (offline) storage. We only have a percentage of the holding available hot. This is done for obvious reasons.Going forward we are implementing a 2-factor login system, user-configurable spend limits, better session token tumbling, and a bunch of new SCI features.Wishing the Bitcoin community all the best and a swift recovery, and sincerely yours,Tom Williams-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG/MBC v1.0iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJOAki5AAoJEJ+5g06lAnqF3tcH/0QNKf7aBEg08vML9MCkwTjFVCoTAPzVaVsdbZOqiRwE2/6420tcFZrsWTXYZYbjXckEiYrl7/DQ2XsLyhk4W567T1sOCmpH99Z2/VAvTfAd5obRTEGpMQ0SLIrfznyc8MmG4C1GvtVUr4jM79asPmRYjsIn7v53o9Ra1sN3QcvMskRUU1JmqfqU6MlJrYwXrtc/P9Tjm7D3AtsjfvJRX12Z9g5y1N+zRGVpp7OK35VFnfmIKtOOtb3IMgG5EhiUllsoXKfz1eE08v4f4d0aQstL+HGMi3PktL1HBpIRni2n4MAaIXq/EyzxDSzkSHp6v032H70c1kkUibL//QNxQuM==VaXC-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----Public Key "MyBitcoin LLC (SCI Verification Key) <nobody@mybitcoin.com>":Code:-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)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=cUT5-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Result (gpg -v):Code:gpg: Signature made 06/23/11 05:55:37 AUS Eastern Standard Time using RSA key ID A5027A85gpg: using PGP trust modelgpg: Good signature from "MyBitcoin LLC (SCI Verification Key) <nobody@mybitcoin.com>"gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.Primary key fingerprint: FB59 EE27 E803 FB68 EF30  3F5A 9FB9 834E A502 7A85gpg: textmode signature, digest algorithm SHA1 I think that many people have lost a bit of BTC on mybitcoin...

Yay for Gay people... They use PayPal... and get scammed!(nb... please note, that strait people also use paypal, and get scammed!) That is crazy... PHP sucks for security and is very hard to get properly stable for non-trivial projects.I would think that a full python implementation of bitcoin would be best for web-hosting. so the bitcoin sun is dead?  You guys were just starting to build up a bit of brand reputation...  
come to Australia!  The land of the labour government and taxation.  But the people (on the most-part) are good.     yeah... I have often wondered... Working on Bitcoin project.Do not have a huge budget, however if you find this sort of thing fun and want to help the community please inquire.Edit: using an existing codebase: https://github.com/da2ce7/bitcoin.com.au Oh I will! That will be 10 BTC thanks! Make sure you pick at least one character in each group:Lowercase: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzUppercase: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZNumber: 1234567890Symbol: `~!@#$%^&*()-_=+\|[{]};:'",<.>/?

It is weird as a 10 digit password [a-Z][0-9][!-~] has a search space of 6.05 x 10^19 and could be cracked in 10 weeks by the Bitcoin network...  Secure passwords are much more secure than you expect. WINRAR is fine... providing you use a secure password...The password search space for a Uppercas, Lowercase, Digit, and Symbols 12 digit password is 5.46 x 10^23That would take over 100 years at one hundred trillion guesses per second.  (10x the power of the entire bitcoin network).useful link: https://www.grc.com/%5Chaystack.htm see how the original namecoin announcemnt release was pgp singed: https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=6017.0 Sorry:  Here is a good guide: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secure_TradingPGP is the common name for the type of signature... normally you use gpg to make it.There is a large list of PGP identities here: http://bitcoin-otc.com/viewgpg.phpIt is helpful if you have some trust built up before releasing executables. can you please provide SHA256 hash of the file.  and a pgp signature. Should check out what Stefan is developing for bitcoinjs.  Using a bitcoin master key. @Stefan ThomasThe Bitcoin Deterministic Wallet that described in the video is far better than the one that I described on the forum: https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=11665.0Would you please make a basic spec so we can plan to implement it in other bitcoin clients.  @lzsaver, lol Correct the standard 'inflation' is regarding price... However the OP was clearly talking about the growth of the monetary supply, (that is in 'inflation' in the generic sense).It is useful to clarify what sort of 'inflation' we are talking about otherwise the OP post would be clearly incorrect by common definitions.  Since the OP was clearly talking about the monetary supply we should at least talk about it by it's correct label.... (no-matter how rarely it is used in common literature). How can one have a rational discussion with out defining what they are talking about? here here!   people are again painfully mixing up 'price inflation/deflation' and 'monetary inflation/deflation'Bitcoin is in strong price deflation (things are getting cheaper in relative terms to bitcoin).Bitcoin is also in strong monetary inflation (bitcoins are getting less rare, or the monetary supply is getting diluted by the issuing of new currency).  Dang... I was just about to comment that a properly set-up window 7 x64, using limited privilege user, and efs for private data can be very secure. Yep: "It's the opportunity cost baby!"  
8 connections is normal... sounds like the peer that you are connected to only has 130K blocks. what a junk poll... junk post, junk user unemployed Yep! It is easy:  see the proposal that I wrote here: https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=11665.0   In the long run... this is a mutually assured destruction.  As the owner of the first transaction will just make a new competing transaction with higher fees than the doubble spend...  If this is an automated process, very quickly the frees reach 100% of the transaction.  This is a good tool to make as an disincentive of stealing coins (where you want to stop the thief to have any coins).Not such a good attack to a shop, as the shop will implement a system  that automatically increases the fee until 100%.  (and bans the customer).  The person trying to get the coins back will loose 100% also. MagicalTux,As a bitcoin member that has dealt with you before, I want to say that over time you have built up my trust.I want to offer you my support for to help make MtGox great again!Please know that many of the older members of this community are here to support you and appreciate the tireless work that you put into the success of bitcoin.Best of Luck, and Godspeedda2ce7 @FreeMoney, I really like this idea... the bad guy must both steal the coins AND put in a massive transaction fee.Whomever owns the wallet will put the transaction fee up to 100% before letting the adversary keep the coins.  It would be reasonable (and rational) that the owner of the coins could put the fee at 120% or more.You could even have code that automatically detects an unauthorized spend and creates a transaction of a higher fee automatically to a new address.  The adversity will automatically rise the fee also... so the fee will quickly get to 100% / 100%This will kill much the incentive for stealing somebodies btc.Problem... make a new transaction after paying somebody... That has a fee higher fee.  Means that double spends are easy. Open Transactions is the single most important thing that the bitcoin community needs to adopt to be successful.  Where bitcoin deals with global 'value' and is good as a standard... The area where we fall-down is in personal trust based transactions.I have been a long supporter of OT (Open Transactions), and plan to release software based upon it.OT isn't a easy concept to get your around your head... however once you 'work it out' it changes your prospective of how finance should be done. https://www.grc.com/%5Chaystack.htmuseful!  From this I should be secure! But sometimes the free-market will save also... as suddenly those who make good sites are at a competitive advantage. 1.  I do not trust the police.2.  Nobody forced anyone to use MtGox!  The issue here is the one between MtGox and the hacker...Maybe you should go: "Oh I was really stupid. I used a fucking weak password, and I put all my money in one place, I must be a genius!" I plan to continue using MtGox... MagicalTux has been nothing more than completely impeccable with my dealings. You are evil. It is peoples fair choice if they choose to use MTGox after this... If you forceful dissolve MTGox you are forcing people who might want to freely choose to use it not to.In other words, you say that you can make a better choice than me where I should place my money.  So you are evil. Everyone has become so malicious.  The hate that people are typing is revolting.  NO BODY forced anyone to use MtGox!  It was their own fair choice.  Their own fair risk.I would ask that people give MagicalTux a break... He has been doing a wonderful job considering.   I would ask you also to stop making judgements with no evidence.However, this forum has become a troll pit.  Where people just say the most hateful and non-productive things, 'just because they can.' No... the mistake that you have made is not doing any research before your posted... Not searching the forum for the 1000 other threads that is topic has already been debated to death with.Everyday... we get the same people declaring the same 'arguments' and the same 'solutions' to the said problems of the deflationary spiral... lack of demurrage, hoarding, no inflation.  These come from a key lack of understanding about the natural differences between debt based money or asset based.Both viewpoints are covered in the wiki article:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deflationary_spiralHowever,  I always believe that a non-deflationary currency will always be at an economic disadvantage to the deflationary one. As the deflationary currency will be more attractive.  Upon market saturation... the change of the fixed amount currencies value will be in DIRECT RELATIONSHIP with the change of the total economy size... This is extremely healthy, as only very profitable ventures will get money.Inflation based currencies (esp debt based ones), create an artificial demand for growth. Causing most of the world's problems... unsustainable growth is unsustainable. Only linear growth can be sustainable.  Exponential growth, will always end in disaster. Trolling how-to for bitcoin forum:1.  Show why hoarding is bad for debt based fiat currencies.  (aka deflationary spiral)2.  Show that both debt based fiat currencies, gold and bitcoin are money.3.  4.  Hoarding must be bad for all types of money!5.  We need to change bitcoin so people don't hoard it!!!! Trolling how-to for bitcoin forum:1.  Show why hoarding is bad for debt based fiat currencies.2.  Show that both debt based fiat currencies, gold and bitcoin are money.3.  4.  Hoarding must be bad for all types of money!6.  We need to change bitcoin so people don't hoard it!!!! MaDDDog, is a Mad Dog Troll   * da2ce7 isn't worried... as I use a SECURE password... you know... I also leave 10 kg of gold in a safe under my bed... the password is: 1234. On first read I think that Allinvain, was stupid.  However I do not think that this is hoax or the CIA.We have NO evidence to link any of this to the CIA (or any other government or non government organization).If Allinvain had indeed lost 25K BTC, he would be in a very fragile mental state, it would be extremely unlikely that he would make rational and fully consistent posts.1.  Allinvain was in shock2.  It is rational to regiser a forum account and not post... Becasue if you are registered you can tell what posts are new... (very typical for a lurker)3.  Allinvain isn't the greatest geek out there, and has miss-understandings with computers.  This is NOT mutually exclusive with being a early adopter.4.  From point 3.  Allinvain isn't a hardcore geek... so he didn't keep a secure system to hold his bitcoins... Again Fair.Everything in Allinvain's story can be rationally explained.  What ever happened to 'guilty till proven innocent?'There have been some conspiracies in history... however this isn't one of them...  If it was, it has backfired... It has created a strong awareness of the VALUE of bitcoin, now people say "Wow, Bitcoin's are worth so much that I need to protect them like GOLD, or MONEY!"  Now people are going to think bitcoin as something of value and protect it!
Of-course #bitcoin-gaming is hosted on the Freenode servers, more info: http://freenode.net/ New IRC channel for the gamers among us...A place to hangout and talk... and talk about games!  (and how bitcoin changes the gaming industry)   Sure... Bitcoin regards the longest valid chain as the correct version of the truth.  If you change bitcoin so the fees remain at 50 BTC forever, that would create a invalid chain for every bitcoin user that has not agreed with your modification.Even if you had 100x the hashing power on your '50 forever' chain... that chain will still be rejected by every client that has not adopted your changed rules. lol... as soon as you change the rules you create a fork, it doesn't matter if the fork has a shorter or longer chain... The original block chain will remain intact, and will keep on going happily. I would love you to make a compatible fork of bitcoin... That makes the coins I own TWICE as valuable as I can spend them on both block-chains!So what you are really creating is a HUGE and UNFAIR advantage to the early adopters.(note) the coins in the bitcoin block chain will remain much more valuable.  Therefore, not twice as valuable... but you get the point. @ S3052, I'm really missing your high quality analysis... is there any chance that you will do public reports again? I have made an order... yet still have not received any confirmation email. Twitter is where all the action is at. You are mixing up trespass (getting the original copy of the video), and copyright (the controlling of copies of your 'work' outside your property). We should make the min fee 0.00001   Oh!   We should move to a new UNIT!  the unit of of a 'Bitcoin' is defined in the official source code:Code:static const int64 COIN = 100000000;This should STAY THE SAME!See: Code:static const int64 COIN = 100000000;static const int64 CENT = 1000000;we can just define a new one:Code:static const int64 COIN = 100000000;static const int64 CENT = 1000000;static const int64 mBTC = 100000;static const int64 XBT  = 100;and so on...The reason NOT to 'shift the decimal point' is because it will require UPDATING every codified system that uses bitcoins... It will aslo cause huge ammouts of confusion for those who use old clients.   Keep the same units..For a real-life example where we use smaller every-day units... just look at: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tesla_%28unit%29 Since we have like NO interest... I'm gonna #FAIL on this thread, and re-invest these 100 BTC into some other projects. It is sad that you get put in a cage if you don't pay your tax... but that is life. If you navigate away from the page, then navigate back, the site will re-try the download... Don't close your brower, as the cookie is lost and you will be asked to pay again!Otherwise good points.  We certanly will consider them! Thanks for using the bitcoin service! However there are a few things to note:We are in the process of doing a major re-development of the backend to the bitcoin service. When we release the new-website, we will be moving over to a dedicated server, the site should be much faster, and more reliable.  However, it will not be backwards compatible as we are fundamentally changing the addressing system.Do not worry, any balances will be ported over to the new system, and we will give you ample time and warning to move the files over before we stop the old VPS server.Bugs such as when files do not download properly on IE will be fixed.  In addition, users will be able to store Bitcoins in their account.Expect the fees to be lower and capability for larger downloads! @interfect, I think that you should do some reading up on the Logistic Function: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Logistic_function A drop of the USD's value v.s. bitcoin? Hmm we need a website called 'what fee will I need'  where it looks at the waiting time and calcualtes the fee that you need to pay to get your transaction validated in reasonable time.  There should be no artificial limits to what people can set their clients fee to. I agree... we shouldn't have any of this anti-spam rules... it would be based upon what the market can sustain for fees.  The market will quickly set the minimum fee, naturally... Of course... that would be the end of free transactions also... But when were transactions ever 'free'?If I was better at coding I'd create a 'no-min-fee' client.
because, sometimes I like being a bitch?Sometimes it is more fun to troll than to be friendly...   After all, half of these newbie posts are actually troll posts.  They never lead to a rational debate but create FUD on the forum.If you take a troll post straight to the sewer... A: there are going to be less trolls.  B: new posters will make more effort to at-least do some research before making such posts. I'm half childish... and half bored... I guess It comes down to the fact that I have extensively researched the above 'transaction fees only' system and have come up to with two simple observations:First:We cannot tell where the natural fee-support of the network will be without a full game-theory analysis... that is both non-trivial, and impossible because of the wildly changing dynamics that the future holds.Second:'Security' is a relative term... who is to say that the network will not be secure with a extremely low hash-rate?  For example, you may have a locked up house in a bad neighbourhood, and be less 'secure' than the completely open house in a safe neighbourhood.The bitcoin network is like that.... the free market automatically put as LITTLE resources into securely as necessary.   There might be OTHER barriers to attacking the bitcoin network in the future, so extremely low fees and unlimited block size is still counted as a very secure system...The thing with every single thread about this system that claims that the mining fees are unsustainable make a huge assumptions on the ENVIRONMENT that bitcoin will be in the future... the fact is WE DON'T KNOW, and CANNOT KNOW!I have always maintained that we should be focused on making bitcoin as secure as possible NOW not 50 years in the future. lulz oh you are so funny.     It may be good to make a bitcoin legal charity that provides legal support to individuals attacked by the state. Welcome to the BITCOIN NOOB ALERT!!!! Go to https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page for your bitcoin schooling so you may not make such a huge fool of yourself next time! True, very true... You don't feel very intelligent on this forum (so many geniuses within our ranks).... until you read the "oh noes deflation!" threads. My Vote:PLATO https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=10202.msg147710#msg147710------PLATO: 1 Topic Is LOCKED! https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=10202.40user name, and link to vote to vote for the winner. nazgulnarsil and Sweft,  you create to-many lulz lulzzz of making yourselves look like complete retards on the internet.Edit:  tl;drnazgulnarsil, Sweft -1 reputation You mum is GOOD for bitcoin... providing she doesn't charge to high. Other than you being retarded and not being able to use the 'forum search' function... (hint: it comes under the name 'search')You make the assumption that because the hash-rate MAY be slower... the network differently is less secure.What you fail to take into account is that the 'security environment' e.g. the total ammount of capital needed to 'attack' the network might make an attack prohibitively expensive...  even if the 'normal' hash rate is extremely low.For example the hash rate might normally be 1/1000 the rate it is now.... (maybe)... but there is 1 000 000x the current hash rate available on demand if an attack is detected...Therefore an adversary MUST gather 1 000 000x the current hash-rate to attack the network... even tho the normal hash-rate is 1 000 000 000 times lower.  (and the network is still secure). What is a maybe is that you don't understand how bitcoin works...What a definite is that you are not God, therefore you cannot 'know' the future. There is nothing stopping the user from writing down a password.I'd personalty recommend passwords like:"da2ce7 is super sexy and a mad dog, I like to eat!!! cows are cool!!"something like that nobody else would make... and and since brute-forcing is so hard... it is infeasible to make through a search. If x was a random secret number, there is something that MUST be remembered, why not just add the random number to your own password... the point of the nounce is to:1.  save time (this means that we can use a much stronger password strengthening function, if we are not doing it every time, this makes searching through passwords much slower for an attacker... but not slow for a regular user that remembers their nonce)2.  check if the user didn't mistype the password.We SHOULD provide a option where the user put a 'account name' and 'some random number'  that is mixed into the password. A in a standard way... however these options should be optional.It is the user's fault if they use an insecure password... like anything we should do the best we can to warn the user that they are being stupid... (eg a weak password)... but shouldn't stop them being stupid. That is the point... you use a random-strong password... I guess you cannot have your cake and eat it.I mean, if you want a system that works no-matter what computer you decide to use the password on... swapping computers will be nothing more than using your password on a different computer. I believe that it is the same difficulty as a standard difficulty of 1Yes... but the point is that people use strong passwords (weak passwords are weak).  It is also very expensive to check passwords if the as the password strengthening function takes a bit of time to compute. Possible better password strengthening function than sha256http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdfhttp://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt-1.1.6.tgz Thanks gmaxwell! Please note!  This is not to 'replace' traditional wallets... but to complement them as an option. The use of bitcoin requires that either users store their private data in a wallet file in clear text or encrypted, this wallet file still needs protection.However, there is only one sort of information within the wallet file that is important the private keys.Currently the private keys are generated from random data.  However, there is nothing stopping us creating these same keys deterministically.This is what I propose:Bitcoin should have the option to load a deterministic wallet.Creating the Deterministic Wallet:1.  User enters a new password (of good quality) into the load/create a deterministic wallet dialogue:Code:A = sha256 ( password )B(x) = sha256 ( x )C(x) = sha256 ( A + B(x) )Find x, where C(x) < 0x00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000(x starts from 0, and increases) 2.  Bitcoin then supplies the user with a nonce, base58(x), that the user can supply to both:   a.  save time in finding the nonce again   b.  check if the password  nonce combo is correct3.  Bitcoin then generates 1000 (or more at the users option) addresses:Code:D = C(x) , where x = nonceKey1 made from sha256(D)Key2 made from sha256(sha256(D))4.  The bitcoin client then rescans the block chain for any transactions based upon the newly generated keys.5.  Upon close, the bitcoin client forgets everything, including the password. (optionally we have a setting for the software to store the nonce for convenience) This system means that if the user keeps the password secret (and, optionally, nonce to save time/check correct entry).  The there is NO RECORD or DIGITAL DATA that needs to be kept on any computer (other than the block chain).This is far more secure than the current system It is also resistant to brute-force attack, as there is a fair effort required to check through various password.Edit:  The Goal of this system is so that anyone can use their wallet on any computer   no need to backup anything.
I have a project for a modification/patch to the official Bitcoin client.Please contact me: da2ce7@gmail.comor @da2ce7 on Freenode.netPGP is essential. (for communication purposes) We have been looking at lots of different ways of defining the Bitcoin Block/Tx IPC Protocol.I think that using Google Protocol Buffers would be the most obvious protocol to define it with.If anyone has professional protocol specification writing experience please contact me.. or pop into #btcfnWe have enough funds for some moderate compensation in bitcoin...  However this work is 50% charity. Follow the guide here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secure_TradingThis guide describes a way of trading that makes it very hard to scam. On a fundamental note: USD is soon going to go into hyperinflation: http://www.shadowstats.com/article/hyperinflation-special-report-2011.pdf Maybe by real goods and services? A mixing service that uses Blinded Tokens would also provide real anonymity. oooh... don't' do that... you get into all sorts of consistency issues...  We don't' support that yet... Bitcoin is beta software... and multiple shared balances has not been implemented yet. I have been thinking about this a bit... The best way to securely store bitcoin is to create a special bitcoin client that accepts 'seed data' when making the initial keys.What happens is the client first generates a 1024 bit number that is used as for the 'seed data' for the creation of all the secret keys in the future.This user prints out this seed data file on acid free paper... and stores in a secure location? A fire safe maybe.The Bitcoins are either generated, or sent to some of the keys made from the seed data.... once those transactions have been completed... All the data is deleted, Including the bitcoin keys.When the user wants to spend the data... He scans in the seed data into the computer... re-generates all the bitcoin private keys (say the first 1000 keys) .  Then, rescans the block-chain for any transactions.This same concept could be used for a more secure version bitbill... as a small code on the inside could represent as many private keys as owner wanted.  (some private keys could need the seed data + an extra password to create)...  However there would be no way of knowing.  The user could have a 'card balance' (on the first key generated) and a secret balance that can only be found by entering a passphase. except that USB flash-drives have a data half-life of between 2 and 10 years... (depending on the quality/type of flash chips used). What you is doing is better solved by Open Transactions: https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/Using the bitcoin topology for a central system is not logical. Either you agree that old transactions have a 'cost' to the network, so there would be a benefit for some miners to forget these coins...Or there is no 'cost' to old transactions... there for the entire idea of demurrage is stupid. Nice...   I'll send you the payment... I really feel bad about not updating this post earlier.  Well done Kiba! 12pbw3H1cLb6QHVMrd3g72smLT3gyyyhWqAdded your site to my sig also!      Hmm, I read both... The Bitcoin sun is nice as I can just get all the news round-up in one hit... except it really should be on paper, something that you read when having your morning coffee.  I that an iPad app would be great... (for those who have one of those stupid apple-jail products).The Bitcoin Weekly, is cool as it is very minimalist and 'just works'...  I that there is much that The Bitcoin Sun could learn from such a site. +1 there are some really good ones hidden in those PDF's...@TheBitcoinSun... why so slow?? Get your editors to upload their articles to the site already!  And get a new CSS theme while you are at it! I'm just not sure what to think.... It reminds me of the opening videos of the original Command & Conquer. Have you seen the trade page: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/TradeThat page used to be only 20 sites not that long ago... the 'real stuff' economy is growing at a very fast rate also... It just takes time to build a website or provide a service... Money is many times more liquid than websites... so it is to be expected that it will flow to the low points first (eg. BTC). Well they have a twitter:  @TheBitcoinSuna RSS: http://thebitcoinsun.com/feed/atomI really like The Sun'. Quality bitcoin news is hard to come-by and is going to in importance as the bitcoin community grows.Edit: added the website to my sig.  But seriously, your website is like... really bad:  my favourite news website is: http://www.theaustralian.com.au/12pbw3H1cLb6QHVMrd3g72smLT3gyyyhWq You would stop mining only if you directed the leftover funds directly into bitcoin thorough an exchange.  There are some interesting economic dynamics:Electricity bills are not instantaneous, but on credit.  So all the miners are really taking out bitcoin futures that the price isn't going to be worth less when paying the electricity bill.Miners also need to take into account the cost of buying the coins 'now' v.s. mining the coins  on credit.A rational miner would work out what had a better return:  Buying coins now from an exchange v.s. mining now and paying for the coins later in your electricity bill. here is my charting:http://hostinga.imagecross.com/image-hosting-02/5960chart_longterm_lines.png
My ass is particularly significant, only because it is so dam massive.   That option sounds good... allow people to pay for The Sun at a nominal price first, then provide the articles for free on the website later...    ooh you could get a IPad and Galaxy Tab APP! yeah, I'm willing to let you to use http://bitcoinservice.co.uk/ free of commission, (I'll pay you back the fees), if you let me have an advert in the sun. Updated, exciting new project available: check above! Bitcoin MelbourneAs part of the #bitcoin-aus gang.  I have decided to create the Melbourne Bitcoin Group on Face-book and elsewhere: https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_205111516197274Join the group!  We are in-planing to have a meet-up. Just wanted to start this thread as a way to group together all the different location based bitcoin groups, with some handy links.Check out: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/IRC_channels  for IRC info.Make a post about your group, and I'll add a link to the the post.BrazilIRC: #bitcoin-brCanadiaIRC: #bitcoin-cadGermanyIRC: #bitcoin-deDenmarkIRC: #bitcoin-dkFranceIRC: #bitcoin-frAustraliaWebsite: http://bitcoin.com.au/IRC: #bitcoin-ausBitcoin Melbourne: https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_205111516197274(mod, can you please sticky this thread) people who mine at a loss are not helping the bitcoin community optimally.  You would more optimaly help the community from taking the money you would have spent on electricity and putting that into buying bitcoins.  You will help the bitcoin community more, and gain more many more bitoins in total for yourself. Gpu's are good because they can be used to do computational work on other problems to bitcoin...The real question is why don't we make a co-op and build bitcoin asic's?  Then sell them for profit... this means that we get GBP or other asset, while still helping the bitcoin community. Well bitcoin is unquestionable, it is defined by maths.   Anyone is free to change it.  However that change will make it into something new; it won't be bitcoin any more.However, I suspect, the first change that will be increasing the block size.  As that is only enforced by the miners. you can sell your digital products through my site: bitcoinservice.co.uk House prices would be much much lower because they are not going to be based on the price of 'funny money' that is printed out of thin air (Unbaked Fiat Money). I would think that this community is one of the least sexist that I have every been in... I guess we put a much higher weight on competency than gender.  Also being pseudo anonymous means that there isn't any real barriers for either gender to participate.For me, I try my best to judge people by what is important (are they good people for the job they are doing).  However, I hold the right for people to be stupid, and judge people for stupid reasons, like gender.On the chick gamers view:  maybe a site that sells SIMS clothes and other cool gear would be attractive to such a demographic.   Plato,  I like this one... I think that it is the most believable so far. reminds me of: https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=1909.0 Somebody should really make a very expensive on-line shoe store that sell designer shoes and handbags exclusivity for bitcoin.  (many, many bitcoins).   good. there is no patriarchy within the bitcoin community... why the dominance of men... could it be that men are, in general, interested in different things to women? and not a scam. 12.500.000 bitcoins did not exist back then, lol they don't even exist now.That is to-many bits to brute-force crack,  also memorising a full private key is unbelievable.You cannot contact people through their bitcoin address.Overall good effort, however not particularly believable.  We certainly can do better than that!The best one I've seen so far has been by bitlottoEdit: how many bits would be considered too hard? Of course you are allowed to plagiarize... the question is "are people going to vote for me if I plagiarize?"
In response to lastminer's poorly written scams, I am holding a competition for the making the best bitcoin Nigerian email style scam!The winner will be the most creative, believable, and well written.Include your Bitcoin address in the post for tips.This thread will be closed in 1 week and a new thread will be created to vote on the winner.Have fun!   bitcoin2cash... what is your updated rate? I'm really sorry... I would have put a catch all phrase in earlier, however I had forgotten about it.However 200 BTC is like 10x the market price for such a site.If I wanted to get it done I could 'pay' almost any of the web-developers for hire 20 BTC and get it done... and own the result.I don't' think anyone can claim that I don't put lots of money into community projects.However I just cannot afford the opportunity cost of paying out this pledge. (the full 200 BTC) Bitcoin doesn't need to be user friendly in the short term: remember how many people used torrents before Azureus was stable.Sometimes it is good to have a geeky edge.  What is important is making sure our systems are much more secure than our competition. +1XBC = 100 SatoshisI like  afterburner229 is a troll...Gotta' troll the obvious troll.   See we have got down to the basic difference between those who are 'left' and those who are 'right' (Fuck I hate those terms):Do people have positive 'rights?'Well as a voluntarist, I believe people are only compelled 'not to do something.'  E.g. I can not push you into the pool, but I have no requirement to save you from drowning.  (however if I bumped you in, I would be required to save you).Violence is when you threaten somebody else's freedoms.  Aka:  "I will put you in jail if you don't trade with me."  or "I will kill you if you don't give me your house."All you can claim is that I don't 'directly infringe' on your freedoms.  If you claim anything more, you MUST also claim some form of ownership over me.So for anyone who claims a positive right, they are claiming that they ever directly (themselves) or indirectly (society as a whole) own other people. holy shit! 200 BTC is lots of money now...  will restructure this prize! @VandroiyThere have been many people that have passionately said that 'Bitcoin was wrong back in early 2010, and they said that it would never get even close to where it is now.The free market is much more flexible than what you describe.  Did you know that in a free market dominated by Bitcoin, that 'everyone' would be advantaged by its stability?  So the risk to attack may be very very small.  Therefore making Bitcoin more inefficient by artificially shifting more resources into mining may make Bitcoin even less secure as people will not use Bitcoin but something that is cheaper.The fact is that 'we don't know' what is going to happen... We just know that bitcoin so far has been very successful, and that throughout history a free market has been very successful at predicting and working around any 'attack issues.'Artificial restrictions are stupid and should be avoided.  I disagree that there should be a fixed fee schedule and block size... I think that it would be more accurately described by competition between the miners.  At some point, Bitcoin may be so cheap and fast, and require such a large amount of infrastructure to run that the people running the network would have a strong stake in keeping it secure.Vandroiy, you ignore 'idle resources;' good people may have huge computational resources just sitting there for use as a deterrent to any attacker... Those resources could be sponsored by each the big bitcoin banks.  An attack will never happen, because it would be prohibitively expensive to undertake... not from the active network power, but from the potential.In any case, there is so much about the future that we don't know... and this is all speculation.We should focus on making Bitcoin as secure as possible NOW, not 50 years in the future. Have no rules and let the miners decide.  Let the Bitcoin clients check how many transactions are 'in waiting' and what fees they have.Provide a dialogue that asks the user to specify a fee, calculating the 'expected time till inclusion in a block.'This dialogue should include a 'suggested' button that autos to the minimum expected fee needed to get a confirmation within an hour.A warning should be displayed if the fee is too low and the expected time for inclusion is more than 100 blocks.  However, the user can still take a gamble and send the transaction.The best option is to provide the miners choice of what fees they want to have, and to provide the end-users the option to select the minimum fee they need for their uses.  (some people don't care if the transaction takes a day, but want to minimise their fees). Do not use USB keys for long term data storage... The Data has a half-life of around 6years.Use a mechanical Hard drive...Or store your Bitcoins in PGP encrypted files that you send to all your friends + and other places...Print our your private key on acid free paper and password (or keep pass in head). Store the printout in a double scaled bag in a waterproof box marine box.That is one option. Hiding assets is hard... e.g. a house, or a car.They don't mind you hiding cash, because of inflation they make it worthless over time anyway.Bitcoin is good, because it holds it's value.  So you can hide real 'wealth' instead of play-money.  Gavin, what do you think about including a second root-hash in the block hash tree.  This hash is the merkle root of a tree containing the root hashes every block before it?This will be a useful feature for thin clients; once the clients have downloaded all the root hashes of the previous blocks, any new block can be used to check if the downloaded root hashes are correct.This will enable secure arbitrary block download.It is a miner modification to a block... I don't see it containing a large overhead,  it involves a extra sha256 of 3.2 MB / 100,000 blocks. It adds ~256bit to the block size.  I think that it's benefits out weigh the costs. Well either the owner of the old transactions keeps the old blocks himself, or he pays another company to keep the old block for him.The owner of the old coins understands that his old coins will be un-spendable if the old blocks are completely forgotten.This is a user-pays system.  That is a good thing. Instead of stopping the address collisions, we should focus on *every other doomsday scenario* because they are all way more likely. You can safely prune both spent and unspent transactions, in fact you can prune entire blocks with spent transactions (for everyone except those those who own the coins in the given old blocks).Each miner keeps a list the root hashes of all the previous block, from the genesis block. (e.g. 256bit per block)A hash of all the past hashes is included in every block. (a slight modification to the block chain, but trivial) e.g. a Merkle hash tree rootWhen an old transaction is announced, the miner downloads the block that contains these old coins.The miner compares the hash of the block downloaded to the known good hash of the blockThe miner then can check if the transaction is valid or not.When a block is announced with containing a very old block, the network will re-download that block and check if the transaction is correct(most) of the network forgets the old block once the new block is verifiedSee with one small change to the block-chain, (to contain a 2nd root of the hashes of all the past blocks), you can have secure on-demand downloading of old blocks.So I believe your premise is incorrect. This is not correct.  The cost is nothing more than what would need to be kept anyway even with culling. Please see: Merkle hash treesThe person who owns the old coins needs to maintain a archive of the blocks that contain those coins... Again moving to a 'user-pay' system.  When the owner of the old coins wants to spend the coins that owner must provide a copy of the full old block.The owner makes a transaction and provides the old block for download.  (if the miners who offer this service don't already choose to keep the old blocks)There is no global cost, (aka a user-pays system), then there is no 'unintended consequence' - the few miners who wants to secure old blocks (by downloading old blocks or keeping a archive), can charge a premium for the service.  This is why it is a 'transaction fee' for 'processing the transaction.'  If it requites more work to process old transaction, then those transactions will attract higher fees.  (again a user-pays system).Again, yes there is, See: Merkle hash trees: negligible cost for verifying old blocks without long-term storage.  (other than the owner of the coins providing the block for upload)This, again, is incorrect.  Nobody is compelling any miner to process old transaction... The miners can choose to reject old transactions for whatever reason they want.  Including their age. This whole thread is based upon a false premise: there is a global storage cost for old transactions.  This is untrue.The miners only need to keep the root hash of every block to verify transactions.  However the owner of the old coins needs to keep an complete copy of the old block.To spend the old coins. The owner announces both the transaction, and provides the old coin's block for upload.  The miners (who wish to) will see this transaction an 're-download' the old block. (and compare the root Merkle hashes)The miner only need to keep the more recent blocks, old blocks can be downloaded when needed.  Only some of the miners will bother to download the old block, others will just focus on bitcoins in recent blocks.This extra work of checking old blocks can adequately and naturally attract higher transaction fees. (but not demurrage, as there was no 'storage costs')The whole concept of demurrage doesn't isn't economically logical.  Just like always issuing new coins always isn't economically logical.  The COST involved isn't to secure old coins - but to secure NEW TRANSACTIONS.  When all the Bitcoin's are mined, securing transactions moves to a user-pays model.  (as it should be, the user pays for the cost)There is no cost in 'not using' Bitcoin. People trust Bitcoin because it is secure, not because they are mining it themselves. people will stop mining when it gets unprofitable.  This will reduce the ratio of miners / non-miners.  Making the economy stable again.Edit: you are also forgetting about technology advances that improve mining.  They increase the difficulty _while_ reducing the total number of people mining.  (That was seen when many people dropped out when CPU mining became unprofitable).

Deflation is very destabilising on a system that can only function, by design, with inflation.  That system is debt based money.If you generalize that to every money you have made a big mistake... Just because something is bad for one thing, doesn't make it bad for everything.Deflation is bad when 'every' bit of money needs to be repaid.  Therefore you have a fixed monetary cost (the repayment of the debt), and a increasing real cost. Any money that isn't debt based is immune to the so-called 'problems' of deflation, because as the buying power of the monetary unit increase, everyone who owns the money becomes richer and gains purchasing power, (even if the money is on loan, the person who has claim to the loan has more value).  This means that people who have money are 'encouraged' to spend it, rather than save it for the debt repayments.Take it from another prospective. In a society that uses debt based money, (aka fiat money), the entire society is in debt to the reserve bank.  If the buying power of the money increased from shortage, the society still needs to pay back it's debt.  Thus reducing the available money supply again.  It is a viscous circle.It is like holding all the food of the town on ransom, and issuing 100 credits for all of it.  If only one credit gets lost, somebody is going to have to starve, and the 99th credit is going have virtually unlimited value.  But It is worse than that, if somebody  somehow trade to get two credits (eg. a saver), they are holding the food for the last person at ransom and can set any price.Debit based money is inherently evil, once you understand what it dose... It is a way for setting people against each other economically.Deflation is good if you have good money.  Inflation is the lesser of two evils if you have evil money to start with. here is a diagram of what I was thinking of: Ok just take advantage of _my_ hosting... that happens not to be free... (for me at least)  Anyway, we are in the process of designing the next version of the bitcoinservice.co.ukThis new version will not be backwards compilable with any pre-existing uploads, as we are changing the url format.Just a head's up... maybe I'll put an advert in The Bitcoin Sun to announce the changes. Everyone following please comment on the possible Bitcoin Transport Layer API, that the BtcFn project plans to make use of.Link here: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=8379.0 More info on BtcFn can be found here: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7181.0 The BtcFn (The Bitcoin Freenet Project) project is in the process of working on the API connecting to the bitcoin client to other transport layers / data back-ends.These backed layers will be used to transmit various bitcoin data over different protocols,  such possible uses could be:Program that saves and reads a copy of the block-chain from a file.  Say used to save the block-chain on a USB key-drive.A radio station could transmit the block-chain over short-wave radio so that everyone in the world has access to it.  The same API could be used for a program to automatically import the block-chain updates in the Bitcoin software.BtcTorrent, a simple application that takes advantage of the API and lib-torrent that allows new clients to quickly download the block chain.The above mentioned bitcoin on freenet project, this project will allow clients to use bitcoin with freenet as a transport layer, for both transmission of the block chain, and transactions.Traditional bitcoin transport layer application.  This application will implement the standard bitcoin p2p protocol, and will be used by default.The API should be designed so that multiple applications can connect to the same bitcoin instance at the same time.   The API should be non-blocking and atomic in design... (either something works completely, or it fails completely).  Finally the API should have no access to any function that interacts with the wallet.The goal is that every bitcoin implementation will implement this API, so any bitcoin implementation can use any transport implementation.  e.g. Bitcoinj could make use of the same Bitcoin p2p application as the mainline client.Questions/Comments?We will be working on the design on the bitcoin wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Transport_Layer_API http://agoristradio.com/?p=347We talk about the possible 'licensed generator' attack on the bitcoin infrastructure.  Restricting the block chain to generators who have gained a government sponsored licence... This way the government could dictate rules about what transactions can be included in the chain, and what should be rejected.  We then go on to talk about how such an attack is very hard to pull of and would take a huge amount of resources.The second part of the show we talk about other attacks on bitcoin and brig up the BtcFn project:https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=7181.0We talk about Freenet and a possible sneakernet based upon it.Overall I had a great time, and was very please to promote Bitcoin and Freenet! The core members of the Bitcoin community will buy low and sell high... so they will build up a disproportionally large amount of the total ownership. We should really donate more to S3052, even a couple of Bitcoin helps heaps...I know I have. Ummm... Didn't God send us Satoshi?  or Haven't you been reading you BitBible before bed again? I am interested in purchasing these cards... Can I Buy a few of them, 'unloaded,' once I have confirmed that they have arrived safely and are untamed with. You send the coins to the addresses contained?(Shipping to Aus) I believe they are voting shares, you buy them if you want a say in how the company will operate.I assume they will be worth something if a large 3rd party company wants to buyout a majority of the control.I guess there are people who buy the A Class shares will also want to buy some B Class shares so they can get more say in how the company operates? Cool, I just gave you a -1   We don't' know what will happen without a proper game theory analysis of the system... You never know, Satoshi may have been a game theory expert and knows that the miners can set their own max block size and the system will still maintain a reasonable security.Until we (or somebody) puts the effort in for a formal game theory analysis, we will not know, and this is pointless speculation. A Bitcoin transaction is nothing more than a expression of your view of who should be the new owner of your coins.
If they start attacking the system we will just DDOS them! People hoard when they have a foreseen cost (or an unforeseen fixed cost) in the future.  This is the same as an economy, the economy hoards when there is a cost in the future that needs to be paid for.If you had a loan, and had to make $10 repayments every day, and the value of the dollar was going up... you would hoard dollars for your repayments.  (your repayments don't change if $10 can buy a hat or a car)If people traded Bitcoin or Gold, they are NOT in debt, so they have no 'fixed repayments' to make in the future.  When they hold large am mounts of Gold or Bitcoin we call that saving or investment.When the value of Bitcoin or Gold go up, people are FREE TO SPEND IT because they do not need to REPAY IT.  This gives 'negative feedback' so the deflationary spiral doesn't accelerate, but it slows down.Then the ENTIRE SOCIETY needs to repay MORE than the FLOATING MONETARY SUPPLY is when you see the Deflationary Spiral accelerate.  There isn't enough money to go around (as most of the money is locked up in investments), to repay the outstanding debt.Those who have savings are holding those who are in DEBT to ransom for the repayments of their loans.  Becasue fiat money is debt.  Every bit needs to be repaid!  The only way to repay debt is to take out new debt.  Not until new debt has been taken on, or every person has sold all their holdings of money can the debt be repaid....Fiat Debt based money are Oranges, and Gold and Silver are Apples. The deflationary spiral is a real problem for fiat, debt based money.  Becasue of the fixed future cost (repayment of the capital of the loan) v.s. the contracting monetary supply.Bitcoin (and Gold, Silver, etc) are not effected by the deflationary spiral, as they are not debt.See: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deflationary_spiral  xf2.orgKeep up the good work!  I am most happy with your service!   We have hired Xelister and his team to do the initial development for 800 BTC...If we get any more BTC, we can hire his team for a longer time.

It looks like since the bounty is worth $300 USD, we may get some good entries.When we have a good selection of videos (say 6 or 7 videos), I'll put up the poll and we can all vote! +1  It was reputation suicide. So it is important that Bitcoin doesn't break $3, $1.6.  That is a very large range.  So now we should see resistance at the upper line of the price channel? This bounty consists the making of a peer-reviewed paper on the possible outcomes from the current Fee Schedule for Bitcoin.This paper needs to take into account that miners may choose to make the blocks larger vs. the risk of getting rejected.Pledges:da2ce7: 10 BTC I would never sell all my Bitcoin in speculation...  Keep up the great work! Donated 5btc One quick question, when do we know if it has clearly broken out of the price channel?  If we keep in this price channel the market really cannot move to $5 till July... Yes, that is because an 'investment' in the economy money is the same as an 'General Investment' in the entire economy.  Think of it as a weighted basket investment in every venture in the entire economy... That is what money is.When somebody 'makes' money, they are getting this investment for no-cost (theft, or predetermined inflation).  When the money supply is fixed, that means that the only way to get such an 'investment' in the economy is to buy if from somebody in the economy.The 'wealth redistribution' is a fury then also.  As the only reason that a 'money holder' is getting more wealthy, is because the entire economy is getting more wealthy. (if there is no monetary inflation).  The only way that this 'money holder' can get money, is to trade it for goods and services. (being part of the economy)

There is nothing wrong about keeping a secret until you are ready.  Often if things are made public too early, then everyone gets a bad impression and are hard to convince once it is ready to use. Both ends of the business are effected by price deflation/inflation.  All other things equal, the business should maintain the same profit margins.  (Income and Costs decrease at the same rate)With price inflation, that means that either the economy is getting smaller. Or there is a redistribution of wealth...  Both of those make otherwise profitable business unprofitable.With price deflation, that means that the economy is growing. (Or people are saving for future hard times).  Either the business must be unprofitable and is made redundant by competition. Or is deemed 'not important' by the community v.s. saving for the future. The only browser that is stable with MTGox is Firefox. They need to accept Bitcoin donations! If I was a miner, I would be planing to make my own rules... The question is if the other miners will accept my blocks or not.  It comes down to at some point the miners adjusting their rules for maximum profit, while not getting rejected by the rest of the network.What we need is a proper game theory analysis of Bitcoin fees, the rules that miners can set, and the risk of getting your block rejected.If Bitcoin becomes the dominant monetary system, then very very low fees might still be very safe.  We just don't know yet.Edit:I put 10 BTC down for a game theory analysis of the Bitcoin fee system as it stands v.s. a system where there is no 'fixed' block limit.  Only what the other miners choose to accept.  Must be peer reviewed. I wouldn't want to own another persons soul, even if somebody paid me for it. The cartel will naturally charge as much as the market can withstand: If there is a serious thread from double spending then the market will accept higher fees.  If there isn't much of a threat to double spending, then the transaction cost will and should go down to virtually zero. This has already been talked about here: https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1847.0To summarise, the miners will from some sort of self-regulating cartel to make sure that the fees don't go to 0.  The cartel will reject block that have too many 'free/low-fee' transactions in it.The will set their own rules like:  A transaction that has a fee less than 0.0001 BTC must wait at least 4 blocks before being accepted.If the cartel becomes too profitable, some members will leave it and accept transactions under their own rules.Overall, it should work out that the system naturally balances to the security required by the network. When my projects are made public, I'll pay you (or one of your writers) to write a well-researched article on my projects.  You could (should) make profit of this. This poll is much harder.  I'm bookmarking $20 for January next year. Bitcoin will be taken up by the markets that get the most benefit from it.  Markets that have high overheads using fiat money will have a much larger impulse to move to Bitcoin than those that operate relativity freely.Money Laundering, Drug Trade, Assassinations, Tax Avoidance, Internet Payments. All have a high overhead, these will be types of things that move to Bitcoin with the most vigour.  Naturally.Correct, the reason that Bitcoin will be used by these things  is because there is a market for it.  Without prohibition (except Assassination), the market doesn't need to be opaque.Without prohibition, there wouldn't be much of a primed market for Bitcoin, It would be much harder to have made it popular.In many ways the Cat is out of the bag; the horse has bolted.Welcome to the wild west, didn't the 'wild west' get it's name from being Wild? 2 BTC sent!   Either Bitcoin Reaches $10 this year, or it never dose.   There is lots of confusion about this topic from Keynesian 'economists.'The deflationary spiral is a real condition that affects the fiat reserve back system.First you need to understand that there is no money as an asset, but a whole lot of IOUs that we are trading.  When the money supply is contracting (deflation) that means people are paying back their loans. (or saving).The other thing is to understand is there is MORE loans out there than money, so when people pay back their loans, the money to pay back the reaming loans becomes harder to find.When the economy is booming or growing, more and more people take out loans to fund their future endeavours, thus increasing the monetary supply.  Because the economy is growing, this masks the real inflation (of the monetary supply).The deflationary spiral happens when people start saving because of a slowing or contracting economy.  The money supply gets smaller as the loans get paid back, but because there is more loans that money, the total liquid money supply quickly gets smaller.  Remember hording means the repayment of loans, meaning money is being destroyed.  The loans get harder and harder to repay, and people start defaulting.Thus in the current economic system, dollars will become very expensive stoping people spending, slowing the economy. Not because they are saving (for future spending), but because they are paying back their loans (so they don't have to pay interest).Bitcoins are different.  Bitcoins go up in value when the bitcoin economy grows, and go down in value when it contracts.  Everything is the opposite to the fiat fractional reserve banking system.Bitcoins ONLY deflate in value when the Bitcoin Economy is GROWING. Wow, thanks for the offer. Will add it to the list!Thanks  Will add it to the list!Thanks  Will add it to the list!  Don't know about driving in Europe, could be fun tho!

(Without the use of software) Use Adobe Premiere Pro CS5, it is great! Hex Encoding:Base Units: 1BTC = 5F5E100Human Units: 0.00000001BTC = 1 / 5F5E100Decimal Encoding:Base Units:  1BTC = 100000000Human Units: 0.00000001BTC = 0.00000001Comments? +1 common guys, you know how to summarise quotes better than that! Bitcoin is weird to them, as it is a 'money' that is 'worth something' and doesn't require 'force' to use. No problem with that, by November hopefully 100 BTC will be worth quite large amount of money.  no, just lazy checking by me:  I searched for James with a 's', not 'z.'  sorry. This bounty shouldn't be too hard, once bitcoinj has been developed, porting over to C# shouldn't be toohard.  Then a WPF GUI needs to be made, and some sort of way to download/send transactions over http needs to be developed.

I am looking for a dedicated service.  Needs Good Bandwidth and reliable.Will pay Bitcoin.  Any offers? There is no 'aggression' in copying, as it is independent of the primary party (the author).  No interaction between the 'author' and the 'copier' needs to occur.  If no interaction, no violence can have taken place. IP can more easily be debunked from this prospective:An non-violent act (copying information), needs a violent act (the enforcement of IP rights) to be stopped. Now that is plain arrogant!Economics is rational and common scene. What you are saying is that unless people have worked out the right 'words' they stupid.I like laissez-faire capitalism, not because I have read up extensively on the subject.  But because it is EASY to understand.  Economics isn't hard, it is just applying rational logic to real life.It is the people who make economics into a super complex science who have got us into all this mess.On a rational view, inflation is theft, leading to mal-investment. However once it has been covered up with 100 layers of complexity the logical fallacy (inflation is good) can more easily be hidden. Look, If I asked my friends to read Economics in One Lesson, they would go 'what do you think I am? somebody with spare time?'A short essay around 10 pages long is the most that anyone has time for.  It needs to have graphs and diagrams to explain some of the more complex features, not just large blocks of text.
'It's brief' my ass The problem with this system is that the miners get as many domains as they want for free.  We need to use transaction scripts with a 3rd party escrow that releases the funds slowly.  This will create a 'reputation' based system, where escrows that are respected can charge greater fees/have a more respected 'domain chain'. People should be paying for the upkeep of the network, not the domains themselves.  I think that a 'hosting fee' or taking money through registration and updating records would be the best manner.  Just like we have transaction fees on the Bitcoin network for the long-term 'upkeep.'If a spammer makes 1000000 domains, the spammer must pay for the upkeep of 1000000 domains, this will be very expensive.  The domains themselves are unlimited (there are an unlimited number of possible strings), so in-themselves they shouldn't have a price.Think: are you charged for creating a Bitcoin address? No!  You are charged for USING your bitcoin address. True,  the BitDNS must have some sort of load balancing, so that domains remain cheap, but are not spammed.I would like domains to be like Bitcoin address, You can make as many as you like, but only ones that have coins on them are worth anything. Britcoin is good until you try using it.  It is SO much easer to use mtgox than Britcoin.Maybe that is just the lack of features, but the general interface (being stuck in the corner of the screen) is annoying to use.I say take a hint from mtgox:P I like that program   I put 5BTC towards it. So-called 'frozen coins' will attract a higher transaction free.  Those higher fees will create additional demand for blind miners...  Coins will never be frozen unless the majority of the hashing power forces decide to reject block that contain them.We will see a chain split at that point. Probably moving to a different algorithm that is hard for asic's to compute.  This 'alt' chain will contain all the transactions indistinctly if they are from good coins or not. On Feenode, join #bitcoin-aus    talk about all the cool things happening locallyCam. No, you cannot have a competition with only one video! Yep, Key length is useful to be short, because many people might want to keep a printout of their private key in their fire safe.So they can backup from anywhere know the only copy of the key is in a secure location. Public-private key cryptography allows Bitcoin to generate new address without requesting the passphase.It is also useful in for 'backups' when the backup op doesn't have access to the private keys.  This is useful if there is multiple wallets. Because people are lazy and might be confused, remember thinking for oneself is a bad thing. While the market is moving wildly like that, there will be lots of profit to be made by speculators, the more profit taken by the speculators, the more liquid the markets, the better for the Bitcoin economy.The wild swings in the bitcoin market is the natural way to attract speculators.   You don't swear on a tool, you swear on an ideology.

Corrected. Hey, check out: https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=5772.0Could help you out with your project.   Yep.  Without a some sort of 'money' to convey 'value information' there will be no effective way to calculate the 'opportunity cost' of any action or inaction.Money is the 'collective mind,' that the RBE talk about.  A free money takes into account the collective individuals' 'value' that the economy places on 'anything.'Things that benefit society (bring in more useful resources) will be 'profitable,'  things that destroy useful resources will be 'unprofitable.'There is only one moral code that people need to accept:  'only enter into voluntary relationship with other people.'  and the right for one to use 'self defence to stop cohesive violent force.'Then people will be free to choose whatever society they want to live in.  Of course some will choose to live in 'Zeitgeist' communities, others will choose not to. All astrology, I'm quite good at it actually.   Just a bit of fundamental prospective, The Bitcoin economy size was much smaller when we hit the $1.1 peak.  At that time the amount of good and services offered by the economy, by my estimation supported around a 10c price. So there was a 10x speculation.As S3052 said, when the market was a 1.1, it could continue going up to 1.5, 1.7 and higher, or there could be a break, there was break.The $1.1 peak showed that the investors expected the Bitcoin economy to grow 10x as large, in the medium investment term.Since the $1.1 peak, (that shows how large the economy is expected to grow in the medium term), we market has been consolidating on the expected short-term market size.  This seems to be around 70-80c,  by seeing that it has not breached the 50c the real size of the economy growth has been 'better than expected.'When the goods and services market size is larger than a size that is required to support 50c, we will then see out next rally to the previous target size of $1.1 (as the market is now convinced that we will achieve the medium term goal).  We will likely see that it will rally much higher as new medium term goals are set. ($5, $10, $50, etc)The key question is:  What price would the goods and services market support now?My answer is: at least 20c, maybe near 50c...   We are qualitatively at least twice as large as when we hit $1.1We are on track, as the market hasn't broken 50c price yet. If apple trees were a pest and destroying your solar array, then no.See, everything in life is relative. Even in physics there is nothing 'intrinsic' (that we know of)... everything has to be measured by it's relationship to something else. I think that it is so old that it doesn't even make it on the list...https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparisonthe nforce2 was good for it's time... I remember having one a long time ago.https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/NForce2:OEdit: whoops, the nforce2 was a chipset not a GPU.  It has NO processing power  (got mixed up with the GeForce2)   we need a Bitcoin xtube clone, where the viewers can donate to the makers of the videos that they like...    I think that would work really well, and would be natural for bitcoin. The price should be calculated using a different formula:0.1B*MB(file size) + 0.01Flag-fall + Asking PriceThe cost of hosting an item is related to the files size, not the asking price. Sounds logical and rational upon first read.I agree that the choice of coins should be geared towards making outputs of close to equal size (some more going to the 3rd party, some less going to the 3rd party).

    Has anyone used http://www.xe.com/fx/?Good or Bad experiences?  Would anyone recommend? One solution would be to trade with family (or other trusted parties) in other countries.Trusted traders well maintain accounts with their partners in other countries,  going in debt or credit with each other.Only once they have become significantly unbalanced will the traders settle their accounts.Settling the accounts could involve sending the funds to a relative of the trader in each country, or any other way that minimises international money transfers.  We need an international backbone of trusted Bitcoin traders to feed the in-person OTC trades, otherwise the OTC trader quickly has all BTC or local currency.We need to start thinking of creative solutions.   Over the last two months I have been intently observing the growth of the Bitcoin economy.  The interest in Bitcoin has been astounding, well at least until the interested party tries to buy some.Buying Bitcoin's is an mission and a half.  Either the particular solution for the trader is non-obvious or requires a huge amount of effort.As a community we need to do better if we seriously want Bitcoin to succeed!Some of my idea's to help:Write a 'Trading Guide' explaining the best practices for trading BitcoinMake Bitcoin-OTC easier to useModerate the marketplace forum more strictly, enforce well formed titles and stylesDevelop a backbone of international Bitcoin tradersPlease post your ideas, and talk about what you can personalty do to help make Bitcoin liquid.

Good Idea, however, everyone is talking over eachother...  and low quality, somebody's mic is clipping.  now that is just stupid...even if you had 99.99% of the mining power, and bought almost all the coins available.  It will be until about 2020 till the coins have been generated. I guess the problem is that it isn't a very good game  When connecting to a normal server, I get: SSL error: ssl not availableEdit: Ok, Normal SSL works, I just didn't have openssl installed.   Freenode irc seems to not working, either connecting by SSL directly or via Onion.  Anyone else having troubles? I have been placing some thought and effort into this topic also.The BtcFn (Bitcoin on Freenet) project was my first effort to allow Bitcoin to be run on a darknet.  https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2312.0Freenet is designed to be a scalable darknet.   Overall social networking is how anything is ever done. However face to face communication is the most effective, as it is best to trust your real life friends. Or maybe we can just grow up and make choices for ourselves? In the bitcoin community there isn't any official or unofficial anything. Think 'like anonymous' http://vodo.net/zenithJust watched Part One. ey' What do the other bitcoiners think? I learnt about it in the first Slashdot post.  Took me about 2 weeks to work out why Bitcoin was important.  Since I have worked it out.  Have been excited ever since. Depends if you spend the Bitcoin's or not.  If you don't spend the coins, you are forcing the bank to donate to the Bitcoin community.  The question comes down to if it is a moral thing to do or not. All Good have my BTC now  so since I have deposited my 50 BTC into britcoin.... it didn't just eat it... but needs to wait for your approval?http://blockexplorer.com/address/1Co7JfbDdWftXHYPejeouooRQtZWocDSB7 it is hard to be bright in a dark world. sorry larry, I have no idea what you are offering. grondilu, I half agree with you.What Nefario has done is very good for the students!  They are learning much about how to interact with western people, this is good for them!They have been learnt remarkably fast.  I think that Nefario has helped them more than any other tests would have.However I do think that the Chinese students could learn even more if they decided to become active members in all the forum, learning how bitcoin works and why we feel that it is important would be great for their global understanding. You forgot your mum! I don't think that I should be a mod   I'm a bit to @.@ crazy for that sort of responsibility. But there are limited resources, people like cars, computers, hookers.  If you have to share everything what dose one have?  Nothing?If you are the only one with water, do you have to share it with everyone so everyone dehydrates?In a 'nobody owning anything' society, there is no impulse for anyone to save up for the bad times.  As everyone else will attack you for 'hoarding.'To me any non-capitalistic society will be short-lived.  Particularly one that runs on anarchy.Economically it is unsustainable, morally it is evil. So what do they like?
updated: positions fulfilled.  Will update when new positions become available.  Always still looking for volunteer work. There should be two layers of encryption.The entire wallet should have (optional) AES encryption.Nested inside this wallet package there should be a PGP private and public key.  This private key should be also encrypted with AES (but with a different passphase)Every Bitcoin private key should be encrypted independently to the public key, so making a new Bitcoin address will not require entering the private key passphase.When first loading, Bitcoin will ask for the AES wallet key, if there is one. (this step is optional)Once the wallet is decrypted, the client will ask "How much funds do you want to make available for spending, and for how long?"If the answer is more than 'none,'  the client will ask for the private key passphase, and decrypt the minimum number of bitcoin private keys required to make the funds available and store them only in memory.  The passphase and decrypted global private key will automatically be deleted (from memory) after this operation.If the user wishes to unlock more funds, or wants to send funds after the unlocked time has expired, the Bitcoin client will ask for the private key passphase again.

Sound like good business, on everyone's behalf other than the banks.   What a great idea I love 币  What would be better is to remove mining from the Bitcoin Client, and create a super user friendly mining software that automatically takes advantage of the CPU or GPU (if available).  Create a API so that this mining program so users can get statistics about the rate of Bitcoin being generated directly from their favourite pool. Assuming that SHA256 is uniform and well distributed.    That in for our needs it appears to be close enough to. No, but there are two rules.  You must not have acquired the property by force, and must be making use of it. Donated 25 BTC  Nope, it will just take longer... It is like looking in a pond for a lost coin... the longer that you spend drinking tea, the less time you are looking for the coin.   Of course, if you wait too long, the mud will go over the coin and make it harder to find. Meaning that the difficulty will go up, so it takes even longer to find  the lost coin.The key difference between the analogy above and what is really happening with Bitcoin is that the pond is the sea, and the coins are the sand.  There are lots of Gold grains evenly spread out in the sand, and you need only to find one Gold grain to win the 'block,' as the difficulty is increased, the size of the Gold grain that you need to find gets larger, so it take more tries. This is a hard project, that will require both technical skill and help from other forum members...The goal is for a simple Chinese TOR website that explains how to set-up and use Bitcoin-OTCTotal payment is 60 BTC. including payment for the hosting of the server.  etc.Must be both easy to understand and be non-technically threatening.  Must also take into account (or work around) the legal and social requirements in China.I hope that this project isn't too hard.Overall it involves:Obtaining and setting up TOR.Using Mybitcoin.com as a wallet.Creating a GMX or GMAIL user account on TORSetting Up GPG, creating a new Identity.Installing and Setting up Thunderbird with Enigmail, connected to a IMAP server.Registering nickname via PGP email for FreenodeSetting up XChat with SASL for FreenodeRegistering Public Key with #bitcoin-otcGuide to Bitcoin-OTC irc commandsThis project is not easy, it will require much collaboration and hard work.10 BTC bonus for a English translation.  Aggressive of course, you said that 'Capitalist A comes along' and was not 'making productive use.'Capitalist A had no right to claim 'ownership' over something that is not a product of his time and and effort. I don't' care what society people make, providing human interactions are voluntary.  Aggressive violence is evil.So my philosophy is: VoluntaryismI believe the best (and most moral, and natural) economic model that a free society can choose to use is laissez-faire capitalism.I'm happy for people to choose other ways of living their life, but I will choose to trade capital. Great!  There is no fees in integrating a bitcoin payment system other than the development time / costs.Check out the bitcoin wiki, much of the hard work has already been done.On the second point, I cannot directly answer that.  Bitcoin is still very young, and the economy is still small.  I guess the main incentive in using bitcoin is potential long-term competitive advantage it gives your site, if/when bitcoin indeed takes of.Hope that this help.  If you want to visit #bitcoin-dev on freenode.net irc, any technical questions are quickly answered.

This is a draft specification for a short bitcoin block and bitcoin address lookup system.This system will allow the reference of any of the addresses in the block chain with 100% accuracy.Format:2 xxxx YyyyPrefix: '2'This is to signify that it is NOT a bitcoin address, as bitcoin addresses start with a '1'xxxxBase 58 encoded block number.  such as 1112  (for Block #1) or 1zzz (for Block #195111).  4 characters should last us for at least 150years.Yyyythe start of the bitcoin address, until it is the only address that fits, with the '1' removed.for the bitcoin address: 12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX (picked randomly from the block explorer) it would be '2' as no other address in that particular block starts with '12'for example the address on block 1 will would have the code: 211122Address 1NA4tpWBG4RZGeTj9RjaUhDQd6QsrCz4Si  would be 21Zz8NThis would be much easier to quote over the phone or write or type by hand!Edit!  I hope I have the maths right now!

Try posting essays to your friends blogs like this:http://www.graemeklass.com/economics/a-competitor-to-the-reserve-bank-bitcoin/  It would be pretty cool if the client could sign a message with your payment, an the client could verity that signature.   Don't include the message in the block chain, just send it over whatever medium you normally communicate with. Atlas, you are too carefree, and don't properly check out peoples histories or give credit to people who have no reputation.  Even tho you have been fucked over, sometimes if you are not careful you open yourself to such attacks!Maybe providing tools for people to better check other traders histories so they don't get scammed, is a better, more productive solution than getting hot headed.Get scammed > work out what you missed > next time don't be as easy to scam.Bitcoin community shouldn't be a community that cries and gets upset when they get scammed.  It should be a community that is extremely hard to scam as all the traders are very careful.  providing you have smile for your next customer, then it is all good.  However I cannot help but think that your video reminds me of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmvkRoEowc  :OEdit: ok joke was a bit too harsh...  I need to back off on the black humour.
If you have old, and good quality drum and bass vinyl records. I am interested in buying bulk.  Name a price, I'm open to suggestion.  I am in Australia, so larger orders preferred.  Even people in the public service can do good things... However people who are not in the public service do good things also.  It isn't a question of good or bad, but forced or voluntary. keep your private keys secure in the same way that gpg dose.   I have the same case as you, a wicked case, one of the best ever made.   the updated version sucks tho.   You can be happy in a cage, if they treat you very well... but you will still be in cage... What part of 'lets-have-sex' doesn't have the implied possibility of having a child, everyone knows that condoms brake.However that isn't the point, with unintended consequences you just have to deal with it.  Life is full of uncertainty.  A better way of looking at this problem is did the people having sex voluntary do it or not.  Because if it was voluntary there is no issue.Finally, the woman voluntary decided to keep the child, and the farther voluntary decided to help care for it.  The mother could put the child up for adoption, or a host of other options.  I'm sure that if she didn't want it at all, there would be somebody else in the society wanting to look after it.Other than self-defense, there is always a voluntary option. Bitcoin is new, and growing fast.  Atm we are developing the tools to allow a proper economy.  Just a clarification, there are still only two types of actions, however in gray cases normally both parties have committed violent actions.  So it is hard to say one party is in the 'right.'The other type of gray actions are actions that use a debatable degree of force, such as making threats.  These ones need some court of court system to work out if it was violent or not.A free society is never going to be easy to achieve, and nobody really knows quite how it will work.  But it is a worthy goal to work towards. You are quite correct, the world is in shades of gray.I used the black and white example to polarise people on purpose as the thread was going in circles with detail.The case with MTGox is black and white, either people are forced with violence to use it, or not.   So my argument even when it is simplified to a black and white contrast, still holds strong.However, often the world doesn't provide such clear cut cases.  The often there is a need for careful weighing and the balancing of actions,  this sort of thing requires a court or adjudication system.  However how a court system would operate in a free society, has yet to be defined and has been the argument of philosophers for the ages now and past.  Somethings are never quite worked out, until they are done. I am glad that they have worked out a solution!  It seems like they are happily existing without violence, in that case it is moral, I am glad for them.The free market is based upon people having 'free interactions.'  A free interaction is not a interaction where you know everything, but rather an interaction that one choose to do on your own terms, (whatever they may be).If both parties to the interaction are in agreement, then it is good.  If the parties cannot agree on the terms, they walk away.imanikin prerogative is to control his (or her) own actions.   I guess it is a hard spot, declaring dark-pools as immoral yet unable to stop other people from trading (without the use of violence), I guess they only he  can do is shout louder.  However I'm not one to declare something a illegal just because I do not like doing it. The core fact is there are two types of interactions in this world:   voluntary   or    violentMorality also lies upon these two types of interactions also.  (Moral) consensual iterations  or   (In-moral) violently forced actionsThe big and small traders alike are not forced to use MTGox.  They both choose to use if out of their free will.imanikin is declaring that the traders (big or small) committed a 'in-moral' act by using MTGox, however has not presented any evidence of violence.Whatever happens on MTGox is moral! as long as there is no violent force to use MTGox.sidenote//(economically speaking dark pools are great!  They improve the efficiency of the market, making the trading price of Bitcoin many times more stable!  I am always amazed to see how stable the Bitcoin price is considering how low the trading volumes are). I wonder what the WingCash vs. Bitcoin exchange rate will be.   lol No problem, just use a pgp encrypted email.   No deleting of private keys, that is BAD!Don't remove it, just create a 'revoked' flag for the wallet, so it knows that address is compromised.   I like Grøstl it seems to be the best hash of the lot. Yep. However some coders are finding good work. But they are very good.I have been making some bounties to try and encourage some work, however they also have seen poor uptake.I think that we are in a 'everyone has a secret project' stage now, I think that this will last for a little while.   nothing to worry about, keep moving... you just forget that the price jumped from 25c to 100c in 3 months!  That is a market cap growth rate of over %2100 p.a. What happens is that real Bitcoin economy was slightly slower than it, and the price is lagging until the economy reaches that point again.The long-term prospect is that 1BTC is going to easily clear 10$ by mid September and $20 by November, and $30 by the end of the year!  lets see what happens, however I fully expect that soon new funds will come online.  The number of Bitcoin projects in development atm in this community is staggering.See there are stages, for example when he price was 25c the miners were sitting and waiting, now that the price has moved to around $1 the number of miners has dramatically increased.The stage before was when MTGox and other trading sites came online.We are in another phase now, this phase is when web-services based upon Bitcoin are being developed, when these come online, we will see a massive increase of trading value of Bitcoin.Then, again, the miners will fight over the leftovers.It will be a wild ride, it is the wild west after all. Get adding to: http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Bitcoin !!! The saying goes, you get what you pay for...    To me morality is very simple.  If you use violence, you are immoral (other than self-defense in the 1st and 2nd degree).
Another chart!  This one is posts per day, with a exponential y-axis.The moving average shows avg, posts per 31 days (month) / day. I'll put 100BTC @ 5 BTC per top 20 Players... so the Number 1 gets some bitcoin also.  I'm happy to promote something... just don't have anything to promote.

Here is my one: http://hosting11.imagecross.com/image-hosting-61/5032unicode1.png    Seriously, counseling services for BTC is a great idea!  Maybe even set it up so you can do face2face with skype.    noun: a semi-erect penis verb: to wobber, to be slapped in the face with a semi.    ROFL And we have an entry!     https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3517.0Thank you gavin! the shutting down of the bitcoin forum (in 6 or so months,) will probably be the best thing that ever happened to bitcoin.  Many, many times in history when a group is prosecuted, they decentralize and spread out.Providing we get the bitcoin foundation strong enough to survive an attack before then, the bitcoin community will emerge much, much, much stronger and hardened. How is one going to find these 'BitCoin merchants' if not from within the BitCoin community?  Having a so-called 'euro-trip' that happens to promote the bitcoin merchants in Europe is a great Idea IMHO!  Maybe not as wicked as freezing to death... but who know what crazy stuff one can get up to on a euro-trip and some good quality BTC! I was having a look at that, looks 'ok' project.  However a fully distributed system (such as freenet), involves lots of protocol issues that I'm wanting to avoid.  I'm trying to design a forum system that will work on the normal internet, TOR, or even on top of freenet.  However just getting it to work on the normal internet is a big enough challenge.A centralised system can be much faster than and distributed system, (avoids all the distribution issues).  In the long run, there isn't any real reason why the system I have designed cannot be placed on a distributed layer.  Just at this point I want to get it working in the first place.Read up on group certificates.   This system is the only system that allows you to use your real pgp for signing on the forum level, however the server has no idea who made the each post (other the poster is a valid member of the forum) and is resistant to spam and malicious users.   I'm in for 500 BTC or so...   Sounds like a good idea! I'm trying to do a few things at the same time:Forum that uses pgp signatures to verify the author's identityForum where the server can not understand the posts or know who it's users areForum where the server can easily be backed up and forkedForum where the server can check you are a member of the forum, without knowing who you are.The entire system hinges upon the group membership system.  Group membership allows the server to stop spam from non-resisted members, without needing to keep a list of public keys.  When a member misbehaves, the group membership opener can reveal who owns that membership, and expel that user.The server remains completely indifferent to the content or the members of the forum's it hosts.Protecting future posting for a period of time is a side effect of the system I'm intending to build.  It may be useful for small groups, however in larger groups it is largely irrelevant. (somebody is going to leak the key one way or another). The main reason of th the AES keys is only to keep the content hidden from the server.  For large forums it would be safe to assume that the key would be leaked very quickly.  However I image that there will be many forums, for small forums (say 10 members), it quite feasible that the ASE key will be kept secret for an extended period of time.The latest AES key will encrypt an archive of the previous key.  Having the latest key will gain one access to the entire history of post within that forum.  When the key is changed, only the new posts are no longer available.The server's role is to check that a member posting is doing what the 'forum owner' declares a member enrolled in that group can do.  For example, a member of a 'user' level group can add new content, however cannot remove other users posts.  A member of the 'moderators' group can remove 'users' posts. A member of a 'admin' group can do virtualy anything to the database.A plugin to Firefox would be the most natural way to implement this sort of forum, the client software should ask for a private pgp key, that key will be used generate all the other private keys used within the forum.  The server can contain an file that contains a encrypted archive of all the private information generated by each user's client.  This archive is used so that when the user clears her computer history (other than her private pgp key), she can still recover all her forum memberships. If i was in the mood of buying a car... looks nice... but not in the mood.  Welcome aboard! I'm looking for interest in developing the security and crypto model for a new breed of forum.  Using new security research into group signatures as forum membership. http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.68.816&rep=rep1&type=pdfSomething like this is how a post will work in the forum concept. (part of a larger picture)Comments are welcome. Message me on freenode.
lol  I suggest we move this thread to the "Technical Support" subforum.. In a free society, there will be only one form acceptable violence; violence in defense. (1st and 2nd degree only).  Otherwise once reputation is what is built or destroyed. There is nothing stopping a free society from having a court and arbitration process for conflicts.  Except the only time that one would be 'required (forced)' to attend is when one makes an act of aggressive violence.There are limited resources, that is what the free-market deals with.  The market will distribute the limited resources based upon who is going to give up the most 'good-will' aka money, for the good or service.I like to think that in a free society people will in general be much more generous than in a taxation society. Even if it is less generous, the lack of violence (eg Tax), is much more important than any service supplied by tax. I have already been doing the ground work for this...http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2361.0Make sure you get the 4chan guys not to link to bitcoin.org  but: http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Bitcoin   bullshit, Bitcoin mining is around 10 to 100 times too easy.    It is overly profitable atm!

One of my Goals is to get Bitcoin Working on Freenet https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2312.0Then one could download, install, and use bitcoin from a darknet.  my mirc keeps on forgetting it's sasl information...

I am looking for somebody, or a group of people to manage my bounties for me.  As I am now unable to commit to being reliable to fulfill them.  I will compensate 200BTC (and the Bitcoins to fulfill my bounties) to whoever takes upon the role.  If a new/low reputation user wants to take upon this roll, I will ask that a trusted person escrow the BTC.Comments/Questions?EDIT:Since Bitcoin is worth more... I'm not fulfilling any of my bounties if people have not checked that they are still active we me. Yep! Micro-payments are easy!  I have bitcoin, and pay people all the time in bitcoin.  It really is easy. We are really at a guess based market at the moment.     It will be very interesting to see where what we decide bitcoin is worth. (in the short term) Allow bitcoin to export wallet file with encryption.Question: Can we use the built-in Bitcoin public-private key infrastructure.  And use a Elliptic curve encryption?
