Nah. Skill, motivation and a skype account is sufficient. Looking for paid developers, check out http://identifi.org/ Just something I got stuck with, easy (?) 0.5 BTC for someone who's familiar with bitcoin-qt code: https://github.com/identifi/identifi/issues/3Now we just need to get that one fixed, plus some network code, and we have something that works.The current data storage and transfer model might not be the optimal, but this is more of a proof-of-concept implementation. Escrow requires trust in the arbitrator.Reputation is valuable in basically all human interaction. Airbnb, couchsurfing and Uber are practical examples of the power of reputation systems. The purpose is to crawl data from existing sources, so we don't need to build the WoT from scratch. The bitcoin-otc crawler is on GitHub  too.In Identifi, anyone can do identity verifications (i.e. make connections between identifiers) and choose whose verifications they trust. Anyone can start building a good reputation in identity verfication. A pseudonymous identity is just an identifier (a bitcoin address for example) that hasn't been reliably connected to the identifiers of an actual person.Most users will probably be using the network through a web service, but I'm planning to make it easier to be run locally. A browser plugin would be an interesting solution. Not completely functional yet, but still something to show: http://identi.fi (identifi/identifi). It's a Rails UI for the Identifi client, which is built on bitcoin-qt codebase. Basically, we flood trust packets throughout the network. Nodes give the priority to packets that are authored and signed by someone from within their web of trust.Feedback, technical suggestions and help with development is very welcome. The code is available on GitHub. I'm hoping to get a prototype out after this summer. This thread is also highly related: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47438 First National Innovation Brokers hired a Finnish law firm to demand removal of this thread.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=216717.0 My contact details in the bitcointalk.org whois record went public a couple weeks ago, as I moved the domain to my Finnish ISP. Last week I got a cease-and-desist letter from a Finnish law firm hired by the forex company First National Innovation Brokers (http://www.firstnationalib.com/). They demanded removal of this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=51820.0. They have no real legal case and I'm not even a forum / server admin of Bitcointalk anymore, so I'm not going to react to that.However, FNIB has been spamming false scam accusations all around the Internet to mess up my Google results (check out "martti malmi"). They've been posting inter-linked BS articles to forums, various complaint sites and their fake news site hpub.org. For example:Which is of course completely made up, I haven't even worked with foreign customers at my current job (the "customer" claimed to be from Nebraska). I'm surprised by the amount of effort they put into this. The motive is probably emotional, because profit-wise they're just wasting their time.FNIB has been "defending" their own reputation and smearing Mitchell Bourne (worldly) among others, with similar SEO tactics on the same forums.I'm not sure as to what extent FNIB is a scam business, but it sure seems scammy as hell. It's incorporated in New Zealand (http://www.business.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/3473593/detail) and directed by Stuart Poppleton from Wakefield, UK. Can't tell if Mr. Poppleton is the actual person running the business, as 100% of the shares are owned by a Hong Kong company (http://en.hkcomp.info/hongkong/cps.jsp?key=1634921-a797a24a). FNIB is also behind the obscure Swiftcoin "alternative cryptocurrency":http://www.swiftcointalk.org/ - Funny Bitcointalk clone. Off-topic section description: "Other topics that might be of interest to bitcoiners". Oops.http://www.firstnationalbnak.com/ - "MtGox of Swiftcoin"http://www.oswift.com/ - eBay of Swiftcoin, apparentlyhttp://www.fxboss.info/ - Tips on getting rich quickThey had photoshopped office pics on their site:I guess everyone can decide for themselves if they want to trust their money to a company like First National Innovation Brokers. EDIT: History of Changes at http://www.business.govt.nz/fsp/app/ui/fsp/version/searchSummaryCompanyFSP/FSP154824/6.do:Time to move on to the next scheme, it seems. Auctioning eurobtc.com. Starting price 1 BTC. Make an offer in this thread or in a private message. Can someone with wiki permissions create a page "Press contacts"? Moving forum.bitcoin.org to bitcointalk.org was a good move that made bitcoin.org less political. I would say the same about moving the press stuff out.Resources page (http://bitcoin.org/en/resources) is already useful for press, we don't need a separate press page. There we can add links to the interviewee wiki page and possibly other sources.With all respect to Saivann and others who have worked with the site. I agree it's unjust to hand-pick a small group of "bitcoin representatives" for the press page. The bitcoin-press mailing list is not very democratic or transparent either. I vote for removing it.How about replacing the interviewee list with a link to the wiki? A wiki page where we can add all volunteers who meet some notability requirements. There should be a short description of the contact's association with bitcoin and a couple links from previous interviews.Linking the press page to https://bitcoinfoundation.org/contact seems reasonable too."Pictures" and "Quotes" sections could be moved to the wiki. "Press coverage" is rather harmless, but maybe unnecessary - reporters shouldn't need help finding bitcoin related news articles. Maybe add a Twitter link? I've started coding this based on Freenet's Library plugin. I'll let you know when I have something that works.Slides from my presentation at Bitcoin Cafe Helsinki: http://www.rvl.io/mmalmi/identifi Thanks for the links and ideas.Looks like there actually is an indexing tool for Freenet: https://wiki.freenetproject.org/B-tree_index. Would be cool if Freenet could be used for all the networking stuff. I'll be looking into it.Namecoin is a name/value system and it's not the best option for storing tons of data, like relations in this case. Social networking based WoT is the only good option I can think of. Users could evaluate relations' trustworthiness based on their creator's location in the social network. Off to crawl Facebook -> Here's my idea in a nutshell: A distributed network that models identity and reputation as a graph, where different kinds of user identifiers are nodes and user-created relations are links between them. The relations can be evaluated with various algorithms and criteria, such as social network based web of trust to make it sybil-proof.The network allows users to check the reputation and other connections of a previously unknown identity. For example, you could decide to borrow 20 bucks to a stranger in a pub after finding out he's your 3rd degree connection on FB and has mostly positive ratings. Or you could write reviews of policemen, teachers, judges or other public servants with whom you can't choose not to interact.Reputation that is instantly visible to everyone is a big incentive to not be a butthead. Maybe even bigger than threat of imprisonment, and definitely more cost-efficient and p2p. 1. Data model1.1 IdentifierUnique or non-unique identifier of a user. Examples:NamePhone numberEmail addressGPG keyFacebook usernameDate of birthPhotographFields: type, value.1.2 RelationA link between two or more identifiers. Relations are GPG-signed by their creator. Examples:ID1 says: "I traded with ID2 and it went smoothly"ID1 says: ID2, ID3 and ID4 belong to the same ownerID1 says: ID2 and ID3 are Friends on FacebookID1 borrowed $100 to ID2 (signed by both parties)Fields: Type, value, timestamp, target IDs, signatures.2. Distributed data storage and indexThis is more of an open question and I'm asking for your ideas on it. The network must be resistant to censorship and political pressure. In addition to storing the static identifiers and relations, for searching we need a dynamic inverted index that links identifiers to the relations they're involved in.Freenet would be a solution for the static part but it doesn't solve the indexing problem. Distributed indexing could be done with a distributed hash table structure, for which there are existing libraries like Kademlia. Bootstrapping would be easier if we could use an existing indexing network like YaCy, but it doesn't support Freenet atm.3. Use caseWeb site where users can rate their experience with public servants.1. Alice logs on to the site with her FB account2. The site creates an ID with type "user@facebook.com" and Alice's username as value.3. Alice writes a review of Bob the policeman.4. Alice adds Bob's full name, phone number, email and FB username to the review.5. The site creates a relation that connects Alice's ID with all the Bob's IDs she entered. The relation content is Alice's review and it's signed with the site's GPG key (because the site verifed Alice's FB identity).6. The newly created relation is published to the network.Now the review can be found by any of the Bob's IDs entered by Alice. Changes or additions to Bob's details can be added later with new relations. Bob could write a reply to the review and sign it with his WoT-verified GPG key, for instance.Ideas and suggestions welcome! Where's that?It's legal, although not advised. But yeah, it got me thinking if I should only sell BTC, not buy. It would be safer and without the hassle of sending envelopes. Sirius is back in the business. I'm opening EuroBTC.com, a site for buying and selling bitcoins for euros in the mail. Before officially opening the service, I'd like to invite all Bitcointalk users to try it out so I can see how it goes. So feel free to buy or sell.https://eurobtc.comusername: testpassword: userAny questions or suggestions are welcome.EDIT 23.4.2012: I'm temporarily closing the site. All orders made so far will be processed.
Sorry, the bounty is closed already. Hopefully someone else would be willing to donate for the cause. They don't actually sell anything so they wouldn't qualify for this bounty. However, I'd be happy to offer a separate 500 BTC bounty if they accept BTC deposits and withdrawals to/from USD accounts. I don't mind if the bounty recipient works for the big company. You can freely divide the bounty in any way you want. What I care about is that the big company starts accepting BTC You should contact me when the business has initially shown interest in accepting BTC. You can make any arrangements you want that help you prove that you should get the bounty. I'll use my best judgement to reward the right person. I'm offering a 1000 BTC bounty for getting a major business to accept Bitcoins as payment. Conditions:The business should have at least tens of thousands of customers and a revenue of at least 50 -100 million USD.The business must accept Bitcoins as payment for the most of their services.The business must provide a reasonably convenient way to pay with Bitcoins. If it's an internet business, they should process the Bitcoin payments automatically.The bounty recipient(s) must prove that they convinced the business to start accepting Bitcoins. Contact Sirius by a PM or IRC when the business has shown interest in accepting Bitcoins.The bounty will be paid when the business has accepted Bitcoins as payment for 3 months. If they accept Bitcoins for less than 3 months but at least 3 weeks, the bounty will be 200 BTC.The bounty expires on 31.12.2011. The business must make the decision to try out Bitcoins before that.These terms are subject to change.Ask me if you're unsure if your business qualifies. Feel free to contribute to the bounty amount.Suggestion: Try to get a poker site to accept BTC  100 BTC offered.I bought it back in 2009 and ran my own exchange for some time. Exchange owners, here's your chance to be the first Google result for "bitcoin exchange" Auction starting price 100 BTC. Auction closes when it seems that nobody is offering more. I'll announce all bids here, you can send a PM if you don't want to post. Minimum raise 5 BTC.Highest bid so far: 250 BTCSold for 250 BTC. Bitcoin value will go up again when practical and easy client programs hit the market. That's when non-geeks can start using Bitcoin in everyday transactions. The Android app is a step in the right direction and BitcoinJS sounds very promising. Depends on context  Perhaps we can get a good post / bad post mod up and running to do the job. The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.Some guidelines:1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.2. No zero value posts or threads, like "SELL SELL SELL"3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.4. No referral code spam5. No NSFW content Running an exchange takes more time than anybody can give out for free.Intersango is the open source exchange platform developed and used by Britcoin. We could set up some post quality requirements and hire more mods to enforce. But the forum policy has always been contrary to that. Thread rating and autohide of bad threads would be better, if there are suitable smf plugins for that. It's the profit margin of mining that will go down, not the bitcoin value. Growth of the bitcoin supply stays the same. I guess this is noteworthy: Wikileaks: "Namecoin and Bitcoin will be revolutionary http://is.gd/8zKOTT see "Orwell's Dictum" http://is.gd/2hsOWh" Bitcoin.org moved to sf.net hosting, which unfortunately doesn't support https. Please use irc instead of chat threads like this. Bitcoin.org is at sf.net and devs have access. Nordea is a nordic bank that serves internationally and offers a (fairly complex) XML API you can use for all that. Danske Bank uses the same api afaik. Just get a bank account with an API, start an exchange with lower fees and you'll surely attract a lot of users. Automated transfers are the key feature. I think I saw Bitcoin connect to tor nodes even in the early days. I don't think linking to a gambling site is illegal in Japan?
"That [deflation] is considered very destructive in today's economies, mostly because when it occurs, it is unexpected," says Roberts. But he thinks that won't apply in an economy where deflation is expected. "In a Bitcoin world, everyone would anticipate that, and they know what they got paid would buy more then than it would now." - Russ Roberts, professor of economics at George Mason University. http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/37619/page1/ No, the "server" version would be standalone as it is now.Well, why not have both wallet and blockchain servers and let the user pick. Bitcoin.org is on sf.net and they don't support https. We have a StartSSL certificate now. We now have a valid certificate. What do you think about adding wallet server functionality to the Bitcoin software? It would help establish a wallet protocol standard and make it easy for anyone to start a wallet server. People could then use their mobile and other lightweight clients to manage their account on any server. I believe the average user would rather use a 3rd party wallet service than download and store the block chain and worry about backups. Just like most people don't want to run their own email server, but the paranoid guy still has the option to do so.We already have support for separate accounts, they just lack authentication. Another useful and user-friendly feature would be the user@domain.com address scheme proposed by Genjix.TL;DR Bitcoin should have clients and servers like the email protocol. Bitcoin.org/smf/... should redirect to forum.bitcoin.org/... Doesn't work? Is it? Theymos, how did you fix the problem last time? Maybe it reappeared with the server relocation.I'll be looking into the certificate thing soon. Is there any open source pool software yet? Might help if anyone could easily set up their pool. Buy the government and turn it off   People can find their posts from their profile. I think better not use moved-threads. Should we upgrade to the Advanced Reputation System? Created. Maybe link to instawallet.org should be added to the getting started page? Free competition doesn't mean that everyone is a producer of the good.You don't want to worry about the complex process how the materials for your computer are gathered from all over the world, turned into components, assembled and finally delivered to you. You don't need to, you just buy it. Granting a violently enforced monopoly to computer production would ruin the industry just like state has ruined justice. The state monopoly of legal violence is there only because enough people accept it. It's not like the state (or a private company) could violently keep all the citizens under its power. In a free market society you might not even see very big pools of capital (corporations) forming. People handle capital much more efficiently when it's their own, not shared with everyone or owned by some distant capitalist. It's just taxation and other state bureaucracy that makes distribution of ownership less practical in some cases.Big corporations tend to have management problems similar to those seen in communist countries. Instead of a mega-corporation like Siemens, you'd have a lot more efficient network of private entrepreneurs who own their personal means of production, or perhaps pool resources when bigger machines and tools are required. People would more often sell the results of their work rather than working hours. Idle days spent at the office only because of hour-based work contract would be history. The front page should display how many players are online. Porn could be moved to its own wiki page if we want to clean up the list.
Split from the Silk Road thread. Split CP discussion to off-topic. Now that we've been featured on Forbes and Time, I think Der Spiegel would be the next step. Thanks for quick completion, Luke!You can test the URIs on Firefox (3.5 and above):Type about:config into the Location Bar (address bar) and press Enter.Right-click -> New -> Boolean -> Name: network.protocol-handler.expose.bitcoin -> Value -> falseCreate an html page with a bitcoin-link: <a href="bitcoin:bitcoinaddress">payment link</a>Click the link and you will be asked which application to open it with. Open with the bitcoinuri binary. Link added. The idea is that you can store the wallet anywhere and use it through a lightweight terminal, without connecting to the network. For example you could choose to store your coins at mybitcoin.com or your own server. Then you could use them with a Firefox extension or an Android UI.I think it would be easiest to go with the current JSON-RPC stuff and automatically enable it, or at least add it to the options menu. Well planned is not done. Any updates on this? I'd like to offer a 50BTC bounty for implementing bitcoin: URIs in the main client. Electricity for mining  I believe that non-aggression, although prevalent, wouldn't be an absolute in a free market based law. Laws would be rules that people are generally ready to enforce by pointing guns at others (at their own cost), like prohibition of stealing or murder. People might be forcefully prevented from building a nuclear waste station in a residential area or organizing outdoor raves without compensation for noise. Or people might not be punished for preventing someone from committing a suicide, for example. People generally find these kinds of things perfectly reasonable and just. ZayPay offers SMS and phonecall payments in 44 countries. They have an easy-to-use API. You could make a bitcoin selling service with a simple interface:1. Choose your country (to show the available payment amounts and options)2. Choose amount3. Enter your Bitcoin address4. Click the payment button provided by ZayPay.This service would be a very easy and instant way to purchase small amounts of coins. It would probably be hugely popular. Feel free to implement  What's the correct capitalization? Capitalized "Bitcoin" when talking about the system or software, and "bitcoin" when using as a unit of currency? Have you checked the option in settings? It was actually a non-spammers list that didn't have our ip. I enabled the notifications now. Translations are a good point. I don't think we need a TL;DR description of Bitcoin at bitcoin.org. Weusecoins.com is a better introduction for newbies. Bitcoin.org should have a short description of the project, direct download links (icons for win, mac, linux) and links to other Bitcoin resources. The video can be thrown out to keep things simple, although it might be good to catch the visitor's attention.tcatm, I like the page structure and footer style of your version. The logo and the yellow text background should be changed. Some pro could design the logo. Body_wrap looks cleaner without the stripes. We could try something lighter and more colorful instead of the dark gray theme. Trying #B0318E for the language bar background already made it look more fun  Fooling around with Firebug is fun. Thanks for contributing. It's browser-compatible, looks somewhat cleaner, doesn't need scrolling and supports translations. No video, but weusecoins.com is linked anyway. The intro text could be shorter. What do you guys think? I made it the front page. Now at least the front page is slashdot-proof I'll still be fine-tuning the CSS. In the spirit of open source, everyone is welcome to improve the index.html in any way and I'll set it up if it's better. Add to github or wiki?  This better: http://www.bitcoin.org/newsite2/ ? I made a proposal for the new page: http://www.bitcoin.org/newsite/. Feel free to comment or edit. Wanna setup a Bitcoin-Zaypay site anyone? SMS and phonecall payments. It would be a very easy way to buy small amounts of coins internationally.MtGox's and Britcoin's establishment of legal status should make it easier for bigger business to accept coins. Spesmilo or other lightweight clients could be promoted for newbies. Bitcoin as a browser plugin would be golden, even if for MyBitcoin accounts only.
The accounts are restored now. Competing with big suppliers sounds difficult. You could buy used stuff from ebayers and bitcoiners who are in need of quick money. Verify it works and resell with a profit margin. The laissez-faire policies described on the site are classical minarchism and many people here are surely fine with that. This IP thing divides opinions, but I think many libertarians would still prefer the relatively free state over less free states.Onarchy, 100K is a lot of money to ask as donations. You'll need to convince people that the funds can actually be raised and things are really going to happen. A donation counter would be cool. Have you looked into Kickstarter or some other fundraising site that would allow donations on the condition that the required total amount will be reached?Getting donations will surely be easier if the initial negotiations are successful. Having a bigger team of representatives for the project would help build confidence. This is a huge project for one person, and random internet guys don't know you well enough to trust that you can do it. I'm not talking about the current system of centrally planned law, but polycentric free market law. Nobody would provide you an insurance that shields you from prosecution when you murdered somebody. That's just unsustainably expensive, like selling insurances that pay you for intentionally burning down your own house.As you pointed out, making a law means to point guns at people. In a free market, laws would be rules that people are generally ready to enforce by pointing guns at others. I highly doubt that downloading a song from the internet would count. In a statist law monopoly people don't have to personally pay the costs of the laws they support and that's why we have stupid and invasive laws. I find the deduction of "rights" by complex philosophical argumentation quite uninteresting and useless.Medieval Iceland, American settler communities and Somalia's Xeer are historical examples of polycentric common law, and they weren't violent dystopies but really efficient and peaceful systems compared to what we have now.Thanks for using Bitcoin. I think people are waiting to see more discussion and generally get to know the project better before they donate. I don't think IP laws are economically viable and thus they wouldn't exist if the law was formed in a free market process. Ie. justice insurance companies wouldn't be willing to sell insurances that compensate for copying of your work without permission. But that's impossible to tell before we see a society based on free market common law.Anyway, I think this is a good enough reason to give it a try. It would still be way better than any other state in the world. IP laws can (hopefully) be changed later if they are found unjust. Extinction of arbitrary state violence is a stated goal of the project. Of course it requires a major exemption from the enclosing country's laws.   Governments tend to get corrupted over decades (just like the US did), but yeah, I'd still give it a shot. At least it would be great as long as it lasts.I hope you can get more people to work with the effort. That is of course easier when you get donations and there is progress in the negotiations. This is better than redirecting straight to the wiki. Wanna make a pretty static html for this, anyone?  Or find some free template. Sounds very interesting! Considering relations with foreign states, it could be a good strategic choice to have a nominal "government" even if the country was practically a free-market "anarchy".I might be interested in donating euros when I know more about the project and the people behind it  Yeah, weusecoins.com does a great job as an introductory site. Bitcoin.it is a good community portal and knowledge base. So what should bitcoin.org be? Since bitcoin.org is the number one search result, there should be at least some introductory stuff and downloads. "Less software and more currency" sounds good. We could translate it to as many languages as possible. Thanks to all who have offered help. I'm going through the offers and will contact some of you. New volunteers are still welcome. Flattr, Mozilla and Dialogix for example. Or any site from here. Bitcoin.org is the most visible part of the project, so why settle for the second best?

Drupal is useful mostly for translations, but if some other system can handle them, it's ok too. Some easy way to generate static or well cached pages would rock. Bounty campaign or fundraiser sounds good. I created a bounty specification page on the wiki. Please contribute if you have good ideas.Should we put the "Trade" and "FAQ" links to the front page content instead of navigation menu? Should we have the contact details on the front page, so we'd only need 1 page?Should we have a news section? I'd say no and keep bitcoin.org as a simple introductory page for newbies. Regular users can find news elsewhere. Help with that is welcome too. I created a child board for the chinese students. Mods, please move the chinese threads there. I'd like to offer 500 BTC for a really cool website. 250 BTC for semi-cool. Anyone interested in helping out with bitcoin.org? We need someone who has the time and skill to optimize and manage a high-traffic server. The server should be made to easily withstand slashdotting and other major news coverage. We're currently running a LAMP on a Rackspace VPS, but the hosting can be changed if necessary.It's fine if you want to do only the optimization part, but maintenance help is also very welcome. If you're interested, please post here or send me a PM to tell me about your experience, optimization ideas and how much time you have to spare.
Still working on it? I'd set it up on bitcoin.org if it's ready. Doesn't need to be a Drupal theme, static pages load better.I'll pay you 20 BTC for the job  Bitcoin.it is already hosted on Kalyhost. It's safer to have bitcoin.org on another host so that both sites won't go down in case of server failure or some other factor. That "nothing backs it up" crap again. Bitcoin is backed by a good number of various services and products. I like this. The logo could be different though. We could get some professional to finish the visual appearance for the wanted layout.The current plan is indeed to keep the main page and wiki separate. The main page should be an advertisement to newbies, while the wiki contains all the details. JesusTheCaffeine's idea of explaining the benefits for consumers and merchants is good, but maybe not on the front page if it's too much text. Although the forum has the advantage of reputation by post history, I think some other platform could be better for trading. Like biddingpond.com. http://twitter.com/MtGox The rules forbid trading of goods that are illegal in the seller's or buyer's country. It was a tough decision to make and I wanted to hear bitcoiners' opinions on this. I didn't ignore the results - this is a poll, not a vote. 1/3 of people don't want drug dealing here, and that's not a small minority. The purpose of this rule is to keep the forum a place that you can present publicly.Anything that is not forbidden is allowed, using common sense of course. Illegal goods are now banned on the marketplace (rules). The decision is based on the notion that there's no need to keep that kind of content on this particular forum. The cost of having to go somewhere else is smaller than the cost of possible bad reputation on this forum. 1. Trading of goods that are illegal in the seller's or buyer's country is forbidden.2. Insert a [CLOSED] tag to the subject line when your offer is no more open. Yes. We also need to solve the server problem. It's currently unable to handle big traffic like slashdotting, which we'll surely be getting more of. Making the main page static helps a lot, and using lighttpd could also be considered. The best explanation for Monty Hall: Make the number of doors 1,000,000. You pick one of the doors and the host opens 999,998 doors that don't have the prize. Your choice: 1/1000,000, the other door: 999,999/1000,000. Definitely. Ok for Gavin? Things like CP and spam are already forbidden by unwritten rules (common sense). In many legislations (Scandinavian countries for example) server admins aren't responsible for illegal forum threads. I'm leaning toward having no explicit rules, unless it starts giving us too much trouble at some point. The forum won't go down because of somebody selling drugs, it's just a matter of reputation. Sex and drugs are very good for publicity and grassroots marketing, but possibly a turn-off for brands that want to avoid association. I don't think the association thing is a problem, but we can change the rules later if it becomes that way. We can of course have the unwritten rule to keep controversial stuff low-profile like it is now.edit 19.2.:Illegal goods are now banned on the marketplace (rules). The decision is based on the notion that there's no need to keep that kind of content on this particular forum. The cost of having to go somewhere else is smaller than the cost of possible bad reputation on this forum. Ok, spoiler warning: Netherlands.Thanks for the offer! 4-6 April, Central Europe.I don't know the details, but I think these kinds of events usually pay for the speakers. I was asked if we could get someone to represent Bitcoin in a high-profile financial business conference in Europe. Any volunteers or recommendations? I asked Bruce Wagner, but other ideas are welcome in case he can't go. Anybody with good presentation skills and Bitcoin knowledge will do. I need to find a suitable person asap.Hype: somebody might throw a $10M investment out of their back pocket there  No problem, I announced this after your post. Threads about listed services are still welcome.
Traders' list has been moved to the wiki. Please contribute to the Bitcoin press hits wiki article. Redirected bitcoin.org to bitcoin.it, at least the forum works now. For some reason this server was very slow even though only 50% mem and 5% cpu usage.  Interesting how Bitcoin already creates new e-business models  Such creativity. Fake. Maybe bitcoin.org should be a visually refined site (like mozilla.org) that has just the key points listed, plus links to the wiki and downloads? Wikis have a lot of text in a small font and are poor for 5 second impressions. The wiki is better for regular bitcoiners instead. Having the trade page in a wiki would be a relief.Satoshi owns the domain and I'm in charge of the server. True. There's a proposal of an URI scheme in the wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/URI_Scheme. Not implemented in the official client yet. Here's a URI and QR code generator: http://tcatm.github.com/bitcoin-js-remote/ I used to write "bitcoin.org" on every euro note that passed through my hands, but eventually forgot it. Time for a new campaign?  Every bank in Finland. Also, all banks here support instant, irrevocable online payments from their customers with a simple interface. There are 3rd party services that have accounts in every bank, let the customer choose which to use, and forward the payment to the merchant. It would be very useful if there was an international service like that. My bank snail mails lists of 300 one-use keys you need when logging in. A quicker but perhaps more expensive option is to send the keys in SMS. You could advertise this on anonymous channels like imageboards or chatroulette  Horny girls teaching you how to use Bitcoin. This has big publicity potential and could increase the user base. It's just a bit difficult for them to build reputation as most people don't want to publicly admit they bought from there. Maybe private recommendations will do. Or people can say "I know somebody who successfully bought from them". New wiki: https://bitcoin.it The vertical optimization looks good. Simplified transaction status and address book tab are nice too. "At your address" should be "Your address", as balance and the shown address aren't related. What do you think should be in the Market menu?The description could be something prettier than a Bitcoin address. When sending a payment, the user could add a note to self, but in a way that can't be confused as a message to the recipient.We should add API options to the options panel. And maybe the option to add peers manually. Duh, copypasta. Systems like this may be our biggest competitors, but they can also pave the way for mobile payments and the idea of "virtual currency". And we can get good ideas about how the UI should work. Seconded. External link directories are welcome. Valam, if you want to make btcmart.com more inviting, you should translate the page title "Досква бесплатных объявлений". Hey, these are cool. You should make at least a simple website with samples and get added to /trade. What do you think about Peter Thiel, the PayPal founder? Funds seasteading, calls himself a libertarian, attends Bilderberg and doesn't afraid of anything.
Rake-free poker sounds like a killer app to me. Trade = buy / sell. I moved the currency exchange section first and made the descriptions a bit clearer. Somalia's problems are Islam and the culture of violence that evolved there instead of business culture during the government days. Also the foreign armies and the puppet government funded by western countries. But as the report shows, living standards there are now less bad by most measures. Now that there are more advanced services accepting European bank wires, I don't see the need to restore the old bitcoinexchange.com. However, I might restore the SMS buying option. It works well for people who just want to get a few coins quickly and buy something small. Competitors are welcome. I recommend ZayPay for a gateway. The UK is a member of SEPA so transfers within Europe have the same fees as domestic transfers. The bank may charge something for currency conversion though. No such plans   We're planning to meet in some izakaya around Shibuya. I'm in Tokyo 19.-21.3. and we're planning to have a meetup with MagicalTux. All bitcoiners welcome!Doodle: http://doodle.com/bg8zngecdaewdg4m Could be done, but not very high priority. We don't need Wikileaks-grade security measures yet. No more this stuff here. Dragonheart 120 BTC I made a wiki article for bitcoin.org front page translations: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin.org_translations. You can add new languages there and keep the existing translations updated. Should we add the github link to bitcoin.org front page? Satoshi owns the domain so this is up to him. It's better if one person doesn't carry too much responsibility over the Bitcoin economy and community. But if you can't get a foreign bank account otherwise, maybe I can help you or find somebody reliable. I'll send you a PM. Unless there is some Russian law prohibiting it, you can open an account by mail:You can contact Nordea's international banking department in Finland, or maybe the Russian office can also help. I recommend taking a look at what Nordea bank has to offer. Nordea is a Nordic bank which also has offices in Baltic countries and Russia. Foreign corporate customers can open a bank account in Finland or another Scandinavian country. You can get a web login for your bank account. They also have an XML API, but it's rather complex compared to Liberty Reserve or Pecunix.http://www.nordea.fi/Corporate+customers/Welcome+to+Nordea/International+branch/1148462.htmlhttp://www.nordea.com/cm Good point, I should search for female users when looking for spam accounts to delete  It's no problem. Satoshi expressed his opinion that publicity in any other context would be good, but Wikileaks accepting donations in BTC would bring too much pressure on us at this point.Thanks for spreading the word.  MagicalTux, can you add a Russian language version? We could copy some pages from the old wiki. The database backups contain private stuff like password hashes (=passwords), PM's and email addresses, so we can't give them out. Only bitcoin.org admins (Satoshi, Gavin, me) have the access.Yes. We'll make sure there are always backups available.
It's now making daily backups to remote servers. Thanks for help ShadowOfHarbringer. Don't worry, not long  An attacker could mess up the original file that is pulled by the backup servers, but I'm not too worried about that happening. Old backups can be stored for at least a week or two.The server now makes daily backups automatically, but doesn't rsync them yet. Bzipped size about 50 MB. The wiki link at bitcoin.org now points to bitcoin.it. What's wrong with WTFPL, besides the name? Stability problem was due to processes being killed by out of memory error. I doubled the server memory and usage stays below 50% now, so it's not a problem anymore. Still, it's good if we don't have to rely on a single server. Imagine Wikileaks having just one rackspace vps...  The wiki was my quick choice for ease of install and it was set up before the slashdotting, when the community was way smaller. We could upgrade to MediaWiki if we wanted, but that's not very useful as we have bitcoin.it now. I'll look more into this next weekend. Rsync sounds good. Distribution to multiple servers is good. What do you think, should we keep the "Documentation" wiki, or link straight to bitcoin.it? I think the wiki might become better and more complete documentation than a separately maintained documentation page. The main site could be mirrored, but keeping the forum database in sync on multiple servers sounds difficult. Automated backups of the database to a remote location would be useful if something unexpected happens with the hosting. Any ideas how to store the backups? Maybe encrypt them and distribute to multiple servers around the world. Distributing them through a single gateway (Dropbox, Tahoe-LAFS?) would save bandwidth. Changed it to "... based digital currency" like it is on the front page. Should the term "blockchain" be explained before it's used, or replaced with "transaction history"? In case of Bitcoin, the banks can give out wallet backups for each user to ensure they're full reserving. I'm changing the server, might still take some time to get it running. Like a week or so. But there may be other -services soon too. Who owns #bitcoin-talk? Gj  Btw, cooler bitcoin logos here. This would make for a good Wikipedia source. Dunno if good enough for republishing the article though. Exchangers could maybe use an international clearing service like http://www.clearing-house.net/ if they accept small customers. Should we have a "Project development" section where you can talk about organization, bounty campaigns, advertising etc.? Any other name ideas? "Workshop" or "Project organization"? Twitter search brings up interesting stuff these days. It's common but very immature to call somebody an "indoctrinated religious fanatic who can't think for himself and ignores reality" because he disagrees with you in a debate. These kinds of feelings are usually the speaker's own cognitive bias. Even if you're sure that it's not just your emotional fuss from the debate, it's better to keep these kinds of thoughts for yourself as they lead the discussion in no good direction.
I agree. People usually want to enjoy life and spend their money before they die.I like economics. You can always prove by either buying or short selling that your predictions are not just trolling. Sounds like a quality service. I hope you'll find Bitcoin useful. If you want to make the wait shorter, you could enable the account without confirmations and disable it later in case it's a double spending attempt. My views on speculation:1. It's based on voluntary trade, hence not immoral. Banning speculation means to make a threat of violence against voluntary traders. That's also hypocrisy; you need to make an economical speculation yourself if you are to condemn someone as a speculator.2. Speculation is economically beneficial, as pointed out by others. When speculators see a shortage is coming, their action drives up the prices and adds to the incentive to increase production, smoothing or even preventing the forthcoming crisis. Similarly it helps decrease excess production before it starts causing problems. Speculation, along with other phenomena of the free market, is a beautiful organic and emergent process that channels future expectations and information into the structure of production.  Doesn't bother me if someone makes a profit out of it. Also greatly improves liquidity.I think speculation has been entirely positive for the Bitcoin project. It's fascinating how Bitcoin got its initial value when the real economy didn't exist yet, out of the expectation that it would be more valuable later on. Sounds good. It's easier to get some professional do it when the project definition is clear (script + some kind of a visual idea).+1 Thai baht symbol has one line, Bitcoin symbol has two. Welcome to the forum!It's easy to mass-remove accounts that are older than a few weeks, have 0 posts and mention a website in the user details. Post spammers are more annoying, but usually catch the admin's attention even quicker. Server rebooted. Any better now? Cool! Best Bitcoin logos I've seen so far. Did you try the same layout with the official Bitcoin-coin? All e-mail notifications are disabled so we don't end up on a spammer list. You could start reselling VPSes, web hotels, file storage and other digital services and accept BTC as one option. Or actually any digital or even non-digital services from providers that have reselling programs, like Rackspace does. You could resell them anonymously, unless the provider really wants customer contact details. There's even profit to be made if this is done professionally. European and Asian people could sell American stuff localized to their native language and target advertisement better.What think? Too bad I just started in a full-time work lately so I'm only able to add this to the end of my todo queue. Sorry to disappoint you, but I just removed 100+ spam accounts.  Maybe later. Ok, since there were no heavy objections I put the porn sites behind a fancy show/hide javascript.I guess talksugar.com has payment instructions somewhere? Yes, but only the content part and no downloads.Done  Can we just make different language versions of a deleted page without getting them removed? Let's do it if we can. I can write a version in Finnish. Is this eligible for a Wikipedia source, or should it be a link to the original publication? Good incentive to continue developing.  But he wasn't the only one generating. I started generating in Spring 2009, and the number of connections was around 2-10 at that time. Thanks for the French and Esperanto translations!I don't see a previous French translation of the main page. Having a porn site accept Bitcoin is definitely good to catch people's interest. Good for advertising on IRC, forums and other social media . I just wonder if there are many sites on the trade list that don't want to be associated with a porn site.(edit: ok, the material could be of better quality ) This needs to be integrated with social networking to be a breakthrough product. There are existing distributed social networks, but I'm most interested in Diaspora because of its media potential and the funding they've managed to gather, from mr. Zuckerberg among others. Diaspora accounts are based on PGP, so the integration shouldn't be too difficult. Yes, that's good.
Can you add the temporary payment instructions to the site? That's been the standard requirement for getting your site added. Qugel.com is an exception as they're a notably big shop but seemingly have their technical limitations with eBay shops. Do they offer payment confirmations to a user specified reporting url? That would enable easy bitcoin integration with webapps without running your own bitcoin server. Probably you'd need to call their server back to ensure that the report really was from them. That's how ZayPay does it. They should still get a better SSL certificate. That CACert thing makes using MyBitcoin way too difficult for the average user and too bothersome for many advanced users. 14200% yearly interest sounds ok. Yeah, they don't show trade prices in , but you can easily pay in $ even if your PayPal account is in . Go ahead with asking, I absolutely don't mind more -trading. Mt Gox and Bitcoin Market are already easy to use with -PayPal. Or would you like to see a similar bid/ask service that accepts wire transfers? Development ideas and feedback are welcome. It works fine for me if you fill in all the bank detail fields. Anyways, I'll fix it when I have time. I added the section "Donation-accepting organizations and projects". Send me a PM if there's some site I forgot to add. Is flattring reversible btw? Can you draw back your flattring? Ok, I made an exception with this one and added it to the trade page. Hopefully they could still add the instructions on their page. Thanks for your screens Willsway, but I placed a bit smaller screenshots on the front page, more similar to the old ones. Hmm... would it run on Maemo with the same code then? Any other advantages? Better than XP Anyone interested in making a French translation? Twitter shows there might be interest towards the project from that direction.  Do you think we could find some prettier screenshots to the bitcoin.org front page? Maybe Mac screenshot or Windows Aero. I created the board "Other" where you can post in other languages. If some language becomes popular there, we can make a board for it. The random number could be picked using a randomization algorithm seeded with a predefined random seed such as stock exchange ending numbers on some day in the future. Only sites that offer services or products are added to the list. Of course you could make a list of donation-accepting sites on the wiki. This should perhaps be reworded, it sounds like we're taking it for granted that they'll help us if needed. I added to the FAQ the warning to back up after each transaction. Is it necessary btw to stop the client before making a backup? That's a bit inconvenient. Automatic backups would be useful indeed.
I added "How to help Bitcoin" to the FAQ.I don't think it matters very much if the sidebar link says "Documentation" or "Wiki". Or does it? I kind of like the idea. The faq and the translations could be easier kept up to date, and we wouldn't need a separate wiki and cms. You could use the same user account for the wiki and the forum. My only objection is that wikis don't look as good and are more difficult to navigate than pages created with a cms (Drupal).It's quite a job trying to choose a good combination of forums, wikis, cms'es and and project management tools. Maybe mediawiki+smf+trac? Can you add the Bitcoin payment instructions on the page so we could add it to bitcoin.org/trade? There's already http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=how_to_help linked on the front page of the wiki. I actually talked about Bitcoin with the EFF chairman a few days ago, he said it sounds cool and forwarded the link to some other EFF people.  There's already a thread about this here. Does it work correctly now? I had made some forum code changes to disable PM email notification, but just reverted most of them as unnecessary. Winland If you want to upgrade the BiddingPond.com logo, you can give http://cooltext.com/ a try. So I just send you my wallet file and you'll fix it?  It's setup.nsi in the svn. нормально. Is this service reliable? Should it be added to bitcoin.org/trade?Является ли эта услуга надежным? Должна ли она быть добавлены к bitcoin.org/trade? (Thanks to Google Translate for the great translation ) This can still be used by the vast number of merchants or companies who do have a website. Those who don't can use a plugin on their blog, webstore or social networking site.It's not wrong. We're developing here. Bump. I'll pay 100 BTC to the first one to make a "we accept Bitcoin" logo that I choose to put on BitcoinExchange.com. The text can be different, or even no text if you think it's good. It must be better than the current logo of course  Russian board created. Let me know if there's demand for a board in some other major language. I'd also change the address to domain.com/bcspec. Do you think we should switch to MediaWiki? Better support for translations and discussions, and most people are familiar with it. Originally I chose DokuWiki because of its easy installation and lightweightness. It's interesting that so many Russians have shown interest in the project. Thinking about the Russian culture and society, I'm not completely surprised why. I'll make a new board, let's see how many non-English-speaking users we'll get. In a reputation network the reviews could be digitally signed so others could mirror them on their domains. Diaspora's GPG support could be utilized.
I'm writing a modular Django app that implements this and is relatively easy to integrate with your own systems. It would be cool if someone did a similar php application.What interest me most are the "Friends" and "Blacklist" specifications, since they can be used for building a web-of-trust, and I don't think we should limit this to the Bitcoin economy only. Should we use a URL or some other unique identifier instead of a domain name, so you could rate services or individuals who don't have a domain of their own? That would integrate better with social networking systems like Diaspora. Some services also accept https connections only. Thanks. You can send updates when they're ready. I didn't find any mention of Bitcoin on the site. Is there? Thanks to Tao Wan for the Chinese FAQ. We'd appreciate if somebody could check the translation or fill in the missing questions. I don't need devalued sirius-dollars to compete with people who are more productive than I am. I ask a lower price. I don't see a problem here. Can you add these instructions to your site? Malicious websites could have a javascript that steals all your coins. Doesn't work interplanetarily... what a useless system  You can buy BTC with SMS / phone call at Bitcoin Exchange. Works in most western countries. Reviewing the forum member's posting history before making a transaction may be a good idea. To be honest, the vague description promising free stuff, poor layout with clipart images and lack of contact details gives a bad picture about your site. I wouldn't register my personal info on the site. Also, it's not stated what and how you can buy with Bitcoin. BatMud. Muds are maintained and played by geeks who might even be interested in BC. Another target audience might be the scandinavian Free Internet / pirate movement. Is there an estimate of the BTC amount value in dollars included? That could be gathered from the Bitcoin Market or with bcspec when it becomes more common. Sounds good. Here's some advice on keeping your emails out of Gmail users' spam folders. Updated. Thanks. I didn't find any info about what payment methods are accepted. You should add something about that.  Nenolod, you're welcome to join this forum or #bitcoin-dev on Freenode. It would be interesting to have a chat with you.BTW, Nenolod writes on Twitter:He hasn't sold anything at BitcoinExchange.com and the service is down just for technical maintenance. Should be up today or tomorrow. Maybe he meant that 1500  was the rate for the 84,732 BTC he supposedly has. Now that the network is still relatively small, he can create swings in the proof-of-work difficulty and to some extent in BTC price if he sells his coins in large quantities. Nothing too serious, I think. You could make an advertising network that is easy to join and pays provisions with Bitcoin.
399 BTC at the market price is worth a bit more than 6.75    Merchants will just have to adjust their rates - nobody will pay 10,000 BTC for a pizza anymore   In this case the bank might just store your encrypted wallet to ensure you that your money won't be lent out. Or you could just maintain the backup yourself without a bank. Doesn't work here, saysCode:./bitcoind: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.8' not found (required by ./bitcoind) Bitcoin makes a difference between storing money and lending money. If you want to store your money, you just make a backup of your wallet, possibly encrypted, to a safe place. It's clearly distinguishable from giving the control of your money to an investment bank which lends them for interest. In the mainstream bank system it's different: you deposit 1000$, the bank lends 900$ of it to someone but still shows 1000$ as your balance, and so the money supply is inflated. That's right. The price of any good on the market simply emerges from supply and demand. The more difficult thing is to determine what things affect supply and especially demand. Demand is affected by what people want now, what people think they and others will want in the future, time preferences and expectations of the future supply. That's a more complex equation that you can only make rough estimations about, much like the weather. That's why centrally planned economy works as well as making daily weather forecasts 1 year ahead.  Generating coins costs energy, but you can't turn them back to energy.The energy you get when you burn paper money is in most situations worth less than its printing costs were. A possible attack against the system was suggested on the IRC: an organization that controls an overwhelming amount of CPU power could start generating coins, and then stop generating when the proof-of-work difficulty gets very high after the next 2000 blocks. Normally it should take 2 weeks to generate 2000 blocks. If an attacker with 10 times more CPU power than the rest of the network were to increase the proof-of-work difficulty and then stop, the total block generation would become 10 times slower and the next difficulty readjustment would be after 20 weeks.By the time when Bitcoin is big enough to threaten the established currencies, hopefully there'll be no single party that has enough CPU power to do an attack like this. I added a new answer to the FAQ about the value of Bitcoin. That's a good idea. I updated the .txt files in my post on the first page. I added an answer about the value of Bitcoins to the FAQ.Any comments or grammatical improvements? Have you looked at Bitcoin Market? You can place your bids for buying BTC there. It takes a few minutes to get familiar with, but after that it's not too complicated. This sounds really interesting, might be a good way to build a web-of-trust for supporting the economy. I'll implement it on my service. Have you checked your spam folder? Added. You might want to check your rate however, since the market rate is about 50 times higher atm. In addition to the anonymous VPN, web hosting and filesharing providers mentioned before, it would be cool if some IT freelancer sites, many of which offer an escrow service, accepted BTC. Any other cool ideas? Anyone willing to help us with a Spanish, Russian or French translation here?  Looks like Bitthanks just went out of order.
Can you add payment instructions for BTC on your site so we can add it to bitcoin.org/trade? Something that was posted on the IRC: Technology Driven Universal Currency That was to be expected based on previous experience on some other forums. I still wonder why much of the criticism has such a negative tone and not "wow, sounds interesting, but I don't think it'll work". On the other hand, the people who joined the forum and IRC were very positive and interested. Maybe it's just that users with a mildly positive reaction don't comment as often as butthurts.Thanks for the submission Teppy  The API commands listed in the wiki can be used from the command line also, like this:Code:./bitcoind./bitcoind getinfoBitcoind is the headless daemon binary supplied with the download packages. Nice. Can you include the payment instructions for Bitcoin on your site? I'm thinking we should set that as a requirement for being added to the Trade page, so the random surfer doesn't get annoyed when he doesn't see the payment option that was promised. At the current market rate of 7$/1000BTC, 2000$ would buy you about 300,000 BTC. It would probably take some time to gather that many coins from sellers. However, the market rate goes up as you're increasing the demand for BTC, and you might end up having 200,000 BTC with the market price being around 10 - 20$/1000BTC after your last purchase.I don't recommend using Bitcoin for moving around large amounts of money that you want to immediately convert back to dollars, not until the economy is bigger.  The best practice is to generate a new address for each transaction. That's safer than sending to an IP and there's no message field to be misspelled. That's because the certificate is self-signed. Maybe we should have an option dialog that allows you to choose the IRC server and channel you connect to? How about this:Headline: Bitcoin releases version 0.3Body: The crypto-anarchist dream come true?  Bitcoin is a digital currency using cryptography and a distributed network to replace the need for a trusted central server. Escape the arbitrary inflation risk of centrally managed currencies: Bitcoin's total circulation is limited to 21 million coins. The coins are gradually released to the network's nodes based on the CPU power they contribute, so you can get a share of them by contributing your idle CPU time. [optional addition 1] There are multiple exchangers buying and selling Bitcoins for dollars, and even pizza has been successfully traded for these digital tokens. [optional addition 2] The newly released version 0.3 contains an API for programmatic sending and receiving of payments.The first sentence in body should be something stimulating and interesting. Does this sound ok or should it be something less radical? What do you think about the optional additions? Also, do you think the headline could be something more interesting or informative?Please notify me before we hit the Slashdot front page so I can make sure the server stays up.   The new logo in various sizes can be found here. Cryptohat I'd rather use just a big Bitcoin logo in place of the dollar. "In crypto we trust" is a nice unofficial slogan.   Good job. You should also show some info that makes the customer trust you (in addition to your name and website), people don't want to give their credit card details to just any site. But you probably know that already :]Actually, Bitcoins are valuable because there are people who accept Bitcoin for payment, i.e. they can be exchanged for other things of value. The limitedness of Bitcoins just helps keep that value. Having to pay for the same product with two payment methods would be disapproved by Steve Jobs.I think the best idea is to sell stuff at Craigslist or some other place where you can define the price in BTC. Or you could say the price in dollars but require the corresponding amount in bitcoins for payment. We could also market to Perfect Privacy (they already accept Liberty Reserve and WebMoney among others), Ipredator and Relakks. I think they'd benefit from having a truly anonymous payment option. I'll be in contact with them when the next release is out. Done. You don't need those extra line breaks in the cms.Thanks to Jonatan Lehtonen for the Swedish front page translation. That's great to hear. Hopefully you too can pay some of your bills directly in BTC some day. I guess that's why the forum still gets those annoying spam user registrations despite the captcha. Then the problem you have is not the reputation database but the community you live in. In a democracy the majority is supposed to be in control of the state guns anyway, so non-violent reputation databases won't be your first concern. The kind of people you want to deal with won't ostracize you because there's "he's an atheist!" from a random dude on your profile.Yes, that's an issue that needs to be kept in mind when planning the system. Similarly the problem of "recommend me and I'll recommend you" schemes between strangers needs to be eliminated. Maybe by requiring good connectedness to the social network in some way. Ok. I'm not hoping for a world without justice and protection organizations. I'm just envisioning a system to compensate for the shortcomings of the state monopolized courts we have now. They don't really serve the ideals you mentioned. In fact, it's often quite the opposite.The repercussion for beating up a kid who stole candy would be bad reputation. Nobody wants bad reputation. On the other hand, somebody who "robs" a rapist who refused to compensate to his victim, might even get a reputation increase. That would be even further incentive to not be a criminal, in addition to getting a lower reputation rating.
I don't think it's anyone's "right" to be an asshole and force others to still buy from him or be his friend. I think everyone should be free to choose who they associate or don't associate with, by whatever criteria they might have.Reputation systems have always ruled, because they're very useful. Long ago hearsay and gossip were the only channels to spread reputation, but the Internet opens us whole new possibilities that give us much more accurate information about things. People already check the reputation of shops and their products, or the employees they hire, from the Internet. I'm just speaking for a more refined version of the currently used systems. Instead of a million product review sites there would be one decentralized and well-adjusted system. It would also make things better for the reviewee, who could respond to all criticism targeted at him. How about Bitcoin?  This is where we'd need the distributed reputation database. But hopefully in this case you can find some other way to trust the party who is to complete his part of the deal last.  The situation with Bitcoin is comparable to p2p filesharing networks. Both can be used for legal and illegal purposes. Shutting down illegal filesharing in the p2p networks has proven very difficult technically and politically, despite the best efforts of some strong interest groups. Outlawing the whole p2p networks (even for legal files) hasn't been even seriously proposed. I don't think that legal or illegal use of Bitcoin can be successfully stopped either, at least not in the western countries. We should try to get publicity, and focus the campaign on the time right after the release to get the maximum impact: simultaneously advertising on forums, irc, Youtube, Facebook, Google Ads and other places. Slashdot with its millions of tech-savvy readers would be awesome, perhaps the best imaginable! I just hope the server can stand getting "slashdotted"  Maybe it should be upscaled beforehand just in case. I got the simplified and traditional Chinese translations of bitcoin.org front page from my friend Michael Chen. Thanks Michael!The simplified page still says "page not found" for some reason, I'm trying to make it work.For the record: the Dutch translation is by giik. Satoshi, do you think we could change the about text "Do not rely on it for actual financial transactions" for the next release? It's good to notify of the risk involved, but telling not to use it for financial transactions is not very good if we want to build an economy. Maybe it could be "for transactions of significant amount" or something like that? Yeah, I meant to say that cross-domain javascript calls are forbidden, so you can't call 127.0.0.1 from a javascript that doesn't reside in 127.0.0.1. Come to think of it, it would be quite funny if browsers allowed malicious cross-domain javascript to change people's Facebook pages etc. Here's an article about cross domain scripting: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-aj-jsonp1/It seems that direct remote calling from javascript might not be possible after all. I wonder if calling localhost:8332 is possible from pages stored on your hard disk. Oh, I didn't notice that there was already one. I removed my version. Note: Running the server/daemon on a computer that you use for Internet browsing is unsafe. A malicious page could host javascript that calls your local API and sends your coins out. I used the tagline "Say no to central banking  use Bitcoin, the revolutionary P2P currency!" in Facebook, you can take it if you want.Or should it be just "Say no to central banking  use Bitcoin!"? That's easier to read. Maybe depends on the context and text field size. Created a page on Facebook, welcome to join and invite friends! Transaction fee is needed to give an incentive to generate blocks after many years from now, when the block value has grown low. Also, if many nodes stop recording transactions into the blocks they generate (because of the small generation speed benefit gained), you can apply transaction fee as an incentive.There will probably always be nodes that include your transactions into their blocks for free, but you might have to wait for a few blocks if many nodes don't. How about Sundays, around 19-21 GMT time? Cool idea. With some additions to the Bitcoin api, your service could show the received amount for any address in the block chain and people could send their donations directly to the recipient. You can also write "bitcoin.org" on each bank note that passes through your hands   Thanks tddk! A question to everyone: from which sites would you buy ad space for the project? Freetalklive.com would be a good pick if we want to find people with ideological support to the project. Where do we find people who are interested in the idea and are also technically able to utilize it?In addition to Facebook and Google adwords, AdBrite.com is also an option. There you can choose the page you want to advertise on. You can of course use services like vekja.net or mybitcoin.com on a mobile browser, depositing money there to the extent you trust them. But maybe a mobile wallet would be better in a sense.
QR codes have been proposed as a solution here. Dwdollar, you might want to redirect http connections to Bitcoin Market to https. Now they just timeout.Great service btw.  I like the price graph. Can you make it show a continuous line instead of dots? Distributed social networks combined with a reputation system would be huge. Like eBay, LinkedIn and Facebook combined on a distributed basis. You could take something like Diaspora and build on it a reputation system where you can rate your experiences with every person or brand on earth. The value of the reviews you give would depend on your own rating and your connectedness to the social network, so you couldn't cheat by creating new accounts and writing fake reviews. You could place more value on reviews by your friends or their friends, and see how you're connected to the merchant.A system like this would be a very good incentive to be honest and not anti-social, both in business and personal life. You could instantly check the reputation of any person (maybe their credit rating hovering over their heads on your augmented vision glasses? ), and few people would like to trade or otherwise interact with people who have unsettled anti-social things on their record. Maybe some would require higher prices from those people because of the risk involved.It would be way better in maintaining peace and justice than the state-monopolized courts we have: practically free, non-violent, instantaneous and effective.What do you think about this? You still have the lack of trust problem. The one who fulfills his part of the deal first (sending the coins or the gps coordinates) needs to trust the other guy. You'd need some kind of a reputation system before sending money to an anonymous merchant. Maybe something PGP based to verify he's the same guy people have successfully traded with previously. But even that is difficult, because in this case his customers want to remain anonymous too, and anonymous recommendations are next to nothing. Economically speaking, Bitcoin is backed by the people who exchange it for other things of value (goods, services, other currencies). The same goes for every currency. The more stuff people offer in exchange, the more the currency is worth. Bitcoin supports transaction fees paid to the node that records a transaction into the block chain. If too many nodes start dropping transactions, you can pay a fee when you want to increase the likeliness of your transaction being recorded in the next block. The best way you can help is to get (web) service providers accept Bitcoin, perhaps by offering them a reward.Another way is to advertise the project at Google Ads, Facebook or popular websites to carefully chosen audiences with striking taglines, like "Credit cards are history", "End the FED, use Bitcoin" or something similar.If you only want to donate and not manage these tasks yourself, you can get me or someone else handle it for you.You can also donate to one of the BTC exchangers, so they can increase their backing for Bitcoin. For gods sake dude, fix your punctuation  Whitespace goes before a sentence and one (1) dot after a sentence. What would be the incentive to vote for the right result? Maybe the voters would be paid a reward only if they had voted the same as the majority of voters. How would you keep betters from creating their own voting-nodes? Thanks for the German translation.

I don't think they'll let you open a bank account online, the bank legislation is rather strict about customer identification.I've been considering something like Pecunix or c-gold for foreign customers, but their exchange commissions are typically around 5% for buying and selling, and they add a difficult extra step to trading.It's unfortunate that low-cost international payment methods are so scarce, but at least I'm backing up BTC so that people in Europe can trade with me, and then trade with people in the US via PayPal, hawala or whatever. Maybe I could do some trading at bitcoinmarket.com myself too.Now that we have multiple exchange services, we'll only need Bitcoin 0.3 with the daemon and it's a good time to start advertising BTC to online service providers  Yes, they're different. That's because of how the pricing adjusts to supply and demand. See the about-page for more details. Welcome to buy, sell and give feedback at www.bitcoinexchange.com, it's now open for the public  Congratulations laszlo, a great milestone reached  The JSON-RPC is not included in the current release build, so you'll need to build it yourself from the SVN (or ask someone to send you the binary for your platform). It will be included in 0.3.JSON-RPC has implementations for all the common programming languages, so that shouldn't be an issue. How about this division:General DiscussionTradeEconomy (or should this remain in general discussion?)Technical DiscussionTechnical Support (or just "Support" or "Help"?)That could also be considered. A news section with subsections "Bitcoin" and "Other". Bitcoin news could be included in the bitcoin.org front page or sidebar. I mean, if the plugin worked without a separately installed Bitcoin program.Mozilla add-ons are extensions xor plugins. Extensions have a GUI and can do stuff with javascript. A Bitcoin extension would communicate with a separate Bitcoin server through JSON requests. Plugins are coded with C++ and could perhaps run a server, but I think they're intended for showing different content types (PDF, flash, etc.) and not very well suited for other things.It would be cool if you could make transactions with direct JSON requests to other nodes of the network. That way you could code a lightweight standalone Firefox extension for Bitcoin - the lighter variant of a Bitcoin client that doesn't download the block chain. Maybe all inter-node communication could be JSON? 
A Firefox plugin would be a great product if it worked without the Bitcoin server serving the JSON requests in the background. That would require some way to make it communicate with the Bitcoin network, but I don't know if Firefox plugins can do that. Maybe if Bitcoin nodes could communicate via XML- or JSON-RPC?A good Firefox plugin would make Bitcoin a lot more attractive for the less-tech-savvy folks and perhaps more practical for everyone who handles small btc amounts.Payment links could be done without a browser plugin, using a specific URI as proposed in this thread. Irc statistics would be interesting indeed. Lately there's been around 100 users online at any time. A few months ago it was like 30. Awesome! I'll add a "Trade" page on the bitcoin.org main site, where we can list btc-accepting services. Which one would you use for buying or selling BTC internationally? Do you have experience using some of these? Any other good suggestions? PayPal etc. would be great, but they can't be used for a bigger scale exchange because of their usage policies.I'd like to hear about Link2Voip's payment method distribution if possible  Do you think we should have more forum sections here, such as trading / economy, development or something else? Or is it fine with the current division? I'm sorry Link2Voip, but I think I'll be dropping Pecunix off the list. It's way safer, easier and less expensive to store my assets in the bank. I'll send you another PM so we can sort out your transaction. Changed.Simple, lightweight, took less than a minute to install, pages saved as .txt files. Do you think MediaWiki or something else would be better? Here's a pic that hopefully helps to explain the calculation of my exchange rate. The -value of a Bitcoin transaction is the area under the exchange rate curve between points P1 and P2 on the x-axis, where P1 is my BTC reserves before the transaction, and P2 after the transaction. When you sell 10000 BTC and buy them back before someone else does, the spread (my profit margin) is always about 2%. Oh, my exchange service got publicity. Maybe I should have posted here myself before I talked about it in the IRC, to let people know what it's about.Sorry, I wasn't prepared for Pecunix transactions yet (as it reads on the page also). I'll need to get some Pecunix currency first. I'll send you a PM about your transaction.However, automated SMS purchases of Bitcoin work already. You should get your coins in a few seconds after the payment. Go ahead and try it I'll tell more about my service later, need to go now. Sirius delivers: http://bitcoin.org/wiki/I'll add a link onto the main page when we have some content. If the network grows very large and that makes it difficult to get your transaction into a block for free, you can make it happen faster by paying a small transaction fee to the node that puts your transaction into the block chain. Bitcoin supports this functionality. That's great to hear! I'm in the process of getting my exchange service up, so maybe we can co-operate in the future.  A question to Satoshi: have you tested the program with thousands of own addresses in the wallet? If I make a new address for each automated transaction, it's going to be a big amount. Or maybe I could reuse the addresses, given a big enough pool. Well, you could just install python-json-rpc (http://json-rpc.org/wiki/python-json-rpc) and do:Code:from jsonrpc import ServiceProxys = ServiceProxy("http://127.0.0.1:8332")s.getinfo()Returns a python dict. It's that easy  It's not related to our project. Apparently it's some company called Bitcoin Ltd. The page has been saying "alpha test coming soon" since the last summer at least. Can you make a another version of that with the new Bitcoin logo? I'll pay you in BC of course.  Lately I've had a lot of other things I need to work on, so it's been a delay with this project. I hope to get this done soon anyway. I decided to take the second option, I'll be working on it.The 64bit version memory leak is fixed now, so you can notice the successful Bitcoin integration on the statistics page.  I don't think using a private currency is illegal anywhere outside some banana republics. Liberty Dollar users haven't been prosecuted. As I've understood, Liberty Dollar was shut down because it could be allegedly mistaken for the US Dollar. With the current model I need to take received orders into account when calculating the price, because otherwise the customer would have an incentive to make ten orders of 1,000 btc instead of one order of 10,000btc. For example, with my pricing 1,000 btc might cost 1 but 10,000 btc would cost 11 which is more than 10 * 1.That would be like the second option but without the choice to set a min/max price. It's true that I need to emphasize that only the current spot price is shown.
You're welcome to check out and comment on the exchange service I'm building at www.bitcoinexchange.com (auth: bitcoin/bit). You can test making an order, but it won't be completed and everything might not work yet.I'm thinking about how I should solve a problem with the trade model I initially chose. That is, bitcoins or euros are reserved to the customer when he makes an order, without a guarantee that he'll really pay for it. That makes the service vulnerable to be DoS'd by some jackass who makes a buy order for all my bitcoins/euros and never pays. It also wrongly changes my pricing that automatically reacts to the amount of available bitcoins/euros I have. I have two solutions for this:1) Keep the current model, but require more personal identification from the customer (i.e. make buying more difficult), so he's less likely to just be fooling around. Require registration and e-mail confirmation. Set an expiry time and a maximum amount for transactions. The expiry time doesn't help very much in the case of payment by bank transfer, because it must be at least a few days instead of 15 minutes or so.2) Change to a stock-buying-like solution, where the customer can choose to get his coins immediately at the spot price when his payment is received, or he can set a maximum/minimum coin price at which he is willing to buy or sell. This removes the problem with reservation of coins, but is a bit more difficult for the customer. Some expiry time is also needed for paid minimum/maximum price orders that are not completed because the desired price is not reached in time. After the expiry time the order should be completed at the spot price or alternatively the payment should be returned (this causes some extra hassle).So, which option do you think sucks less? Any other solutions? It started increasing right away. I'll see if valgrind can help me. This is strange... When I start Bitcoin as a daemon on my 64 bit Linux server, it eats up all the 250MB of remaining RAM, 700MB of swap and eventually crashes. On my 32 bit Ubuntu desktop, it works fine and stays at 15MB of memory usage. The server is running a 64 bit build of Bitcoin. Maybe there's something wrong with the build or something. Thanks, these are getting to look good. A great way of advertising: Instead of shopping with a credit card, withdraw cash from an ATM and write "bitcoin.org" on each bank note that passes through your hands  Yeah, I'm planning to accept international bank transfers (free within EU), SMS payment in multiple countries, Pecunix and maybe more in the future. Now that the non-GUI and JSON-RPC are available, I might have a fully armed and operational beta of my service in a week or two  . Gtk is required by the GUI, so it must be linked if you want to use the same binary. Making a separate binary is another option, dunno how much code tweaking and ifdeffing that would take. In Ubuntu you can also switch to a non-graphical login screen by pressing ctrl + alt + F[1-8]. 82.130.33.53, should be up most of the time. Is there some hard-coded maximum limit for the amount of connections? I see 45 connections atm. It's been growing nicely in the last months. Just can't get that many coins anymore... Bitcoin is similar to gold in terms of finite supply and increasing mining costs. Every argument you can make against Bitcoin economy you can make against gold economy, but gold economy still works. Actually, gold currency has been throughout the history unmatched by any paper money in stability.It's an old keynesian argument that deflation is bad because it leads to a "deflationary spiral" where nobody eventually buys anything, because they can get more the next day. That didn't happen where gold standard was applied. Maybe some people will not buy today, but they'll buy tomorrow when the price is lower and they want to enjoy their finite lifetime. A good example is the computers market - you can get twice as good a computer with the same price if you wait a few years, but people still do buy computers today.Also, it's good to note that production cost doesn't equal value. You could start printing a currency of your own, but it's value wouldn't be equal to your printing costs. The value is zero if nobody accepts them as payment, or it can be more than the printing costs if many people accept it for payment and there's not too many notes in circulation. That's why I've found NewLibertyStandard's pricing by the production costs a bit misleading, giving the wrong picture to some people that bitcoin value is somehow bound to the electricity cost. He may of course sell and buy at whatever price he wants, but he'll be short on either bitcoins or dollars if it's not the market price (supply/demand). Exciting scenario  The men-in-black who offer a lot of money for every coin would be effectively just backing up Bitcoin and giving huge publicity to it. I wouldn't mind that. Even if they eventually managed to get 99% of all the coins and that somehow hindered the economy, we could always start using Bitcoin with a new block chain and see how long they're going to pay us. Plain text is good, but add the heading and list html tags if possible. I've been considering to exchange for LR. Now that I dig more into it, there are some scam warnings and controversy about its reliability on the net. Do you have some more information to back up your claim?How about Pecunix? It seems more reputable and better established, although the web UI is not as pretty. Pecunix has the advantage that I could hold my reserves as gold, not as euros which suffer from inflation. The transaction fee is also lower, 0,5% instead of 1%. You can send me translations of the bitcoin.org site as private messages (or if it's too long, I'll pm you my e-mail address). If you can translate only the front page, it's ok too. Everyone open your graphics editor and make a "we accept Bitcoin" logo. A good looking logo (preferably better than mine ) would be really useful.My first version attached. Do as you see fit, but personally I'd just go with bc or btc to avoid confusion. Anyways, I'm considering Liberty Reserve as one option for the exchange service I'm building. Credit card processing companies don't seem too eager to deal with an e-currency exchanger.And btw, the existing exchange services aren't run by Satoshi   Yes, the exchange of money from your bank account for Bitcoins will not be anonymous as long as your bank account isn't. That goes with any digital currency. The idea is to make Bitcoin a commonly accepted currency so that you can use them in many places instead of always needing to convert them to euros or dollars.
The connection won't get through at all if the port is not forwarded. http://btc2psc.bt.funpic.org/ Sell your Bitcoins for 10 Paysafecard codes. Welcome! Open source rocks. The coins go to the machine that the sender connects to. You need to do port forwarding to direct the incoming connections at port 8333 to the correct subnet address. Instructions: www.portforwarding.com. Not possible, the software doesn't allow that.I guess the money will just be lost in that case. http://www.livingsoulnation.org/ "LivingSoulNation.org is now using Bitcoin as its currency. Use it to trade with us or use it to donate Bitcoin(s)."Not sure what they trade, though  What is interesting is that MB closed my account when the permission request was rejected. I had previously used the account for some small transactions. I asked them for a reason, but so far they haven't replied.It's somewhat difficult to find a suitable payment gateway which supports incoming and outgoing transactions when PayPal and Moneybookers are not options. Google Checkout doesn't forbid money exchange and has a useful reputation system, but as far as I understand, they don't support sending money without the receiver being a merchant.I've noticed that mainstream payment systems (credit cards, internet services etc.) typically cost about 1-5% of the transaction + various other fees up to hundreds of dollars. Bitcoin transactions are practically free, which already makes the system superior to the existing ones, not to mention the other advantages. We could use the low transaction costs (or should we say free?) more as a selling point. Facebook marketplace seems like a good place to non-professionally sell and buy stuff for bitcoins. When you sell stuff, you're not limited to announcing the item price in a mainstream currency, you can write the price freely in a text field. When you buy stuff, you can ask people if they accept the payment in bc. Good idea, made sticky   The user gets 50 coins when he has created 1 block. The coins can be used (they "mature") when 120 blocks have been generated by the whole network after he created the block. The number of blocks of a transaction means the number of new blocks in the whole block chain after the transaction. The whole block chain grows ad infinitum. Moneybookers didn't approve of my service. Any other ideas for an international payment service? I think it was some technical limitation. Satoshi could tell more about this? Unfortunately you can't attach a message when you send to a Bitcoin address. It's possible only when sending to an IP. Sending 0 coins is also not possible.If you want to track payments, you can give a new Bitcoin address to each customer. How to make a new address: Options -> Change your address. We could perhaps make this easier by adding next to "Send Coins" a button "Receive Coins", which would create you the new address and ask for its label. I've coded a web service that enables automatic money exchange of bitcoins. Send me a PM if you want to check out the site. Now I just need 1) the command line access to Bitcoin 2) permission from Moneybookers to do money exchange (or change to another system) and 3) some testing. The reserve euros for buying coins will be from myself and hopefully some other donators, and the profit will be added to the backup capital. I'll adjust my pricing according to supply and demand so that I'll never run out of either bitcoins or euros. It's the only sensible pricing in the long run.It will be a more professional-style service than the currently existing ones. That will make it possible to market the system to people who already sell stuff. The first users will probably need to be some sort of idealists, as the immediate economic advantage of adopting bitcoin is not too big. It's ok if they just immediately traded to euros/dollars all the bitcoins they get from customers. Just that they accept bitcoins is absolutely great, as it increases the trust in the currency. We could make a "Trade" page on the bitcoin.org main site, where you can get your web shop address if you add some kind of a "we accept Bitcoins" -logo on your site.When we reach the critical mass of maybe 20-100 shops accepting Bitcoin, the growth of the Bitcoin economy might jump to a whole another level. Sounds good. Are you planning a bitcoin <-> euro/dollar service only, or are you going to enable trading other goods as well? That would be like an auction site where you trade stuff for bitcoins. Moneybookers allows currency exchange after their approval. I'll check out if there are other options anyway. Damn, that sucks. That prevents the creation of at least high-profile PayPal exchange services. I'll have to think of some other payment service that can support automation. PayPal would have been the easiest.There's certainly demand on the market for accessing your money from any computer and not having to worry about backups, and I believe web UI's will sooner or later emerge to fill that need when the number of Bitcoin users increases. Centralized access points like the web UI wouldn't threaten the whole decentralized nature of the system. You'd still have the advantages of a stable currency base and anonymous transactions. The service would not be a bank in the sense that they can't borrow the "deposited" coins to anyone, because the "depositor" may still have backups of the coins and use them at any time.On the other hand, the mobile client is also a great idea and satisfies the need for usability at any location. Backups of the wallet would be necessary though - you don't want to lose all your money when you drop your phone into the ocean or if it just gets broken. One option would be in-built FTP backups (might be too difficult for n00bs though). In addition to the semi-automatic Bitcoin<->PayPal exchange service I'm working on right now, I guess we'll also need a Bitcoin web UI to make the product a breakthrough hit. For many people it's too difficult or bothersome to install and run a node on their own computer, or maybe some don't even have a computer of their own.A web UI also makes it easier to use your coins from any location with an Internet connection. The need to make backups all the time decreases, as the server does it automatically. Of course you can also download backups of the coins onto your own computer.The service would have the advantages and disadvantages of centralization: easier access and no need to maintain the program on your own machine, but on the other hand it makes the system more vulnerable. A server storing a lot of money becomes an attractive target for hackers, so banking grade security would be required. A central server is also easier to be shut down for political reasons, so maybe backups should be maintained in different countries.Some ideas:- The coins stored on the server would be encrypted with the username and password, so if someone gets the disks, he can't read the coins easily. When setting your password, there should be a widget that shows the password strength.- For additional security you could order a list of 100 one-use keys snail mailed to your home. Each time you log in, one of these would be required, so all your money can't be stolen by just intercepting the username and password. This technique is used by some banks here. "Confirmation" would be more informative than "block". It's good if the user can relate the number of "confirmations" to the number of "blocks" in the status bar. Congratulations and welcome to the forum  The number of blocks of a transaction is the amount of new blocks that have been generated by the whole network after the transaction. Each new block in the chain means new coins to its creator. One "generated" -transaction in your transaction list means that you have generated one block. You're not the first one to find the concept of a "block" a bit confusing on the first sight.There's no confirmation of incoming transactions when someone sends to your Bitcoin address, all transactions are automatically completed. Did the transaction show up in the transaction list?Other nodes aren't going to know which IP you're sending to, your client just connects directly to it. Both IP's are fine as long as the connection routes to the right computer. Anyway, I'd use the inner address inside a network for simplicity.
