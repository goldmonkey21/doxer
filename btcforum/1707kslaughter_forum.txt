100% of per-orders will be refunded if they chose BTC.Edit: 100% of pre-orders will be refunded.  USD may take longer. We have already started sending out the first payment.  We intend to pay refunds as soon as we receive the form and can process the request.

Yes, this is just a bump in the road. We will post a refund offer after it is approved by the MSD. They will be publishing the final order and you can read for yourself. The MSD. You traded one security for another, your basis in the first security is what counts.  You did not purchase the second security you did an exchange. No, we did not sell 10,000,000 shares @ $.025, sorry. You are wrong, the language states the original purchase price.  It is what you paid in USD to acquire the shares, it is what your cost basis is in the shares plus 8%, that is what the Missouri law states and that is what the MSD is going to make us do.  The investor will have to prove what they paid with documents.  Some of the details with MSD have to be ironed out. The MSD says the investors original purchase price, so the second IPO if you tendered shares from the first IPO you will receive the first IPO price of .0005 BTC if you want a refund. If investors purchased shares (not tendered shares from the first IPO) in the second IPO, they will be getting ~$.25 per share, provided they purchased them direct from Active Mining. This is what they came up with, it is what the law in Missouri states, you get your money back plus 8%/year interest.  So, if you don't want their deal keep your shares, your choice. A long time, 15 days for our offer to get approved, if it is ok on the first revision, then 45 days for the offer, then 120 days for the payment.  I have not seen the final order yet, this is based on what I have last seen.You will be getting ~$.05 X number of shares purchased plus 8% interest from the time of your purchase on the original IPO. To be clear, it is the amount you paid for the shares in USD at the time of original purchase plus 8% interest. You don't have to take the offer and you can keep your shares in the company.
10 Million shares where not sold at .0025 BTC, the tenders shares will be valued at their original purchase price of .0005 BTC @ ~$100 USD.  The shareholder will have to prove that they purchased the shares from Active Mining not from someone else.All sharesholders wanting a refund will need to provide their ID information to the Missouri Securities Division.  The shareholders will have to transfer the shares back to Active Mining. I don't think so. The reimbursed shares will be owned by the company.The original contract applies.  It will be refunded at the original investors investment plus 8% interest in USD. That is what the MSD has told us. Working on getting the shares verified and transferred today. The refund will only be for the current price you purchased at this time, not for your previous price. This will be announced at a latter time. Active Mining will have to use non-investor funds to pay a fine of up to $100,000 this will have to come fromthe mining account only.  The balance in the mining account will used to fund operations. We are working on deals to sell the boards to larger customers, which requires less support. First of all we have never had 20,000 BTC. Next, we just build a DC with ~100 TH, that wasn't free.We also have  boards in stock and those were not free either. Not yet, we will be submitting to the court an offer. Weekly Update: 5/29/2014Sorry for the late update.  I have been busy working in our DC and taking care of our relationship with hashfast in light of their bankruptcy. Datacenter:We are having some problems keeping our AC running, this is why we have not increased the hashrate.  The project manager has now got the AC people working to correct the problem.AMC:I will finish the shares transfers as soon as I can.  I expect this to be in the next few days.VMC:We are working to build and sell boards to hashfast customers. At our DC working on increasing the hashrate on our Prospector and Gold Rush boards.  Sorry, for missing the update as I was traveling and did not have time to do it.  This customer might be us.  We also have alternate supplies of chips.  We also believe that we may be the only manufacture in a position to build boards with the alternate supply (Hashfast customers who have chips in hand, i.e Liquidbits) of chips.  I will be doing the final transfer of shares to CT just as soon as I can get set up. We are working on something else more important. Shares which were transferred to the issuer by bitfunder will be automatically transferred to CT after the AMC-TENDER shares have all be verified and transferred.  Great, The next transfer will be the final one after the 21st as most sharehold have transferred their shares.Edit:  The final transfer will include the shareholders that did not transfer their shares to AMC-TENDER and bitfunder transferred them to the issuer.  The shareholders who did not transfer their shares to AMC-TENDER should make sure that their CT email address is the same one that they used onbitfunder as that will be the email address we transfer the shares to on CT. Yes, your bitfunder username.  I will be processing transfers later tonight.Edit: Tomorrow night now. Read my update this week. The project manager managed to get a partial refund, when the PO said Non-Refundable, Non-CancelableWhich do you want Sales or Report, working on getting us a CPA and getting the taxes done.  Can't keep Customer Service Reps due to all the threats and bad language.We have enough Gold Rush to fulfill our current orders.  We have a production line up and running and tooled with parts.  The project manager has set it up to do a 5,000 board run.This is hard to do as we are always working on lowering our production cost, early boards are higher and later boards are lower.That is to be determined from our current mining revenue and current sales, we have a number of sales in the works.Here is what we are sending to customers:We are making progress with our mining operation and our sales. We going to use the funds from these to pay refunds as we lost a lot of Pre-Order bitcoins on MtGox. We expect to refund 100% of our customers.Regards,KenCustomer service~157,000 sharesNo, it has not be a high priority, getting our mining farm has been the highest priority.  We are now bring the website up to high priority.We are working on getting our own chip, this is high priority.Can't say at this point, lot of thing are happening.We expect in this datacenter to be at 120TH-150TH, which we think will be the max due to the AC required.Not at this time, we are working on sales.  We have a good solid income from the mining farm, now we what to get the fast income from sales.We have learned from a current datacenter the requirements, time, and cost required to put a datacenter together.  We are now going to focus on sales which gives us some explosive income potential.We know all about HASHFAST, we have a number of plans in the works, some of which could generate up to 2.5 Million in profitsWithout the People's ASIC team, there is noway we could be where we are today.Yes, Google AdwordsThe plan is the same, mine and saleLike, I have said in the past, we have used the same CM to build the boards, we paid the CM, we supplied the parts, we used HF supplied design to build the boards.  We currently have 200 Gold Rush PCB's in stock, another 400 in production, that we have built with a different CM waiting to be assembled.  We have a CM line tooled with parts to do a 5,000 board run as soon as the market demand dictates that we make the run.  We are working with customers that have HF chips in had to use their chips to assemble boards for them.We believe that we are in a great position with the previous production to make a profit in the near future.  Should we see that the business does not have a chance to be profitable, then yes we would liquidate.  
Sorry, I forgot, been busy doing customer support. Yes, Vince has ordered Gold Rush boards and will be doing a video. Working on creating instructions and video today. Order and select wire transfer and in the comment put that you want to pay with bitcoins.  We will then send you a bitcoin address and the amount of bitcoins to pay. What is your Order Ref number: Genius, I have already instructed the website designer to add that to our description, thank you Thanks, I be answering most of these question on Wednesday. No, I am not selling any shares and AMC/VMC is not selling any shares at the moment. Wrong. Pay With BTC  We are OEMing the chip, @jimmothy do you know what that means?  Just for you information it means that we can relabel it with our own name on it.  That is not false advertising this is done everyday.  We are in the process of updating our site as you have seen with the new products.  As soon as our new front page is up, we will be taking down the old products.  Yes, we take BTC,Order and select wire transfer and in the comment put that you want to pay with bitcoins.  We will then send you a bitcoin address and the amount of bitcoins to pay. Who cares at $849 we will sell all that we have in stock. Ok, I will fix that right now. No AMC/VMC has not purchased any shares at this point. Might be sad when you don't double your stash. I have not purchased any shares at this point. We got it under control. Next couple of days, we have racks ready to start up tomorrow, which we could not run due to the heat.  As far as the AC, that is all we have in this datacenter; however, we should be able to run this and and have income of ~$600,000 is the next year at the current price of bitcoins.  What we are expecting is that during the next year bitcoins will go up in price.   That is because of the AC, which just got fixed today.  Also, I have said that our max due to the AC is 120-150 TH.
Don't get in a rush, this is a very detailed and time consuming process.  I don't want to make a mistake and not send you enough shares or to many shares.  I think most shares will be transferred in 48-72 hours after the email is sent.   @gogxmagog Nice post.  I would love to make your pennies shine. @minerpart Sounds like a good plan, let see how it works out. YesEdit:  The $400 plan is the hard one, the other two are easy. Tell me what the bitcoin price will be in 3 months and I will tell you. First of all, I don't want to do business with bitpay because they are in bed with BFL.  Second, there are a lot of other things going on in the background that need to be taken care of, i.e datacenter, cash flow, lawyers, MSD, customer service, just to name a few. @Magzy Seems like your forgot that the refund check was mailed 3 months ago to you. I work full time, 7 days a week.  I have 1 other company, it runs itself. Our project manager is working on that solution. 750 GH/s Gold Rush Now $999 750 GH/s Gold Rush Now $999 PM the info to me if you get this error and I will email it for you. Yes No, two emails please. Weekly Update 5/7/2014We are starting the migration to Crypto-Trade.com for ActiveMining shares transferred to AMC-TENDER on BitfunderThe following limitations apply:1.

Yes, I will embrace the efforts being made by the ASKen account.Right after we made the the deal with eASIC, hashfast and cointerra came out with their 400 and 500 GH/s chips, after having eASIC run our RTL on their platform and for the minimum number of chips we had to purchase, we did not have enough pre-orders to cover the purchase due to hashfast and cointerra selling 17 Million in machines.We have been working on the datacenter to get the hash rate up.  Now, we are at the place of working on the website and this is our number 1 goal at the present time.Kind regards,ASKen[/quote] Simple, they are investigating for selling unregistered securities. For selling unregistered securities. We are already moving towards selling; however, with bitcoin being at its current prices, this has depressed sales somewhat.  We are working on a solution to get sales up. Seems you are right, anyway we are sending out refunds and we intend to offer 100% refunds  to our customers own want a refund as fast as we can.
It only covers the selling of goods by mail or telephone.(a) Mail or telephone order sales shall mean sales in which the buyer has ordered merchandise from the seller by mail or telephone, regardless of the method of payment or the method used to solicit the order.Read it yourself.http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/16/435.1 @NotLambchop Wrong again the MSD is not investigating us for securities fraud and the Wood Law firm has not said they are preparing a suit. 16 CFR Part 435 does not cover Internet Sales. @NotLambchop Lets set the record straight VMC and AMC are not being sued by anyone as of this writing. Really, I made a mistake and said 170 TH, but it should have been 100 TH by the end of April.  We are at 80% of that, it does look like the AC can only support about 130-150 TH with the third AC running.  That AC should be fixed this week.  The 800 TH was based on the power available and was my estimate.  We really did not know what the AC could support, but the DC had 3 massive AC units. Each machine was built to order, the individualized order for the type of machine and the number of cards.  We did not build a machine before we had a order for it. Look up the rule for custom orders.  This is the rule for pre-manufactured items. 24 Hour Sale on our Gold Rush boards $200 off with this voucher K0JLPCYBLimited to the first 25 boards sold. 24 Hour Sale on our Gold Rush boards $200 off with this voucher K0JLPCYBLimited to the first 25 boards sold. Weekly Update 4/30/2014AMC:Datacenter:We are continuing to add TH; however, at this point our 2 units of air conditioning are maxed out.  We have been repairing the third unit and it should be up and running next week when parts arrive.  After the third unit starts running we will be adding more THs to the datacenter.VMC:We are improving our logistics and our shipping is starting to run a lot smoother.  We have just added our Gold Rush boards to the website and at less than $2 GH these are starting to sell.MSD:No new news this week.Shares:No new news this week. What happening is that under load the voltage was going down to 115 which caused the overload.  Our electrician came over on Sunday morning and adjusted the voltage up to 130 which under load went down to 122 and solved the problem. We kicked the main 200 amp breaker.Edit:  We kicked one of our main 200 amp breakers also took down some of our switches.  When these switches went down then some of our other racks could not communicate with the internet.  We will be correcting this problem.  Your boards were shipped on Wed.  No, we have everything in place and my Project Manager has told me to expect ~170 TH by the end of the month.  It may take a week or so longer as there are only a few more days left in this month, but we do have everything is place to put THs on line quick. Not until we get shares up and trading and the MSD Investigation is settled. Yes, we are still working on it.Good question.Yes, we own a working ASIC IP.  Also, a lot of intangibles we received.  No bitcoins, or USD was paid.We are in an excellent position to do this. We are working all the time to remain competitive.  As you might have noticed our new Gold Rush board is < $2/GH retail. We are building our own boards using Hashfast design and their ASIC chip.  We have our own CM's. Weekly Update 4/23/2014.Datacenter:We are up to 64.34 Th/s and expect by the end of the month to be around ~170 TH/s.  Everything is in place to expand our hash rate to this level.VMC:We have announced our Gold Rush boards and have had a very positive response.  We are now training and switching our help to do more shipping than build of the mine.We have 100 Gold Rush boards in stock for immediate shipping.  We have worked out the logistics for this.MSD:Nothing new at this time.Shares:Nothing new at this time. Easy for you to say.  Hard to do with the bitcoin difficulty going up 15% every 10-14 days. Yes, we will be using the Gold Rush cards in our farm after we install all of our Prospector cards.  Time line has been set, 100 TH this week, then up to ~170 TH within the next month.  We have just install enough power to do this.  That is if we don't sell to many of our Gold Rush cards. The problem with the logistics is that our people have been working on our mining farm.  After the mining farm is built, then there should not be a problem. Announcing our Gold Rush mining card:In Stock ready to ship:$1,499.00 .89 Watts per GH, 750 GH/s +/- 10% PM me for orders for 10 units and over.  On our website soon for single orders.Limited availability.
@Magzy We are starting today to issue refunds including your check today.Edit:  @Magzy  In getting your check ready, we found in our records that we have already issued our check number 123 on 2/17/14 to you.  That check has not cleared our bank, so we are put a stop payment on that check and re-issuing another check to you. We are starting to issue refund checks starting today. All of our holding are held in the first two addresses above.  The first being our mining account, the second being our general funds account.  Some of the other accounts are either our coinbase accounts for converting funds to pay our bills, or our vendors accounts where we paid them in bitcoins. The shares was listed on crypto-trade before the MSD Investigation. Why don't you pay that small fine. ($100,000) for me.  By the way Havelock does not have all the proper credentials for the SEC.I know they are the shareholder shares, I have never claimed that I own the shareholders shares.You don't have to register in every state if it is a federal covered security. I think it will be sooner rather than later; however, it is somewhat controlled by the MSD Investigation.I am planning on doing the verification process sooner.  There are are number of events which are affecting the process.At the moment the MSD Investigation is controlling this.I can't at this time due to the MSD Investigation as they are reading the forum.The shares on the exchanges were being traded before the MSD Investigation.I want to get the shares trading; however, I don't want to pour gas on the MSD Investigation.  I have a number of solutions to the problem, one of which is getting the shares registered.  The problem with bitcoin exchanges are that they are not registered.  So, my thinking is CC.  CC is not an exchange, it is a way shareholders can direct trade shares with each other.  So, my thinking is if I can get the shares registered, then shareholder could use CC to trade direct and the SEC would not have a problem with that as long as the shares are registered.Thank you.[/quote] I think it will be sooner rather than later; however, it is somewhat controlled by the MSD Investigation.I am planning on doing the verification process sooner.  There are are number of events which are affecting the process.At the moment the MSD Investigation is controlling this.I can't at this time due to the MSD Investigation as they are reading the forum.The shares on the exchanges were being traded before the MSD Investigation.I want to get the shares trading; however, I don't want to pour gas on the MSD Investigation.  I have a number of solutions to the problem, one of which is getting the shares registered.  The problem with bitcoin exchanges are that they are not registered.  So, my thinking is CC.  CC is not an exchange, it is a way shareholders can direct trade shares with each other.  So, my thinking is if I can get the shares registered, then shareholder could use CC to trade direct and the SEC would not have a problem with that as long as the shares are registered.Thank you.[/quote] Yes, we are getting an accountant to working on our books, now that tax season is over.  Weekly Update 4/16/2014Datacenter is up to ~42 TH/s and we have added a 150 Kva transformer for more power.  We have ordered more equipment and racks and our next expansion will be 5 more racks at ~12.5 TH/s each bringing our total to ~100 TH/s.VMC:  We now have in stock our Gold Rush mining card which is a ~750 GH/s card, these will be available on our website soon.MSD Investigation:  I will be talking with our legal council as to what action I can take with the shares in the next few weeks.  I know everyone is ready to start trading; however, I am in a difficult position at the moment.  I am working on solutions to this problem.  Long term for shareholders, I think CC is the answer.     Most likely not, but we will start issuing them. You should be getting an answer this week from Customer Support. Yes, we will start sending out refunds this next week.  There is a queue of refunds, but we will start this week. I have ask the project manager to have the staff enter the tracking information into the shopping cart. It took awhile to get all of our logistics in place for orders.  We now have the products boxed a ready to ship.  All we need to do is put a FedEx address label on them and FedEx picks up at our warehouse at 4PM PDT every weekday.  So, shipping will be a lot faster now. We have a deal for the chips for our current production run of boards. Yes, please send it to me.  Thanks,Ken Video Of Active Mining DataCenter High Density Bitcoin Mining Racks ~15 TH/s I will be reviewing all systems that are available when they are more mature. I have thought about Havelock.  I feel that that same thing that happen to bitfunder is going to happen to Havelock.Edit:  I think either on of these is just a stop gap until CC are ready.
They have to be verified and matched to the users CT account. Yes, they are being installed now.   That is way the hash rate is going down, due to the fact that we have to shutdown some machines when we install the part. It is a class action suite and VMC is in the class. If you knew anything about law, in particular class action suites you would know that if the suit is won then the court would direct MtGox to send all the class members the information needed to recover their funds.   Soon, we have one part that was on backorder, holding us up.  We will have the part in on Friday morning. Yes, I understand about the negative feedback, we have explained in full what the problem has been with refunds.  We are getting ready to restart sending out refunds next week to customers that have requested one. Sales on the website are to our customers, not to AMC.Edit:  Most of the sales on the website are to our Pre-Order customers at this point. Yes, we have room for 30 rev 2 cards per rack (~15 TH/s per rack) and enough power to run them.  We are only going to run 4 racks in this phase ( ~60 TH/s).We are now into phase 2 of adding more electric for another 12 racks with a 150 KVA transformer. Weekly Updated 4/9/2014Datacenter:Air conditioning has been fixed and the temperature is dropping, so you should start to see an increase in hash rate as we turn on more and more machines.Data Center VideoEligius Active Mining StatisticsShares:Working on getting the verification site up this week.MSD:Lawyer is working with the division to bring this to a fast conclusion.VMC:Lot of our Pre-Order customers are taking advantage of our offer.  We expect to update our website soon and to start pushing the sales of our stock.  Our run of our Rev 3 boards has started and we expect to roll off the line 200 PCB's a week for the next 3 weeks. All of our prices are in fiat, so all refunds weather paid in fiat or btc are refunded in fiat.  Therefore, we needed to convert btc on MtGox to fiat to fund our refunds. So when we loss btc on MtGox it caused us to have to delay our refunds.  We will be starting to send out refunds next week.  We intend to refund 100% of our customers that want refunds. Not so, the bitcoins on MtGox were from our pre-order sales when bitcoins were used to pay for the order. Yes, I understand all of these dynamics.  We have a plan in place and we are executing the plan. Just waiting on the air conditioning to be fixed, so we can bring more machines on line.  The machines are just sitting there ready to be turned on.  We are also in the process of an more electric, so we can increase the hash rate even more. Getting ready to clean up the site.  Just getting some of the logistics out of the way as far as shipping and customs, before we launch our advertising. Yes, the team is getting everything ready to run.  The air conditioning parts came in today. If you would read the thread before posting you would have seen that we are waiting for the air conditioning to be fixed. To hot in the datacenter.  100+ I have explained that the delay in refunds is due to our loss of bitcoins on MtGox.  We intend to refund 100% of the money we owe to customers. No windows, but we are trying to get some air into the place, it is at 92 now. We could have more online; however, we are waiting on the air-conditioning to get fixed. Just use the hashfast version, it will be the same.  I am going to recompile it with our name, but the functions will be the same.  
We have hired an accounting firm to get these done.  With the new IRS ruling, the firm is having to look at how that affects our books.  When we release the financial reports they will be audited reports.   What he did wrong was ask for a refund before his wire transfer had cleared the bank.  This caused his refund request to be rejected as the order had not been paid.  Then, when his wire transfer cleared the bank it was not marked as accepted on his account, most likely due to his refund request above.  Now, it took another month for his payment to be accepted on his account.  Now, his refund request most likely was in limbo due to it being reject above.  Now, when that was cleared up his refund request was on the bottom of the stack.  Now, that is where it is now as we are waiting to start refunds again within the next week or so.  That being said, since he complained the the Missouri Attorney General office, we had to pull his refund from the stack and respond to the Attorney Generals office.  Therefore his refund is the very bottom of the stack.    @magzy I posted a reply in the Active Mining thread where you cross posted your complaint. @magzy What I am saying is that we lost BTC on MtGox that we needed to convert to USD to give you a refund.  The first mistake you made was you ask for a refund before your wire transfer cleared, this is where the problem begun.  Since you was asking for a refund and your payment had not been accepted, then your refund was not accepted, then your payment was not marked as accepted for a month after that.I will be happy to refund your money as soon as we start refunds, which should be next week when my customer service rep comes back to work.  We intend to refund 100% of our customers that want a refund, we have already started shipping to our Pre-Order customers that wanted our Prospector card and we offered them a 20% discount and we applied their Pre-Order funds to their new order.  You seem to be the only customer having a problem like this, so I think it was due to asking for a refund on the day you placed the order and not waiting until your wire transfer cleared the bank. @Magzy  We are getting ready to start refunding customers this coming week as soon as our new customer service rep is back on the job.  You can do what you need to do, these are custom made products which in the description says that it may take 3 months or more to receive your product.  We have refunded over $300,000 so we are not trying to steal your money.  However, we did lose pre-order money on MtGox, which has caused us a delay in refunding customers. There are a number of factors which limits how fast we can increase our self mining hash rate.  1) Available power, we have to install step down transformers, power panels and outlets in each rack.  2) Available funds for mining boards, power supplies, coolers, cables, etc.  3)  The amount of time it takes to install a working miner in the rack.  4) The amount of time it takes to tweak the miners for maximum performance.  5)  Maximum available power and cooling, we believe using our calculations we have enough power and cooling for 1,069 TH based on the electrician's estimate.      The AC should be running late next week, they are waiting on parts.  I will start working on the verification program on Monday, moving it up to the server and testing it out. Data Center Update: 4/5/2014We are continuing to bring up machines in our data center; however, we won't have the air conditioning running until next week, so this may limit us to the number of TH we can put on line this week.Shipping of products:Due to bring the Data Center online on Thursday and Friday we did not ship any products.  We will continue shipping starting on Monday the 7th. Yes, the next revision has a mini-usb port. Yes, I will be working with our CPA next week to get our books in order and pay any taxes that are due. Due to our system using MtGox prestashop pluggin, we are not processing BTC at the moment. We will be using a CPA to do our taxes and we will be paying what we owe to our Uncle Sam. I will be fixing that next week. The bitcoin price. Because, I am out west bring up our datacenter.   I purchased the Avalons with my own bitcoins. Yes, it was my fault that I did not include the cable.  However, I was trying to ship it fast, my bad.
Weekly Update 4/2/2014Pre-Order Customers:We are offering 20% off the price of our Prospector card for our Pre-Order customers.  We will apply your pre-order payment to your total Prospector card order.  You will need to use this voucher code URZSZLUF and have a valid pre-order with us.  Should your pre-order amount not cover the total on your order you will need to pay the difference.  If there is a balance left we will issue you a voucher for a future purchase.  When ordering as a pre-order customer you will need to add the Order ID of the pre-order you want transferred in the comment section of the order.Datacenter:The datacenter should be coming on line this week, barring any unforeseen problems.  We will be bring up 1 rack at a time.  We will have 4 racks in this phase with ~60 TH/s coming on line.  We will be adding additional step-down transformers to bring the total up to 100 TH/s after we get the first phase running.  The next phase will be to bring the datacenter up to 200 TH/s after the first month of running the first phase.MSD Investigation:We are continuing to work with the MSD through our lawyer to bring this to a conclusion is the shortest amount of time as possible.Sells:We have shipped our first miners and they have been delivered.  We are continuing to get orders and we are continuing to ship miners.Shares:Next week I will start transferring shares to CT so our investors can start trading. We manufactured these boards, we purchased the the parts, we purchased the PCB, and we paid the CM to assemble the boards.We have 3 different CM's working on this project at the current time.  One of which is the same CM Hashfast uses. Yes, this is the board that we are building 5,000 in April. If you pick up the product you will have to pay sales tax. 6.75% in Missouri. Yes, we have a reserved a number of boards for our Pre-Order customers.  We will ship those out this week.  We will be offering all our pre-order customers a 20% discount off of our $1,999 price which is $1,599.  Pre-Order customer can use their previous order payment and apply it to the Prospector boards. Electricians are working on it now.  Hope to be up and running on Friday. The stock is not in Springfield; however, we do now have a sale tax license, but we don't have a retail business license, so nowe can't sale any out the door.   We are sending the card today Fedex Overnight 3PM delivery. ThanksEdit:  Are there any reddit users here that can list this on http://www.reddit.com/r/BitMarket FAST-HASH ONE PROSPECTOR SPECIAL$1,499 On the first unit ordered, Limit of 5 orders per customer.24 Hour Special on our Fast-Hash One Prospector using this voucher code: Q3W984BMLimited To The First 50 units Sold. FAST-HASH ONE PROSPECTOR SPECIAL$1,499 On the first unit ordered, Limit of 5 orders per customer.24 Hour Special on our Fast-Hash One Prospector using this voucher code: Q3W984BMLimited To The First 50 units Sold. The pictures show our stock of boards and the product ready to be shipped. When we say we are tooling our own production line, this is at a contract manufacturing company.   This is how it works in the bitcoin mining industry if you want to sell chips.  That is what a lot of companies have done before hashfast. i.e. Avalon. We are building our own boards using hashfast's reference design which we have licensed.  We are tooling our own production line, producing the PCB, buying the parts for the board, and having them assembled.  We did not buy boards from hashfast, we had our own boards manufactured using hashfast reference design.  So, we did not take any boards away from hashfast's pre-order customers.  No, these boards were manufactured by us, using the reference design by hashfast.  This is standard procedure in the semiconductor business, AMD had done this for years. Of course it is, this is our development board from hashfast.  We are in the process of tooling our production line to build 5,000 boards in April.  We manufactured the boards using their design.
This week Yes, I agree. Setting up the datacenter for 180 boards @ ~512 GH/s = 92,160 GH/s or ~92 TH/s, if sales are good on our Prospector boards and it takes a little longer to get our power in our datacenter up and running we may use the first Gold Rush boards in the datacenter.   I have always been honest with my shareholders; however, there are times to release information and there are times to hold back information.  It has taken some time to move from a pre-order product to an In Stock product. Project Manager is meeting with the Electrician as we speak.  As soon as we get the power in the datacenter up and running.  We are working on getting all the miners ready this week to go online as soon as we have  the power set up. Don't care whether they sell or not, we will just mine with them.Edit:  We are in excellent financial position, that is why we are able to tool up a 5,000 board production line. The difference is that we have In Stock products ready to ship.  Also, we have products for our mining farm. Yes, and we are still working on developing our own 28nm chip. It has been a real learning process, I have to give all the credit to my Project Manager. NoBut we have them in stock ready to ship. The Prospector is not the Yoli Evo board.  We will be releasing our Gold Rush board next month using the Yoli Evo design.  We are tooling up our production line to produce 5,000 of these next month. Yes It is a chip that we purchased in bulk and we are reselling in on our manufactured boards as our Fast-Hash One chip. This is a development board.  We are tooling our production line to manufacture 5,000 boards in April. An order was canceled adding back the inventory into stock. No, we purchased chips from hashfast and manufactured our own boards.  We are tooling up our own line to manufacture 5,000 boards in April, and we may sell some of our boards to hashfast. Images of products and of our Datacenter being build Images of products and of our Datacenter being build Images of products and of our Datacenter being build My project manager has a picture and we will be posting as soon as we can.
The Avalons and Klondike's are still on BTCGuild.  We will have taken pictures and will post them soon. I will do that. We are waiting on payment in BTC on 95 cards.  Should the customer not pay within 24 hours the stock will be added back to our in stock quantity. Yes, I know, but BitPay is a little to close to BFL for me.  I now have a lot of experience with Prestashop plugins so I may write my own. This will all be sorted out in the near future.  I am very committed to all of my trusting and patient investors.  What we are doing right now will raise shareholder value very quick.   I have never been a Scammer, we have had delays in producing our product, but we have processed over $300,000 in refunds to customers, Scammers don't do refunds.  We are very busy getting these ready to ship and at the same time we are very busy getting our datacenter up and running. Yes, I am going to use Coinbase.  I need a prestashop plugin, do they have one? Yes, we only have Wire Transfers on our site at the moment as our bitcoin processor before was MtGox.  We can still take bitcoins, but we will process them manual.  Send us a message if you want to order with bitcoins. Adding 100 more cards for sale from our mining farm due to the delay in getting our step down transformers installed.  We will be adding back these 100 cards from our next production run in 2 weeks.  The new cards will be our revision 3 cards which will be faster. Adding 100 more cards for sale from our mining farm due to the delay in getting our step down transformers installed.  We will be adding back these 100 cards from our next production run in 2 weeks.  The new cards will be our revision 3 cards which will be faster. Fast-Hash One Prospector (In Stock) Fast-Hash One Prospector (In Stock) Our system in the US is 240/120 It is just a power and air conditioning limit.Edit:  When we get close to that limit, we could bring in more power and air conditioning. As of today we have the 100TH in hand; however, we are working on getting the 480 3 phase power stepped down to 240/120.  The miners take a lot of power in a small space.  As soon as we get the power step down equipment installed and running the miners you will start to see the hash rate increase in our Eligius mining account address.Yes, we might do this.  I will be looking at this as soon as we get the mining up and running.We are still working on development of our own chip. No, the Avalons were purchased with my personal BTC. The Eligius hash power was from a Demo/Development board.  This hashing power is subject to removal at any time to do a Demo or to do Development work.  We are using the board at the present time to help us bringing up our 100 TH along with the boards power supply which has to be modified. Weekly Update 3/26/2014AMC Mining:We have completed the signing of our lease for our ~3,700 sq feet datacenter.  The datacenter has 2 480 Volt 250 amp 3 phase power supplies, plus a backup generator which supplies the same amount, the air conditioning has it own power supply.  we are in the process of bringing this datacenter online with ~100 TH of mining equipment.  We also expect to increase to 200 TH within 4 weeks after bringing up the first 100 TH.  The datacenters power and air conditioning can easily support up to 800 TH of mining equipment.  We are planning on adding 100 TH per month until we reach the maximum above.Shares:We want to get share trading up and running on Colored Coins as soon as it is safe and legal to do so. VMC:VMC will be issuing a press release in the near future.  Yes, but the 100 TH we are bringing on line for AMC, plus an additional 100 TH in the next few weeks will be profitable. The Avalons have been mining over 9 months for the mining company.
Wrong, VMC did not loose all of it funds; however, the MtGox losses reduced our cash postion to a place where we had to delay refunds.  Those refunds will be paid out from VMC funds not AMC funds. We have sent refunds of over $300,000; however, we have had to delay refunds due to our losses on MtGox.  With our parent company Active Mining we are still in a position to refund 100% of our Pre-Orders.  However, VMC would like to pay the refunds from its funds. ... We are expecting to start sending our refunds in coming week.  You should ask for a refund in our shopping cart if you have not already... Yes, we are using 28nm chips in our new boards. I said it was a prototype board.  Prototype board are not production quality.  We are tweaking this board for the best speed possible.  We will apply the tweaks to our production quality boards which will be coming off the production line this week.  We expect that this version of our production boards will run @ ~600 GH/s.   That is what you should see, this is our first prototype board off of the line.  We are building more. Why don't you just do this, look at the old miners on BTCGuild and the new miner on eligius.   Development board running here:Early Prototype Development Board I responded to your PM. @zumzero First, I want to thank you for your support this last year, it has really been a learning experence for me.There are a number of reasons for not spilling the beans.  Here they are MSD, Competition, and Trolls just to name a few.  However, me and my team are working hard out west to make it happen.  The shareholders will soon see proof of what we are doing in the form of increased bitcoins flowing into our mining address.  So, just stay tuned to this channel and watch the mining address.  Screenshots will help, our system will automatically verify your shares if you know your bitfunder username, and transaction information for  shares transferred to AMC-TENDER.  I am sorry you can't understand a simple statement, I will make it clear, with 100 TH to 200 TH of hashing power we will be converting to solo mining over time.  I believe that I said in my announcement that we would be adding more THs in the future. Ok, again very simple, moved some from Gox, had a hard time, but finally got some out.  I was planning on getting all of them all out, but got very busy on making the 55nm deal. Again very simple, we were using MtGox to process our bitcoin transactions from Pre-Orders. It is very simple, when VMC got low on cash for refunds, they would have transferred bitcoins from MtGox to Coinbase and sold them.  However, when the coins were lost at MtGox it was kinda hard to transfer them to Coinbase to sell.  See how that works, very simple. That is the plan. Did I say anywhere we are going to hide the hash rate.  We have always been transparent with our mining revenue and we will continue to do that in the future. As you know we have two corporation here AMC and VMC, VMC lost some coins it had in MtGox from Pre-Orders, this caused VMC to have a minor cash crunch for refunds the last few weeks.  AMC has enough coins to loan VMC to provide for refunds; however, I prefer to have VMC pay the refunds from its profits on running AMC mining farm, building machines for AMC, and from VMC sales of miners.  VMC is still in a cash positive state and will start refunding Pre-Orders next week again.  AMC/VMC has enough cash to cover over 6X the amount of our current Pre-Orders.  Also, VMC is getting ready to start selling in stock bitcoin mining cards.  We will be converting to Solo Mining with this much hashing. We are currently running one of our Demo boards on BTCGuild and our total hashing rate is:Team AMC: 211435   926.93 GH/s
It is our Fast-Hash One 600 GH/s board, soon to be on our website.I would not call it a 'stop-gap' solution.  We are doing what is required in the business to make the company and our shareholders successful.  There are a number of strategies we are using to make this happen.   We are getting ready to start issuing refunds again.  We are also using our new 600 GH/s board as we get them in full production to solve our refund problem.My lawyer has just responded to the MSD with the information they requested.  I think that due to the couterparty risk with these bitcoin exchanges, that we will be using colored coins.  CC is getting very close to being usable.  I do want to get everyone where they can trade; however, I need to consult with my lawyer before doing anything. Weekly Update 3/19/2014Here is the good news for March, we are rolling off the production line ~100 TH/s of mining gear which will be installed in our soon to be leased data-center.  We are expecting to have the 100 TH/s up and running on our BTCGuild account in the next 2 weeks, so everyone will be able to see the new hashing power.  We will then convert to sole mining over the next month.  After the first 100 TH/s is on line we will be increasing our hashing power on a regular basis.  We are expecting the next increase in hashing power to be ~100 TH/s within a month for a total of ~200 TH/s.Active Mining PR Staff We don't issue "Bad Checks" not one of our refund checks have been returned. CS can fix that for you. Have you talked to our CS.  We can fix this for you. Please use the shopping cart message system to contact us. We have replaced VMC's customer service staff with Kris.  Kris is going through all of the refunds and we expect to start sending refunds out again in the next 2-4 weeks.  This delay in refunds was due to our loss of bitcoins on MtGox; however, we will be covering all refunds 100%. Weekly Update 3/12/2014VMC has hired Kris as their new customer service rep and she is getting all of the old messages caught up.VMC is expecting to start sending out refund check again in about 2-4 weeks.  This delay in refund checkswas caused by VMC's loss of bitcoins on MtGox.  All refunds will be covered 100%.I will be in California this next week and I am expecting to announce some really good news next week.Active Mining PR - Staff Well written, so do I have what it takes you ask, well ask again in about 14 days. I think Colored Coins is the answer. I need to check with my lawyer before doing this.Check the Active Mining threads for the address.Had a meeting with our lawyer yesterday, does not sound like it will cause VMC or AMC to much trouble.I will be announcing this in the near future.OkI wish I could, this is a moving target at the moment I am using Armory with an offline wallet.  In addition, I created a program that keeps SHA256 ASIC from breaking the key.  I also have the keys stored in a paper wallet in a fire safe in 2 locations. I am using Armory with an off-line wallet. Active Mining did not get 25,000 BTC from our IPO.  The first IPO was at .0005 BTC and a lot of those sharesholders tendered their shares for Active Mining shares. This is not going to happen to VMC. I would not expect a full refund from eASIC; however, as I have said we have a plan, which with a partial refund from eASIC we could recoup eASIC's NRE.  We are continuing to work with our vendors on our 28nm project.Not at this time.  We are doing Weekly updates to keep shareholders up to date.Remember Active Mining has paid out or is going to pay out $ 462,115.81  in dividends.  So, Active Mining has gave a lot of money back. Most likely Coinbase. We only had bitcoins on MtGox no USD. Yes, all of our bitcoin's are in a cold wallet.
I am just talking about the entities not about profit or loss. The ukyo shares were being traded before the MSD investigation. We were using MtGox to process our bitcoin transactions. Weekly Update 3/5/2014Active Mining Corporation (Belize) is holding shares for  investors, pending the MSD investigation and colored coins. VMC's 453 BTC from Pre-Orders.  No Active Mining BTC was lost.Less than $1,000 plus Active Mining shares.  At the same time we gained a lot of experience and the help of 2 engineers.  I think in the long run it will be a net positive. The 55nm was taped out on a shuttle run.  Production run was not taped out.~1500 BTCThis has not be finalized as of this date.  We are working this week a plans which will recover the complete eASIC NRE.We don't release the names of who is on the payroll and we don't release the names of our vendors. The tapeout was the shuttle run for prototypes.  This was cancelled and transferred to a production run, which was then cancelled also. Not any more than what has been explained before.Active Mining - No Virtual Mining - Yes I have no problem with that; however, I don't think it is necessary as we will be releasing financials for last year by the end of the month.  I ask for your Order Id on February 5th:With no response, I then ask for your Order Ref number on February 27, after over 24 hours waiting with no response and no Order Ref number and then after two request it was determined that you were a troll with no order in our system, so I deleted your post.  Not until the post was deleted did you send me your Order Id. It was the right decision base on all of the facts.We are in great shape and moving forwared.It is related to a 28nm full custom chip.  As soon as I can.  Still working on some of the details.I am sorry that the 55nm news came from the media; however, I was waiting to announce that with the good news. Yes I will get it today. Except we aren't in a dire mess. I don't think so.  we have sent out refunds last week.  @magzy, I can't seem to find in any of you PM's an Order ID, so I don't even know if you have an order.  I seen your info to CS and I have now PMed you to get your Order ID.  We would have sent your refund last week if your order could have been confirmed. Virtual Mining Corporation 02/27/14 Virtual Mining is currently processing and confirming pre-order refund requests. It is a very timely process because we are in the final stages of configuration before all of our pre-orders are shipped. Look to your email for product shipping order schedule. At the current time we are not immediately moving every order to a refund status due to our final staging and rigging our products for shipping. We are contacting all of our valued customers with pre-orders  with our new product specification details that includes an increase in hashing power.  This increase in hashing power will make up for our delay in shipping.  Should any of our customers still wish to receive a refund even with the increase in hashing power please contact our customer service department. Thank you for your continued patience and good luck on your Mining Ventures  Virtual Mining Corporation 02/27/14 Virtual Mining is currently processing and confirming pre-order refund requests.

Weekly Update 2/26/2014We have hired a really good lawyer for the MSD problem.  I am out west working with our Project Manager working with our vendors to move our projects into high gear.  Expect good news in March.  Active Mining Staff I will try. No, I don't at the present time. No bitcoins on CT. We have processed refunds this week and mailed out checks.  With the volume of refunds being processed, we are running behind. Our project manager and engineers have worked to get a chip that can be air cooled, this will work in our expansion cases.  The project manager with our engineers has managed to reduce the cost of the expansion cases to about 25% of what the cost was.  This will be changed on our website soon.
We don't release vendor information anymore.  i.e. VE bugging eASIC. We are expecting to recover most of the eASIC NRE. Wrong, try again. Weekly Update 2/19/2014We have started with a new vendor for our 28nm project.  Our custom 28nm will be very competitive in the market place and will be air cooled and use a double slot.  The estimate speed of the new card will be 432 GH/s and will be listed at $1499.00.Management is preparing for the MSD investigation, management believes that the MSD will clear VMC of any wrong acts in Missouri as VMC has NOT offered ActiveMining shares.  Management believes that the company can be successful in the long run.  The management team is committed to seeing this through.ActiveMining-PR Staff  Yes, the old thread is locked and I will be posting here. Why don't you try it.  It is better than your "Blackmailing Business". I wonder how godaddy pays for those "Super Bowl Ads".  Hint: Maybe their massive web hosting business. No, it would have to be a redesign, but not much of one. This is a board that our engineer designed and those are BFL Bitfury chips.  He will be designing a reference board for our DIY for our 55nm and 28nm chips like this one. We will be providing one soon.Edit:  It will be listed in our shopping cart when available. I sent an email to have the CS staff check it out tomorrow. I will have customer service check this out. We are changing our Nextream-3 28nm chip to a full custom 28nm chip.These are our own designed 55nm chips. Have you checked our on-line shopping cart, it shows we did a refund on 1-15-14.  I see you have two address, have you check both of those address for the check? I have been talking with gjpminingco about using his services for a couple of projects. We have paid out over $200,000 in refunds. Pre-Order 55nm Chips Shipping April 17,2014 Pre-Order 55nm Chips Shipping April 17,2014 I won't have an answer to that question until I meet with my securities lawyer. We are working with our vendors to use any of the funds we may have paid them on our new 28nm project, our vendors seem to want to work with us and meet our other vendors prices.  The project manager has been meeting with them last week and will be meeting with them again this week to get a quote.  We want to get started on the 28nm ASAP.I don't have any documentation on the tapeout.  This was for the shuttle run and prototypes which we have canceled and have now changed to the production run.  See my weekly update for the wafer delivery dates.
I am hoping to work on it more between now and April.  I have been busy on the 55nm deal. eASIC does not put up a press release until there is a deal which has to be paid so, there is your proof that we paid eASIC. Active Mining Corporation is a Belize company, I doubt Missouri has any jurisdiction.  I can't say at this time, as we just got the letter.  I have not talked with a Missouri securities lawyer as I am being referred to one at this time by my general business lawyer.1.9 GH/s per die and one die per package. Our engineers have calculated 170,000 chips per lot of 25 wafers.We are still working with eASIC, we are getting multiple quotes on our Full Custom 28nm project.  Weekly Update 2/12/2014On the 55nm project:This week has had a number of developments, our project manager is working on wrapping up all the detail of our 55nm project.  We are expecting to receive our first 55nm wafers on April 10th, with next batch due on April 29th, May 5th and May 8th for a total of ~104 wafers.  It will take 1-2 weeks to have the chips packaged and then shipped to our board manufacturers.  We will be selling and mining with these chips and boards, depending on what makes the most since at the time.  The tape-out was done on Peoples ASIC account for a shuttle run of 50 prototype chips, we have canceled the shuttle run and changed to a full production run of the chips on VMC own account.  Peoples ASIC IP has been signed over to VMC and the FAB has all the legal paper work to start VMC's production run of wafers.On the 28nm project:We are getting quotes from a number of vendors including eASIC.  After the project is started we expect it to be completed in 8 weeks, after which we will tape-out.On Crypto-Trade:I am hoping to get shareholders shares transferred ASAP and get full trading up and running.  We have received a letter from the Missouri Securities Division asking for information on Active Mining Corportation, at this point we have ask for more time to respond and have seeked legal advice.Active-Mining PR I am selling Ukyo shares to get Active Mining BTC back that he owes us.  The problem with keeping the shares is that Ukyo may do some legal like declaring bankruptcy to keep us from selling the shares in the future or claiming the dividends from the shares.  This has nothing to do with our needing BTC, or that we don't have faith in the company.  We are in an excellent financial position. I would make the decision; however, taking in to account all the factors including the engineering teams input.  I wouldn't worry to much about the 20nm, as all I said was that we were looking into it.  Sure, we are just looking into it.  We would only go to that if it makes since, which means GH/s, Power, and time to market.  With time to market being the most important.  Yes, I will try to do that, but sometime when we are working on deals I forget.  I been thinking about a professional PR person; however, it is not on the top of my list of things to do.  As far as eASIC, they are working with us to get the most out of our 28nm custom chip. KnC is using 4 dies in one package, so our chip is very close to what they have done.  Our chip with 4 dies would be 120 GH/s.  We are working on increasing the number of cores. Weekly Update 2/5/2014This last week has been very busy with our Project manager and engineers working with eASIC on our 28nm custom chip.  We have receive the first results back and the chip is expected to run at 30 GH/s, we are working on improving this number.  Also, we have received the quote on our PCIe board and our project manager and engineers are meeting with eASIC and our board engineers this week to keep our project on track.  We are also meeting with UMC to finalize our account setup.  We are also thinking about going to a 20nm custom chip and skipping the 28nm, if we can get it produced fast enough.We will do a combination of sales and mining; however, it seems that mining in a place where the cost are low will give us the best return.An estimate of all of the cost.With this amount of hashing we will be solo mining.  No we don't have it setup at this time.We will start getting our chips in the middle of April, so the deployment would be from April to June.  I think the May projection is realistic, as I think the mining.thegenesisblock.com is about a month to conservitive.We have added to the chip cost an estimate for all the cost above.  As we get closer to the April rollout we will have a better idea of the total cost and we will provide an update on those cost.At this time, we don't have a projection on the boards power; however, the chips consume >98% of the power.Well, I think the projection is realistic, bitcoin went up 61X last year and I am only giving it a 10% per month raise.  Go ahead and run your own projections.Working as fast as I can on Crypto-Trade verification, we have a lot of moving parts in our business which is taking a lot of my time, but I do want to get all shareholders shares verified and moved to CT ASAP. Virtual Mining is a manufacture of Bitcoin Mining Machines,  Active Mining Corporation (Belize) is the company that has issued AMC on Crypto-Trade. Virtual Mining has nothing to do with the shares. No, I am not willfully withholding shareholder access to their shares to have unimpeded access to the market.  I am liquidating the shares due to the above reasons. You made the point that Ukyo could declare bankruptcy.  This is why we have to have a fire sale at this time.  Should Ukyo declare bankruptcy, the court would put a stay on selling any of his assets, and Active Mining would be stuck until the court confirmed that our lien on the shares comes before other debtors.  So, this is the reason for putting up the shares at this time ahead of other shareholders being allowed to trade. If we have the shares and he sues, the court could keep us from selling the shares.  This way if he sues I have the 100 BTC to pay our legal fees.  If he sues, we would definitely counter sue for our 100 BTC that he owes us.  Since our chances to prevail on our counter suite would be very high, I think the chances of him suing us is very low.  Also, It takes cash to sue someone, and I don't think he has any, so he says. You are not taking into account that Ukyo may do something legally to keep us from recovering our BTC.  So, that is why we are having a fire sale on these shares. Just want to recover Active Mining BTC, while we can.  These are a bargain and should go very quick.  To recover the 100 BTC owed to Active Mining plus cost.  Ukyo had 10 days to pay Active Mining the 100 BTC plus cost and he has failed to pay that.  So, we are selling his shares to pay his debt. Profit Projections On Our 55nm Deployment @EskimoBob When I said  "to get the 55nm chip" it was not to go there a put a 55nm chip in my hand.  It was to negotiate a deal to buy the assets of a start up company.  You need to do that face to face.
Yes, I have been working on it for awhile; however, the trip to the west coast to get the 55nm chip, working with eASIC to change to a custom 28nm chip, getting us on the February run at UMC so that we could have chips in mid april has been my priority this month.    Yes, I will be working on this the next few days.  I don't see to many problems getting it running ASAP. We can't send emails to shareholders as we don't have all shareholders emails from Bitfunder.  We will make an announcement and shareholders will enter their email address in the verification program.  See my previous post on the procedure.   There is no need to PM me your information, the verification program on the server is where you will need to enter your information, this way the program can verify your shares.  After the program verifies your shares, we will send a list of verified shareholders to CT, where they will create the account if not already created and add the verified number of shares to the account. At this point we expect to have 24 55nm chips per PCIe board.  The engineers are working on the design and helping with the sourcing.  We expect to have the boards available when the first chips arrive in April. @PurpleTentacle I think all of Bitfunder transaction where on Central time.  PM me your bitfunder username, transaction time and number of shares from your records and I will look it up in our transaction records to see if they match.  If you have more that one transfer just send one.  I will never redirect any profits away from Active Mining shareholders for any reason.  I want all of my shareholders that have backed Active Mining to reap the benefits of their investment. Your shares will be transferred after the AMC-TENDER shares are transferred. The date and time in your Bitfunder transfer log. We are still going to be making that gear; however, I will be changing the available dates on the 28nm products today or tomorrow. As soon as I get the verification program up on the server, then as investors get verified we will start sending the list over to CT to create the accounts which will include the shares.  So, once the accounts are created then trading will start.  Thanks, I meant to mention that if you made more that one transfer to AMC-TENDER, each will have to be verified.  Yes, everything is coming together.  Our project manager is keeping everyone working together and the project moving forward. Sure, you will need the email address you want to use on CT, if you have an account already the shares will just be added to that account, if you don't then an account on that email will be created and the shares added to that account.  Next you will need the date and time of your transfer to AMC-TENDER and the Number of shares tendered.  To be verified the data must match our transfer records from bitfunder. Yes, I just have to set it up on the server. Update on trading and wafers:It is going to be a few more days before, I can get the verifying program uploaded to the server.I have been busy getting on the February UMC production run for our 55nm chip.We are going to get 6 Wafer in the middle of April with about 1 week to package the chips.  Based on our estimated yield of 6,800 chips per wafer this give us 40,800 chips for a total hash rate of  77.52 TH/s.  Next we are going to receive 19 wafers by the end of April for a total of 245.48 TH/s, giving us 323 TH/s.  In May we will be able to get all of the wafers we want to run. We will start the process of verifying the shares tomorrow. Weekly Update 1/29/14We now have a team of engineers and a project manager working with eASIC and our other vendors to get this project completed as soon as posible.  We are expecting to add 1 to 2 Petahashs of mining in Q2.NoWe have changed the 28nm to a full custom to be more competitive.  We now have a full team, engineer and project manager working on pushing the 28nm project as fast as we can.We will have the board ready when we have the 55nm chips, the design will be used on the 28nm chips also.We shipped some accessories products to India. No, the timeline was not too optimistic and there was not a catastrophic failure.  In September with bitcoins @ 140, with competition with 400 GH/s and 500 GH/s chips our machines would not ROI, so a decision was made that we would have to refund all of our pre-orders, so we did not commit a lot of our funds to building boards, we was also trying to get enough pre-orders to make our minimum lot with eASIC. We now have a competed design, so we are not in the design phase now.  Finding the right engineers, transferring shares from BTC-TC, legal problems with the Bitfunder shutdown, making sure that when we spun up our chip it would work, fighting all the FUD on bitcointalk, etc.We have the funds to refund 100% of our pre-orders.Pre-Orders in fiat are keep in fiat at the moment.No,  CEX.IODecemberYes, we expect the 55nm chips in Q2, 28nm in Q3.  Our RTL is complete. No, but due to competitive reasons we had to move to a full custom 28nm No, Intellihash did require some code to be added, but there were other reasons also that required some code to be written.We no long release the name of our vendors, due to some investors and customers bugging them.  We hired them in December and it took a couple of weeks.  We had to learn some lessons from the first engineers we hired. No, that would be under NDA with eASIC and NDA with the engineers.ActiveMining-PR Staff The trolls are scared of what Active Mining will be able to achieve. You left out one very important detail above.  You received a 100% refund of your money.
@UkyoI will explain it to you, a corporation has a lien on its shares for any sums owed by a shareholder, so we have a lien on your shares.  You are the owner of Bitfunder and the funds where on Bitfunder.  Because they where transferred to WeEx in a contract that you had with them does not relieve you of your obligation to pay us our funds.  Also, 38 BTC was left on Bitfunder and I have screenshots of it being there.  I did not authorize it to be transferred to WeEx.

We just want the BTC that is owed us plus any legal fees and cost.  Active Mining has a lien on the shares per Corporation law. CORPORATE AND COMPENSATION LAWS We are selling Ukyo shares on Crypto-Trade to recover our losses on Bitfunder.We will start moving Investors shares to Crypto-Trade within the next 7 days. How about 0.017 $/kWh   2.5W per chip or 1.315789474W/GHEdit: 2.5 Watts per GH/s Not quite, the 55 nm is a full custom chip. As of now you would have to make a choice.  Now, that said it the Bitcoin world it is hard to see 1 day ahead.  So, if you want to take a chance on CT and later and we have the man power and systems in place where we could move the shares from CT to CC then we would.  Of course if you are on CT something like what happen to Bitfunder could happen and we would have to move the shares to CC. Good info, just getting ready to do this myself. We will know soon. Very good. Take this into account, a lot more customers have $1,000 or $2,000 for a machine than $10,000 for a machine. We will have to use CT and CS now. No, Intellihash will be a bonus. Not very much.  We now have 2 Engineers in San Jose and a Project Manager working very closely with eASIC to make sure the project is completed the the shortest time possible.  The chips have not been produced at this time.  We have just taped-out, so this is the start of the manufacturing process. This is not a partnership, we own 100% of the IP. The 55 nm is owned by Active Mining, so this is not a partnership; however, the two engineers are on our team. That is the 28 nm chips, we have a 10.488 TH/s unit with the 55 nm chips.  We will also have bulk sales of our 55 nm chip soon.
We do both, we sale hardware and we mine.   We can't dilute the shares.  There are only 10,000,000 shares outstanding and those only receive dividends. Yes, we purchased the IP which we will also use in our custom 28 nm.  UMC is the FAB for the 55 nm.11mm x 11m package, 1.9 GH/s, 2.5 Watts. 11mm X 11m package, 1.9 GH/s and 2.5 watts. No, it will be a full custom just like the other ASIC manufactures. Weekly Update 1/21/14Edit: Getting trading up and running is now my number one mission. PRESS RELEASESpringfield, MO and Santa Jose, CA  January 21, 2014  Active Mining Corporation (Belize) (AMC) a bitcoin Mining and Hardware Manufacture, and  People's ASIC a stealth Silicon Valley startup founded by two veteran engineers is proud to announce today the tape-out of their 55 nm UMC Bitcoin Mining ASIC.  The ASIC features SHA256 optimizations according to a scientific paper by Dadda et al.Simultaneously, AMC has acquired the Intellectual Property (Verilog code, test bench, GDS-II data, etc. for the 55nm UMC Bitcoin Mining ASIC.  Delivery of chips is expected in Q2/2014.  Also, AMC will use the same design team and code which successfully taped out the 55 nm on AMC's eASIC's 28 nm.  EASIC's 28 nm development has been upgraded to a full custom 28 nm. It is very simple, under the rules of the forum if you ask a poster not to post in your thread, he should start his own thread.  I have ask Entropy-uc not to post in my thread.  He has his own thread and this one to post in.  I saw how that worked out. I will do that in the Wednesday PR's Still insider trading, you sold on inside information.  That is a lot worst that anything I may have done.  That is like the pot calling the kettle black. I see that you did not say what your timing was when you sold your shares.  Mostly likely you sold because of being on the board and having inside information.   I plan on making the CC interface easy to use after the CC developers have the core tested and working. Yes I had not thought about that.  I will give that some thought. We will not transfer the shares to colored coins until it is proven.  There will be a beta on the Bitcoin testnet. We would first beta test on Bitcoin's testnet network, nothing to lose. After I get back to Springfield, enabling the shares on Crypto Trade will be on the top of my list.  Everyone will understand this after some future updates.  Mostly likely investors will need to make a choice now (Crypto-Trade or Colored Coins).  We won't have the man power or time to move the shares later from Crypto-Trade to Colored Coins or the other way around. Weekly Update 1/15/2013Here in San Jose working with our partners to move our projects down the line.  The RTL problem has been solved and I will be releasing more information about this over the next month.  I will also over the next month be releasing the timeline on our chips as the information becomes available to us.Kenneth E. Slaughter, CEO/CTOActive Mining CorporationVirtual Mining Corporation Weekly Update: 1/8/13Question From VinceSamios:Crypto-Trade and ChromaWallet (colored Coins).  As soon as we get time to finish theverification interface; however, our core business comes first and working on Intellihash.Our engineers are still designing our board. We had to change our engineering firm, and learn a few lessons about hiring an engineer firm.  We don't have a date at this time.Due to our inexperience with design, we have had a few set backs; however, we have hiredthe most competent RTL design team to make sure that when we spin up our chip it will work.  They arevery competent at Low-Power and getting the most speed from the chip.Not at this time.Comment From The CEOHow I see us going forward is we will get our chip and boards into production as soon as possible.  Active Mining is in one of the best positions to take advantage of the Bitcoin network.  Once we have our chips and boards in production this year we will be one of only two companies in the world which manufactures Bitcoin mining hardware and also mines.  With this combination we have unlimited availability to bitcoin mining hardware only limited by our resources.  What I see in the future is bitcoin's exchange rate for USD going to over $10,000 in the next year.  If this happens Active Mining with its own chip, our current resources which will be increasing with the exchange rate, and eASIC as our partner will put us in an excellent position to dominate our market.  Intellihash will just be an added boost should it turn out to be a game changer.Kenneth E.

Weekly Update 1/1/14Happy New Year!The new year looks bright for Active Mining as we continue to assemble our miners for quick delivery.Not a lot of changes from last weeks update:We are also continuing to develop our Intellihash program and with our 2013 sales at $6,311,788.33 we have a very good share of the market.We have been working 100% on our core business.ActiveMining-PR Staff Weekly Update 12/25/13Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.Here is a picture of our manufacturing line for assembling miners.Assembly LineWe are working on assembling everything, so when our boards and chips arrive, we can ship the miners fast. Sorry for the delay in getting Crypto-Trade up and running.  I am still working on some legal aspects of the tender offer. Colored Coins can be used for any virtual asset. Colored Coins NGCCC GUI Screenshot P2P Trade Screen Yes, but to take legal action you need to serve him and for that you need his address.  Anyone needing his address just PM me. There is a Balance sheet report in the Announcement with our Assets, and Liabilities.  The difference is the equity.  AMC had no income except for the Avalons  in BTC and paid all of that out as dividends in BTC.  You can look at the VMC P & L and that would be what AMC lost from its subsidiary VMC.   By the way, that gift to Ken of $5,000 went into the company coffers. And who in the hell is going to build these machines, these ASIC professionals. @VE  This is our foreign registered company for our Delaware Virtual Mining Corporation, we could not get that name in Missouri as I had it registered last year for another project.  Screenshots are not required they only help if something goes wrong, the only thing required is your Bitfunder username and having a public bitcoin address (see below).  We would like the number of shares transferred, and the date and time of the transfer also.  The automated system will require this; however, that does not mean that your shares will not get transferred. From Bitfunder: Well, if you have been reading the thread, we have said a number of times that you need to be able to sign the message, again this is just the backup system. No this is not the primary verification, this is the backup verification system.  So don't start sending these signed messages unless I ask you to send one. The transaction log has all of the above, plus the number of shares transferred, except email addresses and Bitcoin public address.  In the verification process we will check the above information in our transaction logs against what the user enters to verify the transaction, the user will add his email that he wants to use on Crypto-Trade. We have a number of "Asset List" saved,  to verify your shares with the Bitcoin address you will need to send a signed message which includes the date of your transfer, your Bitfunder username, the number of shares transferred, and the email address you want Crypto-Trade to create an account with.  Of course the Bitcoin address you send the signed message from has to be in anyone of our saved "Asset List".  Yes, if Bitfunder comes back up.  Should anyone not have access to that information, we will use their registered Bitcoin address as a backup. The transfer of shares from AMC-TENDER to Crypto-Trade will be an automated site to verify your shares, you will need your email address you want to register as a account on Crypto-Trade (fine if you already have an account using that email, shares will just be added to that account), number of shares transferred to AMC-TENDER, and your AMC-TENDER transfer date and time of transfer (from your Bitfunder transfer logs, or from the screenshot you made of the transfer).  We will have an announcement with the complete details as soon as the automated site is ready. I think testnet/local bitcoind with txindex/full scan. I am sure it would not do any good.  Having the sheriff give him a visit with a summons would be better.  We are in approval process on Crypto-Trade.
That is for ordered which have been place last week.  We have a pre-order queue, so if you are at the end of the queue, then the wait is about 2 months. Cross Posted from the "Official Active Mining Thread"From Bitfunder shutdown notice:It seems that Bitfunder has shutdown all of ActiveMining accounts.  This was expected due to my "Legal Demand For Payment" and the fact that I released the information about meeting with our lawyers.This is also why we had a cutoff date on the transfers to AMC-TENDER"; however, I was still accepting transfers, but it was expected that Ukyo "God Of Bitfunder" would use his almighty power to shut off our accounts.  So the last transaction time to AMC-TENDER is 2013-11-30 20:35:59.  Any transfers after that date will be limbo, until we can get the records.  This will also apply to the automatic transfers that Ukyo promised on December 2.  In our law suite we will try and recover the records after the above date using discovery.To me this just shows to what lengths Ukyo/Ukto will go to to cover his ass.

Very good, now the Investors guarantee is now $3.00/Share @ $1,200 and it was .30/Share @ $120 Bitcoins.  Seems like a win for the Investors. Did you notice this  You will be fine on Crypto-Trade with the same email.  Your shares will just be added to your account. November Announcement Active Mining Corporation (Belize)PROGRESS REPORTAs of November 30th 2013First I want to thank all of our Investors for trusting in us.  We are working hard in this very competitive environment to make all of our Investors successful.  Now a few things have changed since our IPO.  First, there is a lot more competition in the 28nm marketplace such as, Cointerra, Hashfast, Bitmine, KnCMiner, and Butterfly Labs.  Before this last tremulous increase in the exchange rate of Bitcoins and Knc's shipping of their miners the difficulty was so high that our machines would not ROI.  During this period we have been working on R & D to improve our products performance to be able to compete with the 400 GH/s and 500 GH/s chips.  VMC expects to be able to compete with these competitiors with its increase in performance using our Intellihash(tm) technology.  We will be introducing our Fast-Hash One Smart Edition and will have an upgrade path for our current customers. Bitcoin:AMC expects Bitcoin to continue to rise in price over the next quarter as global acceptance of the virtual currency continues to explode.New exchange for shares crypto-trade.We have been contacted by Crypto-Trade in Hong Kong and will be moving our shares to their exchange.  We feel that this will be the best place for our shares to be traded until we have a tested solution with a decentralized trading and dividends method.  Crypto-Trade will be accepting our list of sharesholders and their number of shares and will create accounts automatically.  There is no need to sign up for an account on Crypto-Trade as it will be created for you.November Sales:As of this writing we have over 2.1 Million in sales for November, this excludes any fraudulent sales, I.e the $933,000 sales which was fraudulent and proven on the thread and a $3,000,000 sales which looks fraudulent.  AMC expects its sales of VMC's Bitcoin mining machines to continue to grow as it has the highest TH/s machines in the marketplace.  AMC expects the difficulty to continue to rise at an explosive rate.  AMC expects this explosive rate to drive adoption of VMC's 24 TH/s which has the lowest space requirement and the highest redundancy of any manufacturers machines. Shipping:We have this last week shipped our first products to customers.Intellihash(tm)Intellihash is our new trademark for our new Bitcoin mining software which gives up to a 20% increase in hashing speed and has the possibility to increase the speed of our mining machines as the difficulty goes up.  We have had to modify the software in our chips to make it work with our new software.  The chips are going to be late; however, our new Intellihash software could be a game changer for the company. AMC Cash Position:AMC is in an excellent position with the rise in Bitcoins this last month.  As of this date at the current price of Bitcoins we have over 2.3 Million in liquid assets, this includes Bitcoins, Cash from VMC, and   AMC purchased ActiveMining shares.  During the time since the IPO, AMC has paid out all of the revenue from the Avalons which is a total of 667.22167902 BTC ( $812,676.01 ) USD including the accumulated dividends to be paid out when all the shares are moved to a new exchange.  Also, AMC has added additional hashing power from our Klondikes.  AMC expects to use its Intellihash technology to increase its revenue with its existing machines until its eASIC designed chip is in full production.Increased margins on sales:Due to the rise in Bitcoin, we have increased our margins on our Bitcoin mining machines.  We expect this to help VMC's profit in the 1st quarter of next year.Bitfunder/WeExchange Problems:We have ~106 BTC in the Bitfunder/WeExchange system which we can not obtain.  We have sent Bitfunder's/WeExchange's Ukyo a Legal Demand For Payment within 72 hours.  We expect this problem to result in the loss of the 106 BTC.  We are meeting with our Lawyers to determine what our next steps will be.  This 106 BTC has been deducted from our liquid cash position above.

I have all of the AMC-TENDER transactions saved in a number of places as backups.   You are exactly right.  Just what I have been thinking. Not all we can do! One problem you are causing is that your above post is basically Blackmail. Silence the troll(s);Edit:  I see what you mean, big news to silence the troll(s).  Well what I was talking about is big news in the form of a software solution that will silence the trolls. As Pankkake is now a blackmailer requesting BTC to not post.  Why would we not want him to post, because the only thing he post is FUD. No problem, good idea. Cross Posted Here from "Hire A Troll"I have a lot better solution which will put an end to your business.  Send 1 BTC a day to  1DJpsvnM7xTnQbWEhLYyCyfxQyxwupEzCa for all the problems you have caused or I will give away this solution to any one that wants to make you STFU.  I will be deploying this in our Active Mining thread soon and you will see what it does.

Updated Information On Transfers To AMC-TENDER Yes, it does not sound good for the UK exchange.  It looks like we can start testing Colored Coins in next few weeks.  Are they padded? Colored Coins Almost Beta Wrong, Maybe, in the UK by law they are "beans" or in other words a commodity.  I think this is what they should be in the US too.  So, in the UK it would be trading contracts or a barter transaction. From WoodTech about CIPHERTRADE: Company 3rd Quarter Reports Thanks. $933,592.80 Sale Today.  Looks like a good sale.6 24.576 TH/s Fash-Hash One Platinum machines. The machines are priced in fiat, so the promise is in fiat. This is very important to us.  This is our moto: "If You Make Your Customers Successful, You Will Be Successful".  Now that being said we have no control over the difficulty, so we are working on R & D to make our machines run faster.  Now, here is our promise to our customers, if at anytime before we ship the machine to our customer and the machine will not return a positive ROI within the first year, we will at their option refund 100% of the purchase price of the machine.  A total of 25M, but only 10M listed until .0025 is paid in dividends. Yes, we are working on it. VMC Sales:3rd Quarter 2013           $1,404,217October 2013                   $520,898Total Sales YTD             $1,925,115 Yes, you can make more that one transfer. As soon as we have a solution in place, yes all AMC-TENDER shares will receive accumulated dividends. As I have said before, all mining revenue goes to that one address; however, we don't have all systems set up to automatically send payouts, some we have to send manually.  So, that being said you will see more revenue in our mining address when we manually send those payouts. Good idea; however, I will have to wait until the deadline, so that everyone receives their dividends. The dividends are being accumulated on all the shares in AMC-TENDER.  This is why the dividends have been suspended until we get all the shares into AMC-TENDER, so that everyone receives their dividends.  After we have a solution for the trading of our shares, be that "Direct Shares", "Pass-Through-Shares", or "Listed Shares" we will distribute the accumulated dividends.  That is correct, we are just holding the shares until we have a solution, then we will announce the procedure for transferring the shares. 
Colored Coins Developer Update We are working on the details at the moment.  We want our shares to be trade-able, within the legal limits of the law.  No problem, we will give all investors all the chances to prove they own the shares.  We don't want anyone to lose any of our shares.  We are saving the asset list on a regular basis.  Also, there is a person that is saving the asset list every 10 minutes. No, not at this time.  AnnouncementDue to Bitfunder closing down, we are extending the deadline to transfer shares to AMC-TENDER until November 13th, 2013.At this time all shareholders should follow the procedure for transferring shares to AMC-TENDER.Dividends which are due to be paid tomorrow will be suspended until we have the share problem solved.We will be creating Pass-Through shares on a yet undetermined exchange for our shareholders.After the Pass-Through is created, we will pay the suspended dividends.Active Mining Corporation (Belize) Edit:  All transfers to AMC-TENDER must be completed by UTC November 28, 2013.  Only transfers to AMC-TENDER will be transferred to a new exchange. I will me making an announcement later today about our solution to the Bitfunder problem. Not really. Yes, this is one of the cost in the offering description.What we are trying to do is increase our mining and increase our dividends to our shareholders. Yes,  this is the only address that we send mining revenue to.  We will be reserving 50% of the new revenue for growth and expenses. Yes, dividends will be paid as normal on the 6th verified or not. On the 6th everyone that has shares in the AMC-TENDER account will start accumulating dividends.  We will be working on a solution to have the dividends disbursed.  We have a number of options available to do the disbursements.  As the whole Bitcoin stock exchange system is in a state of flux, we are waiting to see how everything shakes out.  We will be getting an opinion from our lawyers on the new Havelock developments.  We need to see if the new Havelock developments changes anything for any of our Investors. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=297543.0 We have a list of transfers to the AMC-TENDERS account listing the number of shares  and the bitfunder username.  We will use the Bitcoin address to verify the Bitfunder username and the transfer information. Due to the Klondikes showing up this week after being ordered for 5 Months and the deployment of other resources for mining, we are going to delay ourP & L and Balance sheet reports until the 15th of November. Have 32 of my 68 Klondikes hashing, still working some of the bugs out of our set up.I don't have them up to full speed yet.Seems like I only have 1 bad one out of 32. Announcement:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=297543.msg3445996#msg3445996 London, UK  October 30, 2013  Active Mining Corporation (AMC) today announced that they have added over 1TH+ to their hashing rate.  This additional hashing rate has been added from the 68 Klondikes and 1088 Avalon chips that were ordered last May 3rd, plus the addition of other hashing resources.  This brings ActiveMining's hashing resources to a total of ~1.4 TH/s.  Over the next few weeks ActiveMining expects to add up to an additional 3 TH/s to their mining operation.  We are working with our Lawyers on these points, of which one of our lawyers has worked at the SEC.
We will be releasing some updates this next month.We would love to give our shareholder special prices on rigs and may in the future; however, in this very competitive environment margins are very tight.  Yes, we are on there radar, as they have talked to Ukto about us last month.  I sent Ukto our Belize documents so he could send them to the SEC.Edit:  Ukto never sent the documents to the SEC. We are hoping tomorrow, if everything works as expected. All of our Klondikes have been received and we are in the process of getting them up and hashing.We expect that each Klondike will hash at ~5 GH/s for a total of ~340 GH/s increasing our total hashing power to ~770 GH/s.Of course, this is not what we expected by this time to be hashing after we ordered 20,000 Avalon chips @ 5.64 TH/s which did not arrive at the stated time and had to be refunded.  Non-US residents that have been verified will be able to trade our shares on Bitfunder.  I have not heard any different from Ukto the operator of Bitfunder.Dividends will be paid on Bitfunder, just like they have been paid before thru the end of the year. Yes, everyone should have a public bitcoin address that they can sign. Also keep a full screenshot showing your bitfunder username, and the transfer transaction of the transfer to AMC-TENDER.This is your proof of the number of shares transferred.  We may need you to send a message from that public bitcoin address with the details of your transfer at a future time.Please don't PM your transfer information. Received my order of Klondikes today.  Great packaging no damage.  The units look great and had all the cables to connect the units.Great job Steamboat!Edit:  These are as-is units as I can get the hardware to program them. If you don't have s smartphone:Here is a link that has in Step 2 how to setup 2-factor without a smartphone.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=111943.0It would be best to use this on a off-line computer for security, but that is not required. 68 Klondikes in Batch 1 ~Customer #3 have been shipped.  Klondikes have been shipped, should be hashing in about 5 days. Yes, lets do that.Edit:  I am doing everything in my power to make this work out. Yes, that would be the safe way, to make sure you receive your dividends. We will be using the Bitfunder transaction logs and asset list from Bitfunder.  Investors will need to be able to sign the Bitcoin address in their Bitfunder account at a later date.   Important Notice (October 23th, 2013):Please be advised that ActiveMining is implementing the following rules and procedures for Investors wanting to keep their shares:Investors who fail for any reason to provide the information necessary to obtain "Verified" status on Bitfunder are encouraged to transfer their shares on BitFunder to the Bitfunder user AMC-TENDER no later than November 6, 2013 before dividends are paid.  All Investors transferring their shares to this account will continue to accumulated dividends on their shares.  The October 30th dividends will be suspended and accumulated for payment on November 6, 2013.   Important Notice (October 23th, 2013):Please be advised that ActiveMining is implementing the following rules and procedures for Investors wanting to keep their shares:Investors who fail for any reason to provide the information necessary to obtain "Verified" status on Bitfunder are encouraged to transfer their shares on BitFunder to the Bitfunder user AMC-TENDER no later than November 13, 2013 before dividends are paid.  All Investors transferring their shares to this account will continue to accumulated dividends on their shares.  The October 30th dividends will be suspended and accumulated for payment on November 6, 2013. Edit:  See the post below on the Bitfunder shutdown.  Yes, you need to have a public Bitcoin address that you can sign, so that we can verify the number of shares you own from the Bitfunder Asset List. Yes, we are working on those. Me too! Amazing. I believe 100% in what we are doing!  If you look at the quote I used, that will tell you the whole story of were I am coming from.  I am sorry that I did not project the confidence that some of our Investors needed.  I am very confident that ActiveMining will come through the hard times ahead with the difficulty rising at over 117%/month.  So as I said "When the going gets tough, the tough get going".  I am in this for the long haul, working hard everyday to make ActiveMining and its Investors successful.   As I have said before in this thread, we will have a solution for Investors who what to keep their shares.
We will be announcing a solution for users to transfer their shares to an account on Bitfunder for us to hold and for the shares to receive dividends.  This will be before Ukyo pushes the shares back to the issuer account.  We are trying to be pro-active to help our Investors. No Yes, we are working on the core business also. Working on that solution also, but it is not a fast solution. Still only 10,000,000 shares. I don't think so, as they are at the ~same price as on Bitfunder. Yes. Sell and Buy, at this point. 600,000 Available. ActM shares now listed on Crypto:Stocks Look at this 2 BTC carry over from last week. We will be using our own technology to keep track of the last sale price, bids and ask.  The colored coins will only be used to store the assets. With this money maker:Baby JetEdit:  I think the network is going to crush HashFast. Working on our Colored Coins Program. Here is a good link for that infomation http://www.tcc5.com/gopublicconsultation.php The direct escrow transfer system will allow an Investor to transfer shares to another Investor after they have made a deal outside of the site (Forum, IRC, eMail, etc.).   Since it is an escrow system the Investor buying the shares has to have the BTC in his account.  When the transfer is made and accepted, then the shares are transferred to the buyer and the BTC is transferred to the Seller. No, not at this time due to current environment.  We would have to do what Bitfunder is doing with US citizens.  We will be trying to use a lot of the technology in our new site in our colored coins development.  We expect that our colored coins development will generate additional revenue for ActiveMining. We will be posting the procedure for transferring shares as soon as the final site testing and setup is finished. ANNOUNCEMENTShort Term Solution:We now have a solution to the Bitfunder problem for our Investors who choose or are forced to not stay on Bitfunder.  Our own Stock Exchange is finished and is undergoing final implemtation testing and setup.  Due to the current environment we will not be enabling trading on this site; however, it will be used to store anyones shares and to pay dividends.After we obtain legal advice which says that we are ok to do this, we will implement on the site, a direct escrow transfer system.Long Term Solution:We will implement a direct transfer system using colored coins.

We are still working on a solution; however, I don't feel Havelock would be a solution as the SEC will soon just send them a letter also.  Then they will have to do just what Bitfunder did.  We will make sure that our Investors wherever they are do not lose their shares and that they will continue to receive their dividends. VMC Sales:3rd Quarter 2013           $1,404,217
Yes, sales figures for the last quarter.  The above figures are revenue not sales.  Sales for August ~$330,000. This answers a few of you questions:http://www.tcc5.com/gopublicconsultation.php Mining is legal in the US, should mining become illegal in US we would move our mining fram(s) outside the country.  I don't see mining being illegal anytime soon in the US.   I think decentralized is the only way to go as this will happen to any other centralized exchange.  Looking into the Namecoin code to create a decentralized exchanged.  As was said above it can be merged mined with Bitcoin.  We could uses our own miners to get it going. No, I am working on solutions.  Expect some type of solution, work around in the next 24 hours. Yes, we have funds if needed for development. I have sent a message to 796.com about setting up ActiveMining there.  This could be a stop gap solution until we could do a colored coin client or an Alt coin solution. Working on that as we speak. You would have to have mining, to support the network.  The miners would receive fees for the transactions, just like Bitfunder receives fees now. @VolanicEruptor  So, I caused it to plummeted this far, VE Get Real.  Nothing to do with BTC-TC closing down and Bitfunder cutting off US Citizens, just me caused this panic.  Get Real. You got that right! Yes, I have looked into it somewhat, I might be looking into it some more soon. This is the problem, you are trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. I agree. Yes, I have looked into registering this last weekend. Havelock will have the same problem soon, I think. And where would the shares trade? No, Active Mining Corporation is based in Belize, and with Bitfunder changing to not targeting US citizens, it will be legal.  I am sure, if any other country, send Ukyo a C & D letter, he would just cut off those IP as well.  Right now it is the SEC that is the problem, and that will be solved not serving US citizens. YesEdit:  I am sure there will be discussions on the board. All we could do is what we have done.  We did not know for sure what was going to happen, but it has happened before to the "Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange".
It will not be any different, it is there in the even Bitfunder was to close down, to protect our Investors.  At this point we see that Bitfunder is staying open, unlike BTC-TC, to non US citizens. We will setup a system to pay dividends to your Bitcoin address on Bitfunder, this is what the address had been set up for. @VolanicEruptor, You need to understand the structure of the company, before you start telling me that I am contradicting what I have said in the past.  I do own ActiveMining shares; however, I do not own Active Mining Corporation shares. Active Mining Corporation, seen this coming a long time ago, and has taken steps including incorporating in Belize and creating our own exchange in the event one is needed.  We have also retain legal council (Marco Santori of Nesenoff & Miltenberg LLP) and a member of the Bitcoin Foundation to advise us on our position as a Belize Corporation.My status as a US citizen should not affect Active Mining Corporation as I do not own any of the shares of the corporation. Since ActiveMining is a Belize corporation ( I have sent documents to Ukyo showing our incorporation in Belize ) trading of ActiveMining on Bitfunder should not be affected in any way except the loss of US Citizens account.  Now would be an excellent time to pick up those extra shares at a bargin price if you are not a US citizen.  Also, those transfer which I was going to finish transferring tomorrow before the dividend payment, I will start transferring as soon as possible.  It is very important to me to make my Investors successful.  I am thinking and working everyday on how to increase ActiveMining worth.  Over 15 years developing electronics On the 15th. The PCIe boards are being designed by our Professional Engineers. This is what our shopping cart is estimating, based on the pre-order queue.  It should be before this date. We have 68 Klondikes ordered with full assembly which is ~306 GH/s, we are ~3rd customer in batch 1.Here is an email from steamboat. Next Wednesday from the above post is today, Oct 2nd. All BTC-TC to Bitfunder transfers have been processed.  If anyone has not received their shares send an email to transfer@activeminingcorp.com with your details. The Klondikes were designed by Bkkcoin, this was our first purchase of Avalon chips a total of 1,150 which 1088 was being used on 68 Klondikes boards.  No, we are using professional engineers with lots of experience to design our boards. No, only one transfer per email. All shares that were on BTC-TC have been issued to AMC on Bitfunder, and are being transferred to investors by AMC when an investor has been verified to have owned the shares on BTC-TC. NoEdit:  To be clear, the time to transfer will run out when it is not 9/30 anywhere in the world, since I did not state a time zone.  Which is UTC -12.  We must receive in our email box your transfer before 12:00 UTC on October 1, 2013 Yes you can.  Just a reminder that ActiveMining trading will be frozen after 9/30 on BTC-TC and if you have not already transferred your shares to Bitfunder you should do it before October 1. We were in the first batch @ 3rd customer, so we have been waiting on the boards, yes, I know that have had trouble getting all 16 chips to hash.  Steamboat, has been working on getting it to work; however, I think we are at the point now to request a refund. Edit:  It was also reported that the chips in steamboat's batch 1 were shipped 2 week ago.  We could also use the chips on our own Avalon clone boards. The Klondikes are 4.5 GH/s * 68 boards = 306 GH/s Waiting on the Klondikes to get here, if not soon, then we will ask for a refund.  We are in his batch 1 about the 3 customer.
BTC-TC stops trading on Oct 7th, not on Oct 30th and that strange reason is that we have a lot better things to do running the company than transferring shares.  Also, it give us a week to clean up any errors or anything else that might have happen during the transfer of the shares.  @RoadStress, I wish you could read, the post says when the site goes live.  Just a note, that I have had an Interview with Nick of http://thefreebitcoinslist.com/ and VMC will be the first interview on this site when it goes live:http://thefreebitcoinslist.com/The interview will also be played on BitCast-Radio.com tonight. Just a note, that I have had an Interview with Nick of http://thefreebitcoinslist.com/ and VMC will be the first interview on this site when it goes live:http://thefreebitcoinslist.com/I think the interview will also be played on BitCast-Radio.com this weekend. We will be updating our Sales figures after the end of the month. This is just due to the transfer issue, with the way dividends work on the exchange.  Since the shares are in limbo, being moved from one exchange to the other it would be hard to pay the dividends.  So we are waiting until after everything is settled. Today's DividendsToday's Dividend will be delayed until next WednesdayThis is due to the ongoing transfer of shares from BTC-TC to Bitfunder.  So, before dividends are paid out on Wednesday of next week all transfers of shares to bitfunder will have to be completed.  The dividend on Wednesday will be larger than normal and also we will start paying the dividend on Wednesday of each week.Also, note that trading in ActiveMining on BTC-TC will be frozen after September 30th on BTC-TC. Most likely your transfer has been put into the error bin, or the unknown user bin.  These will get processed after all the transfers that do not have any problems.  I just checked your transfer and it has been verified, so don't worry.  We will be transferring most of the shares tomorrow as we did most of the verification today. Thanks. I think you have got more PR this last week, than when we had a PR guy. You got that right!  I was hoping that the Tender offer was the last time I was going to do this.  At least it is half as many shares only 3M. Yes, I would like to.  Don't know if I will have time. The new exchange with AMC as the owner of the corporation that runs the Stock Exchange will only happen if there are not any other options for shares to be traded on an exchange.  Should the new exchange not be needed in the long term, it may be sold with the provision that ActiveMining could be listed there in the future at no listing charge. See the announcement thread for instructions on transferring shares from BTC-TC to Bitfunder. Virtual Mining CorporationReports:Balance SheetProfit And LossCash FlowConsolidated Active Mining Corporation and VMC reports will be release by November 30th 2013 Seems like that would be what we would do. No, setup is required, as we already have planned for this.  All I have to do is take the shares off of BTC-TC and issue the shares on Bitfunder. Yes, the profit would go to AMC as that corporation would be owned by AMC.
I will look in to Havelock; however, we will have to get approved and pay the fee if required. Did not pay the required fee, as I did not need that company any longer.  Yes, since we are operating in Missouri, we had to file as a foreign corporation, but could not use the Virtual Mining name as it is taken. You get a Trademark by using it, then you can registered it at the uspto.gov, then it becomes a registered trademark.Yes, we will give refunds if we can not deliver on time. We had two exchanges set up just in case something happened like this. Then as a backup plan, we developed our own.   So, I think it is better to have two exchanges trading the shares.   I will be putting together a plan today and will post it here. I see what you mean; however, see my post about the Stock Exchange being spun off. Yes, it would. No, it is owned by the AMC (Belize) right now; however, it will have to be spun off to a different corporation before it can start operations, as AMC does not have the proper license to hold 3rd party funds. Sure, that is a possibility also. Sorry, VE, but no I am not referring to "direct shares". Yes, at this time AMC owns the exchange. I have already though about that.  AMC already has a Stock Exchange built and is in the testing phase.  If Bitfunder is shutdown also, shares would be transferred to Active Mining Corporation own Stock Exchange.  To avoid problems with the US, the Stock Exchange will block all US IP's and ask during signup if you are a US citizen. BTC-TC SHUTDOWN INFORMATIONBTC-TC Investors will be able to transfer their shares to Bitfunder before the shutdown.ActiveMining will post the information on the procedure to transfer shares to Bitfunder later today in this thread.Edit:  And also in our Announcements thread. Just a quick note on the BTC-TC shutdown.We will be looking into this problem today, and will post a solution later today.  All investors on BTC-TC should have their bitcoin address set.  Also, I would have a bitfunder account set up if you don't already have one. Bitfunder, BTC-TC Dividends Paid [0.00000130/Share] TSMC aims to have chip design kits for its 16-nm process available in January with the first foundation IP blocks such as standard cells and SRAM blocks ready a month later. It will start limited so-called risk production of the 16-nm process in November 2013. Production chip tape outs will follow about four or five quarters later. No, we have funds to increase our hash rate.Sales are good, August was a 400% increase over July, and I expect September to be an increase over August.Yes, we are moving in the right direction. Link to Steamboats update for our batch 1 Klondikeshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=192916.msg3184148#msg3184148 We can purchase 1 to any number of chips at a higher prices per chip.The mining plan is to build our own chip (as you can not count on anyone else as we have seen with Avalon) and use that to mine with.Once we have our own chip, we can order any number that we want. Soon we hope, they will be on the 68 Klondike boards. This is where we will post Active Mining Announcements (Read Only)Santa Clara, CA and Springfield, MO  September 4, 2013  eASIC Corporation, a leading provider of NEW ASIC devices and Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC) today announced that VMC will use eASICs 28nm Nextreme-3 devices to create a series of scalable Bitcoin mining machines capable of generating up to 24.756 TH/s (tera hashes per second) of cryptographic hashes.Read Full eASIC Press Release

Active Mining Announcements ActiveMining F.A.Q.What is ActiveMining?ActiveMining is the natural evolution of two previous projects: Active Mining Cooperative (creating a bitcoin mining farm) and Virtual Mining Corporation (selling bitcoin mining hardware), that are now unified under the roof of ActiveMining. Both original contract proposals were quite complex, so we decided to rip them apart and start from scratch, using the same tried and tested model of Asicminer. This allows for a much needed flexibility that is key in the bitcoin world.Where can I buy ActiveMining shares?Currently, there is only one way to do that:You can buy ActiveMining shares directly from CryptStocksWhat is the Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC)?VMC is a subsidiary of ActiveMining that is in charge of building hardware. Think of it as a department of ActiveMining, with all its profits funneled into ActiveMining shareholders.So, where can I see the current ActiveMining hashrate and mining profits?Currently ActiveMining mines on BTC Guild at around ~700GH/s, as User 211435 and as Team AMC. Accumulated mining profits are stored in BTC address 1DJpsvnM7xTnQbWEhLYyCyfxQyxwupEzCa. Here's a graph of that.What are the current plans for chip development?ActiveMining is developing a 28nm Bitcoin mining chip using eASIC. Chip samples delivered in 9 weeks;Low-volume chip production starting in 12 weeks, using an e-beam process;Normal volume chip production starting in 16-18 weeks.Can you please provide some documents as proof of the existing claims?Engineering Firm quote for the machines that will host the incoming Avalon chips: http://axs.net/AMC/SB-Prototype-Quote.jpgeASIC chip NDA: http://axs.net/AMC/eAsic-NDA0001.jpg and http://axs.net/AMC/eAsic-NDA0002.jpgeASIC Press Releases ActiveMining Official Discussion ThreadIntroductionActiveMining is a virtual identity totally owned by the Active Mining Corporation (Belize) that represents both itself and its profits. ActiveMining's business includes cryptocoin mining and sales of self-built ASIC devices through its wholly owned subsidiary Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC).Currently, it is expected for interested ActiveMining's public investors to hold 10,000,000 ActiveMining shares (40% of the profits), while Active Mining Corporation owner(s) shall hold 15,000,000 ActiveMining shares (60% of the profits), for a total of 25,000,000 ActiveMining virtual shares that represent 100% of the global profits of ActiveMining.The issuing of more ActiveMining shares can be allowed in the future, as a last resort measure and after a shareholder's vote, provided there is strong economic justification, mainly on the basis of covering emergent capital needs. Existing shareholders also get the first choice for buying new shares before they are sold on the open market. The volume of new shares shall be kept at a minimum as much as possible and the pricing of them should be such that the total value of all ActiveMining's assets (tangible and intangible) per ActiveMining share does not diminish, protecting shareholders as much as possible from future dilution of value.Public investor's protection planThe first 10,000,000 ActiveMining shares have the privilege of getting all profits until BTC0.0025/share is paid, starting from the day when dividends begin to be paid.How to buy sharesActiveMining shares will be sold on BitFunder and BTCT.CO and any other exchange, following asset approval or tendered by AMC shares. Existing Active Mining Cooperative (AMC) shareholders will be entitled to tender their shares for ActiveMining shares, on a 1:1 basis and are also covered in the public investor's protection plan.Dividend paymentThe global ActiveMining's income, including mining income, hardware sales via bitcoins, other cryptocoins and fiat transferred to bitcoins, will be paid to ActiveMining shareholders proportionally, when all manufacturing, maintenance, labor costs, R&D, growth and miscellaneous expenses are deducted. The first BTC0.0025/share dividends will only be paid to the first 10,000,000 ActiveMining shares, providing public investors a priority in getting back 100% return of their investment.Our chips in developmentGeneration 1: Fast-Hash. 28nm. Each chip's rated frequency is 800 MHz at 1.15V. It translates to 16,000 MH/s because it does 20 hashes per cycle. Chip requires proper handling of heat and power supply. It is expected the chip can be overclocked to 1000 MHz @ 20,000 MH/s.eASIC Press Release"Our existing hardware assets from AMC liquidation6 Avalon miners, currently running on BTC Guild under "Team AMC" for around 430 GH/s;An order of Avalon chips from steamboat's batch #1, for 68 Klondike-16 boards, rated at 68*16*282 = 307 GH/s;AMC owns Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC) which is a manufacturer of Bitcoin Mining Machines:Virtual Mining WebsiteVMC Website:July Visitors:           10,135August Visitors:       12,676 September Visitors: 26,894 9/19.       VMC Sales:2013 sales $6,311,788.33                  Good idea!

It never will be; however, when they release their products on their website, then we can talk about them. We will have to have reserves for building the Pre-Ordered machines, as well as charges for the engineering, paying for the chips from eASIC, etc before any profit will be made.  There are a lot of expenses in manufacturing a product, of which a lot of those have to be paid up front, i.e eASIC NRE, Engineers NRE, manufacturing overhead and fixed expenses of manufacturing the product.  These charges will have to be charged back to the product based on the expected production numbers.  Yes, I do expect to make a good profit for shareholders, but do understand that there are a lot of expenses. eASIC's Nexteme-3 is not released, so we are still under NDA.  Only thing we can say about it, is what is in the Press Release. We will be operating like a normal company, except we will have weekly dividends not quarterly dividends.  We will do the accounting for the previous month using normal accounting methods, if the accounting shows a profit, then we will declare a dividend allowing for some of the profit to be retained for growth per the description, this dividend then will be split over the number of weeks in the month that the dividend will be paid in.  AMC is paying the dividends, AMC is doing the mining, VMC is doing the manufacturing and of course is not making a profit at this point.   I am working on hiring a PR firm.  Lot of things are going to be happening in the next few weeks and months. In the above statement, I was speaking about myself, as I have purchase shares on the open market for myself, and  I am also [going to] purchase shares for my own account.  The first statement was in the past and the second statement was in the present all on the same account. I only have one personal account on bitfunder which I use to trade in which I had before I started AMC/VMC.  I do have another account on bitfunder, but I have not made any trades for ActiveMining in that account.  When I said now above, I meant that I was in the process of purchasing shares, as you see from the listing of my account I had on 1.02 BTC which is from dividends.  I knew that I did not have very much in that account, so I was going to put some BTC into that account and purchase some shares.  I seen the post about not caring about the share price or having any shares and that is when I made that post.  We are working hard on doing that.  We have our Manufacturing computer up and running and inputting all the transactions at the same time we are working on sales, building prototypes, working with our engineers, setting up the warehouse, etc.Yes, I have a board member working on hiring a PR guy. Accepted.Here is the proof. No, those are the last trades I made.  I was getting ready to purchase some shares today.  I was getting ready to send over some BTC to WeExchange to make a purchase when I made that post.  Don't think I will now, but if I do I will post the trade here within the next 10 days.  The August trades are the last ones I have made, I have been way to busy the last few weeks.  Need to be working now.

Yes, we have received the refund from Avalon.  We will be releasing P&L for this quarter by the end of October. All income from sales of hardware and anything else that VMC gets income on will be included in the profit calculation. I really like this.  This would be good on some videos as our opening logo. I don't have a license to use that one.  Last time I put it up, lewicki got all pissed off, after he told me that he would sign it over to ActM. Hideous artwork is gone, don't have a different logo for the site.  There you go. Yes, but you do not know that it will do that.  Also, there are a lot of back office functions that we use that are not in the lewicki site. Yes, lewicki web site looks good; however, it is an unproven site.  Our current site is making 8X times what we are spending on advertising.  Also, there have already been some licensing problems with the site that lewicki developed.

Sorry, been working all day on eAsic deal and doing the transfers. The schedule was to fly back home on Thursday; however, we had to extend the trip 1 extra day at the engineers. Just got back in town, plane was delayed about 4 hours on the west coast.  I will have pictures and full report up on the threadas soon as possible. Due to the fact that I just got in from our business trip toeAsic and our Engineers, I will be transferring shares as soon as possible.There is some very important work that needs to be done first.All tendered shares will be paid this dividend.  Active Mining, AMC Dividends Paid [.00000574]  Hello all!  I just wanted to pass along a few updates while I am onsite meeting with the engineering firm regarding the Avalon clones.  First though, I would like to apologize for the delay on transferring the shares from AMC-TENDER back into your accounts on BitFunder as ActiveMining shares.  It has been a hectic week(s) and I have not had time to get these processed.  I am planning on having all of the tendered shares in AMC-TENDER out the door by end of business Friday along with dividends after the transfer.  I cannot get to these until Friday because I am still on the west coast finalizing some orders of business with the engineers on the prototypes. Remaining shares that are not in the AMC-TENDER account: I have talked to Ukyo, hopefully, regarding the remaining shares on AMC BitFunder, and what we can do to get them automatically processed and transferred over to ActiveMining.  At this point, I would like to request that no one else sends me their AMC shares to AMC-TENDER, so that they can all be converted automatically. I will manually tender any remaining shares in the queue before then as well so no one is left behind. Yes, I had a meeting with this particular Engineer last Friday.  We had a beer and talked about ASIC's in general, RTL programming, and a number of other things. I will be working on getting all the transfers completed tomorrow. Shareholder Update:Hello everyone, I wanted to give a quick update to every investor as it pertains to this weeks proceedings.  We had several meetings yesterday, namely the meeting with eASIC which went extremely well.  The ground work has been laid and everything is in motion for the NRE as planned down to the smallest of details.  I caution everyone that it will take us a couple of weeks to complete the painstaking process of getting all the funds converted and on to eASIC.  Please understand for business and legal reasons that we cannot go into any more detail at this time.  I would like to say that the future for Active Mining and its shareholders is exceptionally bright and I am over enthused with how this week has played out.  An official announcement will be released in due course.Kenneth E. Slaughter, CEO/CTOVirtual Mining CorporationActive Mining Corporation Everything is great with eAsic, still working with Tradehill to get setup.  Sorry, to be so short with the response to VE.  Had to get the dividends out today.  
ActiveMining, AMC Dividends paid [.00000517] ActiveMining, AMC Dividends paid [.00000517]  I will be working on dividends tonight.  Since we are now on PDT and had a ton of meeting today they will be late. That meeting is today. NOTICE:  ALL AMC-PT SHARES WILL BE TENDERED FOR ActiveMining Shares ASAP NOTICE:  ALL AMC-PT SHARES WILL BE TENDERED FOR ActiveMining Shares ASAP 5 @ 4, 2 @ 4.25 YesAgent:Belize Offshore Services Limited.IBC No 134,964 Private Placement Memorandumhttp://axs.net/AMC/PPM/AM.pdf We really don't have time to do anything like that.  Getting this going takes all of our time. Transferring shares takes up valuable time that we need to work on our companies plans, so at this time we won't have a transfer plan available. Just to clarify Active Mining Corporation (Belize) (AMC) position:The operations in the US are Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC) only which is wholly owned subsidiarity of AMC and is not issuing public securities of any kind.  ActiveMining shares are being issued by Active Mining Corporation (Belize).  Because AMC owns VMC which is a Delaware Corporation does not put them under the SEC.  VMC is also running all of the mining operations for AMC here in the US. I am working on this now.  Shares will be automatically tendered. This all looks good for AMC as the stock exchanges are in another country and AMC is not a US company, it is a Belize company. BTC-TC,Anonymous voted NO with comment: No evidence that I've found as yet that VMC is actually shipping operational hardware. No evidence of 28nm ASICs either. Will amend vote if evidence of live, hashing equipment is provided (not screenshots of e-commerce sites selling pre-orders!).  October/November Active Mining Deploys and Sells our 1st Gen 28nm 16 GH/s chip.  Modular Deployment for Active Mining's mining farm with up to 24.576 TH/s per 34U's of rack space.  Now that is good stuff if I say so myself. I like the one on the bottom, see my PM. Well, it is better than having the company in this country.  There is a law (SEC) that if the stock exchange is out side of the US and you are not targeting US citizens you are exempt from registering.  We are not doing anything to target US citizens, in fact on Bitfunder we don't know where the shareholders live same on BTC-TC; however on BTC-TC we have their email address.  BTC-TC is registered in Belize so that stock exchange is outside the country.  The company is out side the country and we are not targeting US citizens. Yes, do a transfer of your shares you wish to tender to AMC-TENDER, then send an email to tender@activeminingcorp.com with the information above.  I will then process your tender by verifying your tender shares, and then transferring the same number of shares of ActiveMining to you. I have finished all the transfer that did not have any kind of problems.I will go through all the transfers tomorrow that have any kind of problems andtry a resolve the problems.  I will email anyone that has transfers that I cannot resolve their problem.This week dividends cut off for transfer will be 18:00 UTC on Tuesday due tomy trip to California on Wednesday.  Dividends will be paid again on Thursdaynight. Thanks for your patients as the work load has increased due to providing customerservice for VMC sales.Ken 
When you buy 96 base miners the space taken up is 384 U's, when you buy the 24.576 GH/s unit the space taken up is only 34 U's The base unit is a great buy now.  You should buy all you can. Great price on the Base unit at this time.  We are still in the process of engineering our board and our ASIC chip and do not have pictures yet.  eASIC is doing the engineering of our chip using their Fast Turnaround Process. I will work on getting that filled in. AMC is not registered in London, it is registered in Belize.  It just has a London address for mail. Send me a PM and I will sent the email for you. I will get them done today.  Super busy here now. I will be doing them in the morning. On bitfunder make sure you set the maximum price or it won't work. No, Working on it now. Sorry, I fixed it. I agree 100%. We are about a week behind on the Avalon prototypes, due to us having to get some bitcoins converted.  I was dragging my feet due to the price of bitcoin being $68 at the time.  Everything is looking good for the end of August for the Avalon clones.  Looks like our 20,000 chips are going to be about two weeks late from what I have read. I don't think I was bad mouthing the competition.  Yes, It does required a lot of power and cooling. See my post above. Yes, I would think so. The shares  now released are all that are necessary for the remaining funding that I have posted before.  The NRE, which I believe is the most important and most critical, to the success of the project has been funded.  The time to get this funded was also critical as eASIC has a ton of business for their 28nm design.  So to reach the NRE funding we used funds allocated to other uses and now need to make up that funding by offering the above shares, or by pre-order sales and payment for those sales.  This is a great time for the company and all of its shareholders. I am hoping that I do. Yes, and tbh I wonder how they are going to cool that big chip.  I can see why they are going to need liquid cooling.I am up for a good race. Yes, I had to dig for the information.  We will see how it turn out.Now, they can't beat this can they?  "World's Fastest Bitcoin Mining Machine" 24.576 TH/s. I don't know that it was incorrect, I checked their specifications in their thread.  The specifications in their threadshowed that their chip ran at a maximum of 10 GH/s.  They have not announced their chip in any kinda of PressRelease nor have they announced on the front of their website.  All they have done is put a little note in the backof their news releases.  Why have they not put it on their front page?
ActiveMining is a virtual identity totally owned by the Active Mining Corporation (Belize) that represents both itself and its profits. ActiveMining's business includes cryptocoin mining and sales of self-built ASIC devices through its wholly owned subsidiary Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC). Each of the 6 Ads has a different message. Maybe we should wait to see who gets to market first, they don't have it and we don't have it.  I am not so sure, that they will get that huge chip to market in the time frame they have announced. What they are is a Fab less Semiconductor company that has produced chips for Seagate Check out this article about the company that is making our chip eAsic which mentions major OEM customers i.e Seagate. Don't you know that we are trading Active Mining shares for AMC shares.  I have to issue those sharesto be able to trade for AMC shares. I like the way you think!   What makes you think we will be using TSMC? Maybe you should ask KnC not to lie to their customers:Is it 4 chips or is it 48 chips that makes their 400 GH/s?From their web site: Yes, we will have 28nm chips in a 12 week time frame after we approve our RTL code. Sure, as soon as I get something I can post.  Some of what we are doing is still under an NDA, so that limits what I can say or post.  In the next few weeks we willbe moving forward with this project as we now have the funds to pay the NRE to eAsic. I do not have a screenshot at this time. We have had our RTL code tested for feasibility to run on eASIC's chip.  The RTL code was found to be feasible and from the results we have an estimate of the speed of 16 GH/s and power of less than 12 watts per chip. I'm not thinking otherwise. Yes, I guess I have; however, I will try very hard to make it up to you and everyone else.  Let's see if I can do that is the next few weeks. I guess I could do that, but I am not going to, because what I want is for this to be successful, and walking away with the bucks would not make me feel like I was successful.  It would make me feel the opposite.  My main driving ambition is for this company to be very successful, not the money I will make from it; however, we do keep score by the amount of money the company makes and everyone else.  I am working very hard to make it successful.  I could have taken the easy route and plugged in the Avalon's and made ~$1,000 dollars a day and had plenty of money.  No, I decided to use my years of experience in business (I have been in business since I was 18) to create a company if we are lucky that could be the "World Leader In Manufacturing Bitcoin Machines And Mining Of Bitcoins".   I am not looking for a lots of money, I am looking to be successful, to make my customers successful, and to make my investors successful that is my driving goal.  "If you make your customers successful, then you will be successful".Kenneth E. Slaughter, CEO/CTOActive Mining Corporation I would be happy to put a board together as soon as we get over the next few months.  I would suggest a 7 member board. Keep talking about VMC good or bad!    In their specifications (which I have stored on my computer somewhere) their chip is listed at 10 GH/s, that is what I used to compare our chip to their chip. I will be posting 400,000 shares on BTC-TC @ .0025 and 100,000 shares on bitfunder @ .0025 sometime this weekend after the market has time to breath from the resent sales.
I have been very transparent.  I have said that we are issuing 500,000 more shares.  These will be spread between bitfunder and BTC-TC.  This is less than we had posted at first after the price of bitcoin went down to around $68.  At that point we added 1M shares, 500,000 on bitfunder and 500,000 on BTC-TC for a total of 4M shares, however because of the flippers bitfunder shares were not selling, so the wall was taken down after a post here.  Now that bitcoin has gone up we can sell less total shares which we are doing. Active Mining is only issuing 10M shares, that is all we can issue without a vote.  Most of AMC shares are owned by Active Mining. Yes, I don't mine doing that, however some on here disagreed with that.  I have said we need to sell 500,000 more shares.  I am only going to sell what is necessary, not one more share. @VolanicEruptor Go ahead and jump out, the last time you did that it cost you plenty.

No, due to the advice here. Thanks for the good advice. Just did a quick adding up of our funds.  Converted @ 93.40 we have ~$890,000, so I am going to add 500,000 shares to the wall.  We need funds to cover the 40-60 machines we are building, to finish paying for our prototypes, finish paying for the engineering of the prototypes, and some for general operating expenses.  Also, we need some room just in case the price of bitcoins goes down. Yes, working on moving those out.   Yes, those are the ones. When Active Mining is approved, BTC-TC can do an automatic tender. Yes, we will be doing something about that soon. Yes, I will try and get those done today, not that many now, but it does take a little time on each one. Adding a few more shares on bitfunder. Yes, we are getting close, but not there yet.  Also, need some over the NRE for the Avalon clone boards, remaining engineering, and balance for the prototypes.  We are just about to get over the hump.    Yes, just increased it a little.
Putting up a small wall on bitfunder at .0025. Great idea, I will try and get them to add it. There are no provisions for that at the moment.  I think when we get enough help, we would be able to do that in the future. AMC, ActiveMining, AMC-PT Dividends Paid. [.00000748/Share] AMC, Active Mining, AMC-PT Dividends Paid. [.00000748/Share] I will be taking down the wall on bitfunder, for dividends payments. No, I can't at the point. It will be announced in the this thread right before the wall goes down.Should we get a couple of more big sales and the wire transfers are received, then the wall could go down in an instance.

Yes It is not the Klondike boards, it is the Avalon clone boards for our 20,000 chips. We have just launched our Fast-Hash-One machines yesterday and already have sales of $62,799.00 so it is not going to take more than a week at this rate to have the NRE.  I have also talked to the Director of Sales and those 30 days were just our original estimate to them to get the funds. There is no fixed deadline, but of course we want to start producing chips asap. There is a limited availability of 230.4 TH/s of equipment, since our machines are very expandable we can not go bya certain number of machines.  No, indeed not.  We do need the ~1 million for the NRE; however, that is not required to keep the business running.  We have ~306 GH/s going live in about 3 weeks with our Klondike boards.  After that we have ~5,640 GH/s going live in about 6 weeks for a total of 6,346 GH/s.  Use a bitcoin profit calculator to see our cash flow after the next 6 weeks.  Getting the NRE will be icing on the cake. The coming expense is for production of our Avalon clone boards for our 20,000 chips coming in.  Also, we will need a place to house these machines when we get them built.  That expense has already been covered and is not in the above estimate.   Our Fast-Hash-One has 2 required components and one optional component:Required: Fast-Hash-One - 4U's - This is the base unit, and requires at least one hashing card to mine bitcoins.  This unit expands up to a total of 6 hashing cardsRequired: At least 1 Fast-Hash-One 256 GH/s Hashing Card containing 16 Fast-Hash-One 16 GH/s chips - $4,999 eachOptional: Expansion Case(s) - $9,999 each - 5U's - Expands up to 16 hashing cards and requires one slot in the base unit, up to 6 cases may be added to the base unitBase unit with 1 Fast-Hash-One 256 GH/s hashing card - $3,999.00
@lewicki Thank You.   Active Mining will have accounting, we are setting up our manufacturing software as we speak, this is different than AMC which only had basic accounting due to the fact that all it did was mine bitcoins and pay out dividends.  AMC in its description did not have provisions for any kind of advanced accounting.  FYI I made straight A's in accounting.  I also was hired and became the lead programmer on an accounting project.  We are having it built by http://www.easic.com @theymos I am ready to pay as soon as you pull the trigger. Fast-Hash-One shipping is October/November 2013 I will fix it right now, if I can find the error.Update: Fixed What page are you looking at?  I can't seem to find this error. Yes, all of our Fast-Hash series of machines are all self contained.  You do not need an expansion case, that is only needed if you want to expand past 6 cards. Cross Posted from the ActiveMining Thread.I will be getting all the transfers that are tendered before the cutoff time tomorrow done before dividends are paid tomorrow.This has been a very busy day, getting everything ready for our engineers to build our prototypes, launching our Fast-Hash-One machines,getting our Google ads running, etc. I will be getting all the transfers that are tendered before the cutoff time tomorrow done before dividends are paid tomorrow.This has been a very busy day, getting everything ready for our engineers to build our prototypes, launching our Fast-Hash-One machines,getting our Google ads running, etc. Thanks for helping me out.  I changed the wording to "Requires you to select at least ONE hashing card" is that more clear?So, buy the $3,999 unit, it is at a special price.  The modules will get cheaper over time.  You need to select the number of hashing cards you want from the drop down box.From The Shopping Cart:When you purchase the machine as a unit the hashing cards are cheaper.  We are engineering the boards at the present time and do not have pictures available.

I like your thinking.   ~10,000 @ $100 Bitcoins.  However, we have had a lot of expenses in July getting our Prototypes built (Engineering NRE and Deposits) , plus paying for theassembly of the 68 Klondike boards.  Also, having to exchange bitcoins @ $68 to pay some expenses did not help any. AMC Accounting For The Month Of June:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=158806.msg2737065#msg2737065  Thanks for reminding me.    Since AMC's description did not allow for any purchase of account software, we were just doing the very basic form of accounting. Also, since AMC is being merged into AMC (Belize) (Virtual shares ActiveMining) we will be issuing a full accounting statement on the winding down of AMC's business and its merger into ActiveMining on completion of the merger.  Our Plans For Shares and the NRE:When we reach our goal of funding for the NRE from any of the following sources (shares sales, machine sales, chip sales, private funding, mining, loans etc) with a bit of leeway for other expenses, I will make a post here in the thread and then take down the wall immediately. It is not going to be a pass-thru, as the offering allows shares to be traded on different exchanges.  The limit is only 10,000,000 can be issued at any one time over all the exchanges. Did you click on the links and read the description? BTC-TC Business Plan:================================================================Mission Statement:"Make Our Customer And Investor Successful, Then The Company Will Be Successful" Our goal as a merged company is 1) To create the "World Largest Bitcoin Mining Farm"  2) To be the #1 Manufacture of bitcoin mining machines in the world.Growth & Potential:Manufacturing Business (VMC)VMC expects to sell 921.6 TH/s of mining equipment in the Next 12 months.Mining Business (AMC Belize)AMC expects to build the "World Largest Bitcoin Mining Farm" using its own developed 28nm ASIC "World Fastest Bitcoin Mining Chip" with our partner http://www.eASIC.Com using their Fast Turnaround Process.The mining business expects to be mining in the next 24 months with this amout of hashing power:Total Bitcoin Mining Equipment hashing power by March 2015 (992,384,000 MH/s * 992,384 GH/s * 992.384 TH/s)The global ActiveMining's income, including mining income, hardware sales via bitcoins, other cryptocoins and fiat transferred to bitcoins, will be paid to ActiveMining shareholders proportionally, after all manufacturing, maintenance, labor costs, R&D, growth and miscellaneous expenses are deducted.This is a contiuation of the Active Mining Cooperative mining business listed here:https://bitfunder.com/asset/AMC click on Profile->Description.And adding to that business Virtual Mining Corporation's business listed here:http://www.virtualminingcorp.com Yes, I can do that. 7 @ 7.25 I don't Very Very Sharp!     Nice, Thanks. Yes, why? No, as it has to be approved first.   It has to be approved by the admin, before it shows as pending. Update:Klondike progress: As many of you are aware, the Klondike has now been tested with 16 chips hashing at 4gh/s on the older test board...... Final PCB design will be completed within the next 24 hours and sent to the fab houses for production. Component sourcing:We are working with both US and oversees PCB fab houses in order to reduce manufacturing lead time so all components are ready prior to chip arrival. The BOM has been purchased, and parts have begun arriving at the assembly house. All parts should be in and ready for assembly by next week. ActiveMining (AMC) have 68 Klondike boards on order. You create a reserve account for refunds.  Like 10%, or whatever percentage you think you will have in returns. ACTIVEMINING created on BTC-TC waiting for admin approval.
ACTIVEMINING created on BTC-TC waiting for admin approval. It is only one strategy out of four, of which any one could fund the NRE, or part of each could fund the NRE. Met with babefoot for about 3 1/2 hours today.  Meeting was very good as he ask a lot of questions which he will report on. The wall was not working to get the NRE for us.  Getting ready to launch a big advertising campaign which I feel will get the NRE. Off to the meeting with babefoot. BTC-TC trading will be coming soon, if approved. I will be changing the wall in ActiveMining to ~100,000 shares. I will be changing the wall in ActiveMining to around ~100,000 shares. I want to link my Bitcointalk name with BTCJam's.

This is all part of the merger process. That might work, lot of things going on in the background that could knock this wall down quick.

Everyone should be fixed now, starting to work on the dividends.PM me if your shares are not fixed and you tendered before 19:00 UTC today. Hold on, it is going to get a lot better. Yes these are low as we are starting up.  However this is still 13% APR at the Initial IPO price.  Then, with that return you have a chance for a lot bigger returns in the future.  Now with Active Mining that goes up 4X to ~52% APR.  You are taken care of. All Bitfunder transfers through 19:00 UTC today have been completed. Yes, I agree, I don't want to profit from this.  However, it is a manner of logistics.  I will try and push the shares back to your account so you can receive dividends. Cross Post from the AMC ThreadEveryone should be transferred through the dividends cutoff time of 1PM CDT.  If you are transfering onBitfunder or if you are on BTCT.CO and transfering to Bitfunder ActiveMining then all these should be done.Please PM me if you have not received your shares in the above cases.Those on BTCT.CO that have tendered their shares are in a holding bin until we can create a asset on BTCT.CO andget approved.  If you would like me to push your shares back to you please send me a PM.

We will factor in all profits from sales and mining into the dividend pay-out.  We plan on give very detailed reports also. Sorry, for taking so long. I plan on paying dividends and a lot of them.  I want to make all the Investors in AM very successful, because if the Investors are successful I will be successful. Sorry, I did not mean to insult anyone.  We have manufacturing accounting software and will use theGenerally accepted accounting principles to determine when the revenue is earned.  When that happensit will reflect on the bottom line as profit or loss.  Then at that time we will pay a dividend if there isa profit. We will be using the following:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_generally_accepted_accounting_principlesAnd This:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accrual_basis_accountingAnd This:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_recognition Good deal. 7 @ 6.25 $32,791 Of Our Fast-Hash-One Machines Sold so far today. Dividends will be paid sometime tomorrow this week due to the transfers. Yes, everyone will get dividends as long as they tendered by 1PM CDT which is the cut-off time for dividends.The dividends paid to AM from AMC will be paid out. I am sorry, but I took a zero off.   Just kidding. Working on these, I am being very careful not to make any mistakes, so it is a slow process.
Yes, the dividends will be at least what the AMC dividends are.  Trying to get to the BTC-TC filing, lot to do here with these transfers. We have sold our first Fast-Hash-One machines.     Yes, I am working on that.  Cutoff for tendering the shares and getting dividends on the new AM shares is 1:00 PM CDT today. Working on any shares that we put in the hold bin for any reason, those should be transferred this morning.Cut off time for tendering shares and being transferred before dividends are paid is 1:00 PM CDT today. 7 @ 5.5 What proof do you have? 7 @ 5 7 @ 2.5 They can't use any of our IP.Good Luck putting in an order.  You don't know what I had to go through to get them to this place.  They have so much business, they grew 980% last year. PM Me and I will check on it.  Should be done in 24 hours, unless something is wrong and was put in the holding bin.

Verify queue down to zero, as of this time, transferring shares now on bitfunder.  BTC-TC will be next.  Yes, let's be honest we are going to build these and when we do, how may of those 10 GH/s miners will it take to make 1 of these, the answer is 2,457 and these will use a lot less power to boot. At the moment you can only transfer AMC-PT to a bitfunder account.  We will be applying for ActiveMining to betraded on BTC-TC, if and when approved, they have an automatic system for transferring the shares. There are plenty of shares left as of this writing.  You can purchase the shares on bitfunder.com asset ActiveMining or you can purchase AMC shares on bitfunder and tender them or you can purchase AMC-PT on BTC-TC and tender them. Taking a short break from doing the transfers, the queue is about 6 hours behind right now. Yes Thanks, never thought of that, changed the post above, adding your suggestion. I am going to work on that later tonight.  Soon as everything settles down. @TAT  Whatever this is, it is going to be a lot bigger that ASICMINER.I don't think ASICMINER has one of these: 24.576 TH/s, 6 Expansion Cases,  96 256 GH/s boards.http://axs.net/AMC/HighEnd.png New Thread for Active Mining Discussion.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=252531.0 AMC To ActiveMining Tender Offer Announcementhttps://bitfunder.com/asset/ActiveMining Profile->DescriptionWe are offering a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 10,000,000 AM Virtual shares of our Active Mining Corporation a Belize International Business Company ( AMC Belize) Shares (the "AMC Belize Shares") in exchange for  minimum of 1 and a maximum of 10,000,000 Active Mining Cooperative (AMC Cooperative) AMC Virtual Shares (the AMC Cooperative Shares) on a one(1) for one(1) exchange.

Both original contract proposals were quite complex, so we decided to rip them apart and start from scratch, using the same tried and tested model of Asicminer. This allows for a much needed flexibility that is key in the bitcoin world.What happens to the Active Mining Cooperative (AMC) now?Existing AMC (BitFunder) and AMC-PT (BTC-TC) shareholders get the benefit of being able to tender their shares for ActiveMining shares, getting all the benefits of new hardware sales and the shareholder's protection program of BTC0.0025/share, on top of their current mining profits. After existing AMC ask walls are sold (around 4,000,000 shares) and 90% of existing AMC shareholders tender their shares to ActiveMining, AMC starts on a liquidation process, to be fully absorbed into ActiveMining.How can I tender my existing AMC or AMC-PT shares for ActiveMining shares?Details on this process will be available shortly. Where can I buy ActiveMining shares?Currently, there are two ways for that:You can buy ActiveMining shares directly from https://bitfunder.com/asset/ActiveMining (BitFunder). We are also working on getting ActiveMining approved on BTC-TC;You can buy existing AMC shares (https://bitfunder.com/asset/AMC) or (https://btct.co/security/AMC-PT), and then tender them for ActiveMining shares once the details are published.What is the Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC)?VMC is a subsidiary of ActiveMining that is in charge of building hardware. Think of it as a department of ActiveMining, with all its profits funneled into ActiveMining shareholders.So, where can I see the current ActiveMining hashrate and mining profits?Currently ActiveMining mines on BTC Guild at around 430GH/s, as User 211435 and as Team AMC. Accumulated mining profits are stored in BTC address 1DJpsvnM7xTnQbWEhLYyCyfxQyxwupEzCa. Here's a graph of that.What are the current plans for chip development?ActiveMining is in the process of gathering necessary funds for paying NRE costs on its 28nm chip. We hope these funds to be gathered soon, so that chip production can start as soon as possible. Estimated dates after NRE payment are:Chip samples delivered in 9 weeks;Low-volume chip production starting in 12 weeks, using an e-beam process;Normal volume chip production starting in 16-18 weeks.What happens if there aren't enough funds for the 28nm NRE?There are several solutions for that. The current and incoming mining hardware should be able to cover that risk and there is still the option of going 45nm where the NRE cost is about half of the 28nm process.Can you please provide some documents as proof of the existing claims?Engineering Firm quote for the machines that will host the incoming Avalon chips: http://axs.net/AMC/SB-Prototype-Quote.jpgeASIC chip NDA: http://axs.net/AMC/eAsic-NDA0001.jpg and http://axs.net/AMC/eAsic-NDA0002.jpg ActiveMining: A Fresh Start!IntroductionActiveMining is a virtual identity totally owned by the Active Mining Corporation (Belize) that represents both itself and its profits. ActiveMining's business includes cryptocoin mining and sales of self-built ASIC devices through its wholly owned subsidiary Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC).Currently, it is expected for interested ActiveMining's public investors to hold 10,000,000 ActiveMining shares (40% of the profits), while Active Mining Corporation owner(s) shall hold 15,000,000 ActiveMining shares (60% of the profits), for a total of 25,000,000 ActiveMining virtual shares that represent 100% of the global profits of ActiveMining.The issuing of more ActiveMining shares can be allowed in the future, as a last resort measure and after a shareholder's vote, provided there is strong economic justification, mainly on the basis of covering emergent capital needs. Existing shareholders also get the first choice for buying new shares before they are sold on the open market. The volume of new shares shall be kept at a minimum as much as possible and the pricing of them should be such that the total value of all ActiveMining's assets (tangible and intangible) per ActiveMining share does not diminish, protecting shareholders as much as possible from future dilution of value.Public investor's protection planThe first 10,000,000 ActiveMining shares have the privilege of getting all profits until BTC0.0025/share is paid, starting from the day when dividends begin to be paid.How to buy sharesActiveMining shares will be sold on BitFunder and BTCT.CO and any other exchange, following asset approval or tendered by AMC shares. Existing Active Mining Cooperative (AMC) shareholders will be entitled to tender their shares for ActiveMining shares, on a 1:1 basis and are also covered in the public investor's protection plan.Dividend paymentThe global ActiveMining's income, including mining income, hardware sales via bitcoins, other cryptocoins and fiat transferred to bitcoins, will be paid to ActiveMining shareholders proportionally, when all manufacturing, maintenance, labor costs, R&D, growth and miscellaneous expenses are deducted. The first BTC0.0025/share dividends will only be paid to the first 10,000,000 ActiveMining shares, providing public investors a priority in getting back 100% return of their investment.Our chips in developmentGeneration 1: Fast-Hash. 28nm. Each chip's rated frequency is 800 MHz at 1.15V. It translates to 16,000 MH/s because it does 20 hashes per cycle. Chip requires proper handling of heat and power supply. It is expected the chip can be overclocked to 1000 MHz @ 20,000 MH/s."Our existing hardware assets from AMC liquidation6 Avalon miners, currently running on BTC Guild under "Team AMC" for around 430 GH/s;An order of Avalon chips from steamboat's batch #1, for 68 Klondike-16 boards, rated at 68*16*282 = 307 GH/s;An order of 20,000 Avalon chips (end of May and beginging of June orders), for a combined hashrate of 20,000*282 = 5,640 GH/s.In total, around 6,377 GH/s, expected to be fully operational in the middle of August.

This is the virtual world not the real world. The 1-for-1 swap will be a transfer on the exchange.  It will be a manual process, so it will be very time consuming. Well, since bitfunder does it over all the issued shares it will be over 10 million, however the dividends from the unsold shares will go into the pot for the next weeks dividends.     ============================================================================================================================ActiveMining: A Fresh Shart!Version Final 7/8/13============================================================================================================================IntroductionActiveMining (AM) is a virtual identity totally owned by the Active Mining Corporation (Belize) that represents both itself and its profits.

Yes, I agree. Yes, all I was saying was that the cost of electricity would be less than what the machines are making,  Of course, that is at the current difficulty.  Thanks for your support.  I intend to keep all the shareholder informed, as we have in the past.  In the next phase, I am expecting the work load to increase and it make take some time before we can increase the number of employees to meet this increased work load.  So, that updates may a little more spaced out. Yes, it is a complex relationship with bitcoin.  However, I have checked and we would still be profitable @ $5.00 bitcoins. To keep the contract simple, I don't think we need to put that in.  At the moment we have limited amount of time to be on the board, as we are trying to get a number of things put together.  I for one will be flying to our Engineering firm to flash the prototypes in about a week.  Should we get eASIC paid the NRE, I will be working with them in California to the the RTL perfect with 20 hashing engines.  So, there is a lot to do. However, ever since we have started AMC we have put out a number of Press Releases, so much that Ukto on bitfunder limited us to one per week. Yes, that is coming, I am on vacation until tomorrow.  So a few things need to be set up first. When the current shareholders swap their shares for AMC (Belize) then if fully taken up, then the current shareholders will own 40% of the merge co.Management, has invested in the 6 Avalon's, which were purchased in February 2013. These Avalon's are currently producing between 14-6 bitcoins per day.  At the current value ofbitcoins this give them a value @ a 5% capitalization rate of $2,482,000 using 50% of the revenue.  Of course this all depends on the difficulty and the exchange rate for bitcoins.AMC will be publishing reports before the 15th of July.   ~6 Million shares have been issued.  There will be no more shares to issue, however the contract does allow us to issue more if needed. This is the full contract to keep it simple.  However, if the community wants more details added, I can do that.   None of that is in the contract/offering to keep it simple.  However, I would do what was in the really complex offering after this is all worked out. ============================================================================================================================VMC/AMC MergerThis is a Pre-Merger VMC Offering.

I have been a lurker from 2009 until March 2013, registered in 2010 and did 2 post, so I know where you are coming from.  Well, things are starting to come around, we are doing exactly what we said we would and we will continue to do that.  After a while it gets harder and harder for the slanders to come up with anything. No, It was a mistake, and BTC-TC shares got overpaid.  This will be corrected in the future, however we are not taking back the dividends that where overpaid toBTC-TC shareholders. Should AMC provide VMC with the NRE  then AMC will receive at manufacturerscost the first 100 Fast-Hash-One fully loaded machines.  The availablity date hasbeen moved up to the end of October, due to the fact that using eASIC's Low Volume Production these chips can be available in about 12 weeks.These machines are rated at 24.576 TH/s maximum, so this would be a total of2,457.6 TH/s.  Now to get all of these machines AMC would need considerableresources to pay for these.  However, this is the maximum number andAMC could purchase less than the maximum depending on their availablefunds.  AMC will also receive 70% of the profit from bulk chips sales.eASIC Fast Turn Around ASIC: http://www.easic.com/high-speed-transceivers-low-cost-power-fpga-nre-asic-45nm-easic-nextreme-2/easic-nextreme-2-fast-turnaround-asics-manufacturing/  Yes, that option is available to VMC, however I don't see VMC purchasing a large number of shares, as most of VMC's effort will be going into selling machines.  While most of AMC's effort will be going into building its mining farm.  The main reason for the swap is so that enough shares of AMC will be sold to allow VMC to pay the NRE.  Of course AMC will get the NRE paid back.   I don't think that is going to happen, AMC will continue to exist for a long time to come.  Even if the 10M shares where all swapped for VMC shares, AMC still has more to offer and will continue to grow.  The only difference will be that some of the revenue from AMC will flow into VMC.  I think it is a win for AMC and a win for VMC.   This is really not a stock split, it is a swap, 1 share of AMC for 1 share of VMC when approved for trading.  The option owner are placing there bets and it up to them to guess right on the timing.  As an option trader myself I understand their concerns. Yes, that is the way it would work.  The 10 Million shares represent a 10% division of profits in AMC.  If the 10 Million shares are swapped for VMC shares the10 Million shares would represent a 40% true ownership in VMC.  Also VMC will receive income from mining and from sales. No, the BF dividends are right. Yes, check the BTC-TC details, however this is not a fast process.  Right now it may take 2-3 weeks to get the shares transferred, as we areworking on a number of other things.   The dividends on bitfunder was the correct one, next week we will issue the correct dividend on BTC-TC. I think what happen is that the BTC-TC dividends work different than bitfunder.  On bitfunder the dividends are divided between allissues shares which includes all shares issued.  BTC-TC must have spread the dividend to only the shares that have sold.Next week the dividend will be correct on BTC-TC to account for this.   I really don't know how it will play out, but shareholders which decide to not swap will continue to receive their dividends for the foreseeable future.  I think there wii be a market for the shares Everything is right.  The only thing is that AMC will continue to exist for those that do do want to swap there shares.
The market will determine the price of the shares.  However since there are only 25M shares instead of 100M you will be getting 4X  more of the company.  Also now you own a manufaturer and a mining company. It is 1 share of AMC for 1 share of VMC. So the price would be whatever price you purchased your AMC shares [VMC/AMC] Merger This is a Pre-Merger VMC Offering.

Synthesized it's Bitcoin Mining source code to create RTL for the xc6xlt150 FPGA.  VMC has hadthe code ported to eASIC Nextreme-2 family of ASIC chips.  eASIC will then close timing on the designfor the ASIC chip.  After timing closure, Prototype and Low Volume production of the ASIC chips will begin.High volume production of the chip will begin in 3-6 months after the project starts.After production begins, the ASIC chips can be delivered to VMC in a 3 to 6 month time frame.  VMC will-atthe same time-start the high production process for 28nm chip using eASIC's easicopy process which takesas little as 12 months.  VMC has also received licenses on Printed Circuit Board (PCB) designs forxc6xlt150 FPGA Boards.  VMC has hired an Electronic Engineering and Manufacturing Services to designthe PCB boards for its Fast_Hash series of bitcoin mining machines.  VMC may purchase Bitcoin Mining Chipsor PCB from other vendors if available for its machines.

AMC Dividends Have Been Paid 0.00000139/share It does have the ~ = Approximate. I will be adding 500,000 shares to each of the walls at Bitfunder and BTC-TC. This is due to the drop in the price of Bitcoins.  For AMC coming mergerwith VMC, more details later today. Update On Our 68 Klondike Boards.Just paid for our assembly of our 68 Klondike boards. These all together are ~306,000 MH/s or about equal to 5 of the Avalon machines we have now.This would bring our total hashing power up to 700,000+ MH/s It looks like we could get these within the next 3-4 weeks. Yes Yes, we have decided to use BFL chips in our Fast-Hash-XXX series of machines.  So yes, thank you very much. Sorry, but the security is very high.  It is going to take about 10 days for us to get all of paperwork, badges, and Ids, so thatwe can move the equipment there. Here is the link to Springnet, the data-center inside Springfield Underground.http://www.springnetunderground.net/assets/main.html Thanks!     It will be as soon as I can get everything put together.  However, I am going to take a few days off for the 4th.  Going down to Branson for a few days.  It will still be a working vacation as there are few details we will have to wrap up on Friday concerning our Avalon clone prototypes. Yes, this is a good idea, I will keep it in mind. When we put out the 2M shares, the price was above our ask. We are going to try and keep that from happening, however shareholders will need to consider that they are getting a whole new business plus keeping AMC's business too when they swap their shares for VMC's shares. It is not the number of shares, having a large number of shares does not diluted anything.  The only thing it does is make the pie have a lot more smaller pieces.  So, when our shares started trading at .0005 with 40,000,000 shares issued and you bought 1 BTC worth, then that would be 2,000 shares.  If we had started trading with 4,000,000 shares issued at .005 and you bought 1 BTC you would have got 200 shares, same difference.  The only difference is you have 2,000 pieces or you have 200 pieces, and the same percentage of ownership. VMC will have a 7 member board of directors to run the company, this will be setup just like a normal corporation.  Each share will represent ownership inthe company. My thinking right now is to reduce my ownership from 100% down to 60% Nice, to have you back in the thread.
I think I can get it done quick, we need to, due to the eASIC deal, they are going to want a lot of money soon.  I have already been working on a standalone VMC offering.  So, It will not take to much more time to add the swap rules into the offering.  What takes a lot of time is the projection of sales, expenses, and the resultant profit. Most likely we don't have 2-3 months to do anything in this fast paced Bitcoin manufacturing world. 1.) Let me clear this up for AMC shareholders, I will never freeze the shares.  I may twist your arm to trade your shares for VMC, but I will never force anything on you.2.) Dividends will continue for AMC unless VMC owns 100% of the shares of AMC.3.) There might be a time limit on swapping shares.Let me know what you think about the above.  I think the above would be fair to everyone, those that want to be part of VMC and those that want to stay in AMC. I don't want to force any AMC shareholders into any thing they don't want and I won't.  I may twist there arms a little.   Great, You guys keep the ideas coming, I am going to bed as I have to get up early tomorrow and meet with my management team.  Yes, this is what I am thinking would happen. Yes, that might happen.  Might not be a bad thing as AMC needs to raise capital fast to pay the NRE soon. Yes, very much like the AMC offering, but different in the fact VMC has employees, and a lot of operating expenses which have to be paid to operate. I have already been working on a VMC offering and it has that in it already.  Learn a little from the AMC offering. Ok, I will keep this in mind. Still gets paid its 10% no problem. It doesn't have to.  The more it owns the better, but I don't see any reason it would have to own 100%.  Over timeas it makes money it could purchase more and more of AMC shares.  Do this make since? I don't know how VMC can purchase AMC shares at .0025?  Tell me how to do that please. No problem, they stay in AMC as long as they want.  We do not force anyone to move their shares to VMC.AMC keeps trading, it is just a chance for those that want to get into the selling of equipment to get into VMC. Yes it does, however I would have to think of a way to do that.  Need some time to think this over. Just came up with this idea, so I have not had time to think about price.  You make a very good point here. That will not work!  I am sorry.   Ok, I create a VMC offering, AMC shareholder can exchange 1 share of AMC for 1 share of VMC.  After the exchange period VMC will continue whenpossible to purchase AMC shares on the open market until it has acquired all of AMC's shares.  How does that sound? The 10,000 BTC is needed for eASIC's NRE to create the Fast-Hash-One 28nm 16 GH/s chip. Good question.  Yes, we should create a way for AMC shareholder to convert their shares to VMC shares.  Is this what you are asking?
Yes, VMC would start purchasing AMC shares until it has all of them. Well, we got rid of all the FUDsters.  Could not do anything with them here, seems like they have all left. I just came up with an idea to solve this problem.I will create an VMC offering, then VMC will purchase AMC.  There you have it that is the solution.  Tell me what you think.  I do not quite know what you are saying here, could you re-phrase it. I own very little of the 40,000,000 shares released, only some that I bought because I has 7 BTC floating around and then I bought some this last weekend to support the price, this was in my private account.  Somewhere south of 50,000 shares. You mean a fee?  No there is no fee on dividends. Yes, I am very high on AMC, so I now would get the dividends on my shares, right? Well, first let get down to salary, I am not getting one now, but I would like to get one.  What is the pay? Yes, me too. Ok, Let say we merge AMC and VMC, who is going to run it? This isn't listed on BTCT.CO There are no provisions in the description for changing it, also bitfunder.com has no provisions for motions or anything else like that.  The description is a contract between each and every shareholder.  Now if we could get each and every shareholder to agree to the change, then I think we could do it. I don't know of anyway to do it, except the one above. Yes, if the description could be changed, the this would be set to yes.  I other words, the description does not haveany provisions for the description to be changed. No, I am say that the description on bitfunder.com can not be changed.  It is a contract between the issuer and shareholders.  The only way to change it would be to close the company and liquidate it and then do a new offering. Can't change the description, it is a contract and their are not provisions in the contract to change it. First, it was me who asked that question. Second, why *can't* AMC do this? I mean, if you're running VMC (and according to http://www.virtualminingcorp.com/about.html, you are), then surely you have all the infrastructure (staff, contacts, distribution systems etc etc etc) all up and running anyway? So if that's the case, and it must be since VMC is your planned chip seller, and you're the CEO of VMC, then why couldn't you do this? [/quote]So let me ask again, How is AMC going to pay for all of this? New Section 5 in the FAQ's5) So, how can AMC be valued since shares do not directly represent ownership, but profits?You can use a simple conversion for it: [#investor's_shares * current_price], with [1 - #investor's_shares/40M] (%) of dividends being kept for reinvestment.Using current values (2nd July 2013), there are ~6M shares sold to investors and ~34M in the growth/expansion fund. At a price of 0.001, AMC is valued at 6M*0.001 = BTC6000, with 1-6/40 = 85% of dividends being kept for reinvestment. I am not saying that it can't be done.  I am saying that the description of the offering of AMC makes it impossible to do. Here is why AMC can not sell the chips.  There are no provisions for employees, unless you hire 4 at the same time.  There are no provisions for any kind of sales expenses one you hire the 4 employees.  There are no provisions for any kinda of hosting services.  There are no provisions for hiring someone to develop a website to sell the chips.  Even if you hired the 4 employees, the expenses are limited to a 10% maximum.  So please tell me how this would be done. 
Let me just ask you  a simple question.  How would AMC sells chips itself?  Explain to me how that would be done? I don't know if my address has been on here before, but I posted my complete address, including my cell phone number with the Avalon Orders on Bitfunder back in March.  However, a scammers got my order number and tried to sell my Avalon's on eBay, so I had to redact the address.  I was trying to be as transparent as I could back in March.   The NDA was signed over a month ago on May 17th.  We just rented the office/manufacturing site on June 5, 2013.  You have to understand that weare moving forward with our plan and that things are changing on a daily basis. Sure, that would be fine. Would love to meet up with both of you.  I will buy lunch and then we can go over and look at our new manufacturing site.  However, we are just getting startedputting together the manufacturing line, so there is not really that much to see at this point.  You would see that we do have a site rented, and that we are setting upthe office, getting security in place.  Also, we are starting to get in an inventory of cases and power supplies.  Just let me know when you want to do this. I would be happy to meet with you, if you drive over. I already have the power,  however I do not use it, because I believe in free speech.  However some users of the thread were complaining about all the trash talk, so I decided to do a poll.  Just doing the poll caused some users of the thread to delete some of their post and clean up the thread some.  I have only removed two post in this thread due to explicit profanity being used. Yes, this is a good idea, we don't have a sign yet, as we are still setting up.  Just received an order of cases and power supplies last week.  So we are getting there, just installed a security system also. [AMC] Hardware discussion and F.A.Q.So, what do shares represent? Ownership?Shares do not represent ownership, they are "solely a distribution mechanism for rights to profits", and used as a means to liquidation.Wait a minute... I'm not "owning" a part of AMC, just a piece of the "profits" Welcome to the bitcoin stock exchange game. Learn the risks, and stay, or get out. Please read https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=245713.msg2616979#msg2616979So, shares represent a part of profits then. How are they distributed?Until at least May 2014, on the initial 40M, a minimum of 20M are retained for growth and expansion and a maximum of 20M can be sold to investors.In May 2014, or when 0.0005 is payed by share, whichever happens later, an extra 60M are created, for the final total of 100M. On these remaining 60M, a minimum of 20M are retained for growth and expansion and a maximum of 40M can be sold to investors, with a 40M being retained by AMC/Ken.So, I heard I am earning a lot from AMC right now, by bagging the dividends from all the unsold shares out of the 40M?Wrong. The contract specifies that all dividends from issued shares still on AMC's hands are retained by the growth and expansion fund (the contract was originally written using correct terminology, but BF considers all shares "issued").The first time I get a piece of the pie will be after a year of work (May 2014), when the rest of the 60M are issued. At that time, more 20M can be sold to investors, and I retain the remaining 40M.I've read a lot of announcements, but have yet to see real documents. Can you please provide some?Engineering Firm quote for Avalon machines: http://axs.net/AMC/SB-Prototype-Quote.jpgeASIC NDA: http://axs.net/AMC/eAsic-NDA0001.jpg and http://axs.net/AMC/eAsic-NDA0002.jpgSo, how will the division between AMC and VMC be implemented, in respect to chip/machine sales?Roughy, AMC takes care of the chips, VMC takes care of the machines:- AMC develops the chip, pays the chip's NRE and sells the chip in bulk to customers (using VMC as intermediary).- VMC uses AMC's chip (or any other chips) and builds bitcoin miners, paying a royalty cost to AMC whenever its IP is used.Chip sales: AMC holds IP rights on the Fast-Hash-ONE chips, so AMC contracts with VMC the following services: (a) the representation services to negotiate chip production with eASIC and (b) the re-selling of AMC's chips in bulk. AMC also guarantees chip exclusivity to VMC, so that AMC won't negotiate a chip supply contract to any other bitcoin systems manufacturer. AMC gets 70% back from the profits on the sale of bulk chips, while VMC gets 30%. All of VMC's expenses, including representation, chip stock management and re-shipping expenses to final customers are taken from their 30% profit.System sales: AMC also allows VMC to buy chips directly from eASIC at the lowest cost, for the manufacturing of bitcoin mining systems. On every sale of these systems or parts of it that contain AMC chips or IP, AMC receives a 10% royalty fee from the total gross sales revenue. Example: if a customer purchases a system for ฿100, AMC receives ฿10, whatever the profit margins for VMC are. My web developer developed those site and those site are running on top of my developed "Turn Key Web Hosting Business". We are in the process of compiling a FAQ's which should be written on Monday and posted soon after that.  It may need to be reviewed and rewritten before it is posted.  I am going to post that in the reserved post that I have at the beginning of the thread.  That way if anyone ask a question that is answered in the FAQ's we can point them to that message. At the momeent shareholder are getting 50% of the profit. Yes, I understand some of the raised issues could have been better formulated in the original contract. My intention is not to rip off anyone, but to build value for AMC's shareholders. I am open to any thoughtful changes on how to proceed for making any necessary adjustments. I have created a poll, to ask users of this thread whether I should delete post that are not discussing the merits of AMC.  Please vote on this poll.  ~40 Million shares  I own and I am not going to sell.  20 million shares that AMC owns which will be used to build the mining farm even bigger that it will be in 10 monthsof growth. Yes, but only after the next 10 months have expired, right now only 40,000,000 shares are receiving dividends.  So, let's value the company at the current number of shares issued. That is not the case, I am building AMC into a world class bitcoin mining farm, which all long term investors will receive profit from. The dividends are going to be paid as required in the description.  lewicki has updated his post to reflect this. I have been on this board as a lurker since 2009, I only registered in 2010 to make those post.  I have a lot more to do than post, so that is why there were on two post in 2010.  Also I was developing another product for about two years.  I decided to look back into bitcoin in early 2012 and seen that the price was $6.50.  I then started putting all my resources from a contract IT Job into GPU mining equipment.  I then took most all of the bitcoins mined in 2012-2013 and purchased the 6 Avalon's.  I then found bitfunder, put together an offer, seen that it took off, however had some problems with Avalon's quick announcement of their batch 3 sales and made some misstates in my offering because of the rush to get it together before the batch 3 sales.  So as it turns out, I had to pay back all of the cash to the first investors which I did plus a small dividend as AMC made a small profit on G.ASICMINER-PT dividends and the sales of G.ASICMINER-PT shares.  So, this is where the idea of VMC began,  you could not count on other manufactures to deliver there products on time or to even continue producing their product. i.e. Avalon  So VMC was created to provide AMC with a stable supply of bitcoin mining machines.  So the offering was rewritten to cover all the complaints of the community in the first offering adding VMC as the manufacture to supply AMC with machines at manufacturers cost (Want to offer the machines to AMC free, but I could not figure out a way to do that).  So this is the story of how we got to this point.  I think the future is very bright for AMC, having it's own supply of machines, having it's own chip for those machines, and maybe it's own underground data-center which is unlike most other data-centers which require some time during the year for down time, this data-center does not require any down time for maintenance.   Nice to hear from you again Entropy-uc, since you are a competitor as you say above with the 10 Avalon's you own, we must be doing something right to make you worry so much.  I do have to point out that nowhere have I said that we are not going to pay dividends to shareholders.  That is the nice thing about VMC is we are going to be building our own machines for AMC, 40 for August 31, 2013 and then ~22 for September.
Show me a link where they say there chips is 100 GH/s.  I think there board with multiple chips is 100 GH/s.   We do not need to sale any more shares to fund the chip, see spreadsheet below: Changed the number of shares to correct amount above. We have just commited to 2 Full Racks of space at http://www.springfieldunderground.com/ after a tour this morning.  We have also reserved put a 2nd reservation on 2 more racks.Check out the link above you would not believe this place.  It will take about 10 days to get everything in place and get the Avalon's moved to there new home. Yes, I did it out of frustration and I apologize, since my expertise is engineering, I am still learning the ins and out of the Bitcoin stock market.  The sell order is not going away until sold or until it's not needed anymore due to mining profits.  I commit to announcing in this thread before any share price movements in the future.I did add a few more shares that were in the account as I did not know the exact amount of shares when I canceled the sell order.  If anyone remembers the exact amount, I'll re-list them as that. Also AMC has a stable source of supply of Bitcoin Mining Machine. The difference is if it was a loan you would only get the 10% on the balance of the loan.  With the 10% royalty you get the NRE paid back and you still get 10% on all the sales.  This is a big difference. We are on schedule to receive 62 of these machine by the end of August.  We have 20,000 chips on order fromAvalon for these machines.Now, I think you are a competitor just trying to spread FUD about AMC, I have looked at some of yourpost and you seem to be tied to KnC as your forum name suggest "TheSwede75". and this:[Group Buy #2] 1 KNC Miner Saturn 175 GH/s miner + hosting (10 shares) CLOSEDwhich is your group buy for KNC equipment.  Case Closed. Check out my post here that answers the above concerns:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=158806.msg2598608#msg2598608 No, the chips spec say a maximum of 10 GH/s, AMC chips is 16 GH/s no one comes close. Here you go:  No the profit calculation in the contract is based on a 40 times increase in the difficulty in the next 25 months.  Also, there is a growth and expansion fund which receives 50% of the revenue for the next ~10 Months to purchase more mining equipment to keep up and exceed the difficulty raise.I guess that is true, however AMC gets machines at manufacturers cost, so the profit on those machine will be zero and AMC has a lot of rights to machines over the next year or so.Yes, this has happened before, due to the Bitfunder "God" Ukto forcing AMC to sale shares at .0005 when the market price was .0008.For the next ~10 months the shares represents 1/40,000,000 of the profits due to 60,000,000 not being issued and thus not receiving any dividends at all.The contract can not be changed.  There can not be anymore than 100,000,000 shares issued.VMC was created to give AMC a stable source of Bitcoin Mining Machines, due to the likes of BFL, Avalon, KnC, etc having pre-orders, not delivering in a timely way, etc.I am funding VMC's business which is hardware sales, AMC is funding the development of the hardware and receiving tremendous benefits which include machines at manufacturers cost, 10% royalty on VMC sales which uses AMC technology (which will be most likely 100% by the way) and now as of today 100% of the profits from chips sales until the NRE is repaid.   VMC And AMC Are Proud To Announce The "World's Fastest Bitcoin Mining Chip".SPRINGFIELD, MO, - June 27, 2013 - Active Mining Corporation (AMC) and Virtual MiningCorporation (VMC) are announcing today the preliminary results from VMC's partnereASIC (www.easic.com) regarding the performance of the Fast-Hash-ONE Bitcoin mining chip,built on eASIC's top of the line 28nm technology.Each chip holds 20 miner cores, with an expected frequency from 800MHz (16GH/s)to 1GHz (20GH/s). This is possible thanks to eASIC's expertise and AMC's heavilyoptimized design, making Fast-Hash-ONE the "World's Fastest Bitcoin Mining Chip".The chip is expected in limited quantities in Q4 2013 and fully available in Q1 2014and will be the backbone of AMC's drive to be the "World's Largest Bitcoin MiningFarm".VMC will also use this chip in its Fast-Hash-XXX and Fast-Hash-TH series of Bitcoin MiningMachines, with Prepaid Pre-Orders immediately available on VMC's web site.Prepaid Pre-Orders for bulk purchases of the Fast-Hash-ONE chip will also beimmediately available on VMC's web site (www.virtualminingcorp.com).The maximum NRE total cost asked to us is around $1,000,000, but we are expecting it may godown from there. We estimate a total sale of 4,000,000 shares at ฿0.0025 for covering allthe NRE associated costs, considering BTC/USD fluctuations.AMC has released 2,000,000 shares yesterday at ฿0.0025 on BitFunder, as a headstart forlong-term investors, resuming the gathering of necessary funds for NRE costs. Today wereleased the remaining 2,000,000 shares at ฿0.0025 on BTC-TC following the approval there,as a means for gathering more investors. Although it can be debated, a price of ฿0.0025 for the current batch is an excellent entrypoint for anyone investing into something of this scale. "We're not in Kansas anymore!" VMC is also announcing today that 100% of the profits from bulk sales of theFast-Hash-ONE chips will be reimbursed to AMC until the total amount that AMC has paid toVMC for the NRE to create this chip is totally reimbursed to AMC.  AMC will alsohave the First Rights Of Refusal on a number of machines built with the Fast-Hash-ONE.eASIC's details:eASIC was Rated Third Fastest Growing Semiconductor Company in North America onDeloittes 2012 Technology Fast 500 and their choice as our partner is a significantone. Our excellent news is possible thanks to eASIC's ingenious process to integrateAMC's optimized code into a fully functional ASIC in record time. Please checkeASIC's web site for futher information. At the moment, only 45nm information is availablethere for the eASIC Nextreme-2 family, but it is sufficient to fully understand ourshort- and long-term plan on 28nm and lower.As a summary, we'll present two very important key features that are part of ourace in the sleeve for AMC, which will help everyone realise how this project can beexecuted in weeks/months, rather than years:Fast Turnaround ASICs"When it comes to device manufacturing and test, eASIC Nextreme-2 family takes onlya fraction of the time of standard cell ASICs as only one via layer needs to becustomized for each design. This means that wafer manufacturing can start muchearlier and even during the design stage itself."easicopy ASIC Migration"easicopy ASIC provides OEMs with a seamless path from a eASIC Nextreme or Nextreme-2NEW ASIC to a, cell-based, easicopy ASIC thereby enabling OEMs to further reducedevice cost and power consumption, or increase performance."Other Important News:The second order of 3 Avalon's have arrived and are now hashing, bringing AMC's totalhash rate up to 400,000+ MH/s.Still on order are:- 68 Klondike-16 chip boards (~306,000 MH/s) with an estimated delivery date of Mid July;- 20,000 Avalon chips (~5,640,000 MH/s) with an estimated delivery date of Mid August.We are also busy working with our Electronic Engineering and Manufacturing Servicesfirm to create our Fast-Hash-XX Avalon clones.Our prototype is getting close to being manufactured.  We also have on order completeboards to build the first 40 Avalon clones for AMC's estimated delivery of 8/31.AMC will have the next 22 machines built with a delivery date TBD.=========================================================Technical Details Of The Fast-Hash-ONE 28nm ASIC Chip:The design is built on eASIC's 28nm Nextreme family process.Bitcoin Engines: 20 fully unfolded, optimized hand routed cores.Expected operational frequency: 800MHz nominal (1GHz max).Performance design: 16GH/s at 800Mhz.Estimated Chip Power Consumption: 11.136 Watts (~0.696 Watts per GH/s).Packaging: 28nm Flip Chip design, Standard BGA 672 (excellent heat dissipation).Die size: 27 x 27 mmFab Technology: Global Foundries advanced 28nmDesign type: Optimized code, 100% Hand routed for max performance density.Availability: Estimated Limited quantities in Q3 2013, with a higher volume in Q1 2014.Reference board material will be provided as soon as possible.These are Preliminary Specifications and can be subject to change.=============================================Technical Details Of The Fast-Hash-XXX Series Of Machines:Highy modular design, with great expansability.Each Board contains 16 chips @ 16 GH/s each, for 256 GH/s per board.Each Base unit can contain from 1 to 6 Boards (256 GH/s to 1.536 TH/s).1 to 6 Expansion cases may be added to the system.

Well, just for you it will be Friday.   Not tomorrow, Thursday!   Good Move!     Sorry, but there is noway to edit the post. @lewicki You are very sharp!     VMC and AMC will be making a joint announcement this coming Thursday abouttheir Research And Development. Timer removed. End time: 2013-06-27+18:00:00 Yes, It is just like when Ukto required AMC to do a poll here in the forums. Your stake, since you are a miner is to try and keep AMC down, so that your hashing rate will make you more bitcoins.You have said this in your post before and I will paraphrase "Mining is a zero sum game you have to take it away from some other miner to make it yourself".So that is your stake in attacking AMC.  AMC is building a very large mining farm and you want to do everything you can to stop what we are doing.  It has nothingto do with you trying to protect newbies and everything to do with protecting your mining income.  Yes, you are a competitor AMC mines bitcoins you mine bitcoins, verysimple.  That is the truth, there are only 40 Million Issued shares of AMC.  Just look at the image posted in this thread. You are exactly right about Book Value, however in the Bitcoin world Book Value really does mean anything.  Where can you buy anything for $4,500 which is what the 3 Avalon's AMC has hashing now cost and get ~$4,500 a week for that asset which is what the Avalon's are making at this time.  So, I used the income stream over the next 8 months as the value of the asset, makes a lot more since in the world of Bitcoin than what you tried to prove with you high Price To Book Value example.   @Entropy-Uc  Have you ever disclosed that AMC is your competitor, because you are a miner yourself. Here is my calculation of the Price To Book value of AMC5.651 TH/s future hashing starting by August 31, 2013 at 40,000,000 Difficulty (Over 2X the current difficulty) by that time would generate $1,458,007.07 in eight months, the time left for the 40,000,000 Million shares to receive 100% of the dividends.  Now, take 50% of that revenue stream and reinvested that back in mining to keep the revenue stream up with the rise of the difficulty for the next 8 months.  Now, the revenue stream after the 50% reductions would be $729,003.535.  Now, lets convert that to BTC at the conversion rate used in the profit calculation which was $104.87 so that is 6951.497425384 BTC.  Now, lets calculate the Price To Book Value which would be (40,000,000 * .0008) / 6951.497425384  = 4.603324729 Price To Book Value, which makes AMC at this point a great value.  Of course, Bitcoinx.com "Extrapolating bitcoin difficulty or price is pure voodoo", but above we have tried to take a stab at something that just might be close.  This does give us some idea of what the value of AMC is at this point in time.Kenneth E.

News is coming soon! Thanks, I will check that out. Yes, I see than happening soon. I have had a very good trading relationship with ninjaboon.He is very easy to work with, and follows threw on everything he promised.I would give him a rating of AAA+ This sounds like a excellent idea.Yes, the Bitcoin market is moving very fast, however by building the Avalon clones we have gained valuable experience and have hired an excellent Electronic Engineering and Manufacturing Services firm to help us with the design.  We might be a little behind the ball for selling these machines, however AMC will have there own supply of machines by the end of August to start mining with.  These machines will have an ROI at retail (which AMC is not paying) of ~30-45 days.  So, AMC unlike any other mining cooperative does not have to depend on some manufacture i.e Avalon, BFL, KnC or anyone else to get its machines to mine with.  This a very big advantage for AMC and was the plan from the beginning.Now, since AMC is working on developing its own chip, news to come soon on that front, it is very possible that we could move from being behind the ball to being in front of the ball.  I have told Ukto about this bug, so he is aware of the problem. Auction Winners:iluvpcs 2@60krlekm 1@65 Gone No, just keeping everyone informed about what is going on, good and bad.Here is an update on the current luck:Average luck per 10 shifts [Since Difficulty Change]120.35%  69.82%  147.37%  100.75%  98.24%  97.55%  104.36%  131.74%  132.66%  125.40%  141.12%   Current PPLNS Luck:Average luck per 10 shifts [Since Difficulty Change]64.97%  145.70%  106.49%  93.35%  101.57%  98.68%  135.04%  130.17%  125.31%  139.82%  Past luck is not an indication of future results. Don't worry, should AMC need to release more shares to the public, it will be due to the fact that we are in need of capital 1) to develop the chip we are working on, 2) to complete the increase in the hashing rate with the chips we have on order.  3) to increase the hashing rate of the cooperative by purchasing more chips.  All of the foregoing will lead to higher share prices in the long run.  We have received news today and will be releasing it in due course.June 20, 2013 Update:  The news we have received is still unfolding and may take a few more days before it is released.  Thanks for the excellent analysis.   You see all I see.  See previous post about our increase in hashing power which we have posted.  The wild card here, is if we can get our own chip, which can be competitive with KnCMiner's chip.  If so, then the machine sales and chips sales would really boost the value.  But, don't take that into account, just use the increased hashing power, add to that the 50% growth and development fund to increase the hashing power even more.  See VBS's spreadsheet in this thread for a more detailed forecast.   Thanks for investing in AMC.  Yes, you are right about being to optimistic with what we have now.  Now lets look down the line a bit.  We have a total of 5.651 TH/s coming on in the next 2 months, plus 10% royalties from VMC for machine sales and chips sales.  So, just use the 5.651 TH/s in 2 months and estimate what the dividends will be with an increase in difficulty.  Use 40,000,000 shares as that is all that gets dividends for the next 11 months. IMHO I think it is undervalued by 15X to 25X. [BITFUNDER] [AMC] [PAID] 40,000,000 @ ฿0.00000101 @candoo What is the price for all the boards? Going Twice   Not yet, I will post here as soon as I hear something from Avalon. Going once!  
Yes, I knew you was a competitor, now you posted your offer in my auction.No, I don't have them in hand, just 2 1/2 months away and 8 times faster than yours for $2,000 less. Not BitFunder, just the AMC description which I would go by the letter on.  I have not had time to read it for this application.  We are waiting on some results forour own chip before we would make a decision on BFL chips.  SwissMiner, Are you a competitor?  I think you are. I am glad you had a chance to read the description for me.  I have been busy getting our own chip going. The units we have on the web site are just pictures of our cases, the Avalon clones only have a controller board, not a motherboard.  However, our future series willhave a motherboard and you will be able to mine LTC with the CPU on those units.  We will be providing a trade in plan for these Avalon clones to allow our customersto upgrade to our expandable series of machines.  The machines are guaranteed to do at least 80 GH/s.  So we will take you offer of 65 BTC if you are in the top50. No testing, maybe a network problem. (  Right now, We have 2 internet connections and will be adding a third.  We will also be setting up some proxies to switch between these connections. @VBS, thanks for doing the math, your expertise is most welcome. Yes, that is exactly what I was thinking, so I have changed it back to 1 BTC.  Also, what is nice is the amount in the bitcoin address will always be within ~1 BTC of the total forthe week, giving investor a transparent look into how much we are mining. Thanks, That will help. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=158806.msg2394951#msg2394951 *So 64 cards times 20 GH/s = 1,280 GH/s or 1.28 TH/s Doesn't look like any fees are being charged to us.  However, I did change it to 5 BTC to cut down on thenumber of transactactions. @LorenzoMoney Great idea.Just downloaded BFL reference board, so we will be looking at it today. I won't be posting the png anymore as they take up a lotof space in the thread.Here is the address that AMC uses to withdraw its mining revenue to.  Use thisaddress to see how much BTC we have mined.  We withdraw from BTCGuildif we get over 1 BTC in the account.http://blockchain.info/address/1DJpsvnM7xTnQbWEhLYyCyfxQyxwupEzCa Sure, the pictures are from the manufacture of the cases we are going to use.  Our prototype is in the process of being build.  The estimate on the time to get it completed is three weeks.  The Avalon clones we are building do not scale, so we will have a trade in program for our customers to protect their investment in our bitcoin mining equipment.  How we plan to scale to 1.28 TH/s is with our own PCIe board which uses that interface for communications.  What that does in our system is that it allows up to go from 1 card ~20 GH/s to 64 cards using the main system plus 4 expansion cases.  So 64 cards time 20 GH/s = 1,280 GH/s or 1.28 TH/sNow, to do the 4.8 TH/s is a box uses the same set up above, but has our next generation cards in the unit.  Each card will be 75 GH/s.  These specification are subject to change as we are still working on our 45nm and 28nm chips.The plan for the 45nm and or 28nm chip is to build the card about and an even fast card with the 28nm chip.I hope i have answered your questions, if not feel free to ask here or PM me. @ninjaboon Due to the high front-end cost to manufacture these machines, it is not possible to do escrow.  This is why BFL, Avalon, and many others have to do Prepaid Pre-Orders. Anyone who want to come to our manufacturing location at 450 H S. Union in Springfield, Missouri is welcome, just give us a call at 855-One-Bitcoin (663-2482) so we can arrange a time to meet you.  Also, just had a meeting last Thursday for the first time with a fellow miner here is Springfield.  His forum name is rustyh17, I am sure if you sent him a PM he would tell you that I am a real person.  He has offered to help us set up our manufacturing line. Yes, John is the most trust person on the board.  However, all the parts and chips will not be here until August.  We are working on a very aggressive schedule to get the machines shipped by the end of August.  That is the reason for only doing 50 machines. Yes, you are right, however do you know how much $$ it takes to build 150 machines. We will have the prototype build in about 3 weeks, this is a clone of the Avalon without any changes, so it is already tested.  We will be posting pictures of the prototype when we receive it.
Yes, I understand what everyone thinks.  Springfield Missouri.  Yes you can, still has to be pre- ordered Prepaid Pre-Orders Only [Auction] 150 Fast-Hash-80's ~90+ GH/sVirtual Mining Corporation (VMC) is auctioning 150 Fast-Hash-80's (Avalon Clones) with 50 to be shipped 8/31/2013and the remaining 100 to be shipped 9/30/2013.  VMC has retained an Electronic Engineering and Manufacturing Servicesfirm which has over 20 years experience in PCB/PCA design, prototyping, firmware, software development, manufacturing, packaging, certification, and regulatory compliance testing.  Our prototype will be ready in three weeks.  Specification Of Machines:Weight 12.3kgMining Module Type Fast-Hash 20+ GH/sExpandable 20 GH/s To 1.28 TH/s ( We will provide a trade in plan to our upgradable system )Rack Mountable 4UPower Supply ~1500 Watts GoldBitcoin Mining Modules 4Front Fan 120 mm 5500 RPMExhaust Fans 2 X 80 mmSwitch Key Lock Intrusion SwitchMonitor Lights Power Supply, CPU, & RAMTemperature Monitors 3 IncludedUpgradable No To Fast-Hash-XXX ( We will provide a trade in plan to our upgradable system )Options Mining Modules, Expansion Case, Rack Mount Slides & Key-Lock Front Bezel ( After using our trade in plan )Fast-Hash-XX Version 1Chip Type Avalon 110nmMaximum Chip Speed ~300 MHzChip Size 110nmModule Interface AvalonDimensions English 17.5 x 16.9 x 6.9Dimensions Metric 445 x 430 x 176Order Status Prepaid Pre-Order OnlyFront Panel Controls Power On/Off, System ResetIndicator Power StatusPacking Single carton with VMC logoPorts Front USB 2.0 (x2)Disclaimers *The specification and pictures are subject to change without notice.Metal Material SGCCMetal Thickness 1.2mmPlastic Material Type ABS-HBRegulator Compliance FCC Class A Verified, RoHS Compliant, CE Certified, UL CertifiedAir Filter Removable/Cleanable*The specification and pictures are subject to change without notice.All Sales Are FinalRULES OF THE AUCTIONEach bid must be posted publicly in this thread.Minimum bid is 60 BTC.

Avalon Earning Report: Yes, I have received a PM from a person with a large chip credit.  He said they are coming out with a reference board, so I will be looking in to that. Yes, it would be nice to lower the fees, every little bit helps.  BTCGuild is nice right now so that everyone can see what we are doing and they just turned on merged mining on stratum.  The best would be P2Pool with its 0 fee, however that would not be very transparent to investors.  It also takes some extra work to get that set up for the Avalon's.  A little note is that we have been very lucky these first 8 days of mining and personalty found 4 blocks.  I am sure we won't be that lucky every week or we would be solo mining very quickly.ID: 211435 A working prototype of our Fast-Hash-80 machine.  We are still working on the 28nm chip. Yes, they sent an email. It says "Completed" after it is shipped. Thanks TAT, I could use a few more, just received 30 sample chips yesterday. I am glad you love Friedcat, does he have his own thread? Here is AMC's Ranking on BTCGuild ID: 211435 Yes, It has been a long week, I am a little tired.Here is some good news, we have just retained an Electronic Engineering Services firm. We will have our first prototype of our Fast-Hash-XX series within the next three weeks. You can say that, however you didn't even put any facts behind your statement, at least canuck had some reasoning and facts behind his statement. You are right ~25% TODAY!  As soon as we need the facilities we will have no problem housing our equipment in a facility with ample power.  One question are Asicminer facilities underground?Again, your're right, TODAY!  Maybe not so right next week, or next month.Yes, you are right again they are at 110nm going to 65nm.  AMC is going to 28nmAMC has already delivered and I have hired two engineering firms, one for our chip design and one for our board design.Yes, I guess they do, producing those great 10 GH/s errupter boards.Yes, AMC gets 10% and does not have all the cost of manufacturing, all profit and by the way that is twice the normal royalty of 5% for things like this.Also, AMC gets a number of machines at Manufacturers Cost, that is a really tiny benefit.Yes, they have and they where called scammers at first.AMC likes to keep the Investors informed. First Week Earning Report Yes, I am trying and I think I have rose above the retailiatory and emotional responses.  I think you are right, I think it is undervalued by aleast 15 times.
Thanks, I am pretty good too, but a little rusty. My accounting is a little rusty, won't be that way for long, but I think in the assets in accounting the debits increase the account if I remember correctly. Yes AMC Accounting For May. Weekly, week ends Tuesday 23:59 UTC, dividends paid within 48 hours of that date. Dividends of 0.00000077/share have been paid. Yes, we will account for the exact expenses in the accounting after the end of the month. Daily Earning Report and Payment For Dividends Less a 10% Expenses Hold Back. Sometime today, running 143.58% luck, so trying to get a little more in so the dividend will be higher before we pay out the dividends. .0008 is the lower limit not the upper limit. Todays Earnings Report: We will be designing the boards for the chips.  However, the chips are still in R & D. One other income stream although related to hardware sales, is chip sales.  Avalon sold ~7.5 Million Dollars in chips is less than 2 months, should AMC have a better chip it could do the same or better.  So a 10% royalty whould bring in ~$750,000 to AMC confers and that would be about 0.01875/share or 22.218272307 X the current price of .00084390. I might be interested.  Do they have a reference board?  I will not sell any shares in a private transaction lower than the current market price.  As I have said, I want to increase shareholder value which is indicated by the spot price.  Shareholders do not have to worry, as I am in for the long run and want to increase the value of the company. No, I am not trying to avoid any of you questions,  At the moment I have a turn key web hosting business.  Most of the domains, I have registered are not for businesses I have now.  They are just digital real estate that I hold for future projects or products.  Yes, can2it was the web hosting business project, that I tried.  I didn't really find a good nitch for this business, so it really didn't take off as I had planned.  I do have customers on the turn key web hosting business, if you would like to get started in the web hosting business and be another godaddy, I can get you going in about 5 minutes.  In fact our site http://www.virtualminingcorp.com is running on top of the turn key web hosting business application. Current Earnings Report: You can find the chip order here: https://bitfunder.com/asset/AMC profile->images It is a png file.  Should work in any browser.
We have order our prototype boards and are in the process of putting prototypes together. This was just a little test to see how the market reacted to a few shares (~150,000) being sold.  We are starting to spin up Avalon boards to get ready for the 20,000 chips we have on order.  In the next few weeks there may be a need for increased capital.  I am working hard to increase the price of AMC's shares and get the most value from the shares that AMC still holds. You are right and an explanation is in order.  These shares are AMC's and are in a different account for accounting and dividend purposes.  Should AMC wish to sale these shares they are moved to AMC's main account.  I also believe that the spot price is very important and is an indication of what price the shares should be sold at to get the most value for AMC and its shareholders.  Should AMC get an investor which wants a large block of shares we could use the transfer function to move those shares after receiving the funds, these funds could be something other than bitcoins.  The price for these shares would depend on a number of factors, the main one which would be, would this transaction increase shareholder value.  This type of transaction is an advantage for AMC and its investors as there is no fee charged by bitfunder at this time for these transfers.  I always want to maximize AMC's shareholder value and I am constantly looking for ways to do that.  The spot price is the best indication of the current shareholder value and I am striving to increase that at all times.  Here is the ~Second 24 hours, not as lucky as the first 24. Just received an email today from Avalon that they are shipping our sample chips. From the description: BTCGuild 24 Hour earnings. Thanks, I will sure will.   I already have one.  I will be creating it next week when we get ready to move Bitcoins toBitfunder to pay the dividends. Here is a screenshot of our First 24 hours income.  This first 24 hours will most likely be a little lower then the next 24 hours.  With PPLNS it takes quite a while to get the 10 shifts full and start receiving income from those shifts.  From now on the shifts will be full as long as we don't have any down time.  I will try and post this everyday about 5PM CDT, however I am really not good with routine kinda of things so I may miss a day or two or if I am out of town.  I have not created one yet.  I use a special program that I wrote to make the address more secure.  I will be creating one before we pay dividends andI will post it here.  We will be posting screen shots of AMC's BTCGuild account show the amount mined and the Total Paid Out. Just a lot easier with the IPhone.Anyway, here is a picture of the workers on btcguild. Later, a picture of the first 24 hour earning on btcguild. SPRINGFIELD, MO,  June 8, 2013  VMC a manufacturer of the Fast-Hash Bitcoin Mining Machines has announced today that they have received word that AMC's technology which is undergoing a feasibility test with a Major Semiconductors Company using their tool for their 45nm and 28nm chips.  The quote from the engineer on the 45nm chip "the preliminary result shows the sha256 can run at about 300Mhz" and "With the code, while running at 28nm, we are seeing performance in the range of 450MHz+".  This code that is being tested is not AMC's highly optimized code due to a problem with the tools that that semiconductor company was using.  Active Mining Corporation is a Vanuatu International Business Company DBA Active Mining Cooperative (AMC). Must have been in July.

Thanks, I will change that, thanks for the heads up.  Heat is not a problem in the server room as it is about 64 degrees.  BTC Guild Team Rankings: Yes, I am going to do that, set up some proxies, like you suggested.  I didn't expect the machines to be here today, I thought it would bemonday.  Since it was today, I had BTCGuild setup and I wanted to get them running/hashing.Yes, this is just the begining for AMC. Current Speed. They just started hashing, so the rate is just starting to go up.  See the above post where I show the screenshot of the rate.
The Avalons have arrived and are hashing on BTCGuild.https://www.btcguild.com//index.php?page=rankings&section=teams Team AMC  ID 211435We will be setting up some proxies and have three different internet providers for redundant connections to the internet.   New update on the 3 Avalons:http://axs.net/AMC/DHL-1.png Sorry, 5,640,000 MH/s Only issued shares receive dividends, that is 40,000,000.  So the calculation is ~384,000 GH/s = 6.187484187/Day after power X 7 = 43.312389306 / 40,000,000 = 0.000001083/Share/WeekWhen the next 3 Avalons get here the dividend will double.   In about 5 weeks we will be adding another 306,000 GH/s.  In about 10 weeks we will be adding 5,640,000 GH/s.Plus, 50% of the revenue from the machines goes back into buying more hashing power. 3 of the Avalons are on the way, should be here on Monday.  After they arrive we will configure them and they will start mining.  After about a week of mining we will pay out a dividend to all issued shares of 100% of the mining revenue for the week.  So as long as you hold your shares you will receive dividends on the mining revenue of these machines.  3 more Avalon's are to be shipped to us in their batch 2.  We also have 68 16 chips boards coming ~306,000 GH/s.  Also, we have 20,000 Avalon ASIC chips on order giving us ~5.651 TH/s of hashing power.  You can use the link below to calculate the revenue from the machines.  One other thing is that half of the revenue goes back into buying more hashing power.http://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/ No, for security reasons. As soon as they get here and we can get them configured. The address is the same.  I never rebought shares at a higher price than what I was offering the shares for.  I only rebought shares at a low price to keep the speculators from purchasing the shares at an even low price.  This made the speculators mad, like yourself. I am sure you did, you are looking for anything you can find to drag us down.  AMC has a contract with me, purchasing the 6 Avalon's that I paid for out of my own pocket.AMC only has Pre-Orders with VMC.  AMC and VMC have a contract which is posted in images on bitfunder.com which spells out their relationship. I am sure it won't, but your opinion is not what counts.  What counts is the opinion Investors have of AMC.  That opinion that has been expresed is 2.5 Million shares being sold in about 24 hours, that what counts. Maybe, you should wait, before you condemn us.  Why, don't you hold off until the Avalon's get here on Monday or a week from then when we start paying dividends.  No, you have to do it now, because you won't have a leg to stand on then.  You have to get you punch in now, then run away when the above happens.  I am sure you won't be posting after we start paying dividends. Did he do that at first, No.  It took some time before his ASIC was developed, then it took some more time before it was deployed, then it took some more time for him to scale up the operation.  Now, after all of that you can say that he keeps his promises.  However, you are here trolling and running down or operation without giving us a chance to prove ourselfs.  I guess you was doing that same thing to ASICMiner before he did all of the above, now you are on his side. Minor Miner, I thought you said you was not going to post here anymore, since we figure out that you are a competitor developing your own product.  You are just trolling here.  Royalties are spelled out.The contract specifies this:AMC will receive license fees in the form of Bitcoin mining machines at cost and royalties from VMC for it's technology.The following will be ordered from VMC if funds are available and the units are developed.  AMC will have the first right of refusal on the below units developed by VMC and any futuredeveloped units. Additional units will be provided at lowest retail value minus the 10% royalty fee.** Fast-Hash-XXX is a trademark of VMC developed Bitcoin Mining Machines. AMC will receive the above machines at manufacturers cost. AMC will also receive a 10% royalty from VMC on all other VMC sales using AMC's technologies. Here is the definition of 'Manufactures Cost' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_cost3rd party entity 'SplendidCRM':  Just a typo in the contract.Can you quote some case law on '...entire document invalid due to...'.  I kinda doubt it. The contract which is signed a sealed by VMC and AMC is posted in the images on bitfunder.com.  You should try looking around and reading all of documents before you start trolling here. Usagi, You know that Avalon does not change any of the shipping addresses on the units.  The address the unit are to be ship tohas been posted online before.  Just a little of your FUD. No, As I said before AMC owns all of the IP and gets paid about twice the normal royalty when VMC uses it.  I am providing the funds for VMC's manufacturing operations.  AMC is only providing the funds agreed to in its contract with VMC, which is posted at bitfunder.com.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_cost Just got back from renting 2600 square feet for our combined mining and manufacturing facility.  I already have "Team AMC" at BTCGuild.  I will check out which pools to use.    First 3 Avalon's order # 1245 are on their way:
First 3 Avalon's order # 1245 are on their way: This is being done by AMC, for our Investors.  No action on the part of our Investors is required at this time. Things are good with Ukyo.  Had a Skype conversation last Friday. Here are the Transaction IDs for the 2 Orders of Avalon chips.51c441dd02c7743800e17c8cdc53c3af26a543da9cf2e989754950b7251ef9071ba8f144d6dcc4c07dc89b8a4a4112e2d83e619f26f9f7426c65c09c1d8a90c7Here is an image of the shopping cart showing the chips ordered from TSMC.Please note that the 4,500 BTC for the machines is really $4,500. Yes, However I am concerned about getting the units out of Russia. Changing to Seychelles now, easier that Vanuatu. Burnside, since you love doing it check this out: Seychelles. Only the First Batch, there may be up to 3 more batches if capital is needed.  The next batch will be released at no less than .0008/share.Bitfunder is where they are traded.Check Bitfunder.com asset AMCNo, but the first 6 Avalon's have a hash rate of 384,000 MH/s and use power of 3600 watts.  You can use this link to calculate the current income:http://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/Just fill in the hash rate and power from above.  Multiply the daily rate by 7, then divide the income by 40,000,000 and multiply it by the number of shares you own.  This will be an estimate of your dividends if the machines were here today. I agree that starting and doing a bitcoin business in a professional and honest way is the way to go.  That is why VMC is incorporated in Delaware, why we have a toll free number to contact us, a professional web page with all of our products listed, and why we will be providing a complete accounting of May's activity to Investors by June 15th.  However since you have admitted to being some kind of competitor to VMC and or AMC, Investors on this thread can take your attacks with a grain of salt.    Thanks for the suggestion. One point you are missing, is we did not say that we are going to use Avalon chips for all of the 992 TH/s, so your calculation are a fraud.  If fact I havetold you over and over that we are working on a 45nm and a 28nm chip.  Those chips will use 10X less power that Avalon's. Burnside, like you told me, figure it out yourself.  The stock exchange is on a RIPE address when you do a traceroute. This is our 24 month projection with a 40X times increase in the difficulty.  We have gone from 384,000 MH/s on order to 5.651 TH/s on order in just one month.Since we are putting back 50% of the revenue back into purchasing more mining power we will cause an exponential growth of hashing power over the next 24 months.Of course the 992 TERA is just a projection.  Also, should we get to 45% of the network hashing power, we would not add anymore hashing power untilour control of the network falls back to 40%. SPRINGFIELD, MO,  June 2, 2013  VMC a manufacturer of the Fast-Hash Bitcoin Mining Machines has announced today that they have purchased a second full batch (10,000) of Avalon chips (Order # 10473)  to build ~31 Fast-Hash-80's for AMC, this would bring AMC's machine total to ~71 units. The ~71 machines will bring the cooperatives hash power to ~5,650,816 MH/s, ~35,651 GH/s, or ~5.651 TH/s.  Active Mining Corporation is a Vanuatu International Business Company DBA Active Mining Cooperative (AMC).You can use the link below to calculate the income:http://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/Estimated Hash Rate: 5,650,816Estimated Power: ~60,000Avalon Shopping Cart Screenshot:https://bitfunder.com/asset/AMC profile->images Yes, I know the price was higher the week before, then dropped back to .0005 due to market demand dropping.  The shares were selling at .0005 before that date.  I hope to drive the share price up so this won't be an issue for you or me.  Let me think about this.  I will post an update to the program should I extend it, which I am thinking about doing.Update:Added a group to the program. Now that our First Batch of Early Adopter shares has sold out we are waiting for the Avalon machines to come in and start producing revenue.  We will then start paying dividends to our Investors after the first week of mining with the Avalon's.  Due to the fact that shares were selling with good demand at the .0008 price level, before Ukto of Bitfunder.Com forced us to reduce the price to a bargain level, we will only be releasing shares in batch 2 at no less than .0008 BTC.Also, we are implementing our Investors Protection Program (IPP) for those Investors who purchased shares higher than .0005 after May 28, 2013 04:59 CDT and on or before May 31, 2013 14:59 CDT.  IPP will reimburse our Long Term Investors the difference between the price they purchased their shares at, and the price of our shares on August 31, 2013 at 00:01 CDT or .0005 whichever is higher, only if the share price is below .0008 BTC on August 31, 2013 at 00:01 CDT.  The Investor must still own the shares to be reimbursed.  This program is being implemented due to Bitfunder.Com forcing us to price our shares at .0005, without due cause.  Of course we will strive in the coming months to raise the share price and add shareholder value to the shares our Investors hold.  Update:The group after May 28, 2013 04:59 CDT and before May 31, 15:59 CDT are add to the above group. SPRINGFIELD, MO,  June 2, 2013  VMC a manufacturer of the Fast-Hash Bitcoin Mining Machines has announced today that they have purchased a second full batch (10,000) of Avalon chips (Order # 10473)  to build ~31 Fast-Hash-80's for AMC, this would bring AMC's machine total to ~71 units.

AMC has now been spun off as a foreign entity on a foreign exchange.  We have also posted a PPM on bitfunder. Ukto, ask me to remove the ask while we had a conversation.  
We are in the process, since Ukto force us to price our asset at .0005 today, of working out the details of how to make it right with our investors. Yes, I think this might work.  We have checked our transactions to see how we can identify the purchasers and have some ideas on how to do that. The shares may be posted at no less than .0005 per share. Thanks, just trying to do what is right.  I did not have a choice as Ukto was going to freeze the asset if I did not comply, also if I raise the price, or if I don't have all the shares posted.  Not of which is required in the description. That might be it the works, I am thinking about how I can make it right for my investors.  Ukto, did not give me a choice, he used his "God" powers to drive theprice down to .0005 when there was demand at .0008. I have already been thinking about that, also maybe an increased special dividend after the Avalon's get here.  I will take money out of my own pocket to make it right.  I also will work extra hard to raise the share price back up. I think there was plenty of demand at the .0008 range and the volume was good.  Now by your God action you have caused myinvestor to be mad at me.  I had no choice except to reduce the price to .0005 when I all the right per the description to sellshares at no less that .0005.  You have hurt my reputation my you blantant action based on what in your "God" mind was theright price.  The market was setting the price.  I tried to sell shares at .0009, but the market did not agree, so I reduced myprice to .0008 and the market started buy again.  I have went my the letter of the description which is posted on bitfunder.com Sorry for the legal ease.  The description says that AMC may post the shares at no less that .0005 The description does not say that, and it controls. Quote from #bitfunder IRC channel:As per Ukto Bitfunder.com God, I have post all AMC IPO shares at .0005Update from #bitfunder IRC channel: My two orders on Feb 18th are 12XX and 18XX. Not yet.   Yes, Getting close on the Avalon's, someone received their info where they purchased on the 17th, we are on the 18th.  The first 3 are at order # 1245 which is a low number in the batch. If you are in Long Term, you won't be disappoint.  The speculators drove the price down.  I expect the price to rise after the Avalon's get here. Oh, yes we will be adding employees, mostly to VMC.  AMC only has provisions for wages if we have 4 or more employees.  Right now we are putting AMC resources into increasing the cooperatives hash rate as fast as we can.It won't be long before our credibility goes up. Nice, +1 That would be nice, then I could have some time to get some real work done, instead of fighting fires here on bitcointalk.  Seriously, since you brought it up, I am going to be setting up a 9 director board to govern the cooperative.  1 share = 1 vote.  The .0005 plan was not working very well.  We only sold 400,000 shares in the first 3 weeks of the IPO when you could buy as many shares as you wanted up to balance of the 5,000,000.  As soon as I took the 4.6 million shares down, the market took off. Now the price is floating with the demand.  Its called a market. I own 40% of the company, or 40 million shares.  These 40 million shares do not receive dividends until the total dividends paid is .0005 per share and 12 months have elapsed from the date of the IPO May 1, 2013.  I have invested the 6 Avalon's which are paid for.  I am continuing to invest my time and talent developing AMC's IP which will bring the investors a 10% royalty on machines VMC sells with AMC technology.  The dividends are divided between the 40,000,000 issued shares of which 20,000,000 shares are in the growth and expansion fund.  This fund is used to purchase more mining machines from VMC or others.  AMC will receive dividends from unsold shares which will be used to purchase more mining machines, R & D, direct mining expenses, etc.
Read the description, it has all the answers. FYI "Press Releases" are not from the press, but for the press. You can bet, that I will do a press release on that. The projection are based on what hasing power we have on order and the bitcoinx.com profit calculator.  Check here: https://bitfunder.com/asset/AMC profile->images for an image of our Avalon order.  Of course the projections are based on the current difficultly and the current exchange rate.  I don't know what the confusion is about the company.  We are a mining cooperative which has 6 Avalon's on order and which may be shipped to us any day.  We have purchase 1,150 Avalon chips which we are putting on BkkCoins boards.  We have ordered 10,000 more chips from Avalon and are in the process of spinning up Avalon reference boards.  We are getting ready when the funds are available to purchase another 10,000 chips from Avalon.  All of these will start mining and producing income which will be paid out as dividends to the Investors.  We are also working on creating our own 45nm and 28nm chips.  We are working hard everyday to make AMC a winner, anyone who agrees with us should hope on board.I hope this clears up your confusion.  However, I am getting so busy that I most likely will not have time to keep posting in this thread.  However, I will keep everyone informed by putting timely press releases.   Maybe not, getting one anyway. Not much. No not #1 now, G.ASICMINER-PT dividends are due today, so its volume always goes up. Yes The standard one when you bring up the bitfunder page.  AMC was number 1 for about 24 hours. Yes, I guess I should disclaim the current exchange rate.  Nice titles. I am sorry you feel that way TradeFortress.  You was giving me S*** a month ago, now AMC went to number 1 on Bitfunder.So it seems a lot of Investors don't think the way you do.   How is that any better, what if something happen and the difficulty went down, nobody really know what thedifficulty is going to do.  Seems to me to just calculate it at what we know and make a disclosure that thedifficulty may go up or may go down in the future and these are just estimates. I am sorry that it wasn't the answer you was looking for, read our description on Bitfunder it contains all of the above information. I don't own over 40% of the shares much less over 60%.If the shares rallied, I don't know what we would do.

SPRINGFIELD, MO,  May 29, 2013  VMC a manufacturer of the Fast-Hash Bitcoin Mining Machines has announced today that they will purchase a second full batch (10,000) of Avalon chips to build ~31 Fast-Hash-80's for AMC should AMC provide the capital in the next few weeks, this would bring AMC's machine total to ~71 units. The ~71 machines will bring the cooperatives hash power to ~5,650,816 MH/s, ~35,651 GH/s, or ~5.651 TH/s. At the current Difficulty (which may be more or less in the future) of 12,153,412 this will bring the estimated total revenue as of this writing to a total of $30,318.86 per day and a yearly amount of $8,681,346.78.

Active Mining Corporation is a Vanuatu International Business Company DBA Active Mining Cooperative (AMC). Yes, that would be close.  Of course [# of shares owned] * (BTC104.28 - [cost of electricity]) / 40,000,000 will go back intoto buying more mining equipment. I will take a look at this.  Looks good from your post.
Yes, I am check the shopping cart everyday and will post a press release when the status changes in the shopping cart. Nice to hear from you Deprived,You have most of it right.  However, I don't receive dividends on most of my 40% for the next 12 months.    The dividends are going to the Investors and AMC.  AMC will be using all of the dividends it receives for R & D, and purchasing of more hashing power for the cooperative per the description posted on Bitfunder.The contract between AMC and VMC that you forced me to write, which turned out to be a good thing and I want to thank you for that.  This contract which is posted on Bitfunder causes VMC to have a fiduciary responsibility to AMC.  Wikipedia: "In such a relation good conscience requires the fiduciary to act at all times for the sole benefit and interest of the one who trusts." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary I think you are very close.  I figured the amount with the hashing power we have purchased with a 50% reinvestment of the income stream back into new equipment to make up for the difficulty increase to be .01 BTC.  Of course this could be more or less depending on how the hashing rate increases over the time frame after we receive the equipment.  So I think your estimate is good and conservative. Yes, a few things to think about.  I am happy to buy all the shares anyone wants to sell at .0007999 this keeps the speculators out of the marketIt is not the NDA but confidential information we don't want our competition to have. VMC is getting ready to spin off AMC as a foreign entity which will have a 9 member board of directors.We just posted our "Private Placement Memorandum" on Bitfunder here are the links:http://axs.net/AMC/PPM/PPM0001.jpghttp://axs.net/AMC/PPM/PPM0002.jpghttp://axs.net/AMC/PPM/PPM0003.jpghttp://axs.net/AMC/PPM/PPM0004.jpghttp://axs.net/AMC/PPM/PPM0005.jpghttp://axs.net/AMC/PPM/PPM0006.jpghttp://axs.net/AMC/PPM/PPM0007.jpghttp://axs.net/AMC/PPM/PPM0008.jpg I don't own 60% of the shares, you need to read the description a little closer.  We want the stock to rally, we want investors to have a good "Long Term Investment".Selling shares depends on our capital needs to buy more equipment, R & D, and other expenses related to mining.  When the Avalon's get here they will start generating capital,so I see the need for selling shares decreasing in the future.  Board seats are sure possible in the future. Just sit back, the plan will be revealed soon and you will see the light. Yes, that would be nice, however I don't think that is going to happen soon. Not at this time. Thanks lewicki for your opinion.  This is a high risk investment which offers a very high return if we can pull off being the next ASICminer.  I am going to do my best to make sure this does not go down in flames.  One thing you can count on is I have the ability to turn a business around when things are not going in the right direction.  I was able to turn around my ISP business when the Free internet services started taking a lot of my business.  I was able to adapt to the current climate, then as the Free services dried up, I was able to have the ISP business grow for another 6 years until dial up internet dried up.  This business is a little different, I don't expect those kind of problems, but there could be others.  I will be ready for them if and when they come. You are right, you need to base your trust on what we have shown to have done, like purchasing 10,000 Avalon chips with the funds we have raised on Bitfunder just like we said we would. Nice quote! You are right about the current difficulty not being where it is today, it either is going to be higher or lower, that is why in the statement if you would notice we say at the current Difficulty.  I have to say, I think you are wrong about it being obviously misleading.  We also say the estimated total revenue.  You are right about it being over inflated valuation because investors see what value is to come.  Linking to the wikipedia.org article proves my point as all of our statement are 100% true and always will be. Please read the definition  of pump and dump here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump First of all we are not making any false and misleading positive statements.  All of our statement are true and are not misleading.  We do have 6 Avalon's on order, we have 1,150 Avalon chips we are turning into hashing cards due in about 4-6 weeks, and we just ordered 10,000 Avalon chips to turn into hashing boards.  We have not made any false or misleading statements. Yes https://bitfunder.com/asset/AMC ->News Yes, We are also selling machines.http://virtualminingcorp.com/ Yes,  We have a 1,150 chip order with steamboat's batch 1 order date May 1, high in the order of the batch.  We are sending these straight to a board developer to create 68 16 chips boards for us.  Avalon chips 9-10 weeks from that date.Our batch order number 10409 with Avalon ordered today, 9-10 weeks shipped to us to add to our 80 chips Avalon reference boards that we are spinning up now.Of course, the 6 Avalon's which should be here soon. Yes, Working on spinning up Avalon's reference boards now. It is $4,500 for 3 Avalon's.  When Avalon changed to BTC for the 3rd batch, they changed their shopping cart and all the $ turned to BTC.

Options on AMC?  Not mine.  Love options. ) Yes, as soon as I get my shopping cart to work with bitcoins, I have already done this before, but the shopping cart is a new to me, so it is taking a little time.  Also, so semiconductor stuff in front of doing that.  I hope it will be today. I would not count on .0005 again, I don't see that happening unless there is a crazy demand for capital.  I can'trule that out, but I don't see it happening.When the Avalon's get here and start mining there is going to be an inflow of capital to AMC from the 20 Milliongrowth and expansion fund shares.  20 Million are for the growth and expansion fund and will collect dividends to buy more mining equipment from VMC or others.  This shares most likely will not be sold, check our description on bitfunder.com for details.20 Million are "Early Adopter Shares" and the first 5 Million of those shares are being sold now.3,036,23 remaining of the 5 Million shares of the first batch as of the writing. Yes, lets do that! SPRINGFIELD, MO,  May 28, 2013  VMC a manufacturer of the Fast-Hash Bitcoin Mining Machines is announcing today that they have ordered (Order: #10409) a full batch (10,000) of Avalon chips to build ~29 Fast-Hash-80's for AMC should AMC provide the capital in the next few weeks, this would bring AMC machine total to 39 units. The 39 machines will bring the cooperatives hash power to 3,504,000 MH/s, 3,504 GH/s, or 3.504 TH/s. At the current Difficulty of 12,153,411.71 this will bring the estimated total revenue as of this writing to a total of $19,280.28 per day and a yearly amount of $5,398,450.75.

Slaughter, CEOVirtual Mining Corporationwww.virtualminingcorp.com+1 (855) One-Bitcoin (663-2482) X700Springfield, MissouriAs soon as the 6 Avalon's are received.  When I talked with Yifu at Bitcoin 2013, he indicated that they would be shipping batch 2 in about 2 weeks. Thanks We have already made deposits to VMC for machines and they have purchased Avalon chips in steamboats batch 1.We will be posting on bitfunder a full accounting of the funds by the 15th of June for the month of May.  I think it would:  Here is the address we are holding bitcoins at to purchase the chips:  16yTynjmSe5bsRGykDaaCL5bm2pxiEfcqPWe would like to purchase a full batch as group purchases have a commission of about 9.5% You are right, that is what happened, however that Early investor had over 3 weeks to pick up his 20K @ .0005.  Even at double theprice in the Long Run we will drive shareholder value up.  I think even that investor that picked up 10k @ .001 will be very happy. Did you mean to say early speculators/flippers, because if they where investors they would be waiting for the dividends. You must have missed that fact that I am taking 50% of the revenue to purchase more machines to keep the revenue stream consistent.  Also, this is the only way to estimate the revenue stream.  I fully disclose that this is based on today's difficulty so that makes it neither deceptive or fraudulent. "If you make your Investors successful, you will be successful"
6 Avalons, plus 33 more Fast-Hash-80's to be built = Total Revenue In A Year Of $5,398,450.75 As Of Today. Take 50% To Purchase New Machines To Keep The Revenue Up As The Difficulty Increases.Capitalize the remaining revenue at 5%,  Value =  $53,984,507.50So the value of income from the machines that will be built plus the Avalon's owned by the cooperative is = ~$54 Million or $1.349612687/share or 0.101497532 BTC / shareNow, consider the fact that AMC will use the proceeds from the IPO to develop an ASIC for Bitcoin Mining and/or to purchase more mining equipment, you can easily see where the shares in the future could be worth quite a bit more.In addition, VMC will be paying AMC a 10% royalty on any machines it sells with AMC technology and you havea cooperative where the share price could explode to the upside.   AMC To Add Massive Amounts Of Hashing PowerSPRINGFIELD, MO,  May 26, 2013  VMC a manufacturer of the Fast-Hash Bitcoin Mining Machines has announced today that they will purchase a full batch (10,000) of Avalon chips to build ~29 Fast-Hash-80's for AMC should AMC provide the capital in the next few weeks, this would bring AMC machine total to 39 units.

AMC is a hybrid mining and development cooperative and a business unit of VMC. I am working on doing this exact thing.  However, it is more proprietary information than NDA. Sorry, under NDA. No, the orders just show Processing.  I will do a Press Release as soon as the order status changes.I am hoping to see a status change this next week. Yes you are right, I spend a lot of time on the market, that was because my team and I was driving back from Bitcoin 2013.  During the drive we were able tobrain storm some great ideas which will make AMC investors a lot of money. You are right, you were trying to frame me and you did, so congratulations on your plan.  You are just a speculator that got caught and now your're mad.  Any LONG TERM investor inAMC will be way ahead on their investment in the LONG RUN.  AMC, in its actions, were trying to raise funds to purchase more machines from VMC to make the "LONG TERM INVESTORS" more return on their investment.  Also you may notice that this is a self-moderated thread, but I did not delete your comments.  The reason for not deleting your post is that I believe in Freedom Of Speech; however, you must be 100% truthful in your comments. Yes, that is correct. 6 Avalons, plus 3 more to be built = Total Revenue In A Year Of $274,272.46 As Of Today. Take 50% To Purchase New Machines To Keep The Revenue Up As The Difficulty Increases.Capitalize the remaining revenue at 5%,  Value =  $2,742,724.60So the value of just what the cooperative owns = ~$2.7 Million or $0.068568115/share or 0.000519455 BTC / shareNow, consider the fact that AMC will use the proceeds from the IPO to develop an ASIC for Bitcoin Mining and/or to purchase more mining equipment, you can easily see where the shares in the future could be worth quite a bit more.In addition, VMC will be paying AMC a 10% royalty on any machines it sells with AMC technology and you havea cooperative where the share price could explode to the upside.   No, the capitalization is the number of issues shares times the share price.  This would be 40,000,000 * .0005 = $2,640,000http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization Yes, I have 6 Avalon's on order, but you was talking about the 100 Avalon order which is not in this offering. Me too. What wafers?   What fab?   Where did you get your mask taped and when?Sorry, to sound skeptical but what you are saying does not make sense.   [/quote]No problem, only time will tell as they say. I am sorry that you can not think outside of the box.  The wafers ARE almost done. I think you are reading the wrong description of the offering.  VMC is building its first series of machines on Avalon's technology.  VMC's second and third series of machines will be based on AMC's technology which is 45nm and 28nm chips.  Yes, my team will be receiving the wafers and then packaging them.  We also have a Low-Volume production method which is a lot faster for 45nm and 28nm chips.  Yes, 45nm machines delivery date of 12/31/2013 and 28nm machines of 6/30/2014.Yes, a lot of thing can happen, that is why we will have Avalon's mining soon.  That is why VMC is using Avalon's chips to build their first generation of machines.All of this was designed to protect the investors investment in AMC. The design was started last year, it is proven to work.  I will need the funds soon for the NRE.  We know what we are doing.  The wafers are already almost done. The research and development/purchase fund are the shares being sold now.  The funds from the IPO will be used tobuy machines if the ASIC can not be developed.  If AMC can not develop an ASIC, then VMC will try and use other vendors of chips to build its machines. The development/purchase fund is the first 20 million shares of which the first batch is 5 million shares which are being sold now.If the current feasibility test shows that it is not feasible on this chip, there are other options which maybe feasible.  None of AMC's fundsare being spent on the feasibility test.
That is not part of this offering, due the unpredictably of Avalon. You are right, wasn't trying to screw anyone over, was just trying to sell some shares.  I will work on building the price back up so that investors will not get screwed. AMC may issue up to 20,000,000 "Early-Adopters" shares which may be posted for no less than 0.0005 BTCeach and will also issue 20,000,000 growth and expansion fund shares to AMC.  The "Early-Adopter" sharesmay be posted in batches with the first batch being 5,000,000 shares.  Only the first 40,000,000 issued shares will receive 100% of the monthly profits after all expenses until the total dividends paid is equal to .0005 BTC per share.  AMC will only issue 40,000,000 shares (20,000,00 "Early-Adopter and 20,000,000 AMC growth and expansion fund shares) until the total dividends paid is equal to 0.0005 BTCper share and 12 months have elaped from the date of the initial offering.  Should it be determined thatit is not feasible to develop an ASIC chip, then the remaining funds in the research and development/purchasefund will be added the growth and expansion fund.Additional shares may be sold at no less than .001 BTC each.======================================================================may be posted We are in the process of porting our Bitcoin mining software to 45nm and 28nm chips using the semiconductors tools.  This is being done to see if it is feasible to continue the development process on this chip.  Should it turn out to be feasible, then we would go to production on the chip.The RTL is written in Verilog and is highly optimized for Bitcoin mining.  The code has been synthesised in Xilinx and the semiconductor company is currently porting the code usingits tool to see if it feasible to run the code on their chip.  I hope this helps. We are in the process of taking pictures of our prototypes.  These are just pictures of the cases we are using in our Bitcoin miners  I could not say it better myself. Sorry, to get everyone upset.  Here is my intention.I am going to do everything to the best of my ability to make investors investment in AMC pay off for them.As our contract with VMC states I will do what is in the best interest of AMC and its investors.I just want to thanks all of the investors who have invested in AMC.  I am working hard to make this work foryou. We have issued 20 million for early-adopters and 20 million for the growth and expansion fund.These will be the only shares receiving dividends for the 12 month from the date of the IPO. Yes, the first 20,000,000 million shares are early-adopter shares.  Yes, all shares trading on bitfunder.com at this point are early-adopter shares. Yes, I think things are looking up.  If only the Avalon's would get here. AMC is a hybrid mining and development cooperative and a business unit of VMC.We have been working on this project for a little over a year.Not yet,  but we are working on it. Springfield, Mo  May 22, 2013  AMC has announced today that they have started the process of porting their Bitcoin mining code to a FLip Chip 672 45nm.

PCIe motherboards with required number of slots are more available.We are looking into the cyclone's above. No, that was the news from Avalon in April.  Talked to Yufi at Bitcoin 2013 and he said they would start shipping this week.  What I expect is to have the machines mining by the end of the month.  However, this depends on Avalon. Fast-Hash-80's 20% Discount extended until 5/30/2013 due to the problems with our shopping cart which will be fixed in the next couple of days.Should you want to order now, PM me. This program has expired. It takes 9-10 weeks to get the chips, depending on our sales, we will order a full batch or do a group purchase. Thanks for the info, I will fix that. Not at the present time, maybe later.
Our Fast-Hash-XX are Avalon clones. www.virtualminingcorp.com No, I don't think so. Our Fast-Hash-80 are on sale at 20% Off thru May 21, 2013www.virtualminingcorp.com Yes, that is the supplier of our case, as we have said before we are using a lot of off-the-shelf parts in our product.  This helps cut the cost and insures that we have a good supply.You are right, you can only put two double slot GPUs in this case.  However, we are not selling our product with GPUs we are selling our product with ASICs. It is very simple, it takes a lot of time and cash to produce an asic device. We are estimating on shipping our 45nm series of machine by 12/31/2013 and our 28nm by 6/30/2014 Yes, I will make you a good deal for your help.  Of course, they are 20% off thru the 21st. Looking forward to meeting you. Yes, come on down and I will take you to lunch at one of my Favorites places, Jimm's Steak House, it used to be a Steak & Ale, Jimm used to be the manager. One other this is that we will be working to modify the case to provide the power requirement required forthe 16 mining cards it the system and the required power cables. We have bigger plans for the CPU. Not yet, but I will looking into it.  If someone orders the extender case and we change we willreduce the price and refund the difference between the retail prices of each box.  I have a few others, if you don't mind: -why use 50 BTC MAGMA PCI extender boxes? Cheaper (way cheaper) solutions exist.We will be looking for the best extender and the best price.  Specifications are subject tochange.-why use dual CPU motherboards (when a Raspberry Pi would suffice)?We are doing a lot more that you know about at this point. (Bigger plans for the system and the bitcoin network)-why with mixed PCI/PCI-E connectors?I like what else is on the board.-why use PCI-E and not USB?Datacenter compatable-where will you source the Spartan 6?Don't know yet.-why only 20 "prototypes"? Avalon chips are cheap and "readily" available.This is what we think we can produce by the end of August.-why such a low count on the second batch? Even Avalon started with 300.Again, just what we feel we can scale our manufacturing up to.-given the previous will not fund your R&D, how do you finance the project?You don't that it will not fund our R&D.-do you plan a reseller program?Good idea.-do you plan an affiliates program?Another good idea?-do you plan on mining yourselves?We have a mining cooperative on bitfunder.com you can check it out here: https://bitfunder.com/asset/AMC-why?We like mining too.-why no company information on the website? (business reg., address, etc)Had to get ready for Bitcoin 2013, we will be adding to to the Web Site all that information.We are a Delaware corporation.I hope i answered you questions, if not PM me or make another post. Tlhanks for asking this question.  The only improvements to our Fast-Hash-XX series will to make it scalable to 4 expansion cases and upgradable to our Fast-Hash-XXX series and Fast-Hash-TH series.   Most of our work is going to be put into our 45nm and 28nm series of machines. Magic What is suspicious about our pricing? Anyone at Bitcoin 2013 today, I would be happy to meet with you.  Give me a call at (855) - One-Bitcoin (663-2482) X700. We are not developing 26, 45, 65 and 90nm chips, only 45nm and 28nm.  These chips do not go into ATX boards, they will go into a custom board that uses a PCIe interface that plug into an ATX board. Yes, We just had a meeting with our Semiconductor company last Friday.  We know what allthe cost are.
Yes, and we will have a prototype as soon as we get chips from Avalon.  We are in an order placed on May 1 for 1,1,50 chips which arefor machines in our AMC mining cooperative. We have just estimated the speed to be about 50% gain over our 45nm chips.  However, in our meeting with our Semiconductor company which is currently doing a feasibility study on our RTL code, they indicated that the 28nm chips may have 100% gain over the 45nm.  Of course these are just estimates as we say about, but we have tried to be very conservative with the estimates. The Magma case is an option, if you check out our shopping cart you can configure the type of machine you want.  Since I am here at Bitcoin 2013, I had to only put the button for the one product, our Fast-Hash-80, but I will be fixing the cart for the other options. Yes, we just started the company, however check out my axs.net which was registered in 1997! Our first series of machines will be build using the tested technology of Avalon, there chips and there board, this will be our version 1 board.  We will then take that board a re-spin it with a PCI express interface so our customers will be able to use our expansion case.  After we re-spin the board we will have an upgrade program for our version 1 board for customer who wish to upgrade.  We have chips on order from Avalon and will be placing more orders for chips depending on our sales.  Our delivery date will be adjusted based on sales.  The current date for delivery is only for the first batch of machines that we order chips for in the next week.  This also it depends on our suppliers, i.e. Avalon.  I talked with Yifu at Bitcoin 2013 and Avalon is not going to be build any more machines, they are just going to be a chip supplier.Our second and third series of machines will be build on our own Fast-Hash chips 45nm and 28nm.  Since we are here in San Jose at Bitcoin 2013, of which we will be posting video on the site, we had a meeting with our supplier of our chips.Since we are using Avalon's technology chips and boards we don't expect a long testing time.  Also, talking with Yifu, if we could order a complete order of 10,000 chips, we would receive some testing chips.The rest of our parts for our machines our off-the-shelf and are readily available.  Our shipping date is firm for about the first 20 devices sold, then we will move that date back to 9/30/2013 for the next 100 macines.I hope this gives you the information you need. Good luck! Yes, these will be our Fast-Hash 28nm chips. Yes, these are stock pictures of the case we will be using in our production.  We are using std atx boards in our models and off-the-shelve parts,so that we will be able to supply are larger number of units.   That is our expansion case.   Virtual Mining Corporation is now taking pre-orders for itsFast-Hash-80 80 GH/s Bitcoin Mining Machine.www.virtualminingcorp.com VMC Signs NDA with Major Semiconductor CompanySan Jose, Ca  May 17, 2013  VMC has concluded a meeting with a Major Semiconductor Company.

SPRINGFIELD, MO,  May 14, 2013  AMC has announced today that it has entered into an agreement with its parent company VMC. VMC will be providing credit to AMC so that AMC will be able to purchase its first batch of 100 Pre-Ordered machines. AMC will only have to provide VMC with a 10% deposit before the machines are shipped, AMC will pay VMC a 10% APR rate on its outstanding balance. VMC will use its Best Effort to provide the machines to AMC. AMC still has its first rights on machines it has the ability to fund. AMC will also provide machines to its Investors which have qualified under its Premier Investors Program. AMC estimates this will increase it hash rate to over 8,384,000 MH/s and its daily revenue to over $43,927.23 or $3,752,264.73 per year at the current difficulty. AMC is a hybrid mining and development cooperative and a business unit of VMC. New Chips Coming For AMC Machines Will Revolutionize The Bitcoin Mining MarketSPRINGFIELD, MO,  May 9, 2013  Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC) on behalf of AMC has announced today that they are in serious negotiations with a Major Semiconductor Company to produce 45nm and/or 28nm Bitcoin mining chips using AMC developed technology. Should these negotiations be successful, these chips will revolutionize the Bitcoin mining market. More to come at a latter time. AMC is a hybrid mining and development cooperative and a business unit of VMC. Yes, Thanks for finding that.  Should be 160,000 MH/s

PIP will allow an Investor that purchases at least 100,000 AMC shares to purchase one machine from AMC's first batch of Fast-Hash-80's at manufacturers cost which is estimated to be 50 BTC. Investors would be able to purchase machines out of AMC's first batch of 100 Fast-Hash-80's which AMC does not elect to purchase. Should AMC elect to purchase all 100 machines, then AMC will give Investors the option to purchase a machine at 90% of the retail price from VMC and be placed at the top of the Pre-Order queue on a first come first serve basis ahead of any public Pre-Orders. Investors may purchase one machine for each 100,000 shares of AMC which are purchased before May 15, 2013 and maintained in their Bitfunder account until their purchase is complete. AMC is a hybrid mining and development cooperative and a business unit of VMC. Zero Well each will get 50% of the revenue, that is the way it is setup for the first 12 months from the date of the IPO.  20 Million shares are reserved for the growth and expansion fund, so for the next 12 months that would be 50% of the revenue less expenses (max 10%), then that will drop to 20% of the revenue less expenses (max 10%) after the first 12 months.  The other 50% of revenue will be paid out as dividends to the investors each week for the next 12 months like above.  See our offering for full details: https://bitfunder.com/asset/AMC Yes, thanks It is a little more complicated than that, so you should check out the description above or at https://bitfunder.com/asset/AMC.The short answer is for the 12 months following the IPO 50% of revenue less expenses (max 10%) will be reinvested in more hashing power.  The time schedule isASAP.  Also the IPO funds are being used to purchase more hashing power along with R & D.The plan is for AMC to build a large Bitcoin Mining Farm, starting with the 6 Avalons which are on order, having VMC build machines for AMC.Using Avalon chips and technology in the short term.Developing AMC's own technology using 45nm chips.Taking the 45nm chip technology and moving it to 28nm in a 12-13 month time frame.Using all this technology to build AMC's Bitcoin Mining Farm bigger and better than anyone else. Have you talked to Ukto on IRC?  You can use the web interface on bitfunder.com under the help menu.  Ukto is the operator on weexchange and should be able to help you. Good Questions!We have never said that we can produce a 45nm chip by the end of this month.  What we have said is that we are working with a Major Semiconductor company that can produce the 45nm chips in a 5-10 week time frame after we deliver RTL to them.1.  Yes, all 6 Avalons which are on order have been confirmed and paid for.  See our images of the order confirmations here: https://bitfunder.com/asset/AMC     The only news from Avalon was on May 1.  See this thread for more information. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=167726.msg1746355#msg1746355     The first 6 machines will be in my current location, which has enough power and air conditioning for the 6 Avalons.  Security at this location is excellent.  At the current time we     are looking for a location for the other machines.  I have an excellent location in mind, which has it own power and air conditioning.                2. We already have Bitcoin Mining RTL synthesis, and should we convince the Major Semiconductor Company to work with us, then we will port the software.  It the short term    we are using Avalon 110nm chips.3.  It doesn't need to be completely subscribed, but would be better if it was.  We are putting 50% of the revenue from the 6 Avalons machines back into AMC to purchase more Bitcoin      Mining Machines.  Also the dividends from the unsubscribed shares will go back into AMC. VMC is funded through private capital and sales.  VMC will be doing Pre-Order in the future and will have its own IPO.Right now we are putting all of the technology together to provide machines to AMC.  Currently the difficulty is increasing about 1 million every adjustment period.  However, AMC will continue addinghashing power to keep up and get ahead of the difficulty. The 360 million is predicted at the end of the 24 month period for the projections in our IPO.

Not Virtual Mining, but the Semiconductor company. Yes, but they didn't even know what Bitcoin were. They could google Bitcoins if they knew about Bitcoins which they didn't.  Because you know about Bitcoin doesn't mean everyone does.  They did not know about them until I started talking to them about Bitcoins.  Management is starting to talk about them.  So this poll is trying to show them that this market is big, if you can deliver the goods fast. Go ahead and punch your screen:   Yes, I know that, but a Major Semiconductor Company does not. Maybe the 100nm is a typo, we are using Avalon chips for our Fast-Hash-XX series 20 GH/s - 80 GH/s.Not trying to sell you anything here, just trying to get a little information. Did not say the it was Rack Mounted, it is Rack Mountable, only if you want it that way. Just reduced it to $15,000. Just got the web site put together, not trying to sell anything at the point.  Just tryingto get some information.  See updated poll above.  Typo, Wrong date should be May 2014, I get that changed.

No. See https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=158806.msg1979322#msg1979322 for answers to the concerns above. Specific Question Above:1.  Yes, See contract above.2.  30 Days Written notice, See contract above.3.  Yes, it could,  VMC has to take AMC's best interest into account.  See contract above.4.  VMC will be selling machines to the public after AMC first 100.  VMC should be making a profit, which could be used to refund     to AMC, see contract above.General Questions:1.  Yes, See the contract above.3.  VMC will be selling machines to the public after AMC first 100 of each batch, so VMC will use Pre-Orders from the public and an     IPO for their operating capital.  VMC was originally considered, thought up, and began investigating possibilities after Avalon first gave us     3 days notice on their batch 3, the fact that they may not have a batch 4, and BFL delivery date is maybe the end of June.  Also BFL track record     is not very good.  Avalon is also falling behind a month now on their delivery date.  So VMC was thought up to solve these problems and give     AMC an advantage in getting the machines, a win for the investors in AMC. Sorry for the delay in answering you post.  Our estimated delivery on our Fast-Hash-XX series (20-80 GHs) is August 2013.  We are purchasing Avalon chips which they say that can be supplies from TSMC is 9-10 weeks.  We are ready have the machines designed, we just need to spin up the Printed Circuit Boards (PCB)s get the Avalon chips and have them installed on the board.  After we receive the boards we would install them in our already design rack-mountable cases.  The rest of the system is off the shelf components which are readily available.  At the same time we will start our 45nm development project.

AMC was originally considered, thought up, and began investigating possibilities as early as December of last year.I decided to leverage my connections, background and experience to create a mining cooperative. A plan was formedto purchase ASIC mining equipment out of my own pocket, and use them to raise funding to invest into more miningequipment, and to the initial investments of fabricating our own ASIC chips. Right before the IPO launch of the AMC asset on BitFunder, I was made aware of the many updates, changes, and delays to Avalon that were never communicateddirectly to me as a purchaser. Admittedly, I scrambled to adjust things more than once to compensate for recent changesin both Bitcoin and Avalon.I have just issued a full reimbursement to all current AMC shareholders at the original price of 0.01 BTC and removedall current shares. The asset will remain frozen on private status for now.Over the next while, I will be working to update, correct, and remake an agreement so that it is clear, and sensible to all.I hope that all of the current investors understand and can appreciate that I have done this with their best interests in mind.I look forward to great things with the community and bitcoin. This is a very exciting time for everyone, including myself.Thank You,Kenneth E. SlaughterActive Mining Cooperative As I said on the forum before, the reason for hurrying was that Avalon's 4X price increase which caused me to reworkthe numbers, that price increase was not expected.  Also that gave a 3 days notice on batch 3, was expecting thatbatch to be around April 5.  By hurrying to push out the IPO, I made a stupid mistake, so now I have learned reworkingthe IPO from the comments I received here.  Also, I will be posting the reworking plan on  [BitFunder] AMC - The Official Active Mining Cooperative Discussion Threadas soon as it is ready.
I am reworking the plan and will be posting it in AMC's official discussion thread, to get comments from the community. Sorry, if I mislead you, I did not mean to, I put ordered in the contract which is what I did.  As you may have noticed, the 6 Avalon's above show that they have been purchased and confirmed not just ordered. I sent an order in, however I did not receive a confirmation and I because of my stupid mistake did notget the uptake on AMC's offering so as to be able to pay for them.So I am reworking AMC offer and when ready I will post it in AMC's Official Discussion Thread for the communityto make comments on before it goes live on Bitfunder.I just want to thank everyone in the community for point out all of the problems in the original offering.  I have incorporated,I think most of the communities concerns in the new offering.     Looks like C code, kinda funny. I did not confuse C with C#, I know the difference.  I was just showing him some ofmy code. Reworking the offering.Check out info on the offering here:https://bitfunder.com/asset/AMCI will unlock this thread when we get the offering reworked. I ordered them, but they are not confirmed.  Even if I had them you still wouldnot believe it.

SPRINGFIELD, MO,  March 23, 2013  AMC a hybrid mining and development cooperative has announced today that they are in talks with a Major Semiconductor Company which can provide ASIC's with lower up-front development cost, time, and reduced risk which are greatly reduced over other ASIC's. AMC said "With their simplified design flow, the time from RTL to device tape-out is typically only five to ten weeks for prototypes. This enables AMC's designers to bring new Bitcoin mining products on line quickly; then rapidly develop derivative products to cater to the Bitcoin's changing market requirements.  No too much, however burnside was questioning a corporation that I had.I have just opened up the [BitFunder] AMC - The Official Active Mining Cooperative Discussion so you may want to post thereany questions there.  I won't be answer questions here just fighting fires here. That is not the Legal definition, you need to look it up in a Legal dictionary, business n. any activity or enterprise entered into for profit. It does not mean it is a company, a corporation, partnership, or have any such formal organization, but it can range from a street peddler to General Motors. It is sometimes significant to determine if an accident, visit, travel, meal or other activity was part of "business" or for pleasure or no particular purpose.http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/business The offering on Bitfunder.com AMC has been reworked to provide the community with more information about the source of revenue that will be provided by this Hybrid mining and development cooperative.  The ASICMiner part of the plan is designed to provide income to cooperative when funds raised by the offering is idle.Since I do not believe in censorship, I will not be deleting any comments (positive or negative) in this thread, however I will be replying to them to explain any concerns. [AMC] Hardware discussion and F.A.Q.Update: AMC is merging with VMC, so all AMC shareholders will have the possibility to convert their shares into VMC shares, at a 1:1 ratio. This FAQ will also be updated in the future to reflect these changes.So, where can I see the current AMC hashrate and mining profits?Currently AMC mines on BTC Guild at around 430GH/s, as User 211435 and as Team AMC. Accumulated mining profits are stored in BTC address 1DJpsvnM7xTnQbWEhLYyCyfxQyxwupEzCa. Here's a graph of that.So, what do shares represent? Ownership?Shares do not represent ownership, they are "solely a distribution mechanism for rights to profits", and used as a means to liquidation.Wait a minute... I'm not "owning" a part of AMC, just a piece of the "profits" Welcome to the bitcoin stock exchange game. Learn the risks and stay, or don't. Please read https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=245713.msg2616979#msg2616979So, shares represent a part of profits then. How are they distributed?- Until at least May 2014, on the initial 40M, a minimum of 20M are retained for growth and expansion and a maximum of 20M can be sold to investors.- In May 2014, or when 0.0005 is payed by share, whichever happens later, an extra 60M are created, for the final total of 100M. On these remaining 60M, a minimum of 20M are retained for growth and expansion and a maximum of 40M can be sold to investors, with 40M being retained by AMC/Ken.So, I heard I am earning a lot from AMC right now, by bagging the dividends from all the unsold shares out of the 40M?Wrong. The contract specifies that all dividends from "issued" shares still on AMC's hands are retained by the growth and expansion fund (the contract was originally written using correct terminology, but BF considers all shares "issued").The first time I get a part of AMC will be after a year of work (May 2014), when the rest of the 60M are issued. At that time, more 20M can be sold to investors, and I retain the remaining 40M.So, how can AMC be valued since shares do not directly represent ownership, but profits?You can use a simple conversion for it: [#investor's_shares * current_price], with [1 - #investor's_shares/40M] (%) of dividends being kept for reinvestment.Using current values (2nd July 2013), there are ~6M shares sold to investors and ~34M in the growth/expansion fund. At a price of 0.001, AMC is valued at 6M*0.001 = BTC6000, with 1-6/40 = 85% of dividends being kept for reinvestment.I've read a lot of announcements, but have yet to see real documents. Can you please provide some?Engineering Firm quote for Avalon machines: http://axs.net/AMC/SB-Prototype-Quote.jpgeASIC NDA: http://axs.net/AMC/eAsic-NDA0001.jpg and http://axs.net/AMC/eAsic-NDA0002.jpgSo, how will the division between AMC and VMC be implemented, in respect to chip/machine sales?Roughy, AMC takes care of the chips, VMC takes care of the machines:- AMC develops the chip, pays the chip's NRE and sells the chip in bulk to customers (using VMC as intermediary).- VMC uses AMC's chip (or any other chips) and builds bitcoin miners, paying a royalty cost to AMC whenever its IP is used.Chip sales: AMC holds IP rights on the Fast-Hash-ONE chips, so AMC contracts with VMC the following services: (a) the representation services to negotiate chip production with eASIC and (b) the re-selling of AMC's chips in bulk. AMC also guarantees chip exclusivity to VMC, so that AMC won't negotiate a chip supply contract to any other bitcoin systems manufacturer. AMC gets 70% back from the profits on the sale of bulk chips, while VMC gets 30%. All of VMC's expenses, including representation, chip stock management and re-shipping expenses to final customers are taken from their 30% profit.System sales: AMC also allows VMC to buy chips directly from eASIC at the lowest cost, for the manufacturing of bitcoin mining systems. On every sale of these systems or parts of it that contain AMC chips or IP, AMC receives a 10% royalty fee from the total gross sales revenue. Example: if a customer purchases a system for BTC100, AMC receives BTC10, whatever the profit margins for VMC are.
No, just looked up the legal definition of a business, which is to do some activity to make a profit.  Ordering something online to be able to use, is not conductingbusiness. Yes, and thank you for all of your help.  You really know what you are talking about. I don't feel like trying to run down his business, cause I don't really care.   You are so smart, tell me how I was conducting business in the state of Missouri.  Also by the way you have not disclosed where your BTC Trading Corp is registered, because in myopinion it is most likely not registrated.   ThickAsThieves, and you want to be on the team or be the consultant.  Why is it a harebrained scheme? Well, I was dealing with a big semiconductor company that was getting their chips made by Intel, so I justdidn't want to look like the little guy.  So I incorporated the company to look bigger to them, and I was ableto get their software to check out the speed of their chip.  I would have needed the company if the Achronixchips had worked out.  I don't know why I put in on the Avalon order.  So what is the big deal about thisanyway?  Do you know why the state would administratively dissolve a company? They do that when you do not send in your annual report which is due 45 days after you incorporate.  I did notneed the corporation at that time so there was no need to send in the report. Thanks, WOT? Web Of Trust? Ken Yes, when I am 100% sure I can deliver a 45nm, 6GH/s mining unit. TradeFortress, Not really, I know everyone does not want one person to have over 50% of the hashing power.  I think the same way.  Yes, I would like to build a big mining and development company, but by the time I have that much hashing power the network will be 200TH-400TH who knows with all these ASIC machines coming out.Ken Wisard, Yes, I would agree with you, so I just reworked the offer.  It is not posted yet, should be sometime today.Ken Deprive, You are right again, so do not read it and no Ukto did not freeze it. No, I froze it, no Ukto did not freeze it.  Also all the money from the sales of shares is still in the account and will stay there until I get this fixed today or tommorow.Ken Working on it. ) No, not over 50% there is an or in there, delivering a 45nm chip/ASIC mining device. Your good burnside.  Still would like to know where your corp is registered or if it is registered. Franktank, if thing go right we can have prototype chips is 5-10 weeks after we finish the RTL, our chips will be on the 45nm process at bout 6-9 GH/s each.  Our plan is a hybrid plan which give Investors dividends as soon as be start getting income from our 6 ordered Avalon's.  Our chips will be much faster and lower power.  We will moving to the 28nm process soon also for even more hashing power and lower power.  Getting ready to fix that 70% return, I screwed up trying to hurry when Avalon announced it 4X price increase and 3 day notice to batch 3. Well, I won't say no yet.  Will you escrow it?
The early-adopter shares will be sold for no less that .01, we are going to need capital for development of the 45nm chip, so we will be selling a lot more at .01 if we can make a deal with the Major Semiconductor Company we are talking with.Yes, if we need to sell them to raise capital for development. What do you mean?   Who is Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC) a Delaware Corporation and Active Mining Cooperative (AMC)and what do we do?Active Mining Corporation (AMC) is a Belize International Business Company DBA Active Mining Cooperativeand is made up of a team of dedicated Bitcoin mining professionals withover 30 years of combined experience in the ISP Business including Internet Access and Web Hosting, Graphics Design, Cloud Development, Computer Programming in Multiple Languages, FPGA Hardware And Software Design, Complete Systems Design, Web Design, and System Administration.  The team has been involved with Bitcoins since 2009.  AMC has purchased and will operate ApplicationSpecific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) Bitcoin mining machines and is developing an ASIC chip and PCBthat it will license to VMC for use in their Fast-Hash series of Bitcoin Mining Machines.  AMC isdeveloping ASIC chips on the 45nm and soon the 28nm process.  AMC's ASIC 45nm chips will have fast speeds of 6 to 9 GH/s with low power usage.  The 28nm chips are estimated to have speeds of 9 to 15GH/s per chip which will be in VMC's Fast-Hash-XXT series of machines which will have even more speedand even lower power usage. VMC may purchase ASIC chips from different vendors if available.AMC is using the most innovative technology available to develop their chips on the 45nm process and soonthe 28nm process.  Investors in AMC will receive the benefits of having dividends paid out as soon as AMC starts mining with it's purchased Avalon's and/or purchasing of G.AsicMiner-PT shares.Investors in AMC will see big benefits when AMC develops it's own ASIC chip and VMC creates its Fast-Hash series of Bitcoin mining machines.  AMC will receive license fees in the form of Bitcoin mining machines at cost and royalties from VMC for it's technology.VMC is in talks with a Major Semiconductor Company which can deliver prototype/Low Volume chips to VMC ina 5-10 week time frame after the RTL code for the ASIC chip is ported to their chip and the timing on thechip has been closed.VMC will provide the Bitcoin Mining Equipment below ("Mining Equipment") to AMC at VMC's manufacturingcost for the use of AMC's developed technology for the equipment below as a licensed fee forVMC to use all of AMC's developed technology.  VMC will also pay AMC a 10% royalty on all other salesusing AMC's developed technology.Web Site:    www.virtualminingcorp.comFacebook:   https://www.facebook.com/pages/Fast-Hash/319110168218206Twitter:    @VirtualMiningCoPhone:      1+(855) ONE-BITCOIN (663-2482)  *** Business Experience:Slaughter Vending and Amusement, Pegasus Business Systems, Advanced Learning Systems, Advanced SoftwareSolutions, Active Internet Communications - ISP Business axs(tm).net which produced over 2.5 Million in revenue and over 10,000 customers in 49 states, Canada, and Puerto Rico with over 10 employees.

Bitcoin Mining source code to create RTL for the xc6xlt150 FPGA.  This code is inthe process of being ported to a Major Semiconductor Company's ASIC chip.  The Semiconductor Company will then close timing on the design for the ASIC chip.  After timing closure, Prototype and Low Volume production of the ASIC chips will begin.After production begins, the ASIC chips can be delivered to VMC in a 5-10 week time frame.  VMC will-atthe same time-start the high production process for 28nm chip with an estimated maximum time of 12 months.  VMC will use the 45nm Low Volume production process for VMC products until the 28nm high production process is ready.  VMC has also received licenses on Printed Circuit Board (PCB) designs forxc6xlt150 FPGA Boards.  The ASIC chip will be developed as a drop in replacement for the FPGA chips onthese boards.  AMC may purchase Bitcoin Mining Chips or PCB from other vendors if available.   *** Bitcoin Network:With AMC adding hashing power over the next 24 months, AMC does not expect to have over50% of the hashing power at any one time on the Bitcoin network.  If AMC excedes 45% ofthe hashing power on the Bitcoin Network, AMC will not add anymore hashing power untilAMC is below 40% of the hashing power on the Bitcoin Network.  Also other Bitcoin manufacturing companies and miners like Avalon, BFL, ASICminer, and our own VMC will be selling Bitcoin Mining Machines to the public or will be using their own ASIC's tomine for

Working with a Major Semiconductor company right now.  I can get prototype is 5-10 weeks on the 45nm process and soon the 28nm process, and starting mining with them.  That is why I have a hybrid mining and development plan, you start getting dividends as soon a my 6 Avalon's arrive, well the next week.  Yes, but the chips will be faster and use less power.  Let me know if I did not answer all you question or you have any more.Ken I have already check OR, not there.  So you want to hide it.   Well, Yes if I buy or develop that many machines I would have that much power.  Our 45nm chips are expected to 6GH/s each. Did not need the company any more, check the [Bitfunder] tread for why if you are interested.Wrong we are selling ~8,000 shares at .01.What is the return if you buy it for .01 BTC, yes 100X that which you can do now, when unfroze.Investors get all of the .01 BTC back before I get anything.   Didn't need it any more.  Thinking about re registering it. Wisard, You are right how could they make a mistake like that, being in a hurry when Avalon announced their 4X price increase and 3 days notice for batch 3 that is how.  All my personal information name, address and gee cell phone number on my Avalon receipts.  Any more questions?  Give me a call. Yes, I made a mistake due to the fact of Avalon's 4X price increase and 3 days notice on batch 3. ThickAsThieves, Yes it was designed to be a hybrid mining and development coop, this was to give the investors more protection.  Ukto suggested that we purchase ASICMiner shares, which I think is a good idea with cash(Bitcoins) which is not being used. i.e waiting on mining machines to be purchased, R&D not being used but needed the future, commitment of cash not being used but needed in the future. Just did, ask me any question you want.  I would be happy to answer any question youmay have. burnside, not twice, I was just providing proof of my orders which I like to have a company name on.  Yes, the Virtual Mining, Inc. lapsed, because I was working with Achronix on their 22nm FPGA which turned out to be to slow and cost to much, so I did not need the corporation any more.  How ever I am going to register it again.  If you really want me to I can pay the $10 for a fictitious name if that would make you happy. Ukto, thanks for standing up a little for me, I will take over from here. burnside, can't seem to find your BTC Trading Corp registration, where do you have it registered? Wisard, I think you are right that would have help me.  I did leave my name, address and gee cell phone number for everyone to view. Deprived you are right again.  Let me explain what happened, I had the IPO and numbers ready to go then Avalon post their 4X price increase and the fact that they were going to start batch 3 on Friday.  I know you can mine only 3,600 coins and day.  The problem was I was hurrying to get this put together and I stuck the number in the profit calculator and put them in the IPO.  NOTICE:  ALL AMC-PT SHARES WILL BE TENDERED FOR ActiveMining Shares ASAPAMC is a hybrid Bitcoin mining and development cooperative describing itself as "the next big mining cooperative" is releasing today an offering to early-adopters of Five million (5,000,000) BitFunder virtual shares and issuing another twenty million (20,000,000) BitFunder virtual shares which will be used for the growth and expansion fund, which will receive a total of 100% of the company's virtual-currency profits after all expenses until the total dividends paid is equal to the offering price of .0005 BTC per share and 12 months have elapsed since the initial offering. The Cooperative is hoping to raise up to 2,500 Bitcoins. The offering price will be 0.0005 Bitcoins for the first 20,000,000 early-adopter shares thereafter the price will be .001 BTC per share. If demand is strong enough then share prices may increase throughout the IPO.Active Mining Corporation (AMC) is a Belize International Business Company DBA Active Mining Cooperative and is made up of a team of dedicated Bitcoin mining professionals with over 30 years of combined experience in the ISP Business including Internet Access and Web Hosting, Graphics Design, Cloud Development, Computer Programming in Multiple Languages, FPGA Hardware And Software Design, Complete Systems Design, Web Design, and System Administration.The team has been involved with Bitcoins since 2009. AMC has purchased and will operate Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) Bitcoin mining machines and is developing an ASIC chip and PCB that it will license to VMC for use in their Fast-Hash series of Bitcoin Mining Machines. AMC is developing ASIC chips on the 45nm and soon the 28nm process. AMC's ASIC 45nm chips will have fast speeds of 6 to 9 GH/s with low power usage. The 28nm chips are estimated to have speeds of 9 to 15 GH/s per chip which will be in VMC's Fast-Hash-XXT series of machines which will have even more speed and even lower power usage. VMC may purchase ASIC chips from different vendors if available.AMC is using the most innovative technology available to develop their chips on the 45nm process and soon the 28nm process. Investors in AMC will receive the benefits of having dividends paid out as soon as AMC starts mining with it's purchased Avalon's and/or purchasing of G.AsicMiner-PT shares. Investors in AMC will see big benefits when AMC develops it's own ASIC chip and VMC creates its Fast-Hash series of Bitcoin mining machines. AMC will receive license fees in the form of Bitcoin mining machines at cost and royalties from VMC for it's technology.VMC is in talks with a Major Semiconductor Company which can deliver prototype/Low Volume chips to VMC in a 5-10 week time frame after the RTL code for the ASIC chip is ported to their chip and the timing on the chip has been closed."In the future," AMC CEO/CTO, Kenneth(Ken) E. Slaughter writes, "the community will benefit from our hybrid mining and development cooperative by buying Bitcoin mining machines which produce income for the cooperative while the cooperative develops a Bitcoin mining chips for the cooperative's own use." AMC's shares and options are already publicly available on BitFunder.com. BitFunder is a popular Bitcoin asset platform which includes listings for several well-known Bitcoin companies, bonds, and other assets. BitFunder accounts can be funded through a developing exchange platform, WeExchange.co.The IPO serves two purposes, The first being to spread awareness of Bitcoin, "Profit-sharing helps to bring the community together and make a stronger foundation to help support Bitcoin worldwide". A number of Bitcoin businesses have "gone public" on Bitcoin-specific stock exchanges already, most notable is the popular Bitcoin gambling site, SatoshiDice.com. SatoshiDice's virtual IPO on MPEx has given hundreds of Bitcoin users a chance to take part in the business's recent growth and success. With BitFunder, smaller businesses like AMC are aiming not just to raise capital but to benefit from the public interest and community involvement that virtual IPOs generate themselves.The second reason for the virtual IPO is because AMC needs capital to execute the next phase of it's plan. AMC intends to utilize the capital to massively increase the number and income of Bitcoin mining machines that it operates. This means expanding far beyond the six Avalon mining machine on order and which started shipping April 5, 2013; by purchasing 400 Fast-Hash-80 Bitcoin mining machines, 100 Fast-Hash-400, 100 Fast-Hash-800, 100 Fast-Hash-1.2T, 100 Fast-Hash-2.4T, and 100 Fast-Hash-4.8T if available over the next two years. The cooperative will in next 2 years increase it's total mining speed to over 992,384,000 MH/s if the offer is fully accepted by the community and our development and VMC's purchase of chips as planned. "In the future," AMC CEO/CTO, Kenneth(Ken) E. Slaughter writes, "profits should increase due to not having to spend capital on research and development of our chips, also chip production cost should be dramatically reduced in 2014 and hash speed should dramatically increase." "This is what the IPO is for," Mr Slaughter writes, "to expand the total speed of our mining equipment and to provide funds to develop and purchase Bitcoin mining chips and our own mining machines for the use of the cooperative." For those interested in buying shares, AMC has Six Avalon batch 2 machines on order. The machines have started to ship April 15, 2013. As soon as these machines are received they will be set up to start mining on a pool and using the team name "Team AMC" so investors can keep track of AMC's mining speed. AMC's mining operation, with a fully accepted offer from the community will offer a very conservative estimated Net of 0.014058909 BTC per share over 24 months for early-adopters and an estimated Return on Investment of 2,812%/ over 24 months using an estimated .61 reduction in profitability and an increase of difficulty of 40 Times.Although returns of this magnitude may seem extreme - in the world of Bitcoin mining startups even higher growth rates can be quite common. AMC's hybrid Bitcoin mining and development cooperative gives the investor, a two pronged path to increase the investors return. The two prongs are that of predictable income from purchased mining machines and the extreme growth rates that are possible from developing / purchasing a Bitcoin mining chips and then using that chip to mine Bitcoins. Thanks to innovative capital raising platforms like BitFunder, the average Bitcoin user can participate and potentially yield these high returns. As Bitcoin exchanges become easier to use and improve upon their services, virtually everyone will be able to take part. The IPO is only a few days old but there are still shares available. There has never been a better opportunity to invest and get your share of the Bitcoin mining profit being generated everyday.Copyright AMC 2013 - All rights reserved Deprived you are right I should of listed my business experence of 42 years and the fact that I created a nationwide Internet Service Provider (Active Internet Communications) on the domain axs.net.
