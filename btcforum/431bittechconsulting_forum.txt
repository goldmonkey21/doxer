rETNkLzkhTa1C51GBEko7wMcr3jkkb3ENr looks like biddingpond has gone down. Is there an ETA on it coming back? Is this something you were already developing, and bitcoins just fit in perfectly, or did you see bitcoins, and decide that this would be the best use for them?  I'm guessing he is going to make an MMO, allow others to run servers, and sell items via bitcoin. Of course, this doesn't explain why he would need a stock of bitcoins... this implies he is going to be buying something. The difficulty of generating coins has increased dramatically in the last month; keep waiting. thufir (vekja.net) very helpful, good to do business with. IT serviceswww.bittechconsulting.com
