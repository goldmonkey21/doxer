We get asked quite regularly for t-shirts, especially after we started to produce our own Tor shirts and bring them to events. You can order them online from us at https://www.torservers.net/wiki/tshirt/ . This is not your regular cheap shirt, this is awesome quality organic fair trade cotton  Thanks for the ongoing support by the Bitcoin community, we appreciate all donations. Hi! We're still here, still going strong. My original German non-profit org that manages the payout to the Torservers partner organizations alone pushes 5 Gbit/s+ of exit traffic. We're 12 organizations in 10 countries.If you like Tor, and want to strengthen the network, consider donating. We currently take Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Dash (Darkcoin). Thanks!https://www.torservers.net/donate.html#cryptocurrencies https://blog.torservers.net/20131213/torservers-awarded-250000-by-digital-defenders.html Torservers was one of the first to accept Bitcoin, now finally Tor follows (via Bitpay): https://blog.torproject.org/blog/announcement-tor-project-now-accepting-bitcoin-donationsPlease understand that Tor is not as well-funded as many people think. It is crucial for a lot of activities online. Most of you will know it:So, you can now donate to Tor to strengthen development, and to us (Torservers) to strengthen the Tor network itself. Whoohoo! A lot has happened at Torservers. Since we never wanted to grow to be too large, decentralization is crucial for Tor, we put a lot of effort into bootstrapping new organizations all around the globe. Our website now lists nine organizations, with a few more in the making. This is all very exciting, and I am happy to have the Bitcoin community backing our goals.Also, just because, I created a Ripple wallet just now, so if you have some XRPs, you can send it to rPEmCPhNcQuTVuTmByWMDj2vZgzt4EY9pt.There's even more happy news to report, but I can't give that away right now. Watch out for a press release soon! I hope to see some of you at Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg. I wish I could come to Bitcoin Expo this weekend, some really nice people there, but unfortunately I can't make it.Bitcoin address: 17dHghQZw1hv7uAY5RLnGySQ8fUyazkpwuLitecoin address: LNpcV2UByLEJDmD8rZqD3qHNvoQnTf6ujx Go Bitcoin go!  Hi! Thanks for the endorsement. I'm also travelling to a lot of conferences around privacy (mostly within Europe), I'm happy to meet up.One more comment: Yes, make sure you reach the right website! You should use HTTPS at all times: https://www.torservers.net/donate.htmlThe current certificate's SHA1 fingerprint is E8:8A:0F:3D:B6:80:A6:62:29:5F:6C:94:C2:33:E9:01:39:87:DD:DE. We will soon replace it with a wildcard certificate, also from StartSSL.We're on twitter, and we have a low-volume mailing list. Allegedly, Skype built in lawful intercept *before* it was sold to Microsoft.http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jun/20/skype-nsa-access-user-data In light of the recent leaks regarding NSA and GCHQ (UK secret service), I think it's well worth pushing this thread. https://www.torservers.net/donate.html Sorry if this has been posted before, the search function of the forum fails me. I haven't even had the time to look at it more closely, but I figured it might be interesting to see it discussed in this forum. The French discussions about it are said to be of interest, maybe Google Translate is good enough for them."John Boik, founder of Principled Societies, http://www.principledsocietiesproject.org/ , is running computer simulations on his Token Based System currently. His book is available for free download at his website."http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_UDC"OpenUDC aims to define a set of open protocols and standards to exchange new currencies, and to provide a free software implementation of them.UDC means Universal Digital Currencies or Universal Dividend Currencies. Both definitions are fair since a currency in line with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights HAVE TO apply the Universal Dividend.The OpenUDC project has a theoretical reference to the Théorie Relative de la Monnaie (TRM) which can be read to understand why OpenUDC uses Universal Dividend Money System.The Universal Monetary Dividend as defined in the TRM is more precise than the Basic income as it specifies where the money comes from, how it is created, and why so. But the TRM is not a technical description of how such a money system can be developed concretely, and so the choices of OpenUDC technical tools are totally independent of the TRM.OpenUDC implementations allow human members to exchange in a spirit of equity, digital goods and services in space, between members, and time, between members and future members."  A lot has happened since my last update here. We have helped grow similar organizations in different countries, which is good for diversity and the anonymity of all Tor users. Future donations to our new Bitcoin address will be distributed fairly across all partner organizations (personally vetted by myself), instead of just spent for servers run by our own non-profit. All previous donations, or donations to old Bitcoin addresses, will still be used only for our own non-profit, as that is what we promised you.So, in the end, your donations will now be spent even better than previously. Nothing else will change for you  You can either donate to the new "umbrella organization torservers.net", and we will take care of the distribution, or you can target your donation specifically to one of our partners (or our "home" non-profit Zwiebelfreunde e.V.).Thanks for your support and trust! Thanks slush  Fixed. Hi!Nice work. Can you add us to your site?Torservers.net 1N5sJeuxCCtG8mXxhgHD3H7W5FWTHK3H21Image: https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8ed733edec441e43f3edc4f0304c4111?s=120&d=https%3A%2F%2Fflattr.com%2F_img%2Faut11-user-placeholder-large.png&r=pgTor is a free software that helps people from totalitarian states with censored Internet to access the Internet anonymously and uncensored. It is estimated to have over 500,000 daily users. Tor needs people to share their bandwidth and run relays and so-called "exit nodes". Torservers.net will use the money donated to run high bandwidth Tor exit nodes. Hi,Sorry for the late answer. I do not check this forum regularly. Yes, we've been in contact with William well before he got raided, and also afterwards.We are still going strong also thanks to all your Bitcoin donations. Keep 'em coming!

I can only repeat what I've said before: THANK YOU! Without your donations, we would not be where we are today. I am still making sure that everything goes into fast Tor exits for all of the world to benefit.Cheers!! Sorry to say this, but, no matter what, it is simply not excusable to keep a large amount like that on off-the-shelf virtual servers. abuse.ch: How Big is Big? Some Botnet Statisticsabout.com: BotnetsEven if all coins were mined by botnets, it does not directly lead to collapse. You have to read the paper though to understand why the authors claim this.  As a first comment: I don't believe in that scenario too much. Bitcoin & Gresham's Law - the economic inevitability of CollapsePhilipp Güring & Ian GriggOctober-December 2011Abstract.  The Bitcoin economy exhibits remarkable and predictable stability on the supply side based on the power costs of mining.  However, that stability is challenged if cost-curve assumption is not solely expressed by the fair cost of power.  As there is at least one major player, the botnets, that can operate at a power-cost-curve of zero, the result is a breach of Gresham's Law:  stolen electricity will drive out honest mining.  This has unfortunate effects for the stability of the Bitcoin economy, and the result is inevitable collapse.http://iang.org/papers/BitcoinBreachesGreshamsLaw.pdf 
With the same argument, people speculate on food and let other people die. Just because something is a rare property, it does not mean it is morally acceptable to block it and not even require it or use it. On the contrary.I could not care less about this specific list of domains.Your comparisons are completely off. Bitcoins and oil are interchangeable. Domain name squatting is comparable to getting up early to block the best lounge chairs on the beach, then go home and sleep and decide not to use them at all. "insurance salesmen" per se do nothing wrong. squatting domains is [more or less] ILLEGAL, and at least there's no doubt that it is morally unacceptable. f*ck you domain grabbers. burn in hell. As you might have read in the news, Iran is blocking all encrypted (SSL/HTTPS) traffic. We've been able to set up obfuscated proxies for Tor bridges on two of our Gbit servers. Tor usually sees hundreds of thousands of Iran users (2nd largest user group!), but I am proud that today over 150 Iranians found their way through our servers. Thank you! Without your donations, this would not be possible! Great idea.Code:sjdntqu5roj4q6lo.onion Sorry, I don't want to spam you, but I want to reach out to all BTC donators, especially the one who left a message in our PrivacyBox, promising a lot of Bitcoins weekly. So far, this seems to be true, and we have turned over 700 coins into money and then into Tor exit servers thanks to you! I want to make sure you all know we appreciate your confidence into us!We're going strong, pumping around 1500 MBit/s of Tor exit traffic for all those in need of anonymity on the net.In case you missed it, we're an official charitable German non-profit now! We still accept Bitcoin donations (and we're sitting on a large number of them). In case you lost hope, we will gladly accept the coins. All our Tor exit nodes allow port 8333. You can find the servers at http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/index.php?SR=Bandwidth&SO=Desc (look for addresses ending in .torservers.net).We have a total of 1200.13 BTC at the moment. Thanks!!Bitcoin address at https://www.torservers.net/donate.html#anonymous We are now the fastest operator of Tor exit nodes worldwide, thanks to your donations!  It's been a while since the last update. Sorry, but I like being busy onactually doing stuff instead of writing reports. ;-) It would be nice tohave someone go through our mailing list archive and Twitter feed, pickall important events and put them into a timeline on our Wiki (and postit once a month to our mailinglist and this forum?).This is a request for comments/action (and mostly copied from ourTwitter feed).

KalyHost looks fine for a small exit, but I am a bit suspicious when it comes to cheap VPS with "unlimited" traffic on a "fair use" basis. I have contacted them to find out more.What we are trying to do is buy bandwidth in bulk for very cheap prices. Please follow the discussion the mailing list: http://www.freelists.org/archive/torservers/02-2011 . I really want to spend all donations for the best deal I can get, because in the end that is what I promise to do. If you want to chat about this and hear about the obstacles when it comes to finding good partners for high bandwidth exits, join us on IRC oftc.net #torservers  Sure  But how do you want to ensure a 'constant stream' of Bitcoin donations? In case anyone is interested, the German magazine Carta has published an interview with me. There is NO "pay version of Tor". You can use JAP and pay for higher bandwidth, yes, but it has a different design and thus different anonymity properties.I especially like that Tor is free for everyone. If you want a faster net, donate towards us or share your own bandwidth. You can also donate to Torproject for development. The roadmap includes discussion of "incentives": https://blog.torproject.org/blog/two-incentive-designs-tor You can see the number of our servers at http://www.torservers.net/services.html#servers@bitanarchy: See https://blog.torproject.org/blog/two-incentive-designs-tor for some discussion on that. You really don't want to turn the Tor network into a capitalist system, especially when those affected by censorship are usually the people without money. We at torservers think that it is a great way for everyone who has money to support those that don't. We do not use Tor ourselves, because we live in western societies that already protects most of the properties we want to provide for everyone (protection of free speech etc). Hi!We are still alive and kicking! If you're interested in our progress, check out my twitter account at http://www.twitter.com/torservers or the mailing list archive at http://www.freelists.org/archive/torservers/ .The financial authorities should accept us as a charitable non-profit organization soon, we have been donated one 100 mbit/s and two 40mbit/s servers by ISPs, we have found someone who donates the incredible amount of 100 monthly, and we're heavily working on finding a really good partner for Tor exit node hosting - which isn't as easy as it seems, we want to get good bandwidth (500 Mbit/s to a Gbit), and that cheap, and most ISPs reject Tor on their network We are still happy to accept Bitcoin donations of course! At the moment I have ~1000 BTC, and in September as you know I sold 2000 BTC for 100 Euro. If only I had kept it! A Bitcoin address to donate is listed at http://www.torservers.net/donate.html#anonymous .If you want to know anything else, I'm happy to chat about it. My Jabber details are on the site. Good idea. Will do it with the next update. @noagendamarket Thanks! @caveden: At the moment I don't want to provide filesharing trackers, sorry. I traded 4000 BTC for 206 Euro at bitcoinexchange as soon as I got them in early September. Yes, I am very proud of the Bitcoin community to support this project with that amount!Just a quick update: Sorry, I haven't yet found the time to work on listing the donations properly. Bear with me! I am working on this alone at the moment, and have been busy talking to people about getting the association registered, and my number one priority was to get the Tor nodes working (which turned out to be harder than I thought). There's a lot going on behind the scenes in regard to monitoring etc, I want to put it all on the site once it's done. If you want to help out with anything, let me know (my jabber nick, email etc is on the contact page).I am also proud to be able to announce that we have tweaked our major server to finally reach an average of 320 MBit/s of Tor traffic as you can see from its stat at http://us1.torservers.net/ . That's exactly what the current plan is covering, and with the most famous and stable exit node "blutmagie" ceasing operation in 2011, it looks like we 'hit the market' just at the right moment.If you want to meet and missed the event in Dresden, I will be at the Netzpolitische Kongress in Berlin from 12-13th November.
