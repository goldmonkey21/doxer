Hi all,I'm involved in organising FSCONS, a Swedish conference that takes place in November, and thought it would be interesting to have someone present Bitcoin there. Are there anyone (preferrably in Sweden or close by as we can't afford to pay high travel costs) that might be interested in speaking at the conference? Speakers from other countries are of course welcome too, but might have to cover their own travel expenses./StianPS: In case I forget to check the forum, please contact me at stian@fsfeurope.org if anyone is interested.
