The only option for LTC on ethereum is with ptokens, on the home page it says pLTC proposed. But in fact its already live on the mainnet.With that being said I'm not aware of any defi lending platforms which actually accepts pLTC. I guess its still a bit early. You should put the prize amount in escrow so anyone who actually gives you what your asking for can rest assure that they will be compensated for the task your requesting.  47 - idevThank you and good luck to one and all. 91 - idevThanks Counterparty was probably the closest thing to having smart contracts implemented with bitcoin, if i remember correctly their EVM was compatible with ethereum so one could deploy the same solidity contracts with a bit of tweaking on Counterparty. I'm not sure how far along they got on with it tbh. Does this have support for the lightning network? I've recently got my account back but I'm not 100% confidant if the address above has not been compromised or not due to being on a computer which was infected. So I'm staking a new address on a new computer from a new bitcoin wallet installation.Code:----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE----This is bitcointalk.org member: idev Todays Date: 09/07/2020----BEGIN SIGNATURE----Address: 1GoLazRNHNLMi4rNHTPmCPN4qPTSnZ5Z31Signature: Hz58ziLOt00tIpKMLrKbuRlqrSheOXaE+9fsrOnxyTtBb1tS4IP1Fr+s0PAHLEqLJF1l1Sigu/ZNN0+TIoELQzU=----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE---- Selling 10 Innosilicon miners.

All machines are tested before shipping out! Lets clear this one up. First of all - to call this analysis, is a VERY bold move on the writers part. There is no solid numbers present. Most of the opinions are very subjective, most of the "analysis" is just random guesses. There is literally nothing that can be explained with anything else than just the writers imagination. Lets dig in!I will evaluate on our Magnet only, because i have a very clear understanding what is going on in the background and readers can see how this correlates with the MarquiseMuseums analyzed views... but that said i will try to bring some numbers into this mix where ever i see possible. First stopForce has a market cap of around 10 million right now according to coinmarketcap. 1000x growth would mean the total market cap of 10 000 000 000 within approximately 6-12 months time. For comparison top 6 coin right now -   Litecoin   $10,455,486,307 marketcap, so the writer suggests that FORCE will come from a obscure MN coin to a top 10-25 networks IF they are using the following strategy "dedicated design & marketing team/new website." Even if 1000x was a typo - 6 months with 100x growth is very unlikely to happen.Are You starting to see the false facts presented within the "analyzed" info?Next oneWriter has decency to warn everybody and that is actually very nice gesture. Thank You for that!In here i would like to raise a question what is the Pyramids or the Pyramid Scheme? Here is the wiki explanation - A pyramid scheme (commonly known as pyramid scams) is a business model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of products or services. As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.No masternode coin is recruiting anyone. Most crypto is very liberal and the users are 100% the ones who decide what network to support. There is no sign up reward, there is no one recruiting ever. Also if the writer would have some understanding of monetary systems or at least programming basics then Masternodes never seize to give out rewards. More people involved, higher the rewards actually go. Masternodes rewards can get smaller/less frequent, but this also means that the value of the coin is raised through invested MN costs and rewards in the end are bigger. There can be some fluctuation due undstable daily coin release through block rewards and network size also can play role in the price, but most of the Masternode coins will gain value with more users. Otherwise early investors would sell their Masternodes very quickly, but this rarely happens. During the BTC price plummet last few days (it happened because of the BTC Futures expiring - https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/as-the-first-bitcoin-futures-expire-price-and-volume-concerns-arise.html), Masternode coins were the ones to hold their price strongest. Price is usually stable due lot of coins locked in Masternodes. So now You can maybe see how the claim of being Pyramid Scheme is 100% false if You care to dig up the explanation for it? Next stopWhat does that even mean? "IF Magnet and Gobyte's ROI is transient before switching to PoS or some other planned roadmap"... We are hybrid network that utilizes POS/POW both and we have never said to switch to POS. There is no certainty of either POS or POW being the best solution, so until there is no solid way - we are going to support both solutions so our users are safe, whatever the threat. Annual ROI is in most of the cases calculated considering the blockchain real-time data. If some network decides to market themselves based on a good ROI then this is not a scheme. It is a marketing choice. Most of the times this means that network has not much else to offer than just good numbers though. So in those cases actually user should be careful, but it has nothing to do with Pyramid Schemes.Last stop before conclusion. Try to hold on a little bit more. Lets start with the fact that we have never listed the ROI anywhere on our pages or channels. We had a discussion about listing it on our webpage, but we quickly understood that this has nothing to do with our goals and we did not do it. So probably writer is referring to some ROI on some MN ranking page. Most of the pages have a warning listed that those numbers are a prediction. A bit educated crypto user should know that You cannot take the Masternode rewards/ROI as a solid basis for Your reward calculations. There is 2 reasons for that:1 - Masternode rewards on our case are randomly given out based on Masternode ranking numbers. So to have a solid numbers, we should consider the time period of a week to a month for calculating averages.. but the Masternode number is ever-changing so it is fairly hard to be precise. 2 - Masternode rewards (50% of POW block rewards in our case) are changing with the Masternode number all the time so the ROI is a prediciton. Usually it is achieved like this:- first the daily block rewards are calculated and through that we can find the Masternode rewards total daily- next You take those total rewards and divide the number with the active Masternode number- previous step gives us the daily Mn reward for 1 MN and that can now be multiplied with 365 for approx annual ROI for example So last thing is the claim "Anything above 100% ROI that is not of a temporary nature should be suspect of Pyramid scheme." This is again such claim that it hurts the eyes a bit to read it. I explained before how the ROI is calculated so it being over 100% or under has NOTHING to do with any Pyramid or any other scheme. ROI is purely based on blockchain data, it can be very different and it is deeply rooted in the demand on the market.Conclusion Main point here is that everybody runs on the same open source code and everybody using it has exact same odds to get the rewards.If someone comes out with a bit of longer text which has big words in it.. ALWAYS question and research Yourself. If You do not know how - ask people who know. Be ready to learn to make it easier for Yourself. That is the only true way to be safe. Always. KEEP ON LEARNING AND QUESTIONING THE WORLD AROUND YOU!As a last farewell i will put out few facts that can be easily checked and i ask You as a reader to consider if those are the characteristics of a Pyramid Scheme.. - during the scams happening in our slack channel, we did compensate to the users around 22 000 Magnets.

Was there an official announcement from Bittrex about RaiBlocks being added   Your account is worth an Estimated Price: 0.07908750   not sure if any lender will fill the amount you desire. They did that in the wake of the Liberty Reserve saga when the US passed new laws on regulating foreign financial institutions. So basically they stopped providing services to US resident/citizen in order to opt-ed out the US regulations. A number of fixed rate exchangers also followed suit as result of what happened. The only restriction i know of is that they don't allow you to open an account if your a US resident/citizen. Does anyone know whats the total supply of RaiBlocks, IE bitcoin is 21M but what is RaiBlocks ? Vote Here:  https://c-cex.com/?id=vote&coin=mrai To exchange Perfect Money to Bitcoin you don't need to use any exchange as you can do this yourself from within the Perfect Money website.

Sent you a pm about a small project. It takes a couple of minutes to sync up. Ah i see that it explains it, as i was wondering how do i access this information. Where do you get this info from ? Which clients apart from the core support testnet  Bitcoin does not need faster confirmation times, the way bitcoin is designed will allow anyone to build on of the blockchain which can enable instant transactions. I'm pretty sure a few payment processors provide this already. There used to be a couple of companies that used to provide physical notes a while back like bitnotes. Not sure if them or other alternatives are still available nowadays.  I can act as escrow and hold the account if you both agree. Liberland   that pipe dream got closed down before it even started. 
cointocard.co provides what your looking for although i have not personally used this service so i would highly advise you to do your own due diligence before using them. I would purchase as many coins as i possibly could afford and then wait and see what the price does. If the price moved up i would sell a small portion to make some gains and then continue trading with the newly realized gains. You can try http://coinig.com which is a web based service. If you click on the exchangers link on the epay website there is a list of exchangers who can help you.  For me it's about being the boss of my own money instead of letting some third-party hold it to ransom at their will i mean look after it for me.   Just visit the currency exchange forum to start your trading enterprise.   For me it's all about btc-e.  I don't think it really matters what gender Satoshi is and i also hope that the real Satoshi is never found. This is pretty decent and no doubt useful for newbies coiners. I'm guessing the OP must know what escrow is by now. Although the OP could of them saved themself some time and effort by simply searching this forum or google for the answer. It's not worth it trying to invest bitcoins in any sites which claims to offer X percentage. You much safer and better off just to hold on to your coins and try and exploit profits out of the price movements. You can pretty much buy anything with bitcoin already, not directly mind you but with the help of services which you pay bitcoin to purchase items for you that you can't actually purchase directly with bitcoin. I would give half to a charitable organization and keep the other half for myself. I'm not a fortune teller but one has to wonder what the price will do when the same miners will be hashing it out for less coinage. It does set the stage for a show that is not to be missed. Bitcoin does not need a bank, one of the many reason why it was created in the first place was because of banks. Jezz how many times do people have to keep explaining these again and again i just don't know. Re-check the ten commandments, that will give you the answer or better still head down to your local church and ask the priest in person.He's bound to know.  There still is no "Ellet" it's still all talk as it has been for some time now. There are plenty of ways you can earn bitcoin for free or otherwise. But if your not directly purchasing it with fiat and are trying some other long winded way of obtaining coins then be prepared to wait if your lucky, and that's if you get anything at all. Yep, a fool and his money are sadly parted on a daily basis I'm afraid. An unfortunate circumstance but like most things online it's not immune to hacking with hackers trying to exploit these sites daily. But as stated by ShapeShift, their platform is designed to protect customer funds in events like these so it would seem that only their company funds may have been taken. 
Only one place for crap like this, bung it straight in the trash and forget about it.  I think it will only be a matter of time before we start to see money transfer stores using Bitcoin. As some businesses already have stores where one can just walk in and buy some coins. Have not used it yet but it looks awesome. Can't wait to give it a try out soon. People need to stop with threads like these, it's obvious to anyone Bitcoin is clearly alive and kicking.  Will you be providing your BCT account as collateral ? Probably someone off Fiverr.  Can i see a demo of the script. I'm not on the list nor did i recivce the bonus, i sent my request to jasonk on the 15th but there is no record of this transaction in the transaction activity  although there is a record for the first $5 sent to me by firstcoins. Seems to be working now. Firefox on OSX.  I tried to request but i get. Sent ya a pm  Any working demos available ? Quite a fun little raffle, played a few rounds, lost some and won some. Just needs more users on the site to make it more enjoyable instead of waiting for some players to enter.Suggestion: To help promote your site you could implement a referral program where by members get a percentage of their referrals deposit. So even if you lose a round you still get a little referral commission. Just an idea.

This funding request has now be authorized by the committee.  Any demo available ? What price are you looking for ? Was just sent one from the user GausenNemechttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=377646 TLD still available! TLD still availaBTCle! I recently hired matu to create a custom app for me and from the very start matu has been very responsive in his communication and has handled himself professionally. He provides numerous daily updates on the projects progress backed up with live demos and or screen-shots. His work rate seems quite rapid as with my project he was blowing through the list of jobs with ease. He is also flexible in terms of pricing and unspecified changes to the project, as in the case of my project he was more than happy to add some additional features at a fair price without so much as grumble.I was so happy with the level of service and support that i felt totally comfortable to send payment in full and without escrow. matu promptly delivered the app within a few minutes after TX confirmations. (I always recommend the use of escrow when dealing with any unknown third-parties if your not entirely comfortable with sending part or full payment first!)I will definitely be using matu services again in the very near future. TLD still available!

I'm trying to get my QT on OSX to run on the testnet. I've added "testnet=1" to my conf.But after some time now i still have no connections and of course no blocks are downloading. All it says is that there is no block source available ? Yea we need the regulators as they are doing such a great job at not being brought and paid for and facilitating scams themselves.   Has my node been banned  Code:Finalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize NodeFinalize Node I see files have been added to the cryptonite website. Are these the files for the mainnet ? Whois guard don't matter much when names are publicly known. Sent you a pm. Come join us testing on the testnet Code:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=643758.0 Yea, although if you run the deamon in something like screen then you can detach from the session and run further commands in the same window.
What price would you be willing to take just for the script only ? Just runCode:./cryptonited -testnet helpTo get a list of the commands you can use to view wallet addresses, send coins, list transaction history, mining coin etc. Exactly this guy is not the first and I'm sure he won't be the last person either.

Here's a quick work around to install jdk 1.7 on OSX 10.6.8Edit the file: Code:/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plistand change your version number to 10.7.0 or higherCode:<key>ProductBuildVersion</key>        <string>10X529</string>        <key>ProductCopyright</key>        <string>1983-2011 Apple Inc.</string>        <key>ProductName</key>        <string>Mac OS X</string>        <key>ProductUserVisibleVersion</key>        <string>10.7.0</string>        <key>ProductVersion</key>    <string>10.7.0</string>download jdk1.7 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html and install it. Change the version number back to the original value in SystemVersion.plist file.Then run:Code:export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/HomeThen download and install NRS as per usual. No worries, seems all it needed was a page refresh. There seems to be a problem with software not running over https port 7875. Upon trying to login it just won't load, although when i try to login on the non secure port 7874 it works fine. There are no errors in console.I've now tryed it on my local machine and I'm having the same problem, can't login with on 7875 but 7874 works fine. I've registered an account on Nextcoin.org using idev Cheers, I've now updated my public node to the latest version and set pushThreshold and pullThreshold parameters to 1.

Sent you a pm for a price quote. Why do you keep stating that the company is regulated when in fact it's not. Is it some sort of sales or marketing tactic. Looks like it's not the first UK regulated exchange then. They won't even need to make it illegal as a growing list of foreign owned banks, payment processors and financial companies are already singing kay sera sera to the US. It's amazing that someone is selling this open source script.

Yes it's still in it's infancy but it's usable now and supports multiple OS and it's free and opensource. Caught red handed  Why not try freecoin.io. That TLD is available now as long as you snap it up before someone else does. Indeed. Next thing you know we will need a license to make woopi or to take a dump in the toilet. A question for you sir. Do you have an outstanding issue or problem with FC4B ? ByteMailOfficial project home: bytemailproject.org Link is working for me. Just go to the website and click on the blacklist link in the footer. Be careful of fortatrust they are a terrible hosting provider and they will publish your personal details on their blacklist if you miss a single payment. I had this exact same issue until i obtain some help from Warren Togami Jr over at the LTC forums.My problem was that my previous OSX 10.5 did not run the new LTC update without crashing after a short while.I've since upgraded my OSX to 10.6 and my LTC client runs fine just like how it did before the update.Hope this helps.

You don't need a business to open a skrill account, unless something has changed but I'm pretty sure you don't.With regards to LR, personally I've been using it for well over 5 years and I've have never had my account hacked. (touch wood)I think most people who have their LR accounts hacked are usually victims to the notorious LR phishing emails or some viruses on their own comps.  If you can accept LR or Skrill i would be interested in purchasing the lot. Looks like OKpay has removed Bitcoin as-well. Check out https://www.pond5.com and edit an existing vid theme.

Source: bloomberg It really depends on the hosts AUP, im currently mining LTC on a cloud and my hosting provider has not suspended my account.(touch wood) Yes they did have their VISA, AMEX and MASTERCARD processing halted for a while, but they did managed to get it back on trackand its been working fine since ever since. IMO i think the name change is to help them distance them self from whole Ponzi/Hyip's, Autosurfs, MLM industry that Alertpay had been supporting for quite a while now.  Well due to AP being one of the top payment processors for Ponzi/Hyip's, Autosurfs, MLM and many other types of online money making opportunities, i think they finally decided (or were forced) to stop serving the needs of these types of programs which most probably landed them in some hot water. Hence the re-brand and re-launch to help put its questionable past behind them.

What sort of hash rate will the board be able achieve (sorry if this has been asked before)  Thanks Where ? +1 You can also use vircurex. I think whats needed is more everyday services and products to expand the usage of LTC.and some good and constant marketing to expose the coin to more people interested in alternative currencies.

On July 21, 2011, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published in the Federal Register a final rule on definitions and other regulations relating to money services businesses (Final Rule).1 The Final Rule amended the definition of "money services business" at 31 CFR 1010.100(ff). An entity may now qualify as a money services business (MSB) under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulations based on its activities within the United States, even if none of its agents, agencies, branches or offices are physically located in the United States. The Final Rule arose in part from the recognition that the Internet and other technological advances make it increasingly possible for persons to offer MSB services in the United States from foreign locations.2 FinCEN seeks to ensure that the BSA rules apply to all persons engaging in covered activities within the United States, regardless of the person's physical location.FinCEN is issuing this Advisory to advise financial institutions of their obligations under the BSA when providing financial services to foreign-located MSBs. Financial institutions should note the following:To qualify as an MSB, a person, wherever located, must do business, wholly or in substantial part within the United States , in one or more of the capacities listed in 31 CFR 1010.100(ff).3 Relevant factors include whether the foreign-located person, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized or licensed business concern, is providing services to customers located in the United States.      Foreign-located MSBs are financial institutions under the BSA. With respect to their activities in the United States, foreign-located MSBs must comply with recordkeeping, reporting, and anti-money laundering (AML) program requirements under the BSA. They must also register with FinCEN.4       Foreign-located MSBs are subject to the same civil and criminal penalties for violations of the BSA and its implementing regulations as MSBs with a physical presence in the United States.       The Final Rule requires each foreign-located MSB to appoint a person residing in the United States as an agent for service of legal process with respect to compliance with the BSA and its implementing regulations.      The Final Rule became effective on September 19, 2011. Reporting, recordkeeping and AML program requirements under the BSA now apply to foreign-located MSBs. However, registration and the appointment of an agent for service of legal process will not be required until the revised registration form is available, which is currently planned for release in early March 2012.GuidanceFinancial institutions may find it necessary to update their AML programs if they provide financial services to foreign-located MSBs or engage in financial transactions with these entities.5 Financial institutions may find previously issued Guidance and Advisories helpful when incorporating foreign-located MSBs into their AML policies and procedures. In 2005, FinCEN and the federal banking agencies issued guidance (Joint Guidance) on providing financial services to MSBs operating in the United States.6 Additionally, financial institutions may find FinCEN's 2010 Advisory on informal value transfer systems (IVTS) to be useful in determining if their customers are operating as unregistered money transmitters.7Suspicious Activity ReportingConsistent with the standard for reporting suspicious activity under the BSA, if a financial institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that a transaction conducted or attempted by, at, or through the financial institution involves funds derived from illegal activity or appears to be indicative of money laundering, terrorist financing, or other violation of law or regulation, the financial institution should file a suspicious activity report (SAR).8 As noted in the Joint Guidance, financial institutions that provide banking services to MSBs should file a SAR if they become aware that their customers are operating as unregistered or unlicensed MSBs.9Questions or comments regarding the contents of this Advisory should be addressed to the FinCEN Regulatory Helpline at 800-949-2732. Financial institutions wanting to report suspicious transactions that may relate to terrorist activity should call the Financial Institutions Toll-Free Hotline at (866) 556-3974 (7 days a week, 24 hours a day). The purpose of the hotline is to expedite the delivery of this information to law enforcement. Financial institutions should immediately report any imminent threat to local-area law enforcement officials. Also you have aurumxchange as on option, one can load mtgox codes on to their cards and withdraw the cash from any ATM worldwide. How does one install this on a mac ? This still available somewhere ? Ive seen voucher safe and it looks great, although my system will require no client downloads or installsnor transaction fee's unlike VS.
Yes i understand that,on top of not keeping records, it is also not possible to track payments made with vouchers,nor is it possible to know who owns an actual voucher and or how much balance it made contain.This includes the Voucher Issuer.The system only keeps track of valid vouchers numbers and balances, no actual name, identificationis linked to any vouchers thus making each voucher in circulation anonymous. The only person who will know you own a voucher is a recipient in trade, merchant, exchange.and they will only know once you transact a voucher with them.So it would be impossible to track any payments or to find out who owns an actual voucher or what a balance is on a "said" voucher. My proposed system would also have that 1up over mtgox, as no transaction records are kept.Ive looked at OT before and it does seem very impressive,its just a shame i suck at installs, as i would of liked to try this. Hello BTC'ersNow i know we already have a voucher system in place created by MtGox which works and performs pretty well,but i wonder how the community would feel with another voucher system implementation in place along side the already well established MtGox voucher system.Would you say..OR Would you say..For those who would say "Whats the point, we already have established system that everyone trusts"thanks for your time i guess you won't want to read any further.My proposed system:~SystemEach Voucher is comprised of a unique *33-alphanumerical code*Face value amount - (Displayed in BTC)*Issuance date *(1) year expiration date.The voucher system is centralized and administered by the Voucher Issuer.Each voucher created and in circulation is underwritten 100% at all times by actual Bitcoins held in reserve by the Voucher Issuer.Transactions made with the Vouchers are private, anonymous, in-reserve-able and completely segregated from the Bitcoin Blockchain.so transactions made with the vouchers are instant.In essence the vouchers are a fully Bitcoin backed digital instrument/asset.~How it worksNotes: If you needed to give someone a specific amountfor example: you have a single 10BTC voucher and you need pay someone 5BTC.You would simply split the voucher into 2x 5BTC vouchers, keep one for your self and send the otherto person you need pay 5BTC to.Merchants:The merchant system would be similar to how transactions are handled person-to-person (like above)but for approved third party merchants this would be a automated process of collecting voucher payments for merchantsand giving new vouchers (change) to the merchants customers when need be.~RedemptionTo withdraw the actual bitcoin face value that a voucher has left on it is handled by the Voucher Issuer and or approvedthird party Exchangers, Resellers, Wholesalers contacted to issue and redeem the vouchers~Fee'sThere will be no transaction fee's charged to send or receive payments with vouchers.The only charges associated with the usage of the vouchers will be the issuance and redemption of vouchers fromthe Voucher Issuer and or official third party Exchangers, Resellers, Wholesalers contacted to issue and redeem the vouchers~Pro's*Instant payments*Anonymous*Non-reverse-able *Split, Merge multiple vouchers *Merchant system and customer change - (to do)  *100% Bitcoin backed digital certificate/asset*Fully redeemable for actual Bitcoins*No client downloads or installs needed to use the vouchers.*No website website registrations, logins, username/passwords to remember*Send and receive vouchers in various way IE:email, sms, qr code, paper, voice, fax etc~Con's  MtGox has an establish system already in placeCentralized systemTrust issuers ~Possible solutions  Voucher Issuer is regularly audited by a trusted third party member of the community to prove and provide evidence of physical backing.Voucher Issuer to contract official third party Exchangers, Resellers, Wholesalers for issuance and redemptionservices to distribute trust.I have the system pretty much ready to go but still need to sort out a automated merchant systemand a few other things.Please share your thoughts and criticisms here.Thanks     Its not really that hard at all, in fact you have a quite a few options likenanaimogoldbitinstantaurumxchangePlus some others that i can't quite remember right now.Good luck Wow, what a time for my PS to stop working.Will enter if i can hold of a working copy of PS. I also provide re-loadable virtual visa cards which require no id and are valid for one year. Services available today! Apologizes for missing you there,if your still in need for card services just let me know.Regardsidev  If your still looking i can provide you with the amount you required on the card. So does aurumxchange The closest thing to a BTC debit card is probably aurum xchanges re-loadable  mastercard. Which you can load gox coupons codes on to the card and withdrawthe cash from the ATM. You could use ikobo, and use your credit card to fundan ikobo ATM card which will be sent to your intended recipient. How much LR you need ? That's all at the moment, but thanks for letting me know.

Plus new products added to the inventory, but will be made availableto the wider public soon.Regardsidev No problem.Yes the cards are international visa's available for world wide usage online.I have quite a few customers and have sold many cards at the current ratesto many people, none have commented on the fee's being high, only you guyshere so far.As i also stated in an earlier post, i will be actively seeking new issuersto provide a wider range of cards and additional services with different fee structures in place to suite multiple budgets. But of course this will take time to source and implement before offering the said services to the general public.On another note.Im happy to announce that i have added some new products which will available soon to purchase.New products:*US/CAN Paypal, Alertpay VBA verifications*Paypal instant verification cards.Sales threads for the new additions will be up soon,also the official website is currently being built and hopefully will be ready soonBest Regardsidev  
 Im guessing you must also provide your identification to obtain such cards,with my service no such requirements are needed to obtain any preloaded card up to 2k in balance.With regards to fee's, in all honesty this the first place that i have had received feedback about fee's being a bit high,But i guess each to their own.In the mean time i will look at obtaining other cards from other issuers with different fee's and features and i will also try and re-neg with my current issuer.Regardsidev Services available today Unfortunately, fee's can not be changed due to the fee's imposed by the card issuer,although im willing to provide discounts to regular customers.

Yep its just another glorified Paypal clone with a nicer web design.
Seems it up for sale @ 17,000 EURany takers ? There is no democracy in this world of false flags , END OF.  Thats correct, as using Paypal for e-currency exchanges is against their TOS,in future please do NOT use Paypal for exchanging e-currencies as it more hassle than its worth,If you must use Paypal, please only transact with close friends or family, any other non-trusted partiesis just not worth the risk.

Its seems your not understanding the concept,members can earn btc as a free or upgraded member.Free members can only earn by taking part in the referralprogram which offer 1% referral commission from upgrade purchases made by your referrals.Upgraded members who purchase Ad Share Packs are required to earn 15 credits per day in order to receive2% daily R.O.A, the Ad Share Packs matures when the share has yielded 200% upgraded members also 2% referral commissionsfrom upgrade purchases made by your referrals.Please note:To all members who have signed up recently,you need to assign credits to the websites you have submitted as your website are not being shown to others, so please ensure you allocate the desired amount of creditsto your websites other wise your sites will continue not being shown !! 1) When you register on the site you are asked for your first website to be advertised in the surf rotator,upon login to your account for the first time you will need to surf 5 sites to activate your account and to receive200 ad credits signup bonus.You then assign these credits to the websites you have submitted for the surf rotator, when you site is shown to other members 1 credit is deducted for each view you site receives,while members viewing the sites earn credits for each site they view.2) You are free to have ads on your site but not the type which is mentioned on the signup form ie:  "Popups Or Popunders, Flying Ads, NO Frame Breakers" etc3) Credits are only used for the purposes of advertising your websites and nothing else,to earn daily rebates you will need to upgrade and purchase a min of 1 Ad Share Pack to earn,although this not required, so if you choose to remain a free member you will still be able to earn1% from purchases made by your referrals. Im sorry mate you've lost me ? All pricing is in BTC and not USD. I think it could work with the correct KYC polices in place,but of course this is at cost of anonymity. Its an auto surf site with ptc features.Also just a quick notice to all members who have signed up far,please make sure you add your ad credits to the sites you have submitted for rotation.Failure to do so well result in your site NOT being shown in the surf rotator,all sites submitted so far have been approved !RegardsiDev

Several measures were taken to protect the systems source code, including requiring all Goldman Sachs employees to agree to a confidentiality agreement.....

The men share a common goal: to protect the interests of big banks in the vast market for derivatives, one of the most profitable  and controversial  fields in finance. They also share a common secret: The details of their meetings, even their identities, have been strictly confidential.Drawn from giants like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the bankers form a powerful committee that helps oversee trading in derivatives, instruments which, like insurance, are used to hedge risk....READ MORE All these attacks are false flags to shut down the web,thanks to shittyleaks, the US congress is passing legislation in the lameduck sessions nowto shut down the web, and thats not all, FCC says "free and unregulated media is over and that is has been a privilege for far to long".  Theres no time line bar on this flash player! just play and listen.

3rd col is share price with fee4th col is fee paid on the share5th col is the line of the shareMaybe so if the lists are 2000 persons long, but what you have to understand isthey are many many people purchasing all the time,  like every second and many many people are buying multiple positions at one time so the lines are always moving, also i don't think the lines are 2000 persons long at the moment, i think they are more or less around 200 - 500, but of course im not totally sure as you can only see the top 60 in the list to be paid, but what i do know is that all lines are move fast as i always cycle multiple times in one day, so i don't thing its really that long at the this time. Of course it has to do with where you are on the list, BUT with every 2 purchases someone will cycle, so you will rise up though the list every time 2 spots are paid,what do you mean buy cents? Yes it a pyramid system, but it works so well, as its been online for over 5 years now, many people are making 1000s a dayjust though i would share the site as its a tried and tested money machine. Hello BTC'ers, i know this is off topic and it has nothing to do with BitCoins, but i have to share this AMAZING CASH COW OF A program.The site in question is called cashflowbot Aka DollarMonster, its a straight line cycler program and has been online and paying its members for over 5 years, how does it work? you simply buy a spot in one of the lines ranging from $3 - $400, and when 2 purchase are made in any of the lines, the person at the top of the list cycles and receives double they money back. The wonderful thing about this program is the system is fully automated, meaning no need to request withdrawals or ask admin for your cash, when you position cycles your cash is instantly paid into your AlertPay account, How sweet is that, so for those with some funds in your AlertPay i highly suggest you join the program and start filling your AlertPay with instant cash. Join today www.cashflowbot.comI have made over $1200 with this program in a very short space of time, here are just some of my payout stats  Whats the expiry date please? I can do 100BTC @ $45LR, pm me if you want to deal. You can buy LR at 0% rate @ http://goldexpay.com/ Solor power, or hijack and re-route your neighbors power    Or most likely the Bancor.

Im very keen in establishing this market, my plan is to offer any bitcoin based businesses to purchase shares and publicly establishtheir shares on the market. Investors would then register at the market site and would be able to buy and sell sharesin the companies available on the market. I would have flat share rate for companies purchasing and establishing their entityon the market, something like for 0.01 per share plus a small entry fee, minimum share capital to enter the market is 100.000 shares.I also have found script which could serve the needs and operation of this market, although a few mods will be needed before it could evenbe launched in beta, and of course the demand from potential bitcoin businesses and investors. your welcome   Updated, with correct spelling.

The IMF blueprint, authored by Reza Moghadam, director of the IMFs strategy, policy and review department, has stayed under the radar for three months. However, an article on the Financial Times blog alphaville, entitled IMF blueprint for a global currency  yes really, today highlights the document and the clear strategy of the global financial body. in the eyes of the IMF at least, the best way to ensure the stability of the international monetary system (post crisis) is actually by launching a global currency. Izabella Kaminska notes. And that, the IMF says, is largely because sovereigns  as they stand  cannot be trusted to redistribute surplus reserves, or battle their deficits, themselves. A chart within the document, innocuously titled Reserve Accumulation and International Monetary Stability (PDF link)
