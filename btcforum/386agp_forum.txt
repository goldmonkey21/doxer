Downloaded 0.3 for OSX, have to report it's not working very well, the hard disk goes crazy (so much so you can't really open any other apps, unless you want to wait 5 minutes) and it downloads blocks extremely slowly, took me about 4hrs to download 20k before I gave up. The windows one on similar hardware works 10x faster and I had all 66k done in 15-20mins I think it was.On intel iMac 10.6.4 i5 4gb ram. Oh and it quite often crashes when you quit, is it just me having these problems?Have tried wiping the database and reinstalling the app with no change.
