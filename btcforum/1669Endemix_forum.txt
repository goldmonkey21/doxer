Hello everone, I have been interested in starting a site that exclusively uses bitcoin as a currency. I have done most of the graphics work just need someone to make it a website. The thing is payment would be in bitcoin and come after the site has been running for a bit, to ensure that you as the designer is happy and at ease with this arrangement all payments until you are paid will be routed through you. As in when someone completes and order, you will receive the payment. Keep half of it, send the rest to me and this will continue until you are fully paid.It will need a members/login/signup area that is able to track past orders as well as current orders so the customer will always know what is going on with his/her order with tracking numbers etc. A shopping cart that will be able to be updated/changed to reflect new items, old items and discounts etc.If you are interested please contact me by message on here.
