Ah, awesome. Should have had a look around firstÂ   Not everyone has their own server where they can run the daemon. Additionally, the setup would make it much easier for people that just want to accept payments and automate them and not bother with configuring a special BitCoin daemon. Hey guys, I'm new to the forum and BitCoin, and I'm loving the concept so far!I'm a software developer, particularly web based technologies, and I had a great idea. A system like PayPal but for BitCoin payments.Before you start flaming (central authority), this system would have a shopping cart based system, an API like PayPal's and no transaction fees (except for the transaction fees by the BitCoin network). It would have a UDP API for game-based micropayments, too.You might say; why not let the end-user use the BitCoin API? Well, some people may not have a 24/7 server where they can run the daemon (e.g. shared hosting), additionally, it would be super easy, wouldn't require any programming knowledge (unless they wanted to get advanced).Does anyone else like this idea?
