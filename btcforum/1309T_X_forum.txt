Your website looks awesome, I'm checking it regularly ! I also like that you've added some general bitcoin network related infos, helps keeping track of how dynamic the coin generation is. Would you mind adding graphs for those pieces of network related information over time, too? Some BTC are on the way anyway. Thanks for your effort so far and for sharing it!Cheers, T_X Hope this is not getting too much out of topic, but...cdecker, are you going to be in ZÃ¼rich for a delivery tomorrow, Sat. 18th Dec. afternoon/evening? I'm going to do some required christmas shopping and might be visiting two friends in the city center. It would be awesome to suddenly have an unknown guy turn up with a beer delivery, being paid by bitcoins .If so, I guess we should settle the rest via PM and inform the others later in the forum, if a successful trade could be accomplished .
