YAY.  Fedora users try this binary.  http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/bitcoin-r102 I would hope some real developer fixes this so Fedora and Slackware users can use it.  No telling what other distros it fails on.  What was it built on?  I'm guessing Ubuntu/Debian which in my opinion is the most broken fork existing.  Please guys.  Help us out.Thanks.I'm having my wedding today so I dont have time to code.     I get this when trying to run bitcoin:[michael@fed13 64]$ ./bitcoin./bitcoin: error while loading shared libraries: libcrypto.so.0.9.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directoryFedora 13 uses this:/lib64/libcrypto.so.1.0.0aHow can I get around this?I tried a symlink and running ldd and ldconfig to no avail.Thanks
