Chemo isn't cheap. If you want his work to continue put your dollars and bitcoins to good use:http://freedomainradio.com/Donate.aspx I wrote this essay Tuesday afternoon and it accurately reflected my perception of the mood at the time. It may be slightly inaccurate as of today but I am presenting it as written anyway. Those of us who where paying attention in 2010 were promised the block size limitation was a temporary anti-flooding rule that would be removed when it was no longer needed so that Bitcoin could indeed support higher transaction rates.If the devs changed their minds between now and then they should openly admit this. Publicly say the original plan changed, and why.Â  Stop lying by claiming 1 megabyte blocks were originally intended as an economic feature when anyone can debunk this by reading the old threads.What's most appalling about this debate is the blatant dishonesty by those in favour of leaving the limits in place, even reaching up to some of the most prominent developers. Observing that dishonesty and evasion raises grave doubts in me about the viability of the project, much more so than any external attack. I have him keep an eye out for one. This business is now accepting BitCoins at a new web site: Abel'sFire.com. The owner expects to put a lot more effort into the new web site then previously so you can expect the number of products to increase dramatically in the near term. I am friends with the owner of garagearcade.com and he's expressed interest in accepting Bitcoins as payment. He sells restored arcade games in approximately the $500-$1500 range depending on rarity and amount of restoration work done. This kind of problem is exactly what the PGP "web of trust" attempts to solve.Perhaps that technology could be reused - people who wish to join the web of trust can publish a PGP/GPG key and every person who successfully trades with him or her can sign it.
