I tried to register with the wiki, it said "The user has been created and the password sent by email," but no email has arrived. Then I went thru the registration process again, same username and email, and it didn't object to the duplication (nor sent an email). Suggest you create a means for public input to your dev. to-do list. This could be forum message(s) "pinned" to the top... or a separate forum ... or in the wiki...Maybe break it down a little: interface, core code, network...Here's item 1 for a mac interface list: implement the cmd-H Hide item in the application menu. For mac users who want Bitcoin to hide for now? Option-click on the desktop to hide the front app and go to finder.
