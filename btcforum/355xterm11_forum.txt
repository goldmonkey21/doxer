Wow.  It's been running nonstop ever since I posted.  Still no coins!    Yup, blocks updated, still no $$$. How long does it usually take you guys? At approx. 66k I received a transaction.  Its been running for a while since, but no coins have been generated(even though the block increase slowed to a crawl, so the block list should be updated)  Do you know offhand what the current block count is? I'm assuming 65/70k before  my transactions will show and coins will be generated? As you can see, I have 8 connections, 50k blocks... but no coins or transactions.  What's up?
