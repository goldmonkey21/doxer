Increasing the number of transactions in a block does not increase the amount of time needed to find the solution for that block. +4 REF, see above.  Everything went well, and he even put up with my, at times, excessive paranoia ^.^ Correct.  But it's "An MMORPG".  You don't say the entire acronym out in your head when you read it, hence you pronounce it as if it started with a vowel.  It's the same as something like "Give me an M!  Give me a U!".  M is a consonant, but when you say the actual letter, it begins with a vowel.  U is a vowel, but when you say the actual letter, it starts with a consonant. You don't get charged a fee for generating a block in the future.  YOU get awarded the fee, so it's still a BTC prize. The rules for "A" and "An" are not based on the actual letters, but on whether your mouth starts open or closed on the following word (which USUALLY corresponds to vowel/consonant), and in this case, since you say "Em Em Oh Are Pee Gee" not "morpig" (or something), it is "an MMORPG".  There are some other examples, but they don't come to mind.EDIT: Also, wow, I'm late to the party, I totally didn't realize this was 7 pages long and that I was responding to something from ages ago. But not a finite number of blocks.  After we stop minting coins, there will still be new blocks with transaction fees. I'll buy them at a dollar a piece. Right, forgot that, still, paltry compared to the lure of all the above. E N C R Y P T I O N Yes, the promise of bitcoins, which in TOTAL, at their PEAK was worth less than 40 million dollars (Current Block # * Peak Price) is far more alluring than all of the bank systems relying on SHA256 encryption, all the SSH tunnels to be sniffed, government secrets, crime syndication, encrypted emails, and all the fame of being the one who broke it.Also, nothing says this is the same person.  If it went to multiple addresses, it could very well be multiple people.  If it went to the same address, that could be one of the larger pools' addresses.  The conspiracy theorists in this forum are growing thick as mud.
Hrm, a huge amount of publicity bringing some heavy computing power to the stage, increasing the odds of this happening?  Interesting. No.  It's statistics.  We've been at it 2 years, and there's gargantuan amounts of processing power behind this.  It was bound to happen eventually.Finding a collision isn't breaking SHA256.  Breaking SHA256 (or at least, any manner of breaking that would matter to us) is finding a FAST and EFFICIENT way to find a collision, other than brute forcing.  There is no way to do this that is currently known, and it's stood up to many many cryptographic tests and analysis, people trying to hack it for years. Would you sell the two 5850's individually? Wait, that means... There are MULTIPLE grues around these parts?  I get the feeling I'm about to be eaten... Actually, aren't you? That's not quite accurate.  Miners are tweaking one value in a block of data in order to find any password WITHIN THE DIFFICULTY.  Finding a hash that is lower than a set value is far easier than finding a very specific existing password.  Essentially, cracking the password would be solving the highest difficulty block possible.  (Also, Miners are working on SHA256, much harder to crack than simple MD5...) The thousands of trades was not from thousands of small sell orders, but from thousands of small buy orders.  "I want to sell 1000 bitcoins for 0.01 btc" ends up being (if there is not one large buy order out), "I've been waiting to buy 10 bitcoins at 17.5, gimme" "I've been waiting to sell 5.4 bitcoins at 17.4, gimme", etc.  All trades happened within a single second, because it was simply the mtgox software looping through buy orders and fulfilling them. Everyone is so quick to shout scam, but I feel that term is becoming watered down.  If you were scammed, he would have netted something of value from you, leaving you at a loss.  "Trick" "fooled" and "misled" are more accurate here, as in the end, all you've done is spent 30 seconds of your life giving someone a very very limited amount of publicity. We don't need to do anything to influence the market.  If that is indeed the ideal price, then the price will drop from where it is due to lack of interest, and when it reached that point, merchants would begin trending towards bitcoins for the reasons you suggested.  If the natural equilibrium is higher, market forces will drive it to that in the long run. "These cars things benefit early adopters." Don't forget:The internet is over.-Prince This does not stop someone from changing the:if( verifyOwnership() )    letPlay();to:if( true )    letPlay();through a mixture of stack/trace and reverse compilation.  Simply put, this is the exact reason almost no piracy countermeasure will ever work.  Any code you write to limit the gameplay, check licenses, etc. can be modified in the resulting binary.  You can obfuscate and complicate this process, but as was seen with Spore (which quickly became the most pirated game in existence simply due to spite of the heavy DRM) this just serves as an additional incentive to crackers.  You can trust me.  I'll keep your wallet so secure, even YOU can't get to it.  Everything you've posted is off-topic.  This was about the speculation of one twitter user, not a boasting grounds for you to show of that you know how to use LaTeX. Apparently math is hard, because it's actually 10^133 times harder. Dear god, the cat in your display picture is ADORABLE. The transaction shows where the money originally came from.  I receive bitcoins at Address A.  I send them to Mtgox.  Mtgox sends them to singular address.  Since I know what my address was, and the exact amount I transferred, I know it was mtgox doing the transfer because I can trace the btc back to myself. Ignoring, for a moment, the glaring problems and misconceptions in your paper, it's horribly and arrogantly written.  You wrote down some internal musings that don't really flow into eachother, changed any "I"s to "the author"s, deemed it worthy to slap an abstract on it and convert it to PDF, and have posted it in nearly every thread you've posted in.  To me, It seems you like to play the scholar, and fancy yourself an intellectual without understanding how to write a cogent and thorough paper. More likely, yes, but not the worst case scenario. =P Right, but sans such meta-data, there's nothing that correlates two addresses.
Correction, Worst case scenario: The entropy death of the universe comes hundreds of billions of years earlier than science predicts and we all cease to exist as soon as I post this response. No.  There's no such thing as "retroactively illegal", at least not in the united states.  If the law doesn't exist at the time of the crime, you cannot be convicted for it. I find it funny that just over a week ago, $10 was the ceiling everyone was looking forward to, waiting anxiously for it to get that unbelievably high.  Now, it's doomsday if we hit $10... If you define account as one wallet file, then no.  Each address in a wallet is a single independent public/private keypair.  There's no way to correlate two addresses without resulting to meta-information (having done business with both, tracking the transactions of both, etc.).  You can find out how much is in each ADDRESS, but not how much is in the collection of addresses that a single person owns, since there is no way to know how many or what addresses he owns. Great thing about bitcoins is that there IS no way to print money for a stimulus package.   It'd have to be of the MARKETS choice, not the governments. No.  This is the opposite of a free-market.  This is FAR from bottoming out.  Just take a deep breath and relax. Sure thing!  If you want a clearer explanation, send me a private message.  And don't mind everyone else, they're just super apprehensive because we've been hit by the Trollpocalypse and a slightly tumultuous market.  Granted, I won't begrudge a man his caution... 1) Fair enough.2) I... could not understand a single word of that. 1) It's a moot point, see my above post.2) A DDOS can't endanger someones life... Seriously, where did you go to tech school, because they should lose their accreditation. You can't DDOS a wallet address.  It's not an address on a network, it's simply a private key.  I can create an address with some pen and paper calculations (would be rather hard, since I'm not a computer, but possible), and you could send money to it.  I could, at a later date, inject that private/public key pair into my wallet and voila, I have ze monies.  An address is just the "rights" to spend the money, not some kind of identifying IP address or somesuch. You don't actually have to confirm them at this point, because the coins, in the abstract sense, are there, your client just has to process the block-chain to realize it.  You can try downloading the block chain from someone who already has it through a more direct route (HTTP, FTP, etc), it might be faster.  I might be able to provide a mirror for you if you want.  Just be patient.  While bitcoin is in it's infancy, the client wasn't written for every day use.  It's still not even version 1.0 yet.  In the future, there are various solutions that have been discussed before that will allow pure "thin" clients that rely on a smaller block-chain in exchange for a higher amount of "trust". Wait, there was an ounce of seriousness anywhere in this thread?  How'd I miss that one? o.O Sure, I'm always mining. Guess you could just switch over to Eligius.  They don't even use passwords. I'll do it.  Send me 5% of your bitcoins every day, and don't spend anywhere else.  As long as you follow my instructions, I promise you won't lose more than 5% of your bitcoins per day. Sure, have him send me a private message.  I'll answer any questions I can, and any that I can't I'll refer you to someone who can. There's something like this on a larger scale, called the Test Network.  They use it to test various protocol changeover situations and such.  It'd be interesting to see a project for a smaller, emulated environment on a single machine for client-testing. Here's a block solved by the Eligius pool:http://blockexplorer.com/block/000000000000026210a972387c00e6db801346b32a815a996d698211d71a197cThe software keeps a virtual tally of your unpaid balance.  Once this crosses 1btc, you're paid out on the next generated block, RIGHT there, in the generation block.  The money never sits in some intermediary account held by the pool-owner.  There's a lot less required trust, because while the pool owner can still shut down the pool before you get your "fair share" (aka virtual balance), HE doesn't get anything out of it.  It's a very subtle and clever system, so I suggest you (or the developer) spend some time thinking about it to understand why it truly works, and I won't use a pool without it.  Obviously, you can incorporate the 3% fees as just taking 3% off the top of the generation block to your own address.  Eligius itself has no fees, but since your fees would be going to an actual cause, I might not mind as much. Wow, such a simple idea, I love it.  If you did block payouts like Eligius, I'd totally switch. I lost interest when you used the word "legit".All joking aside, yes, this could be a problem.  It's a problem with any closed source application.  Internet explorer could start blocking webpages it didn't like.  It would make it vastly unpopular very quickly, but it could be done.  It's more subtle with bitcoin, as the effects might be more subtle and take longer to get noticed.  Solution: Don't use closed source clients, and hope that someone develops a really kickass open source client. =P
I made another thread about doing just that.  I'm on a phone, otherwise Id link it, but check my post history and weigh in there. This is more what I was going for.  Explain where the 21 limit comes from, why it was chosen, and what positive effects this has.  Explain and demonstrate the rich and vibrant selection of products that is cropping up around bitcoins, etc. So, with the influx of new people, it occurred to me that a new video (ala weusebitcoins.org) would be very helpful to new members and image as a community, explaining many of the common misconceptions in a visual and digestible format.  I've begun to think about a narration for said video, and my roommate has expressed interest in helping out (he's a full time graphics designer).  I figured I'd help motivate him to spend his free time on the project by gauging community interest in the project.  So the question is: If released on a purely donation basis for the good of the community, would you donate?  If so, how much?Likewise, what topics would the community like to see addressed in this video?  Below is the things I've managed to brainstorm (by no means will everything here be included, just the things that come to mind):The 21 million cap: How, Why, implications, and mythsA more in depth look at the way mining works, and why the blockchain makes the transactions secureLegality issues ("Legal Tender", etc.)Addresses, and common procedures for how to treat your wallet (past mistakes that have cost huge fortunes to be lost)Uses of bitcoins, and why it's not "A vehicle for illegal drugs"Let me know what you think, and maybe I'll be able to kick my roommate into gear in helping me get this developed at a professional quality. [citation needed] If the prices are fair, I'd be interested in this. "Newbie" subforum then?  Unrestricted posting, and allows other members to "vouch" for them and pay their membership fees? Hot chicks?  IN MY BITCOIN?  BLASPHEMOUS! Might be interesting to see a Small btc registration fee (or subscription fee?), combined with a small return when you post something that the community sees as worthwhile, tweaked so that the "average" user makes his money back, and a strongly contributing user can actually make money off well thought out, constructive posts. Noone is making any promises.  Noone is "issuing" currency.  It simply exists as a form of exchange, which satisfies the bill for currency.cur·ren·cy/ˈkərənsē/Noun1.

The fact or quality of being generally accepted or in use. 3 days?  I can't see past 3 minutes.  And even that runs me out of Mana pretty quickly.  You must be a pretty high level... It all makes sense, considering your profile picture...  YOU ARE JOHN TITOR! December 10, 2000 11:32What type of money do you use in 2036?(56) Its not very different than it is now. Yes, we have money and credit cards. However, like everything else, the monetary system is decentralized.(57) Banking is based mostly around the community structure. There are no multinational banking or computerized economic systems. There are also no income taxes. Where are you located?  My mom just offered to make the wedding cake in bitcoins, if you're somewhere she can transport it to easily.  She's been doing cake decorating since 2008, and Pasty in general for 12 years.  She graduated from the prestigious Le Cordon Bleu (before they sold out to the US  We lived in London at the time).  If you're interested, she can send a portfolio, and if you can provide travel accommodations she's more than willing to travel to be a part of this.  She's been increasingly excited about the bitcoin phenomenon since I started with it last year, and wants to do anything she can to help the bitcoin economy grow (and secure some for herself).  I mentioned this in a conversation with her in the context of "look how the bitcoin economy is growing", and she leapt on the idea to do the wedding cake. Trade had some confusion, some fishiness with the tracking number, but got the product when he said I would.  The video card worked great, but the motherboard was the wrong product, kind of pissed me off at first.  He was very accomodating and admitted to his mistake.  Then the clearcoin exchange went down with a bit of miscommunication, but in the end we ended up settling on an exchange that worked for both of us.  I'd trade again for smaller sums to build up trust first.  If you're super paranoid, don't trade, because the complications will give you a heart attack, but you'll most likely get your product in the end. I just spent 50. Dividing a bitcoin does not inflate it's value artificially.  If the value of .5 btc goes up to what 1btc used to be, then it's because of natural market forces.Exchanging a dollar for 4 quarters doesn't inflate the money supply, but arbitrarily minting new dollar bills does. Coins can ALSO be merged in a transaction.  A transaction can take many inputs (100x 0.01 transactions, etc.) and have a single output (1 btc). I pointed this out in another thread (or maybe this one, can't remember), and it doesn't just apply to bankers.  It also applies to financial investment firms, because they can choose to accept their OWN transactions into the block without a fee, thus significantly reducing their cost overhead for investing in stocks and other such things that I don't have a head for.  Don't do pay per share.  Do proportional. You are claiming that the hashing rate has to increase forever.  The bitcoin economy is doomed anyway, under that logic, since there is a finite limit to the processing power of the network, and one day that will be reached.  Stagnation does not equate to a decrease in security.Similarly, a decease in payout doesn't mean that all miners will stop mining.  Just as WE have no proof that what you say is true, YOU have no proof that miners will quit because of a minor drop in profitability.  In fact, we have more evidence than you do, since the profitability of mining has been decreasing for some time now (difficulty rate increase), and us miners are still here.  The fees, however, ARE there, and ARE providing a profit for miners, and ARE increasing over time, and WILL be there based on the current rules.  And, if bitcoin has enough miners that it can't be compromised, it stands to reckon that it has enough USERS to produce a high volume of transactions, such that the tiny amount of fee with each will accumulate to large payouts.  We've provided sample math for you, and you've chosen to ignore it.
We welcome noobs whole heartedly.  How would we expect bitcoin to become a global economy if we didn't want as many new people as we could get?The issue WE as a community are having, however, is twofold:1) The lack of research that goes into a post like this.  MANY MANY of these posts are about issues that have been discussed ad nauseam before. 2) The posts are worded from a condescending stance, in which the original poster KNOWS the flaw is there, and the entire community of people who have been here for two years is too stupid to have seen it.  It's also accompanied by ad hominem attacks on the people ("only an idiot couldn't see this", etc.)Compounding both of these issues is a general pattern of poor communication skills, both in portraying their opinion (this thread, for example) and in comprehending the rebuttles that the community has offered.  THIS is the kind of new community member that we find frustrating, because some of us have been dealing with it for 2 years now.For comparison, see how the original post of this thread could have been worded:The community would have reacted MUCH better to this kind of post, pointing out that there's no inherent competition between miners for transactions:  A transaction can be worked on by multiple miners at once, and as a miner, lowering your transaction fee doesn't bring you any benefit:  It doesn't "bring you more customers" than other miners, and it doesn't make the block easier to solve.  Instead, we saw someone with very little understanding of the bitcoin system approaching us with an arrogant, flippant attitude (either intentionally or unintentionally).  The same kind of reaction happens in mathematics, a well known one being the problem of trisecting the angle, the millenium problems, or perpetual motion.  Many people who are introduced to the problem automatically assume they have a clever way of circumventing it, not realizing that for thousands of years people who are very likely much smarter than them have worked tirelessly on these problems, and it'll take a bit more effort on their part to make any true progress (if any progress at all is possible). I bought bitcoins at 0 dollars.  Had a friend who fiddled around with it a bit, got fed up with it, and gave me his remaining 8.95 bitcoins (worth about .8 cents at the time) for free.  Does this count?  =) No problem.  I'm always trying to help new people out... Sometimes I come off as snarky or confrontational, but that's not my intent, on top of which I have very low tolerance for belligerence and what I call "The throughput" (see: him), an archetype for new people that tends to be really stubborn, poorly spoken, and has very little grasp for the concepts of bitcoin.  Other than that, we'll get along great.  Please see this for ego boost.     Send bitcoins from Wallet A to Wallet B.  Problem solved.   Create new wallet.  Send bitcoins from Wallet A to Wallet B.  Problem solved.    Because it's not implemented in the client, as the client hasn't even hit version 1.0 yet.  It's the network, not the client, that is the clever part.    You can.    Because each person owns and is in charge of his own money.  It's not pull-based, it's push-based.  It's one of the strongest consumerist protections around.    Because there's no central authority to do this.  Because noone has an expensive contract with a credit card company.  Because this isn't what bitcoins is about.    You can.  Share the wallet.    You can.    You can.    You can.    You can. That doesn't guarentee they'll get the money though, that guarentees you're approved and under your credit limit.  You can dispute the transaction, and for relatively small amounts the credit company will just give it to you, and the store can't really do anything because taking you to court would be too expensive.  Do it too frequently, though, and your credit card company will start bringing you up on fraud charges. See http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=11814.0 (near the bottom) Rather, at the time, he said it was a standing offer.  And yes, he has since rescinded this. I love all of you, except for some of you. Please, point out your problems with the issues as I have presented them.  [hypocritical ad hominem]Or did you not read my posts because they were too long and hard to understand? [/hypocritical ad hominem] I know, and he offered to do it any time.   I was being snarky. Just thought of something else:The kind of people who have the resources for massive bitcoin mining servers are likely to be large financial investment firms.  It is very much in their interest to keep mining, as, essentially, their entire company can perform transactions on the bitcoin network without any fees, as long as it's solved by their own server.  This would be HUGE savings for the firm, likely doing high volume microtrades on thousands of stocks, on top of the income from the fees themselves.  So we've got an example of secondary or tertiary motivational factors. Yea, I honestly think this was a kind of critical moment for the bitcoin economy, and it would have struggled far more than it did without some kind of transaction like this.  It's almost as if laszlo "sacrificed" himself for our future survival...*starts writing this down.  Hell, it can't be more far fetched than Scientology...* 180 grand. Your assumption that bitcoin derives it's value solely from security is false.  A large part is the security, yes, but it also derives from:Convenience.  It's DAMN easy to send someone a bitcoin.Intrigue. The concept is really clever.Freedom to property.Cost. It's a LOT cheaper to send someone internationally 1btc than it is 20 dollars.If the hash rate decreases (or stagnates), that does not guarantee that someone will be able to overwhelm the network instantaneously.  They still have to ACQUIRE a substantial majority of the networking power.  At the CURRENT volume of miners, that's more than the top 500 supercomputers combined.  In a stable, vast reaching economy, "competition" (I use the word here for lack of a better term, not to imply that block solutions is a race) for the block solutions would be extremely high, and thus there would be several hundred times more computing power devoted to bitcoin.Transaction fees will more than cover the costs of incentivizing miners, as I outlined above.  What you seem to think is that the value of bitcoins at this point will be extremely fluid:  A TINY decrease in security will cause mass panic and devalue the currency, causing a cascade.   Bitcoins will become stickier than that.  In the same way that you cannot notice a 100w lightbulb among 100 other 100w lightbulb, there's a certain point at which the fluctuation of security in the system is undetectable.  The value of bitcoins will stabilize.  The value of a dollar is not subject to stock-like panic swings, and in the presence of a rich economy, neither will bitcoins.Similarly, the security of the system as a whole is subject to the same sensory threshold phenomenon.  The difference in security between 100THash/s and 99THash/s is not equivalent to the difference in security from 2THash/s to 1THash/s.  Just because it drops by 1 THash/s in the future doesn't mean it will have the same risks assosciated with dropping by 1THash/s today.Finally, someone with substantial control of the computational power of the network has only limited attack vectors on the system.  He can claim he did not spend money which he did for limited amounts of time.  The longer in the past he wants to rewrite this "history", the harder it takes, and he can never say that you gave him coins that you did not.  The likely payoff for this in regards to the amount of computing power it would take to compromise a vast system that satoshi envisioned as a stable, worldwide economy would arguably not be worth it.  Seemingly against intuition, and in one of the most beautiful aspects of the bitcoin system, when dealing with the types of resources required to complete these attacks, it's likely more profitable to be honest than it is to be malicious.No, the difficulty would also adjust down.  It's adjusted such that a block is generated roughly every 10 6 10 minutes, ad infinitum. (Woops! hehe) (Woops again!  That's what I get for trusting other people, eh? ) http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=137.0 So much ad hominem it hurts.Listen, the hashing rate doesn't need to INCREASE to maintain security.  If the hash rate remains constant, the security of the network remains constant.For the past several months (probably more like the entirety of the project), the reward for mining has been decreasing substantially, due to the difficulty rate increasing.  Higher difficulty, less payout for miners.  This hasn't created a "catastrophe", or you wouldn't be posting on this forum.  In a stable bitcoin economy, the transaction fees for block generation will far outweigh the amount generated by block creation:  100,000 transactions in 10 minutes would mean 500 bitcoins at the new, reduced transaction fee.  And 100,000 is roughly the number of credit card transactions per minute... JUST in the US.  The system was designed to be a _lasting_, _stable_ economy, and has made assumptions as such.  Bitcoin will never reach it's true potential until it becomes one, and that's the goal of the project, so why design it otherwise?Inflation, on the other hand, is a very real problem, and has caused the outright destruction and mayhem of many massive economies (Germany, Russia, and I'm sure other forum members can provide other examples.)  If bitcoin was not designed to avoid these catastrophes, what would the point of it all be? My cpu gets 10 MHash/s ಠ_ಠ 
? That would be a digital mechanical turk, not a decentralized currency.  How would you actually make the payments?  The WHOLE point of bitcoin is to create a verifiable history of transactions so that you can prove you own the coins you own.  This problem solving system you propose has nothing to do with that.  Awarding people bitcoins for doing work is COMPLETELY secondary to the main purpose of verifying (I like to picture it as shutting the lock on a clear box that you can look into, but not modify, like a growing matrioshka doll.).  The awards are simply to incentivize people to actually do this verifying, to keep the system stable.  The system could equally have been developed with all coins in existence in the genesis block, and awarded to one person, and the fundamental ability to TRANSFER value through them would remain unchanged (a far more inelegant solution, as satoshi has to spend all the coins for them to get into circulation, and noone has any incentive to run a miner, but the core double-spend prevention would STILL WORK.) This has been brought up hundreds of times (literally almost the first thing that everyone says after reading about bitcoin is this very thing).The problem with this is that the inputs to the calculation have to intimately rely on the current state of the network: The previous block, the transactions waiting to be performed, etc.  If we used the travelling salesman problem in some contrived situation where the "solution" of the previous block was the starting position, the transactions were each a point to be visited, etc. we'd essentially still be wasting CPU cycles, as the chances of this data corresponding to otherwise useful data is very very low.  Likewise, the solution has to be extremely sensitive to the initial conditions, in that a slight variation produces a vastly different solution.  This is required to detect people attempting to forge blocks.  The difficulty isn't solely to limit the inflow into the system, but ALSO to cryptographically provide proof that a majority of people on the network agree that THIS set of data is the truth, and not the fallicious block that someone is trying to pass off on you.  Hey, wanna throw one together for my game development company, "Spin Works"? =)  I was thinking it'd be awesome to have an ambigram, but see what you can come up with.  That'd be awesome!  TIL If bitcoins hits that, I will die. DON'T WORRY GUYS, THE BLOCKCHAIN.  WE CAN BACKTRACE IT! You're also responsible for plagarism, identity theft, credit card fraud, access to state secrets such as nuclear launch codes, reading your neighbors mail, Conspiracy and treasonous plans for mass murder, expressed intent and detailed plans to produce nuclear devices, etc. =P And you're in luck, Tomorrow is Graduation for MIT students, and so it's going to be the busiest day of the year at my work. Can I write it on my arm every day for a certain period of time? (A month might be unhealthy, but it's better publicity because people see it and think "... wtf is that written big and black with a sharpie on his arm?".  I'll provide pictures. Haha. The problem is in the transfer of funds.  Also, what you've described is a SECURE transaction, not an ANONYMOUS transaction.  With bitcoin, you can transfer money to someone whom you have NO idea who they are (plausible deniability) etc. Blocks contain transactions.  The fact that a block contains them "verifies" them.  A transaction is generated by someone saying "I want to send coins."  Have a look at http://blockexplorer.com/, gives some pretty useful block data. Transactions. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree Heh, I wonder if it's possible to create a block without the generate transaction? It's so that, if the code changes down the line, we don't automatically reject this one because it's slightly different and thus don't recognize it.  The code can look back and say "Oh yes, for version 1, this is how blocks were done, so it's valid."This comes from your local copy of the block chain, which you in turn got from someone else on the network solving the block.That ones a bit confusing and has to do with verifying all the transactions in the block more efficiently.  google "merkle tree".It's a weird hybrid "agreed upon" time that is calculated based on what other nodes on the network are saying the time is, so everyonearrives at kind of an "average" time.This comes from everyone agreeing (essentially) on what the difficulty should be because of the rate that blocks are being solved at.This is the magic number that you change in order to try and make the hash of the whole thing less than the difficulty.  Essentially, you start at 0, change it to 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. until you find a valid block.You identify the block "creator" by whoever was awarded the 50 bitcoins in the first "generation" transaction. Nah, they're saying that there's no more bitcoins in the bitcoin economy.  That's it folks, shows over. =( The block chain must still be downloading, or you have a different wallet in the client than contains that address. Really?  I thought that was only on SHA1 or MD5...
Yea, bitbills are good.  The "put a wallet on a USB stick" is not. There's ALSO always this point to consider: This doesn't stop it from getting spent from a) a different address, b) as soon as it's shipped off.  Person verifies it's still in wallet.  They purchase the data stick.  I ship it off at 3 days shipping.  On day 2, i spend the coins from my copy of the wallet, through an alternate address.  Stick arrives and is in perfect condition, but the bitcoins are gone from the wallet.  Ebay won't cover this, as you payed $890 for the physical device, a flash drive, and they make no guarantees about the data on it. Problem with this is that there's nothing stopping you from keeping a copy of the wallet and spending them as soon as you shipped off the flashdrive.  On ebay, you're only allowed to sell physical products, and they won't cover the value of the bitcoins with their insurance, only the arrival of the actual product itself (the datastick). Yes, because the raw coal used to fuel forges for HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BANKS ACROSS THE WORLD is less pollutionary than 1 years worth of mildly increased electricity usage.  Not to mention the pure GAS GUZZLERS that are required to carry massive amounts of steel and specialized machinery required to produce such secure bank vaults.Quit this purely conjectural bullshit and show some actual numbers.There is 39.3 kJ/g energy from combusting coal.  It releases 2.0 grams CO2 per gram of coal. (sourceUsing this graph, and finding an approximation on wolfram alpha (notice that 1*10^12, or 1 thash/s lines up at a relatively easy to judge spot on the curve, and i'm going from 0 to 85.134 where the graph is equal to 4*10^12, or 4thash/s, the estimated value right now), we find that the average value is 363.637 ghash/s over 2 years.  Using the calculation here, 31.42 billion MHashs/day * 0.024 kWh/day per MHash = 754 million kWh or 2714000000 megajoulesConsidering steel requires roughly 8,000 MJ/ton of steel to produce, the entire energy used in the bitcoin network could produce 339250 tons of steel.Considering there are a staggering number of secure vaults (In the hundred thousands across the world), each of which is several hundreds of tons, 300,000 tons of steel doesn't seem like much.  And that's not even accounting for the mining, shipping, construction, the energy used by security systems, etc.EDIT: Dear god I spent way too much time on that. If you want, I can do a breakdown of why the smaller pool "Eligius" is better and deserves your attention... I highly suggest you research Eligius.  Their payout system is far more intelligent and secure, rather than trusting the pool operator of btcmine.  They offer more transparency, which will cause a greater confidence in your business proposal.Also, may I buy one share?  Attacking the algorithm used to generate public keys in order to find the private keys would be what he's talking about.  If you found an efficient way to "crack" these, you could steal arbitrary numbers of bitcoins.  The possibility of this happening, however, is slim to none. What would you price be if you didn't have to ship it? So, it was gut-instinct?  Carry on then.  I thought you were trying to say that SHA256 had an 80% chance of remaining secure, and there's simply no data to support that. This also assumes that miners are directly converting their bitcoins to USD.  In all probability, with the volatility of the market, by the time we reach some kind of equilibrium (become a "sticky" currency (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_%28economics%29), then miners will be dealing directly with bitcoins themselves to pay for most of their expenses, rather than having to convert them to some other currency. Dear god, posts like this are getting created faster than blocks on the network. >_>The bitcoin network is built on battle-proven technologies such as DHT and SHA256.  Tor, Gnutella, and hundreds of banking, gaming, encrypting, transfer protocols, security measures, SSL, etc all use the same principles that bitcoin bases its security off of.  I doubt bitcoin is going to provide much more motivation than the banking credentials of the entire world for someone to find a flaw, so this isn't bitcoin related.  If someone could have done it by now, they would have.  If a new attack vector becomes discovered, bitcoin is the least of our worries.  So yes, it's fairly secure.Also, usually I'm not a stickler for this, but really, there's a post on the FIRST page about this.  http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=10661.0Now, why are you throwing random, arbitrary percentages around?  I'd like to see how you arrived at that number (unless you admit that it WAS arbitrary and gut-instinct, then I'll let it slide. ) Yes sir, Mr. Forum Police Chief Sir! You're going to be one fat pig, there seems to be an endless supply of them. =(  (Also, don't I remember you around here from last july/august?  I haven't been around at all, just got back into the community) We can implement this without having to switch over to a new block chain.You missed the entire point.  Mining is definitely NOT to distribute the currency evenly, that defeats the purpose of an economy.  The entire system RELIES on mining. "I solo mined block ______" would also be pretty e-peen worthy.   You should offer the "I bought this when bitcoin was worth..." shirts! BitRapture. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Cryptanalysis_and_validationSHA256 isn't JUST used in bitcoin.  It's used in SSL, in banks all over the world, wireless encryption, cellphone encryption, encryption/verification for thousands of open source projects, etc.  If you need a citation for it's strength, it's been used for 10 years in all these fields without any likely attack vector found. Er... No... bitcoin is dead, but i'll buy all your bitcoins for $1 each.
Ultimately, it looks like he's some young hotshot who thinks he understands everything, considers himself a "hacker", and thinks he can best the worlds top mathematicians because he's 2 years into an associates degree at a shitty college.  I am dissapoint. Looking at how he "thinks" his solution will work, He doesn't understand the concept of destructive operations.  Think of it this way: The simplest hash function is %2.  Basically, given any input, find the remainder after you divide by 2.  It simplifies things down to a keyspace of 1 bit, and obviously there's lots of collisions.  However, given that information, there's no way to go backwards to the original number.  If I say the "hash" is 1, it could be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.SHA256 has the following destructive operations:6x non-carrying additionShift rightI believe the combination of ANDs and XORs ends up being destructive.That's just in one iteration, and there are 64 iterations per hash. If he succeeds, bitcoin compromization will be the least of our worries.  SHA256 has stood up to mathematical analysis for many years, not just from the bitcoin community but from the entire world. Actually, I love this idea haha.  Though, I think it'd be cooler to print shirts with the current price as you sell them, so people wouldn't have to deal with it, or couldn't forge it. Technically, the CPU power used when attempting to solve a block keeps it competitive.  THAT'S the value you add when you don't solve a block.  Which is ridiculously low when CPU mining. What kind of hashing rates are you getting on the other cards of that type? You don't happen to know what the hashing rate on these are, do you? Bitcoder: If you get any requests for projects that are out of your scope, You can hire me as a co-developer.  Wait, new york?  Can I pick it up in person?  I'm in Boston, and I'm going to school in NY soon, been planning a trip out there to see the campus anyway. Payable in bitcoins?  What's the cheapest shipping method you offer to Florida? What are you charging on top of that for the shipping? Where are you located, so I can judge shipping costs? I'll take some too.  100 please.  (Just kidding, of course.) Nice way to backtrack.As for your argument against my English, the point of language is to communicate.  If my sentences communicate my ideas cogently and concisely, then I consider it to be good English.  Excessive perfection of grammar and spelling is only something for uptight literature snobs to occupy themselves with.  You, however, are having difficulty both communicating your ideas and understanding the points that everyone else in this forum puts forward.  THAT is poor English, not misconjugating a negative gerund or misplacing an apostrophe at 3:30am.  Keyword most.  It seems like people like this have been cropping up since bitcoin began.  I remember a year ago having almost the exact same discussion with someone (even back then, when bitcoins were just barely worth more than the electricity it took to mint them, and everything was done on the CPU's and kilahashes.)They all have a few similar features.1) Very Poor English.  I think this leads to a lot of friction for them learning about how the system ACTUALLY works, for communicating their ideas well, or from considering the points that people rebuttle with.2) A fundemental misunderstanding of economics/bitcoin.  "mining" being a scam?  The Mining is what holds the whole system together, what makes it cryptographically secure and worthwhile to begin with.  Maybe if you understood the whitepaper, or read a bit of the code, or took 30 seconds to think about WHY these choices were made, you'd understand that.3) An unending, unquavering, unpersuadable attitude towards "the bitcoin doomsday" or "the Great Unjustice".I wonder if Bitcoin, due to it's complicated nature, is doomed to be perpetually fraught with these "Throughput"s?  (Have a read of http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=547.0 for a good laugh.) What price are you looking at? Anyone have a confirmed trade with you?  Do you have anything to point to for your reputation? Not to hijack your thread, but while dgamer5000 is unavailable due to workload, if you have any other requests I'm also a very experienced C# programmer (C++ for 6 years, then switched to C# for the last 5). Almost, but one minor caveat: The group with more people/miners would be accepted as the proper block chain.  If mexico had more users in their network than the US (given the relative sizes of the countries, I doubt it) then it would be the US transactions that would need to be re-validated.
I first read this as you betting 500,000 and 360,000 bitcoins and choked on my drink. I think YOU'RE missing the point.Tell me, what sinister things can he do with this 20% of bitcoins?  They don't grant power over your money.  They don't grant super powers.  Bitcoins, in and of themselves, are absolutely useless.  I could control 99.9999% of the economy, and they themselves would be useless.  I can't use them to alter the block-chain.  I can't use them to kill your unborn children or force you into slavery.  The worst I can do with them is spend them on some commodity, (and it's not like there are bitcoin-hitmen out there) or exchange them for another currency, which is limited by peoples willingness to do so. What kind of hashing performance were you getting with that specific card? ... Hashes per second?  1 FLOP is Float Operation, and there are many float operations per hash, so it's kind of a misleading unit of measurement when talking about network performance. I've not been able to log in for a while, thought it was just a lack of implemented control console.qrebound@gmail.com I'll donate a tiny percentage each time I reach my payout threshold.  Got it solved, thanks. =)Just required a driver update.EDIT:So, I'm getting roughly 6 MHash/s on my Quadro FX 770M.  Is this normal? ( couldn't find it in the comparison thread... ) Update:So I found out I have an OpenCL video card and didn't know it, but the GUI is reporting that I don't.  Also, I tried running poclbm.exe directly, and got this error:Traceback (most recent call last):  File "poclbm.py", line 3, in <module>  File "pyopencl\__init__.pyo", line 3, in <module>  File "pyopencl\_cl.pyo", line 12, in <module>  File "pyopencl\_cl.pyo", line 10, in __loadImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.Just updated to the latest version of python, still no dice. The password is right, (compared it in the console), and it was working fine on another computer I configured it on (different network, so maybe that's the problem...).  Does the program require any connectback functionality?  I can telnet out to port 8882, but if it's trying to connect to me on any port, that's going to be a problem. Hey, haven't read through all 23 pages, but is there a known issue with being stuck as perpetually "connecting..."?  just doing CPU mining (sadly no OpenCL GPU here...) and it's just perpetually stuck "Connecting...". Jeez, why so hostile? =( Hiding?  I'm right here, how is that hiding.  You seem pretty eager to blame someone else... So would say a wolf when cornered... *glare* Me?!  Kiba was the first on scene.... Who's to say he didn't kill him, and shout for us to belay suspicion of himself? You guys are still arguing with this buffoon?He's arguing that the system should be secure even if the majority of people are compromised.  There's no way to control that.  If over half the people in the entire US economy conspired to specifically thwart the others, they would succeed.  If over half the computers coordinated to falsify the internet, they would most likely succeed.  But, if you control over half the internet, what's the point of subverting it?This very fact is what MAKES it decentralized:  The majority controls the system, not some subset/minority of the population.  Not even to mention the fact that 51% would probably be insufficient to overpower the system convincingly, as it's still dependent on luck. Some English teacher be crying,and our limericks she is decrying,and while they are sad,(some even quite bad),we will never, ever stop trying. =/ I've always just run a single program, Avast... Never malware bytes, avg, etc. etc. etc.I've never had a virus, except once, and I can't really count that because I intentionally infected my computer to watch what the virus did heh.  I never understand why people have such trouble with viruses, since I run with very minimal protection and get away scott free... Not only does it allow it to drop reserved fields, but it uses ZigZag encoding and some other tricks to keep integers and the like as absolutely small as possible.  So yea, it uses clever encoding. =P  It's also blazingly fast to process! Fucking win. Meh, there have been SOME politicians who are honest.  Granted, they're few and far between, but Colonel Allen West, from Florida, is one example of someone who has a long history of being a man of integrity.
FFFUUUUUUUU...Just one more reason to vote in November. Brre: Your client will relentlessly broadcast that transaction into infinity until it's accepted.  It's VERY persistent.A block just probably hasn't been solved in two hours.  The difficulty's up there, I know that. Poor example, because there IS nothing better.  The 21 million is a hard cap that we'll eventually reach.  The number of bitcoins in circulation for 2010 is (roughly) 2620800 coins.Each block generates 50 coins.In 2 weeks, 2016 blocks (should) be generated.In a year, there are 26 "2weeks".50*2016*26 = 2620800The idea of increasing the supply of money relative to time span, population, transactions, etc. has  been discussed at length. The transaction will be accepted into a solved block if the person who solves said block chooses to incorporate your transaction into his solution.  That means it needs to propagate across the network.  Is your "Connections" greater than 0? The whitepaper refers to no central authority in the system.  The algorithm and protocol set forth by the whitepaper DO have no central authority, as anyone can write a client for the bitcoin network.  The fact that there's only one community of developers right now is not a flaw in bitcoin which makes it "only partially decentralized", but a flaw in the breadth and scope of it's current community.For example, let's suppose some common technology or product hadn't been invented yet, say, telephones.  If they were invented tomorrow, and someone started selling them, there would be only one company producing and selling them.  By your arguments put forward, you would classify this as a monopoly.  While in the strictest sense of the word it is, when taken in context it is not, because there's been no CHANCE for competition to be established.  Soon, more companies will start selling phones, and more people will start buying them.  Some providers might change the underlying technology of the phone to, for example, be encrypted, or transmit data wirelessly.  They're still phones, but the original company has no more "centralized control" over them than satoshi will have over bitcoin, should it take root.If you want to see a list of known threats and their risks, read the forums.  There's plenty of discussion about 50% attacks, cracking the hashing problem, the factoring problem, DDOS attacks, etc. The "They" in that sentence was those who wrote the tests.The fact of the matter is, by throughput's reasoning, there will ALWAYS be a central authority, because he's twisting and bending the term "decentralized" to unreasonable extents.  Eventually, you reach the point of "Well, I'm trading with someone else, aren't they the central authority of my transaction?  Aren't I the central authority of my own funds?  Isn't the people who exchange bitcoins for USD a central authority?" So who develops the tests?  Wouldn't they become some central authority? Classical computers work linearly, executing a specific set of instructions.  Quantum computing works by setting up a "situation", and then letting it evolve naturally in a quantum physical way, exploring multiple solutions at once.Think of it like this:  A classical computer acts like a plinko machine.  You put a ball at the top in one of the possible positions, and it clunks down each step until it gets to the bottom.  A quantum computer puts a ball at the top in EVERY position, and lets it fall, until it finds the best one.The trouble is setting up the situation in a very careful way, such that the interferences between different particles is used to your advantage in the calculation. Very similar to the one I've been using, actuallyCode:echo offcd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin"echo Bitcoin Instability Manager:loopstart /wait Bitcoin.exeping -n 1 -w 5000 1.1.1.1 >NULdate /tdate /t >> log.txttime /ttime /t >> log.txtecho Bitcoin crashed, restarting it.echo Bitcoin crashed, restarting it. >> log.txtecho. >> log.txtgoto loopThen you have to run it as administrator (Win7 anyway) so that it can write to the log file.I also had to follow this: http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2009/08/12/disable-program-has-stopped-working-error-dialog-in-windows-server-2008/ (ignore the first command) to get it to work, as when it would crash, that dialog would pop up and prevent the program from fully closing (thus not allowing the batch file to continue).  Woops, didn't check the forums for 2 days >_>Also, if I were to run an actual microlotto, this would all be automated, so you'd know if you won or not right away ( which would make it a bit more addictive, me thinks  ) \o/ I made 2.9 bitcoins  My apologies, I meant "unless someone cracks the factoring problem OR can solve the hashing problem instantaneously".  I can see where my comment might have been misleading. Once it's fixed or proven not to work, could you post the details here?  I'm very curious. =) Red: That's the whole point of the multiple addresses.  You can send from any of them, thus they can't be linked together.  Having everyone know about every transaction is required of the algorithm to keep everything secure. I absolutely hate Ubuntu, mostly because of the community surrounding it.  I much prefer gentoo, Debian, etc. I agree in that The largest benefit is obviously solving a block.  That adds X value to the system.  But simply running it (providing not only "potential solutions", making a hacker work harder to increase his possibility of getting the block, but also providing a stronger communication mesh for the distributed propagation of blocks/transactions/etc.) adds .001 * X to the system.  It's small, but it's SOMETHING. And if we find a far cheaper substitute for gold, which accomplishes all those aspects of N?  It's N value would disappear, leaving only a small amount of value for "purists" who only deal with gold, etc.Bitcoins are a novelty.  People want them because "Hey, this is a cool concept".  They want them because of it's decentralized, non-fiat, non-fractional reserve nature.  That would be non-monetary value. No, even trying adds more CPU power to the system.  Even if someone never solves a block, they're still trying.  That means they have the potential to solve the block, and a potential attacker has to put more resources in order to make sure he solves it first.  Again, it's not much, but it's still a minor factor. Oh, right, hadn't realized it was at 10/min.  Still, it's a whole lot slower than when I started generating, so yea, it's supposed to be this hard. =P
Likewise, if he TRIES to verify blocks, it adds just that much CPU to the system, and puts us one small step further away from a 51% CPU attack.  It's small, but it's the aggregate difficulty that matters. "completely distributed" and "need a small list to start with" are mutually exclusive.  If you need a small list to start with, that's your single point of failure, and should those go down, you're completely locked out of the network.  Same with IRC.  It's EXACTLY like IRC, except that in IRC the list is a live snapshot of who's really on the network.It's not any better than the current IRC method.  IRC is an extremely lightweight protocol to implement.IRC is only used for the initial connection or two.  After that, it communicates with those it connects to in order to find more, exactly as described in your system. Well, I wasn't talking about people using the system.  That's a whole 'nother variable.  You can use the system without generating blocks. 233232223323023 Starting to heat up, the pot is now almost 3 times what it started as. =P 680, then 608? >_>  *buys 068 086 806 860 608 and 680* Since I chose the same numbers for first and second lotterys, can I re-choose 5 different numbers? >_> We've still got 1060 something blocks to go before it readjusts difficulty.Also, while I don't believe his claim on how MUCH BTC he got, I still believe he had the 1000 cores crunching on it.  Also, there's MAYBE 1000 cores generating BTC =/ The user base isn't THAT big yet.So, did he generate ungodly amounts of BTC?  No.  Did he put enough CPU into the system to disrupt the difficulty process, which has yet to adjust back downward? Yes. Bogus blocks? o_O No, he had something.  Otherwise the difficulty wouldn't have increased so significantly. Yea, we still haven't gotten easier since nenold withdrew his 1000 cores. *crosses fingers* ^.^ You have a lot more patience than I do... >_> ... No, I don't get your point.  I'm done arguing with you, you seem to be incapable of processing information. what? Who said I was donating anything?  I'm so confused XDAlso, there's nothing really from us all agree to start another blockchain if this happens.  It'd have to be a majority thing, and everyone would have to start "recognizing" the old block chain and rejecting it (it'd have to be hard coded), or refuse to communicate with old clients... It'd be difficult, but there's always a reset button if we REALLY need it and can all agree on it. This might be more successful with a smaller range (1-10, or 1-20) etc. Ah, yea, that'd work. =)Feel free to donate money   Lemme know, I'll sell you every coin I have. And when people start noticing that it's been hijacked, they'll make posts on forums, and that general knowledge will pass by word of mouth and people will stop using it.Just because we're not trying to "prove" to you that it's valid/invalid doesn't mean we won't say "Uhhhh, I wouldn't use this anymore."As less people use the client, it will become less valuable to use.  Thus, the people who DON'T listen to word of mouth will have no point to use it. How would that work?  How do you distribute money over all existing bitcoins? >_> If someone launches a simultaneous attack on an entire community, there are larger concerns than bitcoin being compromised.  This would require government cooperation between at LEAST 5 countries (maybe more), operating with complete precision, outside the bounds of the law, and violating personal liberties.  Like I said, in that case, bitcoin would be the least of our issues.What does it matter if that person meant to or not?  If the code is bad, we don't accept it, regardless of if it was malicious or not.Given that we have a complete history of the code, we can compare VERY specifically the areas that changed.  We know what it did before, and that specifically highlights the areas that changed.  It's unimaginably hard to hide something malicious in a couple lines of code under close scrutiny.Again, what does it matter who's responsible?  Bad code, don't use it.  If it happens repeatedly from the same person, just stop using their code base.Again, see above.That's my whole problem with your posts.  It's nothing but vague generalities, backed up by nothing but your own whim in creating fantastical and inaccurate situations in your head.Not everyone who reviews the code is a developer who supports the system.  Some people want to specifically see it fail, and are looking for any excuse to point out a flaw.  Again, see above about the simultaneous hijacking.There isn't one dev "team".  I'm not on a "team" with satoshi any more than I'm on a "team" with the microsoft developers.  Just because we're both programmers doesn't mean there's "one team".If you're going to follow that logic, isn't there only one "team" of people who use the software?  Doesn't that make everyone who uses it but ISN'T a coder a central authority?
Not so much angry, just irritated by your speech pattern.  You waltz in, claim that "we're not really decentralized" without understanding how it works.EVERYONE has permission to modify the code, and EVERYONE has the CHOICE to choose what they run.    There is no "central authority".  There just happens to be one person right now who provides bitcoin source.  If that were interrupted, either the system would die, or someone else would take up that mantle.  That fact isn't "too obvious to discuss further", you're simply not understanding the idea behind Open Source Software. We have people here who review the code for differences each time an update is released.  I have begun doing this as of the last release. There are two types of changes that such an impersonator could make:1) Non-breaking change.  A change can only be non-breaking if it cooperates with existing clients.  It can only do this if it follows the mathematics of the system, because anything which changes the mathematics will be rejected by the other clients.  There is absolutely no threat from a breaking change, unless someone cracks the factoring problem and can solve the hashing problem instantaneously, in which case we have bigger issues to worry about.2) Breaking change.  This changes the protocol or mathematics of the way the client operates.  Thus, other clients will refuse to work with newer clients.  This raises huge red flags.  This is the only kind of change which could potentially allow said power to compromise the system.  If someone releases a breaking change, I'm sure as hell going to read the code in order to find out what changed.  I'm sure there are many others who would do so as well.  Through open communication, word would spread of this, and releases from said power would no longer be trusted. Hepatzion: Still, even if 50% of the clients took on a new system, the old clients could maintain their own sub-economy if they so choose.  A merchant can refuse to sell/buy from "version 9" clients, and only deal with people earlier.  While this would cause the economy to be fractured, it'd still prevent a complete dictatorial takeover of the system.  Those who didn't like the changes in the new code COULD, by choice, choose to not use it, and maintain the current economy.  There's no central authority who will arrest/enforce you to switch to the new system. The very fact that we discuss the rules disproves you.  If satoshi was the "central athoritative provider", what point would there be discussing?  We simply ask satoshi to implement it, because he's most familiar with the code and because he's willing to do so.  We're the ones with the power to change the system, as WE'RE the ones who choose which client to run.  Case in point, Olipro wrote his own code to change the system that many of us are now using, converting it to 64 bit calculations.  Is he, also, in control of "all the power"?Stop with your doomsaying and incoherent nonsense, and put forth an actual argument that ISN'T filled with vague generalities and disconnected sentences. The only "centralized authority" is the mathematics behind it.It's the mathematics that makes it secure, not the "single source".  It just so happens that he's providing the source code, but anyone can write their own client which adheres to mathematics, and have it work on the network. ... AFAIK, it chooses some random connections to connect to from the IRC bootstrapper, but I'm not sure. Yea, I was oversimplifying and taking it to the extremes.  Here's how it would REALLY work:Low value of bitcoins + Difficult target = Pressure to leave the generation businessLow value of bitcoins + easy target = Pressure to enter the generation businessSo, this will equalize at some point.  However, the lower the value of bitcoins, the lower the "equalization point".  The lower the equalization point, the lower investment needed to override the system. (If it settles around 100 computers, you only need 100 cores to start duping legitimate people, potentially in the thousands, of your trades.  Obviously numbers will vary, this was just an example).Thus, transactions fees are introduced to keep this number high enough to make the system reliable.I hope this helps clarify my point. =) Of course they arose out of barter.  Bitcoins were traded for their novelty, and value as a decentralized system.  People thought "Oh hey, this is a cool idea, lets try it out."  "Oh hey, send me 5 bitcoins so I can check it out." etc.  Then, as it became more widespread, merchants began providing goods and services for it.Granted, the evolution of Bitcoins is quite unique compared to other currencies, but I still say misers theorem holds here. Er, by "thought experiment", I meant "proof of concept".  Satoshi seems to be pretty intelligent, and I don't think he was naive enough to think he would come up with the final specifications for the algorithm in the first go.  In ANY project, there's always new things that crop up, and a well designed system is not one that accounts for every possibility, it's one that can adapt and change cleanly. ... wat? I don't think that's how public keys work.  You can't arbitrarily choose a public key, it has to be generated in a very specific way, paired in a very specific way with a very carefully chosen private key. Fiat of the code.  It's the code that's king, not any central ruling body.  Satoshi wrote the code, and published it (not just the compiled mysterious binaries, but the entire code base, which several people have successfully compiled), so you're more than welcome to read said code and understand the rules.  Also, it's unreasonable to assume that satoshi has more than half the nodes, consider a) someone had 1000 cores running at some point, meaning satoshi would have had to have 1001 at least.  Not to mention all the people here who have nodes, and all the lurkers.This post sounds like the ramblings of a paranoid nut-job, and reads like many conversations I've had with people under the influence of drugs ("The man", "The authority" etc.).  If you are seriously concerned, I appologize for making the comparison, but you're more than welcome to verify the behavior of the network yourself. *shrug* Who says he isn't some rich snob willing to waste money? =P Or he might have been using Amazon Cloud services (Or microsofts, or IBM's for that matter).Or, his employer might give him a bunch of virtual machines to work/experiment with (thus, 1000 cores isn't that big of a claim, considering you can have a bunch of low-quality cores). He claims he isn't using his employers resources, but *shrug*. Thereby is the issue.So, if all we're looking for is a single connection, why overcomplicate it?  Why not just keep the IRC bootstrapping? Anyone know when the next block that difficulty will be reevaluated at will be? is pool.ntp.org run from a central authority, or is it somehow a distributed network?  I'm not sure how you'd maintain that list of "stable" IP's without some central authority that lists them. Keep it coming, the jackpot's only growing. =)The cool thing about this system is it can continue in perpetuity.  Since 19% of the coins are kept in the jackpot to convince people to keep playing.
Kiba: Indeed.  *Cracks whip* There's some douche who's got 1000 cores crunching through hashes, so all of us are kind of left out to dry for now. =P Ichi: Probably pretty fast, I saw a huge increase in performance to the tweaked version.  No tellin until you try it though. It doesn't require a server.  You can just start the bitcoin client, and javascript can interface with it from JSON, AFAIK. >_> It kind of defeats the purpose.  What advantage would it offer over building such functionality directly into the client (such as with the RPC and JSON interfaces)? Oli: One alternative is to start the CUDA part hashing with a nonce of MAXINT and subtract one, and the host client start at one and go upwards.  Then, either one could find a hash and you're not repeating work. No.  Go to http://www.random.org/integers/?mode=advancedThe random NUMBER generated BY the seed is between 1 and 100.  The seed is just kind of a "password" to make sure you always get the same random number.Seed -> SHA256 -> hash I posted above.  VRandom.org  VAnswer you're trying to guess Yup, that way I can reveal the seed at a later point, so you can see the winning number.  You'll also be able to verify that I didn't change the seed, because of the hash I posted above.  BUT, you can't cheat and find the result beforehand. ^.^ Woops, sorry, was just trying to defend a fellow bitcoiner.  And sure thing on the clarification.  It's a huge issue faced by any distributed system like this, ESPECIALLY if you're dealing with money/something of value. Red: Noone said it was.  I mentioned uniquely identifying them by the hash of the first block they were produced in (granted that would be "unique" to 50 of them, but some kind of seed, or offset, or whatever would also work) and someone said that in general, uniquely identifying them would be a good idea. Hm, never noticed it here.  But yea, a splash screen wouldn't be too bad an idea for those people who are experiencing that issue. Red: It would still be a breaking change.  While it DOES provide versioning, clients only deal with others of the same version.  They don't automatically stop working or somehow learn to adapt to the new version when they see a client of another version.  Because of this, the old clients would continue on as usual, advancing the block chain.  The new clients, (0.4 for simplicity) would start rejecting the old (0.3.2).  Thus, you'd have a "0.4" blockchain, and a "0.3.2" blockchain that were exactly the same up until 0.4 was released, at which point they would diverge.  Transactions would only occur between clients of the same version, and when people finally switched over to 0.4, this new block wouldn't have the transactions from 0.3.2.  It can be done if absolutely necessary, and we'll just have to warn people that old transactions will be invalid, despite showing up as valid on the old clients.  Thus, we should avoid a breaking-change at all costs.If, however, the sheet referenced the block chain instead, this information would be "extra", and thus safely ignored by older clients.  The block chain would still be valid when generated on older clients.Another route to go would be to implement it this way, and then add it to the "todo list" for our first breaking change.  We then keep a list of things that would be breaking that we want to do until it gets sufficiently large/advantageous to risk the bifurcating block chain, and do it all in one version update.  This would still be a breaking change, but it would allow us to mitigate the negative effects. :-S I always see the screen as SOON as I start it, and THEN it does all the disk i/o, connecting, etc stuff. It's not a completely connected network in the sense that every client isn't connected to every other client.  If by completely connected you mean there's x degrees of separation between everyone, then yes, that's how it is.  Data gets "spread" throughout the network as time goes on, not instantaneously (though it is pretty fast).This was mostly a thought experiment for satoshi, as I understand it.  If the userbase continues to grow substantially, then obviously a great amount of work will go into optimizing and revising the algorithm to support more advanced and intelligent distribution. The unsalted hash of the seed for the solution (as per random.org) is given. *nods* It wouldn't be a reliable way to operate the underlying system, as coins are split and merged in blocks, 50 are generated at once, etc, but it'd be a nice way to provide a bit of verification and safety to the balance sheets. *shrug* I can hash it a second time, but it's not going to increase or decrease security.  I typed out a random alphanumeric seed anywhere between 1 and 64 characters long, so they'd have to bruteforce an ungodly number of options.  Hashing it a second time won't change that. Well, I'm running a "fake" one right now.  http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=534.0Also, the chance of them brute forcing a 64 digit alphanumeric seed which I hashed with SHA-256 is very low.  This is a test run to show everyone how it works, and illustrate the benefit over a regular lotto.This is not a real lottery.  No money required to play.  Please play so that I can judge how things would have gone.Here's how it works:1) I've chosen a random seed to be entered here:http://www.random.org/integers/?mode=advancedunder the "pregenerated seed".  It's between 1 and 100 (inclusive).The SHA-256 hash of the seed is: 627c22822c1dee884411b8f3a09b8545616bcf9837f080a6df26704f604b6d0d2) You pay 1 "fakecoin" to enter, and PM me your guess.  1 guess per fakecoin.  I add this to the pot.If you guessed correctly, you get 80% of the "fakecoins", 1% will go to me, and 19% will go into the next pot.  Otherwise, I post your guess on the "Failed guess" section and update the jackpot.Current Jackpot: 34 fakecoinsChances to win: 1/71Failed Items:123571113141719223341445055667788919293949596979899100 Nice idea!  I love bump!
You'd make more than one dollar because of the transaction fees.  That's the whole point.  If it got to that point, then everyone would stop generating blocks, as it would be unprofitable, and the system would collapse. eureka: No, the balance sheet is very lightweight and only stores balance, not actual coin ownership.  Though, that would be one way to solve that, is to store all 21,000,000 coins (identified by the hash of the block they were generated in) under the address they're "owned" by.  It'd be bigger than the chain is now, but it'd still be significantly smaller than the entirety of the block chain. We're located in Florida, currently at a residential address with a business class data connection and 2 dedicated hosts that are always on.  Once our customer base is large enough to warrant it, we'll invest in a T-1 line or better.All we require is a single written/signed letter that says you're not planning on doing anything illegal, and we're not responsible for anything you do or host.  Doesn't even have to be written by you, just someone who's willing to take responsibility if you DO do something illegal (host childporn or something crazy like that).Also, we'll provide proxy domain names, or you can register domain names with us (we'll just go to another service, but we'll get it under our own name to maintain your anonymity).One thing I mentioned to noagendamarket in a PM was that we're working towards being a Green hosting company.  We're keeping our carbon footprint as low as possible.  Once we have an established user-base (and thus can afford to run a promotion like this), one thing we've considered doing is measuring our carbon footprint regularly, and giving all our users a discounted price proportional to our carbon footprint.  This will incentivize US to keep our impact on the environment as minimal as possible. =) This is a very good solution.  I was looking around on random.org, but I hadn't thought it all the way through.  Would you be interested in buying into a lottery like this?  It's interesting, because it doesn't reward buying a bunch of guesses at once (each one gives diminishing returns, because you're putting more money into the pot) and the longer it goes on (maybe capped to a week, and whoever's closest after a week wins) the more profitable it would be, because there'd be less choices, thus more chances for winning.  It's almost like a Bingo lottery. =P Wow, that tweaked one... I'm getting stunning rates.  I have a quad core Intel laptop.I have two different number sets, 1 while operating as usual, with other programs running, and one while everything but bitcoin (including explorer.exe) is shut down.Stock:         x64 v1          x64 v2           x64 v2 Tweaked        Standard Usage:500-12001000-1800750-15002200-2700Optimized Usage:1500-18002000-25001500-20002700-3400O_O gavin: The balance sheets are meant for more lightweight things.  If you run in "balance sheet only" mode, it allows you to get a quick glance at it, and operate with people you trust.  You trade at your own risk while in this mode.  If you're distrustful, make sure you're checking the whole block chain.  The balance sheets AUGMENT, not REPLACE the core functionality. I was thinking of writing a REAL android client, not just an interface.  One that's actually crunching hashes for you. That gets me thinking... the client should be written so that it can "offload" some of the hash work.  Meaning, accepting possible solutions over the RPC.  So, every time it gets another transaction or starts a new block, it broadcasts it to anyone listening, then whoever's listening can crunch numbers and submit possible solutions.  The only difference being that when the "person listening" is crunching numbers, it's doing so under the original server's identity, so the original server receives the coin, instead of some new client.  This would make running it as a cluster a bit easier, as well as things like "let your phone crunch hashes too!" etc. Perhaps.  If it was a whole-nother "layer" on top of the existing algorithm, it'd definitely work.  And, you wouldn't have to worry as MUCH about the security of each balance sheet, because it's more of a shortcut anyway.  Anyone really worried can always fall back on the block chain.  Likewise, if someone every once in a while double checks the sheets vs the block chain, they can start "blacklisting" them, letting everyone know they're bad.  Or something. Yes, generating a block right now includes a "proxy transaction", which pulls bitcoins out of thin air.  In time, this will pull coins out of the other transactions instead to incentivize continued block generation. How would I do this though?  The whole idea is that instead of a bunch of people guessing, then the numbers picked, a bunch of people pick and the first one to guess the number wins.  Otherwise it becomes a regular lottery, and the point is to be a bit different, so as not to tread on the other lottery's feet.  I was considering starting something like a "real time lotto", but wanted to probe the community first.How would everyone here feel about a lotto that works as following:I, or some third party, would choose a random number and keep it a secret, and put several bitcoins into the pot to get things going.People begin to guess numbers at 1btc each guess.  Each bitcoin goes into the pot.This continues until someone guesses the number, at which point 3 things happen:80% (or some other number, it's up to how people react) of the pot goes to the winner.1% goes to me (very modest, I should say)19% stays in the pot to get it started for the next one, and a random number is chosen again.This could be automated, as a (potentially) very fast paced lottery.So:  What numbers should I use above, or are the values I've chosen reasonable?Would you prefer the "already guessed" numbers be shown?  Hidden?  Shown after they've been guessed multiple times?Any other ideas/suggestions? So you're starting a new lotto, with new tickets?  Or just continuing on until a number gets drawn, with people keeping their numbers? But it'd still continue to grow after the 21 million coins. Depending on CPU usage and such, between 5 and 15 dollars a month. Hehe, I already offered my hosting. =)  (We've only got one customer so far, and they're pleased with there service, so no official business license until we can get a stronger customer base). I don't see 680 on that list, does that mean the lotto will continue into next week? I've got 140 bitcoins... Can you hold one until I generate another block or two? (or win a lottery tonight!) Well, a single person can have multiple addresses, so you don't neccesarily know if two transactions go to the same person, as different addresses could be either the same person or different people. knightmb: Blocks continue to get generated even after all the coins have been "minted".  Also, each block varies in size based on how many transactions occur in that span of time, so yours would only be a rough estimate. I like this idea, though I can't figure out how to work it in without making it a breaking change... It could be incorporated pretty easily as a breaking change, but breaking changes are difficult in a distributed system... The "new" software would look like a vagrant and be pretty much inoperable (it would see everyone else as "hackers") until over half the people updated.  Until then, everyone else would see the newer software as a "hacker", and both groups would reject eachother's blocks, resulting in a bifurcation of the block chain.  Then, old->old transactions would be lost. to the "newer" split blockchain.
Fix'd. Noone knows the identities of who the coins belong to, but they do know that they belong to "some entity".  The first transaction in each block says "Ok everyone, listen up:  Someone from address asd;lkfjads;lfkjasd;lfjkasd;fj owns 50 new bitcoins, even though it didn't come from anyone else."  This doesn't reveal the persons identity, but it DOES reveal when they were created.  Looking back to see when the bitcoins were released to the public, and when the first coin was generated, we can see if the developers left coin generation on for a long time to develop a monopoly. No, they couldn't have, not without us knowing.  The block record shows the creation and time stamp of every coin.  They couldn't have started it for 4 years, and then release it, as it would show up in the block chain as having started 4 years ago.  If they tried to fake it to get themselves more coins, every other client would have rejected it.  The source code is open source, so we can verify that there's nothing shifty going on with the verifying of coins (if(developer) accept(); else verify(); or something) Better yet, why not make Idle-RPG the bootstrapper! haha Ah, didn't know that.  Good thing I don't need to pay taxes yet. ^.^ It's not a recognized currency, and thus must not be marked as income.  However, once you trade from bitcoins to USD, you must declare it as income. F1RSTTT!!!~!`1`1`In other words, Count me in. Ichi: I got 2 blocks in a row back when I was running 1200khash.  I'm up to 2500 now, as per the update, so we'll see if I get some more blocks. =) =P Now get to work on an android version. =P Yup, until the last bitcoin user stops using the service, or some other "shutdown condition", the file will continue to grow as new blocks are generated roughly ever 10 minutes.  If we were to stop generating blocks at some point, we would stop being able to perform transactions.(Granted, I'm not 100% sure that this is where the blocks are stored, but I'm assuming it is.) =P I'm quite aware of local-maxima phenomenon.  I was simply defending the current system as not "arbitrarily difficult".  Each aspect of the solution has a purpose.  Whether said solution is the best was not what I was debating.  If you've got an alternative, feel free to share. As of right now, if blkindex is where the blocks are stored, then the file will grow infinitely large over infinite time. I reacted poorly to what I deemed to be an arrogant attitude.  If that was not your intention, I apologize for being so quick to bristle.  Arrogance (even just perceived arrogance) is not something I deal well with. >_>As for securely transferring a number, this is done with efficiency.  However, in order to guard against duplicate announcements, desynchronized clocks, verifiable history, and specifically malicious users (which, in any computer system, you must assume there will be no end to the malicious attacks), you have to have a stronger framework than simply "transferring a number securely and announcing it." If speed is the issue (Oy, I'm stuck in limerick mode and almost rhymed here >.<), just lower the k/hashes.  Focus on even 10 hashes a second, and get the game viral.  Wouldn't make MUCH money off of it, but it'd be some, which you could augment with in game micropayments.  The key is that you're making (some) money off BOTH your userbases: free and paying.On a semi-related note, the bitcoin generation thing would also work for a desktop game, and probably more effectively.  Develop an awesome game that people can play, and in the background run k/hashing.  Then, give the game out for free.  People love a free/super cheap game (Portal, Plants vs Zombies, Alien Swarm), the problem is making said games profitable.Make the game an iPhone/android/PC title, and you've got hundreds of thousands of people generating bitcoins for your bank account, and the bitcoin network just became that much more impervious to people like nenalod or whatever his name is. Fun or competition,dumb or erudition,the nature of rhymewhile we're passing the timeis a worthwhile admission. Sweat and employment aside,For a while, this thread I have eyed,For all the good meant,I still quietly lamentfor Limericks so pitiful I cried.(Also, I know I'm probably not following the "official" limerick metering, but ah well.) Due to the 8 places of divisibility, there will actually be a last "coin generating" block (someone else figured it out).  However, there WILL be transaction fees to further incentivize block generation. It was just as arbitrary for the people who would follow gold rushes.  Some would strike a huge vein, others would spend months without finding so much as a gold flake.  Granted, this could be increased by putting more effort into it, or cooperating and splitting the dividends.  Which you can do in bitcoin.This quote in particular demonstrates you're not aware of the reasoning behind satoshi's choices.Take some time to learn how mathematics and security works, get rid of the Holier-than-thou, "I'm just here for shits and giggles" attitude, then come back. Probably not very many, but even .1k/hash on a decently popular game, with the userbase of facebook, would be quite a bit. How much do you actually understand about the system, Some Mouse?  Calling it a "giant rube goldberg machine" demonstrates a very poor understanding of the mathematics and verification that the system uses.  It's not just some "arbitrary crunching of numbers".  As for the 10 minutes vs 1 minute, lowering said limit exponentially increases the ease by which someone can invalidate the system.  Satoshi simply chose 10 minutes to strike a balance between unreasonable transaction confirmation times and unreasonable instability and spoof-ability.
That's exactly where the bitcoins come from.  Solving a block "verifies" transactions, making the community as a whole confident in the system.  Thus, you are awarded 50 bitcoins in exchange for, effectively, the "confidence" you just "sold". Franzl: >_> I abhor PHP, so I can't help you there, but some day (Completely overwhelmed with projects right now, but some day...) we might write the .net library. Yes.  Bitcoin. Gold was desired due to it's luster.  In this instance, it was a good in a barter economy.  Money for getting a taxpayer to leave you alone is exactly that: used to exchange for the "service" of the taxpayer going away.The only other instance I can think of where people would want money surely for the sake of having money would be confederate dollars, because they assosciate themselves with the south (a weird form of patriotism or something)... And even most of THOSE people I've talked to are convinced that "the confederate dollars comin back, and when it does, i'll be ready."  Hence, they value it because they have confidence that one day they'll be able to trade said money in for something else of value. *shrug* Money is just a placeholder for goods.  Swapping money for goods/services is done on the premise that you'll later be able to swap said money for your own goods/services.  Money in itself never has any value.I could pick up a seashell, and as long as you have confidence that you'll be able to trade that seashell to someone else for something of equal value to what you trade me, regardless of if it's a single microgram of gold or a jetplane, then that seashell is money.  It's backed by confidence.Therefore, money is nothing BUT twiddling numbers (and paper/coins, in a more archaic sense) in mysterious ways. davidonpda: Not only that, but have the javascript running low level bitcoin generation and sending the bitcoins to you... Then, you're getting money from the people who pay, AND the people who play for free. 2016.  Other than that, yea. I was just thinking about an MMORPG (I know it was mentioned elsewhere, but I was further elaborating on it in my mind) based around a bitcoin-like economy (not connected to the actual economy, so as not to screw with things).  It would take some of the load off the server, allowing people to transfer coins peer to peer.  The coin generation could just be incorporated into your next loot or quest reward or something. Right, but changing it NOW, regardless of if we use it would still require the users to upgrade ("breaking" change, as it's called), because now the numbers would be stored with arbitrary-precision data format, instead of "regular long" format.  Granted, now's the time to do it if we are, while the community is relatively small, but it'd still be considered breaking. Anyone want to buy puns for bitcoins?1 bitcoin for a high quality, sure-to-make-you-groan pun, hand crafted specifically for you.2 bitcoins for a limerick.5 bitcoins will get you a pun or limerick crafted specifically around a topic or person of your hearts desire.If I can't do it within 24 hours, I'll refund your bitcoins!For the next 8 hours my static IP will be 65.9.208.150, just send me your chosen price, a refund address, and optionally a topic for your pun/limerick.  If the IP will not go through, send me a private message on the forum and I'll craft an address for you to send them to. Obviously I wouldn't request money until services had been rendered. =P  Also, I've got my plateful with 4 other projects, so it's low on the priority list, but if no ones stepped up before then, I'll take a crack at it. Ah ok.Proposed revision:  Once you open up the question to the public, they vote on the prediction, as well on a 1 to 10 scale of subjectivity.  This is then averaged, and determines the "percentage split" between how the funds are split up majority/minority somehow.  So an extremely subjective question, the judges aren't penalized for their answer as much, because it could have gone either way. Babylon: Not true.  The software stores them in the base bitcoin value.  All transactions are done with this value stored on disk.  However, the client could display "10 nanocoins" when really it means ".00000001 bitcoins".  It's up to the client to do the conversion behind that.However, to provide additional levels of divisibility, you'd need a structure for arbitrary position.  This would most likely be a breaking change, but it would just mean that everyone needs to update the client.  The old bitcoins could still be converted to the new value system, as long as the new clients still "understood" how the old clients dealt with things. What would the judges do?   I'm not sure I understand the concepts at play here, but if you give me detailed specifications on what it should do, I could probably code it for you ( for a small bitcoin fee, of course =) ). I'm willing to help with any bitcoin related websites for super duper cheap ( paid in bitcoins of course =) ) to help stimulate the economy. Haha, Babylon:  That's very easy to judge, but different people will come up with different answers, and still consider it an "easy" choice. =P ^.^ Bit out of order there. That will cause ANYONE to be able to invalidate the currency, depending on the extent to which the merchant does insufficient checking.  It'd the the equivalent of me drawing a crude approximation of the dollar bill with crayon, and the cashier being so lazy he/she doesn't notice. =P First thought:  "Bum Bot" invokes the completely wrong image for what your site is. =P bdonlan:  Actually, I was trying to figure out how to do that very thing, put a coin in "first come first serve" mode, for transfer onto a flash drive or something.  Can you post more detailed information on how You'd go about doing that?
Minor note:  Demand isn't 15-20 billion.  There's never been a request to IANA that met it's predefined guidelines that got denied, and there's still a couple subnets left.  We've got a bit to grow to still hit the hard limit of IPv4.  Still, your point is valid, just felt like throwing that out there.  A) That functionality hasn't been programmed yet and is only speculative (it's called a Merkle hash tree)B) That would be used for some smaller actions like checking balance and such.  Verifying the entire block chain (which happens when connecting to a network after a long period of time, or when first downloading the block chain, would still catch inconsistencies AFAIK.C) I took "Simplified Payment Verification Clients" to mean that the client does nothing but verify, (aka, not generating), thus saving huge amounts of CPU. satoshi: How many other developers do you have working with you?Martin (another forum member and I) were talking about writing a .Net compatible library for integrating bitcoins into other programs. =P Still, kind of humorous.Also, it occurs to me, Whole Foods seems like the kind of company which would get really excited about the whole concept of Bitcoins.  I wonder what they would say if someone approached them about being the first major retailer to support bitcoins?  Right, I thought we were talking about a private key that was the same type as the client (and assuming the client uses some known standard).  Obviously it wouldn't work if you were to provide an unrecognized type. =PHowever, changing the client to recognize multiple types of PKA's WOULD most likely be a breaking change, unless satoshi is including some kind of version information about what keys were used in the block chain. Not quite accurate.  It relies on the number of BLOCKS generated, which is a collection of all transactions made in a rough timespan.  So, if only one person out of all bitcoin users transfers money in 10 minutes, or every bitcoin user spends bitcoins like mad for 1000000 transactions in 10 minutes, only one block has elapsed in either case.  Then, each block is "buried" under the blocks after it, resulting in more and more security for said transaction.The transfer requires the private key of both parties.  Thus, it's impossible to "create" faulty transactions.  Also, transmitting directly by IP still alerts the rest of the network.  You can't initiate ANY transaction without either a) propagating said transaction throughout the entire network of nodes, or b) creating an isolated graph, where you control ALL the nodes, and aren't connected to anyone else.  As soon as an outside client connects to your "bad island", he starts downloading your block chain.  He can easily verify each step in that block chain, tracing the validity of coin transfers.  He can't "transfer" coins out of thin air, nor can he transfer coins away from an unwilling party, as he doesn't have their private key.  The merchant in your example, running the "simplified payment verification", would need to download the block chain, and thus would see that it was invalid. Heh, my mom works at Whole Foods, and they have a sign that says "We Accept ALL forms of payment."... I wonder how well it'd go over to try paying in bitcoins.   Not necessarily.  The key is used to sign the coins, and right now it's generated by the program.  The REST of the program, however, doesn't care where that key comes from.  I could write a custom client which accepted keys from the user, even if noone else did this, as it would just look like the program happened to generate that key for me.  It would count as a new user, with a balance of 0 (aka, you couldn't "reprogram" your wallet to accept a different key, you'd have to make a new wallet, and send the coins from the old wallet to the new, so that they were signed by your "external" key. Can you somehow indicate how many times each has been picked? Doh.  I assumed this was like the previous lottery I saw, and didn't read the whole post. ^.^ I'd like to buy lot 314, 271, 161, 141, and 020.  PM me an address to send the 5 bitcoins to?(If anyone's curious, those numbers are the first 3 digits of Pi, e, phi, sqrt(2), and i^i, 5 of the most famous transcendental numbers.) No no, we don't take the money from the scammer/honest businessman.  We can't. One possibility, though, is to implement a secondary client where specific coins are marked as "dirty money" on a secondary DHT.  Anyone running this client would be notified when they've recieved "marked" money.  If they know who it is they're dealing with, they know he's the scammer and can report it to the community... or something.( Disclaimer:  Completely freeballing ideas off the top of my head here  ) The system relies on being able to trace the history of a coin to make sure it's not bifurcating in it's history.  The anonymity comes in the fact that there's no identity attached to your purchases, not in the fact that you can't correlate purchases together.  Theoretically, there's systems in place to help obfuscate such connections between income and purchases, but I believe it'd still be possible to trace the history of coins through "some entity".  Likewise, there'd be no way for him to transfer said coins into another wallet without a transaction, which is, effectively, public record.Think of it as people know that a transaction happened between two addresses, but they don't know who those people are or what the purchase was for.  At least, this is my understanding of the system. BitDollar, perhaps, when "contracting" the monetary unit (1000 -> 1)?  BitCent or BitPenny if expanding it (1 -> 1000)? Well, no, it's not changing the backing value of the bitcoin.  If 1000 bitcoins is worth 1000 dollars at said point, and there's a public announcement that now, every 1000 bitcoins is equivalent to 1 bitcoin, then each bitcoin would be worth 1000 dollars.  The only issue is making sure the message/notification is high-profile enough so that all the major exchanges re-price themselves accordingly.  Making a new unit solve the same problem with less confusion, but they're essentially the same thing.  As for distinguishing between "old" and "new" bitcoins, the coins are timestamped, so that wouldn't be too difficult.  The advantage of the "new unit" system, I guess, is that it eliminates confusion among the users.As for the arbitrary precision data structure:  Having thought about it some more, I guess it wouldn't be too difficult, too inefficient, etc.  However, to me it seems like an ugly/hacky solution, and just gripes my "sense of the world" a bit.  Hahahaha clever.  I'd donate 1 bitcoin, but that would make my balance an uneven number >_> Floating point and double precision have precision issues.  Which is something that you do NOT want to deal with in money.  If you were, for example, to have 1.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 bitcoins in a floating point, the actual stored value would be either 1, or 0.00000000000000000000001 (can't remember which off the top of my head).Building a data-structure to hold arbitrary precision would be cumbersome and space inefficient. (There'd be a lot of overhead to talk about how big the number is, as well as the data about the number.  Similar to how strings/vectors work).It could be done, and isn't very difficult, but it'd be a breaking change to the protocol, and increase the packet size for ALL transactions, not just very small/very large. (Because you'd still have that overhead for "regular sized" numbers).Also, I realize my original post didn't address the technical feasibility, but was tangentially related.  It wasn't so much a "here's an answer to your question", more so a "Oh, hey, that reminds me..." I was thinking about this the other day.  IMO, if we ever get to such low levels of transactions for a long period of time, a "split" could occur, whereby we say "Alright, everyone who was operating with .0001 bitcoins, that now acts as 1 bitcoin, and you have another 8 decimal places after that to divide up".  It wouldn't change the value of the bitcoin, it's simply a "relabeling" for sanity's sake.  Likewise, if the economy improved after that, a relabeling the other way could occur, saying "Alright, 1000 bitcoins is now 1 bitcoin".Not sure how this would be implemented in a decentralized fashion (some globally agreed upon threshold, I would assume).  I haven't put too much thought into it, just an idea I had while walking to work the other day. When a transaction occurs, it's broadcast and distributed across the entire network, and everyone is supposed to add it to their block.  If the client who made the transaction sees that it isn't in the next solved block, it rebroadcasts the transaction to everyone, so it makes it into the next block.  From what I've heard, it's pretty relentless about this:  It'll keep trying, forever, until it makes it into the block chain.  Until it does, it shows up as 0/unconfirmed under status. The network operates on standard DHT node discovery principles.  As of yet, there is no TRUE way to COMPLETELY decentralize the node discovery (without getting stupid like scanning entire subnets for someone listening), as you must know at least one person on the network.  After you connect to that one person, they notify you of other connections, and you connect to them, etc.The client comes with a list of "likely candidates" to be online, but there's still the chance that all of them will be offline at some point.  The IRC server is provided simply as a backup, last-ditch resort for finding ANYONE to connect to.  Try blocking the IRC port to see that it's not strictly necessary.As for the transaction fee:Right now, transaction fees are only used in one instance, when dealing with extremely large amounts of bitcoins in a single transaction.  Even in that case, it's extremely low (something of a fraction of a percent).Later on, when bitcoin generation stops "paying off", people will have less of a reason for solving these blocks (and thus transactions will take more and more time to be confirmed, the target value will become easier and easier, making it more likely that an attacker can violate the system.)  In order to keep the "block generational powerhouses" in business, a small transaction fee will be introduced, to keep their profit margin ever so slightly above the electricity/cooling costs of solving said blocks.(At least, this is my understanding from the PDF.)
