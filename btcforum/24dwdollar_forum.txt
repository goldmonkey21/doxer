Please check the update here https://medium.com/@thegcccoin/updates-on-whats-coming-in-q2-3f5ebbfb0a1d We launched a twitter contest with great rewards , more info here  , cheers! Hey man! Please write to the wallet support regarding your issue I'm sure our team will sort it out asap support@thegcccoin.com , cheers! Hey tvtinh!The solution is we are not another ICO project. GCC existing on it's own chain, have integrated transaction fee sharing inside the wallets. We have hardware wallet called Bitfreezer which is competitor for Trezor and ledger - we have cheaper and safer solution to store coins. GCC It's already accepted as a merchant solution , have web wallets and product called 3D Hub which is related with 3D printing industry. We have offices in two countries with 25+ employees. It's only the short description which we are working on , whitepaper will be released late this month and should clarify our concept , thanks for interests and have a nice one! Changed thanks mate. Dears,Our team is growing fast and we are looking for c++ developers, work on bitcoin fork code we are more than 20 people now , flexible payment you choose if btc paypal or other , nice bonuses paid in GCC. DM me if interested Hey guys!As we see more interests need to clarify some things:1. PoS on this year is max 18% annually - depend by network weight and how many people are minting.2. Transaction fee are distributed for 3 separated wallets which addresses will be publish here - first part of tx fee goes for green projects(we already donate couple of projects which you can check on our website) - community will have their own website to vote for particular nature project which will receive founds.3. Second part of tx fee will go to the community who downloaded the wallet and are registered on the website - we will create kind of GCC knights who help us grow - they will receive tx fee as a reward for their work same like developers. We will update thread because we made a really nice new products and projects which we didn't talk about. Regarding the exchange - we have status pending on one of the top 50 exchanges right now and waiting to be approved. This weeks we will create community iniciatives to be listed on next exchanges as we understand liquidity is more than important to make our project 100% working. Hey ho !We have probably the coolest video about our team in crypto space:) Check it out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_Z7KWeev8U&t=2s Hey mate!What we are building is more than a 3D printing portal so people can earn by doing prints for others who need it - All you can pay in GCC , you can also buy a printers using our currency.

We also make a 3D cafe Franchise business with our coin as a major payment and many airdrops based on LBA and our app which we are finishing. We existing in the market more than 3 years and our coin were launched last year - we just didn't advertise our project like others do without working products, but now we are ready for it.

Same as subject Global CryptoCurrency project is looking for signature campaign manager , please pm me if interested. Hi Man! Just give as a little bit time to proof our concept. We would appreciate constructive feedbacks. Anyway thanks! My suggestion is to check out RIPPLE as this asset is most involved on banks. Greenpeace is huge and is doing well by itself. Small organizations do not, and this is why we want to support them. But this is just the beginning  we will be asking people for their opinions and try to convince them to vote for small, local organizations that are close to the problem and cant punch their way out of a paper bag. This is what we love and give our backup to  decentralization  to help a big number of scattered organizations instead of one big company which is doing great. Here you will find thank you letters from the organizations we have already backed.- Orangutan Foundation International here- Turtle Foundation here- Rewilding Europe here 3D Print Points accepts payments in GCC  and this is just for starters.

GCC also can be used to pay for any other services provided by other business entities. GCC will generally not limit the usage of GCC or the types of business entities that would like to use GCC for their business.Our idea is to build a community behind GCC together that's why we also created a referal program which is called GCC Shop Club to make us expand even faster. Every company that is looking towards the future knows how important cryptocurrencies will be in future transactions. GCC Shopclub is the vehicle to promote themselves as a leading company/business accepting GCC coins as an alternative way to pay for goods and services, and it is also a great source of passive income for everybody who contribute.Stay tuned!You can trade GCC coins here!*** CRYPTOPIA  *** More exchange Coming soon|Visit our website! Hello , I have my btc in trezor since a year or so , do I need to do with them something before 1 of August? Thanks folks do yourself a favour and buy Matchpool GUP token... see the price now and you will see after 3 weeks I won't waste my time with trolls, but I know there were new people who didn't fully understand the risks involved.  I'm sorry about that.  I will make it very explicit if I continue with PayPal.  The whole point of having multiple currency pairs is to allow the market to determine the inherent risk involved with each one.Here are the withdrawing addresses:5806 - Never withdrew (siphoned through trades)5810 - 17tvqFtxmqEk1dHkp1SPZ1xhqVJytgqfQf5184 - 12JuxerBKaZqj1Byyxfi1a5uSPiT3Ueso36038 - 1Ez9Ey6D2ubgroSirbMHx8gGhqeZdjqg31 I may.  I'm getting a lot of requests for it. Where is that in their TOS?  It may exist, but I've never seen it.  Have a link handy?A closed network is much easier to manage.  I can eventually root out the scammers or whoever is inviting them.  Otherwise they just keep making new accounts.When it's all said and done I may re-list it, but I will rewrite the email contracts and make it VERY clear about the risk involved AND that BCM can not be liable for any loss.
I'm getting the impression that PayPal is intentionally trying to shake any connection between itself and Bitcoin.  That is, they WANT to burn people and discredit Bitcoin to new eyeballs. While I don't forbid selling invites, be very careful who you sell them to.  I may ask you for compensation if you invite someone who is a fraud.  Otherwise, you could be banned along with the scammer and anyone else you invite.You could charge a fee for invites and "insure" new members by holding these fees as collateral for any problems.  But, I doubt .01 BTC is enough. I'd like to apologize to anyone who was 'burnt' by the recent events.  Especially to older members who may have struggled to get an invitation.  Open registration was a bad mistake.I've told some inquiries BMBTC/PPUSD will be re-listed once all trades are confirmed and scammers are purged.  This may be true.  If PayPal does not take the proper side on many of these cases I am officially done with them.Bitcoin will flourish with or without PayPal. I'm afraid this is just the beginning. Back in late 2009, I bought 1000 from NewLibertyStandard for about $1.Not long after I formatted my hard drive and didn't bother with them saving them...Yeah I know.  What an idiot.+1000 Sorry, I was abducted by aliens and forced to perform sex acts for the past two months.Or maybe...  I've been busy. This is fixed and you should have the correct amount in your account now. Haha...  I think she's been reading too much Tom Clancy.Unless she's using court rulings on free speech as precedent.Either way she's a Joker. Thanks!Things seem to be running smooth now.  Depending on demand, I will create more processors.  Currently, I can cash/issue checks for USD.  When I find a good ACH provider, I will add bank transfers.  LibertyReserve is also an option and so is Pecunix.  Thanks to noagendamarket, we can also cash/issue checks for Aussie dollars.Escrow type trading is still available for PayPal and MoneyBookers.  You can also choose orders with individuals you trust and/or with good feedback (escrow only). I don't believe this is anything new.  Bankers have been pulling this trick for centuries.  What's more disturbing is NPR writing a story on it.  Is it time to expand the role of the SDR? Anyone on top wants to stay on top.  People with common goals or interests form organizations all the time.  Why wouldn't "staying in power" be a common goal? Maybe there is a bubble, maybe there isn't a bubble.  The best way to prevent a bubble is to use your own judgment and not listen to everyone else. Ron Paul forums is a good place to hit up occasionally.  A lot of people there are gold bugs though, and there ready to pounce. I'm opening it up to real trade.  BMBTC/BMUSD and BMBTC/BMGAU are the currency pairs.  These pairs are automated.  Funding for USD is restricted to LibertyReserve for now.  Funding for GAU is restricted to Pecunix.  Deposits and withdraws for both LibertyReserve and Pecunix are automated.I didn't see any problems with the Stop Orders/Stop Limit Orders.  Both use the last trade price and not a limit price from a Bid/Ask in order to execute.  Maybe the confusion is coming from this?  This prevents some one from opening an order with the sole intent of 'unlocking' all of the Stop Orders//Stop Limit Orders.I'm putting the API on the back burner, but the stream is up and should be running.The following fees apply.  I'll post these on the site.  .5% per trade for all currencies.  1.0% for BTC withdraws, 2.0% for LibertyRerserve withdraws, 2.0% for Pecunix withdraws.I'll be watching everything carefully for any problems.If everything goes well, I'll open it up to escrow trades in a week.  This will include the PayPal type trading people are familiar with on the old site. That's correct.  I'll look at it tonight and see what the problem is. I think what you really want is trust, and trust is something you build over time.  Any audit can be faked, and any auditor corrupted.  You need time to prove you won't disappear and you're accounting is valid.  It's a continuous process that never ends. I'll try to have the stream and API finished by this weekend, plus some fixes. The simple order form is just a start.  I can add a price.  If you have anymore suggestions for it let me know.  What exactly was wrong with the Stop Orders?  Market and Stop Orders might be confusing until the liquidity builds up.  Limits and Stop Limits should behave better. You have to create an order.  Select the 'My Orders' tab and click 'Open New Order'.  Here is an explanation for the currency pairs the new site will use.  The old site's 'PayPalUSD' will become BMBTC/PPUSD on the new site.  Currency pairs are the norm for traditional currency trading and it's drifting that way in the Bitcoin community I think. I will manually register anyone who wants to join, if they send me an email.
Yes, that is the idea.  Walk up the trunk by suspending/banning until the scamming stops.  As Nanotube mentioned, this will be just one tool for using PayPal.  The others will be rating, time, and maybe manual approval.  I understand the frustration of making it too hard to use PayPal.  We'll try to strike a balance. Market orders are tricky.  The limit back orders need to be sufficient enough to insure a fair price.  I think they can get there eventually.  When it goes live, I could disable market orders until the limits start piling up.  I forgot to mention that market orders will be given preference before limits.  With trade bots, this could be advantageous, since they will be functioning at high speeds. The market orders may be functioning correctly now.  However, when matching two market orders, there needs to be at least one previous trade (to determine the price) for any currency pair + processor combo.  This "bootstrap trade" is created from two limit orders or one limit and one market order. Anyone is welcome to join.  Just send me your email address. The times should be working for failed logins now.  I see what you're saying about the market too.  I'll look at that next. Which ID's were they?  I see two market orders but they have different processors.  An order with a 'PayPal', 'LibertyReserve', or 'Pecunix' processor works similar to the traditional BCM market.  They can't be matched with an automated order which has 'BitcoinMarket' as the processor. Yeah, it will have the details eventually.  That's a low priority at the moment. The first line of defense, is an invitation only membership.  Be mindful of who you invite.  If you invite two or three scammers in a week it's not going to be good for your membership.  Secondly, you will have to have a high enough rating and/or special approval for PayPal deposits.  Traders will also be able to use the rating system when making escrow trades for PayPal or any processor for that matter.  If it gets too bad, I'll shut PayPal down for awhile.  The scammers will be back.  But, we can make it difficult for them. It's not open source.  I'd like to make a little profit sometime in the future.   Trying to keep the tabs at a minimum, but those three are pretty important, I might tabify them.  Email me and I'll send an invitation (passwords are sent by email). I envision Satoshi as S.R. Hadden from the movie Contact.Maybe a little less dramatic though.  The new Bitcoin Market is up and it's full of bugs.  I'm not finished adding features, but I'd like to have more eyes looking over it from now on.  If you want to be a tester, contact me by PM, email (bitcoinmarket@gmail.com), or you can find someone who's already invited.  This is just a testing phase, so I will wipe the accounts when it's over (I might do this several times while testing).  You won't be able to fund your account yet, so don't send anything via LibertyReserve, Pecunix, or PayPal!  Your accounts won't reflect it.  However, they will have certain amounts of play money to trade on the market or send to someone.I've chosen to use currency pairs without a processor.  So instead of "BTC/PayPalUSD" there is just "BTC/USD".  This allows USD to be funded through various processors which are currently only LibertyReserve, PayPal, and Mail for USD.  There are pros and cons to each method but I will save that for another post if anyone is curious.  Also, BitcoinMarket is considered to be it's own processor.  To create an automated order, select "BitcoinMarket" as the processor.  To create an escrow order, select the corresponding processor.  There will also be a way to manually accept escrow orders like ExchangeZone (one of the features I still need to add).Ratings are pretty basic.  You may give a score of +1, 0, or -1 and a comment for any escrow trade that is finalized.  Ratings are viewable to everyone, and who rates who, is also viewable to everyone.The site is currently at:  https://184.106.171.80/  Can't wait to see it! Sort of off topic, but is the "time dollars" thing you mentioned the same as this?  Interestingly, Richard Rockefeller has a hand in it.  Richard is the great grandson of the big mac daddy JD. Fantastic!This should be Wikipedia worthy...  Yes?  No? I don't understand why people get so hung up on scaling as if 1 billion people are going to access Bitcoin directly.  Does every Joe Sixpack access the ACH to make a transaction?  No, they use third party banks and online processors.  There's other solutions than one solo uber robust network. A distinction between "hard" and "soft" currencies is an important one.  I already allow sellers the option of a 10-day delay, although it's not enforced.  Regardless, I'm saving all good ideas for the new design.  I'm keeping registration closed so I can focus on this new design.  If it goes on too long, I may hold an open registration day for people who don't have a forum reputation, verifiable ID, or don't know anyone who can vouch for them.  Otherwise, you can email me and I'll set up an account for you.  I'd rather have it open for everyone, but the main concern is to protect those already registered. Sorry, I forgot all about it. Why observe evidence?  That's so 19th century...    Well, I'm trying to keep it clean inside Bitcoin Market so I have to take these draconian measures.  You're welcome there.  As are most people here, who have been around for some time. After today, I see this isn't going to work.  Registration is closed once again.  However, if you have a good reputation in the Bitcoin community, I can make an exception.  I'm thinking a notable presence on this forum or a respectable Bitcoin service is sufficient.Sorry for jerking everyone around, but these scammers have a very profitable enterprise and they're not going to give up so easily.
New members can not buy more than BC500 using PayPal in a week.  New members can sell an unlimited amount using PayPal, and can buy/sell an unlimited amount with LibertyReserve and Pecunix.  I'm not concerned with MoneyBookers, since no one buy/sells with it anyway. First off, some news...I was planning to add more currencies, but that is no longer a priority.  Development on the current version of Bitcoin Market has ended and a new platform is in the works.  Because of this, I'd rather not spend time developing better member verification and a rating system for the current version.So...I'm opening up registration later today.  However, new members must heed the following rules IF they wish to use PayPal.1.)  Immediately after registration, send your username using your PayPal email address.2.)  The email address for trade notifications must always be set to the PayPal email address.3.)  You will not be able to buy more than BC500 per week using PayPal.If I add to or modify this list, it will retroactively apply to all new members from this point in time.  Any new member using PayPal and not following these rules will be immediately banned.If you're already registered, these rules do not apply.EDIT:  THIS NO LONGER APPLIES Thank you.  This has been helpful.  I have banned two more members and confiscated a small amount (BC98). Something as simple as a mailing list might work, but it needs to be somewhat exclusive.  Otherwise it would give the scammers valuable information and defeat its purpose.  It could share critical information such as compromised account numbers/addresses and known aliases.I'm thinking it should be mostly for exchanges, markets, stores, or other entities which sell a large amount of Bitcoins. I sent you a PM. I don't have any record of that one. PayPal accounts which are compromised or claiming to be compromised are:chr...16@in.coma.k...99@gmx.deGio...hi@aol.comI have cancelled all unconfirmed trades associated with them.  Unfortunately, some trades were already confirmed, and the Bitcoins promptly withdrawn.  I am sorry for that.  Some encouragement though... at least two people have received refunds so far.Bitcoin Market will be open tomorrow, but new registration will remain closed. The person receiving the payment will get a notice similar to:"Recently, PayPal received a notification from a user regarding unauthorized access to his PayPal account. As a result, one of the payments credited to your PayPal account has been placed in a temporary hold while we investigate the claim.  PayPal constantly monitors transactions for unauthorized use of accounts in order to maintain the safety of our users." Yes, that is correct, except more than one PayPal account is involved. Bitcoin Market is experiencing a deluge of complaints from sellers.  I *think* I have identified several accounts that may be involved, but there may be more "sleeper cell" accounts.  The trades were primarily from PayPal accounts that appear compromised.  Many trades in the last two days will be bogus.  I will issue refunds when I learn more.  If you have an account locked, I'm pretty sure you're a fraud.  But if you can prove otherwise, I'm willing to listen.  I think time will be the best jury.The market will be closed for the rest of the day.  I'll try to reopen tomorrow, but I'm not taking new registrants until further notice.Other exchanges are reporting similar behavior.  Beware of the sudden spike in the exchange rate. I was wondering if this would cause alarm.As theymos mentioned, I've been moving Bitcoins around the past 24 hours. I betcha some Air Force generals are pissed because they have to divert funds into the new Cyber Command.  They want that money for Raptors and black budget projects.  In their minds, having a "kill switch" is more cost effective than squadrons of computer scientists and technicians. It seems to be "full steam ahead" for proposing Internet regulation.http://www.geek.com/articles/news/former-cia-director-proposes-presidential-kill-switch-for-internet-20100928/ Maybe.  But keep this in mind...We'll probably hear "so and so is about to dump X number of Bitcoins onto the market" over and over and over again.  It's a "short and distort" technique for market manipulation.  The opposite of this is a "pump and dump" which will also circulate, but probably not as often.Since Bitcoin is a thinly traded commodity with no documentation of who owns what, it will be especially vulnerable to this sort of thing. That's assuming institutions will buy treasury notes and bonds or will even have the time to do so.  I imagine a modern day bank run (at a national level) could happen in a matter of hours, possibly in a matter of minutes.  If people can't withdraw their funds on the spot, their confidence in the USD will go from 100% to 0% before the teller is able to finish her apology. I don't follow you.  If you will, please break it down.All of those accounts are "insured" for up to $250,000.  Where will this money come from?  They will have to issue more money or default on their promises. Wouldn't a nationwide bank run result in hyperinflation? Alternative Link.I busted up when I saw this on zerohedge this morning.  It's only a matter of time now.  Bitcoin is the future! I'm not sure yet, but it's back up and functioning now. Offers and Trades are updating every minute now.
Are they a commodity?  I think it depends on what definition you choose to use.http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&defl=en&q=define:commodity&sa=X&ei=lw1nTObrHYG88gaOosCyBA&ved=0CBUQkAE So you have a theory of distribution and need a currency to implement it?  I suppose a Bitcoin-like currency could be modified to behave in this manner.  If I understand correctly, Universal Dividend is like social security or welfare, but for every citizen and built directly into the currency instead of being levied by taxes.  In that regard, I see this as a noble effort.  I'd rather the wealth generated by money creation be spread around instead of benefiting a small elite class (like it is now).There are some problems though...Short of a revolution, you will not get any government to adopt this system.  Like a bunch of drug junkies, governments are now dependent on the central banking system.  You're only hope is to create a private currency.  A modified Bitcoin-like currency could be a solution.The Bitcoin Project is trying to create an electronic gold standard.  Universal Dividend is really at odds with that.  It is experimenting with socialism. The masses will demand paper, regardless of whether we consider it outdated or foolish.  I think it's a good idea to have a redeemable note and/or check if we want Bitcoin to be available to them.  How it should work I don't know. Keep in mind...  We are trying to create a new currency, not a personal money tree for everyone. I'm wondering about the "pair" names.  Is "BCUSD" short for "BC/USD" or BC per USD?  I believe the examples used are reflecting a USD/BC or EUR/BC exchange rate (which is the convention for most exchangers).  In this case, it would be more appropriate to use USDBC or EURBC. So it's official?  We are now popular enough to be recognized that we aren't noteworthy enough. Oh, the irony. That's strange, 0.3.3 worked fine on it.  It's no biggie, I need to upgrade that machine anyway. I'm getting this too on 32-bit Ubuntu 9.10.It works fine on 32-bit and 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04. Maybe you had some listed in an Ask Offer?That gives me an idea.  I should probably have a "BC Available To Withdraw""BC Available To Withdraw" = "Total BC" - "Total BC In Ask Offers" There's no minimum to withdraw funds.  Double check your Bitcoin Address on the Account tab.  If that doesn't work, send an email with your username to bitcoinmarket@gmail.comI'll be able to help better if I know who you are.  I decided to auction off an ad for Bitcoin Market. Thanks marketmaker, that is helpful.  I'm wondering if there are any "magic" dates for which the risk of charge-back drops off significantly.  I've thought about holding all Bitcoins for 10 days, or at least for new sign-ups, until some trade history is established.  Holding them for 90 days is out of the question though. Yeah, I should probably auto cancel offers after a certain period.  With the recent influx the tables are getting fairly large. No charge-backs so far.Has anybody had experience with charge-backs in other affairs?  What were the circumstances?  At what point after the initial transaction did they occur?  24 hrs?  10 days? 30 days?  I'd like to hear about it.  How can I better prevent it?  You can send me a PM or an anonymous email if you want to keep it discreet.I think most donate or gift it.I had done that previously.  The madness behind the different exchange rates (PayPalUSD vs MoneyBookersUSD vs LibertyReserveUSD vs. etc.) is that each processor has it's own associated risks.  In theory, the risk of charge-back is factored into the exchange rate along with many other things. Would Wikipedia have ignored the airplane until it was independently verified an explained by "professionals" who weren't smart enough to invent it in the first place? My ISP blocks 80.  Besides that, I don't have many complaints about them.  Bandwidth hasn't been a limiting factor yet.There are some security issues I have with hosting elsewhere.  I don't want to rush into anything. Maybe he's trying to cause panic selling through rumor and hearsay.  Wouldn't be the first time someone's tried. Probably the son of a [paper] banker.  Or some other powerful interest that will be hurt by a disruptive technology. Yes, it has changed.  That was the self-signed certificate I was using a while back.  The one I use now is verified by StartCom. I've been meaning to post this for some time.  I wanted to clean it up into a simple example, so it would be easy to understand.  I don't know when I'll have a chance now.  So... I'll just go ahead and post it as is.  Maybe it will help somebody.It probably isn't the best approach (after talking to Satoshi a while back).  In fact, I haven't tried applying the new functions in the API, that were added later on and now in Version .3.  But, it is battle tested.  Why fix what isn't broken (yet)?  It runs as a separate process on the machine with the Bitcoin server.  The only thing I left out was a break handler for the while loop.  Anytime you see "list(something_inside)", realize it's a query to the database using SQLObject.When I go through it again, I'll post a revision here.Code:#! /usr/bin/pythonimport jsonrpcimport timeimport datetimefrom database import *class BitcoinInterface(object):    def __init__(self):        self.access = jsonrpc.ServiceProxy("http://127.0.0.1:8332")        return    def issueBitcoinAddresses(self):        localBitcoinAddresses = list(Address.select(AND(Address.q.type_ == "localBitcoin", Address.q.value == None)))    # Get all unassigned local Bitcoin Addresses        for localBitcoinAddress in localBitcoinAddresses:            localBitcoinAddress.value = self.access.getnewaddress()            client = Client.get(localBitcoinAddress.clientID)            print "New Address:\nUsername:  %s\nClientID:  %i\nValue:  %s\n" % (client.username, client.id, localBitcoinAddress.value)        return    def takeDeposits(self):        localBitcoinAddresses = list(Address.select(AND(Address.q.type_ == "localBitcoin", Address.q.value != None)))    # Get all assigned local Bitcoin Addresses        for localBitcoinAddress in localBitcoinAddresses:            amountReceived = self.access.getamountreceived(localBitcoinAddress.value)            if amountReceived > localBitcoinAddress.amountReceived:                client = Client.get(localBitcoinAddress.clientID)                quantity = amountReceived - localBitcoinAddress.amountReceived                client.bitcoins = client.bitcoins + quantity                localBitcoinAddress.amountReceived = amountReceived                transaction = Transaction(clientID = client.id)                transaction.datetime = datetime.datetime.now()                transaction.type_ = "Deposit"                transaction.quantity = quantity    # Transaction quantity is positive for "Deposit"                print "Deposit:\nUsername:  %s\nClientID:  %i\nQuantity:  %f\n" % (client.username, client.id, quantity)        return    def issueWithdrawals(self):        clients = list(Client.select(Client.q.bitcoinsToWithdraw > 0))        for client in clients:            if client.bitcoinsToWithdraw <= client.bitcoins:    # Redundancy check                foreignBitcoinAddress = list(Address.select(AND(Address.q.clientID == client.id, Address.q.type_ == "foreignBitcoin")))[0]                try:                    quantity = client.bitcoinsToWithdraw                    self.access.sendtoaddress(foreignBitcoinAddress.value, quantity)                    client.bitcoins = client.bitcoins - quantity                    transaction = Transaction(clientID = client.id)                    transaction.datetime = datetime.datetime.now()                    transaction.type_ = "Withdrawal"                    transaction.quantity = -quantity    # Transaction quantity is negative for "Withdrawal"                    client.bitcoinsToWithdraw = 0                    print "Withdrawal:\nUsername:  %s\nClientID:  %i\nQuantity:  %f\n" % (client.username, client.id, quantity)                except:                    print "Failed Withdrawal:\nUsername:  %s\nClientID:  %i\nQuantity:  %f\n" % (client.username, client.id, client.bitcoinsToWithdraw)                          else:                print "Failed Withdrawal, Not Enough Bitcoins:\nUsername:  %s\nClientID:  %i\n" % (client.username, client.id)        returnbitcoinInterface = BitcoinInterface()while 1:    bitcoinInterface.issueBitcoinAddresses()    bitcoinInterface.takeDeposits()    bitcoinInterface.issueWithdrawals()    time.sleep(300)
Oh wow, I had no idea I was even ranked!  Thanks for sharing that! There were some offers made in error today.  Whenever this occurs, I try to rectify it as best as I can.  I need to make it a little easier when placing an offer and have some error detection.  Also, I'm working on a better way to generate quotes, so errors can be eliminated quicker.  More work to do.  Also...  Any Bitcoin bank will have to rely heavily on it's reputation.  They might be able to practice fractional reserve banking, if they offer promises for Bitcoins.  BUT, they won't have nannies to print more money for them when they overextend themselves either through fraud or carelessness.  Then it's bye, bye.  I don't see the Bitcoin economy being completely dependent on fractional reserve banking. Yes, I noticed this too.  But it's been busier all day. It's up, but another busy day.  I'm working on it as fast as I can. I really like where you're going with this.  Let's keep this active. I appreciate the offer davidonpda.  Thufir and Teppy have also offered to help.  Thank you guys.For now, I've decided to buy a new machine and continue hosting myself.  There's a lot of security issues I want to work out before I decide on something remote.  I also got a Webfaction account I can use for static content. It wouldn't be a true innovation if it didn't catch a fair amount of boos and hisses. Alright guys and gals, this caught me with my pants down.  Trading may or may not be conducted tomorrow, July 12.  I will try to have something working as quickly as I can.  If you have any questions or concerns, send to bitcoinmarket@gmail.comDonations are greatly appreciated:Bitcoin:  13kndzuZ7XmWh3WboL6nFp7gpYj4poGuJtPayPal:  dustin.dollar@gmail.com I think the bigger problem, as others mentioned, is shadow interests buying/selling to create speculative bubbles and subsequent crashes.  They could orchestrate these events at critical times (during a version release or media event) to discourage new users.  Shadow interests will have enormous funds and won't be concerned with making a profit.Even if they could corner the market, it wouldn't do them any good.  The same goes for buying and destroying.  Both would cause massive deflation and an ever higher price. I'd like to see the last two sentences..."Preliminary analysis indicates that the market value of Bitcoins is already approaching parity with the energy needed to generate them. The developers expect that this will result in a stable-with-respect-to-energy currency outside the reach of any government."Changed to something like this..."Analysis of power usage indicates that the current market value of Bitcoins is at or above the energy needed to generate them.  This suggests a stable community with an increasing demand for usage.  The community is hopeful the currency will remain outside the reach of any government."To represent the community as a whole, it probably won't resemble anything you started with.  As you average in everyone's opinion.  Nothing is stopping the I2P community from adopting it right now.  It'd be great if they did.I'm not a believer of intrinsic value though.  Not even for gold. IMO, The Money Masters is the definitive work detailing the central banker scam.  Don't be fooled by it's age, everything still applies today (even more so).  Anybody who hasn't seen it, should take the time to do so.  It's over 3.5 hours, so you might want to split it up.  Bill Still has recently produced a new film (The Secret of Oz) which he's in the process of promoting.I don't know what Bill Still would think of Bitcoin, but his trust in fiat money controlled by the people, as opposed to a gold standard, would seem to make him a perfect fit.His new website has a small forum. As a society, we aren't taught about currency.  We accept it without question.  Whether that's deliberate or not, I don't know.  But I think a lot of the confusion stems from this fact.  We have to learn what we should have been taught.  It should have been passed down through the generations, like every other science. Yes, I sure did!  I was a little concerned, but everything seems alright so far. I believe the best approach is to have completely independent currencies with completely independent chains.Here are a few reasons...1)  It's easier for developers concerning compatibility issues.2)  It addresses deflationary concerns, by allowing more currencies to come online as demand increases and currency is lost.3)  It compartmentalizes.  A weakness or exploit in one currency doesn't necessarily affect other currencies.4)  It allows people to pick between competing currencies and choose the winners. It will be easier once .3 is released.  You won't have to compile from source in order to use the API.  If you know any Python or want to learn some I can help get you started.  Send me a PM here or email me at bitcoinmarket@gmail.com and we can set up a time. I'm connected now. I'm banned. That is an interesting idea.  But, how would the wealth be transfered to a new system and what would be the exchange rate?  Perhaps this could be combined with an insurance plan that had a predetermined and guaranteed payout written in the policy?
I think there may always be a "die hard" group of users who will back the currency.  These people will step in and buy at certain prices they feel comfortable with.  It will be similar to investment banks and funds supporting "beat down" stocks.  Only, no one will be around to bail them out if they choose poorly.  There's always a chance the situation could be remedied or corrected and this will encourage bottom speculation.    I think something would have to be seriously flawed for a sudden and permanent collapse to zero.One should realize this sort of catastrophic collapse could happen to any stock, commodity, or currency.  Modern economic theory has led us to believe there are risk free zones where one can place wealth.  Politicians and Central Banksters propagate this lie through bailouts and currency manipulation. Welcome to the forum Bitcoiner!  That is an excellent rebuttal.  I couldn't agree more.  Maybe Suggester likes playing devil's advocate?  I don't know. I think the default theme in 10.04 makes everything look ugly.  And why are mini/maxi/close on the left side and not the right?  That's really annoying. I didn't try that, but I did try two servers on the same machine.  One on 127.0.0.1:8332 and the other on 127.0.0.1:8080.  Neither browser script could make a request to the opposite server.  I was using Firefox 3.6 There are some new functions in the API that Satoshi has added.  listreceivedbylabel() is what you want to be using now.  This lets you keep track of usernames with the option of generating new addresses or reusing old ones. I think the exchange rate is the best indicator for Bitcoin's trustworthiness.Many will come.  From everyday users to crypto experts.  The real test is if they transfer from their physical wallet to their digital wallet and how much they choose to transfer.  Or if they offer goods and services for Bitcoins and at what prices relative to traditional currencies.  This test is better than any opinion or analysis. Yeah, my ISP blocks port 80.  I had a landing page on GoDaddy, but took it down a while back.The Historical chart is suppose to be in Open-High-Low-Close format.  But, if the price doesn't move, it ends up looking like a dash.  I've never been able to get the scaling right either (which doesn't help).  Eventually, I want to abandon matplotlib and use a JQuery plug-in.  Some interactive charts might be fun to use! Awesome!  I'll check it out. Although you need a unique BA for each user, you don't necessarily need to regenerate a new BA for every user's transaction.  You can issue a single BA for each user and then keep tallies (in your database) on the amount received from this ongoing BA.This sounds like it would work.You could...1. Issue a new BA to ALL users and set a tally value to 0 for each user's BA.2. Email these BA's to your users.2. Poll these BA's from the daemon every 10 minutes.3. If the amount received from a BA is greater then the tally value then count the difference as a new deposit and increment the tally.Or something similar to that.  This could be done in a separate process too. It sounds like getting it fully automated might be easier on you.  Bitcoin is fully capable of that, but I don't know how easy it will be for your situation.  Is Python good for you?  Where is the user's information normally stored? If you're generating a new Bitcoin Address for each transaction, people may accidentally send to old ones.  They will have that BA in their Transaction history and may think it's good for multiple uses.  Just something to think about.The possibility of accidentally sending to a random BA is insanely small though. Looks good to me. Right now, Bitcoin Addresses are the only option if you want automation.  If you're only taking donations, or only handling manual transactions, IP Addresses might be better suited.  That way they can send you comments or messages about their account info. Maybe when you get up to speed, you can be a spokesmen or something.  Trying to explain this to the people on Ron Paul Forums gives me a terrible headache. Welcome Derrick!  Watch out everyone...  He's another one of those crazy Paulites! : P Have you seen this? Yes, partial orders are filled, if the whole amount is not available.Charge-backs are a weakness of this system.  I've thought about ways to help rectify this weakness.  I've come up with two so far...1)  A user rating system, based on past trades and/or time.2)  Forcing the buyer to keep Bitcoins in his/her account for a period of time as collateral.I haven't seen a fool-proof exchange method yet.  Some would argue that LR can't be trusted or a centralized account is begging to be confiscated.  Who knows...  But I do know designing something that fits the needs of a large audience is hard work, especially when our community is still so small.  PayPal is fairly common to all. I'm trying something new...From now on cash will be sent directly from the Bitcoin buyer to the Bitcoin seller using PayPal.    When a trade is conducted on the market, an email is sent to the buyer instructing him/her to send money to the seller.  When the seller confirms they've received payment, the Bitcoins are released to the buyer.  (I hold the Bitcoins).  If a trade "goes bad", I will refund the Bitcoins to the seller.  Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals are automated.  You can find more info on the site.This is experimental.  It's going to have some bugs, so please bear with me. A "General Questions and Comments" section might be good also. I might start a page on that FX.  It's not too bad with Python.  You can join the IRC channel on Freenode at #bitcoin-dev if you have a question.
This is what I'm thinking.  It's possible that multiple Bitcoin versions will coexist with each other.  As older versions deflate, new ones will spawn.  People will freely move in and out of each currency.  Nobody will be forced to adopt a newer standard version.  A certain percentage will elect to adopt it and leave the older version.  This will inflate the older currency and allow more coins per person.  The whole thing will naturally balance itself. Not sure about FreeBSD, but payments can be automated with the new version.  http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=63.0 This would be very helpful.  I hope someone can host it. D***, haha...  Well... at least I got sirius-m to share some of his mojo.    I'll check it out. Here is code for a simple Python API.  Each method connects to the server, sends a request, gets a response, then returns a Python dictionary equivalent of the JSON.  It uses standard Python modules.  No error checking is done and only three functions from rpc.cpp are implemented.  If there's interest I can write more.To use it, the Python code should be something like...access =  BitcoinAPI()access.getInfo()access.getAmountReceived("1JyEmxiMso2RsFVfBcCa616npBvGgxiBX")access.sendToAddress("1JyEmxiMso2RsFVfBcCa616npBvGgxiBX", 100.00)    # Send 100 Bitcoins to my Address  This will be the base for automatic transactions on my site.  If there are any questions or concerns let me know.  If there is something severely wrong, feel free to school me.Code:import httplib, simplejsonclass BitcoinAPI(object):    def __init__(self, host = "127.0.0.1", port = 8332, timeout = 3):        self.host = host        self.port = port        self.timeout = timeout        self.httpHeader = {"Content-type": "application/json"}    # I don't know what needs to be in the header, but this works        return    def connect(self):        self.connection = httplib.HTTPConnection(self.host, self.port, timeout = self.timeout)        return    def disconnect(self):        self.connection.close()        return    # Functions return a python dictionary which should be equivalent to the JSON syntax received from the server    # ident or "id" is a constant 1, but can be overridden when calling.  E.g. getAmountReceived(address, ident = 23)    def getInfo(self, ident = 1):        self.connect()        params = simplejson.dumps({"method": "getinfo", "params": [], "id": ident})        self.connection.request("POST", "/", params, self.httpHeader)        response = self.connection.getresponse()        #print response.status, response.reason    # Use for troubleshooting        dictionary = simplejson.loads(response.read())        self.disconnect()        return dictionary    def getAmountReceived(self, address, ident = 1):        self.connect()        params = simplejson.dumps({"method": "getamountreceived", "params": [address], "id": ident})        self.connection.request("POST", "/", params, self.httpHeader)        response = self.connection.getresponse()        #print response.status, response.reason    # Use for troubleshooting        dictionary = simplejson.loads(response.read())        self.disconnect()        return dictionary    def sendToAddress(self, address, amount, ident = 1):        self.connect()        params = simplejson.dumps({"method": "sendtoaddress", "params": [address, amount], "id": ident})        self.connection.request("POST", "/", params, self.httpHeader)        response = self.connection.getresponse()        #print response.status, response.reason    # Use for troubleshooting        dictionary = simplejson.loads(response.read())        self.disconnect()        return dictionary I am wondering if someone could make a graph of the current Bitcoins in circulation and the projected limit that will eventually occur.  It might help new people understand the inflation that is occurring.  Does something like this already exists? Oh yeah?  Is that you?    I know this is well below your starting bid, but since no one has taken it yet I'll offer $20. The more people introduced the better, but I think those outside the mainstream will be most attracted to Bitcoin.  They will be the early adopters that establish it's credibility.  A celebrity like Jesse Ventura would be helpful.  He is outside the mainstream.I've thought about buying advertisements on some of these alternative talk radio sites like Alex Jones, Jeff Rense, etc... Looks like your site is down. I'm not sure what Paypal is required to report on individuals and/or merchants.  This explains some of it for US domestic.  It's a little dated though.  Maybe someone could elaborate. Here is an idea I have been pondering.  I think it's similar to Satoshi's, only transfers are made directly...  Feel free to rip apart or amend.  I created a goofy .pdf to explain what is happening.In theory this could be used for any third party such as Paypal, etc.  I think it would be very difficult for them to prove that individuals are participating in a currency exchange.  And, I think it becomes more difficult to prove as the number of traders increase.One big problem.  Person A and Person B must follow through with their transfers and be honest about their actions.  A solution might be to require an initial deposit from each individual to be held as collateral before any orders are made.  These deposits could be in Bitcoins and offered as compensation when a trade "goes bad" for whatever reason.Pros:1.)  No centralized account that can be seized or frozen.2.)  No tax reporting burden on accounts.Cons:1.)  Transfers are less anonymous since individuals can "see" one another.2.)  Parties must be trustworthy. Excellent.  It seems like many of the Austrian School are stuck on gold as the only "true" currency.  While that may be true in the physical world, it will never be able to compete with fiat systems in the digital world.  There needs to be an alternative.  I hope many of them come to understand that currencies like Bitcoin don't want to replace gold, but to augment it in the digital world. Oh I see it now, thanks. Hi everyone.  I'd like to see a good discussion on different methods for transferring into and out of cash.  It has been touched on elsewhere, but I'd like to create a definitive thread for it.  This discussion should include, but shouldn't be limited to the following...1.)  Methods mentioned previously on the forum, along with their pros and cons.2.)  New ideas including ones that are "outside of the box"3.)  As a customer, which method do you prefer?  What is more important to you?  Anonymity, security, convenience or other?NewLibertyStandard is using direct transactions with Paypal.I think Sirius-m is working on several different direct transactions that the customer may select from.I am using a deposit and withdraw system using Paypal (for the time being).Let's dicuss everything from satoshi's sophisticated "e-bay-like" idea, to madhatter2's "money in the mail" idea, and everything in between.One last thing.  Legality can be listed as a pro/con but let's not get wrapped up in it here.  NewLibertyStandard already has a good thread started on that topic. I sent you the Bitcoins and a PM, but I'm not sure if you got the PM.  Nothing is showing up in my outbox.  Is anyone else having this problem? Sure, I'll play and lose some.  There are a ton of Python options for web frameworks.  I'm in the process of learning CherryPy, and I'm new to web development, so it's slow going.  Looks like they have an example for basic uploading.  Something in PHP would probably be best for the community though.  Are there any Python people here? Sorry for the address changes.  I should have forewarned everyone. Yes that's correct.  I don't think it would be too difficult to add multiple orders, but that might be awhile.  There's a lot of other things I need to automate first.
There are 9 people signed up but only 3 have made a deposit so far.  Myself makes 4.  Looks like we had our first real trade around noon! https://98.168.172.185/https://www.bitcoinmarket.comI just changed it.  I assumed that my ISP blocked port 443 along with 80, but evidently they do not.  The domain name is now pointing directly to my IP Address. Yep, that's correct. I've decided its time to try some real trading.  I think it will be more exciting for everybody (myself included).  If you're interested there is more info on the site.  You can deposit either Dollars or Bitcoins or both.  This isn't a donation!  It's the real thing, but I want to keep it on a small scale for now.I'm using Paypal for the cash handling, until I find something better.  I kept all the accounts from the last update so some of you won't have to re-register.  I also created an account and placed a bid for 500 Bitcoins @ $.0067/BC which I think is NewLibertyStandard's current exchange rate.I enabled SSL but it's a self-signed certificate right now (you'll get notifications that will try to scare you away).If you have any questions you can post them here or send them to bitcoinmarket@gmail.comhttps://98.168.172.185/ www.bitcoinmarket.com I think I've found the problem with the frequent market crashes.  It will be another day or two before I have an update to fix it.The server was down today due to an unrelated hardware problem.  It is back up at http://98.168.172.185:8080/ and I updated the redirect at http://www.bitcoinmarket.com/Stay positive people! I'm not trying to create value out of nothing or facilitate a Ponzi scheme.  Just a market for buyers and sellers and a way to track demand versus the US Dollar.  Every buyer may have a different reason for buying and every seller may have a different reason for selling.  Resupplying a production cycle is just one reason of many.  The exchangers are not going to create trust in bitcoin all by themselves, but they are a critical piece that must be in place. That would be true if an infinite amount could be generated at any one time.  It is the scarcity created by finite production which drives value above production cost. I don't think their value is arbitrary.  Just really really small.  A medium of exchange or currency needs to have a "stable value" or at least a value that can exist within a certain range for an extended period of time.  This builds trust.  When there are multiple exchanges trading Bitcoins and each exchange is tracking a similiar exchange rate it will build trust.  Eventually it will reach a critical mass. Unless there is a way to determine demand, no one will be using them as a currency.  Even now, every Bitcoin has a value.  The key is finding it and tracking it.  I want this to be a real market where buyers and sellers determine the value based on their demand.  It will match buyers and sellers (it can already do that) accordingly.  I will only be a broker.  I don't think we should be worried about what the value is.  Our main concern should be accurately determining that value as it fluctuates.  If it's 100,000BC/$1, 1000BC/$1, or even 1,000,000BC/$1 then whatever...  The fact we are worrying about people dumping Bitcoins suggests we haven't determined an accurate value yet. Finally an update!  The graph I added should auto update at around 5pm CST today.  The last three days on it are just an example.  Anybody can register and do some mock trading.  You can use the above IP address or redirect from my GoDaddy host at http://www.bitcoinmarket.com/ Sorry, I can rant at times.  I am mostly a libertarian, so anything I say is going to be biased.  I see free exchange as a fundamental right similar to speech, arms, or privacy.  Any of those can be used for evil too.  Ultimately, it's about freedom of choice. It's the "Non-Criminals" who are the biggest criminals of all.  These kind of people are SO powerful they can write the law and put themselves above it.  A free monetary system would be a massive thorn right in the bottom of their a**. The economic model is sound in principle, but what happens when people start to notice?  The Empire isn't going to tolerate this kind of behaviour.  There is too much at stake.  The fiat currencies are hanging by a thread and there's no reason to believe that's going to change any time soon.  At best, they'll discredit Bitcoin with endless propaganda.  At worst, they'll hunt us down as "criminals" and "terrorists". Thank you.  I will fix the username/password issue in the next update.  I do have SSL set up but it's disabled at the moment.  Right now I'm thinking about doing this for profit, either by commission or a withdraw fee of some sort.  If it ever gets to the point where I'm tired of working on it I will definitely share the code with the community. Site is back up at http://98.168.168.27:8080/ Editing and cancelling orders will be options at some point soon.  I will expand on past trades as well.  I'd like to have a daily graph on the front page eventually.  I'm not sure what you mean by "market depth" though? Yes definitely.  Since that's a major issue I'm going to bring the website down for a couple of days until it's fixed.  I am changing the database over to MySQL anyway and will be deleting the old one. I encourage anyone to make more than one account.  Place buy and limit orders at various prices for each of your accounts and check to see if confirmed trades are accurate. Thank you.  Any and all help is appreciated, along with suggestions.  That's why I've decided to share it with everyone at this early stage.I'm using Python with CherryPy.  I'm really working on two separate beasts.  The website itself and the market program.  I need to work on the market program first, but in order for everyone to help me test things, I need at least a basic site set-up. I want to create a "real life" market for Bitcoins.  People will be able to exchange dollars with me, but I'd rather it be in less frequent larger amounts.
