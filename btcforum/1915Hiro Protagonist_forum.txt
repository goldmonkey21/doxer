Hey, thanks for heads up on uc_bitcoin. I didn't find it in my initial search but found it by name. Thanks! Hey Mike,Thanks for the library. I was looking to roll a module for Ubercart to accept Bitcoin this weekend, and you saved me a lot of work. Any updates on your library? Or are there any other modules in the works already to do this? Any status on the FreeBSD port?Thanks for this HOWTO. Any ideas on the best way to run bitcoind as a daemon on the system?
