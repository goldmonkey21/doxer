Wn.comPlaybuzz.comtheodysseyonline.com...etcTELEGRAM : @Longlive_SAI A lot of effort goes into achieving a successful ICO and part of this process is coming up with a professional ICO whitepaper. This simple document conveys a complete picture of your project and should convince your target audience including capturing the interest of the unprepared. Therefore, it is pertinent you source for a professional assistant to complete your whitepaper prior to launching an ICO. A professional white paper should include the following MAJOR sections in order to clearly lay out the objective of the ICO project as well as people behind it.ProblemStart writing your ICO whitepaper by identifying the pain pushing you to take action. Under this section, identify the problem you are trying to solve as well as people affected by the problem. More so, how does the pain affect them and how many people are affected. A professional ICO whitepaper writer should identify such features in order to place the project in context.Solution and product descriptionPrior to jumping into this section identify the why context of your project. This will help in bringing forth the solution which should be well detailed in this section as the product description. In simple terms illustrate how the product will relieve the pain discussed in the first section. Bring in the breath of fresh air which shows the project vision of making the world a better place after achieving your goal.Also in this section discuss the market opportunity and business model as well as marketing and strategy employed in the project. Such section will add business plan appeal to the white paper essential to improving the feasibility of the project.Token commercialisation and economicsAlso known as cryptoeconomics communicate to your audience on whether the sale of tokens is capped or uncapped. Communicate in clear terms how the funds raised will be used and show accountability of every dollar raised to woo investors to your side. Demonstrate mechanisms available to incentivise or encourage token use. Finally, illustrate what will happens to unused tokens from the ICO will they be burned, sold or recycled.Team membersTeam members encompass an important element of ICO whitepaper usually detailing the project team biographies. It is possible for investors to get on board even with a not very convincing idea just because the angel investors will believe abilities of the team remember Android was once a camera operating system! Therefore, include the team qualification as well as past successes and its a plus if they have experience in the blockchain domain.Legal requirements and guidelinesICO regulation and compliance is increasingly becoming a thorny issue for project developers and investors as well. Therefore, create a legal framework and guidelines that delaminates legal issues such as general information relating rights (on dividends and interests) conscious of the country of operation securities law. All this is important to satisfy proper disclosure requirements and show commitment to regulatory scrutiny. Other information to include under this section includes knowledge required; risks associated with the token acquisition, governing law and arbitration, warranties and representations and important disclaimer clauses.RoadmapInclude a detailed plan ideally 12 to 18 months showing the development roadmap. For instance, listing on exchange and launching of the beta version should at least be included in this section as the minimum sub-sections.Take away!In addition to above salient features of an excellent ICO whitepaper I will give a couple of take away! realised as important in my career in copywriting especially for ICO whitepaper. Always include a kick-ass executive summary as its convenient for busy people such as investors. Always include the problem and solution while keeping it simple and succinct. Ideally executive summary should not go beyond 1 page without any fancy features such as charts or graphics.Maintain a balance between the use of technical terms and simple language to reach a higher number of target audiences. Focus on satisfying criteria such as:Does my white paper answer at least 90 percent of readers questions e.g. problem, solution?Can the reader trust your team as professionals on the issue being tackled?Use callouts and white spaces- these are important to capture the attention of skimmers. Therefore, let those in a hurry get the gist of your project in the very first few seconds. Therefore, make great use of such elements to capture the interest of most readers.You can reach out for a word or two about services such as ICO whitepaper via below contacts.Skype: live:sahajrooney100Telegram: Longlive_SAIHappy reading & ICO Launching! @Longlive_SAI Currently Community manager at idap.io  hello Kindly pin me message on telegram @tradealex98

Budbo will be the first-of-its-kind, fully integrated blockchain based solution that serves as the backbone for cannabis legalization, medical research, and the cannabis ecosystem as a whole.With 100,000 users quickly growing to 1 million users on the Budbo app, combined with over 2,000 dispensaries in our network, this wealth of information is publicly available to those who purchase the BUDBO Token, and becomes the foundation for the entire industry for credibility and authenticity of product.As the MARIJUANA ecosystem develops and expands, the value of the token is bound to increase.🥇 BUBO tokens will list on HITBTC at $1 (min) but their current offer price is $0.30. {Short Term } - 3x Return🥈 The Budbo app has been downloaded by over 75,000 users on the Android app alone. With the wave of legalization sweeping across nations, this number is sure to go up by 10 times. I predict that the value of their token will rise to $3 within the coming 3 months. {Mid Term} - 10x Return🥉Hemp coin (THC) and Pot coin (POT) have broken into the top 200 cryptocurrencies of all time. Valued at over 100 million each, these companies provide a prelude to whats in store for the next marijuana superstar - Budbo token (BUBO).

There are a total of 100 Million CLOUT tokens, which have already been generated. 1/10th of the total CLOUT tokens will be sold during the ICO. CLOUT plans for longevity by scheduling the periodic release of CLOUT tokens over time. 1 Million CLOUT tokens will be released every year for the next 5 years following the ICO. https://youtu.be/5c1frn6SziI Thanks dude for sharing your info.  Clout network is built with two native tokens, the CLOUT token (ERC223) and it's daughter token CLC. Furthermore, members will be subsequently rewarded with CLC for their interactions with the CLOUT Network proportional to the type of interaction. The CLOUT network hosts a variety of news and articles about the blockchain in addition to articles covering crypto investments, as well as a detailed & current analysis of all upcoming ICOs.

Note that the pre sale bonuses are paid out of this (6,000,000 SCT) fund.https://soma.co/ With a total of 6,200,000,000 PAX, the team has decided to provide 64.5% only for sale in Token sale phase,mostly to inject liquidity into the network and to allow to as many people as possible to participate and benefit from the token low initial value.In short, the team has decided to keep 1,000,000,000 PAX as a reserved fund, which we later used for daily operation and also will be used to reward token holders.

Thats an out of the box thought process! "moderators do not remove likely scams"And that is what is exactly wrong.  That is why this forum is a cesspool of crap.  Scams, get rich quick schemes, and basically nothing else.-AndrewBuck
Doing a bit of poking around the forum for comparison purposes was kind of interesting.  While I was browsing to look up examples for my last post I thought I would have a quick look back at some of the old posts, and I encourage others to do the same.  If you click to the last page of threads you will see a bunch from back in 2011.  Almost without exception they are people offering real services for sale in bitcoins.  Programming, web hostings, vps offerings, offers to teach people things, minecraft hosting, etc.  Now compare that to the current front page of this subforum and you won't find any of that.-AndrewBuck The way you reduce scams is to delete the threads that are scams.  This thread right here... https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1798996.0 is a scam.  It outlines a nonsense business proposition, it was called out by the very first poster in the thread, it was created by a user with no posts, it is a scam; and yet there it is, visible in this forum, just waiting for someone to be suckered by it.  Now I am citing that thread as a particular example, but it is far from the only one.  When you leave scam threads available and just cover your eyes and say "it is up to the people reading not to get scammed", no... that is not enough.  If you know people are using your platform to scam people and you don't try to stop it, then other scammers come in and you ruin the platform.The current policy seems to be, "well, we will just let people comment in the thread saying it is a scam to warn people".  The problem with that is every post doing that just brings the scammer back to the top of the forum and puts them right in front of more gullible people who ignore the warnings in the thread and get scammed.-AndrewBuckEdit:  Here is another example:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1670537.0   This is clearly someone who is running some kind of scam.  Now the scam is not that they are not paying the people, they probably are paying the 15 cents per person that signs up... this is not the scam.  The scam is that they are filling some fake site with fake profiles somewhere so they can scam other people somehow.  Not sure what they are doing exactly, but its pretty hard to imagine an altruistic reason to populate a site with fake profiles.  And here is the thing: this forum is complicit in that.  Whatever money they steal from subscribers to that site, or from investors who think the site is popular, or whatever they are doing, this forum played its part in helping them do that.  Why do you want to be a part of that?  Why do you want to enable that? That is what I think is the problem though, the idea that because scams happen and people fall for them then we should just let them post here and search for new rubes.  And furthermore that there is not even a sticky post with rules like "Straight up ponzi schemes are not allowed".  There are rules that could be enforced that would cut out a lot of the more obvious kind of nonsense.  Rules like "posts asking people to make fraudulent statements like signing up accounts under a false name will be banned".  It is a simple rule and easy enough to enforce.  It doesn't necessarily take just the moderators to enforce this, rather the whole community should be in favor of stamping out this kind of stuff.  We are all here because we support bitcoin, why are we letting its reputation be tarnished by this kind of crap.-AndrewBuck As another example, there is a thread where someone is trying to find someone else to get their adsense account verified because they don't have enough traffic to their own site to meet google's criteria for activation.  This is outright fraud just on its face, and could be blocked on those grounds, but furthermore it is not too hard to imagine that once they do get their account verified they will be using it for nefarious purposes.-AndrewBuck @NeuroticFish I guess this makes sense, and thank you for the reasoned response.  Like I said in my original post, I guess I am just ranting and somewhat frustrated.  I came back to the forum after a long time away and it just saddens me to see how this forum is used now, compared to how it used to be.  I understand moderating is a thankless job, even to just deal with true spam (like viagra posts and whatnot that I am sure they are flooded with), but that is why I am kind of surprised to see things like captcha solving being allowed on the forum.  Why are we making it easy for people to create spam that our own moderators (and everyone elses) has to clean up?  Why are there not rules about this kind of thing?-AndrewBuck I am sad to see how this forum has devolved.  It used to be a place for people offering actual services - programming, web development, consulting, legal services.  Now that is gone almost entirely and what little there is gets buried in a flood of "get rich quick" schemes.  I am glad to here the sig campaigns have been cleaned up a bit, and my focus is not on them specifically, they are just one example that came to mind.  What bothers me more are the other things I laid out in my email like captcha cracking, or paying people to sign up under referral links in MLM schemes, etc.  These things are possibly illegal, definitely against the terms of use of the sites they attack, and just general asshattery.Do we want this forum, and bitcoin in general, to be known to the world as the reason every blog post everywhere gets flooded with spam because any spammer can buy 2 dollars worth of some BS altcoin, make a post here, and get 10,000 captchas cracked so they can spray their fake viagra posts all over the internet?-AndrewBuck I am not saying the sig campaigns are scams themselves, but it is hard to find more than a handful of posts here that are not "make money doing nothing" kinds of things.  The fact that we have hundreds of those going on leads to just a flood of posts that have almost no value to the forum, just so people can up their post count on their campaign.-AndrewBuck I would like to put out a call to others to see if there is interest in cleaning up this subforum.  There is a lot of scammy, and potentially illegal, services being offered here and very little response from the moderators or the community to call this out.  I am really surprised there are not rules about what kinds of things can be posted and that stuff that is obvious scams continue to be offered with no reprisal.Partly I am just ranting and venting my frustration, but it saddens me to see how this forum has devolved over time.  Years ago, this was a place for people to find honest work and be paid in bitcoins.  Can we maybe have a bit more of that and less of the "best new signature campaign - earn $$$$" kind of nonsense?-AndrewBuck Is there a different subforum for offering services people pay for?  This one seems to all be "easy money" scammy stuff.  Would be nice to have a place for people posting offers of real work, rather than scammy captcha crap.  Honestly I am surprised captcha solving jobs are even allowed here, as the only purpose of them is to enable spamming/scamming of sites exactly like this one. Looking through this subforum it is kind of sad to see how it has devolved since I was here years ago.  Almost nothing here besides signature campaigns, captcha solvers, and obvious scams.  Kind of surprised there are no rules about posting such nonsense and that it gets so much attention. I should point out that I would be happy to do small test samples of my work if people were interested in seeing how the service would work.  Just post a message here indicating where you want mapped (and what kinds of things to map) and I will spend a few minutes mapping free of charge so you can see the quality of the work.-AndrewBuck Sorry to bump an ancient thread but I thought this would be the best place to post this so people can see the previous successful transactions for context.I am interested in offering this service again; i.e. you tell me what you want mapped and either make an offer for payment or I can quote you a price for what you want done.  Obviously the prices quoted above do not reflect the current market value for bitcoins so they will seem very high by todays standards but my rates will be quite reasonable.The quality of the my mapping is some of the best available in the community as I have years of experience and have traced nearly a half-million buildings from satellite imagery, as well as tens of thousands of miles of roads, waterways, powerlines, and even underground pipelines.  I can map anything you want mapped as long as it is visible in the imagery (roads, buildings, waterways, landuse, trees, whatever).Looking forward to hearing from interested clients.  The bitcoin world is a lot bigger now than it was back in 2013 so it will be interesting to see if there is more interest in this.-AndrewBuck Hey Stick, great website.  I do a lot of OpenStreetMap editing and was glad to see someone marry the idea of OSM and bitcoin together.  I think your map has inspired a lot of people to tag objects in the DB when they accept bitcoin.I filed a github issue about the edit link you have on the site, as well as having permalinks.  The issue is here...https://github.com/prusnak/coinmap/issues/1Also, it would be nice to have the 'slider bar' style zoom buttons rather than just the +/- buttons as it is impossible to zoom out more than one notch at a time which is kind of annoying, I hate how openlayers defaults to that.Finally, I see you update every 15 minutes, and was just curious what you setup looks like, do you keep a full planet up to date, or do you just do an overpass query or xapi query every 15 minutes?-AndrewBuck Sounds like an interesting development for the bitcoin economy.  Being able to buy cars in BTC is a big step forward.There is a map based on OpenStreetMap located at www.coinmap.org which shows bitcoin accepting businesses.  If you give me details on where the dealership is I can put it on the map for you.  I also offer a separate service of improving the map around the business for a small fee paid in bitcoins, but I will put it on the map for you for free whether you choose to take advantage of my other services or not.  I think there is already a car dealership in Kansas on there, but I don't know if they sell cars in BTC or just do repairs or what.Anyway good luck with the car sales, hope it goes well for you, and I am glad to see the bitcoin world growing to accept more sophisticated things like this.-AndrewBuck Just posting a quick note here to say that I have done a bit more mapping in the area linked above and am happy to do more.  The user tjohej who asked me to map there asked me to map that town as there is a bar on the north side there that accepts payment in bitcoin.There is a site http://coinmap.org/ which shows the places which accept bitcoin on a nice draggable map (using openstreetmap as the basemap).  The coinmap site currently is showing 46 businesses which accept BTC but there are probably a lot more to add.  If people want to add more places to the map they can do so themselves, by editing openstreetmap directly (there is a link on the coinmap site, you just create a username and then start editing like you would a wiki), or you can add a 'note' on openstreetmap if you don't want to bother with editing yourself.  http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/NotesThe mapping I did around the bitcoin accepting bar was done for the purposes of putting the bar in 'context' of its surroundings.  My fee for mapping that town to the level seen on the map was 2 dollars, to give you a sense of what you will get for your money (1 dollar for the buildings in the main cluster, and another dollar for cleaning up the roads and doing all the surrounding buildings).  If people have a business of their own they want shown on the map, or want more mapping done around one of the already listed bitcoin accepting places, just let me know.  Of course I can do any other kind of mapping as well, anything I can see in the satellite imagery I can put on the map (roads, buildings, parks, etc).  If you know a business that accepts BTC I will help you put it on the map for free, as this is pretty easy to do, I will only charge for more detailed mapping like tracing buildings, etc.Hopefully there will be some interest in this offer as I think it is good for both bitcoin and OpenStreetMap.  Both are projects that are worthy of support.-AndrewBuck One of the common difficulties people have is in understanding bitcoin is the role that block creation plays on the network and the notion of what a "coin" really is.  I think for people who are not crypto geeks like many here on the forums, a much better description of this process could be given by making an analogy to deeds for things like houses.  If you think this is a good way of explaining the bitcoin network you are free to use the analogy below any way you want (even copy pasting it), if you would like you can make a donation to the address in my signature.  Here is how it would work...---------------Suppose Alice builds a house in a city somewhere.  After this is done she will own the newly built house and to prove she owns it she can point to a deed at city hall that looks something like this: (New House, Alice).  The two entries on the deed are the (seller, buyer) of the house and represent signatures at the bottom of the deed.  In this case there is no seller since it was a newly built house so Alice just signs as the buyer accepting ownership of her newly built property.  Now suppose that at some time later Alice decides to sell the house to Bob.  He gives her $100,000 and they go down to city hall to have a new deed drawn up an filed in the vault: the new deed looks like this (Alice, Bob).  Since there is now a deed on file that shows Bob as the last person in the chain of owners going back to when the house was built, Bob can now say he owns the house because he, and he alone, has the authority to sign a new deed that looks like (Bob, someone) at any point in the future.Now suppose that people wanted to start using houses as a currency.  Houses are much too valuable to be traded for ordinary day to day purchases so some way of making "change" must be provided.  To do this what city hall could do would be to offer the following service: instead of issuing deeds only for the whole property, they would also allow sellers to sell just some portion of their property.  Returning to the house Bob owns, suppose he wants to use some of it to buy a $10,000 car from Eve and Eve is willing to accept 10% of Bob's $100,000 house as payment.  Bob and Eve go down to city hall and have a new deed drawn up that looks like this (Bob, Eve 10%).  This means that there is now not just a single chain of (seller, buyer) deeds going back to the original buyer, but a chain that has a "fork" in it.  For this particular house, Eve is the owner of 10% of it since she could decide to have a new deed drawn up transferring all or part of her 10% stake in the house, and Bob owns the other 90% and can have deeds drawn up whenever he wants transferring all or part of that for things he wants.  City hall simply keeps filing the new deeds in the vault and also checks every time it allows a new one to be drawn up that the seller really owns the portion of the house they are selling.  The way they do this is by simply following the chain backwards starting at the last deed that the seller has on file and making sure it can be traced all the way back to the original builder of the house.  If such an unbroken chain of deeds exists than the seller can transfer that share and they let the new deed be drawn up and filed, otherwise they refuse to put it in the vault with the other deeds.This chain of ownership may get quite long and even fairly complicated with small chunks of the house being broken off and transfered to other people and then later on some of those pieces may be recombined to make larger chunks (for example a car dealership selling lots of cars in exchange for 10% chunks of the house).  At any given time there may be hundreds of owners each owning a bit of the house but if you add up the shares of all those people at any point in time they will always add up to exactly 100% of the house.This process is exactly analogous to the way that the ownership of bitcoins works.  New coins are created out of thin air by "miners" which are computers that repeatedly solve a math problem needed to make the bitcoin network secure.  This devotion of computing resources to running the network is analogous to Alice building the house originally.  The problem that they are solving is basically doing the work that city hall was doing in the above example: they are checking that newly created deeds are valid by tracing them back to the original miner that created them and then storing the valid deeds in a vault every ten minutes.  Just like in the example above, ownership of the bitcoins can be transferred from Alice to Bob by adding another deed on the end of the chain of deeds with Alice as the seller and Bob as the buyer.  Furthermore, they don't have to transfer their entire stake in bitcoins, but are allowed to transfer portions of it down to very small amounts (0.00000001 of a bitcoin is the smallest "piece" of a bitcoin that the system will allow you to trade).The reward of 50 new bitcoins being created for each block solution found by a miner will eventually be cut in half to 25 per solution.  It will continue to be cut in half every so often until the total number of bitcoins in existence adds up to exactly 21 million.  This is like the city above running out of land to build new houses; ownership of existing houses could and would still be traded there just won't be any deeds for new houses showing up, only deeds for transfers parts of already existing houses being passed from person to person.  After the supply of new coins dries up the reward for mining will dry up as well.  As this happens the network will gradually transition to a system of transaction fees set by people willing to make a transfer of bitcoins (i.e. to have a new deed drawn up, verified, and locked in the vault).  The sender of bitcoins will specify who they want them sent to, plus some other amount they choose to be given to whoever finds the block solution that allows the deed to be sealed up making the transfer final.  Since the sender of the coins sets the fee themselves (and they can set it to 0 or any small amount they wanted to) the miners will compete to claim these fees.  Some miners will work only on trying to very quickly find solutions for transfers with large fees in them, while other miners may choose to harvest the many other small or 0 transaction fee transfers and try to make money that way.  By this process a market price for different service classes will evolve, people willing to pay higher fees will get expedited service, while people paying little or no fee will still get through but will have to wait longer for their transfers to become finalized.  People not wanting to pay fees but still do transfers quickly would be able to set up their own mining computers (something anyone anywhere can do) and try to find solutions for block that contain their transactions, effectively doing the job of city hall themselves.Because the supply of bitcoins is finite, divisible, and easily transferable they satisfy the criteria to be used as a currency, just like the houses above could be used as a currency.  The bitcoin network is not theoretical, it is up and running now and has been processing dozens of transactions per hour for some time now.  If you want to start running the mining software that supports the system (like building new houses) or start trading things to other people for some of their bitcoins (like Bob buying Eve's car) you are free to do so at any time and since the system is open, you will be able to continue trading them as long as you are willing to, even if that means running the network yourself. I think it would be good to have a discussion regarding the rules surrounding how bid/ask orders are placed and the rules used to fill them.  By trading rules I mean things like: minimum size orders for placing orders, minimum tick size in terms of price per bitcoin, etc.  It would also be nice to establish what the various rules are for each exchange and how they resolve issues like what price does an order settle at if the matching bid/ask offer being used to settle it are for different amounts.  I think a good way to start this discussion, as well as to improve the overall confidence in the exchanges themselves, would to put together a standard list of "questions" about how the exchange works.  Each exchange owner can then answer the questions and post their responses somewhere on their exchange.  This will allow users of the markets to make better choices about which market would best fulfill their needs, as well as increasing their confidence in the safety and stability of the markets themselves by letting them know the exact rules by which that particular market is governed.Note that I do not intend for this to be a discussion about what rules any particular market should abide by, this is intended to be solely about what kinds rules the market should have have a stated position on.  To give an example of what I mean, one rule is regarding the minimum tick size for pricing.  I do not want this to be a thread about whether there should or should not be a minimum tick size on any or all of the markets, but rather, is this a rule that a market should have a stated position on: even if that position is that for their market there will be no minimum tick size.Hopefully after a bit of discussion we can come up with a good list that each market will then be able to respond to on their market's rules or help pages.  To get us started I have tried to compile a good list of questions that the more established markets tend to have rules about (NYSE, NASDAQ, LSE, etc).  There are probably many other questions that the various markets should have a stated position on.  If you come up with other questions you would like to see added to the list post them below and I will try to include them in the main list so it is easy for the exchange operators to respond to.-Buck-  Is there a minimum size for bid/ask offers to the market?  If there is, is the minimum size determined by the number of BTC or the other currency involved in the offer?-  Is there a maximum size for bid/ask offers, and if so what currencies form the basis for the limit?-  Is there a maximum outstanding position limit? For example, regardless of whether there are limits on the size of an individual offers, is there a maximum number of bitcoins that can be put up for sale (or for bid) by a single trader at one time?-  Are there daily per trader volume limits?  For example, can a single trader sell 1 million BTC in one trading day, or are they limited to some maximum volume per day?  Is this volume a separate limit on buying/selling or is it a limit on the sum total of the trading activity?-  Is there a minimum price tick?  By this I mean, what is the finest precision that is allowed for the rate of bitcoins to other currency; i.e. if there are standing orders at $1/BTC can a new offer be placed at $1.000000001/BTC?-  Are all currently outstanding bid/ask offers shown?  If some are not made public, what criteria is used to determine which offers are public and which are hidden?  For example, do the publicly available data feeds include very very low/high offers, or are only the first so many in each direction shown?-  If some offers are not shown on the public boards, who (if anybody) has access to the full list of offers?-  Are there any fees for entering bid/ask offers, or are there trading fees assessed on successful trades?-  Are there fees on deposits/withdrawal of bitcoins or other currencies?-  Is there a daily limit on deposit/withdrawal of funds to trading accounts?-  How long do deposits/withdrawals take before they post to the account?-  How are differences in matching bid ask offer prices resolved?  For example if Alice puts up 50 bitcoins for sale at $1.00/BTC and Bob puts in a buy offer of $1.10/BTC, at what price will the deal close?  Does the deal always get closed on the lower, or the higher amount, halfway in between, at the price of the first person to post their offer?-  Is trading by bots allowed on the market?-  Whether you allow bot trading or not, is there a mechanism by which machine readable market data is made available and is there a way for bid/ask offers to be posted or canceled other than through the standard web interface?-  Is historical data on the closing trades available, and to whom is it available?  Is the full historical data of all bid/ask offers made available even if the offers did not fill, is this data even stored at all?-  Are there minimum or maximum times that bid/ask offers are valid for?  For example, can an offer be made and then canceled immediately, or must it remain on the market for at least some length of time?  Is there a maximum lifetime for offers or will old offers be removed from the market by the operator?-  What are the opening/closing hours of trading on the market (and what timezone is used for this)? I have actually put in about 30 hours or so on the mturk website as a personal experiment to see how the system worked, whether it could be profitable to do it for a living, etc.  The answer I found was largely no (i earned about $35 dollars so almost exactly $1 per hour), however there are a lot of problems with the mturk site that if they were resolved I thought it could be much more effective.One of the most obvious things is that they offer "qualifications" so that you can show you are likely going to the tasks correctly and thus ask for higher pay (since the job submitter doesn't have to give the task out 5 times to make sure its done right).  The problem is that the qualifications are not standardized and there is no way to search for tasks that you are qualified for (you can hide tasks for which you are unqualified but there is no way to show _only_ tasks that require qualifications that you have).This makes it harder for skilled workers to find jobs (thus driving them out of the market) and it leaves only the people who do the tasks poorly because they don't have the proper skills, or the people who are willing to work for a few cents per hour.  This is apparently a well documented economics phenomena called a "lemon market" and there is a pretty good blog about its relation to mturk here:  http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2010/07/mechanical-turk-low-wages-and-market.htmlI think the mturk idea was a good one, it is just that amazon doesn't seem to interested in developing it (I signed up something like a year a go and I have yet to see a single change to any aspect of the website).  I think something like this is naturally suited to bitcoins and would really be a boon to the bitcoin community as people could earn bitcoins by actually doing something rather than just mining (nothing wrong with mining, I do it myself, but eventually the bitcoin economy actually has to produce something).-Buck That's too bad that they are gone, I did think they looked pretty nice.  Keeping them clean/dry would be no problem for me I just wanted to make sure they were safe.  If you get your facilities back up and running let us know.-Buck Would you be interested in selling any of the knives in the pictures posted, or is the offer only for new work?  I would be interested in buying one of them, what would you consider a fair price?  I am most interested in one of the three in the bottom of you first picture.  Also, do you know what alloys the chain used consisted of, I am wondering whether the knives would be safe to use for food, etc.-Buck
After discussing it with the other developers we have decided that we are not going to use the models on your site as they are not created as characters for the OD game and we don't want to re-use content designed for other things.  I do like your work though and think $25 would be a fair price for some of those.  The original offer still stands though if you get bored someday and feel like making one of the creatures on our wiki.-Buck Your offer of $25 for models on your page sounds like something we could do.  I am not willing to pay 300 per model at this stage because we don't even know for sure we will use all the creatures we are currently talking about so I don't want to invest too heavily into any one model yet, maybe in the future though if the game does well.  I have posted a reply over in the Open Dungeons forum to about which models I think look interesting so our other developers can look at them and see what we want.  You are welcome to jump into that thread as well if you want to participate in that discussion as well.  I think for a license we would want CC-BY-SA but I would also have to confirm that with the other developers, I don't remember what we are using for the artwork right offhand.-Buck I am willing to pay more than that for good models as I made clear in my original post.  I am not looking for completed works, just something that has roughly the size and shape of the intended creature to allow for testing of animation speeds, onscreen size, etc.  We also need to tune how many hitpoints creatures have and what kind of damage they do and if you have models for them (even very rough ones) it makes that process much easier.  Hence I was offering something like 10 to 20 dollars per model for just a basic mesh and very rough animations (just enough to work out the timing with sounds, animation length, speed, etc).The list you gave is an accurate list for a fully constructed model which should cost in excess of 100 dollars for a good one, however what I am looking for here is more like 3d concept art, or a mockup of what the finished game should look like.  If anyone is interested but feels the prices or approach I am offering is incorrect please let me know.-Buck I have been trying to help get the bitcoin labor market going as well, however there doesn't seem to be nearly as much interest in it as in the market for tangible goods and server hosting.  I have put up threads asking for people to do artwork (3d modeling and animation) for me, as well as offering my mapping services on the Open Street Map project and neither one has garnered much interest.  If you are interested in earning some BTC Kiba, I will reverse my mapping offer as well.  I.e. if you want to do some mapping on any of the places I have posted links to in my posts I will pay you the amounts listed for the work you do, up to 50 BTC.  If you do decide to work on some of those places where I have listed offers though, please start working on a new portion of the city away from where I am mapping since it will be easier to see who did what if we each work on a separate area.  Also, my offers still stand for developing 3d models/animations for the open dungeons project.  There are threads here and on the OD forums where the details are laid out.I would like to see more of this kind of thing done and at the very least, some discussion of the practicalities of paying people for labor/services through the bitcoin system.  How should wages be determined?  Should they be tied to something like the MtGox exchange rate or should they be negotiated purely in BTC?  There are probably lots of other questions like this that could be discussed that would yield useful insight.-Buck I would like to offer my services doing mapping work for the Open Street Map project.  I have done quite a bit of work for the project already and as such am able to map and properly tag almost anything that is visible from the satellite photos.  For a fee I will map any area of the world that has aerial photography available.  The price would be dependant on what you would like mapped but it wouldn't be very much in terms of a per hour fee.  Below I have posted some links to work I have previously done for the project so you can see what can be done and approximately what quality of work you can expect to recieve for the area you request mapping for.  I can map anything you can see in the imagery available from the satellite photos at Yahoo maps or Bing maps.  I will have the rest of the week available to work on this project full time.I think this is a good way to help both the Open Street Map project as well as the bitcoin economy.  If others would like to offer their services in a similar fashion make a post in this thread containing your OSM username as well as links to some examples of your work and prices like I have provided and I will try to edit this post to keep all the current offers in the first post of this thread.---------------------OSM Username: AndrewBuckMandan, ND, United StatesI have added all the buildings visible here (approximately 1/3 of the  downtown) -- 0.5 BTC per city blockOther features in the city (baseball diamonds, sidewalks, bikepaths, etc) -- 5 BTC per hourFargo, ND, United StatesBuildings -- 0.5 BTC per city blockIbadan, NigeriaI have done almost all of the main cluster of streets, rivers, and marketplaces here -- 5 BTC per square mileFaisalabad, PakistanThe area in the lower left of what has been mapped was done by me (this is where the hi-res imagery begins) -- 1.0 BTC per square mile Yeah, I was counting a texture as part of the mesh.  Neither the mesh or texture need to be of finished quality, just something that works well enough so you can see what creatures are there and roughly what they should look like in the finished game.  That way we can see how everything works together before we get to far along on the individual models.-Buck I am the lead coder on the OpenDungeons project, which is an attempt to remake the classic Dungeon Keeper games.  In order to help both the development of the game as well as the bitcoin project I have decided to offer payments of bitcoins to people who contribute 3d animation to the project.  I have put in 200 bitcoins and one of the other developers has offered $50 which can be used to buy more btc if the supply of 200 runs out.I am looking for 3d meshes for creatures, as well as skeletons and a basic set of animations for each.  The work does not have to be super high quality since they are just meant to be used for testing/concept development, but I will consider paying higher than the amounts listed for models which are of sufficiently high quality.The forum post with up to date offers of what we are looking for can be found at the beginning of this thread on our forum.http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=790Hopefully there will be some 3d artists here that are interested.-Buck So basically what you are saying is that the program you are writing, one which you expect people to do banking and financial transactions with, should have undocumented interfaces available only to the people who dig through the sourcecode -- and then even then after finding these interfaces they should have no indication of whether they are meant to be there (and were left out of the docs by accident) or whether they could be removed/changed at any time.The -printblock command is an excellent interface for other people to build frameworks that want to study the usage and scalability of the client.  The -noirc command would be good for privacy concerned people who want to limit how much they advertise their presence on the network.  The -dropmessagetest would be very useful to the guy who built a modified client with a new blockchain to form a test network for security/scalability testing.  All of these are "for developers only" according to your definition, even though they are quite useful.I have spent the last week setting up a build environment, learning your codebase, helping people on IRC, and writing tools to make the bitcoinmarket function more effectively.  In addition to that I spent ~2 days preparing the man page so others wouldn't have to spend as much time doing the same thing.  I did this with the intention of improving the client as well as the protocol since I think the idea behind the program is a brilliant one.  Frankly however, given your approach to the open-source development process, I am beginning to think my time would be better spent elsewhere.I have posted the current version of the man page to the wiki here if anyone is interested in using it.  I may or may not continue to develop the client, but will likely continue to work with Dwdollar on the market stuff.-Buck Traktion, you could try running the client with -minimizetotray that seemed to work for me (10.04 as well).  It will start minimized there so you need to click on it to get the main window but it seems to work after that.-Buck I wondered if they were not really meant to be public facing.  I think they are useful to have documented though, at least for now.  If the program accepts it as valid input it should be documented.  You can either add a notice to the commands in the man-page that are experimental, or just remove them.  In my opinion it makes more sense to label them experimental so people know they might change, but can use them if they need to.  I would just add the following to the beginning of each of the commands in the makefile:\fBUnsupported - Behaviour may change in future versions\fRThe \fB switches on bold text and the \fR switches back to regular.  This way people can use the program to its fullest potential during the development stages.  Too much documentation is never a bad thing, especially for an open source project.  Since people can see the code they will find these calls anyway and use them whether you want them to or not.  If they are documented and marked as volatile then people can at least make an informed choice on whether or not they want to use them.For example, just at the moment someone in IRC is making use of the -printblock command to generate statistics about the block chain that might help us understand the program better (as in how it performs in the real world).  Although the output of this command may change in the future, and therefore we shouldn't be building complex frameworks around it, it is nice to know it exists if you need something done as a quick hack.  Also because the program is open source, if someone comes to depend on a certain command line switch they can maintain it.  Eventually what you thought was just a temporary debugging tool make end up being one of the most widely used switches available.-Buck I am aware that 1 is plenty for proper functioning, but more connections helps prevent the network from becoming segmented.  I was just wondering if there was a limit because I am always at 15 which seemed odd to me.Anyway in regards to the question I think the protocol itself should support some kind of mechanism like this as it is good to know.  As far as I understand it the IRC server is more of a temporary thing until a more permanent solution is implemented.  This will probably have to happen sooner, rather than later, since the growth of the system will soon overwhelm the IRC server.  It is also somewhat of a single point of failure, even though the clients have other ways of finding eachother losing the IRC server could end up fragmenting the network causing several "islands" of interconnected nodes.  If this islanding persisted for long enough transactions could be lost.-Buck Thanks Insti.  I got the man page written.  I documented all of the command line switches the program supports, not just the ones in the usage output given by "bitcoin -h".  Any of the ones that do not appear in the usage output should have a comment in the man page file noting this (comment lines start with   ."   which is a period then a double quote).I provided the update as a patch since I also made some changes to the sourcecode itself.  If you want to install the man page first extract it from the diff file with the patch program and then copy the file "bitcoin.1" to section 1 of you man pages.  On my Ubuntu systems the directory /usr/local/man/man1/ serves as a good place to keep it.  Actually on my systems I put a symlink from there to the bitcoin/trunk/bitcoin.1 file so it stays up to date if it gets updated in SVN.I have also exported the man page using man2html and will post this to the wiki so people can reference it without having to install it on their systems, as well as for the underprivileged Windows users who have to forgo the true awesomeness of the man page system.  Attached to this message you should find a zip file with the patch in it.EDIT:  The wiki doesn't seem to be sending the registration e-mail so I can log in to edit, is there some problem with the server or something?-Buck Sorry to keep replying to myself but I am posting these little snippets as I stumble across them.  I am currently documenting the -dropmessagestest command line switch and I see a minor improvement you may want to add to the code.  Currently if a message is dropped as a result of this switch, a debug message is printed to the log indicating a message was dropped.  It would probably be pretty useful to print the contents of the dropped message to the log as well.  This way if one of the dropped messages really does break bitcoin, you can see what message caused the problem.  It would also allow you to later re-create the problem by adding a filter on the incoming network stream blocking messages like the one that broke it the first time so that you can verify that you have fixed the issue later on.If you think it is a good idea I can probably add this myself as well.-Buck I am still crunching along on the man page, it is starting to look pretty good.  I did come across a couple of issues though.  First, there is a "-printtodebugger" command line option.  I added it to the "usage" information when you give -h and I also added it to the man page but I can't tell what it does by looking at the code, other than to see that it is only used on windows machines.Secondly, in the process of investigating the OutputDebugStringF() function I discovered that the code has the ability to output to a console by setting the global variable fPrintToConsole to true.  The variable, however, was initialized to false and there was no where in the code that sets it to true.  Because of this I added a -printtoconsole which sets both this variable and fDebug to true.  I think both should be set but I am wondering if I should leave fDebug alone.  If I don't set it in the code then the user would have to do "-printtoconsole -debug" on the command line instead, we may or may not want this depending on whether there is more/less verbosity implied by debug but from a quick grep of the code it looks like it should be the way I currently have it where it automatically sets both variables.-Buck The network will see that there is a previous recorded transaction where you transferred those coins to someone else and so it will know you don't really have them.  Therefore it will reject your second transfer as invalid.  This is also how the network protects against someone just editing their wallet.dat file to give themselves a bunch of coins.By the way, I don't suggest trying this as someone posted in another thread that they tried a similar thing as a test and ended up losing a bunch of coins in the process.  The network will not punish you for this (i.e. he did not lose his coins as a punishment) it was just some weird interaction between the client and the wallet file (the exact details elude me at the moment).-Buck How is it that you get more than 15, all of my clients exactly level out at 15 and never go higher like there is some hard limit imposed.  Did you have to tweak the source to make that happen?-Buck I'm not sure about SMS, however someone somewhere did mention the idea of a lightweight client to use on smartphones.  I am not from India but according to Shashi Tharoor, almost every Indian small business (people doing housework, ironing clothes, taxis, etc) all have a cell phone that people call them on to take orders.  (Very interesting TED talk where this came from is here it is well worth your time to watch).  If you are taking orders with the phone, why not take payment as well and avoid the risk of carrying money around as well as the hassle of making change.  You could even make it so the cell phone the business owner is carrying only carries his "recieve account number" with his main account being somewhere else so if someone tried to steal his phone they could not transfer the money out.I could see something like the ability to make/take payments via two cell phones held by people who are face to face exchanging goods/services in person being a huge thing in this kind of Indian exchange (or anywhere else for that matter).  This could be the thing that really leaps bitcoin into widespread use.-Buck I don't know anything about JSON and my knowledge of website design is quite limited so I will be of no use here.  I do have pretty extensive C++ knowledge though so I should be able to do a bit of work on the codebase.I am currently tweaking the commandline handling a bit to make it behave more like the standard unix/linux command line (specifically I am adding -h to display help).  I also plan to get the man-page text written up based on the current code.I will put the man page on the wiki when I get it written, where should I submit the patch for the source code?EDIT:  Actually since I am writing the man page in the man page markup language I will include this in the patch as well since it would look like nonsense on the wiki.-Buck No problem, that is why I asked about documentation before I started writing it.  I still would like to document it though and maybe we can come to some system which you would find acceptable.  One possible way is that I just run Doxygen on my own code and just use the auto-generated docs without adding any descriptions, etc.  This would have no impact on the project and myself or anyone else could do this whenever but it limits the usefulness of the documentation.A second, and perhaps more appealing method would be to utilize the fact that Doxygen does not require the added documentation to be in the same file as the source code it is documenting.  We could add a single file that contains the documentation blocks with links pointing to the function names.  Doxygen then combines this with the auto-generated info it collects from the source to produce the docs.Finally, whether we use Doxygen or not, I would like to write a "man page" for the program documenting the command-line options it takes.  Where is the command line processed in the code?  I looked at main.cpp and didn't see it (in fact I couldn't even find the "main" function).-Buck I didn't think this would be something people would object to.  Hopefully I hear definitively from Satoshi that it is OK.  I will probably start working on this tonight then (tonight in USA time).  Also, I saw another thread questioning how to send in patches; the stated answer was that we should e-mail them to Satoshi, is this still the preferred method?-Buck
