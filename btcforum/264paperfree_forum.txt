Found a typo in the 2.4 guide on step 22 for the 32-bit version:32-bit 22. ./configure.py --cl-inc-dir=/opt/AMD-APP-SDK-v2.4-lnx6432/include/ --cl-lib-dir=/opt/AMD-APP-SDK-v2.4-lnx32/lib/x86the highlighted 64 should be removed.I was having the same problem as Schizo during the make -j3 step:src/wrapper/wrap_cl.hpp:20:19: fatal error: CL/cl.h: No such file or directorycompilation terminated.error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1make: *** [all] Error 1After fixing the typo, this error went away, and now everything seems to be working great! 100/day seems pretty good... Does internet connection speed matter?  Also, does it matter how long your computer has been continuously connected? Thanks for doing this.  Your post is how I discovered Bitcoin! I only have a 1Ghz netbook running bitcoin at the moment, so I'm curious what kind of bitcoin generation rates the faster computers get.  100/week, 1000/week, 10000/week?  How big of an advantage is there to having a faster computer?
