Lol I know! Don't remind me...Amazing how things can change over time, just not the forum software.Oh well, I love theymos anyway  I'm thinking sub $100 before this bear is over, but then again, I'm the crazy one who thinks the bear market still hasn't really even started  This scenario would be extremely bullish, and bullish for many years This is true You never know - if Bitcoin falls an additionally from here and he buys them back cheaper, he's going to look like he has smart hands.Don't assume you know the future. The bear market is well underway but damn I can't wait for a *real* crash to start. I thought maybe it would happen in October but I still haven't gotten the right setup yet. Maybe November or December now. We shall see. Deflation is spreading!http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-17/butter-prices-tumble-most-in-18-years-as-imports-climb.html It will. The FBI is very interested in Shavers. The SEC case was just the civil case. The criminal case is coming next. Except that the bear market hasn't even started yet. Stocks are at highs and I'm still waiting for my setup to short the hell out of them as deflation unfolds, the dollar soars, and all assets collapse. We're not quite there yet.Remember: The ones that are up the most, are the ones that go down the most. Agreed that we're on a cusp of a big sell off.As for a 1929/1987-style crash, however, we're not there yet. Wait for a 3-of-3, which will take some time to get to. I agree with this. The error the OP is making is that he's using sentiment in a quantitative manner. However, the market is a fractal. To end a bear market, we need to see sentiment comensurately negative relative to the optimism seen near the highs. If you recall how insane this bubble/mania got, then you'll realize it's going to take one hell of a rout to properly retrace I'm so sorry you're going through this.If it makes you feel any better, I have had severe chronic pain (specifically, a condition known as chronic myofascial pain, similar to but not to be confused with fibromyalgia) for the last two and a half years. At its worst I could barely even walk and pretty much only morphine could help; I seriously considered suicide as a rational method of escaping the unrelenting physical agony. But thankfully I've been slowly improving with therapy (the Stanford/Wise-Anderson Protocol) and today I'm able to walk and drive a car again and as of Janurary I could finally get off the pain meds. I still have a long ways to go, however, before I beat this thing. So things can get better my friend. Don't give up yet, look into your treatment options. If you need someone to talk to, just pm me and i'll give you my number Wow evolve I had no idea that bulls think prices are going up, and bears think they're going down. Thanks for letting me knowThat said, I clarified the OP slightly, because you are caught up in terms and obviously don't understand my partitioning and therefore the point I'm making Just broke $266, which was the high of wave 3. This is significant for psychological reasonsAnd yet, in my estimation, and the coming mean-reversion bounces notwithstanding, the bear market in Bitcoin is just getting started Just broke $266, which was the high of wave 3. This is significant for psychological reasonsAnd yet, in my estimation, and the coming mean-reversion bounces notwithstanding, the bear market in Bitcoin is just getting started Hit $302 on gox! Man, I love crashes. Now we just need the freaking U.S. markets to start playing catch-up and collapse already Much lower Yeah very few of the general population grok bitcoin Bitcoin plunges as major exchange halts withdrawalshttp://money.cnn.com/2014/02/07/investing/bitcoin-withdrawal-halt/ Bitcoin plunges as major exchange halts withdrawalshttp://money.cnn.com/2014/02/07/investing/bitcoin-withdrawal-halt/
This is entirely possible. I am basing my bearish opinion on the strong correlation between bitcoin and stocks since its inception, and the fact that stocks appear to have (finally) turned. If the correlation fails, or if stocks have not begun a bear market, then i will be wrong on this call.And yes, I thought the 266 peak in April was a major top and i didn't see the next bull since we didn't get oversold enough. That surprised me and it could definitely happen again. The point of this thread is to debate the future price direction of bitcoin, not to devolve into personal attacks against me. For those who want debate im all ears, but i have now put several posters on ignore, thanks. And any more that want to post pointless personal attacks will be put on ignore too I bought coins at 6 cents and again between $3 and $5. The explosion from 6 cents *drawfs* the move from $50. Those were the best buying opportunities: buy when there's blood on the street. I don't like to buy when everyone loves Bitcoin, and we didn't reach a negative enough sentiment during the decline that happened last April.*Of course* a contrarian methodology is not perfect - obviously! You are not telling me any new information. And anyone who believes a perfect methodology exists obviously has no market experience. But contrarianism has worked well for me over the long haul, especially the killing I made during the 2008 crash when all my friends were losing their shirts, an event that we are likely to repeat soon. I may have been too early on stocks but given just how much more profitable stock market crashes are than equity bull markets, it won't matter. The magnitude of overbullishness and the length of time stocks have remained overbought should be commensurate with the size of the next bear marketI can't stand these hindsight biased comments, but I recognize the psychological tendency Exactly Right. The long-term count since the inception of the currency shows a completed impulse. That's a big deal. Cool thanks yeah this is similar to my thinking. We've had no significant corrections since 2011 - it's overduePeople have completely forgotten how large that decline was, over 90% Yerp. And what forum section are we in, again?  It seems that broad public opinions on Bitcoin are *primarily* divided into two categories:(1) PERMA-BULLS: People who grok Bitcoin, and thus are perma-bulls (most of this forum)(2) PERMA-BEARS: People who do not grok Bitcoin, and thus are perma-bears (Paul Krugman, Peter Schiff, etc.)I would like to propose a third, new, much rarer category:(3) OPTIMISTIC BEARS: People who grok Bitcoin and believe in its future, yet acknowledge that, at present, Bitcoin and especially alt-coins are still in the midst of a major speculative bubble that must deflate before the next growth phase can begin.If you're in category 3, then please join me in this thread. Welcome to the home of the optimistic bears. I would like to hear from you. 1st impulse to the downside in stocks is complete. So we should continue to rally for a little while (a couple weeks maybe); if we don't immediately rally, then we will soon enough. Regardless, then comes wave 3 down, which should be significantly larger than the first decline - and taking the S&P into the 1600s or lowerNot sure when Bitcoin will follow. If not during this next decline, then it may be a few more months before Bitcoin follows (when a decline begins in the S&P that's yet another one degree larger).I'm hoping that some of my favorite indicators will provide a bearish signal near the top of the rally so I can get some leverage in place before the next fall. Personally, I think we're heading for double-digits. But it could take a couple years to get there. Stocks are doneBitcoin should eventually follow if the correlation is to continue Funny, an ending diagonal is also in formation on the dow transports I agree with proudhon. Bitcoin is in an epic bubble. When it finally pops, a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money Oh cool thanks, I guess he just changed URLs is all Could you guys help me out?I used to like bitcoinblogger, but it's no longer up. $830 is continuing to act as massive resistance. This is good news for the bearish case. This is entirely probable based on technical analysis alone, but not that quickly. Maybe in two years we are going much lower than that A while ago I would have said windows is a fine choice. But now wih the revelations regarding NSA backdoors, I'd say these days you absolutely have to go with an open-source OS. Agree completely on this, fits with my timeframe projections as well.All of these epic, once-in-a-lifetime super-bubbles (stocks, bonds, housing, crypto-currency, and more) will ultimately collapse. Comparing now to the end of the roaring 20s doesn't do today justice... you'd have to go all the way back to the South Sea bubble to find comparable financial psychology.
It's a super-bubble IMO. So I guess that makes me one of the few remaining people who are not buying. It probably has more to go though. It seems bubbles are pervasive at the moment across many asset classes:http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-11-22/david-stockman-blasts-its-20078-all-over-againOf course, I've noticed these bubbles for a while now and have talked of their bursting, but it seems that some just keep getting bigger. Figuring out exactly when they'll pop is the hard part. So do as you will. Pirateat40 I can be early and still be right about the deflationary hypothesis. It will be very profitable, but I have not yet gotten the signals I need to take particularly aggressive action. Again, I'm hoping that the October time-frame will provide this.If you think getting every call right at both a long-term and intermediate-term time-frame is an appropriate standard to be held to, then good luck finding that holy grail. Finally some stuff is happening. It's still early though, I don't expect any really big moves until October, which is the usual crash season. S&P is in a short-term rally but when this ends - look out! Bitcoin should follow this time given the size of the moves I expect to unfold in other financial markets Agreed. Also, it's worth keeping in mind that things still haven't heated up yet in terms of the larger bear market in asset prices across the board. These things take time. But we have a nice impulse down in stocks finally so the larger trend there is down. No, it's *good* to see lots of bullish expectation if you want the price to go down  This is one of the most bearish threads I've seen in a while:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=282423.0Hope is rampant Could be a 1-2-1-2 I guess. I'm not taking off my shorts, if that's what you mean But my point is that the dow and s&p can be counted as a complete impulse down now. That means longer-term trend is down, but we could get a short-term rally at any time. It's near its end. Triple zigzag cannot subdivide much more. Also the metals have hit close to 90% bulls, which seem to have been correlated with the latest rise in btc.In other news, S&P finally gave us a nice 5 waves down. So it should rally soon to correct this new motive wave, but then get ready for a collapse... timing could easily be October, as with past crashes. Be careful. While it's exceedingly overbought and certainly in a bubble (which will ultimately pop), equity strength usually continues in the absence of major divergences. I don't know what's going to happen with Bitcoin but the stock and bond markets are toast. Major top with huge divergence in the A/D line. Get ready guys... crash season is coming (September/October/November)   S&P probable top - this time non-confirmation on the A/D line, which is the first top we've had since 2009 with this. Also hindenburg omens and titanic up the wazoo, this is pretty rare.Does this mean Bitcoin will follow? I don't know, but 'tis the season for crashes coming (September, October) Marc Faber: Look out! A 1987-style crash is cominghttp://www.cnbc.com/id/100950234 Should lead to another large wave down. We've got a hindenburg omen and a titanic on the s&p, not to mention a very nicely completed wave up at multiple degrees.I'd like to see the dollar bottom and interest rates to increase more, however. Both of which should be forthcoming, but the usd has a bit more to fall first imo. It's usually weak prior to market crashes, and strengthens into the decline. That's like saying assembly can do what C does, so why use C?C# is a higher level language than C++, which means more programmer productivity - at the cost of some performance, of course.Personally, I go as high level as possible (python,awk,lisp,etc) until I need more non-I/O performance. Then you look down the list toward java/C# and finally C/C++ if you really need it for time critical pieces of code. If you lean towards high level languages, you'll get stuff done waaay faster and with fewer bugs- a former/reformed C++ fanatic Yep. I second Firefly. Wave 4 cannot overlap the territory of wave 1, so blue labels are invalid Well, bitcoin, commodities, bonds, etc are following the script so far perfectly, but it's looking like equities are going for one more new high. Very frustrating having to wait for this next bear to start. The internals were quite strong today. Thanks mate! Yeah I'm far more bearish on Bitcoin than anyone else I've come across (aside from the idiots that don't grok Bitcoin of course)... but super-long-term I still strongly believe in crypto-currency technology. I'm basing my multi-year bear market opinion on BTC on the fact that (1) I believe it's a "risk-on" asset, not a "risk-off" and (2) I believe the top is one degree larger than the 2011 bubble, and thus the resulting bear should be commensurate with that (3) my estimated time-frame for the the Kondratieff cycle to bottom, which should include equities, real-estate, bonds, and commodities. It will eventually end when all the debt is destroyed (along with most of the financial system) and then deflation will run out of steam and yield to the inflation that the Fed will create in response. That's when I'm going to be buying Bitcoins again.Honestly though, the most imminent big trade is not in Bitcoin IMO, it's short the S&P. I think the top is in as of the ATH @ 1687.18. This next year or two should be a wild ride once we start to finish these stupid 1-2s and get some real downside momentum going 
Really good call on this!On a wave basis, we have 9 waves down from the July 21st high - specifically, looking like a wave 4 finished near $100 and we had a fifth wave impulse down from there to complete a larger impulse (9 waves visible on a chart is typical because it means one of the impulse waves extended, giving you 1-2-3-4-(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5) in this case). So we could easily mean-revert back to $100 from here as a correction of the burgeoning Wave C downtrend. I think he means short-term buy, as in f( timeframe, direction )  I gained a lot of weight as a result of meds I was on. Unfortunately I cannot exercise due to exteme pain and muscle dysfunction. The counter this, all I did was simply (1) cut back on carbs and (2) eat more veggies and fruits and (3) no eating after dinner. This affects me particularly because I'm a night person: I have little appetite during the day and a huge appetite at night - not sure why it just seems to be baked into my genes (also hotter at night, higher energy, increased heart rate, etc.) Yet avoiding food in the evening does not seem to increase my appetite during the subsequent day. Not sure why though.Ended up losing 25 lbs pretty fast with these simple changes. Unfortunately, now I'm under my target weight and too skinny, but that makes some sense since I cannot bulk my muscles at this time.My conclusion is that dicipline is what matters, and small/sustainable changes can have a big impact over time provided you follow it to the T. Anything extreme just doesn't work, for many reasons... Nice charts lucif.BTW although Wave C has *finally* brought some recognition among bitcoiners that we've been in a bear market since the ATH, there's absolutely no dearth of perma-bulls, and therefore this bear still has a long way to go - please observe the responses to the following post (important psychological statements in bold):Note that he's "considering" but hasn't acted yet, which is the crucial part. Also, the responses are amazing:People will NOT be talking like this at the next major bottom. Exactly... all these other explanations are just... crap Unfortunately this is true.He's probably a drug addict like Trendon Shavers as well (pirate's drug of choice was cocaine); it wouldn't surprise me one bit given the similar behavior here. The nonsensical rants that Meni described fit right in, along with chronic dishonesty and of course criminal behavior. The one piece of good news is that large scale BTC thefts will enable these folks to abuse their drugs ad infinitum, which invariably leads to an early grave. Quite a breakdown today.  This makes me feel sick. Such lament already and yet the bear market in Bitcoin has only barely begun! Absolutely. I'm short everything right now and long the dollar i.e. the deflation trade:"Over the past two weeks or so, we've been seeing a very clear portrait of how sick our economies are. Not that you would know it from reading the press. The term deflation pops up only very cautiously. Could that be because people don't understand what's going on? Or are they simply afraid of the word? This is the real thing, guys. And it's going to hurt."http://theautomaticearth.com/Finance/deflation-by-any-other-name-would-smell-as-foul.html I'm not so sure. A LOT of people are thinking the same thing, and the one market principle I believe in more than waves and psychology is the principle of maximum ruin. I'm not sure the mechanism, but the market will try to prevent that strategy from working, somehow.In any event, if the triangle's upper line holds, then sometime in July we kiss trlple digits goodbye for a long, long time IMO. Personally I can't stand writing code in Java (checked exceptions...), but I do acknowledge that bitcoinj and supernode are much furthur along than any other managed language implementation (such as bitcoin C#)Also, recommend you call the unit XPC LolThe new 2008 has already started, except much worse - this time, treasuries aren't even safe!Nice selloff in bitcoin today right along with everything else (except for the dollar, which should strengthen during a deflationary episode)...  Think wave e is over in btc -> but lucif has it broken below the triangle yet? Agreed. It takes a while for falling prices to register in the PPIFGS, since the economy is such a lagging indicator. The thing I'm watching is the collapse in commodities, especially gold and silver. These types of declines are a precursor to falling prices throughout the economy, and we are at the correct time in the K-cycle for deflation (winter). We are very, very early in this new phase - heck, stocks only topped a few weeks ago! Give it time. Here ya go: I agree. My model is deflation followed by hyperinflation. But don't underestimate the deflationary part of the cycle, it will be (and already is) intense. Deflation is here folkshttp://www.businessinsider.com/the-inflation-predictions-were-just-wrong-and-now-theyre-hurting-people-2013-6 Awesome! I have proposed the "rolling chain" concept myself. It's the future for sure.Do you have a code repository up yet? I absolute would like to contribute to this project. OK, that makes more sense. 50 days is pretty much random IMO. The study I ran shows a strong correlation with the S&P, but that was over all the data. The dollar more or less moves inversely to the S&P, hence my surprise at the OP.
Over what time period??I don't think this correlation is valid - maybe for a very short time period. My own long-term correlation studies (utilizing ALL the data) don't match up with this. Agreed. Very nice... this count would certainly make sense given what every other market is doing (except for the USD, which was up today)BTW, awesome decline in the S&P today... it feels sooooo good to be a bear and finally be making $ again  -> bonds, gold, silver - a real bloodbathI think BTC was up today because people had to buy in order to withdraw from mtgox... but if the correlation is going to continue, it should break once stocks get enough downside momentum going A parabolic move is totally normal in finance! When it's over, just like all the other parabolic moves in financial history, it will jusst plateau and then keep going up!!! Bears are stuuupid trolls who don't know anything!11(Seriously, it was fun calling the top on this last bitcoin bubble within 3 days of the peak, but the backlash was huge...) If Pirate isn't in jail yet, then I wouldn't get your hopes up. But yes, BDT was/is an obvious scam.Unfortunately, governments seems more concerned with shutting down Bitcoin exchanges than prosecuting those who have actually harmed others.To prosecute Alberto, you would need to garner the interest of the Italian equivalent of a district attorney. Maybe now that Bitcoin is front page news, they might be interested in a case involving a million+ dollar theft. True... I'd like to see the $100 support level turn into resistance though... It's going to take some major selling to hold under this important psychological level, but if it does, then we might finally start to see some panic selling http://www.marketwatch.com/story/financial-dominos-falling-one-by-one-2013-06-12?link=MW_story_popular This is big - going to put a vice grip on the overly indebted US economy:http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/in-a-shift-interest-rates-are-rising/?ref=economy I have a feeling that we're entering a time where bears are going to be greatly rewarded. Not just in Bitcoin but across the entire breadth of financial markets. I expect nothing less than an epic crash in stocks, bonds, and commodities once the dangerously overinflated QE bubble really pops. I think this process may have already begun, albiet these things take timeIn the meantime, I especially love how many users are so "confused" by bear markets - they think there must be a fundamental change, like "omg the price fell what's going on what changed?" nothing changed, bitcoin is the same, it's just the psychology around bitcoin that is changing... When the price exploded, people noticed that and rationalized it (cypris, etc.), and now that the price is falling they will find a way to rationalize that too.Anyhoo, very interesting times indeed! When btc was $2, almost no-one was referring to it as an "investment". The investment talk occurs at market highs, not at lows (when, ironically, it actually would be a good investment). Reposting from another thread: The problem is this kind of sentiment.The last bitcoin magazine had an article called "the rise and rise of bitcoin"... They don't realize it, but that means only one thing: bear marketIt's going to take a while but the only way this bear can bottom is when people completely stop viewing bitcoin as an investment Agreed.Deflation confuses most everyone... Glad you're one of the few who gets it I think it's going to take over a year (or more) before it bottoms... So I'm in no rush I think this is the kickoff to a brand new major bear market. The 1687 level on the S&P should hold for many years to come IMO Could be quick, but I think it's much more likely to be a slow and drawn out process Agreed... I've been saying this for a long timeWe're in a bear and it's going to be 2-3 years before we bottom out http://www.businessinsider.com/the-hindenburg-omen-has-appeared-2013-5  S&P Futures are down 10 points.One of my proprietary indicators just gave a major sell signal as of yesterday evening. The last one it gave was in july 2011.If it's prescient again, we could be in for quite a spill here Wooohooooooo!!!
I've been waiting for this reversal a LONG timeIt's time for the bears to take charge again . Lets go! Just hit 92% bulls today! That's it - this is a MAJOR top forming. Crazy. Just hit 90% bulls on the spx futures - insane!Last time we hit this number we fell 20% in the following weeks/monthsPositive seasonals are over as of today. This market could strech more of course, but it's hitting historically overbought levels on multiple time framesThinking all the banks and hedge funds are just blowing up this bubble on momentum plays with newly minted fed money. What a sham. It will end very badly, the big question is when Bitcoin, gold and silver are following the script perfectly, but apparently the stock and bond bubbles have yet to get the messageCan't wait until mid next week when these stupid positive seasonals finally burn out. Then good times will be had by all  Thanks, but this bear is far from over. Bitcoin will decline for at least a year longer, probably more. I think it's over ya'll. Next week seasonals turn bearish again. Stocks and commodities are breaking down again after hitting heavy resistance/trendlines/triple top levels. And the correlation between bitcoin and stocks remains powerfulI think over the next few weeks will be a good time to be a bear  100% agree. With one caveat however, which is the degree: this latest bubble ended a move that's one degree larger than the 2011 bubble, so the subsequent decline should be long and drawn out, but ultimately much deeper. Be prepared for a lot of false rallies that last weeks and weeks, followed by steep drops. We're in one of the largest rallies now, but it should be constrained by the ATH and ultimately lead to a continuation of the bear market. No surprises here, those positive seasonals are still in for another weekSuggest that triangle was wave b and we're starting c up now BeautifulBTW I added to my shorts on the SP500 today. Buying some t-bills for profit safe-keeping if things unfold as I expect; I don't trust the banksPlan to buy bitcoins with both hands eventually but definitely not anytime soon, it has a long ways down to go IMO Nice pop this morning and then reversal in stocksCould be a reversal finally in both equities and BitcoinWave C up in bitcoin still looks smallish though compared to wave A up, but equities are stretched to the max w/o invalidating my top count for the spx... Yes, thanks  Nice impulsive wave c in formation in bitcoin - this is a strong move like a wave 3, yet terminal. Psychology is that everyone expects the old trend to resumeStocks finished a beautiful retracement, right back to kiss the trendline on all major indices. It's at major resistance now, so it has to turn soon or else something else is unfoldingSo pretty major juncture I would say. Seasonals are still positive for another week though, but there's a pretty small gap to the ATH so low risk if you're a bear Yep. That's what I keep telling people, but nobody gets it: Bitcoin is a risk asset. It's not a deflation hedge and an inflation hedge at the same time. It cannot be both. I heard the same arguments about gold but it's finally really starting to crack with the emerging deflationary pressures. It "sounds logical" that Bitcoin would be a disaster hedge, but actual historical trading activity clearly identifies it as a risk asset. That's why it broke out in a parabolic move as stocks made record highs, not while stocks were falling - i.e. people buy bitcoins when they're euphoric, not when they're fearfulBear rally in progress now in both markets IMO... this likely will go higher but the point here is that it should eventually end without making a new ATH in either market. Positive seasonals have been kicking in. Futures down 5 point atm but it seems unlikely that the push higher is over quite yet as the retracement on the spx has been too small. Proly a good opportunity to get more shorts on will present itself soon, and we have a nice ATH to use as a stop levelThe next move down in the spx should be much bigger, and my assumption here is that bitcoin will go down with it. This is just the very, very beginning. We have so much furthur down to go on log scale I get 0.8302335879 as the correlation coefficient, which is pretty decent It could happen... We have positive seasonals until early mayBut i agree $50 will certainly be broken in the next decline, whenever that begins. IMO once the PPI hits strongly negative territory and USD deflation really heats up we're going to see some awesome fireworks across many markets, and this will be very profitable for those on the right side of things.I'm still holding short on the sp500, so far that position has worked out very well. Btw I finally ran a real multi-year correlation study on sp500 and bitcoin in bloomberg software and it came out positive... No surprise here as that's exactly what I've noticed since the earliest days of bitcoin (yet for some reason people argued angrily against the notion that stocks and bitcoin could possibly be correlated! I'll give you a hint though: they are because they're both risk assets and are driven by the same social cycles of greed and fear. It's all psychology...)I need to rerun it though on detrended dataEnjoy,BA It might hold up for a few more days... Friday's A/D on the s&p was quite strongBut i agree longer term this is a bear rally The psychology of those replying on this thread tell me that the bear is still in its infancy Amazing that just days after a parabolic move followed by an 80% crash people are already getting euphoric again about Bitcoin with the recent retracement.I've been around Bitcoin since its inception, and I've watched the psychological shifts. If this truely was a new bull market, nobody would be euphoric about it... It's going to take one hell of a rout to get back to those conditionsThat's why they say bull markets climb a wall of worry, and bear markets slide down a slope of hope Bear market rallyIf it was a new bull, nobody woud be euphoric about itThat's why bulls climb a wall of worry, and bears slide down a slope of hope Your statement seems logical, yet financial markets are rarely logical or rational... Prepare to be surprised at what they can do 
I'm the biggest Bitcoin fanboy ever, but that doesn't change my resolution that we've started a multi-year bear market Just a typical bear market rally The spx had some nice trendline breakage today. "I am very excite" I think it will eventually break that trend-line to the downside, but then again I'm a super-bear  Obvious bubble was obvious.But there's a lot more to the storyHold on and stay tuned for more deflatonary fireworks. Bitcoin, gold, and now the s&p are joining in on the funStay short or die-BA I'm talking about what's starting up now, not what has already occurred. So troll away but I'm right - the world wide credit bubble is popping. Right now. Stay tuned for more deflationary fireworksA fun day today, for starters: http://www.businessinsider.com/gartman-in-four-decades-of-trading-gold-i-have-never-seen-anything-like-this-crash-2013-4 Gold and silver are tanking, Bitcoin is crashing, the PPI is falling sharply... Mmmmmm-mmm smells like deflation is back. I just wonder when the S&P will finally get the messagehttp://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/12/us-producer-prices-idUSBRE93B0J920130412 The S&P is next on the list, guys, and also junk bondsBitcoin is only the first iceberg This is exactly what I expected. IMo This was a classic bubble, a speculative fifth wave/ending move. Not a third wave with strongly improving fundamentals. I think pretty much the whole thing will be retracedSo yeah I'm as bearish as Proudhon these days... Everything is going... According to plan I'm a happy bear! The very fact that nearly everyone is still insanely bullish implies that the price needs to continue declining from the $266 peak for a while to complete a proper correctiongive it time No, it can't, because wave 4 never enters the price territory of wave 1. Cardinal rule. Agreed. lucif thinks $32 should hold if this entire move is a high-degree 4th wave (the first bubble would be wave 1 and this last bubble wave 3)personally I think only equity indices have long-term counts, and due to the strong correlation, i think bitcoin could easily end up going down with the index when it turns - far more than anyone else thinks it will. So i'm not getting back into BTC yet...we shall see what happens  Some at $100 and some at $143 Bumpity bump bump Today:    High:$266.00000    Low:$135.78600funny i thought stocks would have turned first, not bitcoinbut a 50% crash in one day is the largest down move yet, so I think it's significant Good trade, I'm jelly  Pirate stole all the coins - they're gone. You expect Nick to buy them back at over $200 a pop? That would make him a debtor for life as coins continue to go up in value... and you'd still never get all your coins back.It really sucks man but suck it up, accept your personal mistake to become involved in the bitcoin credit markets, and move on understanding "neither a lender nor a borrower be". At least Nick is paying the USD amount, which is amazing and rare considering the circumstances. Most other deposit takers have simply dissapeared.Most importantly, however, Nick isn't and shouldn't give any one depositor special treatment. No.Lucif means that a drop (large scale 4th wave) cannot penetrate the price area of the last bubble (large scale 1st wave). If it does, then the current bubble cannot be counted as a large scale 3rd wave.
I don't know if you guys realize this, but most of the passthru operators are broke as f***. They were the diehards that got in deep with Trendon and lost the most. The idea that they were "in on the scam" is total BS Hah, I think I'm the only person on the planet left who actually thinks this is exactly how it'll play outMaybe Proudhon too... Not sure about suicides, but this bubble will end like all other bubbles: a lot of ruin for a lot of people. I agree with this. When the parabolic rise breaks, it's going to crash hard and for a long time IMO.This community was the best and the most fun when coins were 6 cents and you had to buy them with cash in the mail. Fun times  Yeah, interesting how it keeps accelerating - take a look at log scale, it accelerates there too. Not normal behavior, but totally classic for bubblesthere's a major fibbo relationship at 207, so that's a potential target where the vertical rise would be 1.618 times the length of the first three waves off the 1.99 low (in log scale terms) Thanks mate. Proly true... but I'm thinking this is big wave 5 off the $0 low, and bitcoin is set to decline deeply for a long, long time. At least most analysts I've shown ths charts to think this looks like "an ending move", and it matches up with the S&P which finished potentially the most major top in all of history. The first bitcoin bubble was wave 3 a la 1929, and now we're nearing the big top a la 2000. Waves 1 and 2 were likely the moves up to 6 cents from 0 and then a correction back to 1 cent. Usually bubbles don't happen in first waves, only 3 and especially 5. Nobody notices 1st waves...But I still have to give the probability in favor of your count i.e, it being a big 3 by what is visible on a chart, i'm just saying a big 5 is probably a valid potential alternative.I think the sudden realization that bitcoin cannot scale and that altcoins will be risng in popularity will make people realize just how much they overexposed themselves to a single blockchain. Don't get me wrong I love bitcoin but the hype != reality here, it's cannot be the world currency anytime soon if it can barely handle the traffic from satoshidice 8SEF9QaFthfEqmNwRX81Y1nhLAscLn5Sggthanks in advance, this is fun! The DEFlATION trade is back, baby! Hark from 2008... Thiz one's going to be much bigger... Long the dollar, short the s&p... I'm ready for all this bubble crap to burn down  Obvious scam is obvious.Never lend anyone coins. I made that mistake once and I regret it every day. Looks like one to me:  Burn, baby, burn!This is all playing out to script perfectly. The SEC will handle that I can confirm this is accurate. Very likely he will end up in prison. That will be a good day for the Bitcoin community. S&P down 17 points... so far so good  Enjoy, No, I sold out already. I did put on some short exposure to stocks though.Commodity blowoffs are too risky. Best strategy is to just get off the bus and wait it out. This is awesome I'm so excited... I'm so bearish now I can barely contain myself! A pretty big correction. After that I don't know
Lol no I think it's probably topping within 24-48 hours... but it's just that I've seen these situations many times before and often tops can take longer thsn you anticipate. So don't be too aggressive if you're bearish is my only point here, based on experience. You make better decisions if you underleverage Nice. I sold a few coins @ $100. Proly could have held out for more but I really think we're topping as well, and it's going to be epic. I also just put on a few short positions on the S&P500. Give it a couple weeks I think everything is going to roll over here. Nevermind, found that I can just parse the html on http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#tgSzm1g50zm2g200zxzv Oh nevermind, I seeI can parse the html I guess pretty easily...EDIT - or just copy/paste into libreoffice calc LOL Cool - this only goes back a few months though... I need a csv download of all daily data Does anyone have this or know where I can get it?It's quite urgent: I'm trying to get an article published and I'd like to feature a custom chartThanks! Can someone get CSV daily OHLC historical bars for mtgox?If so could you PM me and I'll give you my email address Agreed.This could end up being outsized fifth wave (a blowoff), so calling the exact top is kind of pointless Current position in fractal structure of historical prices Agreed. Not sure. I'm very much looking forward to how this plays out though - sentiment is white hot, and we have a potential 5 of 5 from the 9.77 low in formation... Excellent... We've broken out of wave 4 and are marching through wave 5 to a new high right now... Exactly as anticipated Bytecoin is the future. Bitcoin is so last year... No. It takes a lot of people doing that together in a short span of time to make a bubble.Also, the context is totally different. This is during a parabolic move, not in a lull following a previous crash. Did people sell their houses and put all the proceeds into google shares? I think you're misunderstanding the degree of conviction I'm conveying here that occurs in people's minds at major tops... i.e. contrarianism only works at the very extremes of psychology I don't know that - I'll leave the price calls to Lucif and his charts . All I know is that in financial markets if you reach the point where everyone knows something, then the exact opposite is usually about to occur. 100% agreed. People are calling this "the singularity" even though bitcoin is having trouble with the volume at Satoshi Dice (and that's just one website). Now, Bitcoin still has value of course, but saying it's going to be the new world currency anytime soon is just ridiculous.Other bubble signs include:- people are selling their houses to buy bitcoin- it's all over the news- it's an "investment" now, not a currency like it has been for the past two years. The same change in attitude towards bitcoin occurred in the 2011 bubble- People are cashing out their retirement accounts and going "all in"- all this is happening coincident with another financial bubble in stocks and junk bonds. The mania psychology between multiple sets of markets is no coincidence - it's all part of human herding behavior. The last time bitcoin peaked was in july 2011, coincident with the last major selloff in stocks and also the high of the small caps/large caps ratio (a measure of speculative fever). This time, again, it followed the lead of the stock market and will likely peak around the same time.Agreed here as well. According to Lucif's count, we have one more new high to come before the collapse. lol typo, tks So I'm guessing there will be an upper limit of 2,625,000 bytecoins, correct (i.e. 21 million divided by 8, since there are 8 bytes in a bit). +1
I voted yes. However, I'm more bearish than proudhon - but it needs one more new high to complete the pattern off the 9.77 low prior to crashing. Another week, 2 weeks max -> then panic. Correct. It didn't quite make it. It hit a low of $75 and change, whereas the top of wave 1 was $74.9So it's still a valid count, but it's a close call. I still would count it as a 4. Nothing to see here - just a wave 4.Although this means we're getting close to the end now. We need one more fifth wave up to new highs -> then the big clapooie. I'm even more bearish than you are, but the current dip is just a wave 4 of a larger final blowoff wave 5. It needs one more spurt up to new highs to complete the entire pattern off of the 9.77 low, and that's when the real crash will begin.So: not yet.*note: I don't have a crystal ball Exactly. Not yet - it still needs to finish the last few waves of a parabolic blowoff - see lucif's wave count it's spot onThings are going to get much, much more wacky before sanity returns, like over $200/coin before the next crash startsHave patience http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article5818.htmlEnjoy, Lucif, can you provide an update as to where we are in this trend channel? Almost textbook. And amazing how so few can see this. Good post, thanks They already have a set of people who will be official witnesses. For what I don't know yet, but that sounds like they plan to move it to a court case as the next phase.Legal system is not like bitcoin. It's very, very slow. Also a lot of people are not witnessing because the SEC has been so secretive about their intentions (not to mention it opens yourself up to all government agencies), so right now effectively the SEC is protecting Pirate since their involvement prohibits other lawyers from collecting: the SEC gets "first dibs" always. THAT is the reason you haven't seen anything serious happen yet on the legal front yet, not because people are sitting on their hands. The SEC is moving forward with the case, albeit slowly. Pirate will be going to prison. But these things take time.Enjoy, Agreed  Sounds like the stock market Btw the huge fifth wave blowoff that we're experiencing is more like a commodity market than equities or currenciesThere will be an epic panic when it breaks, although this could begin at much highers levels though given that count (i.e. past $100 or even $200). Underflow? Lets get nuts! Just to back this guy up, an ex girlfriend of mine that I met at MIT makes hundreds of thousands each year running an algorithmic trading system on her brokerage account that she developed. It's entirely based on TA concepts. Most of the best quant firms (Citadel anyone?) build systems based on TA. New research from academia has confirmed that a simple momentum indicator can be used to outperform the indices consistently. The twitter studies are revolutionary in showing how the public's mood precedes changes in market trends.So to all the naysayers: stay stubborn and hostile, claim that only fundamentals matter and that crowd psychology does not, but the behavioral finance revolution is happening with or without your understanding. Damn I was hoping for a breakdown, but with this count it looks like it'll break $100 like a knife cutting through butter, probably quite swiftlyThe wind is with the bulls, for now Bubble bobble?http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/21/crazy-or-crazy-smart-canadian-man-puts-grandparents-house-up-for-sale-for-bitcoins/
Litecoin clearly topped on the 20th, and has been crashing. In fact, all the alt coins seem to have followed the same script. I think this is important - it means the speculative juices have maxxed out on those markets. Bitcoin is bigger and taking longer, but I fail to see why it won't eventually follow suit.Another interesting thing that I've noticed is this tendency for people to claim that "bitcoin does well when bad things happen in the world". This same argument has been used for gold. And yet, so far, the charts tell the opposite story: bitcoin does well when stocks and general financial speculation are high (such as the high in 2011, which perfectly matched the high in the US small caps/large caps ratio), and goes down when speculative fever does. So far when the economy worsens, people want cash, and not gold or bitcoins.Things could change for sure, but I'm just pointing out the hard, cold evidence thus far doesn't match the kinds of fundamental arguments I'm hearing based on past market activity. They sure sound good and logical on paper though, I won't argue with that Where can I look at good litecoin charts? Agreed. Right now most wavers I've asked say it still looks like a small fourth wave that may give way to another ATH, but in that case we're still very close to a major top. Obviously I'm leaning towards the interpreting that the top is already in, but the next week or two and the market should yield its hand. Cool. This is perfectly in line with where I think stocks are poised, except in their case I think the top is already in as of a few days ago.It's funny how the exact same psychological/sentiment backdrop runs through people in different markets at the same time. Euphoria always gives way to fear... Agreed. I love btc and it has a bright future, but this kind of talk is very bubbliciousI liked coins when they were 6 cents, and I liked them at the $2.xx low, but recently I've dramatically slowed my buying to a mere $100/week.I like to buy when the hype is down, not up You know, there's a good chance that we just topped today. Stocks continue to sell off. BTC had a strong reversal after hitting the upper-channel line.I'd like to see it break the lower-channel line though before I change my stance on BTC from bullish to bearish; until then you have to maintain that the trend is still up (i.e. top picking is usually a bad idea). It didn't take much time to hit the upper channel line... This is why I love you, proudhon The trendline I am talking about is very short-term, which is not visible on a daily chart - yet the the the reason it is so prescient right now is because we've finished a clear 5 wave move up over several months. I have been waiting for the very last wave to finish, and so this small break is a signal that a major turn is likely.S&P futures down 16.4 points right now; hoping this is finally the start of something big! It's hard to compete with the trend. If you just watch the ROC you'll be right more often than not.But then again, all this Quantitative Finance stuff is BS in my opinion, you need a qualitative system if you want to avoid burnout. The S&P just broke an important trendline; it will be interesting to see if the correlation continues. If so, I think there's a good chance that Lucif is about to be proven right. Yes. Both ltc and btc are in a bubble atm IMO. Waiting to buy back in at much lower prices. But the s&p needs to turn first. Give it another couple weeks to see if we get a turn. I think it's more about speculation than anything else. I don't see the point of LTC really... I mean, what does it have that BTC doesn't? He still has over 50k of them. Pm me to remind me and i'll dig up the addresses that i traced to from various btcst accounts No. Pirate was a ponzi. Bitcoin is a currency. Ever watch silver trade? It has bubbles and crashes just like bitcoin, yet it's definitely no ponzi. Love it! I was thinking it could entering into a final blowoff top now; my guess is that we'll know by the end of this month. Nice, good job How do you know this for certain?
That would be ideal, but the problem is that the SEC won't talk at all about what's going on. It's policy. So I sent her a funny email the other day, and she said "thanks I needed that, had a terrible day today".Que pasa? My instinct gave me a moment of hope, and it was right on this: a quick FB check and I noticed her relationship status had just been changed to "single". Confirmed!Although I don't wish her any "terrible days", inside I'm just screaming Wooooooooooooooohoooooooo!! Well that's the thing, I think she does have some interest in me. If I was around a few months ago, I think there's a good chance she would be with me and not this other douche. lol trueSo I've thought about the situation long and hard (no pun intended) I think the best advice is really just to move on, as much as that pisses me off and depresses me.If she breaks up with him then I'll move in for the kill, but you can't wait around for people. She's great but she has a certain inertia about her when it comes to making life changes, so my gut is telling me that even if she realized that she liked me better, she may still end up marrying this shmo.So, that's that for now. I'm still crazy about her, but I have too much dignity to waste on a girl that's already taken. I've seen friends waste years on specific girls with no results, and I deserve better than that crap. Yes and this would be 100% true if it were a normal gift, but it's not. Time is of the essence and she needs it now.Anyhoo, thanks everyone but I think I've gotten enough feedback at this point. Can't tell if serious... He's real I could not agree more. You just have to trust me that this gift is an exception.But you're right, it's giving too much off the bat. Maybe I'll still do it, but give her a little more time first. Like you said, "walk the line".Easier said than done though sometimes... discipline... discipline... No clue about the other guy.Not right now... I know a few other girls that seem cool I guess. But I really like this one the best by far... Already done this, we went out during work for about an hour or so, it was great.Now I realize this sounds like "overdoing it", but I have the perfect gift for her for christmas. Not that I'm a gifter guy (that's a stupid strategy that I would never go down, you cannot ever guilt a woman with gifts!) but there are very rare exceptions where you have an idea that's just so perfect, and so personal and life-changing (for her), that you just can't not do it. This is one of those exceptions. I vetting the idea by a female friend of mine, and she said to go for it and that the gift idea was "better than all the diamond rings in the world". But the best part is that given the nature of the gift I can absolutely do it "as a friend" without any unusual suspicion. Boyfriend or no boyfriend, I don't give a shit, I'm doing what I want. And even if it doesn't make a difference to my life (almost certainly not) I sure know it will make a difference to hers. Yes I agree that they want those three things and that they're not into alpha jerks, but they do want a strong, confident, successful and take-charge kind of guy (even if the femenists won't admit it). I don't see that aspect of female psychology going away any time soon. I think he means exactly what he says  This has been my experience too Yeah, yeah, I know... "Picked a husband"... F*ck that's what I'm scared of! I hope not  I'm 28, she's 31. The BF doesn't seem that macho, and certainly not wealthy. I'm pretty sure I have significantly more cash than this guy, probably by at least a factor of 10. She's a girl at work.I feel petty comparing myself in this way though, as he seems to be a nice guy, but these are still the facts. I'm going to try! I like the first paragraph - a strong man would be able to still pursue her in one thread, while using another to find a single woman. I may see to what extent I can do this while maintaining my dignity and integrity.The second paragraph isn't really my style though for girls that I'm really serious about. I'm not looking for just a fling with this girl. Nope, it's not about sex at all. It's about her being adorable and me wanting to be around her all the time. I wish I could talk to her anytime I wanted, it realy sucks that I can't do that.Yes I agree 1 month is not a relationship, but 1 month could become several months quite easily. True, there's always another one, I know. I guess you just have to trust me that this one is special though. I don't think I've ever been more attracted to a woman before.Agreed. And that absolutely is the my dot plan file 
lolHmm I've never been a stalker to anyone... usually women stalk me though haha.Hmm... I thought about that, but it's a crappy line. It would be better to just drop "that XXXXX is a lucky guy" at some point just to let her know I'm interested. But beyond that that's proly about it.lol when I was first into bitcoin I practically forgot girls existed. I was really obsessed.You're right on that last point. I try not to think about her but it is painful.Yes, practice is good. Many of my men friends need more of that. I'm not an expert but I'm pretty good with women, aside from a few stupid impulsive mistakes that I always regret. The big key for me was having a mentor when I was in Las Vegas and going around meeting many, many women with him. Damn, I miss those days...The problem is, the other guy isn't an asshole. I wish he was though, it would make things much easier.I think I'm pretty much screwed. This girl is very cool. A singer in a band for one thing.Yeah I'm 28. So I do want to go have fun, but I donno I'm finally reaching an age where that doesn't cut it anymore. I had plenty of fun in Vegas, but I'm tired of young women with no morals and always worried they could have VD hahaI think that hits the nail on the head, we do share a special friendship bond that she doesn't have with anyone else.Hmm yeah I've rarely if ever had to really actively pursue a woman, every relationship I've been in has just been an organic process.Damn, you're right about the "want what they can't have" bit. But that's digging into female psychology, where they're attracted to high-status/high-confidence men. 90% of my single male friends I can tell you don't have girlfriends because they don't give off enough of a confidence vibe (that or they have too much arrogance about being smart and are not socially savvy enough). They've been together one month, so that's the good news for now.Tks for the advice Hey, I like that. Keep it organic Exactly my thoughts. I'm just waiting for the buffalo in the field to show signs of weakness, and then I'll pounce. That occurred to me as well lol! But I just met her a few weeks ago. Damn, if I had met her two months ago then I might have had a shot. Wow, all such great advice: fold, kill the guy, or kill the girl. I'm thinking the best approach is to treat it like a background thread... drop some hints and monitor the situation, but generally speaking try not to bet on it and so keep on the lookout for something new.It's easier said than done though... this one's a keeper. Dammit, this sucks monkey f*ck. It sucks, any advice? Agreed. I don't really even care about restitution at this point. It would be nice but the main thing is to get Trendon in jail for the longest possible amount of time.If this doesn't happen, he *will* move on to hurt more people. He's already blowing the money from what I hear and so IMO will broke again in a few years. I realize the info is proly around, but no time to find it - can someone tell me exactly how much bitcoinmax had in total in btcst at the time pirate shut down? I've heard it was around 120K BTC. I was just following the coins from the deposit addresses. They move in a very bizarre manner, not like normal transactions, but more like deliberate laundering. Basically, one address moves coins sequentially from one address to another (very rapidly, looks scripted), and after each hop a very tiny amount of coins is split off into another address. After hundreds of hops it finally gets to the point where the coins reach 0 and a "leaf" is found. Then all of the tiny addresses recombine later into large accounts.Here are some of the stashes, you can follow your nose from input addresses to reach these points:This one has 40K BTC in it:https://blockchain.info/address/1BqcwhKevdBKeos72b8E32Swjrp4iDVnjPAnother big one with about 7K BTC, coins are still moving (it's ALIVE!):https://blockchain.info/address/1NuTLFADAHJZqUQ9ogAqroCzDhsGjV5vyEAgain, inputs from BTCST can be directly traced here, and the path definitely does not look like a series of "natural" transactions, but definitely deliberate laundering. Walk the chain yourself, it's boring but you'll see what I mean pretty quick.I guess we can't be 100% certain though I suppose, so I apologize if saying that was too hasty, but honestly what's the point of a scam if there's no profit? He's got something (although certainly not 500K lol). It's just common sense. Bah, I'm busy with moving on with my life right now. But I should give up the info:Basically I had a long chat with his last employer, who is a great guy but flat out told me that Trendon is a total con man. He stole money from the company (The Lending Partners) in a wide variety of ways. He headed up IT there and routed orders through his "personal" account, which was just a trick for him to skim off the top of all the orders. Eventually he started charging pirated software, and then ultimately just made up reams of fake orders to steal directly from the company. He ended up stealing tens of thousands before they figured it all out. Unfortunately, before they figured it out, he had also borrowed about 13K from the company's owner (apparently he was very convincing, and sometimes did bizarre "random acts of kindness" and was "charming" when necessary), and when he finally threatened Trendon with legal action Trendon just told him that he was planning on declaring bankruptcy and that he had no assets - so they dropped the case.The guy is a compulsive liar with a massive fantasy-based ego as well. Before they fired him, they noticed he would say all kinds of bullshit like that he went to MIT for a year (fake), he was a pool hustler (he could barely play), an amazing blackjack player (barely knew anything), as basketball superstar (could barely play) etc, etc. It got to the point where he lied so much that everyone in the office thought it was almost funny: they'd say "what'd Trendon make up this week?"He even asked the owner for 2 million at one point, telling him he could turn it into 3 million in ~one week~ - but he wouldn't tell him any details, including who it would go to or anything! When I told him about btcst and what is going on, he said not only was he not surprised, but he said along the lines of "this was where it had to go because he just can't help himself, he has to feed his ego. He's a con man, it's who he is." He called the delays/excuses "classic Trendon" and said he pulled the exact same shit when he was asked to repay the company.I suppose a die-hard would say my conversation is not 100% proof that btcst was a scam, but after hearing this character reference from a trustworthy source, combined with everything else that has happened, I'd say the chances of him repaying are about as likely as me jumping 10 stories high (hey, Trendon can do it! really!)Too bad they didn't get him the first time. It would have saved a lot of people a lot of pain and loss. Okay, I recreated a place to store all our junk:https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B6JGQZNTnC2geDRuREM2bE8zQlU/edit We have to be careful. I'm not certain that the SEC has good intentions or not. So I regret to say that this may not be the best approach. Agreed. I'm going to put the google docs back up and add all the new info to it. He has at least 50k btc in his possession, I know that with near certainty. Before he even started. It was premeditated. Correct, it's absolutely scorched earth time. You won't believe some of the crap I found out about Trendon. He has no intentions of paying anything back. As far as I know, there weren't even any clients, no "system", no nothing - all just fabrications.bitlane, you should call me Guys, it was a scam from day one. I've got all the confirmation I need on this. I'll be posting a larger update soon. Sorry this isn't up to my usual prose and totally lacking details/info, but I'm rushed tonight and need sleep... yes, I made the call. BTW thank you Bruno and BCB for talking with me today, it was a great help. I will write up a more detailed update on the trendon/pirate situation sometime this week so that everyone knows what's going on. There's no longer any reason for me to hide what I'm doing, which means the information I've gathered will go back into the public sphere soon. It will be very useful to re-establish a central repository and official information update thread to keep track of everything.The information I've gathered recently on Trendon is very, very bad. In short: btcst was definitely a scam from day one, and everything that Trendon has ever said has been a lie. Not only that, but btcst is just one of many scams and thefts that Trendon has been involved with in his lifetime. Amazingly he got away from his last major theft (prior to btcst) without prosecution, for many of the same reasons that everyone is now sitting on their hands (he made himself judgement proof while "stringing along" his victims for many months).He's not a normal guy either: everything that I've learned about his past (and present) fits perfectly into psychopathic personality disorder, especially with the way he put his real identity right on the face of his ponzi, including the Las Vegas dinner (hint: it's all an ego thing).The last I heard from the SEC lawyer looking into the case is that they wanted to get a warrant on Trendon, but do not yet have enough information to get one, so we should figure out exactly what information they need to get a warrant and work with the bitcoin community to provide that information to them ASAP. BCB and I already talked and he'll probably be the go-between here between the community, myself, and the SEC.I also know with near certainty that Trendon has at least 10% of the outstanding coins at his disposal (probably more), but don't hold your breath on getting any coins back at all. Civil court is a total waste of time, so stop even thinking about it: these types of people usually hold out until the bitter end. From what the SEC has said, their intentions are to use coin repayment as a means to bargain against a criminal sentence, which I'm certain is the only possible way any coins can be retrieved. So it's very important that we gather up accurate information about who is owed what to provide to the SEC so that whatever % is recovered can go out equitably.Let me know if you have any questions. You can expect a stickied thread from me later in the week as well as the re-emergence of a defined plan of action, all involved parties and info, real communication to and from the SEC, a central repository for everything, and more.-BrightAnarchist An ~evil~ petting zoo?

So I've been using Mercurial and Bitbucket for a lot of my development, but I don't know if I trust bitbucket to not steal my source code. Given that, I was wondering: is there a good site similar to bitbucket that acts as a source control server, yet will store everything in an encrypted manner s.t. only I can access it (i.e. even the people operating the server cannot read the source)?My thinking is that I should just establish my own local mercurial setup, and then regularly PGP up the full directory and backup the PGP file. It's probably the only way to accomplish what I want. Nice, this is great stuff. Thanks.  Fizzgig, you think they're ever going to finish Power of the Dark Crystal?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWVaTX_OzBs http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHqvsosSfr0 +1 Tangible, this guy is on my personal list of the most trustworthy people in bitcoin All the world's a scam,And all the men and women merely suckers,Who strut and fret their coins about the forum,To be heard from no more.It is a tale told by bitlane,Full of fud and trolling,Signifying nothing. Agreed. Exactly what I've been saying. ActualyLy, PM theymos. I already sent mage a PM about this a while back with no response. Witnessed. Oh, and here are the top people that I DIStrust, as a result of either being scammed or blackmailed:cypherdocR-mybitcoin operators PatrickHarnettKlugeFreeMoneyDeathAndTaxesMaged The more the price drops, the happier I get!Why? More cheap coins, of course...FYI I am on record calling for $1 coins again eventually, as loony as it makes me sound LOL What is it about guys that like computers/technology also liking Asian women?Don't tell me you haven't noticed a correlation... My God piotr_n... before insulting me, did it ever occur to you that *I DO NOT OWN ANY TYGRR.BOND-P SHARES AT ALL*?? Although I'm also leaning towards this hypothesis, I don't know for sure that Matt is an insider - but if he is an insider, then I for one believe that he has good intentions with this bet. I simply don't think that pure insider trading represents the type of person that Matt is, and so I choose to trust him, as he has never given me a reason not to. Cool, good to see someone else also vote for "I have no clue." Btw, just the bassline now:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6tp2c6nMMLegendary! Yes, Goat has done well for himself  I think the right move is to wait until september 10th. If things are not made clear by then, then that is the time for us to think about some sort of collective legal action. Until then, however, there is still a very high chance of a reasonable settlement being reached and agreed upon. So: wait. Reposting from another thread: Actually, he said he would be providing that information *yesterday*, right? That was clearly a lie. Jesus, I hate this lawyer crap. So it's friday... are "those details available" now?
 LOL you're a funny guy  Oh man, thanks bitlane! I needed a good laugh  If Matt wins, I will pay him every last satoshi of my bet. To not do this would go against my word and honor.Additionally, he is providing a great service by allowing people to hedge their situation. Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love: hard and fast I think that thread's just a joke haha.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp6-wG5LLqEWhile listening to the awesome song, please take a moment to answer the poleAs for me, I answered "I have no clue" I think involving lawyers in this is just throwing good money after bad. Agreed.At this point, even if he does pay something, his lack of communication has hurt a lot of people. Yes, I distinctly remember him saying exactly this. Yeah, just saw it, here's the full announcement:[17:55] <@pirateat40> As much as I've tried to meet the deadlines within the community, there're conditions beyond my control which have escalated the process to the point it is today.[17:55] <@pirateat40> Bitcoin Savings & Trust has hereby given notice of default to it's account holders.[17:57] <@pirateat40> No timeline or further information is available at this time. I posted this before:Hashing to defendA network of truth that guardsLiberty my love. No, he's the one to the left of Goat, with the black hat on.  YES! We want Steve! We want Steve! Yeah, I'm getting deja vu here... LOL sorry Mushroomized, I gotta admit that's funny... but only because I'm already paid back. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMM_(Ponzi_scheme_company) lol
Haha Dank is just there for the Lolz  Tks, where would he go in the list though? Trying to put them in order of fame (if it's even possible ) Add some names w/ links and I'll add 'em here! Also, lets get the order right in terms of fame (subjective, I know) - so let me know not just the name, but where to put 'em in the list.Satoshi NakamotoGavin AndresonTrendon Shavers aka Pirateat40Dread Pirate RobertsMatthew N. WrightZhou TongJon MatonisAnd of course most importantly: Dank! Exaaaaactly! So few people get this... I really hope Obama wins so he can take the blame.Good ol' sheeple, they always blame the figurehead, no matter what they actually do or don't do. very catchy... Nah he was waiting for the price to crash first  I would too, but if I'm lucky and my count in the OP is accurate, than we should ultimately see more panic here than we did during the wave A decline from $32 to $2. A waves are generally coupled with a psychological backdrop of disappointment and surprise whereas C waves are when outright fear takes hold. If it does unfold in this manner, I hope to be buying like crazy at the bottom.But... we'll just have to wait and see what happens I guess. There is no crystal ball, only probabilities. Correct. The retracement went a bit higher than I expected, but I think being within 3 days of a major top is pretty damn close . $12.16 would be the first fib resistance point about 38% whereas $15.40 is about 50% which is the next major resistance point.I think it's likely that Wave B is over and Wave C of II has begun to the downside. As I said in the OP, I'm still holding long with the coins that I already have, but I'm not buying any more coins until they reach around the $2 level again (unless my outlook changes).Today's action certainly looks more like a major reversal rather than YANC (yet another normal correction): bitlane: Why would you want to bite the hand that feed you? What trades?I am long BTC without a stop and believe the B wave potential is still on the table and may present a buying opportunity in the future. I've said this several times already. This.Thanks for posting something intelligent, in contrast to all the snickering posters who don't understand enough wave theory to comprehend the nature of the idea, or the specific fact that I said it's a potential wave count with some real merit to it and not even remotely meant to be an exact forecast, especially in the short-term.Again:I've lost some respect for some of the other commenters. You must have mild OCD just like me, because I've done similar things before So basically, people are profiting from your irrational psychology, whereby you setup a cold storage wallet and have a strong emotional need to keep it "pristine", yet at the same time want to profit from loaning out the funds.Of course, ideally you should first prove the account ownership and balance total by signing a message with your private key before taking deposits. Yeah, and of course the bearish case is actually bullish anyway... it all depends on the time frame!That's why I said I'm long no matter what, but if we do get a nice drop to these cheap levels, I'm buying way more coinzzzzzzzzzzz  I haven't really investigated the bullish case, but here's the bearish case in better detail:Wave I is the impulse to the bubble high of $32. It has a 4th wave in the 50 cent to $1 area.Wave II is where we may be now.Wave A of Wave II was the "crash" down to $2, then we began a B wave upSince then we've done an even smaller a-b-c to form the B wave, which should end eventually with a nice lower high, potentially at around $12 (but there's a wide range here, I'm just making a guess based on volume).So next would be Wave C down to end the larger Wave II. Then at around $1 we begin the giant Wave III to the moon (i.e. past $100/coin probably). Volume has been decreasing on each major move since mid-July$12.16 is ~38% of the move to the all-time high, a Fibonacci resistance levelWe could be ending a C-wave move of an a-b-c countertrend that began at the $2 low (which itself is a B wave, making the "crash" the A wave and the C wave yet to come)The stability around $5 resembles more a sideways B-wave than a deep 2nd wave retracement prior to a large impulse moveOn a logarithmic chart, the $2 low was still not within the 4-th wave area of the 5-wave bubble move to $32. This 4-th wave area is between 50 cents and $1.I of course have no crystal ball, and the super-bullish scenario is also possible where we're starting a 3-of-3 up to past $32. But - if there's a bearish case to be made, then here it is, and here's me hoping for a buying opportunity in the future.Either way, I'm long BTC, but if it gets to the $1 level, I'm buying even more with both hands. Fundamentals are the biggest reason to be bullish, especially with Silk Road growing like it has, so I'm quite curious so see how the next few months unfold.Log Chart:http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#ig6-hourztgOzm1g10zm2g25zcvzlDiscuss.   True, but I will never trade with him again. I think another interesting ratio is # ounces gold / # btcWhich is 5,079,817,925 / 21,000,000 ~= 241That is, BTC should be worth 241 ounces of gold if we assume parity in terms of utility.With gold at $1571, that's 241 * $1571 ~= $378K per BTCand with bitcoin at $11.42, if we went to $378K, that would be a gain of 33,000 times your investment, or about a 3 million percent gain.LOL  I don't think rising prices has any affect on pirate, except for a giant super-short-term move which is unlikely. He is just having fun by talking this way with you guys. I do, however, believe that he'll be able to pay out higher rates for longer if BTC price stays down, since lower prices force him to move less USD around and thus he needs more BTC to keep his volume high.Personally, I feel that BTC may be getting close to a topping point, but I've been wrong before. I'm just watching the SPX and all the hindenburg omens, and although everyone tells me I'm nutz, I cannot help but notice the correlation between BTC prices and general asset prices (stocks, junk bonds, metals). We've been in a rally since June in all this stuff, and so if the correlation holds I'm hoping BTC will fall along with these other assets as we near the late fall/early winter timeframe.Either way, it will be interesting to find out!
I'm in  Over 21 million Yes, and thanks for doing this  Yes, he is, and I am satisfied with the settlement.Thanks. Everyone around me (in meatspace that is, not on the forums) tells me I shouldn't be so reckless by putting so much of my savings into BTC.But really - what are the real risks here? Under what scenario could bitcoin possibly fail? From http://pastebin.com/ZqqFEqkcI don't get it... so Bitcoin lets anybody put any data they want into the blockchain, and we have to haul that data around forever?Is this accurate? Are there any plans to mitigate this issue?Thanks! Thanks guys, but I still don't get it. Can you walk me through it step by step? I thought solving a block was just a guess-and-check, so my thinking is that the "check" step is what takes all the computational resources. So by "checking" two different chains, you're doubling the cost.Obviously I'm wrong, can someone clear up my misunderstanding? Thanks!  Great quote! If your account was hacked, then you'd be glad there was a daily limit... Sorry for being stupid but I don't get how this works. If you choose a noonce and hash it with a block's contents, wouldn't it take longer to do this for a second, third, fourth (etc) blockchain? I know I'm must be missing something simple about how this works... Thanks in advance True, but isn't this a healthy sign? I mean, even in the gold-backed-money days, didn't most people keep their money in a bank which lent it out to earn interest?The great thing about bitcoin, though, is that unlike fiat money, you're aren't forced to lend it or suffer loss of purchasing power. Due to its deflationary nature, with BTC you can take the risk of lending, or you can just hold it directly with essentially zero risk. Everybody wins  Agreed.When "everyone" notices, then that's likely a bubble. When nobody does, then it's an early stage bull market.Just like the h-omens on the spx the other week... nobody mentioned them, so likely the spx wil go down. Whereas the last time we had h-omens, everybody noticed them and they were front page news, so of course the market went up.Funny how that works. Please keep this thread open at least until I am also repaid. Thanks Loan filled, closing. Thanks. How is BLoC going? Do you know when you will launch? 100 BTC already lent to me from Tril, so now I'm only looking for 930 BTC. I updated the OP.Thanks. I need a modestly sized short-term loan.I have great rep. PM if interested.Thanks,BA Thanks, but if we go this route, who owns the bounty and who decides if the feature is implemented to each of our likings?Aso, looks like they take a 5% cut of the bounty. OOooooo!!! Nice! Thanks. Huh, just found these: http://keepyourassets.net/2012/06/27/excellent-bitcoin-radio-interviews/
Does such a thing exist? Like maybe a weekly podcast or something?If someone were to do this, I would gladly pay them some BTC each week to listen in. I'm obsessed with BTC and would love to be able to listen to updates on the bitcoin community while I work. Same here. So far more than 20 coins have been pledged  to the person or persons that implement this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93606 Hopefully more pledges soon... Haha nice way to put it; I feel that way about all fiat. Yes. I think it's the only area of significant economic growth in the world that we'll have for the next 5 years or so. The incentives are just far too great to doing business the bitcoin way. Meanwhile, the fiat economy will crash and burn under the weight of its excessive debt. Haha yeah, it's the typical 1-5-6-4 chord progression, just like every other pop song since the 90s. For the funny  Meh, I'll see what happens. Paypal wouldn't let me cancel the dispute anyway, so I guess in 5 more days I'll know what they're going to do, and then I can just take it from there.I don't think it's worth bothering beyond that for a measly 8 BTC. I mean, I really don't want to discuss digital currency with my CC company or paypal.It's more about the principle of it, which is why a scammer tag is basically the same to me as getting paid back the 8 coins. Either way is fine. It would be totally different if it were something like 100 BTC of course. Nothing is being charged back. I bought 12.5 BTC for $70, but only recieved 4.5 BTC. Therefore I am owed 8 BTC. He does not owe me any USD at all.I'm fine with just giving R- a scammer tag and leaving it at that, unless he wants to send the 8 BTC to me and also the 36 BTC owed to OP. However, I think that outcome is unlikely. Kim Dotcom - Mr Presidenthttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MokNvbiRqCM *Sigh* This whole thing isn't worth the trouble or risk for just 8 BTC, so I just cancelled the dispute.Lesson learned: don't use the gift feature if you're sending first. Or even better: don't ever send first unless it's someone you already trust. He owes me 8 BTC, that is all. I want it to go back to $5 and just stay there for the next year, so I can accumulate more and more coins.And then go to $1 million each after that.That would be the ideal scenario  Yeah, more on this BROKE stuff:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zqp7cuwmPQ Haha actually I really like the slogan... Bitcoin *is* magical...  This scenario seems very believable. It's amazing what gov't will do when they run out of money - just about anything is more politically palatable than cutting off entitlements.Just look at the municipalities that are going bankrupt... they wait until the last minute, and then finally cut all salaries to minimum wage. Funny thing is, the unions are complaining about the pay cuts, but the reality is that few people understand the meaning of BROKE. LOL Huh, ok so I opened up a case of unauthorized transaction, which appears to be the only way to reverse a gift on paypal. If that doesn't go through then I guess I can call my credit card company next.Technically speaking, I bought 12.5 BTC for $70, but only received 4.5 BTC with a promise that he'd send the remaining 8 BTC "ASAP". Since $70 is now roughly the cost of 8 BTC, I believe I am fully justified in refunding the full dollar amount ( which I would use to buy the 8 BTC I am owed, or as close to that amount as possible. ) I tried to, but paypal wouldn't let me because it was marked as a gift. I funded my PP with a credit card though, not sure if this makes a difference. I wish I had saved more of our convos... but this is all I have.Still no coins though. I bought 8 BTC for PPUSD from R- two months ago, and he still hasn't sent me the coins. I can't dispute it via paypal because I marked it "as a gift." He keeps telling me that he's "just transferring the money now..." but never seems to be able to do it. Pretty much the same story as the OP, he just keeps stringing me along.I haven't mentioned it until now because I was believing him, and not thinking I got scammed, but now I'm depressed after reading the OP  and guessing that I probably won't get my money back.I think it's time for a scammer tag for R-
http://www.shtfplan.com/precious-metals/liquidate-iras-and-401ks-or-suffer-grievous-losses_12082010"This means that at some point in the future, when government comes under pressure from debt buyers to raise interest rates in order to offset the risk of a depreciating dollar and potential for default, the interest payments on our debt will rise significantly. Some estimates suggest that 60% of our outgoing payments will eventually be interest  a number so large that it will literally destroy the US economic system as we know it. At some point, our international line of credit (provided by China, Russia, Japan, et. al.) will be cut off."In a last ditch effort to prevent complete financial, economic, political and social collapse, the government, like those in Argentina and Hungary, will move to seize private assets of Americans. Those assets are primarily held in IRA and 401k retirement accounts and they will become the targets of government intervention."   Yep. They definitely exist, but no way that 3 out of the first 10 or so people that clicked on this have that many... Love it. I was happy when it stayed at $5 for many months... those were productive months. Just curious  Why would anyone give you money at the lower rate of 3.5%/week when you're just going to pass it through to pirate? This. Ah hahahha nice  I just buy some coins every month, regsrdless of the price. It's too much stress worrying abousomething you cannot predict, so that's why I'm slowly dollr cost averaging. I'm getting for the long haul with bitcoin, for all of its stated benefits, not for the price potential (although that would be nice too.)Speaking on that point, someone told me that if the illegal drug trade moved to btc exclusively, then each coins would be $15000. I didn't check his math or sources thougl but it sounds believable.(blame my ipad for the typos) Whew, this is a huge relief. This looks interesting. Any chance the charity could be used to pay people to work on core bitcoin? If so, then I may toss in some coin since block-chain compression needs to be addressed. A lot of the questions were misleading...For example, I came across far more economically leftist in this study than I should have. Questions like "is it okay if profit is the only goal for a corporation" and I said no since it depends on how it generates those profits: justly, or unjustly? For example, a cult or MLM scam harms many people even though it's a business in the free market.But just because I think corporations do have social responsibility, it doesn't mean that I think the government needs to be involved. I don't even think corporations should exist as they do now anyway; they're an invention of government. In the end, I basically desire some of the same end-results that a lot of the left wants (good medical care for everyone, etc.), it's just that I believe the only means to get there is through freedom, not big government.  I don't think we need to organize. It's probably best that each person do the donation themselves directly to those that implement the necessary compression features. Otherwise there could be disagreement on how to distribute the pledges, for many reasons...This thread is just to give incentive to solve the blockchain bloat problem. It's up to each individual to follow through on their personal pledges. I really like the concept of ultimate blockchain compression.I don't have the time nor the expertise to contribute code to implement etotheipi's idea, but I do have the coin. I hereby pledge 10 BTC to the person or persons that implement ultimate blockchain compression. With such a scheme in place, I would feel much more secure about Bitcoin's future.If you feel the same way, then lets make this a pledge thread.Addendum 8/21/2012: Ripper has been entrusted to manage a bounty wallet, so send coins here: Just took it and basically got the same score as you, about 2 boxes further to the right. YESS!!! +11111111 I know this is going to sound harsh, but it's amazing to me how ignorant most people are about the nature of good money. I think they don't fully understand money in a theoretical sense: they rarely if ever have questioned the green paper in their pocket, despite the vital role it plays in their life.If they don't get bitcoin after a bit of explaination, that's fine - it just means cheaper coins for us prior to critical mass adoption. No need to bring them up to speed. And for those who do get it and dislike it because of its properties ( because they're keynesians or whatever ), they don't deserve to benefit from it anyway.That said, there are risks with a new technology, but I think it would be silly to not at least buy some coins if you comprehend it's potential. It wasn't long ago that they were 6 cents each and everyone was having fun with this "play money"...As Gavin said: "It's a startup currency, which has never happened before." Great quote. Wow, so you took the full plunge!I haven't yet, but I'm thinking about it. Now that's a prediction!
That was my guess as well, but I've been wrong before. What say you?? I suppose the concept of bills could work, but they'd all be spend-once only (because the acceptor would have to scan it, destroy the bill, and then transfer the coins over to themselves, to ensure you don't defraud them later).If someone could make them spendable multiple times, that would be amazing, but I don't know how this is possible. Unless there was a trusted third party that could do a multi signature on the coins (so that, to redeem a bill, you need to sign it with both the bill's private key and the trusted third party's private key). In this way, the bill could be verified to have the correct balance, and also be spent many times before redemption.However: what would prevent someone from simply duplicating the bill, spend it, and then redeem the copy? Or just spend the same bill mutiple times? So it still doesn't work... There must be a way though because damn, it would be awesome. Fantastic idea. A much needed service for many well established and trustworthy borrowers.The rates would have to be high enough, however, that biz uses it for its intended purpose. Otherwise someone could just borrow to the hilt and arb the interest rate. Protection from litigation is the #1 best feature of bitcoin imo: http://goxxed.blogspot.com/2012/01/real-advantages-of-bitcoin.html Agreed. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9370376/Man-22-who-died-from-dehydration-in-hospital-rang-police-for-a-drink-of-water.html I've actually already done this kind of thing.I had some btc on deposit with a forum member, and transferred that deposit to another forum member.No blockchain involved.I think this kind of thing will become more common as bitcoin banks become more robust. Eventually the bitcoin network will only be used for settlement IMO. speaking of NZD, I carried around a bunch of NZ cash just for fun for nearly a decade, funny thing is that when I finally exchanged it back to USD I had actually made a profit if someone sent me coins that way the first thing i'd do is spend them to another wallet that I know the sender can't have a copy of I just want to make money.Having it stay "underground" is fine by me. It's the linux of currencies. I think a fully alternative decentralized internet is needed in the long run. Tor and freenet are great, but they're built on existing physical infrastructure.A p2p wireless meshnet is what we really need. What about a jump in the price of BTC? Clearly USD-based micro-loans would require the bond value to float. Damn..."You know the internet kill switch given to Obama at the start of his Presidency, this is part of that infrastructure. On Monday they are testing it, or rather I should write "arming" it."http://www.iberianet.com/forum/false-flag-alert---important---internet-kill/article_9033dfe2-c986-11e1-98f7-001a4bcf887a.html Speaking of this, Kluge is also very trustworthy. Omg hahaha, poor scammer bruce... Do you know this for certain? Because if so, he ran off with 2K BTC of my funds. Very nice! I'm going to have to upgrade my password of course. If he was really the guy who ran MyBitcoin.com, then I want his head on a platter Meh, I'm no good at trading BTC/USD, so I guess the rally is meaningless to me. I'll just keep calmly dollar-cost averaging into BTC over time.
"If you plan to invest more than 50000 USD or equivalent on the long term in bitcoins, we need to know about you. In this case please use our verification system to get your account verified first."Hmm... not sure if using mtgox is a good idea. This is a really good point, I agree. Is it just me, or is the recent breakout above $7 a sign that we may be making new all time highs next year? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated, thanks. I bet a bunch of those 10K addresses belong to the same person What kind of volume can you do? I might want to buy 1K USD worth on Friday. This is true.I know it sounds melodramatic, but in all honesty Bitcoin is keeping me alive right now.I broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years, and have since developed an extreme chronic pain disease. I am forced to work less hours and spend almost all my time doing treatment.Thankfully, my various Bitcoin endevours are making huge amounts of money, which has made up for my lack of ability to work, plus the potential for bitcoin to liberate the world keeps me emotionally charged. Until I fully recover, this forum is basically my social life. It's sad, but it's saving me at the darkest time in my entire life.I'm still alive though and I'm going to beat this thing. I have a lot more sympathy now for people who are truely suffering, but at the same time, I have lot less sympathy for those who are just "depressed" but without a severe health ailment of any kind. You don't realize that just sitting in a chair outside on a sunny day and not having physical pain is as good as it gets on this earth. Appreciate what you have and how blessed you are to have your health, and never forget it. Agreed, +1 for patrick This is stupid in so many ways.First of all, it was stupid of him to burn down his house.Secondly, 20 years in prison benefits no-one. Rather, it would punish innocent people by forcing them to pay tax money to keep him there, as well as ruin his life. Wouldn't it make infinitely more sense for everyone involved to allow him to remain semi-free in society, but required to pay down the damage he had done over the rest of his lifetime?The way the "justice" system works under government is so horrid it's unbelievable. Given the situation, however, I do not believe that taking cyanide was irrational ( when the alternative is to most likely remain in a rape cage until you die... ) I've been using various services in the past to mix coins, but they're expensive ( 2% on average ).Any ideas on a secure and cheap way to achieve the same thing? Thanks! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xXVhmu0SS8 I agree provided it's optional. Generally speaking PGP does the job for me. I aways give my public key and notify my various account holders to only allow me to withdraw upon recieving a signed request. Bringing back up an old thread... but time is taking its toll. I now am nearing the point where a very large % of my liquid assets are now in BTC. I didn't plan it this way exactly; it just happened. Probably because I'm a BTC addict and cannot stop buying them.I guess at this point for diversity's sake I probably shouldn't keep buying them ( although it's hard not to ) and maintain my ol' stash of shitty treasury bills earning their 0.000000000000001% interest... Hey interesting responses, but I never said I knew what Pirate was doing. I just said there's someone else here in the forum who told me that they know what he's doing and are planning to compete ( other than the OP ). I would definitely buy this ETF I know someone else on the forum with deep pockets that also plans to compete with pirate.It's not me though; I have my own very different btc-business going on.But I'm just saying you're not the only one who claims to have it figured out. Cool, thanks 4 the link Arbitration. stephen molyneux calls them DROs for dispute resolution organizations I agree, just read my blog post about this  here. Basically, everyone only does serious business with people that all have contracts with reputable arb firms. Then the arb firms contract between themselves. If you disagree with your arb firm's decision, then you're effectively blacklisted.Law and order, without force or government. Very good vid. I don't like their "solutions" much though.
Thanks for sharing this, it's a really entertaining read! +1... we need MORE attack pieces!The more they hate... the better deals I get when I buy That's a good idea, I'll have to try that.No, I have a checking account with jpmorgan chase, but the closest bank to me was us bank. https://www.facebook.com/CryptoAnarchism Oh also I wanted to ACH out of the account to buy BTC that way, but they won't allow that either due to brokerage account regulations. I'd have to setup a second bank account with another firm, ACH to that account, and then ACH to an outside account.Again, WTF?The more I use btc, the more and more I'm hating legacy banks. They just plain suck. So I went to withdraw 3K from a local bank today ( not my bank, but a local one ). The request was denied with no information.So I called my account manager and it turns out my account has a 2.499K daily limit that I cannot lift. So I wanted to try again, but the local bank said that "we cannot do it a second time today. If it doesn't go through the first time, we have a policy that we cannot try again in a single day." Um... but you have my ID, my account manager is on the phone, etc.... and of course, the entire process wasted 45 minutes of my time.WTF?So now my Bitcoin contact is arriving on Saturday, and I don't have the cash, so now I have to wait another freaking week to buy BTC.I. Hate. Banks. Although I won't put any money in or use it, I still support the OP's initiative. If a demand exists for this kind of thing, then there's nothing wrong with an "inflatacoin" at all - just as long as nobody is forced to use it. That's what's great about a truly free market: anything goooooessssssss! Thanks, changing status to "FILLED" PM me if interested. I am very trustworthy.Thanks,BA  'cause Bitcoin is way cool.Also, it cured my apathy. Erik Voorhees's article is more powerful when read out loudhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAm3satFHD8 Loan filled, thanks! PM me if interested. I've got plenty of rep.Thanks,BA Agreed.BTW I recommend listening to Stef's opinion on BTC, it really clarifies the whole "backing is neccessary" misconception:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_VewfiuCao The mainstream financial system is a messhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTN7hL5fgWoGlad I don't Have to care about it anymore PM me to do a small deal, I need a small purchase made from a European credit card. I can repay in Bitcoins with a commission for your help. Yep! Whoever you are, thanks for the 5 bitcents! Ah yes, that's what I meant.
Maybe true, but it's not worth it to me to borrow at a lower rate for a one month period. PM me if interestedI have a great reputationThanks listening... very good ideas here, similar to my balance chain concept  but much more fleshed out http://blog.ml-implode.com/2012/06/ml-implode-gets-wikileaks-treatment-as-wells-fargo-freezes-closes-business-account/ PM me if you're interested in buying this. ( I'm switching my main lappy over to linux. )Obviously, it's a non-OEM copy ( i.e. retail ), so you can use it on any computer.Looking for $200 worth of BTC ( which is $20 less than what MSFT sells it for ).I can ship it to you on a DVD, or I can just send you an ISO of the DVD via skype or something along with the CD key. My wallet has over a million satoshis! Nope, piano and guitar. My friend does the drums I feel like sharing some of my music as well http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6aG3fuFsCA Nice! A lot of talent there I've already donated to Zimmerman but I'd be happy to donate moreJust PM me with how much you want to donate and we can make a deal. This allows me to buy more btc anyway. I can send you a copy of my reciept etc after I make the paypal donation. I think you'll be fine.If you do lose some funds, I can do you one better: I lost 2K BTC when mybitcoin.com was "hacked"... that was during the bubble too when the account was worth around 70K USD. subscribing for entertainmentbut seriously I hope this gets resolved well Bump - moved the price up to 5.80EDIT - closed again Symptoms include, but not limited to:- Severe addition to buying bitcoins, the more interesting a method used the better- Constant checking of forums for new updates, to the point where it affects work and relationships- Only wanting to hang out with other bitcoiners- Wearing bitcoin T-shirts and decorating your car with bitcoin bumper stickers- Little understanding as to why others don't "get it" and use bitcoin- Only drink out of a bitcoin mug- First thing you do in the morning is check bitcoinwatch.com, and then head to the forums- Wonder why anyone cares about the value of your state currency anymore- Plan out how you will spend your billions when bitcoin becomes mainstream- Talk about bitcoin so much that your friends and family know you as "that guy who's obsessed with bitcoin"- Believe real world women should be impressed that you are able to make money "on the dark web"Where will this condition lead?? Is there a cure?? Nty, it is not their fault - they had an account frozen that they were using to buy coins ( I'm guessing they were arbing the fact that I'm paying above the spot price ).Regardless, as a buyer I only want to buy from people who already have the coins on hand before I do the trade. It keeps things fast.   Need 100 coins @ 5.60, please PM with your paypal address. Only PM if you want to sell the full 100 coins.This time though, you have to send first. Sorry, but I've had way too many people who have taken several hours to deliver the coins, whereas when I trade I want to do it *fast* ( in fact, one person still hasn't delivered the coins after a full week's time ).Thanks!BA This pisses me off. Really, I mean really?? I thought LinkedIn was supposed to be professional. Every newb knows that you always want some salt with your hash ( and maybe some eggs too ). Otherwise it's bland and tasteless. I've been buying btc with paypal for a while, but today I got a phone call from a pypal rep asking about "suspicious behavior" in my account.I guess they don't like you sending lots of cash gifts to random people either. Thanks! Closing thread again. Bump - buying again. I need 100 BTC. I would like to just do a single trade, so don't PM me unless you have 100 to sell. Please include your PayPal address so we don't have to do a lot of back and forth. Thanks!
+1 to Immuzikation, thanks for being accommodating  We need DROs ( Dispute Resolution Organizations ) in the Bitcoin world.

I love this forum  BTW mag arrived in Vegas today wooohhooooo! Sooo jelly!Still waiting... Hey thanks for the feedback, I am learning a lot more about Bitcoin just by thinking about this stuff ( and realizing how little I really understand! ).Ideally yes a test altchain is the way to go. +1 grue+1 Kluge+1 Maged+1 OgNasty+1 zhoutong+1 TangibleCryptographyGreat dealings and transactions with all of the above! I'm going to plug my proposal on how to drastically shrink the blockchain:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=83645.0 Hmm the more I think about this the more I think it could work.In reality, you only need to store the most recent balance block and subsequent transaction blocks. As long as you have block headers for all previous balance blocks, you can be assured that noone can cheaply spoof a fake balance chain due to the high cost of each proof of work. You wouldn't even need old transaction block headers, and you could easily bootstrap a new node just by sending them (1) the balance block headers (2) the most recent balance block (3) all transaction blocks that occurred after the most recent balance block.This would cut storage requirements massively.I just need to find some free time so I can code this up Nice thanks, I'll take a read. Seconded True, it should be tested as an alt-chain. Maybe "rollcoin" or something.I'm sure there are a million problems with this approach that just aren't immediately apparent FYI I made a few edits to the OP ( using strikethrough ) based on the suggestions made thus far Why would the balance chain need to be shared on the network? It can easily be computed using the transaction chain, since each balance block specifically covers "up to" a certain transaction block. Only the nonce values would have to be shared on the network for the balance blocks. Here is what I propose:Every block in the block chain only pays out 90% 99.9% of its block reward. The other 10% 0.1% is kept on reserve in the block.A second "balance" chain is created, which consists of transaction chain blocks hashed in a tree along with the usual nonce and a hash of the previous balance chain block.Each balance chain block holds the balance of every non-empty bitcoin address up to the point of the last transaction block included.The balance chain difficulty is 100X 1000X the transaction chain difficulty.The node that solves a balance chain block recieves all of the reserved block rewards from the included transaction blocks.In this manner, over time old transaction blocks can be forgotten since the most recent balance block plus the most recent transaction blocks are all that are needed to verify transactions. To keep the integrity of the network, of course, more history should be saved, but we probablly don't need more than a few thousand balance blocks while still being very secure.In this manner, the only data required for each full node would be: (1) block headers for all balance blocks (2) the most recent balance block (3) transaction blocks that occurred after the most recent balance block.Do you think this scheme could work? I'm not even remotely an expert on this stuff, so forgive any glaring errors. Thanks! We will. I'm just not quite well enough yet to go out. Dealing with my myofascial pain problem is a bitch, but I'm slowly getting better every month w/ physical therapy. This. True.BTW just realized than denominatons of 10K BTC could be called "pizzas"  I am ready to order more copies if I like this first one... I plan to "accidentally" leave them all over Las Vegas, whereever magazines are to be found ( hair salons, doctor's offices, etc. ) WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOI can't wait until I get mine!! Jealous... 
Are you planning on issuing more shares anytime soon? Thanks. Thanks mate, I added it to my blog.No worries about derailing; I'm finished buying so I marked the thread as "closed"... for now  Awesome, it's good to see some really successful btc business going on, even if we don't know what it is. It helps stabalize the currency because it ensures demand. Hey thanks for the kind words! I also enjoy doing business with the three of you, and hope for much more in the future.This is why I don't understand why some sell out their reputations just to rip off a few BTC... it's something primitive, a lack of foresight and short-term greed. Honesty is not just moral, it's also far more profitable in the long run, as I'm sure everyone who does business in BTC has realized. Trust opens up doors and makes business go quickly and smoothy.Hmm, that gives me an idea for a new blog post as well... without laws/government, the threat of ostracization really acts well as a natural "governance" structure over BTC business. Are you a mining company who will utilize the funds directly, or are you using the proceeds to purchase other mining bonds?Also, when is the IPO ( or did I already miss it )?Thanks.

Correct on all points. That is why I love the Roth IRA, especially with the new loopholes that let you put 55K/year into it by rolling from a SEP IRA into a Traditional, and then into a Roth.However, that said - when was the last time the government kept a promise? I have doubts that the dollar is even going to be worth much of anything 40 years from now when I start drawing on my nest egg, or that the government won't decide to "dip in" to those tastey retirement accounts when it is hungry for more tax base as the economy continues to deteriorate.Just look at what happened to the original idea of SS with the SS "trust" fund. Didn't take long for politicians to bleed it dry and turn it into the ponzi scheme that it is today.Making a deal with the government is like making a deal with a devil. Sure, you'll save taxes, trust us... but we can change the rules however we wish as we go along... Right, this is my sense as well: peak government. Many people much smarter than me have postulated that the end of the US as a superpower is neigh. And if we get a monetary reboot, whether through hyper-deflation or hyper-inflation ( or both in that order, at least that I what I am expecting ), then who knows what could happen.Honestly I trust Bitcoin more than the dollar in many ways, mainly the fact that it's a real asset that is not someone else's liability ( or in someone else's control ). Also, I have been sued before, and I don't want to have to worry about my assets being taken by lawyers; I have read too many horror stories. I am also short Note that I don't mean Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA -- I've already decided Roth is better.I mean Roth IRA vs Bitcoin.What say you?Right now I'm in both to diversify. The more time that passes, however, the more confidence I gain and the more % of my assets I move into Bitcoin. But I haven't cracked my IRA at all to buy BTC, but sometimes I wonder why I have it if the government may decide to confiscate it some day anyway ( hey, Argentina has done it, as well as many other countries that got into financial problems... ) Not yet awesome stuff, if I actually make any money I'll have to tip you guys for the helpthanks Hmm, don't see an API listed on their page though Awesome, awesome! That's perfect, thanks for the info. Only needs to be enough volume to make more than $5/month lol See, this is why bitscalper had to be a scamOther than cross-exchange arbitrage, any single exchange trader is going to get killed with these kind of commission rates. awesome, thanks for all the info, this is great dataAlso - anyone know if it's possible to get commissions down to a reasonable level on any exchanges for automated trading?The gox rate of 0.60% is way too high for what I'm doing ( it would eat all the profit and then some from each trade ).If I can get the commission down to 0.1% or below then I can make money. I guess I should PM the exchanges and see if they'll make an exception for someone who makes the market ( provides liquidity ) exclusively and who trades frequently. Anyone know where I can find this?Thanks,BA "Law enforcement cannot target one central location or company for investigative purposes or to shut down the system."That's the whole point!  watching watching If they do it in Vegas again I'll go, but I can't do it this yearToo bad because I live adjacent to the Red Rock Thanks for implementing this much needed serviceI may use this in the future Watching This explains the problem fairly well regarding central banking and bailout policies...http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204903804577082533052728286.htmlChristmas Trees and the Logic of GrowthThe ubiquitous greenery of the season has me thinking conifers and stock market crashes. There is much to be learned from the coned evergreen trees that form vast forests across the Northern Hemisphere. As the oldest trees on the planet, the mighty conifers have survived threats of catastrophic extinction since the time of the hungry herbivorous dinosaurs.The conifer's secret to longevity lies in a paradox: Their conquest has been largely the result of episodes of massive forest destruction. When virtually all else is gone, conifers show their strength and prowess as nature's opportunists. How? They have adapted to evade competitors by out-surviving them and then occupying their real estate after catastrophic fires.First, the conifer takes root where no one else will go (think cold, short growing seasons and rocky, nutrient-poor soil). Here, they find the time, space and much-needed sunlight to thrive early on and build their defenses (such as height, canopy and thick bark). When fire hits, those hardy few conifers that survive can throw their seeds onto newly cleared, sunlit and nutrient-released space. For them, fire is not foe but friend. In fact, the seed-loaded cones of many conifers open only in extreme heat.This is nature's model: overgrowth, followed by destruction of the overgrowth, and then the subsequent new growth of the healthiest and most robust, which ultimately leaves the forest and the entire ecosystem better off than they were before.Pondering these trees, it is not too much of a stretch to consider the financial forests of our own making, where excess credit and malinvestment thrive for a time, only to be destroyedand then the releasing of capital into markets where competition has been wiped out. The Austrian school economists understood this well, basing a whole theory around this investment cycle.After the purge, great investment opportunities are created, from which prolific periods of growth emanateprovided that sufficient capital remains to reinvest into the fertile and now-open landscape. Suppressing fire, creating the illusion of fire protection, leads to the wrong kind of growth, which then invites greater destruction. About 100 years ago, the U.S. Forest Service took a zero-tolerance approach to forest fires, stamping them out at the first blaze. Fast forward to 1988 when a massive wildfire at Yellowstone National Park wiped out more than 30 times the acreage of any previously recorded fire.What obviously occurred was that the most fire-susceptible plants had been given repeated reprieves (bailouts, in a sense), and they naturally accumulated, along with the old, deadwood of the forests. This made for a highly flammable fuel load because when fires are suppressed the density of foliage is raised, particularly the most fire-prone foliage. The way this foliage connects the grid of the forest, as it were, has come to be known as the "Yellowstone Effect."A far better way to prevent massively destructive fires is by letting the fires burn. Human intervention in nature's cycles by suppressing fires destroys the system's natural homeostatic forces.Strangely parallel to the Yellowstone catastrophe was the start of the federal government's other fire-suppression policy with the 1984 Continental Illinois "too big to fail" bank bailout. This was followed by Alan Greenspan's pronouncement immediately after the 1987 stock market crash that the Federal Reserve stood by with "readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economy and financial system," which heralded the birth of the "Greenspan put." The Fed would no longer tolerate fires of any size.From a forestry point of view, the lessons were learned. In 1995, the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy stated, "Science has changed the way we think about wildland fire and the way we manage it. Wildland fire, as a critical natural process, must be reintroduced into the ecosystem." Herein are pearls of great wisdom for central bankers today. Central banks are creating a tinderbox by keeping alive many very bad investments, fertilizing them with everything from artificially low interest rates to preferential liquidity to outright securities purchases. As these institutions and instruments overrun the financial landscape, they hamper the economic ecosystem and perpetuate the environment of low growth and high unemployment in which we currently find ourselves.Seeing periodic, naturally occurring catastrophes as part of the growth cycle requires thinking more than one step ahead, not only longer term but, more specifically, intertemporally. This is perhaps an insurmountable cognitive challenge, both to investors and central bankers in today's news-flash world. When contemplating the forest, we may intuitively understand nature's logic of growth. Yet when we look at the seeds of destruction we have sown through current monetary policy, it is clear we are lost in the trees.Mr. Spitznagel is the founder and chief investment officer of the hedge fund Universa Investments L.P., based in Santa Monica, Calif.

This thread is hilarious. +1 for entertainment.I think you're angry at this 1985 guy for being a jerk, so you're rationalizing stealing his coins. What needs to happen is for him to apologize for saying what he did and for you to return the coins. Would you be willing to return them in this case?   It changes literally every day. Currently:"Prevailing Interest Rates as of Wed, 25 Apr 2012 21:19:00 +0000BTC - 2.54% APYUSD - 9.84% APY" Has anyone done this just to earn the APY?I am considering it as it seems the safest way to earn interest on BTC, however, my main worry is that they may prevent withdrawals without getting all kinds of crazy info about you. If the Feds ever attack Bitcoin, then expect the exchanges to become frozen IMO.Any opinions on this?Although I trust Bitcoinica, I don't trust the Feds, so at present I keep no funds with Bitcoinica. Which sucks b/c earning interest in a deflationary currency is pretty sweet.

It would have to be way better and it would have to be so different that Bitcoin could not be re-architected into it.But I fail to see how BTC could not be easily modified to adapt to any new cryptocurrency technology.Regardless, if it did happen, it would have to be VASTLY superior to overcome the network effect that BTC has. Think mp3 vs ogg for example - ogg is better, but mp3 is already everywhere, so the cost of transition is not worth the marginal benefit. ah, good catch So last week I went to BitcoinBonus, made an account, clicked on the link to amazon.com, and purchased roughly $50 worth of stuff.I keep checking the account, but no record of the purchase appears anywhere.Has anyone else had luck using this site?

Thanks mate! You know, I thought I was being pretty safe by keep certain addresses secret, keeping my wallet offline and encrypted, etc etc.But I just realized something - I often check the addresses using blockchain.info or blockexplorer.comSince the address is encoded into the URL, my ISP could merely save the places I have visited recently, and bam, someone would know "bitcoin addresses of interest" to me.I suppose the solution is to use TOR to check it, or just use the client ( but I don't want to load my precious offline savings wallet! ). So ideally, the thing would be to have the ability to WATCH or TRACK certain addresses using the Bitcoin client, without having to have the private key for that address.Good idea or bad idea? thanks. I don't want to reveal one of my addresses, but it seems that these two websites are reporting different transactions at present. Specifically, there are txs on blockchain.info that have not appeared on blockexplorer.com.Any ideas? Thanks Yes, serious I'm having the exact same problem, transferred money via dwolla this morning, and about 5 hours later, still nothing
OMG! I found it while digging around on one of my backup flash drives. Not sure who made it, but I found it really funny  Okay, the funny Bitcoin image had this exact face in it ( at the bottom ) saying "I will be worth billions". Sent $50 over to gox, but it hasn't been received (about 3-4 hours ago). Normally only takes a half hour.Just curious if anyone else if having the same problem. +1 awesome +1, I couldn't agree more No, he specifically says "I will be worth billions"It's an older one too, I think I saw it over a year ago It had some guy sitting at a computer taking forever to generate some tiny fraction of a BTC, and then at the end he thinks "soon I will be worth billions..."It's really funny, but I just cannot find it anymore  I do not think of BTC as a stock, I am merely commenting that at the present time all financial assets are highly correlated as a result of the influence of the wildly oversized credit markets ( think giant world-wide debt bubble ). Thus far BTC price movements have also been highly correlated.Really though this is more of a comment about the financial markets in general at their present juncture, and so not really specific to Bitcoin. This could all just be "lawyer speak", i.e. they have to give themselves rights to the moon and back, just so they don't have to worry later on should they require them.Basically, this assumption would mean business as usual, but they're just buying a little extra insurance I have my own analysis of the recent fall in price, on my blog: http://goxxed.blogspot.com/2012/02/btc-back-in-bear-market.htmlTo summarize, I think this means stocks have topped due to a major non-confirmation between the S&P and BTC, which has been the pattern for the past couple years - you may put me on record saying that Does this actually change anything?

Though it came after days of intense debate and the resignation of several ministers in protest, in the end the vote on the austerity measures was not close: 199 in favor and 74 opposed, with 27 abstentions or blank ballots. The Parliament also gave the government the authority to sign a new loan agreement with the foreign lenders and approve a broader arrangement to reduce the amount Greece must repay to its bondholders. The new austerity measures include, among others, a 22 percent cut in the benchmark minimum wage and 150,000 government layoffs by 2015  a bitter prospect in a country ravaged by five years of recession and with unemployment at 21 percent and rising. But the chaos on the streets of Athens, where more than 80,000 people turned out to protest on Sunday, and in other cities across Greece reflected a growing dread  certainly among Greeks, but also among economists and perhaps even European officials  that the sharp belt-tightening and the bailout money it brings will still not be enough to keep the country from going over a precipice. Angry protesters in the capital threw rocks at the police, who fired back with tear gas. After nightfall, demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails, setting fire to more than 40 buildings, including a historic theater in downtown Athens, the worst damage in the city since May 2010, when three people were killed when protesters firebombed a bank. There were clashes in Salonika in the north, Patra in the west, Volos in central Greece, and on the islands of Crete and Corfu. Greece and its foreign lenders are locked in a dangerous brinkmanship over the future of the nation and the euro. Until recently, a Greek default and exit from the euro zone was seen as unthinkable. Now, though experts say that the European Union is not prepared for a default and does not want one, the dynamic has shifted from trying to save Greece to trying to contain the damage if it turns out to be unsalvageable. Theyre trying to lay the ground for it, trying to limit the contagion from it, said Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform, a research institute in London. Still, he added, letting Greece go would set a dangerous precedent, and it would be fanciful to think otherwise. Greeces limping economy yields large trade and budget deficits, and none but the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund  known collectively as the troika  are willing to lend the nation the money it needs to stay afloat. The troika is demanding more concessions to placate Germany and other northern European countries, where the bailout of Greece is a hard sell to voters. For its part, Greece is trying to preserve social and political cohesion in the face of growing unrest, political extremism and a devastated economy that is expected to worsen with more austerity. And the feeling is growing here and abroad that the troikas strategy for Greece is failing. The leaders of two of the three major political parties in Prime Minister Lucas Papademoss interim coalition government  the Socialists and the center-right New Democracy party  agreed on the new round of austerity after days of tense debate, maneuvering and threats. The leader of the third, the right-wing Popular Orthodox Rally, refused to endorse the measures and later withdrew from the coalition. In the debate on Sunday night before the vote, Mr. Papademos appealed to lawmakers to do their patriotic duty and pass the measures, saying they would be saving Greece from bankruptcy in March, when a bond issue comes due that Greece cannot repay without foreign help. In a sign of how the crisis has frayed the political order in Greece, the three leading political parties all moved swiftly to expel lawmakers who had broken ranks with leaders in the voting. Mr. Papademos is a former vice president of the European Central Bank who took office in November with a mandate to negotiate the new loan agreement before new elections are held, perhaps as soon as April. He acknowledged on Sunday that the program calls for sacrifices from a broad range of citizens who have already made sacrifices. But the alternative, he said, a disastrous default, would be worse. European Union finance ministers, who were expected to approve the agreements with Greece at a meeting in Brussels last Thursday, instead sent a vote of no confidence, asking Greece for another $400 million in spending cuts. When they meet again on Wednesday, they are expected to sign off on the measures and raise the stakes. A major topic of discussion is expected to be establishing an escrow account that would hold new money lent to Greece, and using it first to pay creditors, before the Greek government can tap it for any other purpose. The idea, backed by Germany and the Netherlands, may make further loans to Greece more palatable to German voters, but many Greeks see it as a fundamental loss of sovereignty and feel that they are being pushed into poverty to appease banks. Greece will become a protectorate, said Natalia Stefanou, 45, a shoe store employee at a protest outside the Parliament on Sunday. She said she had not been paid since September and may soon lose her job entirely. Its not me Im worried about, though, she said. Ive got two children, aged 14 and 15. What kind of country are we going to leave them? Anti-German sentiment is also on the rise in Greece, where memories of the Nazi occupation during World War II are still vivid. This is worse than the 40s, said Stella Papafagou, 82, who wore a surgical mask at the demonstration to fend off the tear gas. This time the government is following the Germans orders. I would prefer to die with dignity than with my head bent down. European leaders, fearful that Greeces crisis will undermine efforts to help other euro nations like Portugal and Spain, have been trying directly or indirectly in recent days to paint Greece as a special case, whose leaders have failed to transform its troubled and corrupt state fast enough. In an interview last week, the Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, said that in the highly unlikely event of a Greek default, there would be extremely strong political policy and political responses to prevent any such phenomenon to go beyond Greece. Similarly, Fabrizio Saccomanni, the director general of the Bank of Italy, told reporters last week, referring to the risk of contagion, that market indications seem to suggest that this problem is seen as minor. But others say that is wishful thinking. If one country in the monetary union can default, so can another  that is one simple inference that bank managers and hedge fund mangers can infer, no matter what Mrs. Merkel or Mr. Sarkozy may say, said Costas Lapavitsas, an economist at the University of London, referring to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France. Portugal and Ireland have unsustainable debt, he said. Put two and two together, and it makes four. Mr. Lapavitsas, who has been calling for Greece to go ahead and default on its own terms, added that it was absolutely unacceptable that this huge amount of Greek debt that ties the country hand and foot should be dealt with by some unnamed and obscure technocrats and unelected people. If Greece dug itself into a hole by borrowing beyond its means, as many argue, there is also a growing sense that the troikas austerity regimen of spending cuts and tax increases is burying Greece alive in that hole. The reason Greece is in this position is because of the strategy the troika imposed upon it, said Mr. Tilford, of the Center for European Reform. The I.M.F. has never approached a country like this, he said. With this much austerity, it would always have a huge devaluation, too. Financial analysts said they expected investors to welcome news of the vote in Parliament. Its a pause, its a relief, said Milton Ezrati, the senior economist and market strategist at Lord Abbett & Company. But its short-lived and everyone knows that. Were buying a few more months before the next round of trouble. Jerry A. Webman, the senior investment officer and chief economist for Oppenheimer Funds, also struck a cautious note. It doesnt solve the problem, Mr. Webman said, but it gives everybody the political cover to look for ways to solve the real Greek problem, which is how to get the country and its economy back on more stable footing. With more wage cuts and tax increases expected, Greeks are growing increasingly angry at their own lawmakers as well as the troika of lenders. Theyve all sold out in there, they should be punished, said Makis Barbarossos, 37, an insurance salesman, as he waved a cigarette toward Parliament on Sunday. We should put them in small, unheated apartments with 300-euro pensions and see, can they live like that? Can they live how theyre asking us to live? Niki Kitsantonis reported from Athens, and Rachel Donadio from Rome. Julie Creswell contributed reporting from New York, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome. People would try to get around the auto-destruction rule by trading nothing among themselves to make it look like they didnt hoard. Its ridiculous. Yeah, I've heard many free-market pontificators before, but this guy really brings a level of quick common sense and clarity to things that is quite rare.

Loan repaid with 12.25 BTC, please confirm on this thread. Awesome! Thanks. Thanks!
I need 11.2 BTC, please send here:[EDIT - address removed]I will repay 12.2+ BTC tomorrow Question -- how do I specify multiple source addresses for sending BTC? The thing I see is, risk assets are extremely overbought at present, and BTC seems to follow the general flow of liquidity/credit in the broader financial markets.If it does not follow their behavior, then it will be a first for Bitcoin IMO.I of course have no clue what will happen, just postulating here  My reply "5th poster" was in response to your reply "4th poster" that you removed  I saw you delete your 4th poster!  5th poster I was just thinking, right now BTC has a lot of P2P lending, but pooling risk for lending purposes might make more sense. I have a better idea. Take all his loans and package them into the "Pimple Kid High-Yield Investment Fund" - I bet Goldman could auction off shares in no time! And when they go sour, Bernanke will just print the money to cover your @$$. Does anyone know how to donate BTC to this group?Thanks!-BA It was a blast, Plato! Anytime you're in Vegas again drop me a line 19 BTC repaid early, please confirm on this thread - thanks! Crap, need 1 more BTC in this loan. I forgot about transaction fees and am trying to send a very specific amount for asthetic purposes.Will pay back 2 BTC for this additional 1 BTC.Again, address is:[EDIT - address removed]Thanks!-BA Thanks, will do. Looking for a mini-loan to satisfy me until my next super-slow dwolla purchase goes through.I have a very high standing in the community, feel free to research me. I am on honest traders thread etc. Have taken out a micro-loan before as wellI'm using the money to give a gift of BTC to a friend, but I don't have any patience.My receiving address for this transaction:[EDIT - address removed]Thanks!-BA Yep, I ordered one too!We should get more and leave them around Las Vegas in random doctor's offices etc. +1hashing to defenda network of truth that guardsliberty my love Artificial intelligence, music, economics, technical analysisAnd womennice ones +1Financial software is a different world from most.

True, this why you have to be so careful when spending bitcoin! Because it is not immediately obvious in the default client what is going on. The coderr patch makes it much more transparent. Ahhhhh, right.Okay, I feel stupid now Thanks though! I think I'm just not understanding something about the BTC protocol. Can someone explain why Bitcoin splits my transaction into seemingly random-sized smaller transactions, and why it automatically creates a new second address during a transaction ( that is, it sends some coins back to me at a new address)?I thought you could just cleanly sign over a specific number of coins to a new address.Thanks! Thanks!Great patch btw, it should be integrated into the main branch I would go and do this immediately. Okay... what am I doing wrong? I had Bitcoin 0.5.2 installed, and I copied the bitcoin-qt.exe from the patch over the original exe. I re-ran it, and verified it says version 0.5.1 now, but I don't see anything for "send from address".Any ideas? Thanks!used:http://mtgoxlive.com/downloads/bitcoin-v0.5.1+coderrr-win32.zip Have you been tested for parasites? There are objective tests yu can get done for this, and if found, it's pretty easy for doctors to kill them with an IV of drugs. I have a wallet with many addresses. Each address is kept separate for specific reasons, and I wish to spend money from a specific address. How do I achieve this?Thanks! WatchingAwesome work btw! http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=hidden-os Just curious.If I had time I would build it, not that hard.Personally I would use such a service. The market is an interesting place, because market activity never repeats itself. It does rhyme though, like the Mark Twain quote.One can curve fit any indicator or methodology to the past and claim a holy grail, but the future is a different matter entirely. I had version 0.5.1 installed, and then I downloaded and installed version 0.5.2. I ran Bitcoin-qt, and when I click about, it says that it's version 0.5.1.So I simply uninstalled 0.5.1 and installed 0.5.2, problem solved.But I'm not sure why the installer wouldn't overwrite the older version. +1 Coinabul, very professional and communicative I agree with the OPBitcoin trades like a penny stock, moving with speculative fever in the broader market.If stocks crash, I would expect Bitcoin to fall as well, at least temporarily.That said, I'm bullish long term so I would see any move down as a great buying opportunity. Thanks!! It was bytepimp, somehow got that mixed up with bytecoin Another thing to mention is having a separate checking wallet vs savings wallet.The savings wallet should be uber protected and the backups obscured.The checking wallet should be protected as well and backed up, but not obscured. This gives a thief something to find.You may lose your checking if they can crack it, but at least they won't be trying to crack your savings wallet! Sounds good, but I need to get the high-res version before I can do anything with it.The current one is too blurry when expanded for t-shirt size no matter what filter I use. Loan satisfied, that was fast! Thanks. Need 10 bitcentsWill pay back 20 bitcents no later than next monday ( i.e. 9 days from now ). Probably I can pay back by Thursday though.My recieving address:EDIT: address removedReasons for loan:Introducing a friend to Bitcoin and want to send him some bitcents, but my wallet is too large and sacred to permit on my potentially spyware infected windows computer. Dwolla transfer should complete next week so I can pay back then.Thanks!
So I messaged bytepimp who created the awesome Bitcoin graphics, but he seems to be MIA.Anyone else know who he is? I'm looking to get a high-res version of his awesome Bitcoin graphic to make up a few t-shirts.Also, if anyone wants such a t-shirt, let me know. The bottom line is that the government's war on piracy will be about as successful as its war on drugs. Once government gets involved, it's bound to make more problems than it solves. SOPA, for example, will eventually be used for far more sinister purposes than just fighting piracy.Although I don't approve of piracy personally, I also don't believe that anyone has the moral right to force me to pay (taxes) to support police that protect their property - no matter if it's intellectual or physical or whatever. Rather, it is every property owner's duty to pay the cost of defending ownership, NOT the non-owners of that property. If it was, that would be slavery!This is one more reason I like Bitcoin. A Bitcoin is my property not because of some complex philosophy, not because government says it is so, not because goons will come attack you if you take it, but because *you don't have my private key*.If Microsoft can stop people from pirating Windows good for them, if they can't that's their problem. But that's Anarchy, and anarchy is where technology is slowly taking us - get used to it. It had to be said.F*ck SOPA I'm not interesting in using your strategy, however, I would be very interested in your base platform as a way to write, execute, and backtest my own strategies.Let me know Hey anyone thought of the potential that we're in a large B wave and that we'll ultimately hit new lows (below $2) before the next major wave 3 that takes us above $32?I lean more towards the idea that's we're starting wave 3 up, but I think the alternative is definitely possible. I hope for the alternative since then I can accumulate more coins  Yes I said BTC, but I'm actually quite bullish on the USD right now, think it's going to new highs as deflation sets in again in 2012. Hey guys, this sounds great! I live here in Las Vegas I don't think I'll be able to go though, I'm still too sick with my CMP problem.Hopefully you'll do it again next year. +1 DeathAndTaxes, sold best buy gift cards, paid quickly and was friendly +1Another thing late adopters don't get is what early adopters were thinking. To illustrate, I have a friend who mined about 5K bitcoins long before the first bubble and cashed out for practically nothing, he just thought "they were fun". I thought of them in the same way -- I got my first coins from selling an unused copy of Windows 7 on biddingpond just for fun. Early adopters were not thinking "I'm going to be rich!" at all, they thought BTC was just play money. I was kicking myself for not getting more back then when the price jumped. Late adopters don't understand this. There was no premeditation or anything for the vast majority of early adopters, it was just damn luck. It was also very hard to get BTC back then, you often had to sell stuff or do cash in the mail due to exchange problems.Not to mention that I got royaly goxxed and all my "early adopter" coins were stolen anyway. I bought back in when it hit $3 (and keeping them safe this time!), and now have far more coins than before. This "second chance" to get into BTC on a fire sale was a real gift, and if you didn't take advantage of it, you have no right to complain. Bubbles happen. It's human nature. You can't stop them.People made way too much out of the last bubble, proclaiming the "end of bitcoin" when it popped. All nonsense. It was just a hype bubble, nothing new in the world here.That's why if you believe in Bitcoin, as I do, but you're not into market timing or speculating, you can just use dollar cost averaging by buying BTC every month -- and stop worrying so much about the day-to-day price changes. Let the speculators sweat that stuff, you don't have to if you only care about the long-term success of BTC.I've bought BTC at 6 cents, and I've bought it at $30. Overall I've been increasing my wealth since I discovered BTC because the long-term trend is up. And I don't worry about it. jesse from Ogrr.com has won the auction for 4 btc! DeathAndTaxes, you have won the auction with the highest bid for 8.25 BTC!Just send to my BTC address (below) and PM me telling me if you want the codes electronically and how you want them, or if you want me to physically mail the cards along with a mailing address.

I especially like the section about "The Manipulator", personally I have never believed in him/her But this is probably the best rundown of the important properties, as well as pitfalls, of Bitcoin that I've seen. FYI I cross posted to https://ogrr.com/viewtopic.php?f=74&t=243&p=6005 btc is still the highest bid though 4 BTC is now highest bid from https://ogrr.com/viewtopic.php?f=74&t=168 FOSM - Free and Open Source Moneyyes? no? good or just stupid?
Post your bitcoin address here and maybe we can get some money together for you to go to the doctor. I'll put in 25 btc to start. You should get checked for bacteria and parasites just to allieviate your concern about that potential. However, your description seems more neurological to me than caused by any kind of infection. Infection of any type would likely make you sick ( throwing up, etc ) have you seen a neurologist?Also, had you been suffering from a lot of stress prior to the onset of symptoms? Stress shuts down immune activity and increases muscle tension and can cause nerve injury. In my case once I stopped worrying about my condition, I finally started to slowly improve. My advice for you if you don't know what it is yet, you should keep journaling, see more doctors, stay calm, and above all, do the activities that relieve your symptoms as much as possible, because they could be the key to eventually eliminating them. If a hot bath helps, then do this every day for an hour and see if after a month you notice any difference in symptoms. I sit in a really hot bath every day for about 2-3 hours, and after one month I'm finally really noticing a marked decrease in symptoms. Basically, just journal what you feel symptomatically, and what you were doing physically and how you were feeling emotionally at th onset, and eventually patterns may emerge. With these patterns, you can learn to avoid aggravating thoughts and actions, and pursue what seems to help.I would try the doctor route for a bit, but if they can't help or figure it out, I would try the approach I have outlined above, if you can find any correlations they could be the key to getting better. A Festivus for the restofus 3 btc is now highest bid from ogrr forumNote that I don't have to mail it, I can just send you the gift code Okay, so I registered and opening up bidding on that forum as well Um, is this you? If so, place your bid here. Anything else other than the crawling sensations? Any shooting pain, cramps, muscle spasms, numbness, weakness, constipation?Also, have you had injury or accident (like a car accident) or any kind of surgery? Have you had an MRI or EMG done? I have buys around 3.6 because of the trendline S3052 identified, so if we correct I would expect it to be hitOf course, if it is broken we could have a larger correctionEither way I'm long term bullish Can you describe the sensations in more detail? Do you experience pain of any burning or aching variety? Are there any visible abnormalities, or do you look comoetely healthy? How long have you had this? Has it increased in intensity over time? Does it wax and wane? Did it begin in the gnital region or lower body region, or pretty much evwrywhere ( that is, what is the pattern of spreading )? Do you find any relief in symptoms from relaxing in a hot bath?Sorry for all the questions but I too have a disease that is very debilitating and no doctors were able to diagnose ( every test in the world came back negative, they ended up kicking me out of the hospital and telling me it was all "in my head"). I was in so much physical pain that for the first and only time in my life I consiered suicide. But the free market saved me, a bit of time on google and then a visit to a private clinic, I found I was suffering from full body chronic myofacial pain (CMP). I still have it now, it's a very weird disease that can produce all kinds of weird and painful sensations, but I have slowly been getting better since I started treatment. It feels like fibromyalgia in some ways, but luckily, it's very treatable and much more well understood ( except for some reason not understood by the 10+ idiot doctors that I saw ). It is also particularly virulent in the genital region simply because of referred pain from pelvic muscles ( also called chronic pelvic pain or CPPS, which is merely a subset of myofacial pain/CMP). But it is not due to a virus or bacteria or anything, it's a neuro-muscular disorder.Maybe there is no connection here, but the point I need to make is to NOT GIVE UP keep researching, it is up to you to figure it out, you will find out the cause eventually. I lost all respect for doctors after my journey, and realize now that you are truely on your own to fight for your life.

I believe .rewrite is the old wallet, which ideally should be "rewritten" over since it may hold unencrypted private keys as a result of a bug in the 0.4 wallet encryption code. Ideally though if you used the built in encryption prior to 0.5 you should transfer your coins to a new wallet in case the old one has leaked. Shoot, was going to upload the picture today but forgot to bring my camera (I'm in office now). Picture is a bit blurry anyway as my digital camera is not very good. I'll try to upload it tonight anyhoo.In any event, it's in perfect mint condition, still in a clear plastic bag. Honestly I would keep it, but I strongly prefer Bitcions to gold since they are more liquid and (IMO) carry more upside potential (and more risk).What form of shipping do you recommed? Any details on insurance policies that you utilize when shipping gold?ThanksEDIT: Also, you can find recommendations for me on the "trustworthy traders" thread. I checked this box on Bitcoin v0.5.1 on Win7 SP1, nothing happens after a long pause and then the box never actually checks.The process is set to exempt from MSE so I don't think MSE is blocking any particular API call.Any ideas?Thanks SONIC BOOM!

PM me if interested.EDIT - moved to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=55343.0 I have a 1oz American Eagle gold coin that I'm looking to get rid of. PM me if interested. I agree... And I think we actually agree on things, we're just defining terms here. 100% accuracy is impossible, but an effective trading system does not require this, all it needs is a tiny edge, and that's enough to consistently make money, until the underling market conditions that create the edge change.So I think we're in agreement really. It's just a red button for me whenever people say things like "make money no matter what the market does" and "you will make millions" because people can easily overload if they believe this and blowup when their assumptions about drawdowns etc are forced to change with the market. Or they stop using the system during a bad DD, and thus lose money despite the contiuing profitabilty of the system. LTCM is a good example, or perhap an even better example is that fact the individual invstors tend to underperform the funds they invest in. There are many psychological traps that cause novice investors to lose money even in good systems, and unrealistic expectations are like gasoline on the fire.That said, building trading systems is a great and rewarding enterprise but if you've been around the block long enough you develop a healthy sense of realism about it, and realize that effective money management is key. It's one thing thing to theorize and backtest but another to continue to have success applying a method into the unknown future. That's really my only point here. Honestly though I believe your system probably has a nice edge, or else you wouldn't be so excited about it, and I wish you the best applying it into the future. And yes, I am curious of course  This is actually a really good point, since although philisophically the answer is the same, in practicality you're right this is basically free money. So my above answer really is applicable to the larger markets where this type of oportunity is already arbitraged out of the market, or in the arena of a single exchange treated as a closed system. Btw totally unrelated, but I'm a real fan of your show. That's where I learned about The Real Plato, and eventually I met up with him in Las Vegas . Good times... We introduced Bitcoins to Penn and Teller If the underlying stock falls more than your premium, you lose money, so the forecast is that the premiums will make up for the drawdowns over time. ( In reality though you would need to be more specific with the forecast if you wanted to actually use the system. )I've heard many money managers adamantly state that they don't predict the future, they just "manage the proccess" or "react" to the market, but the plain reality is that all trading involves prediction of some aspect of the market. Understanding this and knowing the exact nature of your forecast in a statistical sense is the real key to successful trading, because once you understand this then trading system design becomes merely a way to exploit that particlar market tendency, along with managing money based on the distribution of the individual trades, and rules for determining system burnout.I think people are often so hopeful for "the perfect system" that they overlook the underlying forecast and thus don't clearly identify the risk. A strategy could be forecasting a spread or any number of future things without directly forecasting price targets, but it is still a prediction. All trading requires probabilistic forecasting. So I am infamously an early adopter who stored a lot of bitcoins on MyBitcoin, which of course were stolen.This time around I wish to keep them secure! So here is what I have done, please let me know how secure I am being, and if there's anything else I can do:(1) Created a password-protected wallet with 20 addresses using a 20+ char password with a mix of letter, symbols, numbers(2) send all my old btc to one of the addresses in this wallet(3) copied the wallet.dat, renamed to obfuscate, and encrypted again with 7-zip ( a different password, but only 10+ chars this time ). uploaded this to several servers as a backup. [main purpose is to obfuscate the fact that it's even a wallet at all](4) never use the password for my local wallet (i.e. *assume* that I have a keylogger installed). yet, use this password at boot time (for TrueCrypt), which means I will not forget it (which would be a bigger problem than theft)(5) created a second wallet for "checking", which I do enter the password from time-to-time the client to spend bitcoins(6) if I ever need to tap my savings wallet, I will use a linux liveCD to ensure that I do not have a keylogger tracing the password. I simply send coins over to checking)(7) use btcbalance.net to monitor the addresses regularlyNot sure what else I can do to be safe. Any other ideas would be greatly appreciated, thanks![Btw, the last step which I haven't done, is to find a way to relinquish control of the coins to the persons(s) I have outlined in my will. I'm thinking right now I just have to  trust someone with the information. But in the future, a cool idea might be a time-release data website of some sort, where a family member would use their login to check for information -- information which I put in for them yet which I must login every 6 months or something to keep the timer reset so they cannot access it. If I don't login in a 6-month period, I'm presumed dead, and they get the necessary info to access their inherited coins.] If you have a good system, you could make a lot of money starting a fund or selling/leasing it to existing funds. Have you considered this? Post more stats -- your drawdowns, a chart of what your returns looks like, your sharp ratio, what % of the time you spend in the market (always fully invested, or is it dynamic). What basket do you run it on? Is it 100% automated? What platform do you use? How do you determine system burnout? There's a LOT more information you would need to post before anyone would take this seriously. Yes I would include those since they're bitcoin denominated I am doing the same thing Just curious I already voted, it's 2%. That means 98% liquid wealth in USD, gold, etc and 2% in BTC.Note that "liquid wealth" does not include your house or your car, etc. It's simply financial assets that can be quickly sold for cash.I'm hoping to get this up to 4% soon, since I'm really prefering BTC to any other financial asset. But there's risk by concentrating too much in any asset of course http://www.infowars.com/senate-moves-to-allow-military-to-intern-americans-without-trial/Senate Moves To Allow Military To Intern Americans Without TrialNDAA detention provision would turn America into a battlefieldPaul Joseph WatsonInfowars.comMonday, November 28, 2011The Senate is set to vote on a bill today that would define the whole of the United States as a battlefield and allow the U.S. Military to arrest American citizens in their own back yard without charge or trial.The Senate is going to vote on whether Congress will give this presidentand every future president  the power to order the military to pick up and imprison without charge or trial civilians anywhere in the world. The power is so broad that even U.S. citizens could be swept up by the military and the military could be used far from any battlefield, even within the United States itself, writes Chris Anders of the ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeUnder the worldwide indefinite detention without charge or trial provision of S.1867, the National Defense Authorization Act bill, which is set to be up for a vote on the Senate floor this week, the legislation will basically say in law for the first time that the homeland is part of the battlefield, said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who supports the bill.The bill was drafted in secret by Senators Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), before being passed in a closed-door committee meeting without any kind of hearing. The language appears in sections 1031 and 1032 of the NDAA bill.I would also point out that these provisions raise serious questions as to who we are as a society and what our Constitution seeks to protect, Colorado Senator Mark Udall said in a speech last week. One section of these provisions, section 1031, would be interpreted as allowing the military to capture and indefinitely detain American citizens on U.S. soil. Section 1031 essentially repeals the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 by authorizing the U.S. military to perform law enforcement functions on American soil. That alone should alarm my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, but there are other problems with these provisions that must be resolved.This means Americans could be declared domestic terrorists and thrown in a military brig with no recourse whatsoever. Given that the Department of Homeland Security has characterized behavior such as buying gold, owning guns, using a watch or binoculars, donating to charity, using the telephone or email to find information, using cash, and all manner of mundane behaviors as potential indicators of domestic terrorism, such a provision would be wide open to abuse.American citizens and people picked up on American or Canadian or British streets being sent to military prisons indefinitely without even being charged with a crime. Really? Does anyone think this is a good idea? And why now? asks Anders.The ACLU is urging citizens to call their Senator and demand that the Udall Amendment be added to the bill, [Ed: but pass the bill!] a change that would at least act as a check to prevent Americans being snatched off the streets without some form of Congressional oversight.We have been warning for over a decade that Americans would become the target of laws supposedly aimed at terrorists and enemy combatants. Alex Jones personally documented how U.S. troops were being trained to arrest U.S. citizens in the event of martial law during urban warfare training drills back in the 90′s.  Under the National Defense Authorization Act bill, no declaration of martial law is necessary since Americans would now be subject to the same treatment as suspected insurgents in places like Afghanistan and Iraq.If you thought that the executive assassination of American citizens abroad was bad enough, now similar powers will be extended to the homeland, in other words, your town, your community, your back yard.*********************Paul Joseph Watson is the editor and writer for Prison Planet.com.

The shit is hitting the fanhttp://www.unelected.org/audit-of-the-federal-reserve-reveals-16-trillion-in-secret-bailoutsThe first ever GAO(Government Accountability Office) audit of the Federal Reserve was carried out in the past few months due to the Ron Paul, Alan Grayson Amendment to the Dodd-Frank bill, which passed last year. Jim DeMint, a Republican Senator, and Bernie Sanders, an independent Senator, led the charge for a Federal Reserve audit in the Senate, but watered down the original language of the house bill(HR1207), so that a complete audit would not be carried out. Ben Bernanke(pictured to the left), Alan Greenspan, and various other bankers vehemently opposed the audit and lied to Congress about the effects an audit would have on markets. Nevertheless, the results of the first audit in the Federal Reserves nearly 100 year history were posted on Senator Sanders webpage earlier this morning:  http://sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=9e2a4ea8-6e73-4be2-a753-62060dcbb3c3What was revealed in the audit was startling: $16,000,000,000,000.00 had been secretly given out to US banks and corporations and foreign banks everywhere from France to Scotland. From the period between December 2007 and June 2010, the Federal Reserve had secretly bailed out many of the worlds banks, corporations, and governments. The Federal Reserve likes to refer to these secret bailouts as an all-inclusive loan program, but virtually none of the money has been returned and it was loaned out at 0% interest. Why the Federal Reserve had never been public about this or even informed the United States Congress about the $16 trillion dollar bailout is obvious  the American public would have been outraged to find out that the Federal Reserve bailed out foreign banks while Americans were struggling to find jobs.To place $16 trillion into perspective, remember that GDP of the United States is only $14.12 trillion. The entire national debt of the United States government spanning its 200+ year history is only $14.5 trillion. The budget that is being debated so heavily in Congress and the Senate is only $3.5 trillion. Take all of the outrage and debate over the $1.5 trillion deficit into consideration, and swallow this Red pill: There was no debate about whether $16,000,000,000,000 would be given to failing banks and failing corporations around the world.In late 2008, the TARP Bailout bill was passed and loans of $800 billion were given to failing banks and companies. That was a blatant lie considering the fact that Goldman Sachs alone received 814 billion dollars. As is turns out, the Federal Reserve donated $2.5 trillion to Citigroup, while Morgan Stanley received $2.04 trillion. The Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank, a German bank, split about a trillion and numerous other banks received hefty chunks of the $16 trillion.This is a clear case of socialism for the rich and rugged, youre-on-your-own individualism for everyone else.  Bernie Sanders(I-VT) When you have conservative Republican stalwarts like Jim DeMint(R-SC) and Ron Paul(R-TX) as well as self identified Democratic socialists like Bernie Sanders all fighting against the Federal Reserve, you know that it is no longer an issue of Right versus Left. When you have every single member of the Republican Party in Congress and progressive Congressmen like Dennis Kucinich sponsoring a bill to audit the Federal Reserve, you realize that the Federal Reserve is an entity onto itself, which has no oversight and no accountability.Americans should be swelled with anger and outrage at the abysmal state of affairs when an unelected group of bankers can create money out of thin air and give it out to megabanks and supercorporations like Halloween candy. If the Federal Reserve and the bankers who control it believe that they can continue to devalue the savings of Americans and continue to destroy the US economy, they will have to face the realization that their trillion dollar printing presses will eventually plunder the world economy.The list of institutions that received the most money from the Federal Reserve can be found on page 131 of the GAO Audit and are as follows..Citigroup: $2.5 trillion ($2,500,000,000,000)Morgan Stanley: $2.04 trillion ($2,040,000,000,000)Merrill Lynch: $1.949 trillion ($1,949,000,000,000)Bank of America: $1.344 trillion ($1,344,000,000,000)Barclays PLC (United Kingdom): $868 billion ($868,000,000,000)Bear Sterns: $853 billion ($853,000,000,000)Goldman Sachs: $814 billion ($814,000,000,000)Royal Bank of Scotland (UK): $541 billion ($541,000,000,000)JP Morgan Chase: $391 billion ($391,000,000,000)Deutsche Bank (Germany): $354 billion ($354,000,000,000)UBS (Switzerland): $287 billion ($287,000,000,000)Credit Suisse (Switzerland): $262 billion ($262,000,000,000)Lehman Brothers: $183 billion ($183,000,000,000)Bank of Scotland (United Kingdom): $181 billion ($181,000,000,000)BNP Paribas (France): $175 billion ($175,000,000,000)and many many more including banks in Belgium of all placesView the 266-page GAO audit of the Federal Reserve(July 21st, 2011): http://www.scribd.com/doc/60553686/GAO-Fed-InvestigationSource: http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-696FULL PDF on GAO server: http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11696.pdfSenator Sanders Article: http://sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=9e2a4ea8-6e73-4be2-a753-62060dcbb3c3             
It IS the rabbit! Look at the bones! Death comes with nasty shqrp pointed teeth I also withdrew about 91 coins a week ago, but they never showed in block explorer. I opened a ticket and it just says it's pending an investigation.I think something went wrong last Tuesday for Btc withdrawals, because I have actually mde subsequent withdrawals that have gone through. 6 cents Same here, although I don't really use them anymore, but my login def is not working. I switched to tradehill since mtgox cost me alot of bitcoins in the debacle. I will never use them again. mybitcoin account hacked, lost all my coins, a LOT of themthis is the direct result of the mtgox hack/leak A rollback on mtgox won't help people who has mybitcoin accounts that were stolen as a direct result of the mtgox password leak You'd need to rollback the entire block chain, and that ain't gonna happen I wish I had never left my money on mybitcoin... Used the same password as my mtgox... Stupid? Yes, very stupid.I won't divulge the exact amount, but it was pretty substantial as I am one (was one?) of the early adopters.

So please help spread the word on what I believe is probably one of the best and most immediate applications of Bitcoin! +1 ah hahahahhahaa love it +1Bitcoin is a STARTUP currency. Without speculation, it would probably be impossible to bootstrap the currency, because new economies take a long time to develop. Early adopters have to be rewarded. What other way would possibly work? Voted. Not unless you can build a pattern-matching system that performs T.A. and back-test it over enough data. Otherwise, no, you cannot do any rigorous statistical analysis.Plus, predicting direction is not the same as a trading strategy. You need a fully-fledged strategy to calculate alpha, not a prediction method. Just ordered this from makestickers.com, can't wait to put it on my car!  The reason they're falling is simple. The broader economy is slipping back into deflation. This makes inflation hedges like Bitcoin less attractive.Bitcoin always tops with the stock market, or at least it has so far, and acts much like a penny stock. The last peak in BTC occurred prior to the flash crash, and so it's absolutely no surprise to see it falling right now as stocks fall and t-bonds rise.I'm planing to buy a lot of BTC eventually but I've been waiting for the next major deflationary phase to run its course first.Naturally, this is all my personal option/conjecture.

Here's another good one that has a couple pages on Bitcoin:2011 Observations on the Digital Currency Industryhttp://www.dgcmagazine.com/blog/index.php/2010/12/06/2011-observations-on-the-digital-currency-industry/ I know a girl who is an ancap . Very cool too.But lives too far away  http://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-based-dns-to-counter-us-domain-seizures-101130/BitTorrent Based DNS To Counter US Domain SeizuresThe domain seizures by the United States authorities in recent days and upcoming legislation that could make similar takeovers even easier in the future, have inspired a group of enthusiasts to come up with a new, decentralized and BitTorrent-powered DNS system. This system will exchange DNS information through peer-to-peer transfers and will work with a new .p2p domain extension.In a direct response to the domain seizures by US authorities during the last few days, a group of established enthusiasts have started working on a DNS system that cant be touched by any governmental institution. [ed. sounds similar to Bitcoin]Ironically, considering the seizure of the Torrent-Finder meta-search engine domain, the new DNS system will be partly powered by BitTorrent.In recent months, global anti-piracy efforts have increasingly focused on seizing domains of allegedly infringing sites. In the United States the proposed COICA bill is explicitly aimed at increasing the governments censorship powers, but seizing a domain name is already quite easy, as illustrated by ICE and Department of Justice actions last weekend and earlier this year.For governments it is apparently quite easy to take over the DNS entries of domains, not least because several top level domains are managed by US-based corporations such as VeriSign, who work closely together with the US Department of Commerce. According to some, this setup is a threat to the open internet.To limit the power governments have over domain names, a group of enthusiasts has started working on a revolutionary system that can not be influenced by a government institution, or taken down by pulling the plug on a central server. Instead, it is distributed by the people, with help from a BitTorrent-based application that people install on their computer.According to the projects website, the goal is to create an application that runs as a service and hooks into the hosts DNS system to catch all requests to the .p2p TLD while passing all other request cleanly through. Requests for the .p2p TLD will be redirected to a locally hosted DNS database.By creating a .p2p TLD that is totally decentralized and that does not rely on ICANN or any ISPs DNS service, and by having this application mimic force-encrypted BitTorrent traffic, there will be a way to start combating DNS level based censoring like the new US proposals as well as those systems in use in countries around the world including China and Iran amongst others.The Dot-P2P project was literally started a few days ago, but already the developers are making great progress. It is expected that a beta version of the client can be released relatively shortly, a team member assured TorrentFreak.The project has been embraced by many familiar names in the P2P-community. Former Pirate Bay spokesman Peter Sunde is among them, and the people from EZTV have been promoting it as well.For me its mostly to scare back. To show that if they try anything, we have weapons of making it harder for them to abuse it. If they then back down, we win, Peter Sunde told TorrentFreak in a comment.Although the initiators of the project are still debating on various technical issues on how the system should function, it seems that the administrative part has been thought out. The .p2p domain registration will be handled by OpenNIC, an alternative community based DNS network. OpenNIC also maintains the .geek, .free, .null and several other top level domains.On the other hand, there are also voices that are for distributed domain registration, which would keep the system entirely decentralized.The domain registrations will be totally free, but registrants will have to show that they own a similar domain with a different extension first, to prevent scammers from taking over a brand.The new P2P-based DNS system will require users to run an application on their own computer before they can access the domains, but there are also plans to create a separate root-server (like OpenNIC) as a complimentary service. Its worth noting that the DNS changes will only affect the new .p2p domains, it will not interfere with access to any other domains.It will be interesting to see in what direction this project goes and how widely it will be adopted. There are already talks of getting Internet Service Providers to accept the .p2p extension as well, but even if this doesnt happen the system can always be accessed through the BitTorrent-powered application and supporting DNS servers.If anything, this shows that no matter what legislation or legal actions are taken, technology stays always one step ahead. The more aggressive law enforcement gets, the more creative and motivated adopters of the Open Internet will respond.  You see this is one more reason I like voluntaryism. U want to love in a communist society? Then find like minded people and do it. Just so long as I'm free to disagree and live the way I want to live. Nothing wrong with socialism provided that its voluntary. Insurance, for example, is a form of voluntary socialism to an extent. I chose left-libertarian, but I'm thinking I'm really an anarcho-capitalist in practice. My understanding (incorrect perhaps?) is that they're basically the same thing, except that left-libertarians actively pursue counter-economics as their strategy for achieving anarchism. Am I confusing this with agorism?Maybe I'll just say I'm a voluntaryist and leave it at that. I don't particularly like the term "anarcho-capitalist" because it emphasizes capitalism, whereas I believe any voluntary interaction is moral, capitalistic or not (although I believe that in voluntaryism, 95% of economic behavior would be anarcho-capitalism, but my point is that it doesn't have to be, so emphasis on "voluntary" as being the overarching guide for society).Take Linux for example. That's the ultimate example of voluntaryism. It's NOT socialism like what some people claim, because there's no force or violence involved. It's also not typically the type of thing that people think of as capitalism, even though it is strongly related due to its decentralized nature.Voluntaryist out. Are you running anti-virus on a windows box? That could explain crazy harddisk behavior. If so, you should put the bitcoin executable on the list of "ignore" processes. One final thing I thought of -- you should look into undelete software immediately (before you start writing to that area of the disk). You might be able to recover the files. I used to use Active Undelete back in the day on my old windows box, it saved me a few times. Yes.Yes, it is deflationary.Eventually the Sun will burn out and everyone on earth will die. So yes, but with 8 decimals of divisibility Bitcoins should last a long time. And even beyond that, the code can always be forked, modified, etc so that issues are fixed, or new and better currencies are spawned. That's the beauty of open source. Yep.Although I must say, cash in the mail can be quite fun when it works out I don't know why, it just has a certain excitement to it... I think it just opened recently. The server is working for me ...see http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1888.0 Also, with the advent of bitcoingateway.com, I don't think cash-in-the-mail is the best way to buy them anymore. I did a similar transaction and it took 5 days. I would give it up to 10 though before declaring an issue. If it wasn't mailable, you should have gotten it returned to you. There's only something like a 1% chance that it got lost in the mail.Don't trade with anyone who doesn't have a good reputation on the forums. I like Bitcoin because it actually provides the properties of money. Dollars do not -- how can you have any economic security if your savings depreciate at the whims of politicians? Or if they create a monetary system that is designed to expand credit into a bubble that collapses every so often?Secondly, I like how it is nearly impossible to steal them. Your dollar savings, on the other hand, are easy as pie to steal -- just ask anyone who has been involved in an unjust lawsuit.I originally discovered Bitcoins through an Austrian Economics Distribution list at the company that I work. That was right about the time it was Slashdotted. Wish I had gotten in even sooner, of course. Nice! I didn't realize the EFF article would attract so much attention. Kudos. Some people like red snakes, some people like blue snakes. Some people want a snake with more venom, some prefer a different rattle. No matter the form, it still hurts when the snake bites you. So you go out to convince people to vote for a different snake, you try to explain that smaller snakes are less painful. But this will never work: people are too diverse in their opinions, and the one thing most of them have in common is that they support the snake. So voting doesn't work, convincing doesn't work, and fighting the snake doesn't work because it's too dangerous (and if you resort to violence you're no different than the snake, potentially you could even become the snake), so what does work? Only one thing will work, and only one thing is moral: defense. Armor plated boots so the snake cannot bite. Grab your pair now -- use Bitcoin P2P Cryptocurrency, www.bitcoin.org. Was it made clear that "Bitcoins are the #1 most important development in the fight for freedom in this century" to get his attention?I facebooked him about BTCs a couple months ago and got no response, but I didn't phrase it like the above (rather, it was a long-winded explaination of BTCs with a request for an interview with Satoshi, so naturally he didn't want to do something that he didn't understand is my guess...) What you're describing is the future of much education IMO. Tuition fees at universities are extreme, which is crazy since so much knowledge can be imparted easily online at zero cost -- for example, take a look at MIT's open courseware. I could easily see current 100K college degrees being done nearly for free online (or partially online) in the future. There will be quite a backlash against this trend from the academic community though... I'll send you a couple bytecoins for a wordcoin. I think that despite the crash, BTC prices count best as a five wave move to their peak, with an extended fifth "blowoff" move. This means they trade like commodities IMO.This would imply that after a low-volume corrective period, we should eventually have another move and take out the highs.Just my 2 bit opinion. +1 theymos, honest trader, thanks for the fast transaction!
Why the heck would you use Facebook's currency that they tax at 30% when you could use Bitcoin?? True, and ultimately hyperinflation would destroy the Fed itself, so despite what people think the Fed would not desire this. They do, of course, want to inflate to bail out their buddies etc, but just so long as they do it discretely and slowly enough so that the public doesn't lose trust in their crappy money. bitcoin=QE2...oh wait, it doesn't affect me. Did you make this video? It's fantastic! I mean, does he have a username here? In case you dont know who John Carmack is, hes the famous 3D game programmer that gave us Doom and Quake.Seems like he might be a bit of a libertarian too.from http://media.armadilloaerospace.com/misc/government.htmJohn Carmack on 10-28-2010Almost everything that I write publicly is about technical details in software or aerospace, and the points are usually not very contentious.  Im going to go out on a limb today and talk about a much more banal topic - government.  This is sort of an open letter to my mother and stepfather, who are intelligent people, but we dont see eye to eye on political issues.  A couple brief conversations a year during visits doesnt really establish much, and I have wanted to make a more carefully considered set of points.I had nearly disqualified myself from discuss politics by not bothering to cast a vote for almost 20 years after I was legally able to.  I was busy.  I paid millions of dollars of taxes without any dodges, and just focused on my work.  Listening to political speeches full of carefully calculated rhetoric is almost physically painful to me, and I diligently avoided it. A couple things slowly brought me around to paying more attention.  A computer game company doesnt need to have much to do with the government, but a company that flies rocket ships is a different matter.  Due to Armadillo Aerospace, in the last decade I have observed and interacted with a lot of different agencies, civil servants, and congressmen, and I have collected enough data points to form some opinions.  The second thing that has changed for me is becoming a father; with two young sons, I think more about how the world might look in twenty or thirty years when they are adults.I am an optimist on almost all fronts.  Throughout history, there have always been those that argue that the world is going to hell, yet here we are, better off than any previous generation.  Not only are things pretty damn good, but there is a lot of positive inertia that makes it likely that things will continue to  improve for quite some time.  We arent balanced at a precipice, where the result of any given election can pitch us into darkness.However, trends do matter.  Small, nearly painless losses accumulate over the years, and the world can slowly change into something you dont want while you werent paying attention.  It doesnt take a cataclysmic crash, just a slow accretion of over regulation, taxation, and dependency that chokes the vibrant processes that produce wealth and growth.  Without growth, you get a zero sum game of fighting over the pie that breeds all sorts of problems in government and society.My core thesis is that the federal government delivers very poor value for the resources it consumes, and that society as a whole would be better off with a government that was less ambitious.  This is not to say that it doesnt provide many valuable and even critical services, but that the cost of having the government provide them is much higher than you would tolerate from a company or individual you chose to do business with.  For almost every task, it is a poor tool.So much of the government just grinds up money, like shoveling cash into a wood chipper.  It is ghastly to watch.  Billions and billions of dollars.  Imagine every stupid dot-com company that you ever heard of that suckered in millions of dollars of investor money before leaving a smoking crater in the ground with nothing to show for it.  Add up all that waste, all that stupidity.  All together, it is a rounding error versus the analogous program results in the government.  Private enterprises cant go on squandering resources like that for long, but it is standard operating procedure for the government.Well, cant we make the government more efficient, so they can accomplish its tasks for less, or do more good work?  Sure, there is room for improvement everywhere, but there are important fundamental limits.  It is entertaining to imagine a corporate turnaround expert being told to get the federal house in shape, but it cant happen.  The modern civil service employment arrangement is probably superior to the historic jobs-as-political-spoils approach, but it insulates the workforce from the forces that improve commercial enterprises, and the voting influence of each worker is completely uncorrelated with their value.  Without the goal and scorecard of profit, it is hard to even make value judgments between people and programs, so there are few checks against mounting inefficiency and abject failure, let alone evolution towards improvement.Even if you could snap your fingers and get it, do you really want a razor sharp federal apparatus ready to efficiently carry out the mandates of whoever is the supreme central planner at the moment?  The US government was explicitly designed to make that difficult, and I think that was wise.  So, the federal government is essentially doomed to inefficiency, no matter who is in charge or what policies they want it to implement.  I probably havent lost too many people at this point  almost nobody thinks that the federal government is a paragon of efficiency, and it doesnt take too much of an open mind to entertain the possibility that it might be much worse than you thought (it is).Given the inefficiency, why is the federal government called upon to do so many things?  A large part is naked self interest, which is never going to go away -- lots of people play the game to their best advantage, and even take pride in their ability to get more than they give.However, a lot is done in the name of misplaced idealism.  It isnt hard to look around the world and find something that you feel needs fixing.  The world gets to be a better place by people taking action to improve things, but it is easy for the thought to occur that if the government can be made to address your issue, it could give results far greater than what you would be able to accomplish with direct action.  Even if you knew that it wasnt going to be managed especially well, it would make up for it in volume.  This has an obvious appeal. Every idealistic cry for the government to Do Something means raising revenue, which means taking money from people to spend in the name of the new cause instead of letting it be used for whatever purpose the earner would have preferred.It is unfortunate that income taxes get deducted automatically from most peoples paychecks, before they ever see the money they earned.  A large chunk of the population thinks that tax day is when you get a nice little refund check.  Good trick, that.  If everyone was required to pay taxes like they pay their utilities, attitudes would probably change.  When you get an appallingly high utility bill, you start thinking about turning off some lights and changing the thermostat.  When your taxes are higher than all your other bills put together, what do you do?  You can make a bit of a difference by living in Texas instead of California, but you dont have many options regarding the bulk of it.Also, it is horribly crass to say it, but taxes are extracted by the threat of force.  I know a man (Walt Anderson), who has been in jail for a decade because the IRS disagreed with how his foundations were set up, so it isnt an academic statement.  What things do you care strongly enough about to feel morally justified in pointing a gun at me to get me to pay for them?  A few layers of distance by proxy let most people avoid thinking about it, but that is really what it boils down to.  Feeding starving children?  The justice system?  Chemotherapy for the elderly?  Viagra for the indigent?  Corn subsidies?Helping people directly can be a noble thing.  Forcing other people to do it with great inefficiency?  Not so much.  There isnt a single thing that I would petition the federal government to add to its task list, and I would ask that it stop doing the majority of the things that it is currently doing.  My vote is going to the candidates that at least vector in that direction. Who does the blog "The Monetary Future"? Anyone know? I have a question for them.Thanks! Same here. I had completely given up on the EFF, even after they sent the mail confirming that they would do this. Mega surprise!I bet the recent increase in valuations made them crave bitcoins all the more! I mean, when we made the original donations, Bitcoins were only at 6 cents each. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!!Me very excite!! Some cool stats at:http://www.sharenator.com/w/bitcoin.orgLooks like the Russians are particularly interested. I'm guessing it's because they're both highly technological and also have experienced immense monetary corruption under the government there. Trading partner found, thanks! Liberal as in classical liberal, correct? The left kind of stole the term liberal... I don't have a Koan for you but I can tell you a joke.Three men are waiting for an interview. The first is called in. The interviewer learns that the first man is a mathematician. As the interview is wrapping up, the inerviewer says "Now before you go, I have one last question. What's 1+1?". "Exactly 2" says the mathematician. Next, the interviewer calls in the second man, who is an engineer. Towards the end of the interview, again, he says "One last question. What's 1+1?". "Well..." says the engineer "that depends on the accuracy of the original measurement. So I'd say around 2, plus or minus some amount of error".Finally, the interviewer calls in the third man, who is a lawyer. Again, at the end of the interview, he asks "One final question - what's 1+1?". The lawyer gets up from his seat and goes over the nearby window and closes the shades. He sits back down, and looks plainly into the interviewer's eyes: "What do you want it to be?" +1Government is pure evil.The more I use Bitcoin the more the idea of using fiat money makes me physically sick. Honestly one day I hope I can completely get out of the government's coercion-based money system and solely use something like Bitcoin.It is the most freedom I have ever experienced... quite a rush, really, to do business in Bitcoin. Nothing quite like listening to the QE2 talks on CNBC, the taxation talks, the national debt, etc etc... and knowing... some small part of me is now safe from all that violence, safe from the majority and their whims of fancy, safe from the predation of government goons... such an amazing feeling.It's small but it's something. Bitcoin is precious. PM me if interested, thanks Whoa Macho, you totally hijacked my thread ...The best thing about Bitcoin is that it is indifferent to your opinions, or mine, or anyone else's... that's why it's so wonderful. It's 100% voluntary. Unlike the USD, which is subject to Bernanke's every whim. If anything, the Bitcoin community is the anti-Fed, anti-Wall Street, anti-monetary centralization. It is not here to rip anyone off like fiat currency, Bitcoin just IS. What is there not to like? LOL, honestly I just re-read my post here and now I'm thinking it's really irrelevant, it's like someone complaining about the way the Earth rotates around the Sun.Financial markets will always behave the way they do, that is, insanely. Hopefully longer-term Bitcoin will increase its stability, so people can still speculate to their hearts content, but they'll do so with more leverage for smaller moves (like FOREX) so that it doesn't affect business.So, IMO, the problem will solve itself in the long run. Case closed for me on this issue. Definitely an opinion, I don't dispute you on that . My general point is that a quick 6X rise followed by a 50% crash is definitely a market overheated by speculation. The technical analysis guy posted nearly 100% bulls on bitcoin near the recent top.That said, I absolutely agree with you that some of that rise is probably very real and based on fundamentals and business adoption, so to an extent I didn't really phrase my opinion fully -- it's a mixture, so we're not exactly in disagreement here (I'm not claiming 100% speculation is where the volume is coming from), but rather that obviously there's a LOT of it going on, and that Bitcoin it nowhere near stable. As to what the ratio of fundamental vs speculative juices are, nobody knows. I think this week's 50% crash should answer your question. Bitcoin is extremely volatile, and like any financial asset, has the potential to experience bubbles. I think we've just burst our first mini-bubble (50 cents down to 23 cents is a huge move for anyone wanting to use Bitcoin as a paypal substitute!)This doesn't mean Bitcoin won't continue to go up in the long run -- I strongly believe the long-term trend is up for fundamental reasons -- but I certainly could feel the "froth" of excitement on the forums lately. Psychology is at work here as much as fundamentals.I have nothing against speculation, and I certainly believe attempts to curtail it do more harm than good. I'm just warning, from personal experience, that business is way, way better and more long-term profitable than speculation, and that I greatly would prefer stability to volatility in my choice of cryptocurrency.Is an increase in stability possible while keeping everything voluntary? Yes. The only way is if we continue to focus on using it as a currency. Speculators will be speculators, but the rest of us need to keep our heads and continue to push Bitcoin businesses. Monetization (usage as currency, rather than investment) always increases stability -- just like gold used to be more stable when it was used as currency rather than as a commodity investment like it is today. Exactly. My general point is that most of the recent activity has been due to an increase in speculation rather than huge inroads into business. I think that business inroads will increase the stability of Bitcoin.Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that my coins have increased 6X in value in the past two months, but at the same time doing business with something with that insane level of volatility is difficult to say the least. Maybe Bitcoin businesses should peg to the dollar 
The recent hubbub about the Bitcoin rally actually makes me nervous. I don't want Bitcoin to be a beanie-baby style bubble. I want it to make inroads into business and liberate people from the burdens of paypal and the dangers of our instable government-run banking system.Naturally I'm very happy that my holdings have increased in value, as I'm sure other Bitcoiners are, but I don't want the BTC community to lose focus of the long-term goals here based on the recent rally. It feels like a few months ago bitcoin was a "stable currency", and now it's an "investment". Not a good label IMO, and it worries me. I have friends now that are asking me how to get into bitcoin, not because they want to use the currency in any way, but simply because "it's going up!", and they want to flip it for a USD profit (that is, they think of it as a commodity I guess). These types of people are also going to be the ones that will also panic sell if "it goes down!". Bitcoin has become FOREX now, bah ...Maybe I just worry for nothing  Is it just my connection or is BiddingPond down? True. Buying or selling Bitcoins used to be easy back when they were 6 cents each a few months ago (I bought some on mtgox using a credit card, took about 2 minutes). Now it's essentially impossible to buy them.Of course, this means there's a big opportunity for someone who can solve the problem. Some good general advise here: http://www.harrybrowne.org/articles/InvestmentRules.htmLove this guy. What's the best way to invest? Wall St won't tell you the secret, but here it is: don't. Find a good money market fund as your base, and clip coupons by building a high quality relatively short duration bond ladder. It's essentially risk free, and it has beaten the market for over a decade now. Sleep well, save well, focus on your career, and enjoy your life -- and though you may not believe me, I guarantee you'll beat 95% of all investors in the long run, and you won't have to pay any "advisors" a nickel. Spinal Tap? I actually am one of the few who believes that the USD is near to a major rally, so I'm wondering if that might have a slight bearish effect on Bitcoins relative to the USD. We aren't there yet though, but we'll just have to see if such a rally occurs how BTC reacts.My thinking, however, is that the phenomina may be unrelated. Many assets go down when the USD goes up (and vice versa), but I think that's primarily due to the deleveraging/releveraging process. Nobody is borrowing USD to lever-up on Bitcoins, so I don't think they would be effected that greatly by a increase in dollar value.The best argument for a long-term Bitcoin rally is actually fundamental. 21M Bitcoins is a very limited supply, so it doesn't take a huge amount of market penetration to revalue them much, much higher than today. Of course, like any market, it will be a rollar-coaster ride along the way.So in conclusion I'm extremely bullish on BTC long term, but over the shorter term (a few months perhaps?), I'm waiting for some sort of a USD rally here just to see if there's any correlation at all with Bitcoin valuation.What I'd really love to see is some momentum indicators on the charts to help time buy-ins  Okay, I ran into him and gave him a copy of my article (http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/09/bitcoin-electronic-currency-future-of.html).No clue if he even read it, but at least it was an attempt. I put together some of my favorite freedom quotes w/ some home-brewed music:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jptmJO674fYIf you have any favorite freedom quotes, reply away! Enjoy.(Note: for hardcore anarchist, capitalist, agorist, voluntaryist, libertarian eyes only ... ) I'm actually going to an investment conference in New Orleans (http://www.neworleansconference.com/) this week. If I get a chance to speak to Peter Schiff then I'll be sure to mention Bitcoin to him! I've also contacted him about Bitcoin, but he seems to be pretty busy.I also don't think he really cares that much about money because he made a fortune as a software entrepreneur before becoming a full-time philosopher.But I think he would like the *ideas* behind Bitcoin. Maybe ask Satoshi to do an interview with him? Btw, the reason it took so long way due to the difficulty of deciding if they wanted to be accepting anonymous donations via Bitcoin or not. Looks like they decided yes, even if they put it in a "less formal" donation area. GREAT NEWS!!I heard back today. Basically, they say that yes they got the account and that they're most likely going to liquidate the coins for USD through one of the exchanges.In addition, they also said:"Once all the logistics are squared away, we plan to place this on our Ways to Help page and notify our social networks. At this time, it isn't possible to integrate it with our membership donation forms.  Thanks for taking the time to contact us again and for everyone's generosity!"So it looks like they're going to post a Bitcoin donation address in their "Ways to Help" page!YaHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Please remove these names immediately. Maybe someone else should try? Nothing, no response Okay, I sent a brief follow-up today."Hi [name omitted]! I haven't heard back from you so I wanted to do a quick follow-up. Did you managed to get control of the mybitcoin account? Thanks,[BrightAnarchist]"I'll let you know if I hear back. Ultimatum? I don't understand ... In the future we should not do donations in this manner. We should request that they put up a donation box, and say that IF they do this then and only then will we donate coins.In any event, I'm going to go ahead and send some sort of follow up to the EFF this weekend. Another good one:"The Money That Is Sold Abroad Is You!"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd-SLRyuRq0
Makes sense. What do you say -- wait 1 week and then ask?Apparently I'm incapable of making an independent decision. The fact is, if we don't get a response within the next week ... or 2 weeks at the most ... I mean, at some point we need to follow up, right?I just need to figure out what to ask. Also, you can't pay a lady by stuffing a Bitcoin between her breasts Sorry about that Edit: this post used to contain the email thread, but I removed it for EFF's privacy. The only "verification" you have is Kiba and I's word that we were involved in an email thread with one of the heads of the EFF where we gave them the account information.If you have any ideas on how we can get the EFF to prove that they recieved the funds, I'm definitely game.If you want I will post the entire email thread here and just block out the names. Yes, we replied and they definitely understand that they can exchange their BTC for USD. For those that remember, I got my Bitcoin article published this month @ elliottwave.comIn any event, it has had the effect of drawing some new users to btc. I also got this email recently in response to it:"I found the info on Bitcoin rather interesting!  Can you please give me the contact info for Satoshi Nakamoto of Bitcoin?Thanks!Stephen Lange RanziniPresident & CEOUniversity Bank*Ann Arbor, MI USA"2 things:1) What is Satoshi's email? I should put the two in contact.2) Also, who is the Bitcoin blogger? I would like to get my article re-posted there to help it circulate the net. Should I follow up with the EFF? What do I ask? 1) 2015 ~ 20162) < 3,0003) > 20% Mises.org is a lost cause for BTC support IMO. They refuse to run Bitcoin articles because they don't want to "promote" it. Very true. Here's some relevant reading: http://www.autotelic.com/windows_is_freeOne of the biggest (unknown?) enemies of OSS is piracy...Great arguments as well for how piracy actually *helps* proprietary software I'm not yet sold on the against-IP argument yet. I understand the scarce vs. non-scarce goods anti-IP argument that many libertarians are taking these days, but IMO it fails as soon as you say it voids private contracts. Disallowing individuals to enter into private contracts is obviously immoral, and yet some libertarians are arguing exactly that when they argue against IP. What's wrong with me selling you a reproducible good with a contract attached that says you agree not to duplicate it? If you do, it's dishonest and you've violated our contract.That said, I dislike the totalitarian nature of government enforcement of IP, which is an entirely different story. Since modern IP is enforced using government this removes an important component of the price mechanism from the equation, and so modern IP is really just fantasy in the sense that all government-sponsored economic behavior is fantasy. Why should my labor (via taxes) fund the enforcement that is used to protect someone elses contract, without my consent? This is just as immoral as the contract violations themselves in my opinion, and distorts the market and human behavior  in short, the costs of IP are socialized while the benefits are capitalized upon by a few. (Just like our banking systemlol) Instead, if those who entered into contracts assumed the cost of enforcement, youd see a dramatically different landscape and the emergence of ingenious methods of protecting contracts and IP without using the extreme expense of government enforcement. As Ayn Rand says, the moral is the practical, and I have no doubt that natural market equilibrium in a voluntaryist society would be far more efficient and just than taking a hard statist stance either for or against IP. I strongly dislike violence/coercive solutions (such as government sueing you for piracy), rather than peaceful ones (such as your ISP cutting off your internet because you had a third strike pirating from one of their business partners, who pays them a fee perhaps for this service, and its all part of your voluntary contract with your ISP, etc). The voluntary solution strongly favors the usage of reputation systems over direct violent enforcement, and IMO is always better. Who knows? Maybe internet access itself would be completely free is it was completely paid for with a share of IP holders profits from the sale of their digital media through the IP-enforced ISP. People who want to ignore IP, of course, would be free to pay for the non-IP enforced ISP.But my point is quite broad really, which is basically that people should look to voluntary solutions rather than everyone lining up at the governments door to enact new laws. Getting stuck in the pro-IP/anti-IP legal debate is a very, very statist mindset, since it assumes that the government must either enforce for it or enforce against it -- how about get the gov't out of the way and let people figure it out! Some of the anti-IP crowd is even more statist than the pro-IP crowd: read about Swedens proposal to legalize piracy (thus voiding private contracts), tax all internet traffic and have the government decide how to hand out money to content creators. that is frightening and insane IMO. +1 This is definitely true. I contacted Mises.org about publishing my Bitcoin article. Of course, they rejected it because they said it would "appear to be a promotion". I think they're worried about the legal ramifications of it.I guess Mises is too academic anyway. Best to spread the word to other groups that would be more willing to endorse it.Actually endorsement/smorshment... what we really need is killer apps for bitcoin. The facebook micro-payment idea really is one of the best things I've seen so far to drive users to Bitcoin, making our "stock" go up  *Checks emal* No, still nothing.Btw, I'm not sure if they feel the need to reply and say anything. I mean, I didn't specifically request a reply as in "please tell me what your plans are". I just left it on their plate.But I agree that I'm dying, just as you are, wondering if they're going to post a Bitcoin donation box on their website or not. They may not even know yet -- maybe they're talking about it, or maybe they just want to liquidate the coins.Any ideas on the course of action at this point? Should I wait a month, and if they don't post one, then ask specifically what their plans are? I feel that we've done everything possible to enourage them, so any additional bugging would just be bothersome. LOL, nope  No, nothing yet. Bah .... I send him a facebook message about it a while ago, and he never did respond. Maybe I'll try again via a different approach. It would really be great to have him talk about it on his radio show. Bitcoin clients should have a built in simple message encryption/decryption system, perhaps based off of your actual Bitcoin addresses themselves.This would make doing trades on sites like biddingpond much easier, since you don't need to both agree on a separate app like PGP before communicating over email.Most of the time I bet people don't even bother to use encryption, but I think it's a good idea to use it when doing trades in Bitcoins.Thoughts?
I've had this idea for a while, but I'm probalby too lazy to implement it anyway. So I might as well put the idea out there for others to muse over.Derivatives trading denominated in bitcoins. Futures, options, or entirely new types of contracts.Obviously, we're not at the point where we can buy real stocks or bonds with BTC, but I don't see any reason why we cannot trade derivatives off of these instruments.The only problem is that the market for BTC derivatives probably won't be very liquid, at least initially. Done."I hope you decide to offer a bitcoin donation address on your website. There are many more people who haved pledged additional coins if this is offerred, and it provides a convenient method for future bitcoin donations. Thanks, and let me know if you have any problems with the account!"If I hear back that they're actually going to do this, of course, I'll post and let you know! Okay cool, in that case I'll follow up and mention that there are more coins coming their way if the publish a bitcoin donation address on their website. Sweet! Did you ask if they would post an address on their website for future bitcoin donations?I haven't asked this yet and don't want to annoy if you already asked. It's taken care of... kiba is continuing this thread and is going to send them a username/password so they can get their donations.I haven't yet mentioned anything about having them setup a donations page yet... I think I'll wait until Kiba confirms that they have successfully recieved their coins. Once they're happy with the donation, I'll mention that there are more donations to come if they put up an official bitcoin donation box on their website. I will pledge 10 BTC if EFF sets up a bitcoin donation button on their website. Um, yeah it's a private email thread so it wouldn't be nice to post it publicly without asking permission.All they need now is the username and password for the account. If you send me your email then I can introduce you into the conversation. You can then drop me and forward them the info privately.I can handle the rest of communication with the EFF, such as recommending that they setup a donation area on their website, etc, but you need to send the account info yourself since you're the account trustee. Also, Kiba, please go ahead and post some Bitcoin addresses here for the EFF MyBitcoin account so we can all donate to it.Great news: The EFF is definitely interested in recieving Bitcoins! Kiba -- please send me your email address ASAP using the forum personal message system. I'm in talks now to get this setup for the EFF and I need to loop you into the conversation. I sent an email and am now playing the waiting game. Hey FreeMoney -- can you vouch for MyBitcoin? It looks like a pretty handy service. However, I'm curious as to how well backed up the coins are. I back up my wallet in several locations after each transaction. I wonder if MyBitcoin has an intelligent backup system... what happens if I use myBitcoin and the server's HD dies? I might be able to help with this. I have a personal contact at the EFF. I will write a letter. No promises though. 3 days left to bid! Selling for only a *quarter* of its dollar value.http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=20 Right, but no networked friendship / reputation system based off of this. My thinking is that it would operate similiarly to bitcoin -- each user would have a little client app that they run which stores a database for public key/name pairs (for the users). To friend another user, you simply broadcast a "friendship link" from your public key to theirs signed with your private key, and then everyone updates their database. Sorry dude, no way! It must be decentralized. That's the key to keeping the system alive for eternity since it would be an extremely important component to a crypto-anarchist network. What if I wanted to use my internet name "BrightAnarchist" widely in trade, to protect my state-sanctioned identity? The trust accumulated through the usage of my internet name is real and helps greatly for trade -- for example, if people recognize "BrightAnarchist" and know that he's "trustworthy", then I've built up a useful asset (trust) into an alias. I can then sell things on biddingpond and people will trust me, and a reputation builds up. My thinking is, what if I could register this alias with a public/private key pair, so that when I post on this forum -- or other websites -- everyone knows that this is the *same* BrightAnarchist that you already trust? Basically, the idea is that a name could be registered somehow with a public key and shared over a P2P network. Then, when you browse the net, forum posts (etc) could include a signature by the poster than you could verify with their public key. That way, I'm the *real* BrightAnarchist that you already trust.Then, similar to facebook, each person could build a web of trust. By including another person in their own web (a "friend", but it would really be more like a "trustworthy/honest trader"), you could gain access to "second tier" trustworthy people. Basically, people that BrightAnarchist believes are trustyworth.This type of system could certainly help when trading. You could even dynamically view a "Trust distance" to your own friends (that is, is this person a friend of one of my friends, or is this person 3 people away, etc).This system wouldn't be reliant on actual scores or any centralized system. It would be distributed and anonymous. "Trustbook" or something like that  I doubt it.If someone from here was willing to do an interview, I know he loves doing those on his radio show.Regardless, I'll send him some articles in the meantime.... Oh man, I second that bit about "we're actually trying". Even though I love Von Mises, it seems that violence, and hence the capacity for government, will *always* exist: there will always be those who wish to enslave others for their own ends.I've thus come to believe that the *only* way to achieve a non-violent and truely voluntary society is to have exceptional personal defense against the aggression of others. Once I was thinking about writing a sci-fi book with the premise that the invention of cheap and mass produced powerful defensive energy shields would lead at once to a completely voluntary society. Now, in real life, Bitcoin *is* that shield -- or at least as close as we can get thus far in terms of present technology. It greatly reaffirms my believe that freedom will, in the long run, win the battle against force.Maybe we need a "Bitcoin philosophy" section on the forums for these types of discussions... That would be awesome, but we'd need some sort of agenda that makes it worthwhile. Maybe this will take off once Bitcoin matures a bit more and there are sufficient reasons for a conference.If you're interesting in voluntaryst/anarchist type of conferences, there are already plenty of those each year: http://freedomainradio.com/
