Hi all! I'm still around but I haven't found time to reopen Apophenia. I still do some work on Biticker and Bittit.info and I still want to start a new version of Apophenia (sort of a rewrite) but I need to sort out some legal stuff first.(which btw is why i'm keeping the domain around but I let the certificate expire   ) It'll be back. I had an issue with my server so I decided to use the opportunity to upgrade my OS and clean up a bit but I didn't have time to restore all my services yet. I still need to bring back bittit.info and Biticker and then it's apophenia's turn... Sorry!   It's on purpose. The x4 pot wasn't but since I took it down I didn't feel like putting just the regular pot so instead I went for x2 the regular. :-) Argh... It looks like a background service had crashed for some time now and it failed to restart. I may have to cancel this one since it has become pretty clear already (no bets on it yet thankfully). I'll put up a new one in a few minutes. I though I had replied to that question via my phone's browser but I must have mis-tapped on something. It wouldn't push it out. It would wait in the very first place until it was solved. :-)Here's the new picture:The winning payment for the previous one will be sent in a few hours. Sorry for the delay on that. Why not? :-) I thought I'd run two in parallel, one of them very long lasting. The short one got solved, I will replace it in a little while. And one more:   Here's the latest one.   Yeah of course. Just go on the website, click on the solved picture's thumbnail and then click again on the full size picture. It'll show you the clear version. Here's the latest one:Good job on the last one btw. I didn't expect someone to hit the bath salts solution before the letters were visible... "Slipper" was also a possible answer btw. :-) Yeap, almost found that. :-)Here's the new picture btw:Have fun! Don't overthink the new hint. I hadn't done a "no hint" picture for some time, so I thought I'd help new players by mentioning a couple more of other categories to help them understand that it could really be anything. :-) Either my own photos or screenshots from movies TV series etc. Generally it's not stuff that you can google image search. :-)Would it be unfair if I put a hint on this one now? Given that some people have already answered I mean. I would say that it wouldn't, since all people would be helped by it but at the same time, people who saw the "No hint!!!" are less likely to look at the hint box again so they might miss it. But I'd really like to help a bit more... :-( Maybe I can put it an add an alert to notify all players of the new hint.[EDIT] OK I did that. So everyone will be aware of the hint now. Yeap I want to do that too actually.Here's something different:No hint this time! Could be item/person/title or even anything else. Thank you!Yes it's a pain sometimes. How detailed an answer is, is such an subjective thing so it's sort of expected that I will fail to always agree with the player-base in whether something was too detailed or not. Here's how I try to think: I generally try to take synonyms from wikipedia and such. And then I may add some even simpler ones. So for example in some other cases the equivalent of just "planner" could have been added, depending on whether I think it's too general. Wikipedia helps a lot because if often lists USA, British or Australian variants that I've never heard of.So basically here's two examples:Not enough info: plant   /    planner, pagesCorrect answers: aloe, aloe plant, aloe vera plant  /   daily planner, personal planner, year planner, agendaToo much info: plant in pot, aloe in pot   /   open agenda, empty agendaIn the case of chips as I said I would like to have had added more correct answers though.You know, I might actually add a tip on the answer form that says "Check wikipedia" because I often use it to find synonyms or alternatives. Don't take this as a rule though. It doesn't HAVE to be from wikipedia.dayplanner would have been wrong, it's not a proper word I think. "day-planner" would have been converted to "day planner" and accepted though. Pretty sure I remove dashes and other symbols from answers.Doesn't mean anything useful really. It's the SHA256 of the input file (the picture that was not black and white). I could start publishing those pictures but it wouldn't make anything provably fair. It would simply prove that I had this picture all along. It wouldn't prove that the processed versions are based on that picture from the start and it would certainly not prove that I don't cheat by giving the correct answers to a "friend" or that I don't play myself. Unfortunately I don't think the last point can be ever provably fair. Someone had suggested that I fix the first point and make it provable that the distorted images are based on the same image that you see "clearly" at the end. That could probably be done in a few ways but the possibility of me cheating sort of makes that feature useless. If I wanted to cheat I would cheat directly, no real point in me just making the game harder for legit players by changing pictures behind the scenes. What would that accomplish? Players can actually detect that if they for example store the picture every 15 minutes or so so that they get the whole series of changes and review them later.   (PS: You will not be able to find my pictures on the internet by searching for the SHA) Here's the latest one: Looks like I didn't see all the posts here. I'll read through them and answer after I take some sleep! Here's the new one then! Welcome back! Adding a picture in a few minutes!Yeap. You can see the other correct answers if you click on the picture now. They are listed. As I said I wish I had added french fry but for some reason I didn't think of it at the time. Nevertheless I'm not comfortable adding answers afterwards unless the correct ones were... wrong.   Yes... I hate it when this happens...   I have typed in 4 answers for this picture and obviously nobody has bet on one of those yet. I'm watching what players are betting though and to be honest I wish I had included some of these answers as correct ones. But as I've said in the past often there are answers that fit the picture but are not accepted as correct (either because I didn't think of that variation when I was typing the correct answers in or simply because there were too many variations to list. Sometimes I overdo it and add tons of correct answers. Other times I just add a few (like in this instance). I can't say much more for now without giving out clues.(Just FYI: If this picture expires without a solution, the pot (excluding the starting pot) will be transferred to the next picture, it doesn't go to the website. This has happened maybe 2-3 times in the past.) Thank you Fravia. :-)Here's the newest one:Also congrats on whoever solved the coins picture. I think I forgot to post that one here good job. :-) EDIT: Oh it looks like I did post it here.
Here's the latest one:Also the previous one was quite easy by the time it got solved I think: I expected the cat to be solved a bit earlier... :-SHere's a new one: Here's the latest one! Should be getting easy in the next 24 hours or so. Although I could be quite biased. :-) That one was solved. It's a squirrel! :-) A painted one.Ha that was a typo. But I'll leave it as it is! I will increase the hours though somewhat (it'll still be more reward/day though)(to clarify, the pot was a typo, not the hint) What's this? The latest one is clearing up a bit I think: OK the winner has been paid and I refunded the bets of the next two answers (I included the fee I believe too). Please tell me if I missed something (although it's pretty much automated)Here's the new one:This time the answer is right. :-) Sorry people for the mess. I was traveling and just noticed this. I obviously typed in the wrong answer. I will start refunding the appropriate people in a few minutes and award the first one that actually answered correctly...  EDIT: Just read through a few more of the posts here. Aw I feel so bad for scrambling your brains... :-( The short term plan is to not forget to check my emails because I forgot to post a picture for a few days! :-) Here's a new picture btw which is going for a couple of days:Long term plans: I hope to find some time to work on this and make a "Versus" play-style as described in some posts above. It could be during the Xmass holidays, who knows.  And this is the current one! Not that hard anymore... @ranlo: you were close but incorrect. ;-)The last picture was very easy when it got solved I think. I was expecting it to get solved way earlier... Take a look:The last one on the other hand is still hard but let see if someone will be able to guess the answer earlier than I expect: I think I've been using the same starting pot amount on all pics the past few months. If you saw a pic with a higher one it's probably because someone tried an answer on it (part of the bet gets added to the bounty).Well compare it with other hints like "Who is that?" or "Need the title." and this one ("what is this?") means that it's an object, animal, place. It's definitely not the name of a movie, game or person that I am looking for. :-)Unfortunally I still haven't made much progress with the new mode. I've made detailed plans (database schema, API endpoints needed etc) but I haven't found much time to work on it yet.I don't post better quality pictures, instead the pictures improve over time. If you click on a picture it will say how many hours are left. As this hour decrease towards zero, the picture become more and more clear, at some point turning into a black and white version of the original picture. The pictures refresh every 15-30 minutes to be specific.BTW the latest picture is this one:  Wow I somehow missed the conversation here over the past days. I'll read through it in the afternoon and answer any questions. Latest pic is this: Not exactly.For each challenge I put from my wallet a starting pot.People have to bet to place answers.About 60% of their bet goes to the pot, the other 40% goes to my wallet.When someone gets the answer right, the whole pot (the starting pot + those 60% of each bet places till then) gets sent to the winner.Also the starting pot is 4 times the bet.So to math it up:B = betS = starting potS=4*BAfter X bets my earnings are:X*B*40%And I've already paid for the starting pot:4*BSo to break even for a picture I need:X*B*40%=4*BX*40%=4X*0.4=4X=4/0.4X=10I need 10 bets to be placed just to get back my money that I lost for the starting pot.For each bet after the 10th, i'm making a profit.Of course there are a few more factors that you need to take into account but they are trivial. For example I give out 5% of my earnings to the referral of the winner. So I don't get to keep exactly 40% of the bets. But on the other hand I earn some money from ads etc. And I also loose some money for the domain and the certificate so I guess it's quite more complex but in any case I consider 10 bets to be my break even point. :-)You can read the ToS, Fees and the other help sections if you'd like to learn more. Or just ask of course. Well, I don't make profit from it, yet. If I start making profit I will obviously stop advertising this as >150% RTP. :-) Now if the question is why I keep doing it, it's for a few reasons:1. I think that if I can attract more people to it, it will start making a profit so it's worth loosing some money now rather than letting it die. The break even point for a challenge is something like 8-12 bets if I remember correctly. If more than these many bets are places, I'm making a profit from this picture.2. My losses are not big, I can definitely cover them. I mean paying for my server is more expensive than what I loose for prizes in Apophenia so it's OK.3. Ads cover a (small) part of the costs.4. Ideas like the one in the posts above, when implemented will cut my losses.Actually, that's not true. In the very rare cases when a picture was not solved, the remaining money in the pot is transfered to the starting pot of the next challenge. This is stated in my ToS/Fees I believe. Well I should add more pictures instead of picking up the pace actually because I've had complaints about the picture getting clear while someone is sleeping etc.Yeah, the could take turns guessing and the picture gets slightly clearer after each guess. Maybe give them maximum 24 hours to make a guess or they loose it. Maybe they loose their turn twice if they delay. And maybe they could have the option to pass their turn once every two turns or something. Yeah I can work on that!Regarding the more real-time I'm a bit hesitant to force it into a real time game. What I propose above could turn into real-time if both players want to though. ;-) What do you think? Fixed a couple of failing altcoins today, removed mincoin cause I can't find a proper place to get its exchange rate from and added Singapore dollar after a user request. The new version should be up shortly. Please tell me if I'm missing some fancy new altcoin that you'd like to be added. :-)(@Felix: not sure how you want me to add hitbtc. It's not a different currency so I don't know what's there to add. I could add it to the BTC average price that I'm calculating but it's not that high volume yet I think, is it?) The programming/math puzzles idea is nice although it's quite different from what apophenia is so it would probably be a sister website. It's more hard to create those puzzles and the betting model would also need to be different most likely. I'll give it some thought... ;-)The last one shouldn't be too hard I think btw, that's why I left it hintless. :-) It will get clear soon enough.Here's the picture btw: The site is active although I usually process/approve pictures and files in big batches because I don't always have the time. :-) I'll respond to your PM in a moment.
The transaction with your reward has been sent to the network so you should be able to see it in your wallet by now. Give it a little time and it should get confirm by the network since it even includes a normal fee.  This is getting easier I think...  I could but how would it work? Have a 3D anaglyph of some word, add some noise to it, convert that into a autostereogram and have people guess what the word is? Well the thing is that there are programs that can extract the 3D anaglyph from autostereograms (I've made one actually) so the whole autostereogram thing goes out of the window as a way to make it more challenging since people can cheat it out of the puzzle... ;-) Ah those are called autostereograms. I love them too. :-) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutostereogramOh and new picture:This time I need the title! Thank you BigMac. ^^^ That's ^^^ exactly the process, grendel25, feel free to PM me any questions if you'd like. The current one is hint-less! Yeah you were unlucky there. Didn't think to add "digital clock". The correct answers were: "alarm clock" / "clock" / "digital alarm" / "digital alarm clock"The person who won bet on the "alarm clock" answer actually, not just "clock". Although even simply "clock" would win... Here's the current one: In case you missed this one. :-) Here's the new one! Here's the new one! Well it will be possible soon. :-) No I have never changed my username. Here's the latest one! Thank you! You don't have bet for the picture to get more clear. It improves on it own pace. If you click on each picture on the website you can see how many hours are needed for the picture to fully clear.  Here's the current pic. :-) The picture will get more clear as time passes. So just keep an eye on it. :-) Here's the current pic:What does the text say? Hey the forum is back..!Well this answer has been given already but it's not the one that i'm looking for. I can't give specific hint right now but the hints I would give have already been given by me for other pictures in the past. :-) Here's the current challenge:What's this? I never ask people to be THAT precise. :-) Just falls would be enough. (although it's not the Dunn River Falls but it doesn't matter as long as you saw that it is a waterfall)
And another one!What's this? The dental floss took some time to get solved.Here's another one!What's this? Here's the new one:What's this? Now that was fast! Need to upload a new one... Let's see.... Sorry for the huge delay but apparently bitcoin needs ages to sync nowadays. :-D Bets are open again. I will also upload a second picture in a few hours. What's this? Also note that the site might be offline for an hour or so, later today for some scheduled maintenance.EDIT: Unfortunately it will take WAY longer than an hour. It'll probably be off for a day. :-( What's this?(BTW I didn't post the last one here, it was the picture of a glove, looked pretty easy when I got solved. :-) ) I'm sorry for the delay. Here's a new challenge:EDIT: Ooops wrong challenge. Fixed it. :-) I had to remove the currently active picture because I doubted that anyone would be able to solve it unless I zoomed it some more in. So I zoomed on the "subject" of the picture and reuploaded it.There was a single bet in the last version of the picture which got refunded to the player.Sorry for the inconvenience.Here it is btw: Oh and this one is still open: Thanks dukeneptun. :-)Here's the latest pic:What's this? Shouldn't take much longer I guess.   Well... I bet that if you look at the archived old challenges (https://apopheniabtc.com/?archive=1) you will find quite a few that you could easily solve maybe an hour before they got actually solved. :-)So just keep the game open in a tab and take a look every now and then. Also if you read through this thread you might find some tips on how to improve your chances. The umbrella one also took more time than I thought!Here's the one that's open right now: Ha I didn't think of this.  BTW I was thinking if it would make sense to make a chatroom about this. Either something like a shoutbox visible on the website or an actual IRC room with a link using kiwiIRC on the website itself. The latter will open a new page of course. Yes, it is. Just go to apopheniabtc.com too see what challenge is currently open, to read the terms, to see answers submitted by other players and to place your own bet on some answer.It's OK to post answers and thoughts here but keep in mind that you may be helping someone else to win. ;-)  It's shrimp. This one has been solved already and you can view the answers on the website. :-) I don't think I've posted this one here:Should be getting easy soon...   The last one took way longer than I thought to get solved.  Well. Here's a new one: Oooops. My bad. Must have mistyped the starting pot there... :-( Thanks for pointing this out.I wouldn't say this one is more challenging really. MAYBE a little above average. Wow that's fascinating. I would love you to tell me if you come up with anything although I would try to fix it so maybe it would make sense for you to keep it to yourself at least for a while... :-) It's not against the rules to use tools to clear up the picture but the kind of deformation I'm using should be really hard to even partially reverse. If at all possible. I think that you won't be able to get more info about he picture than when you simply squeeze your eyes.You were right.Basically the last one has been solved but the website is waiting for the first confirmation to actually accept the answer. 
 A car? No... If you go to the website you can open up the pic in full size and then if you click on it again, it will show you the picture completely clear so you can see that it has nothing to do with a car. Done. :-) Well just stick around the webpage. If you leave the tab open it autorefreshes every 10minutes (about the same time as the server-side refreshing of the pictures) Now how you're going to remember to check the page a few times per hour.... I don't know... :-D I've got an AutoIt script that brings any window on top every X minutes, if someone's interested in running it I can paste the source code here. Haven't done a "Who's that?" for some time.   Thanks D!ABLO.Here's a new pic:What's this?? This one took way longer than I expected to get solved. :-) Someone did bet on "singer songstress woman with microphone"   but never paid for it. Made me chuckle. :-DHere's a new one:What does the text say?@unamis76: Well, you were correct at what you saw but not as precise as I wanted in your answer. :-) Good luck on your next one if you decide to try again! This one is still unsolved:@unamis76 Which one was your answer? tv antenna? Someone nailed it after three tries in a row! But the pot was worth the multiple tries. :-) Was it you michinzx?There is one more open picture on the website. I prescribe 4 hours x 3 days of Descent. Once you are able to handle that, there are no graphics in the world that can give you a headache. ;-) Well... I can't give hints. :-) Someone had suggested paid hints but I'm afraid it will enrage the players who don't pay for them. :-D Last one hasn't been solved yet... Weird.Here's a new one too: Glad you appreciate the game. :-)Here's what was the last one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_HanoiAnd here's a new pic: Here's the currently running one:What's this? Thanks! Good luck guessing this one! :-) This one is still running:  *bump* The last one was easy huh? :-)Here's a new one: New one is running for a day or so: Congrats to whoever found the space heater. :-)This one's already running:
Thanks! Lurk around and you'll get something eventually. ;-) And before the last one gets solved:What's this? Back to something that doesn't require any knowledge to solve:What does the text say?? Haha, to be honest I don't remembe the answer to this one. But I do remember what it shows. :-) This one is quite clear already: Now let's get back to guessing the person:  New one before the last one gets solved: *bump*Nobody selling sex toys for Bitcoin? :-) The images get less and less blurry as time passes.There are usually one or two unsolved images. Oopsy. That was a mistake. I'll take the current pic down because it will be a massacre sudden death if I enable it now and upload another one with a bigger pot to make up for this.   New pic will be up in 10 min.EDIT: New pic is up! This might be more helpful actually... According to awstats, during November I had:5,772 unique visitors8,382 visits23,966 pages loadedYou should note though that each person that solves the questionnaire stays for hours at the website reading through a list of questions and visiting external information links for some them. Hello everyone.I operate http://sexionnaire.com which is a huge questionnaire for heterosexual couples aiming to help them discover common fetishes and give new ideas to try.Currently a bit less than 10 couples per day fill in the questionnaire, a process which takes more than one hour for each partner (actually it's more than 2 for most people but you can do it in 1 if you know everything).Right now I use anonymous ads but I was wondering if someone would like either to advertise directly on the website or if someone would like to sell sex toys, clothing, games, furniture or advertise some related website inside the questionnaire (in the "more info" links that accompany some questions).If someone is interested please contact me by PM or even by leaving a comment here and we'll discuss it. You can find the current questionnaire here.Thank you.PS: In the future I aim to create versions for homosexual couples but I don't have ETA for this. Indeed the website only refunds the portion that comes back to it but since I hadn't included any clause for tx fees in my ToS I'll happily refund the tx fee to you too. Just to confirm, I should send 0.0003 BTC to 1Af5E8xK6V4DYquMuFK7dE5Y26G565Usbz, correct? Hello Arogantx.Indeed someone had guessed what it was but he used a phrase which I hadn't added to the pool of correct answers, yet I decided to add it afterwards since it seemed unfair to me that he looses even though he basically saw what it was.I reset all bets after the winning one so refunds were sent. Refunds are send to the corresponding winning address though. Can you tell me either here or in a PM which of these transactions are your bets and check if you see your refunds too here? https://apopheniabtc.com/txs.phpThank you and sorry for the trouble. I just saw that someone had answered something ("key in lock") that I should have accepted so I added that answer as valid and refunded the bets after his winning bet. Wish I had thought about it. I thought that "keyhole" is also describing modern "keyholes" but whenever I do an image search it turns out showing those old locks... I'm not sure; don't we use the word keyhole for our door locks' "keyholes" nowadays? I use "lock" when refering to the whole mechanism not just the visible part where you slide your key in.In any case, here's a new one! New one:It's been going for a day or so. :-) Last one still going with a nice pot.  New one:  This one is pretty clear:And here's a new one! Indeed you are right. I copy pasted the title from some other website to avoid making a typo of my own but it looks like that site had a typo. Sorry about that, you should get your pot in a little while. Tell me if everything is OK then.Oh and new one:
Need the title! Ohhh, now it makes sense. :-) Why did someone bed "dates" in the last pic?  Here's a new one!Reminder: There is almost always a hint for the pic on the website. Sorry for that. Something crashed the server. It's back up now.And here's the latest pic:  Before the last one gets solved here's one more: Congrats on whoever solved the last one. I didn't expect it that soon to be honest. Here's more: I'm guessing some might not have seen this one:   And before the last one gets solved,what does the text say in this one? Here's another where I need the title: And here's a new one:   Who hasn't seen this? Soon...   This one's getting easier, me thinks. :-) And before the last one gets solved (it's getting easy), here's a new one too:Who's that? New one!Need the title...I didn't post about the previous one here. Did you miss it? If so, I am making an email notification system that you can subscribe to for new pictures. :-) New one.   Need the title again. Congrats to whoever found the last one! That was a big pot...So here's a movie/series/game one, it's been a while since we had one of those I think: Sorry people. I had accidentally turned on an option to block bets so I removed the last pic and uploaded a new one with the same pot. Nobody had placed a bet. I'm sorry for the trouble anyone trying to guess went through.The new pic is this: I think someone had written a javascript miner. If that's the case a modern phone should be able to run that miner. Of course you can't earn anything form this sort of mining...It wouldn't be hard to port a Java miner to Android either. But again, no reason to mine using such a device. You'll NEVER generate a single block in your lifetime I bet... It's a simple ethernet adapter. The pic is a bit streched though but you can see the 8 pins. Someone actually knew what it was but he wrote "network card" which is not one of the ten correct answers that I had typed in for it...
Although I suspect a temporary lack of funds, I've got to explain that you have to bet on an answer on the website and not here. Unless you do it for fun of course which is perfectly fine. :-) So the old pots gets transfered to the new pic which is also somewhat faster than the last ones: (and with a nice pot/bet ratio)What's this?In case this wasn't clear: Right now the pot is ~16x the bet. So if you think that you have a 1/15 chance of guessing correctly, go for it. (or don't go for it, I'm just pointing it out in case someone didn't notice the pot  ) I've said this in the past:An answer may be "correct" but not actually accepted as correct. Sometimes I'm putting in 10 correct answers into a picture but I miss 1 that someone happens to later bet on. I really can't predict every possible synonym for some things and if I would it would require typing >50 correct answers for each pic I upload. and I bet I would still miss something.So now that the picture is clear you should just make up your mind about what it is that you see and bet on ways to say it instead of guessing other stuff or overgeneralizing your guesses.More on that after this gets solved. I'll also update the how-to-play if possible. No that's a new one. I meant if it was you who found what the text says in the last one. :-) Were you the one who found it? :-) Just a heads up because it's about to get easy very fast... Here's a new one that carries a bonus pot from the expired one a few days ago: Hello Purple. Actually it has happened before a couple of times but I didn't expect to happen on this one. The movie is well known but I guess the screencap was a bit hard.   It turnes out this one expired with pot on it. The pot will be transfered to the next one since I've already posted one before it expired:This one shouldn't take that long I believe. Last one gathered a nice pot on it.Here's a new one (up since yesterday) in case you missed it on the site: New one is up!The hint is a little different for this one. Play on ApopheniaBTC. Currently it gives out more that it takes in. WAY more. It's way better than the best faucet... (see my signature for link) I can't believe how nobody has posted "tits or gtfo" yet... After 5 girl votes... Why would I want things to change? Cow milk... Who needs water. And before the last one gets solved here's another one too.   Quick and easy one. I'll pick up the pace starting today. Sure why not. Although I don't suppose I will ask for a scene since most don't have a "name"... :-) Last one took a while for you people to figure out.   Here's something else: Nobody noticed this or is it still hard?  
Back to Movies/Series/Games. Need the title! What's this?  I would say that it was solvable some hours before it was solved but I am always biased because I took the photo in the first place. There is always the chance that someone got lucky of course. Maybe he has the very same charger? Although, usually, it just clicks at some point and you recognize it. Now what is this? New pic. What's this? Good luck!Oh and please be patient while the final blocks are being downloaded. Might take another hour or so before your bet (and some other bets can get confirmed) The move to the new server has been completed but bitcoind is trying to catch up with the blockchain so I will stall the picture for a little while, making it last a little longer before it clears up. It should be getting pretty easy now. Oh by the way I will be moving my websites to a dedicated server very soon so hopefully no more downtime. New one!Need the title.(Shouldn't be very hard I think) Σωστά. Στην πράξη ή μόνη καθαρή μορφή καπιταλισμού είναι ο αναρχοκαπιταλισμός. Οτιδήποτε μη "αναρχο" προυποθέτει ένα κράτος. Το κράτος προυποθέτει σχεδόν σίγουρα φορολογία άρα τουλάχιστον μια μορφή βίαιας εισβολής στην ιδιοκτησία κάποιου. Άρα δεν έχεις 100% ελεύθερη αγορά αφού τουλάχιστον ένα group ατόμων έχει δικαίωμα να παίρνει βίαια και όχι μέσω τις αγοράς τα αγαθά που θέλει.Κατά την γνώμη μου και η μόνη πραγματική αναρχία είναι επίσης ο αναρχοκαπιταλισμός με libertarian νομοθεσία αλλά αυτό είναι άλλη συζήτηση. :-) Δεν καταργεί τις τράπεζες γενικά. Απλώς βοηθάει να δημιουργηθεί μια ελεύθερη αγορά και σε μια ελεύθερη αγορά κανείς δεν θα εμπιστευόταν μια τράπεζα σαν τις σημερινές που θα έχει κλασματικό απόθεμα. Άρα απλά μπορεί να κάνει το υπάρχον τραπεζικό σύστημα να καταρρεύσει, αλλά τράπεζες με μια μορφή ή άλλη θα συνεχίσουν να υπάρχουν, γιατί καλύπτουν πραγματικές ανάγκες (π.χ. δάνεια, μακροπρόθεσμες καταθέσεις).Τον καπιταλισμό δεν τον καταργεί, κάθε άλλο μάλιστα, τον διευκολύνει και δυσκολεύει τα κράτη να βάζουν χέρι στην αγορά, ειδικά στην "μαύρη" αγορά.Ευτυχώς δεν τον καταργεί. Καπιταλισμός είναι απλά το σύστημα στο οποίο επιτρέπεται ιδιοκτησία από ιδιώτες και οι ελεύθερες συναλλαγές μεταξύ των ιδιωτών. Σήμερα δεν έχουμε καπιταλισμό, καθώς τα κράτη βάζουν πάρα πολύ συχνά χέρι στην οικονομία, κρατώντας ανοικτές χρεοκοπημένες επιχειρήσεις (τράπεζες, βαριά βιομηχανία) και δυσκολεύοντας την είσοδο ανταγωνισμού σε τομείς όπου θέλουν να προστατεύσουν για πολιτικούς (ή "κοινωνικούς" όπως λένε) λόγους τις υπάρχουσες επιχειρήσεις (ΜΜΕ, επικοινωνίες και σχεδόν οποιονδήποτε τομέα εκτός της πληροφορικής που ευτυχώς μπορείς να κάνεις έδρα και σε άλλα κράτη). Περισσότερο με μερκαντιλισμό μοιάζουν τα συστήματα που υπάρχουν σήμερα.Το αν ο καθαρός καπιταλισμός οδηγεί σε ανισότητες μεγαλύτερες ή μικρότερες από τις ανισότητες που δημιουργούνται ενώ υπάρχουν κράτη είναι άλλη συζήτηση. Ακόμα και αν δημιουργεί ανισότητες, αυτό δε σημαίνει ότι κανείς έχει το δικαίωμα να τις εξαλείψει με τη βία. Για παράδειγμα αν ο Νίκος έχει 3 καρέκλες και εγώ έχω μία, δεν έχεις εσύ δικαίωμα να του πάρεις με το ζόρι μια-δυο καρέκλες για να τις δώσεις σε εμένα. Αν θες να βοηθήσεις μπορείς να το κάνεις με δικά σου μέσα: αγόρασέ μου μια καρέκλα π.χ.Αν έχεις δικαίωμα να του πάρεις μια καρέκλα με το ζόρι τότε κατά τη γνώμη μου θα πρέπει να έχεις δικαίωμα να πάρεις και το ένα νεφρό από κάποιον που έχει 2 για να το δώσεις σε κάποιον που δεν έχει κανένα. Πράγματι μια τέτοια κοινωνία θα έδινε παραπάνω πιθανότητες επιβίωσης σε όλους άρα από άποψη ισότητας, αλλά και γενικά από οποιαδήποτε ωφελιμιστική άποψη, είναι καλύτερη από τη σημερινή. Παρ' όλ' αυτά σχεδόν όλοι αντιδρούμε όταν ακούμε τέτοιες εισβολές στην αυτοιδιοκτησία κάποιου.Γιατί, όμως, η ιδιοκτησία δεν εμπεριέχεται στην αυτοιδιοκτησία; Αν φτιάξω κάτι και αυτό το π.χ. εκραγεί και σε τραυματίσει, προφανώς φταίω μόνο εγώ. Άρα αναγνωρίζεις άμεσα ότι είμαι υπεύθυνος για την ιδιοκτησία μου. Μάλιστα όσο καιρό μετά την απόκτηση κάποιου πράγματος και αν συμβεί το ατύχημα που προκλήθηκε από την ιδιοκτησία μου και πάλι αναγνωρίζεις εμένα ως υπεύθυνο. Άρα τι αλλάζει ξαφνικά και θεωρείς ότι έχεις δικαίωμα να πάρεις (με τη βία αν χρειαστεί) κάτι που μου ανήκει για να φέρεις ισότητα και μάλιστα ισότητα όπως εσύ την φαντάζεσαι; Και εν τέλη αν δεν έχω εγώ το απόλυτο δικαίωμα στη χρήση ενός αντικειμένου, που έφτιαξα, γιατί εσύ έχεις δικαίωμα να αποφασίσεις ποιος είναι ο ιδιοκτήτης;Αν η απάντησή σου εδώ είναι ότι έχεις δικαίωμα γιατί οι περισσότεροι συμφωνούν μαζί σου, τότε δεν έχεις εξηγήσει και πολλά. Κάποτε οι πολλοί συμφωνούσαν ότι η δουλεία είναι ΟΚ. Αν σε έστελνα ένα ταξίδι στον χρόνο σε μια εποχή με δούλους και έβλεπες μπροστά σου έναν δούλο να προσπαθεί να σηκώσει χέρι ενάντια στο αφεντικό του, ποιον θα βοηθούσες; Αποκλείεται να άκουγες την άποψη της πλειοψηφίας και να ήσουν με το μέρος του αφεντικού. Άρα το ότι η πλειοψηφία συμφωνεί με μια ηθική πρόταση δε λέει τίποτα για το κατά πόσο είναι σωστή η πρόταση.Αν η απάντησή σου πάλι είναι ότι αντικειμενικά χρειάζεσαι κάτι παραπάνω από αυτόν από τον οποίο το "κλέβεις" για να φέρεις ισότητα τότε: 1. Τι γίνεται με την περίπτωση των νεφρών; Και εκεί μπορεί να χρειάζεσαι "αντικειμενικά" παραπάνω το ένα νεφρό κάποιου από ότι ο ίδιος το χρειάζεται. Έχεις λοιπόν δικαίωμα να πάρεις το νεφρό κάποιου με τη βία αν είναι να σώσεις μια ζωή πχ; Και 2. ίσως, εκτός από ακραίες καταστάσεις ζωής και θανάτου, οι περισσότερες ανισότητες που βλέπεις δεν είναι αντικειμενικές. Ποιος είναι πιο πλούσιος; Κάποιος που έβγαλε μια σχολή μετά από 6 χρόνια και έχει έναν μικρό αλλά σταθερό μισθό; Κάποιος που δεν έχει βγάλει σχολή και έχει τεράστιες καταθέσεις; Κάποιος που ανακάλυψε κάτι σημαντικό, έβγαλε λεφτά και τώρα ξύνεται για δύο χρόνια μέχρι να του έρθει η επόμενη ιδέα; Δεν υπάρχει αντικειμενικός τρόπος να συγκρίνεις τον ελεύθερο χρόνο διαφορετικών ατόμων, ούτε τις ανάγκες τους. Άρα στην πράξη κάνεις ανακατανομή πλούτου πάντα βασιζόμενος στην υποκειμενική σου γνώμη.Άρα αν αφήσεις το κάθε άτομο ελεύθερο να κάνει οτιδήποτε μη βίαιο με την ιδιοκτησία του, δηλαδή αν δεν αρπάζεις βίαια την ιδιοκτησία άλλων για να φέρεις την οποιαδήποτε μορφή ισότητας φαντάζεσαι εσύ ή η πλειοψηφία τότε, θέλοντας και μη, θα καταλήξεις σε καπιταλισμό. Δηλαδή, σε άτομα που ανταλλάσσουν ελεύθερα ό,τι αγαθά έχει ο κάθε ένας. Αν θεωρείς ότι το σύστημα αυτό είναι άδικο ή άνισο, το καλό θα είναι ότι δεν είναι ανάγκη να συμμετέχεις καν σε αυτό. Μπορείς να κάνεις ένα κοινόβιο πχ και να ζήσεις εκεί, δεν υπάρχει τίποτα στον καπιταλισμό που στο απαγορεύει.Το σημερινό σύστημα δεν έχει καμία σχέση με τον καπιταλισμό. Ή αν δεν μας αρέσει ο τρόπος που χρησιμοποιώ την λέξη: Το σημερινό "καπιταλιστικό" σύστημα δεν έχει σχέση με το οικονομικό σύστημα που υποστηρίζει το bitcoin. Come on... Stilll nobody?? New one:Congrats for the dot matrix answer! And someone bet "sofa" before reading the hint which says I need more >1 word. New one. Read the hint on that one... Thank you zx81.Here's a new one: And a new one![img width=200]https://apopheniabtc.com/processed/9a084db1a282a1265820f8ce5aa57b7a2e2d39b5b0460f6407f540a4d5d8f78a[/width]Good luck!   Here's a new one. :-)Need the title. Well, not for much longer. :-) I was hopping that I hadn't accidentally written something else maybe in another language in there...  New one: What's this?
The last one took way to long to get solved. You people ain't paying attention? ;-)New one! New pic!What does the text say? New pic!Who's that?bobsmith yes I turned them to manual some time ago because of some bug that I am still not sure that I have fixed. I should note that in the instructions somewhere for now since it's become a semipermanent situation.(EDIT: You should be getting the payout in a few minutes.) New pic!What's this? New pic. Who's that? Site's back in case you missed it for a couple of hours. What's this? New pic! What does the text say? Sorry for that. I'm having some trouble with my VPS again. Try now. New pic!Need the title. Something a bit different.  This is a sketch of something: Need the title!Also, to answer a few points:Faster descrambling is not a good idea because some pictures are pretty obvious from quite the start. Look at the recent "bike" picture or the "mosquito" in the past. It could be done if I could decide the descrambling speed on a per picture basis but I've seen my, obviously biased, hardness estimation fail, quite often.More than one picture at the same time open is something I'm willing to do.Saisen there is currently no bonus. The only way to earn something from the site without paying for a bet is to spread your referral URL. Other than that if you just want to play for free you can still do it but I believe you meant play and win btc, right?PS: Unluckyduck sorry for the delayed payout. I have to confirm the payouts manually for a little while. Yes sometimes my Bitcoin client fails to restart properly and it ends up without it for a couple of hours. I made some changes and I'm waiting to see if it will happen again now.New picture! Not a faucet site but the current return to player is >160% on https://apopheniabtc.com until more players join. You still need a few mBTC to play though. Or you can use the referrals for free. Ehem... I think the answer is pretty obvious already... Hahaha I had forgotten about the "somethings".   You know... in every picture, there is some guy placing a bet for "leaves" and never paying for it.  Sometime I'll put a picture of leaves and no one will believe it. New pic! New one:I also changed the fees. Lowered the starting pot and lowered the portion of the bet that is kept by the site. (Check fees section for details) Yeap. Here it is:
You think I should try finger modeling?  BTW HappyBuddy you managed to find a bug! :-) I think you've gotten double the reward. I'll try to find what caused this because it should have been impossible and then upload a new picture. EDIT: Actually, can you confirm this? Because it looks like I am not missing any BTC so it must be a bug in my last payments listing code and not in the payments code. EDIT2: Nope, not a display problem, it actually sent the award twice.   EDIT3: I think I found the bug, I'm 99% sure that it was a very VERY special case triggered by the recent server downtime. I think I patched it now. Actually you can try entering that answer and see what comes up. :-) EDIT: don't pay, just try to bet on that answer. I think so, yes. They have got a big difference in blocks that came after they got confirmed. No idea how you managed that. :-)Here is a new picture too:What does the text say? The address is indeed correct but no payment has been seen on the network to this address. What bitcoin client do you use? Maybe your blockchain is out of sync or the client is offline, if that even applies to your client.EDIT: It looks like it got through a few minutes ago. Still at zero confirmations though. Just... wow, Unluckyduck.And now for something slightly different!@fuggedit: I don't want to sell it yet but thank you for the generous offer, really :-). I'm in the middle of implementing localization for a couple of languages. Actually the Greek translation is almost ready (I did it just to see if the translation system works) and in a couple of days I'll probably have a Portuguese translation too. I also got a couple of other features that I want to implement first. I read this 5 times and still don't know what it says. What's "+"? Is "mine" in "mine transactions" a verb or are they some new kind of transactions? Good point! I'm fixing it now... You were lucky you didn't play. :-)Here's a new one though:  Here's a new pic:  It was "EVE Online".   Bets are open again and here's a new picture:I had to remove the previous picture because it was pretty clear and reopening it would basically create an unfair race where the fastest to notice that it's open would win. No bets had been placed on the picture so no one is affected.Have fun!PS: It looks like the forum image proxy doesn't like the fact that my pictures don't end in jpg. I'll see what I can do to fix this... till then go to apophenia and see the image there. :-)PS2: I've got no idea why the forums keep saying that the image is invalid. Apophenia pictures now end in .jpg so it should have worked. I'll see what else I can do. :-)PS3: And they're back. It wasn't the file extension that was missing, it was the MIME type I was serving. Migration completed. Domains are now being pointed to the right IP so you should be able to see the site in a while. BUT I will turn off payments for a day or so because the blockchain DB has been corrupt and has to be rebuilt which will take a day probably. :-(I will add more time to the currently open picture if possible or discard it.Again sorry for the hassle but there wasn't much to do other than wait... Let's just hope that the new node won't have performance issues. My hosting provider is wasting my time once more, asking questions that I have already answered, failing to migrate me to a different node and stalling the whole process for hours. I expect apophenia to be down for another 8 hours tops. Sorry for the downtime guys, I wish I could whip them to have them fix things faster.  Still no one?? Here a new one and sorry for the delay: Sorry for not updating often (that's my fault) and sorry for the service downtime (that's my host's fault). There is some major issue with my VPS and I'm migrating to another node. Everything should run smoothly after that. So expect some final downtime soon and after that it should be fine. New one! New hintless (but probably not very hard) picture:   Hmm you are right. Let me take a look and see what happened. (I moved to a bigger server before a few days, maybe I messed up something in the process).I will edit this post when I've fixed this.[edit] Aaaand done. Aparently I cannot have tx outputs less than 5500 (or below a number between 5450-5500) even though the spec says that the minimal is 5430 satoshis. in case you missed it, here's the new pic:
Tylerik you probably tried to submit the answer during the restart of the bitcoin client. :-) Well done finding the answer! Will post a new one in a few minutes! Movie/Series. Cheaper and somewhat faster. (well cheaper in BTC, in fiat it's about the same as the others.  ) Thank you all! :-) I Forgot to post a picture here. Someone solved it and it was Persepolis.New picture is up:PS: Also the payment for the last picture was delayed somewhat. Sorry for that. Added Hungarian forint. So. Someone answered dumpsters which was correct. I had included 10 answers or so and I didn't think of dumpsters. Just look at the answers!!! Look how many weird answers there were there to give and yet dumpsters wasn't one of them!Anyhow I included the answer and that player won. :-)To the player that answered "bins": that was probably close but "bins" is quite generic so I wouldn't ask for that. If I did I would have to accept answers like "containers" too.New picture: Hintless because I really couldn't decide upon a hint. ;-) Well, technically, he is right! It's somethings...   New one. It looks like I made them easier so they get solved way faster. I'll tweak the algorithm a bit... ;-) Which one do you mean? The latest pic is two posts above. And since that was uber easy here's another one: New one! Here it is since it looks like we've got quite a few gamers here.  (sorry for the quick second post but I want subscribers to get a notification of it. ;-) ) Indeed! Wow many tries on this one... Will post a new pic in a while. I expected that someone would have solved it by now.   Indeed. Always check out the hint! Well I just grab shots from whatever movie comes to mind but yeah I might have focused on older movies a bit. I'll try to change that.Here's another movie/series. :-) Must be getting easier now... I had a possibly interesting conversation over email. I'm posting it here in case it interests someone:Oh also this picture is still open:(no it's not open. I'll post a new one asap) This one is hintless but it shouldn't be hard IMO. ;-)Well done to whoever solved the last one. Something we haven't tried for some time:I need the real name. (of the person)
Avira started detecting the rcpminer-cpu.exe as a Security or Private Risk (SPR/BitCoin.djh.1). Also if you search the file's hash on google you'll find that it's known as winvnc86.exe and wininiit.exe. I suppose someone used it in a botnet or other trojan? So, it's getting somewhat easier and there are already 5 bets on it. I added Coinbase Bitcoin (CBS) to the currency list. Updated version should be up in a few minutes. Bad luck really. :-|I hope you are good in games: So, something funny happened. Two people guessed the correct answer 2 minutes apart. The SECOND guess managed to get confirmed by the network first though, probably because of the slightly higher fee! 0.0001 vs 0.0005.Reminder:1. The first judge of who gets checked for correctness is the bitcoin network. If you get into the blockchain first, you are checked first.2. If more than one bets get into the same block together, the bets are checked by time submitted. Movie/Series again. :-) Sorry for this. There was some problem with my bitcoin client and I didn't notice in time. Bets are not affected. Will fix that now.UPDATING: Still downloading the blockchain. It's going slower than expected. Hint: Movie/Series title  ΟΚ δεν λέω μαλάκας είναι αλλά "ρητορική μίσους"; Μιλάμε σοβαρά τώρα;  Απλά αγνοήστε τον ή προσβάλλετέ τον και εσείς μην τον κυνηγάτε μέσω moderators.(http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b48_1305790944)   Here is a new picture:Please the read the hint. It's a special case this one. ;-) This is in my plans although not in the immediate ones. I've nooticed that most people who start playing, stay so I should first focus on bringing more new players and not so much in trying to keep the old ones. But it's definitely in my plans. Only 50% of the bet gets added to the pot. The rest is kept by the site. But currently the site looses more money paying for he starting pots (which are funded exclusively by the site's wallet) than what it's making by that 50% of each bet. So until there are more bets per picture (in other words more bets per starting pot I pay) I am loosing money.The system you propose wouldn't work because the first player to bet would have no reason to bet since there would be NO starting pot. ;-) So I have to pay for the starting pot myself for every picture I upload. It's exactly what b!z said.As for the current picture, if you don't see any text, then it's still too early to guess. The pictures start REALLY distorted. You should wait some hours for the picture to clean up. If you click on the picture (on the site, not here) a window will open that allows you to bet on the picture (if you think you know the answer), to see the hint for the picture, to see any wrong bets that have been already placed on the picture (you don't want to bet something that has been already tried by someone else) and to see how many hours remain for the picture. As time passes by the picture get more and more clean. My suggestion would be to just leave a tab open in your browser and check it whenever you can. If you see a picture that you can solve, bet on it. The tab autorefreshes every 10 minutes. Instead of spending time on free BTC sites, which is nice but you'd be getting paid more for doing almost any job in the world, why not use your guessing skills to earn some BTC on Apophenia?Currently the payback is way more than 100% which means that, on average, for every bitcoin played the site distributes back more than 1 BTC. So, yeah, on average, I am still loosing money but I hope this will change as more people get in. Until that time why don't you take advantage of this?Here is the site: https://apopheniabtc.comThe minimum bet right now is 0.004฿ and if your guess is correct you will get 0.026฿. (Usually those numbers are both a little bit higher)You can read all the rules and stuff on the site but the general idea is that your are trying to guess a distorted picture. The picture gradually gets less distorted so if you don't guess early someone else will guess and you'll get nothing. If you guess too early chances are that you won't guess correctly because of the distrortion. Most pictures also have a hint so make sure you read that before you guess.There is only one picture on the site right now (I regularly keep 1 or 2 pictures open):The hint says: "What's the text saying". This means that this picture is something like a captcha. Somewhere behind the distortion is some piece of text. You have to type what that text says as an answer.There are other categories of pictures: movies, actor names, video games, objects, places, animals. Anything goes. Also some times I post hintless pictures where you have NO IDEA what the picture shows, those are much harder to solve but having your mind free to guess is fun cause the apophenia effect kicks in badly and you see completelly different stuff. :-)Also, Apophenia has a referral program which could earn you a few cents. When someone visits the site using your referral link, you get to earn 5% of their betting fees (as long as they don't clear their cookies or change browser, they are marked as YOURS).The link is in this form: https://apopheniabtc.com/?partner=youraddressOr if you need BBcode for your signature: Code:[size=14pt][glow=black,2]__[url=http://apopheniabtc.com?partner=forumsig][color=orange]ApopheniaBTC - Win [btc] for solving challenges![/color][/url]__[/glow][/size]The main Apophenia thread is here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=183240Feel free to ask any questions! (or browse through the main thread since I've answered lots of things there too) Yes and yes but I can't really tell you when. :-)Well done to whoever solved frozen synapse! Θα κατέβω σε λίγο καιρό Πάτρα για εξεταστική. Φοιτητής; I think you got it nicely but FYI this is the BBcode: Code:[size=14pt][glow=black,2]__[url=http://apopheniabtc.com?partner=forumsig][color=orange]ApopheniaBTC - Win [btc] for solving challenges![/color][/url]__[/glow][/size]Instead of "forumsig" you put your bitcoin address of course. Aaaaah now I get what you're saying. I thought you were talking about me changing the correct answer but you mean me changing the picture. That's a problem with textual images only of course, I can't change a film image as this would be an obvious change. Also even in the textual images the text is big enough for any change to be visible. Don't forget that pictures are updated every ~10 minutes so the progression of every update is slow enough for big changes in the origin picture to be visible. But still, yeah, that can be solved without requiring people to download and compare successive progressions of the pictures. IIRC the random name of the pictures is some sort of hash of the contents+filename of the original picture but that picture is never released, only the B&W version of it so the hash doesn't match. I'll see what I can do about this.(Nope, just checked the names are completely random.)Did I sound defensive in the striked-through text? If so, I didn't mean to. :-) Pro: You would be sure that I ain't changing answers during the whole process.Con: Some times someone places an answer that SHOULD be correct but I had made a mistake and didn't include it. In some of this cases I edit the answers to include the missing answer. That system would make it impossible for me to correct legitimate errors on my correct answers. Also while you can see those answers click again on the big picture. It will clean up.It's not worth it in my opinion. If you are worried that I am cleaning the answers for some reason, you have to worry even more about me telling my friends the correct answers or answering the pictures myself to steal the pot. I've given this a lot of thought and I think there is absolutely no way to make Apophenia provably fair. The biggest problem is the fact that I (or someone) will always know the answers.Even the https://apopheniabtc.com/txs.php mostly exist to provide information and not give a false sense of fairness to people. Sure know it's probably hard for me to hide bets but I don't need to hide bets in the first place if I wanted to cheat.I think I misunderstood what you were saying. Hehe.When an image is solved or expired, you open it and click on it to load the clean version. Also when the correct answer is given, you can see ALL the correct answers in the image's window. Go to apophenia and click the "blue screen of death" picture. You'll notice that both "blue screen of death and bsod is mentioned in the answers section.No it's just a custom piece of code that I wrote while experimenting with different kinds of distorting images. the general idea is to convert pixels in the picture into triangles of the same color. Add a second shadow image, some transparency into some of those triangles and you've got the effect you see. Oh and as times passes, those triangles get smaller and smaller until they become the pixels they were created from and the whole pictures gets clear. Oh and the shadow image also moves towards the base image so it isn't visible anymore. Bets are checked after one network confirmation + ~1 minute. So on average your bet will be checked in 11 minutes. It could go much higher than that though if the network doesn't produce blocks or if your bet doesn't get into any block.In any case bets are prioritized by first by the block they appeared and secondly by the time they were placed. If you don't include any fee and you don't get included in the next lets say two block and someone else bets the same thing and includes a fee so he does get included in the next block, he will win. If you both get included in the same block, the first bet wins.But I don't see any recent bet. The last one is "battleship" which has been checked and is included in the "wrong answers" of the game picture. Is that the bet you're talking about?
Here's one more pic. It's a textual one: Each of those tips definitely cuts your guesses into more than half. So if they do cost less than a bet, you'd be a fool not to buy them unless you are really sure you know the answer. In the end it will make people waste money on fees since everyone will have a huge incentive to buy the hints. They do REALLY need to be more expensive than the bet as I see it. Anyway I'll think about it. Or I'll just go for the picture hint which doesn't need to be THAT expensive depending on how much time it will be adding to the picture. We'll see. ;-)Since you mentioned forum signatures, and for everyone's information, I've set up a referral system. To access your custom URL just place ANY bet (you don't have to pay, just place it and use a valid bitcoin address for it, one that you own) and you'll get a referral URL for that address.I feel that an advanced picture hint would make more sense be more fair. Mostly because the advantage you get is temporary. So when you think that this game is Team Fortress but you don't want to loose the bet, you may be willing to loose some money to reduce the chances of making a mistake. You'll pay, that will add some clarity to the picture and then you go on and bet or not bet. If you don't bet (since the hint showed you you were wrong), then your advantage slowly diminishes as the picture moves towards what you saw earlier in the hint. And part of those hints also gets added to the pot.I start to like this idea. I was thinking that practically any kind of hint will give you more chances to win than having to ability to double bet each time your bet. Imagine this case:The free hint is: "it's a game"The paid hint is: "it's team based"The answer is: "team fortress 2"What would you prefer? Being able to bet a second time for every bet you pay for? Or having access to the paid tip? I would surely prefer the hint over the free bets. That means that in this scenario the hint should cost MORE than a bet. As in 110%, not 10%.Cryptic hints would be even more helpful in my opinion. Consider the same scenario but the paid hint is: "Need a ... here."With that hint all you have to do is start guessing random games and seeing if this hint makes sense. When you reach TF2, you will notice that the hint makes perfect sense. Even if this guesswork doesn't work, chances are that the hint will be at least an excellent confirmation mechanism before you place for a bet. Does the hint make sense? If not, don't bet. That will save you a lot of money, even more than a hint like "it's team based". So it has to cost even more. Unless I make it really, really cryptic...In any reasonable case, a textual hint should cost more than a bet.If they are too cheap, everyone will buy them, so why implement them. They need to be priced properly else they will be something like an entrance fee to the site. I'm talking about textual hints here. :-/Well right now maybe you can't. But if more people start betting and the hints aren't priced highly, you should expect that someone has bought it when the picture has progressed enough.Sure, you can't make everyone happy. My point here is that hints don't remove "fairness" complains from the site since they don't make the game more "fair" in any sense. On the other hand I can imagine people complaining about them. So, ceteris paribus, I THINK hints would increase complaints and thus dissatisfaction. I can't be sure of course, for example now I've seen two players askign for hints so some people would be more satisfied.I think I'm going to try this. I will start adding paid hints to some pictures while leaving other only with the free hint. I'll need some time to make this though.I don't want to touch accounts. Unique URLs were my idea also. Click on "Buy extra hint" to be taken to a unique page, pay to the address there and AJAX load the impoved picture when payment is received.Another hint idea: View the picture with a different kind of distortion. That has a little problem though, if you overlay the two pictures with the different distortions, you will probably end up with a cleaner version of the picture. That means that people who know how to use picture editing software will have an extra advantage so I guess this is not such a good idea. Paid hints, if implemented correctly, may indeed raise profits.My main concerns are these: (I could be wrong in some or all of these, they are not proper arguments, just concerns)1. In most pictures a hint will rule out lots of possible answers which might decrease the pot. Maybe I could make a portion of the money go towards the pot but again, wouldn't a hint decrease the total possible number of guesses? Why guess two or three times, when you can buy a hint and guess once with a higher probability to win?2. It will cause players to focus more on a single picture rather than spreading their guesses to all of the available ones. This could be good or bad, I don't know. It would surely be against players that just want to pay just for one guess per 2 days. Those players would either face the disadvantage of having fewer info than other players that want to bet multiple times on a pic, or pay for the hint as if it was obligatory.3. In a picture that is close lets say to 50%, if nobody has solved it then you can be pretty sure that without the hint you have very few chances of solving it (since someone else has probably bought the tip and still wasn't able to solve it). This makes the tip look somewhat obligatory. It reminds me of pay-to-win games. If it really ends up being obligatory, then I could as well ask for an entrance fee to the site. Also see point 3: the hint would be pretty much obligatory for occasional players.4. Slightly increased complexity for the player.5. No matter what the configuration of the hinting system, after some time (maybe a long time) it will be "easy" to calculate whether hints pay back for their money or not. And after that point you will either always buy one or never buy it. Until that time though I think hints will make the game more "random" for most players since you won't be able to know how helpful the tip will be or whether you should buy it or not. More randomness will cause more frustration as even the current randomness of the game has caused frustration to some people. I can already imagine people complaining about how helpful for others was the tip that they didn't buy and which caused them to loose 3 bets, or how useless was the tip that they bought.Here is an alternative that almost "fixes" point 2 and 3 and maybe 4: Pay to see the picture advanced by X hours or by X% of the remaining hours. You only get to see ONE scnapshot so the advantage you buy is temporary, as time passes, other players reach the point that you saw. That way occasional players don't necessarily compete with players that have paid for a permanent hint that is valid during the whole duration of the picture. This way the game won't be that much pay-to-win as players will need to constantly buy new hints in order to have a permanent advantage over other players which won't be worth the money.One concern about this system: Would it NEED to be 0-confirmations? Would it be too much to ask someone to wait 10 minutes (or in some cases much more), in order to see the picture advanced by 1 hour for example? Of course the picture will be advanced by 1 hour after the time the hint payment was CONFIRMED, not the time it was PAID. But still I feel that paid hints would just make the game more random.I would like to hear more thoughts on this... There are two open pictures right now:First is hintless, second one is some game. Will do when I get back home. :-)@Isamaru It's not easy to find objects that will not confuse anyone. I wouldn't expect the router to confuse anyone since there is only one correct name to distinguish that object from other objects: router. For example when I had posted a CD ROM in the past, there was no correct answer "audio CD" although it could have been an audio CD. Someone could claim that it's confusing because he though he had to guess what kind of CD it is. In the end, the chances of anyone getting confused are pretty much proportional to his "skill" which is what this game is about. Sure there is a factor of luck but that's the same for everyone and it only spices things up a bit, either for good or bad. ;-) There are practically no wireless modems. The fact that's it's wireless means that it does route IP packets from the internal WiFi network to the internet. So plain "modem" is not correct since you don't even know if this actually has a modem. What you know is that it's wireless and that it's a router so the correct answers are: "router" / "modem router" / "wifi router" / "wireless router" / "wlan router" / "router with wifi" / "router with wlan" / "dsl router"It's obvious that you knew what it was but you bet on a wrong answer. Any answer that didn't contain router would be considered wrong. Well, better luck next time, sometimes you'll think of something similar first and you might loose some cents betting on that.But why did you have so much fees? Were your transaction inputs that many?? Keep an eye on this one as it gets easier: (I just added it) New features in v3.1.0: The custom graph gets tied to the conversion result when you click on some other currency in the converter! If you hover on Biticker's icon in your browser, you can now see the current difficulty too. Also some other minor changes. I'll start paying some cents for ads first to bring a few more players first. For higher bets I need more players as it has been already mentioned. ;-) What? What dividend??EDIT: I just saw the payment. What's up with that? Did Robin Hood rob Rando? New one:   Still no correct answer to this one? Hahaha, why not?  Give it some more time to clear more. Don't give it much more time though for someone else might solve it. ;-) All of them get poster right after they are checked for correctness. Which takes like 2 minutes after they get confirmed by the network. One more text challenge: That's still the biggest one I think. ;-) Here's a hintless one. :-) Hello Transisto. Nice to see people sticking to my stuff. :-)No the icon is always the same. I recently changed the icon to be reddish/lava-ish to distinguish it from the classic yellow/gold icon that many extensions use.What actually shows the direction of the last price change is the background color of the ticker (the badge) itself. Red for falling, green for rising.Also you can always switch back to the old yellow icon if you want. Go to the option's page, somewhere near the bottom.
Not always. Sometimes they do. You can check the old challenges for other (solved) text challenges. It gets easier on its own. ;-)Although I suppose you mean I should deversify the questions because not everyone is good at movies. Well, I just did. Check the two new pics. I've got the candlesticks in mind but I need to change some other things first in the graphs. For example if my server crashes for 24 hours, the graphs will PAUSE for 24 hours. And when it resumes generating graph points it will resume from the point it stopped! So the old parts will be "out of sync" sort  of. They will look like they were 30 hours ago (for example) but in reality those points will be 30+24=54 hours ago. I first need to fix this and then I'll probably do the candlesticks. Currently it's just to take a quick glance at what the price has been.Do not forget that you can always use a custom graph URL!!! So you can go to bitcoincharts, generate your own custom chart and copy the url to biticker! (Just try to add a parameter to make the graph width 700px if possible, else it will be scaled.) Good work on that one! It wasn't easy.Yeah that's normal. I should fix it at some point but it's not a big deal so it's low on my todo list.Two new ones:   There are two open pics: Version 3.0.0 is out.* The long promised graphs are here. They are far from perfect so give them a try and tell me what you think.* New icon. The common bitcoin icon was... common, so I edited it a little.* In the options page, you dont' have to click exactly on the checkbox of currencies and the option boxes, you can now also click around them in their cell and it will still work. Should make currency selection easier. Ha at last someone solved this. :-)Here's the latest one:  Bitstamp και Πειραιώς. 0.5 ευρώ για το έμβασμα από ebanking. Αν το στείλεις μεσημέρι την επόμενη το πρωί συνήθως έχουν μπει. Αλλιώς την μεθεπόμενη. Πιο εύκολα δεν γίνεται. Δεν θέλουν verification για κάτω από κάποιο ποσό. (1000 όπως λέει ο PurpleTentacle) Did a correction to one of the pictures. Again I forgot to include the correct answer. I mixed up immigrants with refugees... Here's a new one:  Version 2.3 added support for Ripples (XRP).EDIT:Same day update: Version 2.4 adds MinCoin (MNC) That's not true, you'd still win. The site has no way to know if you are aware of the block confirming your correct answer (i.e. if you have synced client). Also, after I release the bet payment to the bitcoin network, there is no way to cancel it.EDIT: And AFAIK, you can send coins even if you haven't fully synced the blockchain. At least with the QT client. Here's a new oneEDIT: I accidentally posted an admin link instead of the image url but don't worry it doesn't work from any computer other than my own. ;-) Probably. I see two people betting on Clerks, 6 minutes apart. In about 10 minutes those two bets will be visible in the last txs page. (They only appear there after two confirmations)Now this is bad luck for you. You two are basically confirmed by the same block, but the other buy was 6 minutes faster so his answer is checked first. :-/EDIT: Actually you are already visible in the txs page. I was looking at an old tab which I hadn't refreshed a long time. Also only the hintless picture is open now. I'll add two more in a while. :-) Here is a hintless picture after a long time:  Virustotal says site is clean: https://www.virustotal.com/en/url/40eccf336c323c4bf615e34cc97cf15dcaca553d2363003e9f1f3fdd442344c0/analysis/1372677169/Now the contact button though seems to work on all my browsers. Can you tell me what OS and browsers you tried? I wild guess is that some spyware/toolbar/other-plugin messed up the javascript on apophenia which causes both the contact button to not work AND Avast to complain about the scripts on the page. Could it be that?EDIT: There may have been a little problem with the payout, I'm checking this now. No need to worry everyone will get what he/she should.EDIT2: All set. I had to send a second pot to the actual winner. While my bitcoind was offline some addresses expired and when I turned it back on it checked the still valid addresses so it awarded the pot to someone who had answered recently. But someone had answered correctly before that and his address had expired. In any case everybody should be getting what he is owed now, if you think for any reason that you got a wrong amount just tell me.   Give me a minute to check everything and I'll be posting again.EDIT:Argh my bad! I was sure I had updated my bitcoin client but I was still running 0.8.1 which is probably why it stopped connecting to other nodes today. I'm updating and restarting it. It will process everything in the order it was placed so nobody will be affected.I'm really sorry for the delay people. I only made money from a few pics. Generally I'm loosing money but only a little so I don't currently mind it. The whole project has stagnated a bit lately because I'm busy with other things but this will change next week probably when I'll be able to work on Apophenia again. Same goes for Biticker, didn't have time to improve anything lately. One more today:BTW congratulations to whoever found the Hot Chocolate one... Amazing catch.Oh and the video game one is becoming easier I think... The RTP is still more than 100% so someone is making bucks out of this. ;-)BTW I did a slight fine tuning of the distortion algorithm.And a new one: BTW srry for uploading some photos rotated. Those are taken with my phone's camera and the stupid camera doesn't store them rotated properly, instead it just stores some metadata with the photo that set the orientation for gallery apps to view the photo properly but apophenia can't read these metadata so the picture end up being rotated improperly. And I can't notice that until quite a few hours later when it gets clear. On the other hand though it doesn't really matter that much... ;-)
Haha I know. I am posting them here because the get refreshed here too. The picture URL is static so whenever the pictures improves on the site, it does here too. Here are the currently active pics:   There was a picture of a USB sound card which, while I had an extensive list of possible variations of the answer (check them out), was answered by an answer I didn't think of: usb sound adapter.I changed the picture to include that as an answer, awarded the pot to the player that bet that one and refunded three bets that had been placed after the correct, but missing, answer.Please note though that in some cases, as I have mentioned in the past, I will not or I will not be able to do this so some answer, although it might look perfectly correct might not be counting as correct and I may be expecting some variation of it. That a risk that you take by playing but it's also an opportunity for those that check past answers. If some of them seems perfectly correct but is not accepted, try some variations and you might get a right one. I usually place enough variations of the answer so that you'll probably hit a correct one before a wrong one.Also there are two pictures open now. I'll upload more tomorrow:   Don't forget about the referral links. :-) Hello everyone!Three pictures are open now:   Αν έχεις κάνει solo mining τότε μπορείς να υπογράψεις κάτι με το ιδιωτικό κλειδί της διεύθυνσης που δέχτηκε τα φρεσκοκομμένα BTC.Αν κάνεις pooled mining τότε δεν νομίζω ότι υπάρχει τρόπος πέρα από το να δείξεις σε κάποιον το account σου στο pool που δείχνει πόσα έχεις βγάλει. Someone solved two of those so here are two more:  That's a good suggestion. The one with the letters is a bit hard since there might be multiple answers but the idea in general is good and I will consider it.Bet's are fewer nowadays. I'll start posting some easier pictures. I'll probably move to posting more objects rather than movies which are usually harder.Here are three open pics btw: I hope it won't happen again. I typed "forest" instead of "forrest". I had never though that it was written differently and I've seen the movie a dozen of times. If I didn't know the movie that good I would be more careful copying the title (in most cases I visit IMDB to grab the proper title).So, here are two new pics!  Sorry for this. I made a typo in the correct answer. I reset your bets and corrected the answer and then rechecked the bets for payment. It turns out someone has found this before all of the others but his bet never got confirmed so this is not considered correct.Other than that I see the first confirmed bet getting the pot PLUS a bet refund (that guy probably bet again the answer after a while) and I also see someone getting refunded for tropical thunder.The guy with the unconfirmed transaction will be refunded for his bet when the transaction gets through.Sorry for the delay, I was asleep. :-)So everything looks square now. If anyone has any more problems after this please announce them here (or PM me if you don't like publicity) and I'll fix them in the next hours (I'll be out for a while).Again sorry for the mess. :-) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=9261.0   I'll consider this. I will try putting some pictures with more specific hints saying the exact category and see how it'll go.I avoid all color on the site. I tried colored pictures but they totally ruin the pareidolia effect. Meaning people can easily rule out almost all of their guesses because of the colors present.Well, to be fair the reason there are so many bad guesses is because it's free to guess there. But I get what you are saying. Maybe I won't put movies in Hintless pictures and instead use objects for them or perhaps very well known movies.I'll break up my categories schedule a bit more. It'll be more specific.EDIT: Here is a new picture with a specific hint:  The "death on the nile" picture expired. Funny thing is that someone had placed the correct answer on it but hadn't paid his bet.I'll add its user pot to the next picture I upload. I accidentally uploaded one right now without adding the pot to it so I'll just add it to the next one tomorrow. New version (2.2) coming up in a few minutes:Option sound effects for notifications.Bug fixes mostly around the background color of the ticker.PS: easily customizable graphs will have to wait some more time before I figure out an efficient way to make them. Yeap.You know the initial idea about Apophenia was to let users upload challenges and just take a small portion of the profits. But then I though that it would be impossible to play since there would be a huge number of users uploading challenges that nobody solves because they don't trust them. And chances would be that scammers would be all over the site. Maybe if I was charging a listing fee it could work but I think it would just end up dying quickly unless some trusted member of the community started using it. Yeah it can be annoying at some times I guess. The good thing is that it's never unfair since it's the same for everyone. It's not unlike other games. You might come very close to the answer, miss, and then the opponent gets helped and finds the correct one. Of course there is an equal chance that you'll be on the other end of this. ;-)I could give more detailed hints but that would make it way less fun since it would give certainty to users about their answers. For example let's suppose that I want the answer "desktop". If I give a hint like "Object, give the exact type." users would rule out quite a few generic items. They might be thinking it's a pair of shoes but they would not bet until they know what shoes they are, which would probably never happen since they would first all realize it's a computer. Of course they would then start guess-betting all the possible type. Well I am not sure if that makes sense to you. :-) Αν θες μπορείς να στήσεις ένα doodle για να δούμε πόσοι μπορούνε και πότε. (http://doodle.com/) Μπορεί να δυσκολευτώ να έρθω λόγο εξεταστικής μέχρι τέλη Ιούνη. Ελπίζω να μπορώ να πεταχτώ γιατί είναι κρίμα να το χάσω. Γενικά μιας και το Bitcoin τραβάει περισσότερο νέους, ίσως να ήταν καλύτερα αν η συνάντηση γινόταν εκτός εξεταστικών περιόδων αν είναι φυσικά δυνατόν. Εδώ δεν μπορούμε καλά καλά να αλλάξουμε το τι ψηφίζουμε, ποια αλλαγή έχεις δει να αγαπάμε;  Εγώ βλέπω τον κόσμο να αλλάζει και να μας σέρνει από πίσω ενώ εμείς γκρινιάζουμε ότι δεν θέλουμε να αλλάξουμε. I put up some new pics. I don't remember which ones I have posted in this thread so here are the last two uploaded: 
Serenata ξέρουμε ακριβή ημερομηνία για την συνάντηση; There is a big problem with this. There is no way to distinguish a user that gives a detailed answer, from a user that submits multiple answers.For example he could be recognizing that it is a dog and then, since I would be asking for a character name, start listing all dog names in one answer, like: "lassie jack brucie bingo hatchie".Maybe I could only allow the answer to be a prefix of the string but this would again not solve the problem. Let's suppose I accept "lassie" and "lassie x" where x any word or words. This would be good for answers like "lassie the dog", but what about answers like "baby lassie"?Then I would need to start accepting "x lassie" too, which I bet would lead to having users double betting all the time like "lassie brucie" <- two answers in one bet, if one is correct then the user wins the pot. This would be a big problem. Συνήθως το πρωί της επόμενης εργάσιμης μπαίνουν, ή το μεσημεράκι. Αλλιώς την μεθεπόμενη. Τώρα αν έχιε πέσει κίνηση τρελή αυτόν τον καιρό και αργούνε, δεν ξέρω.Γιατί θες να κάνεις verify; Από όσο θυμάμαι δεν είναι υποχρεωτικό. Δεν είναι ανάγκη να είναι Έλληνας, είναι; Quite a few new features:You can now select ANY combination of currencies for the ticker (like LTC/EUR, EUR/DVC, EUR/USD etc).BTC ticker symbol is now the average BTC price, based on multiple exchanges.New GOX ticker symbol is the current Mt Gox price.Notifications for price of limits will not show a second time unless the price goes back within limits first.There might also be new bugs,  so if you see any don't forget to tell me about it! Με mining δεν ασχολούμαι πλέον. Παλιά έκανα λιγάκι για πλάκα κυρίως. Έχω κάνει solo mine και δύο ολόκληρα 50άρια block με το Core 2 Duo μου. Χεχε...Κατά τα άλλα φτιάχνω site κλπ (βλ. και υπογραφή). Έτσι νομίζω βγαίνουν πιο εύκολα κάποια coins.BTW γιατί πήγες στο MtGox; Για Ελλάδα το Bitstamp (μαζί με Πειραιώς) είναι πολύ καλύτερο IMO. Τι είναι τα δύο αυτά tx; Εδώ μίλησες; https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3889.0 Δεν ξέρω αν το ρεύμα στην Ελλάδα είναι φτήνο αλλά έχουμε πολύ μεγαλύτερες ανάγκη για ψύξη στα rigs. Το οποίο θέλει έξτρα ρεύμα. Έχε το και αυτό υπόψιν όταν υπολογίζεις profitability. Try not to find the answer at once. Some times finding a background object might narrow down what the answer is. Like the scrat picture. The nut was quite visible, if you could see that, well, which character holds a nut? You don't always have to keep asking yourself the main question "who is this character?".And take it easy. Go for the cheaper pictures first and when you see a solved picture, don't click one it and don't look at the answer. Instead right click on the thumbnail, save it somewhere and try to find what it is. When pictures get solved, they are no longer processed, which means that someone was able to solve the picture you see as it is.BTW in case someone hasn't noticed: you can see the full res picture if you click on a solved thumbnail and then click again on the big picture. Clicking that should switch between the original picture (in B&W) and the state of the picture as it was solved. Καλώς ήρθες. Γιατί δεν μιλάς Ελληνικά αφού ρωτάς στο Ελληνικό subforum;Για το θέμα σου τώρα, δεν ξέρω. Με το support τους μίλησες; No one. Just put something else. An anaglyph like PCB would be way better for a cryptocurrency. I had this conversation over PM, I got permission to post it here since it might interest other users too:Oh and since we are running out of pics, here is one more:  Here's one more:    Μια χαρά ξεκίνησες Αντώνη. :-) Άντε καλές συζητήσεις σε όλους μας! https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=75126.msg2190488#msg2190488Is this for real? Namworld if that's true then you might be able to help them with anything you know about rando.Also, we should do that IRC meeting, if others are also interested of course. Who is Todd Peterson? Well done Isamaru! New pic: PS: Don't forget to look at the hints before you bet. Well right now it's hard. But I predict it will be solved quite early compared to other images. Of course my predictions are often wrong so you may as well ignore them. :-D Αν αναρωτιέται κανείς τι είναι αυτό το quote, είναι από εδώ: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=206246.0 That's part of the trick. You need to know when you should bet. Too early and you'll likelly fail, too late and you get nothing since someone else solved it first. :-)EDIT:One more easy pic:
Ξέρει κανείς δικηγόρους και λογιστές στην Ελλάδα που να μπορούν να δώσουν συμβουλές για Bitcoin; Ακριβώς αυτό. Τόσα braincycles καλύτερα να τα αφιερώνουμε σε νέες υπηρεσίες. Το Bitcoin δεν προσπαθεί τίποτα. Εκ των πραγμάτων ένα ανώνυμο νόμισμα θα βολέψει για μαύρες αγορές, δεν χρειάζεται καμιά προσπάθεια. Πριν το Bitcoin ο κόσμος στις μαύρες αγορές προσπαθούσε και με άλλα ηλεκτρονικά νομίσματα να κάνει δουλειά, με μικρή όμως επιτυχία. Το Bitcoin, πραγματικά, απλοποίησε τις αγορές αυτές πάρα πολύ.Αυτό με τα alt-coins και εμένα με παραξενεύει. Τα περισσότερα δεν διαφέρουν ουσιαστικά από το Bitcoin. Το namecoin OK έχει άλλες χρήσεις. Το PPcoin μπορεί να είναι το μέλλον των κρυπτονομισμάτων (τεχνολογικά τουλάχιστον) αν καταφέρει να ξεπεράσει κάποιες δυσκολίες του. Αλλά ακόμα και το Litecoin δεν είμαι σίγουρος ότι προσφέρει κάτι. Ευτυχώς φτιάχτηκαν κάποια site που μπορείς να το χρησιμοποιήσεις αλλιώς εμένα μου φαινόταν ένα νόμισμα για όσους ήθελαν να κάνουν mining με την CPU τους. Πραγματικά δεν μπορώ να εξηγήσω γιατί έχει σχετικά πετύχει. Ας μην μιλήσουμε για το Feathercoin που είναι πρακτικά κλώνος του Litecoin. Εγώ προβλέπω να πέφτουν στην αφάνεια σχετικά γρήγορα.EDIT: Για να μην παρεξηγηθώ. Να πεφτουν στην αφάνεια σε σχέση με το Bitcoin κυρίως. Γενικά τα cryptocurrencies μπορεί να ανέβουν (όλα σχεδον) πολύ όσο το Bitcoin γίνεται γνωστό. Αλλά νομίζω ότι τα Bitcoin θα τα αφήσει πίσω τα περισσότερα αν όχι όλα.  Speculation.Το WoW Gold είναι εξ ορισμού περιορισμένο σε μια κοινότητα. Το Bitcoin δεν είναι πουθενά περιορισμένο. Δεν έχει EULA. Αυτή είναι μια βασική διαφορά του από πιστωτικές κάρτες, facebook credits, WoW gold και ότι άλλο.Γιατί είναι δυνητικά ανώνυμο, φτηνότερο, και δεν κάνει διακρίσεις. Όποιος θέλει το χρησιμοποιεί για ό,τι θέλει χωρίς να ρωτήσει κάποιο κράτος αν επιτρέπεται. Aetos το συγκεκριμένο άρθρο το έχω διαβάσει και είναι ελαφρώς τραγικό κατά την γνώμη μου. Καταρχήν για κάποιο λόγο προσπαθεί να διαψεύσει το ότι ο καπιταλισμός θα πέσει με το Bitcoin. Ποτέ κανείς δεν νομίζω ότι ισχυρίστηκε κάτι τέτοιο. Κάθε άλλο μάλιστα, το Bitcoin μπορεί να υποστηρίξει τον άκρατο καπιταλισμό.Τα περισσότερα points του απαντιούνται εδώ: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MythsΠαράδειγμα αστείου και αστήρικτου επιχειρήματος:Επίσης αυτό:κατά την γνώμη μου λέγεται "ζηλεύω αυτούς που πλούτισαν επειδή επένδυσαν νωρίς σε μια ριζοσπαστική τεχνολογία πριν καν μάθω για αυτήν και τώρα παρακινώ τον κόσμο να πουλήσει τα bitcoin του για να χάσουν τα λεφτά τους οι πλούσιοι που τόσο τους μισώ". You are right about this. My mistake to call it an IOU. The fact that BTC fees don't dissapear doesn't really matter. XRP's dissapear and their value simple get's spread over the remaining one's, everyone get's richer at the same time (well, richer in IOUs that is). The difference is that in bitcoin only Miners get richer since btc fees don't dissapear but are instead collected by them. ;-)Also don't forget that when Ripple gets open sourced (I hope it does in the end), everyone will be free to reimplement the protocol so that it doesn't need XRP to function. And I think this should definitelly be done to properly decentralize the network. Well by the same token Bitcoin has also got use value because it speeds up transactions if used as fee and is also needed for some transactions to ever go through. Ah OK. Didn't see any other bet at the time of your posting. :-) Was it "dory" or "palm tree"? I'm male BTW. Nobody else had bet "skull". You should click the "Wrong Answers" button before betting yourself if you didn't do that already. :-) Theymos I'll also gladly help with the Greek subforum.EDIT:Oh and I have quite some experience administering another big forum (although that one is phpbb). Haven't done moderation work though on it but I can definitelly handle it. Isn't that the BEST part about this game? :-D Our brain is amazing... I don't remember what the previous pic is, really. Haha.But I also uploaded a new one which is easy and cheap, IMO. New picture: Sorry or delaying with that but I had some bad trouble with my computer these days. 1pic/day. I'll increase the rate when I some more people start playing.@mem: there is one transaction visible in the transaction list now. Done: https://apopheniabtc.com/txs.phpOf course it will only show transactions that happen after today. The older ones are protected by the privacy policy. The new PP states that data related to bitcoin transactions and paybacks are public data. Which picture are you referring to, toothpicks? If you mean the one with Vulcan I only see one correct placed on it.That's a good idea that has crossed my mind too. I'll need to change the privacy policy first to note that payback addresses and bet addresses will be public data. I'll do that as soon as I get a chance. I'll place a link in the [Other] section that will take you to a page with all the transactions.Unfortunately there is nothing that can stop me from doing this. The pictures have to get into the system by a human (since they are unique pictures that cannot be found on the internet to avoid cheating with TinEye etc) so some human WILL ALWAYS know what pictures are in the system. Even if we had a system that you input pictures in batches of one hundred pictures each and then they are selected randomly, the human that inputs the batches would have a big advantage because he would be able to recognize the pictures much earlier than other players. Additionally he would know the exact answers. This has already been discussed a bit in previous posts in this thread, you may take a look if you are interested. To cut a long story, I can't think of any way to make this game provably fair. Of course this is not the first game that you have to trust the owner before you play. People have been investing time to go on TV games based on knowledge, meaning they trust that the TV channel will not cheat.I was experimenting with various custom effects. The initial one was very different from this one. It would start doing random walks on the picture. Each random walk would paint circles and ellipses underneath it. The color would be a mixture of the color it was stepping on, the color of the starting point of the walk, a random color and the color of an offset pixel. Too bad I didn't keep one of those pictures. It looked like some terrible oil painting. The bad thing about this effect was that as time passed on, fewer random walks remained, and parts of the original picture were clearly revealed. It was too easy to recognize which parts were revealed and which were still painted by some random walk so in the end it wouldn't matter how I painted underneath the random walks. I could just hide parts of the photo and it would have the same end result, just not so fancy.The new effect is based on the idea of duplicating the picture, offsetting the duplicate by some amount on X and some on Y and then applying that "triangle" effect. The triangle effect basically replaces every pixel with a triangle. It's done in two steps, first step places opaque triangles everywhere creating a confetti effect. Then on top of that I place a few more triangles that are transparent to create an effect that looks like broken glass or something. As time passes triangles get smaller and the offset picture is moved gradually back to it's starting position. I might make some changes these days to the algorithm though. You can put an auction for each one of them individually on Bitmit and then give us the links to the auctions here. I would take Crysis 3 for a low price on an auction if possible. ;-) You can try http://bitmit.net/en/?ref=1651 or http://www.bitcoinclassifieds.net/.What gift cards are those? The are passes to get the games for free? Please tell me that someone can answer this one. :-D It will expire in 6 hours. The pic is completely clear.
New pic!Would you guys be interested in having multiple ways to distort an image? Each image getting distorted randomly by one of the available algorithms? Nice work uncaer9. I was wondering why people hadn't solved that one yet. :-) 1. The player that got the hot wallet contacted me and offered to return it. :-) How cool is that??2. I added a new picture. It's a person. The starting pot is 6 times the bet. It's quite high compared to older pictures AND it has a bonus carried over from the expired picture. So it's a pretty high starting pot: 0.04375BTC for a bet of 0.005BTC (x8.75). And as I said yesterday I also increased the bet fee from 40% to 50% (in other words my breaking point is somewhat higher now but I think it's worth it). This is will expire in a few minutes!  He got 0.334BTC because of the bug. Plus the pot for the picture of course.  Really stupid bug... It took me some time to find what was really wrong. It turned out that while the whole site works on integers for prices, there was a point the price was not cast to an integer. So the value 0.00875 (his bet) was supposed to be converted to 875000 but instead it was some value very close to that which caused some comparison to always recognize the bet as something that was just paid and then, because the picture was already solved, the site kept returning the bet back to him over and over every 5 minutes until the cold wallet was emptied.EDIT:Tomorrow when I'll post new pictures, the fee will be 50% (it now is 40%) but the starting pot will be even higher: 6 times the bet (it now is 4x). This should reward more those that take their chances earlier. Some arithmetic bug caused the whole hot wallet to be gradually sent to the player that answered the Vera Miles picture.No worries though. The hot wallet had little money in it, the bug is fixed and I'm refilling the hot wallet in a few minutes. :-) The text one was harder than I expected. It took ~3 days just to reach the point where I start to see the text. Sorry for that I'll keep it simpler next time. Consider this picture to be added just now. ;-)Oh and I added one more picture:BTW do you people want higher or lower bets? I'm very happy that you like it AngryCatfish.There are many different ways the reward system could work and honestly they all seem fun to me. I choose this one because it guarantees that at some point, every picture will be worth betting on. The way it worst now the starting pot is 4 times the bet. So if by the time you are 25% sure that you know the answer, you HAVE to play. And if you miss, you increase the pot which probably means that someone that was 20% sure that he knew the answer, now HAS to play. In theory it can cause a chain reaction of bets, which I believe we witnessed on the "goldfinger" picture last week. I am a bit afraid that if the starting pot was decreasing, it MIGHT in some cases cause some of the harder pictures to be not worth betting on. If you start for example with 20% certainty about your answer and then, because of the improvement in the picture you get 5% certainty every hour but the starting pot decreases so it's always less than 1/certainty*bet then then nobody should be expected to bet on the picture. I would have to manually check pictures to evaluate whether they will be easy enough at some point to be worth the bet (which is impossible since my opinion would be highly subjective and biased).Bets are still few in numbers so I don't make any profit from this, just very minor losses. My ideas to cope with this currently are:1. Spend money on advertisement. The bad thing is that it looks like that most people that visit the site through ads don't place bets. The highest bet/visit ratio is the one from people coming over from the bitcoin wiki, this forum and through betwithcoins. Obviously this is because of better targeting. Maybe if I did a custom deal for advertising on some other site, or perhaps betwithbtc, I would get more players for the money spent.2. Do an IPO and sell shares to earn money and have a few people (the shareholders or "chairmen" voted by shareholders) to advise me on how these money should be spent to advertise and develop the site. Shares will pay dividends from the equity.3.Increase the starting bet AND also increase the fee. An idea would be startingpot=9*bet and fee=90% of bet. This would cause the chain reaction to happen earlier BUT it would also mean that multiple bets from a single player wouldn't make that much sense. Right now it's 4 times the bet and 40% fee so you can bet a second time to regain 60% of the previous bet plus the pot. 90% fee would mean you only recover 10% of your previous bet by betting again. In both cases (4x/40% or 9x/90%) the breaking point for me would be 10 bets per picture. That's when the site starts earning something.4. Increase the starting pot and keep the fee at 40%. This would mean that my breaking point would move to more than 10 bets. Making the starting pot 8x the bet would mean I need 20 bets to break even. I doubt that this is viable for the time being. I believe it will be viable in the future but I don't know how far this future will be so I don't won't to play with the starting bet, increasing it today just to decrease it next week/month.5. Make the starting pot 10x the bet and increase the fee for the first 10 bets to 100%. This means that in during the first 10 bets the reward will be huge so many different people will have an incentive to try one answer each (there is no way to win back your money spent during the first bets though so I don't expect a second answer for most players). After 10 bets have been accepted the fee is reduced to x% (x could easily be lower than 40% too at this point). This solution has a few problems. First of all it increases the complexity of the site, both for the development and the players. Secondly it will be somewhat hard to be certain whether you bet will fall into the first 10 or not, thankfully this uncertainty is one-directional: you expect it to have 100% fee and it ends up having less, which is not bad. If you expect it to have less than 100% it will never have more than what you expect. So my main objection here is the complexity but if people like this idea though I shall seriously consider it because it offers a middle ground between (3.) and (4.), it increases the starting pot, this rewarding early players more, while keeping my break even point the same (10 bets).EDIT:Two more pics:  Sorry for this. I had forgotten to add the answer "spiral notebook" (I didn't think of it even though we also call them like that in Greece) to the notebook picture. I noticed now while looking at answers given by other players and since nobody had solved it, I added the answer and revalidated the bets.The only bad thing is that AFTER the player that answer "spiral notebook" someone (else) had submitted the other correct answer "notepad" BUT he/she hasn't paid for it fully. To get a refund for his pot though he will have to fully pay for the bet so that the site checks it. If he doesn't do so in the next day I'll try and do the refund manually. (The site will ONLY check/refund/reward bets that are fully or over paid) New text picture:EDIT: fixed the picture Can you please elaborate on the specific problems that you have with Costa Rica? "Access money" I suppose you mean it's not easy to withdraw money from that country's banks, right? What about the "legal structure"? Nope. Nothing has reached the "expired" state.I posted two new pics:  You're on fire lately. :-)It's a pity that someone had already bet GTA and someone else bet Clucking Bell none of the two bet the full title of the game.  An archive is something that I already think about implementing. I'll give it a try right now.Oh and here is a new pic:Today is movie/painting/game day. :-)Congrats Stunna for the scale. I didn't expect this picture to last that long to be honest. I don't think though that I will ever be able to technologically solve the problem of possible cheating. I mean even if there was a conceivable system that prohibits me from betting on my site you would have to trust that I am actually implementing it. But if you trust me with that, you could start me for not cheating in the first place. In theory I could give access to another person to verify that I have indeed implemented that system and allow him to do random checks on the server. But in that case you'll have to trust that the person doing the checks will not cheat himself since he will have to have root access on the server to verify that I haven't hidden any code that disables the system that prohibits me from betting. Let alone that I can't even think of a system to block me since I can always bet from an internet cafe for example.Huge distortion isn't bad. It just wastes time before someone makes the first guess. Nevertheless try reducing the max distortion a bit, I will do it over the next days because I don't currently have a way to change the maximum distortion just for the newly uploaded pictures. (I just reduced it by 6.6%)In the future, as more players join I'll place more pictures. Maybe as a first step I should aim to have only one "solved" picture on display, currently I've noticed on average 2 to 3 pictures. This will mean that'll I'll post more than one pic per day. I'll consider starting this tomorrow.Thank you both for the suggestions. ;-) Today is Hintless day, the most difficult of days! Starting pot is 0.015. :-) Sorry for this. The text on the bottom right corner is just the name of the site that I put on every picture so that when they are linked outside the site, people will know where they come from.I sent you back your bet to the payback address you had entered, removed the bet from the system (since no one else had bet after that) and placed a check so that no one bets again on this answer in the future.Nocube was it you that bet on it? Exactly. As long as I have access to the server, which I don't think can ever be avoided, there will always be trust "issues". Actually even if we were picking pictures from a pool randomly and even if I didn't have access to the server, someone would have to fill the pool manually (photos are not automatically grabbed from the internet to avoid cheating by TinEye or Google image search) and that someone will have a huge advantage guessing the pictures. Escrows again won't help, you'll just have to trust them instead of me and it makes the whole system more complex to administer.  Thank you csw.Nothing, really, and I don't see any way to make this "provably fair". I'll have to build up trust in the community over time. You can talk to other players, or check that winnings are being to actual people. For example Boelens above won a pot of 0.14BTC you can talk to him about how many times he played etc if that means something for you. (edit: I just saw that Boelens had already answered to you about this)The initial idea was to allow players to upload their own challenges but trust issues would be even worse there. The I though about the players suggesting new challenges but again there are trust issues. In the end I decided that the best that can be done is to have only one entity that needs to be trusted (me). People already do that in many cases. TV trivia games for example. You can never know if the channel has agreed with your opponent to tell him the answers and then split the winnings. Yet people do spend time and in most cases money to go on such games.If anyone has any idea how to make it easier to trust that I ain't cheating, tell me. I mean other than closing me into a room with no mean of communication. :-) Another idea would be to force people to come out and claim their prize so that other players know that they are real people but that would be very aggressive in my opinion and most people wouldn't accept that (I, for one, would not). But I really appreciate people voluntarily coming out and publicly saying they won. (Like Stunna did while I was typing this message  ) I uploaded a picture with text. Let's see how this goes.  I will do that now nocube, thanks for the tip. (EDIT: it's done)BTW I am thinking about starting posting pictures according to a 6 day rotation schedule:Day 1: Hintless!Day 2: Movie or game (I'll be asking for the title)Day 3: Object, place, animal or plant (I'm asking for how we call it)Day 4: Person (I'll be asking for a real or a character name) *Day 5: Random, with hint.Day 6: Text (I'll type some random word on the picture with some random font, and the first to find what it says wins) *** I need some opionions on this one. Three cases:I put Freeman playing God in the picture and:1. I am asking for a character name OR I am asking for a real name.2. I am asking for a name and I accept both real and character names as correct answers3. I am asking for a name but I only accept one of the two as a correct answer.I think 1 is the best. 3 is more luck based and 2 doesn't allow for clever pictures. I mean it would be fun to have to guess the character every now and then instead of the name so that if someone recognizes actors easily he won't have an advantage when asked to guess the character's name. What do you say? 1 or 3? 3 is more luck based. 1 is probably the best IMO.** This has never been done until now so I might consider today day 6 and start the rotation but I need to hear some opinions first.
Thanks Micon. :-)Yes bitcoin really opens new doors in games. Imagine this site with PayPal: it would need user accounts, I would be risking chargebacks, there would be a minimum deposit (probably something like 10 euros) and a minimum withdrawal amount too (if you don't want to pay half of it in fees). Right now anyone can come and play 0.25 euros in a picture and possibly receive his winnings in 15 minutes without ever creating an account, never giving any personal data, even using Tor if he wants! I know... :-| And you found that quite early too. I was expecting either you or someone else to start trying specific movie titles at that point but none did.Tough luck this time for you. :-| Did you know which movie it was?(BTW it's not prohibited to team up with other users and share the rewards)Oh and a new pic is up... Congratulations Boelens. :-DThat's the biggest pot that has been given up to now.I'll be posting a new picture in a few minutes. :-)This one will have a hint.Although I think the hintless picture experiment was a success. Many people bet on it so I guess they liked it. It's way harder to find what it is but most importantly you need a little more luck too. I guess I'll post a hintless pic every now and then. That's a big difference. You might want to report this to the developers of Electrum if you are sure.Those two agree that you've sent 0.00625 BTC:http://blockexplorer.com/tx/90cfa8c36b6a5fd901e0521e1ae664449ba383678d1c645a5cb147e902667ca5https://blockchain.info/tx/90cfa8c36b6a5fd901e0521e1ae664449ba383678d1c645a5cb147e902667ca5 According to https://blockchain.info/tx/90cfa8c36b6a5fd901e0521e1ae664449ba383678d1c645a5cb147e902667ca5 you sent 0.00625 BTC to 1CX1gnDn7DTt9okfHYkFbz7jY5yjJTou3C which is a betting address for the picture that hasn't got a hint which indeed needed 0.00625 BTC per bet.Maybe you wanted to bet on another picture? I can try, this once, and move your bet to another picture if you want, since it is quite obvious that the answer has no connection whatsoever to the picture you placed the bet on. :-)(I'm going to sleep in a while so I can't guarantee that I'll manage to move the bet today) Also someone has set his referral address to an address starting with 1dice. If this is a SatoshiDice address then I really don't understand what he is trying to accomplish by sending referral earnings to that. The winnings (if any) will just bounce back to Apopheniabtc. The site might also think that the earned money is overpaid by someone user and try to send him back the difference. So in the end either the site or some random user will take the winnings.In the past someone had also used a 1dice address as payback and then, probably on purpose, paid to that address after having already solved the picture from another address. So the site sent the bet back to that dice address. Again I don't understand what's the purpose of this. :-)Anyway I am just trying to warn anyone who tries this that he/she might loose money this way. IMO It would be unfair to place a hint on it right now. Some users will see it first and might be able to solve it while other users are sleeping and have already bet even though they had no hint. If I was a player I would expect the rules for the picture to stay the same throughout it's time. If your complaint is generally about pictures without a hint then I shall consider it though. I should do a vote or something about this.Yes if you bet more you are getting the extra back minus 0.001 or 0.0005 (I don't remember the exact amount right now). You may PM me (or post publicly if you don't mind) the address you paid to if you want me to check up on it though. Define "same time".  Here is the procedure:The most important thing is when the bet was confirmed. 1 confirmation is enough btw. Now if two bets, both correct, are confirmed in the same block then the one that got into my database first gets checked first. The timestamps have a precision up to 1 second so if two people answer at the very same second AND their transactions get confirmed in the same block, then I don't know which one will be checked first. It's up to SQL to decide. :-P Does anyone really care about that case though? If it ever becomes an issue then I guess I'll just switch to millisecond precision. If you are going to tell any friends about it, don't forget to use your referral code. :-) I haven't seen a single bet from someone that came to the site via a referral. Images are updated every 10 minutes. Specifically I update 3 images every 5 minutes and there are usually 6 images on the site. (solved images are also "updated" even though this is useless and I might exclude them from the update rotation in the future)The page also automatically refreshes every 10 minutes so in theory you should be looking at different, more clear, pictures every time the page auto-refreshes. Now each image improves at a different rate though.Each image take 5 days to expire and they are reach their fully clear version when 5*90%=4.5 days have passed. The last 0.5 day will pass with the image being completely clear. (the 5 days expiration is configurable per image so it might change for some images) So if an image is uploaded with a 10 day duration to expire, it will still improve every 10 minutes but it will be improving in much smaller steps. Maybe we should join them? The picture without a hint is now giving 8+ times the (fixed) bet.All wrong answers given are understandable and some are quite on point but none is correct (obviously). :-) You mean the mustache? There is no beard. :-DI should remind people that you can view the full version of a solved picture by clicking on the thumbnail to open the picture dialog and then clicking on the big picture to alternate between the state the picture was when it was solved, and the final (perfectly clear) state of the picture. Whoever solved the "french kiss" picture... Well done. I am amazed that someone solved it this early...  Μάλλον τσάμπα. Το litecoinz.gr είναι ελεύθερο και είναι πιο ωραίο. Το ίδιο και το litecoins.gr. Γιατί και πόσο το πήρες; New one. I also added a little note on the bottom right corner of each pic since they were getting quite some hotlink hits and I guess it would be nice to guide people to the site. I hope it's subtle enough. :-) Feeling lucky? The new picture has no hint.  Here is a new pic: This one is almost clear now. In 18 hours it will expire in which case I'll have to move the accrued bets to another picture's pot. New pic:  @haitispaceagency you mean the one that someone answered "simpsons"? BTW you can copy image URLs here on the forum like I did above. Just use the tag this way:Code:[img height=150 width=150]https://apopheniabtc.com/processed/a8658a7b65a31bcf33618b6e4ddf11b6c7743a03ec5fad6ca7e81beff2c6e847[/img]
@Stunna and haitispaceagency thanks for the kind words. :-)@haitispaceagency no it's not from fear and loathing in las vegas. BTW you can see wrong answers by clicking "wrong answers" on the bottom right corner of the dialog that opens if you click on the picture's thumbnail. Are you the poor guy that was stuck betting Venice related answers to the hippo picture? I really felt bad about that guy. It was apophenia (wikipedia article) at it's best. For example if you can see a well known actor in that pic I do NOT want his name. I am asking about the title of the movie that this is taken from.This is not the only case that the hint will ask for a title. Maybe I need a game title. Maybe it's a song video clip. I need the title of the work, not the person depicted, not the objects depicted etc.Hints are usually there to avoid having users trying to find something that I am not asking for. For example I might be showing a person wearing a specific type of hat. The hint could be "need the name of the item" or "what is he wearing" (if I need the type of the hat) or "need the name" (if I need the persons name)(The explanation that I gave is generic. They should not be considered hints for any of the pictures that are right now on Apophenia.) Maybe I posted this in a wrong subforum at first so I'll also post about my new site here.Here is the site: https://apopheniabtc.comYou guess what some distorted pictures are in order to win their pot. To guess you you have to bet a fixed amount. A portion of this amount gets added to the pot if your guess is incorrect. Pictures also get less and less distorted as time passes by (even if no one bets on them). Also pictures have a starting pot, paid by the site. The game needs mostly skill and only a little luck. You should find the perfect time to bet. Too early and you will probably be wrong. Too late and someone else will solve the challenge first. Also in some cases multiple bets might be the way to go instead of waiting for the pic to clear.The site is beta (read the ToS) so please report any bugs if you see any. I'm posting news mostly on Twitter @apopheniabtc.Currently traffic and bets are quite low so, for now, most players earn more than they spend. Give it a try.Oh and when you place a bet (even if you don't pay for it), you'll be given a referral link.Have fun. I've set up referral links if anyone's interested. You can either make them by yourself by appending your bitcoin address to https://apopheniabtc.com/?partner=ORyou can place a bet (no need to pay for it, just place one) with a valid payback address and you will be given your referral link at the bottom of the dialog that will be telling you where to send payment.You'll get 5% of the fees on the bets of people you refer. We should schedule a talk over IRC. Anyone want to start a doodle (www.doodle.com) about it? Two more winners. Two challenges still unsolved. I'll upload new challenges tomorrow. Και έχει λάθη. 1. Και κρυπτονόμισμα είναι, και κρυπτογραφία χρησιμοποιεί, δεν διαφωνώ σε αυτά. Εγώ απλά είπα ότι είναι λάθος να λες τον SHA, αλγόριθμο κρυπτογράφησης. Είναι κρυπτογραφικός αλγόριθμος κατατεμαχισμού. Πες τον κρυπτογραφικό αλγόριθμο αν θες να το πεις απλά και σωστά. Αλγόριθμος κρυπτογράφησης σημαίνει ότι κρυπτογραφεί ο ίδιος. Κρυπτογραφικός αλγόριθμος σημαίνει ότι έχει σχέση με την κρυπτογραφία (ως επιστήμη). 3. Όπως και στο 1, απλά λέω ότι είναι λάθος. Το ότι θες να εκλαϊκεύσεις κάτι είναι πάρα πολύ καλό αλλά μπορεί να γίνει και χωρίς λάθη και για αυτό επεσήμανα όσα είδα.

Απλά μην λέμε ότι τα λάθη είναι σωστά εφόσον είναι γραμμένα σε εκλαϊκευμένο κείμενο.4. Χμμμ... Αυτό το παράδειγμα χάνει λίγο το νόημα νομίζω.

Αυτό που μετράει είναι το αν έχεις μεγάλο κομμάτι τις ισχύος ώστε να βρίσκεις block πιο γρήγορα από τους "καλούς" miners. Δεν υπάρχει τίποτα που να μπορείς με ωμή δύναμη να σπάσεις, ούτε σε 10 ούτε σε 100 χρόνια. Αντίθετα αν κάποιος είχε το 51% της ισχύος του δικτύου στα χέρια του τότε εντός ώρας θα μπορούσε να κάνει double spend τα δικά του χρήματα. Ακόμα και τότε όμως ΔΕΝ θα μπορούσε να κόψει παραπάνω νόμισμα από όσο έχει προβλεφθεί. (αν δεν κάνω λάθος)@ccplzΗ Πειραιώς στέλνει SEPA έμβασμα στο Bitstamp.net με 0.5 euro.

Good luck getting hold of Rando. :-| This one is getting a bit easy IMO:I also had to change the fees to make this viable since the starting pots are paid by the site and they are quite the expense. :-) I will adapt the fees to keep the game fair and viable as more people join. FYI I'm still on the negative side here, so there is no reason not to play. ;-)Also if any user from here won the previous three pictures I would appreciate it if you could confirm in this thread that your received the pot. This is also becoming too easy: (solved now!) Rough translation:EDIT: just saw that I replied a bit late. Wow....http://news247.gr/newspapers/Afternoon/eleftheri_ora/eleytherh_wra.2204019.html We got our first winner!"Someone bet 0.0025฿ and won 0.0123฿!"I had made a mistake in the answers. I fixed it as soon as I was aware of it an nobody was affected by it. I had typed the answer "clock" the answer "alarm" but I forgot to type in the answer "alarm clock". EDIT: Here is the specifics in case someone is interested:1. Someone bet "alarm clock". His bet was confirmed very fast but I had forgot to type that answer so it was counted as wrong.2. Someone placed bets, for "clock" and "alarm clock" (again). The bets took a while to get confirmed though. Actually they took A LOT to get confirmed.3. I saw my mistake so I added "alarm clock" as a correct answer and forcefully made the site recheck the first "alarm clock" bet.4. The site awarded the first bet for "alarm clock" with what was the pot at that time.5. The "clock" bet gets confirmed. It is correct but the picture is already solved so it is refunded back to the player.6. The second "alarm clock" bet never gets confirmed. (was never paid) EDIT: solved!The last one only has 24 hours to go, and it's improving fast. Added Terracoin and Devcoin.
Ouch. Thanks for the correction.EDIT: Forgot to answer to the rest of the post.If pictures are hard for you just wait for them to get better. Indeed most of them are impossible to solve at the very beginning, this is more or less intended. Otherwise I would have to manually pick the amount of distortion needed for each picture which is subjective. So it's better to start higher and let it become easier gradually until some user is able (or thinks she is able) to solve it. Here is what I'll do. I'll change one of them to be improving much faster so check it out during the next 2 days. One of the pics will be getting better fast. I made a new game playable with bitcoins.You guess what some distorted pictures are in order to win their pot. To guess you you have to bet a fixed amount. A portion of this amount gets added to the pot if your guess is incorrect. Pictures also get less and less distorted as time passes by (even if no one bets on them). Also pictures have a starting pot, paid by the site.The site is beta (read the ToS) so please report any bugs if you see any. I am also waiting for any suggestions that you have.Here is the site: https://apopheniabtc.comRelated reddit post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bzoe4/i_made_a_new_game_with_bitcoins_apopheniabtc/ You sure that it really matters if the law recognizes them? We could simply say that we gave him 20K dollars (or whatever was the equivalent back them) in bitcoins. How much would that be BTW? Why not?

Δεν έχει κάποιο sticky στο newbie section;Τι είναι το atlantis; Δοκίμασε να το πουλήσεις στο http://bitmit.net αν θες ή στο http://www.bitcoinclassifieds.net/ Added IXcoin and PPcoin. We've almost reached 1000 users. :-)I hope to make customizable graphs in the next version. FYI: The bank of Cyprus (in Greece) has disabled its e-banking system in Greece so it's hard to send SEPA to Bitstamp from that bank right now. If rando is lying about not having money to pay back, then we should go after him. Would anyone be willing to pay so that we ask a lawyer if we can do something about this situation?If rando is indeed telling the truth then obviously going after him would only cost us more...So which one is the case?Do we know what country rando is residing in? This guy is Thai. Is Rando Thai? He got the scammer tag. Anyone heard of him via email? It's still early to say but form a few conversations the main reaction of the people is: "with what right did they seize 10% of the savings?". I don't see why people think that this is different from taxation and inflation though.As for the effect. I have no idea. That's exactly my thoughts. It's not urgent and I know his backlog is long enough already. But still those bugs lately worry me a bit. Should I base my site's payment system on blockchain.info? Would that help piuk or should I back off for a while (meaning I'll also have to switch to some other payment processor) till bugs are becoming more rare? Yeap. But it just got fixed. I again see the correct balance. What was that?EDIT: Although this problem might not be limited to this one address. I try to pay using the Android app and it gives me an error: "Error Response an output is already spent. (also got fixed now) Also something unrelated: I'm pretty sure that this address doesn't have a 60BTC balance. https://blockchain.info/address/1Pxbqi5UnkdiVp7VNq1Ej7n4FtMrKKEvvYMy wallet suddenly shows an extra 60BTC because of this address even though that address shows no recent transactions. I got this HTTP callback: (sensitive parameters removed)Code:callback.php?anonymous=false&destination_address=18yeQBiy8YCLLKdHHwK8nRetRz4G2vteYQ&confirmations=1&address=18yeQBiy8YCLLKdHHwK8nRetRz4G2vteYQ&value=-50001&input_address=18yeQBiy8YCLLKdHHwK8nRetRz4G2vteYQ&input_transaction_hash=0b5f18956d8d589cf2bd1b4b01But I've set up my wallet to send notifications for received transactions only. What's that -50001 value? Why is it negative? It looks like it notified me about an outgoing transaction. When http notifications are back, will we also get all the missed notifications? Also is there a way to tell when http notifications are off so that I can disable payments in my sites automatically? (Other than doing payments to myself I suppose)Good luck with the new server piuk.   Everything but http callbacks seems to be working. Anyone else having trouble with http callbacks? (http notifications) Site is back up. API seems good but I don't get https callbacks for new transactions. Does anyone else have this problem? I don't think that's his portrait. How do you know it's him? He still hasn't contacted anybody? He said he would be contacting his shareholders by email, did he do that?
Still no word from him?Last Active:   February 20, 2013, 07:42:01 AMBut no posts since Feb 5... Question: When price exceeds the limits and a desktop notification is shown should I change the limits? Specifically:1. If you set a high limit at 31 and the current price climbs to 31.2, should I increase the high price to 31.2?2. Should I leave the limits as they are but instead never show a new notification unless the price first falls back in the limits?3. Maybe it would make sense to widen the limits to include the *average* ONLY if the average also goes off limits? (I think this would be confusing for the users that don't know this detail though so I'd rather avoid this solution)Currently it will just keep poping up the notification every 5 minutes as long as you don't change the limits manually. It's done, in cased you missed the server notification.And in case anyone is interested in the details here is how I calculate the average currently:This runs every minute: (but doesn't necessarily query Bitstamp and MtGox every minute)BitstampAverage=BitstampAverage*0.9872+CurrentBitstamp*(1-0.9872)BitcoinAverage=0.6*MtGoxAverage+0.4*BitstampAverage(MtGoxAverage is taken from https://mtgox.com/code/ticker.php which is API v0 so it's not the same as the one shown on their main page)0.9872 is chosen so that BitstampAverage is 99% affected by the prices in the last ~6 hours, 90% affected by Bitstamp prices in the last ~3 hours and 50% by the last ~54 minutes.I wish I knew what kind of average is the Mt Gox average in API v0 so that I could use the same for Bitstamp... I'll make it so that the average price takes Bitstamp into account too. The current price will still be coming from Mt Gox though since that's the one that changes the fastest. 1.8.1 is out.Changes:Desktop notifications for when the BTC prices exceeds some user defined limits.Now the current Bitcoin price is used instead of the average because the average looks like it is lagging (it is not). You can still select to use the average from the options page.Revamped the options page a bit.Server messages will pop up announcing new features, problems or whatever. You can turn those off from the options page.Changed the tooltip of the Biticker button to show BOTH average and current rate.Put a big icon that opens the option page on the top left corner of the currency converter in case someone doesn't know how to open option pages in Chrome.Fixed SLL rate.Thanks to everyone for the feedback! Instead of withdrawing 1BTC of earnings to a Bitcoin address I choose to deposit that 1BTC to a fake campaign I own that has a 0 budget and I pay a 0.1BTC fee for that. Then (if you make it possible in the future) I withdraw the money from the campaign paying x% fee on the 0.9BTC. If 0.9*x%+0.1<0.2 then I will always use this method instead of directly withdrawing money. So if you implement a way to withdraw money from campaigns you should choose an x% fee that doesn't encourage people to go through this to avoid fees. Forget this, you can withdraw money without paying a fee...What are goals in relation to ad units? I though ads had goals, not ad units.BTW if you intend to explain all these stuff in your FAQ then there is no need to answer here too, I can wait. On the other hand this QA is free bumps... Hehe.EDIT: Aaaaaah I get it. I can withdraw coins from my campaign by creating a fake (or not) ad unit and then pay up that unit directly and the withdraw the money for free since withdrawals don't cost anything. Thanks for the explanation. I didn't know that you kept the old payment system. (Being able to pay directly to your best ad units) You should probably clarify this on the FAQ and highlight that there is no fee for doing that (it's one of the best features of the old and the new AA).EDIT3 is fixed on stage IMO. The "than to withdraw to bitcoin address and then deposit to campaign" explains why I would want to select that option. ;-)So to verify that I fully understand how it works. (use that or something like that in your FAQ if you'd like)Alice is referred to AA by Tom. Alice creates an ad unit so that she can earn money on her blog. She set's up her ad unit to automatically deposit that money to one of her campaigns in order to advertise her blog too. She sets her daily budget to 0.1BTC. She does NOT deposit any money directly, she just wait's for her earnings.Bob is referred to AA by Timmy. He creates a campaign to advertise his company and he deposits 1BTC to his campaign but sets daily budget to 0. Of that deposit 1BTC*80%=0.8BTC get credited to his campaign, 1BTC*10%=0.1BTC go to AA and 1BTC*10%=0.1BTC to Timmy. Bob then hand picks Alice's ad unit to put his ad in by paying all 0.8BTC to her ad unit. No fee is subtracted from those 0.8BTC at this point.Alice receives 0.8BTC which, as instructed, get directly transferred to her own campaign to advertise her blog. During that internal transfer 0.8*10%=0.08BTC go to AA. 0.8*90%=0.72BTC get credited to Alice's campaign. AA starts to automatically match up Alice's ads to various ad units. After 0.72/0.1=7.2 days Alice's balance is exhausted. At that point AA has charged additional 0.72*20%=0.144BTC fees and 0.72*80%=0.576BTC have been paid to the ad units that displayed Alice's ad.So MOAR questions for you:1. In the previous example, doesn't Tom get any money? Alice didn't deposite any money, she chose to do an internal transfer from her ad unit earnings to her. Referrals get a cut from the deposits, right?2. Can you withdraw money from a campaign if you choose to send your money there? I suppose not since that could be exploited unless it had a fee >>10%.3. Which ways do we have to refer people and where do we receive our referral fees? I just made three units. But I have a few questions.1. On the top right of the site I see this:  Ad #97, up to ~26752 impressions per day CartWhat is that supposed to be? I would expect to see some high traffic low cost Ad Unit at that place so if I wanted to avertise something I could easily add it to my cart. But this one is an Ad, not an Ad Unit. So why am I seeing this?2. The fee system needs to be explained a little better I think.20% of each deposit to campaign (or 10% of transfers from ad units balance)20% of campaigns daily budget.If I understand correctly that means that if Bob want's to advertise his website on Alice's website, he deposits 1BTC and sets a 0.1BTC/day budget. In the end 0.4BTC (40%) will be charged by AA.The other case is if Bob also has income from advertising other sites on AA and he transfers the money internally from his Ad Unit to his campaign. In that case 0.3BTC (30%) will be charged in total by AA.Am I right?And some suggestions:I was very confused when I saw the option to withdraw my BTC from my Ad Unit to a campaign. It took a trip to the fees section for me to realize what it means to send money to a campaign (it is done to take advantage of the lower fees). I was at a page that was supposed to setup an ad unit, the last thing I was expecting to see was an option for users that want to advertise. IMO you should put a text like "If you are also advertising through AA and you want your earnings to be deposited directly to your advertisement campaign, please specify your campaign ID here." so that users realize this is only useful if they are also advertising things on AA.I think you should lower your fees a bit. Take a look at your competition:Operation fabulous charges 5% of withdrawals.Adf.ly charges ~50% IIRC but they are using PayPal which ads risk and fees on it's own.BitcoinAdvertising.com charges 2% although I'm not sure if that site has any users. Project Wonderful charges ~25% but is also using PayPal.I know they are all different services and you cannot compare directly to them but still...Good luck with the new site. I really like your service! :-)EDIT: Also why is there a "health: 0%" stat for ads that are not associated with a website? (eg: http://a-ads.com/ad_units/347) Is therea way to make this health go up?EDIT2: I already got ads on two of my units. And I think I found a bug: The add has an underlined title, a line of text and a url on the bottom. Clicking on the title opens a new tab (as it should) but clicking on the url in the third line opens the advertiser's website INSIDE the ad iframe!EDIT3: Create new ad unit. Click custom colors. Type a value in one of the color text fields. Click another field. Now how do I turn the first field back to "default"? If I clear its contents it types #ff0000 by itself. Any news from Rando? Did we lend our BTC to that guy under a completely different contract, or did we buy his bITBOND perpetual mining bonds from him with an added promise that he will buy back at some specific point? So the guy has actually defaulted but doesn't accept it. So instead of liquidating everything and giving back to the bondholders whatever he can so that they themselves decide how to recover their losses, he keeps whatever money is left + equipment and demands that he should be the one to do the damage control by mining with ASIC. (which he also divides equally over all investors even though the big ones didn't pay for them)He just keeps violating his contract on and on... He is really amazing, it's not just his nickname.Let's wait a few more days for Namworld to grab a hold of him on Skype. Well AmazingRando hasn't even showed up. A theory was that when BFL ships his ASIC's he will show up and perhaps pay up. Honestly I've started to doubt that.Now if he doesn't show up how would you say we should go after him? Can he be sued or something?Allegedly BFL will start shipping in two weeks but that's another thing I have trouble believing in... Still waiting for 10%. (not much though) So we'll just wait till ASICs ship?I want to see how will he'll justify not talking for half a month+. "I was in the hospital."?In any case I don't think that hiding is a good idea. He could just show up and promise to pay his forced "loan" with a higher interest than what anyone would get if he/she had invested the dividents in an average ASIC mining company. I suppose most people would accept the offer if he also admitted that he messed things up. Do you people think he just took off? OR did he honestly mess things up and now for some reason doesn't even answer?I mean why would he move the shares to cryptostocks first? He could just take off before doing that... Does anyone know him personally? Or, in case he actually runs with the money, a scammer tag is the only thing he'll be getting?EDIT: By personally I mean if anyone's got a name. And of course I don't ask for anyone to post anything here... Ah perfect... Now he's (AmazingRando) going to get a scammer tag: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=136803.0And he's still missing, right? When did he say that? It looks like Amazingrando answered (partially?) to BIT-BOND owners about their dividends or some.Aaaah this GLBSE shutdown has stirred up a lot of trouble... It now remembers the last value your wrote and whenever you reopen the converter window it will be loaded at the proper place and all conversions will be updated. So for example you might want to input "1" into XAU (Gold ounces) to see the current gold price immediatelly whenever you open the window.Also as I said in my previous edit, currencies are color coded. Yellow for precious metals, green for fiat, blue for cryptocurrencies and light green for linden dollars which is fiat but maybe even worse. ;-) Ah I read pollclosed (that is some poll in the first message is now closed).
Trying to set up my address:Also at the left sidebar: Added Namecoin and Litecoin. Also centralized and mirrored all the currency data on my servers so that permissions asked are even fewer and all exchange rates can now be fetched in a single request. I also mirror the two default graphs on my server to avoid straining bitcoincharts since the Biticker's userbase is growing.Next version will properly utilize the new Chrome API so that the whole thing might use less RAM and CPU (although neither has ever been in issue IMO). In other words I will remove the background page of the extension and replace it with alarms or what you have (I don't remember how Chrome calls them).Are there any other weird/virtual/crypto currencies that you would like to be added? Or normal currencies of course.EDIT: 1.6.0 is out which adds color codes to currencies and a few more currencies. Great!  Tell us what we need to do when you are ready Namworld. O_O When did this happen? I have never seen this website. It's not even on the trade page on the wiki. (registering now) Has anyone discussed ideas regarding how the operation will continue? (or if it continues?)Will it be listed on another website? Maybe on http://picostocks.com/ or https://cryptostocks.com/ ? Picostocks seems interesting. Isn't legal tender supposed to mean that if you go to any shop you can use them to buy something? If that's correct then they are not. Shop owners aren't even obliged to accept Austrian Philharmonic gold euros for their face value (not that anyone would ever use them for their face value since it's extremely low). Let alone Maples or Eagles. Well honestly the Greek guy was an asshole for not returning the money in the first place. But Roger from Bitcoinstore was really lame to post his name on a forum. They both messed up.In the end I believe that Roger is a great guy that got angry by an obviously rude and lying customer (but not a scammer) and published his details on the forum. He shouldn't have done that. Also the whole fuckignthedeadbodyofrogersmom case is ridiculous and I wonder why Roger even mentioned it and insists that's it's a threat.EDIT:Also The fact that roger looked into Blockchain.info's database to expose a client of his other site (bitcoinstore) feels... not right.Although I wouldn't go as far as to say that it is immoral. But it's bad for business I think. :-) Translation of the above (I will post my answer afterwards): Added:XAU: Gold ounce      XAG: Silver ounce      XPT: Platinum ounce      XPD: Palladium ounceNow it must be the only converter that supports bitcoins, second life dollars and precious metals. ;-) I just have an account at pyramining. I still don't trust them. I mean if they get enough people joining and depositing they could be easily running an actual pyramid scheme without any mining involved at all. I believe they have posted photos of their mining hardware somewhere once (haven't seen them though) but that's not enough to trust them IMO. I mean they don't even publish an address and we only know what country they are in so at any time they can sell their mining hardware (if any) grab the money and make like a tree and leave.Does anyone have more info about them? Or invest in a mining company. :-)They can buy hardware and mine for you. Preferably don't invest in mining bonds though.Although with GLBSE down it must be somewhat harder. You can either go for something automated like Pyramining (yay I finally used my referral somewhere!) if you trust them or hand in hand transaction with one of the past GLBSE issuers. (check out BTC-MINING, it seemed like a good case) (BTW Wikipedia says that "It trades against other major currencies at floating exchange rates.". So I guess you can sell it back for fiat currencies.)Which probably means that its one way only on Hub Culture (the social network that issues Ven) they "print" new Vens in exchange for fiat money. If that's true, even Diablo3 gold is a better currency than this since you find it by actually doing something (killing stuff in a game) and Blizzard doesn't just "print" Diablo3 gold because someone is paying them a price.Although I don't really get what this means: So they print it whenever someone pays up to them to buy Ven but the price they ask is based on a combination of prices of multiple currencies etc? From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ven_(currency)Not that out government is sane in any way but why would they trust the virtual currency of a social network based in Hong Kong?EDIT: I thought you meant VC = Ven. Sorry. Disregard my message. Which virtual currency do they use exactly? Ven? (BTW I've never heard about Ven before) Power is getting more expensive here latelly. Not sure how up to date this is: http://www.ionianeco.gr/thermanse/thermanse/deixreosi.htmlSo it goes from 0,08436 EUR/KWh to 0,14798.I'll find a bill and see the exact prices.I used to use Mt Red just for fun. Well it's legal for very specific cases like sending money to a friend or a student abroad. Utter bullshit as you said. All banks I've heard of don't ask about the reason why you send money. ESPECIALLY for amounts like 100 euros... Yet that one does. So if you intend to buy BTC you should think twice before using Κύπρου. Also Τράπεζα Κύπρου (Bank of Cyprus) phones you to ask why you send money abroad. And they say it's illegal to send money abroad using bank transfer (like SEPA or the common internation transfer) to buy good or services. So I did a SEPA transfer to Bitstamp using Winbank (Piraeus' ebanking system) costed me 0.5euros. It took about 3 bussiness days (5 days in total because of the weekend) for Bitstamp to deposite the money to my account. I sent about 100 euros which got converted to USD by Bitstamp for free (with quite a good conversion rate; I mean if I let my bank do the conversion instead it would cost me more) and then I paid 0.5% fee to buy bitcoins with an instant order which took about 10 minutes or so. So everything went smooth, if anyone from Greece want to buy bitcoins, bitstamp looks like a nice solution (Mt Gox needs verification and stuff).@imanikin: how do you even email the CEO of a greek bank? :-D Cause anyone under him will probably have never heard of bitcoin. I mean, the clerks haven't heard of SEPA so it would take at least being a CEO to know about Bitcoin. :-P  'I want to link my Bitcointalk name with BTCJam's. Verification code: 8d5f875f-01e7-4fdb-841c-96da924762b3' Added INR (Indian rupee). Please suggest more currencies to add if I am missing yours.Openexchangerates is unfortunatelly no longer "open", it became a paid service. I switched to another source (that I host on my own).Oh I also enbled a new feature in Chrome Market and you can leave feedback or ask questions from the extension's page directly. (there is "give feedback" link or something like that)
I am also using winbank. OK I'll SEPA from there to Bitstamp. Thanks Seranata. I also noticed at the same time that my web banking charges 0.5 euros to send to Slovenia (bitstamp.net). I think I'll give bitstamp a try today. On the counter they charge 18 euros. WTF???Also if anyone has suggestions about exchanges that he/she has used, I'm interested to hear about them. Has anyone tried to buy Bitcoins from Greece?Most Greek bank clerks haven't even heard about SEPA (they are completely useless and unprofessional) and even those that know about it as for 8-15 euros per transaction, so unless I am buying 1000 euros worth of bitcoins it's not really worth it.Other ways?I could try with Paypal over OTR or find someone on the forums first (in hopes that he will trust me and consider the PayPal transaction risk free) but Paypal will be my last resort. BTW the TEM page is down again...   GTRANSLATION FOR ANYONE INTERESTED: I am greek. I moved to America 3 years ago. Greece is a country that I would happily spend my whole life! It's a shame that the economy is completely ruined and that we have such a weak government.Hi Konstantinos. Greece is nice for holidays mostly. If I could leave right now, I would, but I'll have to stay for a few more years here. As for the weak governement. It's not weak at all, it's just a terrible and serves certain lobbies. Other than that I think we would have more luck rebuilding the economy on our own without a government meddling in everything. Well we could, but the moment our government becomes actually weak (meaning it looses control over the police and the army) I bet quite a few Greeks (maybe almost half of them?) will easily accept a junta again as long as it keeps immigrants out of their neighborhood ad grants them basic healthcare. I shall send them an email tomorrow and see if they answer.  Which positions do you mean? Also not all pirates here like the idea of bitcoins. I've seen quite a few people that are into the Pirate Party only  because it's the only party they trust that it will allow them to affect how they are governed, while they themselves have socialist beliefs.To be honest I am not really sure how fast TEM is expanding if at all. Maybe someone else from Greece, Volos (the place where TEM started) might enlighten us. All I can say is that I live in Athens like 1/3 of the population and I haven't heard of a widely used TEM-like system here. I got a small leaflet while getting out of the Metro yesterday though. It was about some system called "κουκιά" (koukia.gr). It's sponsored by some companies but I still haven't checked it out.Yes, an exit would be an amazing (but painful for most) test. On the other hand the current situation is painful enough for many and there are times where I think that it would be easier for most people to live off of a black market if we parted from the eurozone. My only concern about the state getting "demolished" in one way or another is that most Greeks are practically unarmed and living in big cities. Even now the police is practically not functioning. It's not hard to imagine the people accepting another junta (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_military_junta_of_1967%E2%80%931974) just to feel safer. What a terrible article.The last one though wasn't that negative Serenata. I'd call it neutral perhaps. He doesn't state a negative opinion. He more like states his worries and that time will show if it's worth it or not. And compared to the average Greek reaction on the net I'd say it's quite positive.BTW Liberalism is almost unheard of in Greece. There are practically zero anarcho-capitalists for example while we've got a huge share of anarchists. So most positive opinions about Bitcoin here are based on the ability to escape austerity measures and live outside the current corrupt state.Also during the last elections voters were turned from the two "center" parties to the "left" and to the "right". But while "left" includes socialist parties, the right includes fascists and no libertarians at all. In the political compass (www.politicalcompass.org), Greece moved like this:From here: http://www.politicalcompass.org/printablegraph?ec=-5&soc=0To BOTH here: http://www.politicalcompass.org/printablegraph?ec=-7&soc=6and here: http://www.politicalcompass.org/printablegraph?ec=0&soc=9 (although those were much fewer thankfully)(those are personal estimates of course) Have you tried other terms? Try "sex" or "porn" and see how it goes. ;-) It's a quite good presentation of Bitcoin for the layman. It has some mistakes and misses a few aspects (it would be way more interesting if it presented Bitcoin along with some libertarian principles instead of just mentioning how today's governments are corrupt) but overall it's nice.Nope. We use almost exclusively Google like the rest of the world but there are fewer than 5mil internet users from Greece AFAIK so Google trends usually ain't that clear for us. I think Nefario shouldn't drop those "scams/high risk" investments out. Maybe create two markets in GLBSE would be better and manually move the good ones from the high risk market to the low risk one. And make the high risk market pages stand out as high risk. Something that will always remind potential investors that this could easily be a scam.Banning them outright has more less cons (pun intended) than pros. 1. Less profit for Nefario. 2. To much intervention in the market which goes against the "bitcoin spirit". Letting the people decide and giving them the proper tools to do so would be better.Of course in any case it's up to market own to decide what will be trades in the market. After all someone else will cover the demand for a high risk market if GLBSE backs out. I got this old bug where 2 step is enabled without ever enabling it. :-(And I noticed it yesterday so I will probably have to wait till Monday to withdraw some of my funds. (even though my ticket says it has been assigned) Everyone watch this page for news: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3046;sa=showPosts I also get the same message from CloudFlare. (For anyone wondering this is a CDN service that stands between the user and the site and caches anything that can be cached. When the site is down instead of getting the usual "cannot connect" error in your browser, CloudFlare serves its own page)So wait, some of us see wrong balances and some get the error? I was able to login and my balance was fine about an hour ago. What do you mean? Oh sorry I missed the thing about being unable to get the coins back before August. And you are right about getting the ASIC directly if the delays are comparable. Anyone? It's dropping already I think. Should we get that rig now?  I think we've got enough to buy an FPGA mini rig. Should we do a motion while the prices are high? Can anyone predict if the dividends will be higher than the current ones when we get the equipment? Of course we will be making more btc but 40% will not be paid as dividends. (suppose we go FPGA for the prediction)  Again, added 11 more assets to the list. They will be up to date in a few minutes.
Who is going to pay for every new person that goes into the TEM system? Every newcomer gets a fixed number of TEMs for free. If they are backed by bitcoins somebody should buy those bitcoins in the first place. Ah OK then. I got that the opposite way. Well yes for me then. One way or another we will move to ASIC IF there is such a hue difference in performance AND the initial Hash/$ ratio. If this vote doesn't pass, are we ordering the old mini rig soon? Also if we do, and can we trade it back for the full price to buy the ASIC one?Right now I lean towards voting No. We'd better buy something to start mining on our own ASAP and we'll switch to ASIC by trading the FPGA back. Or we could even get the FPGA now and use the rest of the shares for the ASIC when all of them are sold.Can I change my vote later? Anyone care to list the reasons to vote yes?  If anyone want to use anonymous ads in Phonegap apps for Android remember to include https://anonymousads.com to the cordova.xml file as an extra <access origin="https://anonymousads.com*"/> http://www.pirateparty.gr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=237&hilit=bitcoinBitcoin discussion in Greek Pirate Party's forum. It's a bit old though. There was medium sized discussion in the Greek Pirate Party's forum. More assets added.   If you look a few posts above you I was asking about that thing to. The answer was let's wait for the actual specs cause most people don't believe they'll be that high.On they other hand don't forget that 40% of the mined bitcoins are reinvested. So if things go as intended sometime we will probably buy ASIC hardware too.Also keep in mind that BFL promises (well, for what their promise is worth) that they will buy back FPGA miners at full cost when you buy ASIC from them. I have totally no idea how they are going to do that to be honest though. The same as the one that we got them at. For every 1BTC we gave him we will get the same 1BTC back. Aren't we buying their minirig though? Or you mean nobody trusts their specs or their delivery dates? http://news.yahoo.com/butterfly-labs-announces-next-generation-asic-lineup-054626776.htmlAny ideas when are those coming out?If we get the minirig, can we sell it back for $15000 as this article says? (or so I understand)Maybe we could spend the first 15K we gather in the new single units? We could get more than 10 of them for a total of 400Ghash/s.And then when we collect the next 30K we can get the new minirig for another 1Thash/s.I still can't believe those numbers. I am reading them again and again... Is this going to happen during 2012???EDIT: I just read on their site that they will deliver probably on October. My password is not even in that list. So I guess it's not all passwords as some say. Ten minutes ago, TV channel ALPHA aired an interview with some businessman (I don't remember his name) who proposed that Greece should default, go back to drachma and create a second, silver based coin without a fixed price to be used along with the fiat drachma. Interesting idea I'd say. I'd love to see Greece making the first non-fiat currency in Europe. But I doubt anyone will do that. He kept saying "all the government must do is give the people a good currency and they'll take care of everything else".They also mentioned Max Keiser and they said they will air his opinion tomorrow.Related: http://maxkeiser.com/2012/06/07/arriving-in-athens-today-with-hugo-salinas-price-on-hugos-g4-heading-out-now-for-a-live-tv-interview-to-talk-about-hugos-idea-for-a-silver-drachma-to-save-greece-from-the-banksters/ Updated the OP with more links to different formats (HTML,PDF,CSV,TSV).  Use the CSV to import to Excel and do shorting by any column etc... Specifically for that photo, it says in the description (Not on the public domain) because it's a game photo and not one that is actually sold. The game was here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=51897.0 There are a few photos like this one on bittit and they are all marked as not on the public domain.If you see the photo available on Google image search (bittit provides direct links to google image search and tineye search for that reason) then probably the image is not on the public domain. I check the high resolution versions myself before approving them but there is always the chance that a picture will on the internet later than its upload. If you find a higher resolution elsewhere then either the uploader uploaded the high res elsewhere (which I doubt since he/she was selling it in the first place) or the uploader doesn't own that photo and he/she just uploaded it to bittit before it got shared elsewhere on the internet.Other than that you can trust the red border pictures more because their uploader has been verified, meaning I've mailed them a code using certified mail and the verified that they got that code. So I at least know a street address that they can be found there. It's not foolproof but again many stock photo sites just ask for a ID card scan which can be easily photoshopped. Most Greeks with the ability to evade taxes, do so. Freelancers do so in most cases. On the other hand you wouldn't expect them not to evade taxes. When you see your neighbor evading huge amounts because his uncle knows someone in the parliament, you fell like an idiot for paying your taxes while the healthcare and the education system are utter crap and practically not even free. So don't blame Greeks for tax evasion. On the other hand you can blame most Greeks for voting those assholes in the parliament every 4 years, prolonging this unfair situation that even voters hate, showing a complete lack of reasoning and looking only how they make things better for themselves (in the short term).And as Serenata said, most Greeks that have a job work way more than the average European but produce far less than the average European and get paid far less too.If Europe wants to blame something on Greeks, it's the way they vote. We seriously haven't got the tiniest idea of how a democracy works. And most Greeks I've talked with don't even grasp simple notions like "personal freedom" or "coercion". And to be honest you wouldn't expect anything different if you take into account the education system here. Now it also gets the days between dividents automatically and uses the API to get everything.BTW a little tip about the colors in the spreadsheet. They are mostly useful for me. Blue means that they are updated by the script in the background. Yellow are cells with formulas. And green are cells updated manually by me when needed.I also added some more assets. I've hid the column for now. I'll consider putting it back in the future. Maybe I'll only do it for those that pay dividents since I can get that data automatically. Done and done. You broke up your last divident payment into three payments though so it is a bit messed up. If you pay in a single payment next month it will be fine. But the code currently just picks the last payment and uses that alone. Who did that? Or if we could find 10 greeks in the forum each one could give like 1 euro/month and start a facebook ad campaign targeted to people that would likely like bitcoin.
Bittit now supports and forces https. All links to bittit should continue to work though and I believe they will be automatically translated to https links. Would any of the shareholders be interested in tipping in to advertise this on anonymous ads or some other place?Currently I am advertising this on my chrome extension (using this link: https://bitly.com/Jer9UW+ ) which has brought about 20 clicks. arsenische drop us a line when you allow https for script ads etc cause I am switching bittit.info to enforced https and I need that too. :-) Well it depends on how much you want to pay. TV would be ideal.  But Facebook and blogs are good and free thought.  Never in the mass media. Few people know about it but I am trying my hardest,  hehe. Somebody make that poll somewhere if feasible.  I won't have proper Internet for two days.  I'll see if I can give more export formats when I get back.  Currently I parse the asset's page to see the dividents. That API would be helpful.  Are you looking for mods for the greek section, or calling out for the mods to create the subsection? :-) Α Greek subsection would be nice. I can help moderating if you want. Changed the title.Added BIB.PIRATE. It will fetch the divident automatically when it is first paid, I can't hardcode it into the spreadsheet.Added market capitalization. Which is (last price)*(securities issued). Is that correct? Added 007. No idea how I missed that...I didn't see anything wrong with PUREMINING. It's 1Mhash/s at 100% PPS (100%=1). What do you mean 007? I'll check puremining tommorow when I'll be on my computer again. :-)  Added more assets. I'll try to add market capitalization for all assets tommorow.  Just posting to say that Namworld (the user above me) answered to me when I emailed him at the email address on http://www.namworld.net/   So he is actually namworld.net. If you could give me some way to get the number of days needed to pay back the invested value I could add it and sort it in the list. Namword could you please mention BTC-MINING somewhere on http://www.namworld.net/ ? Just to make sure you really own that site/company. :-)Oh and will you buy more bonds as more people buy shares? Or are we going to split up the current bond dividents among all shareholders until you buy the rig?Best of luck. If they sell shares/bonds I might be able to include it somehow although I might need to make a few changes. Also I suppose there is no reason to include it if there is no market to sell and buy your shares/bonds.After I quick read through the FAQ on the site I think that it doesn't really fit into the list. If I am wrong correct me and I'll see what I can do.I also added more assets in the spreadsheet. I suppose this a more of a suggestion for GLBSE and not for the spreadsheet, right? Although if you can think of a better way to describe "perpetual mining bond" so that everyone understands what it is, then I'll change it in the spreadsheet. This also means that it only picks the best one and not one at random (weighted by activeRewardScore)? Hi Namworld. I really wish you good luck on that. I really hope this goes well. Have you considered the x6500 mining cards? The are more expensive but use even less power. I don't know if buying them in bulk would bring their price down closer to the mini-rigs.For the record I was mostly attracted by the mining split (10-40-50) which seem pretty rational to me.One question. When you sell about 3250 shares, you are logically going to buy the first rig. When you sell another 1000 shares, how are the profits going to be split? It will seem like our shares are diluted until the second rig is bought? Or will you consider buying mining bonds during that time? (like you did now, or directly on GLBSE)Best of luck. I will tell a friend to consider buying some shares too since he's got some BTC just sitting there...Also you should get on #bitcoin-assets if you don't do so already.Oh and do those rigs have any warranty?Edit: this is probably the most unstructured post I've ever typed. So let me get this straight. Describe the following as bonds or shares.1. Someones sells 1MHash at PPS100% per bond/share indefinitelly with the ability to buy back whenever he wants. My guess: Perpetual mining bond.2. Someone sells 1Mhash per bond/share minus expenses for electricity etc indefinitelly. My guess: share of a mining operation (I would describe it as "mining operation" on the spreadsheet).3. Somone sells shares to his mining operation without any guarantee about dividents or power per share/bond. My guess: same as the previous oneAm I right on those?Also what is the differences between bond and shares? As I get it shares NEVER have guarantees on the divident payments. If the company doesn't have profit, divident payments will not happen. On the other hand bond MAY have some guarantees on divident payments and MAY have a guarantee about buyback. For example "You buy this at 1BTC/bond, I'll be paying 0.01BTC per week in dividents and in 12 months I'll buy back the bond at 0.9BTC. Additinaly I reserve the right to buy back the bond at any time at 1.5BTC.". Now about this last one "the right to buy back whenever you want. How does it happen? I mean if there are no ask orders on the market how is the issuer going to buy back?And one last thing. When you do an IPO, and the people bid on the initial value of the asset, do you have to sell all of the assets issued? For example if I want to issue and sell 100 bonds at 1BTC/each and 50 people bid 1.5BTC/bond while another 50 people bid 0.9BTC/bond, what will happen? I suppose I would still issue an ask order 100@1BTC/each and only 50 people would get bonds from me (BTW at what price? 1BTC or 1.5BTC? Would there be any difference in this process is I was issuing shares and not bonds?So I'll change GIGAMINING etc into "perpetual mining bonds" and leave that that just share profits from mining as "mining operation".
Changed the name. The column would be nice but I have trouble telling them appart in quite a few cases. For now I've marked some of them in the description column as bonds. Bonds should be bought back at some point and don't pay dividents? Is that right?Oh and I added all symbols to the spreadsheet. Will add the ones on IPO if they are not already in. Smickles I am was just about to add as I am slowlly adding ALL symbols to the spreadsheet. Coul you tell me what short description I should use for it? Check the descriptions column to see what exactly I mean. (For now I'll leave it without a description)EDIT: Also do we know how often it is paying out dividents? I am pretty sure you can do what you say. Goals are optional. I can't promise I'll do that because of the way the spreadsheet works. I'll see if it's possible (without changing every script behind the sheet) after I finish adding all symbols to the spreadsheet. But it's a nice idea, especially having links to the threads in the forum. Do you people think I should expand this to all shares and bonds?The columns related to hash power would not make sense for other shares and bonds of course so I could either remove those columns or I could leave them empty.Also currently the last divident payment is what it say: the last payment (in BTC). Should I change that to weighted average of all divident payments?BTW there a few script running behind the spreadsheet that autoupdate some of the values. Soon I hope to make it almost self-updating. Ah thanks for the explanation.Oh, and I just made it free instead. Not even the column headers? You are supposed to download a file that contains only the headers. To increase the filesize you've got to pay at its address, wait for a while and redownload. Whenever someone tips into that address the file size will increase for everyone. So when 0.5BTC is collected everyone will be able to get the file for free. (as I said I'm just trying the waters here)I've seen this many times, but: what is "sub"? I collected all GLBSE assets on Google Spreadsheets using some simple scripts that pull the data from GLBSE and refresh the spreadsheet automatically. The spreadsheet is sorted by the time it will take for the dividents to pay out the cost of a share/bond. As some people said it's not good for every situation but it's good for mining shares.Formats⇒HTML *Best for online browsing*⇒PDF *Best for offline browsing*⇒CSV *Can be imported to Excel easily*⇒TSVColumnsSymbolDescriptionVerifiedMHash/s /share (if applicable)PPS (if applicable)Days between payments to dividentsLast payment to dividents (BTC)PricePrice / (Mhash/s)Market capitalization (disabled for now)Payments to even out cost of shareDays to even out cost of shareLinkProblems?If you find symbols missing or wrong data, post them in this thread and I will fix it. Sure I'll make then a blog page or blog post about it with the ad on it and paste than instead.Don't worry THAT much about that. I am fine with my solution for the time being. I would have used the <script> version of the ad but IIRC there was some problem embedding external scripts that call document.write into extension popups. Is it possible to add my Chrome extension to the list of sites? The ads appear on the little popup that appears when you click on the extension button but the popup doesn't have a URL to put into the "new site" page.You can see the screenshots here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fblekdojabihjdhndhmloalbcnnejddl to see where the ad appears.BTW I have limited the height of the ad so that image ads are not that intrusive but I believe this is no problem as the worst that can happen is that image ads are clicked less often and thus pay me less and thus appear less often. Did anyone tell Mt Gox about this?  Film2240 what kind of verification are you talking about exactly? I was talking about free full verification but if you need just an autoapprove code we can arrange that too.  TL:Did Read   You can now sort pictures by BTC left to be paid (cheapest first). This sorting can be turned on and off from the topbar. Thanks to jesset for the suggestion.Oh if anyone wants free verification just tell me. The guys that won the contest still haven't answered so... Well if it is a scam then why shouldn't you delete it? In any case you are both helping user not to fall in a scam and your ad network to remain clean. But just make sure it's a real scam, don't wanna kick someone legit.(at the same time I realize that in an anonymous ad network users should be smart enough to check always for scams regardless of what the ad network owner does about them, so in theory it would be better if we could let the network run itself but since you are just starting, maybe you should take care of scams yourself)   I'd also like to know this. As I get it:Bootstrap score = average amount paid in bootstrap address per day during the current cycle. Dictates how often you will be shown in that 10% of each affiliate's views. The higher this is, the more new affiliates you will try.Reward score = average amount paid to affiliates per day, during the current billing cycle. Dictates how often you appear in affiliates in the other 90% of the pageviews. We are more interested in the per affiliate reward score since that dictates how often will each affiliate will show your ads.Are you sure you really mean "last cycle" and not the currently running cycle? I suppose you meant "current cycle" For example in my extension I couldn't put a <script> tag to use the new ad format. I also can't put an iframe because it's too large to fit it in there. I am now using the <img> version of the ads because it's the perfect size for text ads but when the ad is an actual image it's again to large and I have to shrink it using CSS (max-height) to make it fit in the extension's popup. So it would be better if I could block image ads but use the <img> version. Anyway. I'm not asking that you do this since it is, perhaps, a problem that only I have to face while making Chrome extensions. I'll try a few more things first. I might be able to use the <script> version somehow. :-|I haven't made extensions for Firefox and I have no idea how different they are. I suppose they ain't that different... I'll read more about his idea although I have trouble finding a way to measure how much you "own" to each producer. I'll think about it. :-) Done. I added more currencies and there is an option page which lets you deselect unneeded currencies, pick the currency that will be displayed in the ticker and also customize the URL of the graph. :-D I've also refactored the code and it's trivial to add more currencies. I'll probably let users pick their own currencies by code in a later version. We'll see... I'll put an option page. It will allow you to change the graph as you said as well as deactivate currencies you don't need.
Thanks GoWest!I also did just remove the Mt Gox permissions because a redditor was scared away from it and I now mirror the Mt Gox ticker myself on bittit. What security questions?It's secure as long as affiliates don't loose their edit URL. The edit url isn't stored in the DB so there should be no way for someone to find it. But yes, it created a hackable point in the system while right now it has practically no hackable points.MAYBE targeting based on browser language would be better? Not sure but I use a VPS and I am bored of seeing ads about girls in Amsterdam...It's more important to let affiliates edit excluded tags.Also allow affiliates to block image ads. That would be really useful and it is offered by most ad networks. (and I miss this feature)Hahaha I was looking at the database yesterday to do that thing manually. I don't think most people need it though but it would be useful. :-)I don't think you have to do anything.I wish I could help you make these stuff but I've already got too much in my mind these days. :-|I hope you find some investor. Maybe you should think about putting anonymous ads on GLBSE? (https://glbse.com/)BTW I used your ads in a Chrome extension I made: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fblekdojabihjdhndhmloalbcnnejddlThis couldn't be done with Google Adsense for example. :-D You can't put Adsense in webpages that have no public URL and I had to put it a popup window. I've made a Chrome extension that combines a price ticker for any currency combination (BTC/USD, BTC/EUR, LTC/BTC, EUR/USD etc), a price graph, desktop notifications (with option sound effects) for when the price exceeds user specified limits and most importantly a currency converter for the following currencies:BTC Bitcoin averageBTC Bitcoin averageGOX Bitcoin Mt.GoxBTS Bitcoin BitstampBCE Bitcoin BTC-ECBS Bitcoin Coinbase      LTC Litecoin      NMC Namecoin   PPC PPCoin   IXC Ixcoin   TRC TerracoinDVC DevcoinXRP Ripples   MNC MinCoin   SLL Linden dollar (Second Life)USD USA dollar      EUR Euro      RUB Russian ruble      CAD Canadian dollar      GBP Pound sterling      AUD Australian dollar      PLN Polish zloty      UAH Ukrainian hryvnia      CNY Chinese Renminbi      SEK Swedish krona      CZK Czech koruna      BRL Brazilian real      CHF Swiss franc      NOK Norwegian krone      ARS Argentine peso      DKK Danish krone      RON Romanian leu      ILS Israeli new shekel      BGN Bulgarian lev      NZD New Zealand dollar      JPY Japanese yen      MXN Mexican peso      INR Indian rupee      HKD Hong Kong dollar   HUF Hungarian Forint   XAG Silver troy ounce      XAU Gold troy ounce      XPT Platinum troy ounce      XPD Paladium troy ounce      GAG Silver gram      GAU Gold gram (also Pecunix)      GPT Platinum gram      GPD Paladium gramDon't forget to go to the options page, either click the "tools" icon on the top left corner of the converter, or tight click on Biticker's icon and then click Options.Download from Chrome Web Storereddit postI hope you people like it. :-) And if you want me to add more currencies post here or contact me. If you are going to do this you should consider some things:1. Categories might increase the complexity. Keep then optional. For example let affiliates choose what they do NOT want to see. For example I know that my users are likely not interested in ads related to medicine.2. You should probably make a system to edit ads and affiliates to compensate for new ad categories. If a new category is created I might need to exclude it from my affiliate. Maybe you should give an "edit URL" with some sort of random code in the GET parameters. Store the has of that code in the database and when I, or someone else, visit my affiliate link it should check whether the hash of the code in the URL matches with the one in the database, and if it does it should give me options to edit the ad. (just make sure you salt-hash it or the whole thing could be broken with a rainbow table if the codes are short) 1. It's still new so until it balances out with the other ad services it might need some time.2. Adsense sucks ballz... They've closed an account which violated no rule at all just because someone or some people (nobody knows who) was/were causing "suspicious clicks" as Google's described them. And instead of just not paying for those click which the owner of the site had no way to control AT ALL, they shut down the account, no questions asked. Well they gave the owner the right to appeal but they only repeated "suspicius clicks" in their answer and kept the account terminated. So good luck reaching the payout when you site is used by a ten thousand users. One asshole is probably enough to get your account terminated.3. Wait 30 days. Some people might by waiting for the end of the 30 day payout period to pay their affiliates. You might get some more then. Version 9 broke at some point because of updates in the sites I used to take the exchange rates. I switches to new urls that should last longer and it should also be MUCH faster when updating prices. So v10 is out and can finally use my converter again... This makes no sense.What is the problem if botnets do the mining? Honest miners are those that care about mining legitimate blocks and has nothing to do with where they get their power from and at what price (even if they steal energy for free to mine). Also the final arguments can be said about any currency. If I am a criminal I could steal peoples dollars and sell them on the market to create volatility. I don't see the point here... Excellent! I'm already using it on bittit and blended it into the site theme. I'll start using it in my other websites too. :-) Could we have ads served via a script? I don't really fancy the frames and the blog image ad is always white and too wide. Could you serve script so that we can include ads like this:Code:<a href='http://anonymousads.com/userbar/58/click'><script src='http://anonymousads.com/userbar/58/script'></script></a>All the script must do is a document.write if I am not mistaken.That would allow us to make the ad text wrap or change it's style.I don't know what this would do with image ads though. I think that best solution (for us) would be for the script to take some parameters like this:Code:<a href='http://anonymousads.com/userbar/58/click'><script src='http://anonymousads.com/userbar/58/script/200/100'></script></a>should return either text or an image ad that fits within a 200x100 pixel box.That way we can request ads based on how space we've got available. ;-)I've also got two questions.What happens if I put two different affiliate ads in one page?What happens if I put the same affiliate ad two times in a page? I've read it but I didn't see what happens to the bootstrap money anywhere. :-) Maybe you should write that somewhere there explicitly to avoid confusion.I see. I'll drop a few bitcents every now and then on the bittit ad.That's perfect. It means that I can even pay manually if the volume is low enough. Just perfect. :-)Thanks for the answers!BTW it could be usefull to show the current average and maximum bootstrap score in the stats page to let us get an idea of how often we are going to appear in bootstrap ads. ;-)Also in the stats page you say: CPI = 0.09983719 btc per thousand impressionsDon't you mean CPM = 0.09983719? More questions: 1. What happens to the bootstrap money and when? Are they automatically distributed based on something (and what is that?), or do I still control who will get them?2. If I want to pay based on products sold for example, how do I do it? If I pay directly to the partner addresses I see in the CSVs, how is the affiliate (or your system) going to know who paid that affiliate? If I pay via btcrelay, how will the system know which ad is paying that btcrelay paylist? I suppose they have to know somehow who is paying or else how will theyExcuse me if you have answered these things before but right when I grasped the model, I got confused by the technical details. :-D Nice. :-) I don't think that two days max to put something on sale is a lot of time to wait. In any case you did contact me about changing the bitcoin address in one of your pictures before but I am asking because you said: Also there is an auto upload feature but I can only give it to verified uploaders. If you needed it so much I could give an auto upload code for the SFW section though even without being fully verified as long as you've uploaded a few pictures first.What they don't understand though is that copyrights will be increasignly harder to enforce (which is the why bittit would work better as sales model in anonymous markets like inside Tor for example)Two days. And it's pipelined. Also in most cases pics get approved in less than 24 hours.What bug did you see? You can either contact me or report it somewhere and I'll fix it.You can sell photos anonymously without a slow account creation process with email confirmations etc. There are people selling photos over Tor on Bittit, ask them to make an account and see if they would... Also you don't really need to keep track of your pictures on the site since you have a different address to receive money for each one of them. So just fire up your wallet app and monitor them from there. What I can do though is to give the picture link from the beginning, before the picture gets approved, so that you can bookmark it then. Another way would be to use the same album ID for all your pictures so that you can group them together and see them all in one place. As for editing its not that easy. First of all editing the price is unfair unless you want to lower it (which I can do for you whenever you want). Chaging the comment could be the easiest to make but I can still do it for you for less hassle than it would take to make an administration page for pictures. Changing the address for the picture is the trickest part but I have already done it for some pictures (I think at least one was your too) if the uploader asks for it. Exactly. It depends on blockexplorer. :-(I can't tell either who got the coin. Let hope he/she posts here. Next time why not put a discussion thread link in the comments too. It could drive people over here. ;-) Thanks for the explanation arsenische!One more question: Why do you multiply by $maxBootstrapScore. Does it change the ordering? Closed with no winner. But I put some anonymous ads on it and I'm pretty happy with them. :-) Have you contacted me somehow and I didn't answer? I can't remember. I decided to do a little contest on bittit. Whoever uploads the nicest photo (or any picture) in the next 2 days* will win a free full verification (which normally costs 5 euros).Rules:1. All bittit rules and ToS apply: notably the photo must be unpublished and you must own the copyright. 2. NSFW photos are not allowed in the contest (although they are allowed on bittit) 3. When I say the nicest photo, I mean the nicest in my opinion (although I'll probably ask a few friends first). Nice doesn't mean that it must frame something beautiful. A photo of a beggar could be nice although it displays something sad, etc... 4. To get fully verified I will send you two upload codes by registered mail. That means I have to know your real name and address. If you are not fine with that then don't take part in the contest (but you are free to upload you pictures of course). 5. Don't forget to put you email in the corresponding field while uploading or I won't be able to contact you. If you don't want to put an email then just put something like "reddit: username" or "bitcointalk: username" and I'll contact you there. 6. You can upload as many as you want.That's all. Start uploading!*lets say it ends at Sunday 17 Feb 12:00GMT.PS: blockexplorer is down so bittit might have problems too showing some pictures or uploading files. Bittit owner here. Just confirming that he is telling the truth. There has been 1 BTC in one of the wallets since the first day. He never moved it to another wallet and its still there right now. I'm checking the wallet every now and then and I will remove the pics when its gone. Or if that's not fine with SgtSpike I can put another description that it has been found.For reference these are the three wallets: http://bittit.info/index.php?uploader=2dde17cf241a49db3339ff3c97e1c69bBTW Sgt next time you might want to put your email in there. I stumbled across the post by accident. ;-)Oh and there are some problems with blockexplorer today so bittit might be slow or inoperable... Hello again and thanks for the prev explanation. I am using the official bitcoin client though so what affected me is probably a bug(?)Can you describe the ad selection algorithm exactly? As I understand it now it goes like this:1. A dice drop decides whether it will display a bootstrapping ad or not. 10% to be a bootstraping ad (which is ANY ad that still has unspent bootstrap money, right?).2. It evaluates each ad by the money it has given you in the last month (or in the last accounting period which is different for each ad?) divided by the impressions it had.3. It shows the ad with the most profitable evaluation. Maybe it would make more sense to pick a random ad weighted by the value calculated in step 2 instead of just the best one?
Hi! I see some inconsistency between my wallet and the affiliate page.

Yet the sum of bitcoins reported match the one I see... *bump* (I hope there is no problem bumping a 10 day long auction every one or two days) *bump* after one day. Advertise on www.filosofiki.eu.

I don't know if his is the place to ask but it's kinda about bittit so I'll ask.It looks like the ad place in bittit is really underpaid. I rarely get more than one ad bid so I practically don't get paid for the ad in it. I would prefer not to set up a minimum fee and instead rely on people to decide the price for the ad. But why isn't that happening?I got the same problem with the ad on my blog. Before some time I had an ad that paid really well but now the price I get is 1BTC/55000 views.Any ideas why this is happening? I will think about how something like that can implemented without interfering with the main purpose of the site which is to sell pictures on the public domain. BTW the first uses I thought about bittit was /r/gonewild pictures and webcomics. :-DIt makes a lot of sense for webcomics. And I even provide hotlinks to the images so it's trivial for someone to use them in his blog or comic site. And then place the bitcoin address below. This could include paying someone people already know they want to see more. For example make exclusive contracts with porn stars with a lot of fans, and then make this the only way these select exclusive pics could ever be seen.[/quote]I don't really want to force good quality or trusted only pictures TBH. I'd prefer to keep the market open for everyone. But the idea of bringing content from famous people themselves is very good. There is already a way to get validated so perhaps I could offer more promotion to validated users by putting up a list of their albums in the front page. I will that ASAP and then try to find someone to list their photos.Do you mean that the buy out option would be a higher price than the normal price, or lower? Or whatever the seller wants?I like the buyout idea and my only objection is that it goes beyond the aims of bittit which is to provide a market that needs no copyright laws to work. Putting a buyout option needs laws in order to have a meaning. But that's not a serious objection so I will consider adding something like that.Another problem with buyout is that some people might have chipped in already and now they will not be able to get any more of the picture. It might scare some people off chipping in because they might anytime loose the chance to actually get the picture on the public domain. So why would they chip in to get a low res version of the picture and then someone else prohibits them from getting anything better than that? I can see many annoying scenarios with that and I'll have to think of a way to counter them first. Else I'd be just making yet another photo selling site.   If someone uploads a copyrighted picture then DMCA will probably give me an early warning and not a direct lawsuit. I can't check about Facebook pictures probably but I think the combination of Google and Tineye rules out most of the private subscription pix as they are usually riped and spread all over the internet. BTW I forgot the most important one: I require validation from someone that uploads nudes or porn. It's not 100% foolproof but it's the best I can do. (more info about validation can be found in the help pages of bittit or you may ask and I'll give the details here).I'm mostly using Chrome and Firefox and they both seem to have no problems. Every now and then I try the site with IE9 and last time I checked I saw some minor problems, like bitcoin addresses running one or two characters our of the picture boxes. Usually fixing things for every version of IE takes more time than making the site in the first place so I put my efforts into being standards compliant, then making the site usable in IE and then I spend the rest of my time making something new for the site instead of polishing it for every version of IE. It just takes to much time to be worth it. Nevertheless if you tell me which OS and browser you used when you saw those problems I might be able to fix them. Also which pictures exhibit them should help too. :-)I like simple designs too but I think the site is already way below the average visual complexity of all websites. The background is very simple and it's practically the only picture in the site, the shadows don't look like clutter to most people (actually I really fancy them) but I agree that the horizontal lines may go. I probably put them there to line up the left with the right column and to make it easier to see what is opposite of what. I'll remove them tomorrow and see how it is. Now is by "simplicity" you mean "craig-list-simplicity" then I don't think I like it. Unless you only meant I should remove the white boxes around the links.Why not? Also what resolution is your screen? I'm thinking about grouping some of the legal stuff of the topbar into one but I don't know if the laws in the USA require those links to be individually visible.I will try remove what I can from the layout. :-) I just made a few changes, the most important of which is that ALL kinds of files can be sold now.It goes like this:1. You upload, for example, your unpublished book. You set the starting size at 100 bytes. And the price to 20BTC.2. The first 100 bytes of your book are now on the public domain for free.3. People pay to read more. Bytes are linearly "revealed" while payments approach 20BTC.4. Your book is fully published when you have gotten 20BTC.The same system will probably work with mp3 files, most video files, tar files and any other file that makes sense to have the first X% of its data.It's still BETA but you may give it a try. It's the second tab in the upload page. Max upload size is 60MB and as always you have to put original content (although this time it will be harder for me to check whether it's original or not).Enjoy!PS: I've written something about the reasons why I made bittit on my blog: http://www.inshame.com/2011/12/on-intellectual-property-also.html (I believe it's fine to give the link here)PS2: I'll go to sleep now so whatever you upload will be approved in about 8 hours... ;-) Version 6 is out and supports the new GUI which broke the old version. R2R version is not ready yet. I will update the post when I make it.   I could work although some users could could grief that system by reporting photos as stolen and delay payments.But in any case I don't wan't to down that path. Currently payments go directly to the uploader. I don't want to change that as it would require me getting a much better VPS and also I just like the system as it is, without me getting between the transacting parties.I'm leaning towards the 3rd solution. Sending PINs over registered mail. It's not the fastest way but I think it's pretty secure and professional photographers or graphic designers wouldn't have a problem with it, if they want to increase their trustworthiness. Also I really need some feedback on something. I am thinking of adding validated acocunts so that people will know who to sue if the pictures aren't original. I am thinking of ways that one could validate his/her account. Validated accounts will be able to upload pictures that are marked as such (red border and a note probably). Currently I am thinking of these ways to validate:1. One time minimal payment (like 0.5$) via Paypal. I don't like this because it involves paypal which can go **** *******.2. The user could send me a registered mail to prove his identity but I just got informed that you can send registered mail without showing any ID so it provides zero authentication.3. I could send a PIN with registered mail to someone (or even not registered?). That would prove that this is his/her address and name. To cover the costs I could ask for a few bitcents in advance.4. I could send a PIN with SMS. This would only work in the retarded countries where you need ID to buy even a prepaid phone (like here in Greece). Again I could ask for a few bitcents in advance.5. GPG signatures. It could work if we had a serious web of trust.Any ideas? I'd really love to do this and be competitive to other stock photo marketplaces.I was looking at istockphoto's terms. If I am not mistaken the only thing you have to do is this:This can be cheated with some simple photoshopping I suppose but I don't know if someone would be able to receive money with a fake address. The bad thing is that with Bitcoins I can't do the same. One can receive money and photoshop his ID. bittit is now in onionland too: http://etedojmrkv7ycxn4.onionYou obviously need to access this via Tor. (https://www.torproject.org/) Visitors pay to increase the resolution for everyone.So if you upload a photo and set the price to 5BTC, it will be shown at the maximum resolution when the total amount of BTC paid to the picture's address reaches 5BTC.For example you upload a picture that is 2000x1000 pixels. You set the price to 5BTC and the initial resolution to 100 (which is the default).Initially the picture's resolution will be 200x100 (0BTC paid)For 2.5BTC paid the resolution will be 1100x550 (that is the smallest size will be halfway between 100 and 1000 just like 2.5BTC is halfway to 1BTC).For 5BTC the resolution will reach 2000x1000.Additionally the quality of the served JPG file will increase. In the end the quality setting will be 100% which is almost lossless. RSS is available now and it's connected to our twitter account too. We now have a twitter account where we will post new photos that we find interesting: bittit_btcIf it becomes overwhelming I will automate it. "We heard you like money so we put..." You can take orders for free directly and then sell your photos on bittit.info too if that suits you. No fees at all and it's made for the purpose of selling pictures. The image will be visible in low res and users will pay to increase its resolution up to the maximum. You decide the price for the maximum resolution beforehand. Just make sure that you put the right price. For example if your picture at 1/5th of its resolution is still useful then you might consider putting a higher price for the max resolution. Yeah blockexplorer. My own client would definitely be more efficient but my VPS can't handle it... :-/ I have about 175MB left to spare and that isn't enough for bitcoin unfortunately... Deslok had a nice idea that could bring the time down to 3 minutes +1 block time if it works. I could check every 3 minutes the block count and only scan for new payments when it changes. But AFAIK the block count updates faster than the addressreceived API stuff. So checking the addresses right after tha block count changed could yeild no results in some cases. Another idea is to examine every single block and add up the received bitcoins to known addresses. That would scale perfectly even if the site get's really big, its completelly non-abusive for blockexplorer but needs a good coding to make sure I don't miss any payments... In fact the handling for blockchain merges could be a bit tricky... Quite tricky actually... We'll see. First thing will be to let the uploader choose how many blocks he wants to wait for.No need to read this if you are not interested in our quarrel:I don't get offended but I found your comments ignorant and accusing. You said that I sale pictures on behalf of others while I don't. You suggested I should make the ToS less protective for me and at the same time open holes for doublespending. That would make me open to getting sued in case someone doublespends, is that your opinion? Your first message ("BTW you can test your setup. How about that? Stitch your own big picture and set your limits accordingly instead of letting people find out their picture ends up public domain without getting any BTC.") sounded pretty sarcastic to me, like I was your employee and I had to test everything so that you are happy with it. You can suggest whatever you want, but don't be sarcastic to me if you expect me to stay calm. And I am not a pro. I made a site that I liked and I really don't care if I don't make money from it although I think it's worth it.As for the spam problem. I scan pictures with tineye and google. That helps me to rule out lots of pictures. If you manage to find unindexed pictures that don't have a website logo and upload them then the DMCA will protect me AFAIK. I host pictures that users upload so if one infringes their copyrights they can report it using the procedure described by DMCA laws and not sue me. And specifically for the nsfw section most pictures would require validation before getting approved (as described in the help section). If I have problems with Tor, I will block it. I DO NOT receive payments on behalf of anyone. The payments go directly to the seller. I just monitor the bitcoin network to see when the payment happens. And the delays are mostly because of the bitcoin network and I can do nothing to make it faster so get over it and read the help and ToS or don't use it. And no, I won't accept by default transactions before they are included in a valid block because no matter what my ToS says I don't want someone to loose let's say 20BTC in a double spend attack. The ToS is there to protect my ass and not to allow me to mess up with my users. I might make it a parameter though for the seller to choose the protection level he wants but still there will be a 0-10 minutes delay before I check the address on bitcoinexplorer.I will add "and wait 30 minutes" to the instructions on the front page.
If it didn't work it wouldn't show a picture at all. But even if it just couldn't resize it and instead displayed it at full size, I would notice that during the approval phase... I will do some testing when I can though. I've got lots of things to test and add to it and no time to do them. Plus the other guy that wrote some of the code has got even less free time (it's the exam period).It says in the help that it will take up to 30 minutes. If it took longer than that then there is probably a bug.If it took less than 30 minutes then how do you define "acceptable"? I could wait for 6 blocks (since that is what is generally considered safe) which is more than an hour, and you think 30 min are unacceptable for you to wait to get a picture?The cron job that checks bitcoinexplorer runs every ten minutes. Anything faster than that sounds a little abusing to me and I don't have the option to run my own bitcoin explorer.Also why are you aggressive? It's a free to use service if you haven't noticed so if it makes you that angry just don't use it or politely ask me to fix it and be patient.[EDIT] It can handle pictures up to 5000 x 5000. (at least) Wow that is HUGE! I will increase the max upload size. Try again in 30 minutes form now. BTW the castle photo is amazing...[EDIT] I changed my php.ini. I hope I changed the correct one cause I had like 4 of them... one for cgi one for cli etc... If it still errors drop me a pm or an email (email is on the site). BTW I don't know if the resizer can handle that big pictures. We'll see... Well you ain't reading it the first time so you are taken back to the SFW section. I think it will be obvious that you don't see the NSFW because of the choices you made in the last 3 seconds so you'll get it right the second time when you will have to read what the dialog says.I might put a whole page asking the user for confirmation but I ain't doing that now. :-) (also the confirmation box is much faster) New stuff:1. Configurable initial resolution2. Made a logo, sort of.3. "Premium" codes for automatic approval are available. I don't understand. What dialog box? I thought you meant the javascript confirmation box for the NSFW section. And here is a subreddit for bug reports, suggestions etc... bittit.reddit.com Just added direct links to photos, hotlinks, link to uploader pages.To create an uploader page just use the same uploader ID (which should not be forgotten or shared with other people) during the upload process. This will put a link under each of you photos that will take visitors to see all your photos (all photos that use the same uploader ID that is...). You can use this to create albums or whatever. Why not? I use MSE too and I haven't got any alarm from my site. Perhaps it was form adf.ly who knows. There are no other ad networks used on the page. I didn't know there were serious js exploits. MaxSan I had some serious problems with my web hosting company today and on top of that my internet connection broke for many hours leaving the site with a crappy piece of code that made all pictures invisble... :-) I hope I fixed everything now. Maybe you tryied to use the site while it was slower than a turtle or maybe you tried to upload the picture while I did some change in the code. Using chrome there is an upload progress i nthe status text but I don't know yet how to make an upload progress bar. Maybe I'll check that out sometime but I got lots of things waiting to be implemented. :-D After all, when the server is working properly even with my crappy connection I need less than a minute to upload a 5MP picture. Well I thought that the javascript popup when you first enter was enough to warn you about that. :-)Oh and I did some major changes to the site. NSFW is seperated now and only original content can be uploaded.And I don't see anything in my blog. I scanned it with virustotal and it comes up clean. How did you get that warning BitcoinPorn?PS: Also to upload NSFW pictures you have to verify yourself with a procedure similar to /r/gonewild. Sorry for the fuss... I just made this site with a friend. You can upload an original picture and set a price for it. Then the picture will be shown at the front page of the site in a low resolution and users will have to pay to increase the resolution. It seemed like a nice sale model to me so here it is: bittit.info.BTW I hesitate to add this to the wiki because I don't know which section it falls under. I realize that the best users for a site like this would be the people over /r/gonewild and I intend to allow such usage (that's why I ask for age confirmation to first-time visitors). If someone could tell me which is the proper place for it I'd be happy. :-) 1. How often do you go to another mac with your flash drive, needing to run Bitcoin? Generally I don't think portable apps have any point on platforms other than windows.2. It's written in AutoIt3, so it can't be used naivelly on Mac or Linux.3. I don't have any Apple product and neither do I intent to buy one  so I can't even test it.I suppose that a bash script wrapper for Linux could work on mac too but we are talking about making it from scratch in another language which I also dislike (Bash scripts)... The code is open though so if someone wants to convert it somehow. I know that for Linux a similar language to AutoIt3 is AutoHotkey which works both on Linux and Windows, don't know about Mac though. When the Bitcoin client could mine for Bitcoins someone asked for this feature so that he could run it on a computer and have all mined coins sent to his main wallet. Now I suppose it's only useful as a redirect.You are right about the link. I removed paywithatweet for now. There is also this portable wrapper which I made: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=944 Some minor changes in version 5. Download links remain the same.; 5: No longer lowers the priority of the Bitcoin process.;    The blockchain feature needs Bitcoin v0.4 to work.I updated the R2R version too but it will take quite some time to upload. This blockchain is HUGE!!!PS: Someone made this too: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=18870.0 Version 9 supports the new Mt Gox ticker format so it should now be able to update the BTC/USD rate. Haha really? In any case I released version 7.Changelog:Andrzej added PLN. Thanks for that Andrzej. :-)Stores the last update time in the INI so that exiting and running the program soon won't cause an update. Hey thank you! If you need anything added to the program just say it...   The first time you run the wrapper it will guide you through a setup process. I think that the final step allows you to define extra parameters to be passed to bitcoin.exe. I don't know if what you try to do can be done via extra parameters though.Also there might be problems since I use a specific configuration file so that the wrapper can communicate with the client.If you still have problems tell me and I'll take a better look trying to find a solution. Glad you liked it. :-) BTW thanks to whoever sent some coins!  
Version 6 is out.*Added RUB and CAD.*Fixed the LD label link.*No more beeps. Instead it will show a persistent message that something went wrong.I didn't change the JSON thing yet...   I was a bit bored.   OK Bitlex I'll use the json URL instead. It should be a little faster after all. Oh and I will change the label too... I thought I had. I'll post the new version before Monday. I will add it in the next version along with Canadian $. :-) But I will use Google for the $/RUB rate since ALL conversions in BTConvert go through US$.   I don't know if anyone else has noticed this but it often fails to update the BTC/$ rate. If you click refresh though it will update it normally.I guess it's Mt. Gox that delays to respond and some timeout expires. Anybody having this problem too? Just fixed another bug where some GPG files where left in a parental directory. mpkomara I will do it today after I finish work. I will put something sensible for each currency. Thank you very much for the tip. :-)EDIT: I made the two requested changes. Download it using the same download link. Here is the changelog so far:v1 Initial version.v2 Added AUD.   Added refresh button.v3 Some timers changed.   Added link to bitcoin.org when someone clicks on his label.v4 Users that click refresh too often are asked if they are sure.   Added Linden dollar and Pecunix.   All labels are links to related pages.v5 Changed Lindel dollar source.   Fixed a bug with manual refresh warning.   Limited the decimal digits to something sensible. Drifter that would happen if you couldn't connect to Google or if Google was sending back unrecognized data. I looks like the only rates that weren't updated was the ones that Google is queried for. Are you using any proxies with Internet Explorer?BitLex you mean I should change where the converter get's it's data or just just change the source in the about dialog? I suppose you meant the former. I will do it in the next version. :-) I've added some more currencies: Pecunix and Linden dollars. I really don't care about extremelly fast transactions. It would be enough for me if Bitcoin didn't even show unconfirmed transactions and didn't even try to spend them before they get confirmed. FFS just wait 10minutes for a block to appear confirming them.   They will get confirmed when someone that doesn't require fees include them in his/her block.There is no invalid chain just because someone didn't want to pay the fee. It will just take longer for them to get included in a block and until then they can be double spend if someone hasn't heard about them. BTW if nodes don't propagate transactions just because they don't like them it will be dangerous since it will be easier for someone to double spend bitcoins.You can also send the same 1BTC back and forth between two clients, using different addresses every time. If you do it fast enough you will probably be able to fill up the block that everyone is trying to generate and therefore make the network really slow and lower the chances for legitimate transactions to get into blocks... Also if you do it reeeealllly fast you could saturate the network for a long time, even after you exit the network. You will just leave the rest trying to fit hundreds of thousands of transactions into blocks... I don't know if there is any protection in the protocol from this kind of attacks... If not, they are quite easy to be done. We really need fixed transaction fees with the option to change your preferences on what is the fixed price you accept and what fee to include in your own transactions. Huh? Clients don't propagate what they consider invalid? I thought that they just didn't include it in their blocks... You could edit your client to make it include into blocks any transactions without looking at the fee. And then wait a month or so until you make a block which will include your transactions... Or wait until someone else with a custom client includes your transactions in his block. I don't think one existed so here it is!BTConvert. A portable currency converter for BTC, USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, Linden$, Pecunix, RUB, CAD and PLN. It takes the exchange rates from the internet every 30 minutes. Nothing fancy, it just works. I think...AutoIt3 sources are included. If you don't need them just keep the executable.Suggestions, tips etc are welcome as always.  Also if anybody has missed it I've made a portable wrapper for Bitcoin: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=944.0Changes so far:v1 Initial version.v2 Added AUD.   Added refresh button.v3 Some timers changed.   Added link to bitcoin.org when someone clicks on his label.v4 Users that click refresh too often are asked if they are sure.   Added Linden dollar and Pecunix.   All labels are links to related pages.v5 Changed Lindel dollar source.   Fixed a bug with manual refresh warning.   Limited the decimal digits to something sensible.v6 Added RUB and CAD.   Fixed the LD label link.   No more beeps. Instead it will show a persistent message that something went wrong.v7 Andrzej added PLN. Thanks for that Andrzej. :-)   Stores the last update time in the INI so that exiting and running the program soon won't cause an update.v8 Docks in tray.   No longer asks if you refresh the rates very often.v9 Support for the new Mt Gox ticker data.v10 Fixed last version because it broke.   Data for most currencies is taken from: http://openexchangerates.org/latest.json   Changed BTC decimals to 4. (0.0001 Definitely useful. An archive would be amazing. Do it!      Doh! I found a stupid bug that appeared when you run it with a different working directory than the one where it existed. It would say that it cannot decrypt your wallet (scary) but you could anyway decrypt it with GPG directly.  I fixed it and I am uploading the new versions (it'll take 15min) Version 3 is out. :-) I hope it works, I hope you like it. :-)A bug I have no idea how to fix is that if you select the encrypted wallet and you shutdown the system, it will not be encrypted, it won't cause any trouble, it just won't be encrypted that time.I updated the initial post. Check it for download links and features... It can be done but why would that be a useful feature for a portable wrapper?   I could make it another script though. Install bitcoin somewhere and then run this script.You can already do this I think with a scheduled task and the bitcoind.exe. (you'll have to enable the JSON API though) Hello! I have the next version ready and I am testing it now. Here is the current changelog:1. Bincoin is now set to idle priority after ten seconds for a faster startup (it was 0 seconds after it's window appeared)2. StartupTime is now the average of it's previous value and the new startup time. (90-10 ratio)3. UPnP support. (using UPnPPW, a closed source  command line UPnP port forwarder)4. Encryption support using GPG. The wallet get encrypted between runs of BitcoinPortable5. Compression handled by GPG when the wallet is encrypted.Any more ideas? Some kind of autoupdate or blockchain download? Thank you very much! :-DAaah the ironkey. I always wanted one of these. How does it ask for the decryption keys when you plug it? I suppose that it is reconized as a read only medium containing the unlocking software and then after it autoruns and you type the pass, it switches to a regular USB flash drive. Am I right? No worries, a bug report or a suggestion is better than a tip. ;-)Which version did you try?
