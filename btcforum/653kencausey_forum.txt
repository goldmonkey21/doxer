I think it is worth pointing out that the actual volume of the odd trades on 9/14 was miniscule.  The total cost in USD was $0.022987; that's right, just over 2 cents.  Details:{"date":1284488277,"price":0.07,"amount":0.086}{"date":1284489530,"price":0.1,"amount":0.01}{"date":1284490532,"price":0.106,"amount":0.047}{"date":1284490616,"price":0.11,"amount":0.036}{"date":1284491010,"price":0.12,"amount":0.025}{"date":1284491740,"price":0.175,"amount":0.023}price is the USD/BTC conversion rate, amount is the number of BTC traded. Oh yes, sorry, my mistake, prices and times but no volumes. I assume you  mean that rather than the volume over the last 24 hours, you would like the volume since, for example, midnight in some timezone.  But what timezone?  MtGox is a 24/7, theoretically worldwide market.  There is no 'close of market' as is customary from historical exchanges.  On the 'All Time' chart you get the volume and open/close/high/low figures broken up into consistent 24 hour periods.http://www.mtgox.com/code/getHistory.phpthat's last 48 hours I believe. Rather than changing the counting scheme why not simply refer to the latest block rather than the count of blocks.  74741 blocksversus  Latest block: 74740eliminating the need to change the counting scheme and requiring many to adjust their thinking. I added the addnode options and info about the 'stuck at 74638 blocks' issue at http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=823.msg9595#msg9595 Updated and combined instructions:1.  Stop generating immediately, close your current client if you have not updated to 0.3.10.2.  Download 0.3.10:http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.10-win32-setup.exehttp://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.10-win32.ziphttp://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.10-linux.tar.gzSHA1 16645ec5fcdb35bc54bc7195309a1a81105242bb bitcoin-0.3.10-win32-setup.exeSHA1 4f35ad7711a38fe8c880c6c9beab430824c426d3 bitcoin-0.3.10-win32.zipSHA1 e3fda1ddb31b0d5c35156cacd80dee6ea6ae6423 bitcoin-0.3.10-linux.tar.gz3. (optional)  Download a previously known good blockchain:http://knightmb.dyndns.org/files/bitcoin/blocks/http://rapidshare.com/files/413168038/BitcoinBlocks.torrentand replace your blk0001.dat and blkindex.dat files with those from the relevant download for your platform.3b.  If you don't download, delete or move the blk0001.dat and blkindex.dat files.4.  Start 0.3.10 and watch it catch up to block 74637 and beyond and help restart things.Edit:Edit 2: Add more explanation4b.  Currently the network has a combination of good and bad nodes (those running versions older than 0.3.10).  If you only connect to nodes running old versions, you will be stuck at 74638 blocks.  You can fix this by running the client with the options "-addnode=75.158.131.108 -addnode=99.27.237.13 -addnode=76.235.234.64 -addnode=74.137.15.169 -addnode=68.68.99.14".  This specifically connects you to a number of 'known good' nodes and ensures that you receive transactions generated within the network of updated clients.  As the number of out of date clients in the network decreases, this will become unnecessary.  If you want more nodes or just different ones, you can find a larger list at http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?do=show&id=74638_nodes . I had some confusion on this myself and got clarification in #bitcoin-dev:The bad block was number 74638, the last good one was 74637.  The numbers start at 0, so when your client shows there are 74638 blocks then that means you have up to block number 74637, the last good one. I just used your old file knightmb and on a rather old system it didn't take me very long to catch up, so I'm inclined to say "don't bother". 74637 is the last good block Edit: Hmm, I see there is an info file included which might just clue me in.How about explaining to us stupid newbies what we would do with the blockchain once we download it? I'm afraid the community is just too big and distributed now to expect much in the way of voluntary quick action on anything, especially generation which I'm sure many have on automatic and largely unmoderated. Related thread: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=823.0 Original post: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0 I'm self-employed primarily as a custom software developer and consultant.  I would certainly be willing to accept bitcoins in exchange for services.Additionally I am selling comic books and would be willing to sell for bitcoins.  Seehttps://www.atomicavenue.com/atomic/SellerIssues.aspx?S=kencauseyfor a list of available issues.  I add new items every day.  I also have trading cards and some items of original art and other miscellaneous related items.  If you see an item you would like email me and I would be happy to trade at current BTC/USD rates at the time of transaction. The stability is, at least temporarily at an end.Starting in the early hours (US time) mtgox.com began to surge, so far reaching 0.0735 USD/BTC.  Temporary surge?  Probably, but how long will it last and how high will it go?
