Well done! Glad to see you still working on your implementation. Very interesting and promising book.BTW I've submitted the final stealth standard to Peter Todd ready for him to publish. There are some changes, but we'll have to wait for it to be published/reviewed. Here's the doc: https://github.com/genjix/bips/blob/master/bip-stealth.mediawiki I can't believe there's some fucking scumbags here saying it's bad if ISIS use Bitcoin "because it gives Bitcoin a bad image".ISIS is a slaving, murdering, fascist organisation that literally brutally tortures and executes hundreds of people every other week to instil terror, strapping bombs to young children and imprisoning 9 year old girls as sex slaves because they don't follow their specific religious sect. They are brutal fascist psychopaths, and the only problem for you is it could be bad for Bitcoin's image? Shame on you. we're working on the server a lot, see this:https://wiki.unsystem.net/en/index.php/Libbitcoin/Blockchain/htdb_slab_Performancehere are the development repos:https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer (formerly sx)https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-server (formerly Obelisk)sx has basically been rewritten by eric voskuil, and the server will undergo more improvements too (see https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-protocol ) which will allow SPV for wallets with the new protocol. hey so just an update as to what's going on:- Obelisk has been renamed to libbitcoin-server and is undergoing lots of changes.- libbitcoin has a new faster blockchain backend.- SX is renamed to libbitcoin-explorer and has been improved.we're still working on testing & improving the software, but once that's complete, there will be a new release.sorry about all the troubles. I know Peter Todd and interact with him quite a bit. He most certainly is involved in Viacoin a lot. He even quit MasterCoin to work on Viacoin. He sees it as a vehicle to implement his ideas, and Drak is an open collaborator. I've spent time with both of them.see this also:http://blog.viacoin.org/2014/10/01/petertodd-dev-update.html cool I've had big arguments with communists before turning aggressive and loud calling me bourgeois despite my extremely modest lifestyle striving for my ideals. No matter what you say they are hopelessly dogmatic and unwilling to understand why you can't take power to fix things.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issues_in_anarchism#CommunismTheir ideology is rooted in an older period and is an obsolete dogma for our time.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-left_anarchyI sympathise heavily with these viewpoints:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_anarchism#Left-wing_market_anarchismhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeolibertarianismIn the end, we don't have all the answers, simply ideals to strive towards thinking how we should implement them in the here and the now. Unlike any utopic ideology, what separates us is putting what we say into practice and living our ideals as our activism.I've lived around the world, and interacted with many activist communities. I'm friends with people across all the spectrum from academics, politicians, businessmen, anarchists of the south, libertarians of the west, ... and sense a common strand of perception on the world separated often by isolating language or political frameworks. What an American believes and emphasises is very much tied to the local culture, context and history, and differs from a Spanish guy. It's important to look past this with understanding about the issues with a recognition that we are one freedom movement.There are different governance models, different ways of organising, and no one way is objectively better. There are tradeoffs. What we can do is work through markets to provide the things to empower people to self-organise. I fundamentally believe (take it as a dogma or experience ) that free & open markets work best in our favour as we're working against the status quo. It's not simply a matter of what's better but also the inevitability of a changing global landscape that we have to adapt to. I want a world based on merit and empathy (if you're egoist, call it "enlightened self-interest", or leftist call it "mutuality"). I love to support people doing cool things or projects with my own money or have nice people around. My method is about creating the tools or means so we can have 10s of thousands or millions of people working together, supporting each other with a philosophy of "why put your money in the corporations, put your money in your friends". We spend lots of money everyday giving to big corporations, but instead if we could satisfy our needs as free people, we can continue to reinvest in each other. From different perspectives you could call this either socialism or capitalism (depending on your definitions of the word).Here's an article about the CIC in Catalonia. They are using the legal structure of a cooperative to create their own startup government that provides the basic services that people need to live, but better than that of the governments of the state:https://cooperativa.cat/en/integral-revolution/They use the legal structure to create their own internal economy and are ~10,000 different organisations with a food network and different services for people. It's a cool vision.Also our plan is to build our own cities:https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/UnSYSTEM/Opensource_cityA communist town (interesting to understand):https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinaleda,_Spain inBitweTrust what's your community? Sound interesting, I want to visit.I'm not anti ancap ideas, just that I empathise more with market anarchism as a tactic because sometimes the ancap wiki article sounds too fantastical and idealised rather than realistic. especially when it gets into insurance companies and private enforcers which is a big no no for me. I've seen some funky youtube videos where this company A pays that company B blaa blaa - very utopic almost. transhumanism is wishful thinking bordering on utopic fantasies and self-congratulatory masturbation:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHVtUw5wToAa kind of techno fascism with no rooting in the present, nor in human nature but rather some psuedo-scientific future projections.it's the palm reading of techno-philes.bitcoin users suffer it when they talk about self-driving cars and crap like that:http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2j2uia/having_your_own_local_economy_with_bitcoin/this "vision" is not one of freedom through empowerment but of utopic convenience. A lot of people is going to die or be disenfranchised. That's the way it has to be, I'm sorry.Those of us that are organised will thrive however with the rise of ideological movements as the alternative base of political power.Humans act altruistic or selfish depending on biological makeup, upbringing or environment. We possess both qualities- some more than other and altruism is well documented by science. Social darwinism as a social theory is old, outdated and discredited.However to be effective, our proposals must speak both to altruism and enlightened self-interest.As a political activist who rejects utopianism, it's important we think about our action here and now with a mind of where we want to go towards. Preserving individual spirit is the most important goal for breeding liberty. Liberty and equality are not always the same, sometimes opposed.There is just no other way, people are going to die. Our trajectory cannot continue its insanity. Any solution we propose for how people live must be in their enlightened self interest. Call it whatever you will, but our current society is about blind consumption and short term thinking. It's pretty shit and could be much better.I feel like the people arguing here, are mostly arguing over terms than real substantive differences.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issues_in_anarchism#Definitional_concernsFor how socialism could be achieved through markets:http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Practical_Post-Scarcity_Videohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_anarchism#Left-wing_market_anarchismThis left-right thing is nonsense anyway, I don't even believe in it.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-left_anarchyAs an ideal anarcho-capitalism is just as utopic as anarcho-communism. I've never heard a good answer as to who enforces property ownership. It's worth understanding that ownership of land (on which we were all born and belonged to nobody) is a purely western concept. Property is connected to labour- you might own the building, but you cannot own property titles to unused land without an enforcer/mafia. "Socialism is a social and economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy""Libertarianism (Latin: liber, "free") is a political philosophy that upholds liberty as its principal objective. Libertarians seek to maximize autonomy and freedom of choice, emphasizing political freedom, voluntary association and the primacy of individual judgment."Socialism and libertarianism are not necessarily opposites. That's the problem with arguing about these ideological dogmas that place people into separating boxes. Start thinking what the values we want to promote are, and develop a deeper political philosophy. These labels are not addressing the root causes. From Wikipedia article on Anarchism:"As a subtle and anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive."Freedom starts with "I am my own master" but ends before "I am slave to no man". Liberty is the possession of agency, the power to fulfil your own potential. It's important in this modern day and age of mass criminalisation, and of stolen liberties, to understand that the only path to preservation of spirit is through preservation of action.To preserve our human spirit, we must look not to surrogate father figures, or the great grand institutions but instead to each other, directly from one humble person to another. The Darkness becomes our protective cloak for this nascent perspective. sick cool post beliathon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_liberty those books verge on pseudoscience.looking at socialism and libertarianism as exclusionary ideologies is inherent dogmatic, and portrays a shallow political philosophy. it is more fitting to think of the values you wish to promote such as equality, liberty or security. does your concept of liberty include the right to deny freedom to others even through non-violent means? freedom for the pike is death for the minnows. for instance the difference behind the GPL and MIT licenses. does your concept of freedom mean freedom from external constraint, or freedom for the individual to fulfil their potential? big changes coming to libbitcoin, obelisk and sx. stay tuned... I'm enjoying the sheer madness of 4chanI could care less about hollywood celebs great stuff, darkwallet uses that too. you can check its source to compare with your code. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2305863That's really exciting thing to see because governments have had classictrouble fighting tax haven jurisdictions, but recently have been gainingmore success by instead of fighting the jurisdictions, instead givingmore power to banks yet turning them into agents of the state. So thebanks serve the tax authorities and are given more power becausegovernments centralise the financial infrastructure.We have a situation currently where people are taxed both from normaltaxes and inflation. Paper money contributes massively to state power,not only by profits from inflation, but by giving leverage over who canaccumulate wealth.Hence "captialism for the rich, socialism for the poor". Corporationseither stay competitive and evade tax through offshores, or go bust, allwhile servicing state law, regulations and institutional power structures.Now with Bitcoin though everyone can have a super tax-haven with norequirements to report income and no liabilities. We already havedecentralised money laundering. The technology is improving fast andthis will only get much better too. Especially once we have the toolsfor issuing securities to anonymous investors. http://motherboard.vice.com/read/is-the-islamic-state-really-using-bitcoin yes agree. these words are from the snake's mouth trying to sell us an agenda.
Bonjour,Je souhaiterais savoir si le site Darkwallet fonctionne chez-vous en France ?Quel est votre FAI ?https://darkwallet.is/Merci can you explain payment ids? how do users make sense of the data?say a website posts a single address, users send payments to it... at some point the user has to send something to the website so they know which payment is which... why don't they just transmit the decrypted shared secret that only the sender should have? that way the website knows it was them that sent the payment.or if the website sends a nonce to the user so they can make repeating payments then the website can issue the same stealth address but with different prefixes for each user. that makes it highly efficient for the website to receive payments by scanning a single stealth address and separating based on their stealth_prefix into different users. Hi, sx supports stealth. I wrote these commands to aid developers as a debugging tool:http://sx.dyne.org/stealth.htmlfor anonymity I don't want people to differentiate payments sent to me. If it's needed you can already shard payments by grinding the prefix to differentiate. https://wiki.unsystem.net/en/index.php/DarkWallet/Stealth#Comparing_prefixesI prefer a simple proposal that does one thing rather than trying to second guess every possible future use case we're not aware of yet. It's the UNIX philosophy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better one day the training wheels will come off and you'll no longer need to colour the world in one dogma. learn from all. there's no right or wrong way, just different tradeoffs and different values (some better and more human than others). luke radowski is an incredible dude piotr has a point. this was made not because it benefits p2p transfers or small business, but because developers are working for corporations.you know if you're pushing tech like this, and then guiding development proposing to remove the block size limit .etc that's a dangerous thing. we can totally get rid of that and all the limits and have bitcoin owned by a cartel of corporations if you like... at least then transfers will be cheap but it will be the same as the banking cartel we have now.but i get it, bitcoin for you is a nice fun way for consumers to make payments better between their centralised coporate silos legitimised through government legislation. bitcoin for americans.what happens when the liberatory aspects of bitcoin come in conflict with the utility as a payments system? which will you favour at the expense of the other?the features you work to promote, are the aspects of bitcoin that are grown, and don't forget the consensus.mike, i don't even know what you're talking about. you are such a boot licker it's hilarious. thanks for the paper. my view is that nodes should encrypt and sign every connection, and user's should interact with the main bitcoin topology using overlay networks encrypted end to end. also we can do more privacy stuff on the bitcoin nodes. http://www.crn.com/news/security/231600847/300-000-iranian-ip-addresses-compromised-in-diginotar-ssl-hack.htmgood luck with that on silk road hey all! we have a new forum for libbitcoin + related projects... check it out:https://forum.unsystem.netwe also welcome other collaborators + projects to join and use the space. guys be sure to check out our forums!https://forum.unsystem.net/for all related projects darkwallet, libbitcoin, sx, ... and we welcome other collaborators to join us with their projects. We have a forum for collaboration and discussion of all related projects (darkwallet, libbitcoin, sx .etc):Forum: https://forum.unsystem.net/ hey! we have a forum for discussion about all related projects + coordination:https://forum.unsystem.net/We have the lobby which is a p2p protocol, and there's a lot of things possible through it. It's basically a secure chat which is used for negotiating coinjoins, multisigs, .etchere's a cool write up:http://coinjoint.info/dark-wallet-lobby-enables-secure-group-chat/ yep that's how ZeroCash and CoinJoin could work together. Both are pretty cool systems.CoinJoin would be for your day to day payments.ZeroCash would be for anonymising your savings.(I'm just projecting here don't know full details) It seems like their plan is to build a layer on top of Bitcoin like how MasterCoin works. And that the ZC ledger tracks the Bitcoin one so you can convert to and from the ZC system. That's really exciting if so. It sounds exciting from what I've heard, but it probably won't go into Bitcoin directly. We need to keep Bitcoin's consensus pure and untouched. We don't nearly know enough. what is it? 2 years of dev, & lots of workany description somewhere? docs .etchow does it work with bitcoin and what problem are you trying to solve? ok thanks for the clarification, makes sense now.caedes also gave me a similar explanation. I think it is.Here's how we did it in the initial CoinJoin implementation we made.* There's an anonymous chatroom (pre-negotiated shared secret in public room) accessible over Tor.* Some dudes submit various outputs.* Some dudes submit various inputs.* Server replies back with a tx.* Some dudes submit valid signatures.We also did it for fixed units. Your morals are not my morals. Who is the decider? Do you support a free and open internet?And yes, I definitely would like cheap medicinal knock off drugs flooding into the markets, and more kids playing with explosives and becoming scientists. Maybe you want to arrest people who write virus coding tutorials also?Your mistake is thinking that compliance buys curries you special favour... but at the risk of what? There are bigger things at stake here. Bitcoin is not unmovable code and math, it is consensus. It's imperative we develop this technology, strong, resilient and decentralised. Part of my goal is getting people to think and question things they've held as true. I think we can inspire an ideal through symbolic acts of disobedience, inspiring courage in others to stand with us.As you demonstrated in your post, the threat is real and here. The world has changed and it's time to adapt, survive and thrive. Either that or go extinct the way of the dinosaurs. And you know what? Maybe that threat you saw was more imagined than you realised. And maybe those threats, just maybe they were a paper tigers and fears unfounded. We will always be on the right side of history because we are about humanity. Dynamism, love, art, energy, change, passion, reality, risk, colour, soul.http://cultureandempire.com/ sorry Nicolas, was outside.I'm lurking and responding when back.btw is SX doing it correctly or not? maaku, the mixers are connected through a p2p protocol so anyone can set one up, however I think the idea (according to Peter Todd) is to use the Bitcoin network as a mixnet.I don't think we can use ring signatures unless bitcoin adopted ed25519... or am I mistaken?also it can scale >2 participants, because you do multiple rounds (share outputs, share inputs, give signatures).cbeast, self-censorship is why threat is so effective. the real people who will adopt our tools won't be yuppie students buying coffee at the bar, it will be new digital black markets & we market to them. the tools go beyond mere payments into governance, markets and new forms of association between humans. the effect is deeper. bitcoin is more than a payments innovation despite what others want to make us believe. I'm not shuffling its massive potential under the carpet through fear of retribution and spending my time making Facebook apps.
kinda sad darkcoin isnt implementing ring sigsmasternodes are coinjoin servers where miners must pay taxi'm interested to understand how that differs to federated darkwallet gatewaysstill, all power to drk... 4th crypto now yes being worked on kewl beans libbitcoin has to be rebuilt with testnet support, so you need to make clean libbitcoin, and ./configure needs the argument --enable-testnetI just looked, and the latest install script (with --testnet) wasn't uploaded. OK now I've re-uploaded it.So redownload http://sx.dyne.org/install-sx.sh and see the help text. try:$ make clean$ make...it probably didn't rebuild the modules I've bench-marked this a lot and can do millions and millions of rows with no problems. I've documented my database design on the Wiki and it isn't complicated. Also there's several optimisation techniques that can be adopted.The real problem is addresses in Bitcoin not sharing the same prefix (like stealth supports). try --enable-leveldbalso as per your question before, try installing under different users and configuring your environment variables accordingly (as install-sx.sh tells you). no, because you need sharding for different stealth address prefixes which is computed based on the metadata output. each output needs its own metadata. piotr we have tons of spammers trying to attack the Wiki. Until we have a solution (working on it), PM me your nickname and I'll authorise you. Also you can PM me on Freenode IRC (genjix) in #darkwallet thx, really good intro to stealth.

Also big improvements in parsing stealth since that's now going to a background thread, and the gateway got some bug fixed that was making things very slow  should now be snappy also using our block explorer will be a new experience Smiley.Best Regards!! can't wait to try out the android wallet. you guys should add sending to stealth addresses.http://sx.dyne.org/stealth.htmlhttps://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/DarkWallet/Stealth julia writes/films/edits her own stuff & is well read. here's her soliciting feedback for an article she's writing:http://lists.dyne.org/lurker/message/20140509.173056.2bf2c33c.en.htmlso in short, you're just a cunt.

soon I'm going to be removing the old electrum deterministic wallet commands. people should switch to using the newer HD commands which all wallets (electrum included) are adopting.

I'm not a miner so I can't vouch for its value or viability, but the OP has spent lots of time with us around the last few months and I can see he's genuine.We can partially act as overseer, but it's up to investors to do their due diligence in the end and be responsible for the risk of deciding to invest. We are just offering our recommendation of character and added information. you can still use the tools and we're running a public server at obelisk.unsystem.net:8081 yep although this error is caused by using an older version of boost yep, UK = stay awayfunny how far it's come.i've lived in iran, and england is not far off. what were the charges against you?was it a drug charge or why did they want your computer? haha you're a riot.op, yeah they can take your keys. it doesn't matter if they can't take your property or whatever since it's yet another piece of leverage that the police can use against you. once they have your keys, they can also take the funds from those keys and justify it with law (that's how the police operate). the thing is if you ever find yourself in these situations then don't give an inch, and use everything at your disposal to protect yourself. once you've given consent and compliance, you've opened yourself to be taken advantage of. import info for devs:https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/Libbitcoin#split_projectwill happen in around 2 weeks time. tryexcept, I'm on Freenode IRC as genjix in #darkwallet. Always happy to talk/help and show some of what we're doing. Maybe some of our work is useful for you, and vice versa. Choosing Electrum servers was a good choice, as that's a great community.About Obelisk, there isn't too much info yet but the tools are there. We're still improving them though and documenting everything. This file needs updating:https://github.com/saivann/bitcoin.org/blob/dev/COPYING It's OK, we did the darkwallet campaign. It's more about manpower to develop the tools since we're testing and improving the software. you're all so vicious. good luck OP in your endeavors. interested to see what new ideas you can develop. thanks. From now on use tcp://obelisk.unsystem.net:8081 as your server if you don't have one. No guarantees about uptime (at least for now) but I'll try to migrate it as I get more servers and maintain it as a public one. Just heard about this. Wow, very cool! Best of luck in your ventures cryptocyprus. nothing is impossible. some people see bitcoin like an unchangeable god that will bring paradise, when in fact it's a tool subject to the consensus of the people developing it. it will and does change.also who cares if bitcoin is anti or pro capitalist or whether you are an anarcho-something or *-libertarian? it's all loaded terms and labels when in fact it sounds like everyone is talking about the same issues. why don't we shift our discussion to something less utopic and more about the values encompassing our proposed social systems?

I recommend the GNU Free Documentation License.http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html looks exactly like the same letters intersango used to get. same format and everything we'd receive these out of the blue and be told to move banks within 1 week despite it taking 20 days to open bank accounts. if you don't want this to happen you need to be part of the bankers private club. Impressive work. Already better than most wallets out there. This space is going to heat up soon. You've fought about lots of nice features.Do you want to use Obelisk as the backend? We have a JS library:https://github.com/darkwallet/gateway/tree/master/client See this video I made about what's going on in the Bitcoin space:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRAYT2gaAqwLibertarians are being ostracised so they can make their moves on this market. I can be for world peace and work to promote world peace, eventhough world peace doesn't exist.Self organisation and owning your work are good values. If you are an entrepreneur then you self organise, manage your own risk and reap the rewards of your work while answering to no-one. I don't see why people would be so opposed to those trying to find ways to empower people, give them back sovereignty and promote a world of independent self-managed individuals.We don't always need to solve problems through centralised power structures like parliaments. There are other ways we can govern ourselves on a local level, flowing like water. It works for me and others, and part of the work is to grow this mindset in a population that is constantly being bombarded and brainwashed. If you taught every child how to make a business, people will be more free and there will be less wage slaves.Hakuna matata.
he is a good guy with solid intentions and awareness. Weird, because I'm testing on Debian Wheezy virtual machines. I'll look further, thanks.Edit: OK, I've changed it to a wildcard. ok, if you do then run the latest script. I've made lots of changes. I'm using Debian Wheezy, what are you using? When did you install it? When did you start the daemon? Are you using an SSD? I would recommend an SSD because a lot of the code assumes you're using SSDs (0 seek times) as I believe they're the future of storage. have you configured it to only connect to your bitcoind? if so, how many blocks does your bitcoind have? use ./bitcoind getinfo to see. if bitcoind has the correct number of blocks then try restarting obelisk and/or restarting bitcoind. does it start syncing? If anyone is using unSYSTEM Obelisk servers, then they will be upgraded today (Sun 16 March). If you experience problems with the new unSYSTEM servers, then upgrade SX:Code:$ wget http://sx.dyne.org/install-sx.sh$ sudo bash install-sx.shorCode:$ wget http://sx.dyne.org/install-sx.sh$ bash install-sx.sh /home/genjix/usr/You also have the option to run a different server with an older version of Obelisk, although I'll be encouraging operators to upgrade soon. List of servers: https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/Obelisk/Servers - let me know if you have a server to add to the list. Nope it looks fine. Those errors aren't a problem. Example: memory pool isn't full yet and there's txs depending on other txs in the mempool that aren't yours. It's normal. I'll make the wording sound less extreme.Important is that you're able to run 'sx fetch-last-height' and the block height matches blockchain.info or somewhere else.I need to document these tools better. Sorry about that. I'll be making efforts towards that goal as documentation is important. common production just makes sense. why work for anyone else but yourself. it's the only sustainable economic model and bitcoin empowers it. esp with multisig and other tools. i see many possibilities for using markets in this way.more than anything we can invest in technology and better industrial tools rather than buying tvs or other good given to us- long term we all end up better together.http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Practical_Post-Scarcity_Videoinstead of small toys (porsche, luxury apartment .etc), have the best and biggest toys (industry, farms, techno infrastructure, production, large scale construction). it's my aim https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/UnSYSTEM/OpenSource_cityDankon kaj mi kun vi, unu al la alia.Malfelicxe la plej bonaj ideoj ne cxiam sukcesas.

The client can specify a key, and theserver can specify which client pubkeys it will accept (or all) and awhitelist of IP addresses.See this config file for reference:https://github.com/spesmilo/obelisk/blob/master/src/worker/worker.cfg#L24The install-sx.sh script will be broken because of new dependencies .etc so I will fix it now. Sorry for any difficulties. Sorry about this. The install script should install those packages but the build stuff for sx and the rest of the libbitcoin-related tools need some work. iran is very important. if they said fuck it and allowed btc trade it would undermine US interests more than their own, but it would loosen the death grip of the suicidal regime. Basically I wouldn't be worried about some conspiracy. I'd be more worried if the developers represent corporate interests and are controlling development. There's a lot of deep difficult decisions in the code where it's not clear one path or another. If your agenda is even slightly corrupted then you will take the small decisions to benefit corporations over the black market/small businesses/p2p transfers. Corruption is not one big thing but many small decisions. Take the payments protocol as an example which uses CAs- it doesn't benefit small businesses, p2p transfers or the black market only corporations to reduce payment friction for them. That's why it's important to support alternative implementations that give a voice to empower different segments of the community as part of the development process.Anyone interested in alternatives should check out what we're doing with darkwallet - we have our own alternative & full stack of BTC software: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=372390.0 blaa blaa blaa walls of text. this is internet justice at its finest. anyone who leaks her info if they post an address will get lots of donations guaranteed. i don't know what went through her crazy mind to think this was ok. people need to call her and let her know it was wrong."this defenseless eccentric old man has $400m and he lives here <photo him> <photo house>." Way to reward our liberator. Irresponsible. The bindings are old and unmaintained. Sorry.If you want to use Obelisk from Python, we have a pure Python library:https://github.com/darkwallet/python-obelisk lol mike hearn wanted to use passports for auth between bitcoin nodes. what a newb. yeah wicked! lets do it. we have lots of smart people and some nice projects emerging. no, there's already too many subforums to wade through on this forum. i don't have time to open tons of tabs all the time.

We are offering free bouncers BTW if anyone wants one: https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/DarkWallet/BouncerThe unSYSTEM website should be our landing page, and we plan to syndicate a lot more stuff there but it needs work on both content and tech side (https isn't working):http://unsystem.net/d3 (admin for our projects) has setup https://libbitcoin.org/ now and I plan to move the website there, but we need to get the builds working, easy for me to push updates .etcWe also have mailing lists:https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/unsystemhttps://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/libbitcoinhttps://lists.unsystem.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/darkwalletWe definitely need to organise all these resources better.

Once everything is ready and I can try to compile libbitcoin (coordinating with you), then I can see what fixes need (if any) to be made to the code and maintain that by having my admin compile it every so often.Red Emerald does mac ports here, and I'd need help for packaging.

This attack only needs to work 1% of the time to be profitable but in reality can work much more (maybe even 100%) if pulled off correctly. You don't even need to tell the whole BTC network, just a few specific miners.For instance if I submit my replacement tx to eligius using their web interface, then make the trade before eligius mines a block, if eligius mines a block it won't include the tx that got 100% propagation because that would've been rejected by eligius.I suggest you remove this feature, and only using it for senders of BTC (not recipients).The localbitcoins thing otherwise looks excellent. Thanks for this contribution. I don't mean to beat on this parade and be so negative, I like your work. thanks for appreciation of my work, it's a nice donation. as an opensource coder, I love it when people to steal my work.e4xit- yeah the deadbeef is a 4 byte nonce. see:https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/DarkWallet/Stealthit's a (currently) unused scalability feature that will be enabled later once the number of stealth txs goes up.people will be able to reissue stealth keys and narrow the space of possible candidate txs from the blockchain to reduce the processing and traffic they need. in the beginning we might not even split the space so everyone's transactions can protect each other.normally you should brute-force different values until you find a hash where the first N bits matches what's specified by the stealth address. Since I'm using N=0, it doesn't matter what I put there - I'm using this for developing the server side stealth features in obelisk.it's a very smart feature from peter todd. bloom filters is not scalable, efficient nor really that private. pity people don't have software to do common tasks and need to resort to installing dodgy malware. anyway that will change with time.btw first stealth tx: https://blockchain.info/tx/63e75e43de21b73d7eb0220ce44dcfa5fc7717a8decebb254b31ef13047fa518testing code for those interested: https://github.com/genjix/stealth(implementation detail: it's currently using number_bits=0 so not using the prefix optimisation. this is only for my testing purposes.) With stealth and CoinJoin, Bitcoin is basically anonymous. These concepts are workable and will soon be delivered.https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/DarkWallet/StealthCoinJoin is already working since ages in all different ways and through tor too. You can use stealth using SX (command line tools): https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/Sx/StealthThese tools are not yet readily available for the common user but they will be.Together with other new emerging innovations, we will have decentralised uncensored crypto markets within this year. I've implemented some changes to stealth from Peter Todd.The nonce is now called 'ephemeral public key'.The stealth address format has changed slightly too.If needed, I can provide a conversion utility for old-style stealth addresses.This page is updated to reflect latest changes: https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/Sx/StealthDeveloper documentation about stealth: https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/DarkWallet/Stealth Open meeting from the local Barcelona Bitcoin community to our space where we work:http://www.meetup.com/bitcoin-barcelona/events/165069942/The place (Calafou) is an experiment into society building and constructing the industry/technology we need for our own self suffiency with our independence & liberty intact.

Are you able to provide a virtual machine image for me to take a look? BTW I'm genjix on #darkwallet on Freenode IRC What will be the MAX to STCY rate? Going to mine some of these so I can buy into the MAX market lol Unwilling coercion: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne8-mUibhc4Willful compliance:You sound compromised.What kind of man avoids his moral duty to save himself from prison. This isn't even in your own self interest unless you're paid well.I bet you think Satoshi was misguided. I think it's damn crap they disown themselves of their "friend" like this right away. Everyone distances themselves immediately. If this were a friend of mine, and I saw no moral wrong in their actions, damn straight I would be stirring the pot. It's not about Charlie did this or that. It's how quickly everyone distances themselves. It's like we are so concerned with how we look, rather than the substance of who we are. It's not like we suddenly discovered he's a paedophile. There's been some serious accusations levelled against this person based on their work with Bitcoin. Maybe he got greedy and saw an opportunity for more profit. But the point is that where is the solidarity? I don't see a huge injustice or big immorality here. I see a profiteer who did something with little harm (or even positive effect).What I do see, is an obsession with image. Yesterday he was a darling. Today he's a pariah. Would you treat someone you know and trust this way? Would you publically out them and distance yourself from someone you believe to be morally upstanding in the name of preserving your image? Or would you show them solidarity, and stand with them as a friend?Just because it's corporates in suits, doesn't excuse their actions. Even if you could see it happening. That you expect it to happen is a sad reflection of the world we live in. Flip flopping on friends and allies is sociopath behaviour. http://www.coindesk.com/charlie-shrem-resigns-bitcoin-foundation-silk-road-arrest/Charlie was one of the biggest advocates and architects of placating to power structures in order to curry favour.Now he has been neutralised and his friends wash their hands of him.Naturally this is painted in terms of his responsibility and guilt.This obsession with image affects how Bitcoin develops as a free market tool. Bitcoin's interest is advanced in different directions depending on the groups controlling it. If corporates and people working with central power dictate development, then satoshi's vision will evolve into CorpCoin. Software is art. Technology is never neutral. All technical decisions involve tradeoffs and the best path isn't always clear.

And why?I work with all sorts of people. Doesn't mean I need the consent or participation of police, legislators, corporations or other adversaries. That's simply common sense. And you didn't just talk to police, you support their actions. People working against your own users. This logic is deeply flawed. Note, nobody is not telling you not to meet with people. But this stance of currying favour by being willing to sacrifice your sovereignty in exchange is fucking dangerous! It's the same story why in the UK for instance, we ended up the IWF (a fake charity and shadow organisation) who censors the internet - despite no laws or regulation existing. It was an organisation formed preemptively by ISPs worried about the threat of censorship... Well we can see how that's turned out; it's ended up being the foot in the door for control freaks and now the UK internet is basically unusable with default filters on every new internet connection that requires national ID to opt-out to a weaker blacklist.You're willing to compromise on Bitcoin's fundamentals to help a few exchange businesses?! You can't trivialise regulation of cryptocurrency (possibly as fundamental as the internet) by comparing it to something meaningless. All this talk about placating to power is part of a deeper issue in Bitcoin. There's this dangerous attitude among the elite Bitcoin class that the anarchists invented this nice plaything but now it needs to be taken away from them and legitimised in order to become acceptable for everyone else. Note, this same attitude has played out with the internet. And anytime we didn't hold steadfast and resist, we lost our integrity forever.Do you honestly believe giving the people in power "warm fuzzies" does anything but empower them? Do you see yourself as a keizer soze type figure moving in powerful circles undermining their standing from within? Or is the reality more that you're compromising on what Bitcoin stands for in the name of pragmatism.Pragmatism is what people tell you when you try to do the right thing. It's an excuse to divert your attention from doing whats right because of fear. Fear of failure, fear of retribution, fear of whatever. "be pragmatic, be realistic", but in your heart you know that is only corruption speaking. It is through being "pragmatic" that we accept the situation as unchangeable and end up supporting a situation we don't support.You are being used as a figurehead to represent the viewpoints and interests of others to push their agenda. By remaining silent on issues, and remaining in their circles, you are consenting to their actions.
Are you trolling me? Lets work together says the guy that promoted the angle that I'm not a developer to the community and tried to have my participation censored.http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-09/13/digital-economy-task-force"Bitcoin, Tor and Gates Foundation join task force to prevent child exploitation"Don't tell me it's just about talking to the police. I'm sure you can rationalise it however you want. It sure starts that way. That's what people who run education seminars for the NSA or DoD tell themselves when you ask them. But they get paid for something. http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-09/13/digital-economy-task-force"Bitcoin, Tor and Gates Foundation join task force to prevent child exploitation"I feel like you all actually believe what you're saying which is sad beyond belief. How much money would you take from the dutch police to help them arrest a buyer of DMT from Silk Road, and so help clear up Bitcoin's image? Gavin, tainting any worries about powerful vested interests as conspiracy is manipulative. Either you are living a fantasy or being dishonest.Developers control the software they make. Developers represent interests. It's not conspiracy to be worried that power becomes vested in corporations and mafias *against* the individual and black markets.There are many deep technical decisions in the software that don't involve changing the protocol, and aren't clear to everybody. Sometimes it might be hard to make a decision one way or the other. When it's not clear, it's easy for corruption to tip the balance in favour of the big guy. And as Bitcoin grows, step by step it deviates, step by step it becomes corrupted.If you cannot see that, you are living in la la land. Branding others as crazy means you're delusional, not others. Especially now that the Snowden revelations have shown the global adversary as FACT. Currying favour is a weak move based on fear.You have the choice how you use your time and resources. We decide through individual action. How much are you willing to refuse to do the right thing? How about if it's a small bad for lots of money? It's easy to lose our confidence to hold steadfast and do what's right without justifying corruption in some way if we're not constantly vigilant.Note: I'm not talking about the meeting.

This is after spending years writing opensource code, seeing all that effort evaporate, feeling crushed and then vowing never to write code again. Now the whole thing has started again with bitcoin, and I sometimes question why I do these things.anyway I'm glad I read this poem yesterday: http://www.kipling.org.uk/poems_if.htm you haven't really said anything of substance yet that i can try to address. i think dht scales much better than bitmessage.and hand waving it away as just dht + blockchain is like handwaving away bitcoin as proof of work + signed timestamped messages. he's put a lot of thought into different use cases and built the primitives to support them (restype="single" or "multi"). and thought about scalability. i have confidence in this unless someone can tell me real problems. this is more elegant than retroshare. retroshare is lets put everything here. twister is next generation.maybe you can specify some of these problems? i've been emailing the author, and he's a very competent coder. my twister ids: @genjix @darkwallet Yes, you can bridge using gateways between 2 usernames. You can make this gateway easily using a Python script:http://twister.net.co/?page_id=120It's limited to 140 chars because that's optimal but AFAIK I don't think it's a fixed limit in the protocol. if this happens unsystem will invest resources to continue developing it under the same name keeping the same layout. there's a lot more possible with this:https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/Twister/Ideasit could enable many of the difficult to use crypto features of bitcoin like managing a multisig, negotiating some of the contracts, requesting a key to generate new receiver addresses (for privacy). there are many possibilities. it could even obsolete and replace the payment protocol. https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/Libbitcoin/Open_tasksfeel free to send me an email <myusername>@riseup.net piotr, its not just about backdoors but about bias in tech decision making. if legit corporations are the ones paying devs salaries, then they will choose the best decisions to benefit corporations and optimise for their use case. and who would be there representing the enterprising individuals and making the software better for them. you're looking too black and white at the things. i'm saying decentralise everything is good for a healthy ecosystem.note these are tech decisions. i didnt even get into stuff like blacklists, drm, tracking which actually attack users. those can also happen if we're not vigilant. justusranvier explained it well: http://bitcoinism.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/did-you-get-good-price-when-you-sold-out.html i want limitations to be removed too. i just don't want new extensions to the protocols (make them rarer). or huge changes/rework stuff.if you think blockchain = consensus, then lets make it a constitution that resists being revised. this is the future of crypto messaging:http://twister.net.co/better than bitmessage. inspired by bitcoin. uses bittorrent with a blockchain. made by former xine dev. uses libtorrent (libbitcoin was inspired by libtorrent).this is it.more info:https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/TwisterFreenode IRC #twisterwhitepaper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7152 re: twister and other protocol layers.the argument to use the bitcoin blockchain is that it offers absolute security. by using a new chain, some portion of that power can peel off and attack you. this means that alt chains will always have trouble getting through that initial hump where they are vulnerable to mining attacks.however alt chains increasingly serve a variety of market purposes (such as twister). there's varying degrees of risk on how much X mining power is likely to be used (like when pools attack some altcoins in the past to prove a point), but if the market incentive is greater and grows quickly enough it can get past this hump.especially now since the bitcoin blockchain is associated with money and has a high level of security (money demands high level of security), it's difficult to design a successful altcoin. but there are chains providing other purposes and can tolerate more risk. they are also optimised for their use case and so more efficient than simply relying on bitcoin blockchain, and hence far cheaper.twister is the best example of this. i've been thinking and they've made the right decision making an altchain. it's the future, and i think beats bitmessage. i'm making some notes here:https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/Twisteredit: changed my mind about twister. It's more nuanced than that. we can use a combination. see this discussion here:https://groups.google.com/d/msg/twister-users/cgxyB2oOQkk/Ov-MUUv3uG4JThis is a good project using an altchain: http://ethereum.org/ethereum.html there needs to be a incredible amount of friction against modifying bitcoin's rules. some of these issues are very complex and less than a handful of people understand them worldwide. what happens when you as a user, have no-one representing your interest in that circle. great we have a mailing list and an irc #darkwallet on freenode for your q
any dev who makes the argument about having 1 bitcoin is talking rubbish. bitcoind itself has changed massively since its inception and will continue to do so. the problem is people are too trigger happy to go and make destructive changes to the bitcoin consensus core which is both dangerous and harms consensus. bitcoin should be kept pure and simple. sorry but i don't want all the contracts and new prototype theoretical features thrown into bitcoin. by all means use the blockchain (people will anyway), but this stuff is so new. bitcoin should be left alone because it works, and needs to be protected.for example:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f5857e5cthe sighash is one of the hardest parts of bitcoin. this is not a place Iwould optimise.compare both versions:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f5857e5cb5fb03bee9c05d1dd6ba2621cac49179/src/script.cpp#L978https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/881a85a22d76c875f519cd54388a419ec6f70857/src/script.cpp#L976don't mean to criticise sipa since he is working hard. but this is your precious code by satoshi having a radical redesign. qrius1111 did you use the install-sx.sh script? http://sx.dyne.org/install-sx.shI recommend all to use git until next release which is coming soon. Hi, I've been upgrading the server to the latest ZMQ.Try an alternative one here:maybe this one: tcp://obelisk.bysh.me:9091Change it in your .sx.cfg (you can copy the file from PREFIX/share/sx/sx.cfgedit: retry now, I was upgrading the servers but they're back now. I don't want Bitcoin to change. Changing and extending the protocol/standard is the worst thing we can do. There's far more important stuff that needs to be done implementation side. Moving forwards means freezing the standard, that's why I want to diversify. yep but it all starts somewhere. eventually we will use these things for many uses, and it will be very powerful. pure trade is the way. think what the internet did for publishing. I'm excited about these developments as more than just a twitter or Bitmessage drop in replacement.they have the potential for things like silk road seller pages or blogs. I wrote more here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=379080https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/DarkWallet/Overview#Messaging_layer that async principle is a solid one to create for a bitcoin impl.been checking in on btcd every so often, and the design/arch decisions are solid.the code is the spec is a bit of a crap base for the future of finance and something we'll leave behind. the more of us there are, the quicker bitcoin will move forward. decentralise everything and distribute the power. we need a solid infrastructure and the bitcoind is really poor.yes omg this is terrible. output scripts dont even need to parse. but there's plenty more like the copy paste serialization code, deeply nested locking mechanisms, cscript inheriting an std:: container (forbidden by standard), undefined behaviour (using integer loop around / invalid casts), non-modular code, ... more i can't recall right now A new one, http://twister.net.co/?page_id=25 http://symas.com/is-lmdb-a-leveldb-killer/ who gives a f what its called. we all know its happening.

Then use these to fetch that actual data from a DHT network. This takes *a lot* of pressure off the blockchain from people who want to throw lots of data at it, and allows you to potentially use this scheme to allow gigabytes of data to be retrieved. It's basically proof of sacrifice.I think this has many many very useful future applications. If we have our privacy aware wallets, identity, p2p communication (BitMessage or even XMPP) and distributed reputation, then together with the tools for managing multisig (distributed escrow), we can use this innovation so sellers can maintain their own page of goods that can be updated.Think something like Tor or Freenet but fast to load and encrypted. All these tools together enable a decentralised Silk Road. If the seller on the remote end is a robot, then you could communicate with the robots over p2p encrypted protocols to send messages and update the page (like a forum or Wiki). There's very many possibilities from this tech. I especially like using the blockchain as an authority for human usable names for identities and cipherweb locations.btw maybe you should pay to people when you retrieve the file. therefore depending on how fast you want the file, you put up an auction and gather the bids, then a special transaction is created for atomically exchanging the file for your credit (as agreed by the bid). yes, i love it.

In this way we are helping to build a better future. Values: privacy, scalability, integrity. See more info in our docs.Obelisk: scalable blockchain query infrastructureObelisk is a scalable blockchain query infrastructure. See the setup guide. There is a public server available at obelisk.unsystem.net:8081 but I wouldn't use it for anything production (besides testing). Uses libbitcoin for asynchronous full node Bitcoin implementations on the backend that connect to a load balancer. The load balancer distributes blockchain requests among the workers on the backend.sx command line utilities - Empower The Sysadmin With Bitcoin ToolsMy aim with this project is to provide a set of modular Bitcoin commandline utilities, that admin types can engage with Bitcoin functionality without having to write code. By chaining all these commands together in different ways, you can do offline transactions, maintain a wallet, work with deterministic keys, ...It would be cool to see Bitcoin wallets written in bash script using these tools to handle the core functionality. I believe the more we give good tools to the community, the more we can decentralise development and increase access to the core technology for all types.python-obeliskThis is a collaboration between Pablo Martin's ZMQ/Obelisk implementation, and Robert Williamson's blockalchemy library with code from ThomasV's Electrum. python-obelisk is a pure Python client-side implementation of the Obelisk protocol. A pure Python library is great because it can be deployed easily without requiring dependencies. This allows code to be ported across many platforms such as the mobile phone with Kivy, desktops or any platform running Python.sx wallet: ncurses terminal walletdat.wallet: pure Python tutorial wallet for Linux, Android, Mac, WindowsMe and Taylor Gerring (Hive wallet) coded this example wallet in 2 days in pure Python. It uses python-obelisk and is meant to be be an example for other coders to understand how wallets work. We'll work slowly on more tutorials and docs. It uses kivy and has no dependencies, so can be used on the mobile phone.This is great for wallet developers and GUI designers who want to create their own skin or special wallet with specific features. For example: wallets for traders, branded wallets for businesses and specific payment applications that use wallet functionality.DarkWallet browser pluginThe beginnings of the DarkWallet project. We are focusing mainly on the underlying technology and how to create usable crypto products for the entrepreneurs of the future.

We'll work slowly on more tutorials and docs.It uses kivy and has no dependencies, so can be used on the mobile phone.This is great for wallet developers and GUI designers who want to create their own skin or special wallet with specific features. For example: wallets for traders, branded wallets for businesses and specific payment applications that use wallet functionality.The code is not great, but it is merely instructive for people to understand how to use the underlying Bitcoin library and functionality.https://github.com/darkwallet/dat.wallet http://cooperativa.cat/en/do-it-yourself-calafou_hacklab-at-dark-wallet-meeting/productive meeting in milan. see update on indiegogo page.
Your email is too long and looks like spam. No one is ever going to read that. Especially if it goes to low level employees first. You link a Bitcoin website as your source. Thanks to rbdrbd, in Obelisk there are now init.d scripts, setup script and logrotation:https://github.com/spesmilo/obelisk/tree/master/scriptsGoing to be testing these. Would appreciate any feedback to improve them. There's a setup script, obbalancer init.d script, obworker init.d script and obworker log rotation script.Questions to everyone:1. Where should the scripts normally reside on your system? Would the setup script be installed with the package?2. What's the standard GNU way of distributing them? scripts/? How would I name them?Thanks. just been reading about this. I'm not an admin guy but docker sounds really cool. update any progress you make on this.we have a wiki: https://wiki.unsystem.net/let me know your user if you make an account saluton amiko!have you tried obelisk?c++ lib: https://github.com/spesmilo/obelisk/blob/master/include/obelisk/client/blockchain.hpppython lib: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=354607based off libbitcoin: http://libbitcoin.dyne.org/also http://sx.dyne.org/ I've created a new library which will have non-critical code (likedeterministic wallets, key formats and selecting outputs) ported fromlibbitcoin to libwallet.This will keep libbitcoin focused on its core functionality. The clientside stuff is less important considering all the wallet development donein Python, JavaScript .etc libbitcoin is aimed at server software.https://github.com/spesmilo/libwalletThe install-sx.sh has been updated to reflect this. Users simply need tore-run the script to update.-------------BTW we have a mailing list: https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/libbitcoin http://sx.dyne.org/multisig.html https://medium.com/p/7f95a386692flast paragraph https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/DarkWallet/DesktopCounterpartAlso the tech we build will benefit other wallets which we can also take code from like Kryptokit or SpareCoins. So we provide backend and devs can make the frontend. We have a long term vision for this stuff. http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bitcoin-dark-walletWe made it!Time for updates. This is an exciting moment. We've been slaving, writing code for 3 years now through hardship and all kind of opposition. With these funds, we can invest wisely into critical things blocking our progress and help the Bitcoin space to grow. We are social entrepreneurs, and our goal is to use technology to affect a new way of life.Here's an interview with Peter Todd (aka retep). Peter is a well reknowned Bitcoin thereotician. He helped create the trustless mixing concept and chose the CoinJoin name. Peter has also co-developed the more recent CoinSwap proposal- a highly technical for ultra anonymity of sending Bitcoins. Peter is responsible within the community for researching and creating new concepts to improve privacy of Bitcoin transactions, scalability of the blockchain and a well functioning network.Peter Todd interview, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb-QHhbKMAYThe meeting was a success. Our community is well organised, super passionate and with lots of spliff. We've set our goals and reached consensus with how we want to progress. More important than the project itself, is bringing the right minds together to collaborate on a vision. We can write code, but it's about writing tools for the future not tech toys only we will use.During the meeting, Taylor Gerring (Hive wallet) and Amir Taaki (libbitcoin) created dat.wallet, a new Android Bitcoin wallet by leveraging DarkWallet technology. Amir says "just like when we created trustless mixing, we were able to use our tools to very quickly create a prototype Bitcoin application."libbitcoin, the base for our development efforts has been a long time in development. We have an extensive toolset and scalable architecture. Now we are deploying our infrastructure for production. This will entail extensive testing on multiple platforms and distribution efforts. In development are new components to better handle the blockchain and network.Here is a prototype which you can find in our git repo. Sem (frontend developer) says "We had to go initially with a Chrome extension despite preferring Firefox. Chrome has a more stable API which enables rapid development during the early stages. Later we will port the code to Firefox. It's written to be easy to port."Note: we don't recommend Google Chrome. Use Chromium or Firefox (better).For those who need more juice, see the DarkWallet living document which details our ideas for DarkWallet in more depth.Dark Wallet wants to enable the power of crypto for users of the web. We are the developing the tools that will empower web developers to create services utilising the full power of Bitcoin.Interview with Wendell Davis of Hive wallet, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn3m_K5AJecIntro video, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuPo5NJ-AZQ Hey,Here are video interviews from Milan.Peter Todd, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb-QHhbKMAYWendell Davis, Hive wallet creator, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn3m_K5AJecEvent overview, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuPo5NJ-AZQ This looks like a problem with LevelDB.

I'm assuming that each digit represents a dice roll from 1 to 6. https://github.com/darkwallet/python-obelisk/See examples/ directory.This is a collaboration between Pablo Martin's ZMQ/Obelisk implementation, and Robert Williamson's blockalchemy library with code from ThomasV's Electrum.Obelisk is a scalable blockchain query infrastructure. See the setup guide. There is a public server available at 37.139.11.99:9091 but I wouldn't use it for anything production (besides testing).A pure Python library is great because it can be deployed easily without requiring dependencies. This allows code to be ported across many platforms such as the mobile phone with Kivy, desktops or any platform running Python.Features:* Blockchain queries and navigation through Obelisk servers.* Construct & sign transactions.* BIP32 hierarchical wallet.* Traverse the blockchain using a syntax similar to Django ORM / SQL alchemy.Use cases:* Website payment backend (store and manage the keys yourself).* Wallet software. Ah man I was an early adopter but I spent now millions worth of BTC already. Was having trouble even affording socks this summer. But had lots of fun along the way and there's more cool stuff to do. Bitcoin is not even 1% yet of its potential. oh this is wicked! this is exactly what I wanted! can I include them in the project? never done it, but when our infrastructure is more setup (after crowd funding) we will be deploying/testing/making builds. Sorry about your dog. I'm powerless to help here. If it's any consolation, I spent this summer going through a lot of hardship like cold and sickness due to lack of money. Patrick has no reason to steal and he's not like that. hey, that email is just a bunch of whining. I reimplemented Bitcoin because all the internal parts are highly connected. Your validation code is linked to blockchain, network and script subsystems. It was a purely technical decision. In the beginning (early 2011) I started by refactoring the Satoshi codebase (made Python bindings and improvements in a custom fork) but the entire thing is total crap and tightly coupled. I decided if Bitcoin is the future then we need a solid foundation to build upon. Rewriting Bitcoin from scratch by comparison is not a big deal in the long perspective.his complaint is invalid. satoshi is not a god. we write code, improve the software and move forwards. Bitcoin is not some mythical codebase.The blockchain is bigger since it is optimised for servers. I'm thinking primarily about scalability then performance. bootstrap.dat is supported thanks to Robert Williamson. I'm working on supporting luke-jr's eloipool but a lot of the mining stuff is new to me and I'm preoccupied with dark wallet this month. stop asking the foundation to solve development issues.http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bitcoin-dark-wallet The script subsystem only requires the tx you are signing.The point is more succinct - avoid extending the Bitcoin standard.I would also like a SIGHASH flag where you can specify a specific output to sign (so you can specify change address with pledges for SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY), but I don't think it's a good idea to change Bitcoin's current design. More dependencies and execution paths = poor design = insecure code. We should be taking things out, not putting in. I've had many many experiences with police. 80% are just doing a job to pay rent (so was Hitler's SS) and 20% love their job, going way beyond the call of duty to enforce laws and get at 'bad types' they don't like (sometimes bending or breaking the law). They break into houses, arrest people for assault, beat people up (off camera), follow and harass you, ... they are not all good people and I don't support their work which is mostly being a pawn of powerful interests that collaborate with wealthy groups to fuck you.Here's 3 PRISM slides from the NSA:I don't know what more kind of proof people need that the police are corrupt, and we don't need to help make their work easier with applying law to bitcoin (in their own interpreted way).you know the blacklist in the UK which was originally only for child porn and now blocks 'hate speech', copyright infringement, 'bad porn' and the pirate bay was originally formed as a consensus amongst ISPs after the metropolitan police put pressure on Demon internet. the same steps are now happening with bitcoin and it's looking semi-legit with people justifying it. but even a cursory look at internet history will show you what the slippery slope this is and we must fight hard against this tooth and nail. not later, but now. now is the time to fight for your freedom, not later once everything is compromised. did you see the task force?http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-09/13/digital-economy-task-forcethis is pandering in the hope of being spared from harsh treatment. nothing good will come of this.bitcoin is what it is: world changing technology.the printing press fundamentally altered old power structures against their will. so too will bitcoin. we haven't even begun to explore the possibilities it brings. we don't need to ask permission. the market is here and won't be stopped. we need to be bold and brazen in how we nurture this early and exciting technology.it is a tool of the black market. it will transform humanity for the better. government education begins and ends with those statements - nothing more. we don't need anything the legacy system has to offer. sooner or later, the people will come around as the pull of bitcoin will be too strong. from the ashes of a corrupted system rises a bold new paradigm for global humanity. ... corrupt lovers of power and control freaks. mike, your bitcoin users are silk road users. why are you helping the police? they don't use bitcoin.are you going to quit your job at google now it's public they are collaborating with the NSA. or does google pay too well? how much is the NSA offering bitcoin developers?behind closed doors we don't know what's happening and who at which corporation is now being tasked to write code against bitcoin users to protect their business interests or even with a hefty salary from law enforcement themselves. +4I've worked with Animazing before on Electrum and he's a solid developer you want in your community. Sorry but I don't think this is worth hard forking Bitcoin over. For validating a signature we currently need only the input (if it's signed). This change increases the number of dependencies for signature checking code. Namely Bitcoin validation nodes now need to fetch the previous output. This could seriously complicate the design and functionality of Bitcoin nodes if widely used. It is a good idea, but there are many ways to improve Bitcoin. I'm not sure Bitcoin is made for these things and should stay more simple and focused (like UNIX vs the other operating systems).http://www.gwern.net/Bitcoin%20is%20Worse%20is%20Better?2Bitcoin works because it doesn't try to do much. If we want to maintain a decentralised and open Bitcoin, I think it's a bit of a slippery slope to throw every feature we get excited about into Bitcoin. The risk is bigger than you realise. It isn't even overt mailicious features that don't require changes to Bitcoin itself, but small corruption of Bitcoin in deep underlying hard-to-perceive ways.It's not only bugs but the values of the programmers and how they mold the software. For instance there are deep issues in the protocol where the decision is not always clear (and the community is ignorant of them). If you work for a corporation, your choices are going to be different to the guy running black markets and doing p2p trades. You just both value different feature sets and the software optimised in a different way.From this article: https://letstalkbitcoin.com/the-regulation-of-bitcoin/Blacklists from both the merchant and the miner (prefer to build off blocks with txs containing whitelisted addresses) will push Bitcoin users towards monitoring. We need a strong hard push against this stuff right now. We need to be vocal and build tools for black markets. Pretending we are friends of the NSA is not helping our cause. It's not only bugs but the values of the programmers and how they mold the software. For instance there are deep issues in the protocol where the decision is not always clear (and the community is ignorant of them). If you work for a corporation, your choices are going to be different to the guy running black markets and doing p2p trades. You just both value different feature sets and the software optimised in a different way.From this article: https://letstalkbitcoin.com/the-regulation-of-bitcoin/"If development is too centralized, with a small core infrastructure, then businesses will put real pressure to have features that destroy the integrity of the Bitcoin network. The excuse will be to protect themselves from liability. Self-censorship.And what they demand does not have to be protocol changes. They will demand features in the software they use. Software which remains compatible with the network, but works against the interests of individuals, small businesses and the black market.The possible malicious scenarios are endless. Stuff like p2p blacklists to create a legitimate walled garden, or tracking technologies like large databases of IP addresses to triangulate where transactions came from. At the other end of the spectrum, is putting development effort into diversifying the ecosystem to protect against censorship and proxy relay nodes, anonymizing mixers, small privacy tweaks and other technologies. Thats where developers who believe in Bitcoin should devote time to. Corporations are powerful enough. To developers: serve your community." This is a really cool project and I think you can go either further. I would like if we're altogether to organise an assembly for discussion of these ideas.

They are voluntary but if you want to be part of the community, well you should be respecting and working for the people. It'd be cool to have other projects come join unSYSTEM and help establish a support network for Bitcoin projects and cool initiatives. If anyone wants to come participate in development, you're more than welcome.https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/DarkWallet/Meeting_Nov2013This is the event for starting everything. We have more public talks in the first week of December, and spaces if people need a place to sleep (although it will be quite busy). If you have a proposal for a talk or need a bed then send me a PM. Feel free to visit if you're around.Our mailing list:https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/unsystem to make coinjoin work properly we first need decentralised identity and reputation systems to protect against that. otherwise just making it p2p for the fun of it is not doing anything. some people worship profit: https://darkwallet.unsystem.net/bitcoinica.htmlbitcoin attracts the worst types of lying sociopaths. Gavin, anyway it's good you support other implementations. Thanks for the positive words. https://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/?p=204 - the projects there were incomplete implementations and mostly recent.Truth is that there are development decisions happening behind closed doors that me, other developers and the community are not privy to. And this places the class of developers (not your friends) at a disadvantage due to institutionalised structures imposed on bitcoin development. This is why I believe in a diversified software ecosystem with no single party having power over development decisions - it is a process that can be corrupted by personal preference and favoritism.Also about libbitcoin's quality: http://libbitcoin.dyne.org/doc/ - any objective developer is open to review the fundamentals. We are providing an alternative. With 1% of the BF resources, we will do 10x more development and continue serving the community. Free market ftw. Gavin can you explain this email from a journalist friend that he sent me:"Just got a call from the bitcoin foundation. They wouldn't go on the record to comment on the article but just kept telling me "off the record" that you lot have no credibility and that a much better story is some venture capitalist yesterday investing $9m in bitcoin..."and are you going to put me back on the security mailing list after you took me off. And you should stop telling people I'm not a Bitcoin developer. And also list libbitcoin on your blog post. Also you can stop ignoring my emails, and invite me into the protocol discussions. Thanks. The door is open, the choice is yours.It's been 3+ years and I think the treatment from you, Mike, .et al has been downright cuntish at times. https://darkwallet.unsystem.net/whydw.html50k won't go far if we pay salaries. we have to be smart with the money and invest in common permanent infrastructure. we should find better ways to pay for ongoing costs by creating sustainable businesses. I've had the feeling this was the direction we've been moving in for a while. Now the eager response of Hive is a welcome addition.The Linux operating system came together when Linus' kernel was combined with the GNU system. If we wish to build a resilient and successful opensource ecosystem, then it will need the combination of projects responsible for a small piece of turf. It will force us to serve each other and create something very powerful.When I got involved with Electrum, my goal was to replace the backend with libbitcoin. I saw Electrum as the future. Electrum's community and technology get me very excited. It's an open community, with lots of solidarity (despite the small size) and people helping out with infrastructure in a decentralised self-organised way.As I started to develop on Electrum (which involved refactoring the server code to support pluggable backends), I became concerned with the UI. Over 2-3 months I did my own usability studies with friends and people, and started to focus on how Electrum should look like. Then there was more refactoring of the client code so we could integrate another GUI. During this time also saw Animazing becoming involved in development and he also had lots of ideas.The original libbitcoin Electrum backend, was a fullnode integrated straight into Electrum server. However I didn't believe this was a scalable model. After the bitcoin2012 conference, I took a big break from Bitcoin for some months (the conference was too much). During this time, I started to formulate new ideas about a backend, slowly hacking prototypes at first, theorising, writing more code, rewriting, trying different approaches, ... The moving from Apache Thrift to ZeroMQ was a massive leap. I have a hero worship problem with the ZMQ creator Pieter Hintjens  I think he's a genius.http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#toc7And obelisk was born.The community around libbitcoin started to grow, and we slowly developed our software. We started to plan between ourselves the tools and code needed to build a functional wallet. I still wasn't sure whether we'd go with Electrum or make something new. I remember when trying to integrate the light GUI into Electrum, it wasn't so modular (tight coupling between GUI and wallet).Then we had the Barcelona Electrum developer meeting, and Electrum's new release was impressive. Thomas had re-architected Electrum into a modular framework, and was rapidly integrating features like HD wallets. We also saw the Electrum Android preview from Andy which was awesome. Never seen such a great wallet on mobile phones - and it's based off Electrum and Python! Andy is working with Kivy developers to build the thing.The new aim for Electrum is a modular framework for creating wallets. The framework provides the features and you just hook them into an interface. Thomas demoed a terminal Electrum app to illustrate this.I spoke with Pablo because I wasn't sure how to support Electrum. Before my intention had been to make an adapter that provided the current Electrum API (so clients could remain compatible with minimal changes to the Electrum codebase), but this was sub-optimal and doesn't take advantage of the parallel asynchronous scalability features (which needs some knowledge from the API user to use effectively). Also with multiple workers you need to be able to handle failure cases to retry a different host or know how to properly query results.Pablo suggested the way forwards in replacing the client side Electrum blockchain query code with obelisk API. This was a problem though since Electrum is a Python-only project and the current obelisk was a C++ library. Also even if we made a Python obelisk then it will still depend on ZMQ. Since there was the Electrum Android Kivy project (and we're interested in phones too), we tried building ZMQ on the mobile phone. It was a nightmare and we never got it working (I don't think it's ever been managed). Pablo did the unthinkable and rewrote ZMQ in pure Python! Pieter Hintjens (project maintainer for ZMQ) was excited and wants to make it an official part of ZMQ. So we have a pure Python obelisk library.By moving some of the Electrum core utils (such as bitcoin.py) into his project, we have a full Python wallet software library. Also Vitalik made Pybitcointools for working with keys, and Robert (a libbitcoin contributor) created a good abstraction layer for the blockchain which makes it look like a Django database ORM (for the blockchain). So we can move this functionality into a library, and prefer friend's code (so they own that piece of the ecosystem).The technology in Electrum is solid, but it needs a decent UI. My only concern is that if we have worker -> balancer -> desktop core -> interface, that's a lot of overhead for transferring wallet history but maybe it's not such a big deal in the end. Also I'm working on some important issues to do with the blockchain database. I've been developing a custom database.This is database read and write speed for Bitcoin transactions vs LevelDB. Note these results are merely illustrative. There's a lot more complex things happening underneath that's difficult to explain (I will write a manual). But by exploiting the properties of the blockchain leads to some interesting results such as hot backups, lock-free reads and lack of a separate database cache (instead use madvise() to tell the kernel how to cache from disk). Anyway this is experimental stuff. Read speed is my priority.Together we can create a big group of talented developers freeing up the others to focus on our particular development interests. I see the potential in Hive for security features and concepts Thomas is working on in Electrum. There is the old conflict between the top-down cathedral with the ability to mobilise huge resources through command hierarchies, vs the bottom-up bazaar that provides the creative and open environment for merit to rise to the top. Debian is the Linux kernel, the GNU system tools, the graphics layer, the Gnome desktop environment and the various applications. I am optimistic that we can create the same resiliency and strength for the future of money. 50% raised in 24 hours (including BTC donations)looks like electrum, hive and libbitcoin are going to find a way we can all work together. everybody wins because developers can focus on one thing and we can build a diverse modular opensource software ecosystem. with the libbitcoin, obelisk, sx, mixer, proxy broadcaster, python desktop libs, python desktop core (electrum) and interfaces created by hive team, we will have an awesome setup for everyone.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=322483.0I was already before developing electrum, and hive wallet is doing a really good job at what I was trying to achieve before (and not getting far). all our projects can help each other, and I aim with the crowdfunding to offer common infrastructure towards this effort. combine libbitcoin + electrum + hive: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=322483.0 Hi,All 3 of these projects are lacking things that we each have.The server part of the libbitcoin stack is well developed, but we're still working towards client-side software for managing wallets. I was very impressed by Thomas' presentation about how he's turning Electrum into a framework. However the backend for Electrum is lacking, and also the servers are unreliable. We have built the client side libraries (Pablo's pure Python ZeroMQ + Pablo's obelisk-client + Vitalik's Pybtctools + Robert's BlockAlchemy). This removes any need for dependencies (pure Python) and can easily be deployed on Android (through Kivy).I'm imagine a core on the desktop with an API over sockets that can only be called on localhost (although maybe do something else). Exchange the Electrum interface and start using the new library (move Electrum code over to it too, and provide a nice API).Hive is even further in front of the user. The Electrum user interfaces suck (despite the technology being very good). And they're really thinking on different things. If we have a separate Python core with a socket, then it's possible to integrate with their C#. They already have their server backend and Electrum has one too, and so no point us all duplicating the same work when I've been doing backend/impl stuff for ages.libbitcoin - server / core API stuff* libbitcoin/obelisk server - me, Robert Williamson* Client side library: Pablo, Vitalik and Robert.** ZMQ (networking library) Python port by Pablo.** Daemons like broadcaster or mixer written in Python for rapid development.

This thread marks a landmark for humanity. It's not about mining, it's about the process how you're all working. Shocked Satoshi would think that since he's often showed a lot of foresight.And I was shut out of development and prevented from doing work in the early days. So I went my own way because I see Bitcoin development differently to the current Bitcoin establishment.----------Good news everyone! The Python front is progressing nicely!http://libbitcoin.dyne.org/labs.htmlPeople creating cool stuff. My goal now is to get these projects all merged together into one pure Python package for wallet developers. I've been questioned by police, solicited by undercovers into doing stuff, been black listed from banks with my accounts closed and they tried to recruit me once to join them. No worries, we're all at different stages of beginner. Would be cool to have a listing of the latest crypto news stories. you need to accept the entity into your heart for it has a message to spread to you, for your body is a child vessel in the spirit realm of dank. Fixed.https://github.com/spesmilo/libbitcoin/commit/e543599b3ac37e4f30370bbf7c1323de1c71fba2I patched this on the website tarball too. Hmm strange, anyway I'm upgrading to latest Ubuntu 13.10. Will post a fix here afterwards.Windows/Mac: in around 1 month (next release). I've got both platforms working before but unsupported. Cool website! I like it! Have you through about replacing the front page forum with a chat box? Did you guys see http://flowingmail.com/ yet? I reached out to the devs & think their project can go far. Love it! Please make more videos! Everyone should keep a copy of this site's HTML pages to check against other websites in the future. He might reappear under different usernames with rebranded projects. This is not a productive thread for me. I can be contacted via PM if anyone has any questions or needs anything. Putting the site back up is unethical. And who wanted to buy the site? What would they do afterwards? I hope that's not Patrick. Roger Ver is representing himself and his buddy Tihan. He didn't like the releasing of the code, because he wanted a piece of pie. Despite the pie actually being shit. But that doesn't matter when $$$. This is why Patrick is hesitant I think. I don't know the specifics, but the sentiments are clear. I'm a contractor and programmer who was hired to work on the hedging algorithm (site was losing money since months). I had no access to funds or the server (I'm talking about myself, not any of my other team members).I have no power except to sign documents by the owners which allow them to give up responsibility even further or shift blame. If they want to do anything, they have the power. If there was anything I could have done, I would have done it rather than spending time on the forum communicating with people. And despite that, Tihan, Zhou, and everyone are well off and rich. Zhou was being paid 15k USD per month. I'm a opensource coder (still here and giving tools for the people since 3+ years), and no money supported by friends around me. I'm not trying to get sympathy, but some people are under the mistaken assumption we (Intersango) were some kind of rich company. We are motivated and passionate people who believe in Bitcoin living on the edge. Bitcoinica was an opportunity for us to create more Bitcoin projects. Anyway lesson learned, I'm never getting involved in other people's services and dodgy agreements like NDAs or partnership contracts (for shares in fake companies that don't exist by scammers who hide behind the shield of being an intermediary despite being the real owner). This is fucking stupid shit. You wanted to put the insecure site back up for personal profit. You were also an investor in Bitcoinica. I could not allow that.And why was a random piece of code (used for something unrelated) used as the password for a site where all the passwords were stored? And how did the attacker know the login and everything? Oh yeah it was Zhou, and a convenient excuse for him. wipeout is not a videogame. it's a way of life.
Hi all, I'm part of a project near Barcelona called Calafou with other Bitcoin developers here. We have the Bitcoin Magazine people here too. Feel free to connect with us.http://unsystem.net/incubator/ This is probably some small group within them. A subsidiary. I'm not getting excited. maybe this?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=259999http://sx.dyne.orgor even an obelisk sever too so you have a fullnode blockchain running.http://libbitcoin.dyne.org/http://libbitcoin.dyne.org/libbitcoin.pdf Looking for feedback and critique of my argument. Read the whole thing before commenting.If you prefer to hear my voice, here's a recording:http://letstalkbitcoin.com/e49-disruptive-people/----------------------------------------------------------------------------The libbitcoin ManifestoAs humans, we share little in common. But that little we do share is the deep core of our being. We search for purpose. We are curious. And we thrive on new information. Our self-awareness, rationality and sapience are the high level features that make up a person. They are our capacity for good or evil.As people, we need to ask ourselves whether we act with purpose, intent and ambition; ask how are we defining ourselves, and what are the values that our lives are promoting.Are you taking concrete steps now to achieve your objective?Its important we ask ourselves these questions, and decide which end of the spectrum between liberty and security we fixate on. A safe life of luxury, and comfort closed in by 4 walls- or a life of freedom. Freedom to make love, play loud music, create art, wrestle naked, and raise confident kids that think.In criticizing the world were born into, its easy to point the finger at this or that politician or resign problems to circumstance. And with the perceived lack of power to concede the situation is unfixable and utterly broken. But if we want to know who to blame, we need only to look into a mirror. We support the situation. It is people, not rulers, who create the world of today.Some of us conclude that the situation is just a normal state of affairs, and simply human nature- as if there were one human nature! And, disregarding that, we all evolve and grow as people in different directions during our lives.Think of the values we are taught as children. How we are taught to behave as civic citizens. The phrases we are told by our parents, teachers and friends. The system is not just the state and corporations, it is a machine encompassing all spheres of life.You might hear for example:Respect for authority figures is a sign of maturity.Men with good jobs dress smart and respectably.Work hard for a good job and a good life. Retire young.Dont talk to strangers.Life is about money. Money makes the world go round.I was told all of these sentences in my life. That learning to accept authority is an inevitable part of growing up. That my character is defined by how I look, not how I act. That my single purpose is to be a work-slave. To avoid interaction with random unknowns outside my circle. And that responsibility starts and stops with myself.All of them are bad values.We are not born with these values. They are hard-wired into us from a young age. Luckily, knowledge feeds the unlearning process and the internet is an unlearning tool.Have you ever questioned the 15 years of our precious childhood from kindergarten to high school?  We attend a prison with fixed schedules and dinner at an allocated time. Were forced to wear uniforms. If you want to speak, you need to raise your hand. If you need the toilet, you must ask permission. And the lessons amount to little more than drilling information with the given promise of honours and qualifications.The reward for faithfully jumping through all these hoops for 15 years is a worthless piece of paper that isnt even required for a job at McDonalds. And the workers still need training. Our children arent taught how to cook a healthy meal, grow a garden or even a rudimentary concept of how to organise or lead groups of people without even a glimmer of understanding on how to resolve conflicts without violence. Or the principles of logic, and how to question an ideology. Kids are taught to sit at a desk and listen obediently as the world is packaged into neat boxes.School is little more than a training camp for salaried drones designed to format young minds for a life of subservience, too stupid to question the system itself or the authority of those running it. We are not born with bad values. They are wired into us from a young age.Lets talk about good values.Responsibility is about fulfilling your needs to have a dignified existence, and then expanding that circle to the people around you. To help bring up and out the potential of other free people so that together we thrive. Community and collective action is absolutely essential if we want to rise up. The system thrives by separating people into isolated pockets who get their information from TV and their culture from corporations. United together, we are stronger.Vires in numerisIndependence and autonomy is the ability to act. If we always need third parties and central organisations to resolve disputes, solve our problems and coordinate us then we are doomed as a species. Central authorities are always a magnet for corruption and that will never change. Learn to be self reliant and make things happen.Understanding is not an easy skill to develop, but it is very powerful. Being able to get into peoples minds, to listen and be able to meet their needs is leadership. A leader serves and inspires people into action, whereas a ruler uses coercion. For all their grandeur and force, rulers cannot harness the real potential of people. Nobody thinks under duress.We need assertive individuals who stand unyielding for what they believe in with directness of thought. If you know something is right, then fight for your vision. It will happen. The system feeds off passivity, and giving consent to its exclusive hold of force feeds the machine.Lastly lets approach the world as artists, and bring creativity to our work. The world is diverse, colourful and vibrant. Humans are not meant to live in little boxes and grey concrete jungles. Live art and be creative. Your work is art. Good art makes people think and feel.The role of good people is the vanguard of tomorrow.Its an old story. David vs Goliath. Starfleet rebels vs galactic deathstar. Anarchist revolutionaries vs the fascist empire. Both sides have existed for centuries and the struggle continues. However in recent decades with the unique political situation, the internet and a dawning awareness among people, the balance of power is shifting in our favour this time around.Humans can look to a future less dominated by the command hierarchies of the past, and more by thriving marketplaces of knowledge and merit.I remember an amateur blue webpage in the summer of 2010 describing a p2p currency that cannot be controlled by governments or central banks. Extremely skeptical, I dived into the code and discovered an idea which burnt itself in my memory. My mind latched onto Bitcoin. I realized this unknown project is the future of money.Bitcoin is a tool of resistance gifted to us by Satoshi. The idea has escaped and the idea of cryptocurrency will not be stopped. Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency will succeed.Bitcoin is about direct trade from peer to peer. The purest value transfer possible between 2 or more people. A direct and personal interaction over digital infrastructure. Welcome to the future of the black market. Real values, real people and uncorrupted markets.The internet is a tool of freedom and self-determination. Meddling in its mechanics is destructive. Whenever a website is blocked, a protocol is corrupted at some low level or undesirable traffic shaping occurs then seismic ripples of censorship and destruction lead to degradation of the network. The internet is fundamental to humanity, and must be protected at all costs.Bitcoin is no different, and must be kept pure.There are real risks to Bitcoin.The protocol is not a fixed, axiomatic system established by Satoshi. Its been constantly changing, rapidly evolving and the pace is accelerating. The risks are more subtle and probable than a government demanding changes to the fundamentals of Bitcoins protocol. The chilling effect of self censorship.We dont even need to touch the protocol.As Bitcoin grows, the inevitable specialization is kicking in. The blockchain is moving towards specialized services, and the future of full Bitcoin nodes is on the server, not personal computers. We have to wake up, adapt and work with the reality rather than persisting in self denial.If development is too centralized, with a small core infrastructure, then businesses will put real pressure to have features that destroy the integrity of the Bitcoin network. The excuse will be to protect themselves from liability. Self-censorship.And what they demand does not have to be protocol changes. They will demand features in the software they use. Software which remains compatible with the network, but works against the interests of individuals, small businesses and the black market.The possible malicious scenarios are endless. Stuff like p2p blacklists to create a legitimate walled garden, or tracking technologies like large databases of IP addresses to triangulate where transactions came from. At the other end of the spectrum, is putting development effort into diversifying the ecosystem to protect against censorship and proxy relay nodes, anonymizing mixers, small privacy tweaks and other technologies. Thats where developers who believe in Bitcoin should devote time to. Corporations are powerful enough. To developers: serve your community.A diversified Bitcoin of many wallets and implementations is a strong and pure Bitcoin. To protect the integrity of the network, we need to eliminate single points of failure. An inbred Bitcoin with the same software code everywhere shares the same weaknesses, and is susceptible to the same attacks. A single pathogen can wipe out a genetically homogenous population, and centralised software is vulnerable to the dictates of whoever controls development of that software code, and any dictates pressured onto them.The implications of a diversified Bitcoin is a Bitcoin difficult to control. It also sets the protocol in stone, as nobody has sole power over the standard. Consensus from many parties is the way forwards.The proper way to develop a standard is by having many different competing parties that require mutual interest and agreement to pass through changes. History is rife with abuse like when Internet Explorer dominated the browser market, and constantly broke the web standard by introducing proprietary extensions. Their motive was to swallow the market and lock users into Internet Explorer. The result was a broken web. A monopoly likes to dominate the market, shut out competitors and erect high barriers to entry.A diversified ecosystem protects against feature-creep or bloat of the standard. Extra features go beyond the basic function of Bitcoin and so can result in over-complication rather than simple design. Viewed over a longer time period, extra or unnecessary features seem to creep into the system beyond the initial goals and the small code of 15,000 lines set by Satoshi. The result will be a Bitcoin that becomes increasingly difficult to understand or implement without a huge initial investment of resources, time and people. No single person will fully understand Bitcoin anymore, and development monopolies will be further enforced.Linux is the most secure operating system because of its diversity. There is no single exploit that is universal across all versions of Linux. Bitcoin must evolve in the same way to become a resilient and tough system able to serve a global audience.A massive standard is difficult to re-implement. Satoshi Nakamoto gifted us a small, focused and pure Bitcoin.There is no need for compromise. Lets push for our complete vision. Bitcoin is here. We have the initiative and we make our stand now. We have the power and now is the time. Not later. Now.Within a century of the printing press being invented, wars, social strife and revolutions erupted across Europe. Old kings, revered religious leaders and tyrannical rulers were removed from power. People could now read what was being written in their bibles. Mass printing of the bible was subversive. And what was written in their bibles, is not what they were being fed. In the face of hard evidence, people dispelled old notions of what their religion was saying.Our economy will change. Bitcoin will rise as a fundamental technology. Seeking approval from the halls of Washington, and consent from the status quo is mere pandering as lapdogs at the feet of the system. Why would you willingly give your power away? Are you stupid?Some people make the argument that throwing Bitcoin under the bus and corrupting the core of this technology is needed to help businesses which specialize in the exchange of failing government fiat paper-money with Bitcoins. Are we willing to sacrifice the purity of this tool for a few short term gains that primarily benefit US corporations? Do they serve the need of Bitcoin?Others even go further, arguing we need the masses. That being a majority protects people from assaults. Typical herd mentality.And that regulation (and the measures to implement them) are a typical process of acceptance. I have news for you: majorities have been slaughtered like pigs all throughout history. Being pragmatic is code speak for obedience and cowardice.Bitcoin is the future. Act like you believe it. Act to prevent corruption of the system. Act to prevent Bitcoin becoming coopted in any way. We must preserve the principles of Satoshi Nakamoto.We have the initiative and the power. You know the truth of the world. Stop supporting your own enemies. We dont need them. They need us. You are the one empowering them. Withdraw your consent. Withdraw your support. Dont accept their terms or try to win a game where they set the rules. Dont try to win your rulers favour. Dont bother to beg for welfare or good treatment. Worst of all, dont help them hunt down your neighbour.Time we stick our flag in the ground, and make our stand.One day master told slave: Do this small thing and everything is fine. Keep up the good work.. The slave was happy because not much was asked so he started to create something cool. The master walked in a week later, and said do this as well. The slave was shocked. But master, we had an agreement, you said I only needed to do this?. Master responded I changed my mind. You need to do this as well.. The slave reluctantly agreed. At least it wasnt that bad.Over time, the master more and more increased his demands on the slave. By now the slave had created something totally wonderful and was dependent on it, but the master controlled his work and owned him.The road is long, and real work is needed. Less talk, more action. There are too few people in this world working on worthwhile things for the people. But even though the work-load is immense and daunting, there are concrete steps to achieve the global objective.Truth happens. We will succeed. Dont wait around for others to take action. We must dive head first without regard for consequences, and break the inertia of passivity. When enough people do this, the real change will occur.Fight for what you believe in. If you believe, and uphold a truth, then all your energy should be devoted to your objectives. Anytime you are accepting compromise, you are acting against your objective. None of us are pure. We are flawed and imperfect. But as good people we must strive for uncomplicated directness in our actions. Our actions must be transparent in motive and pure in reasoning.The power is within us. It always has been. Imagine if an NSA agent purchases this and injects their own javascript. What does he want that 2.5 BTC for anyway? Tip: make it easier to add ratings. When I click a person's profile, I expect a button to add feedback if it's a trading partner or a friend. BitMit is the best Bitcoin market and a super good site for goods. No iolites? genjix, i want to play! Your bitcoind blockchain is behind. Interesting why that transaction took so long. Were you using blockchain.info's wallet? It's bullshit FUD. I wouldn't listen to any of that claptrap. Bitcoin will never progress if we don't have competition. Are you still using the original browser by Tim Berners Lee? Bitcoin is ~15k lines of code by a single person. Competent programmers everywhere deal with millions of lines of code. Enjoying the screenshots. Shaping up really nice! Keep pushing the envelope. They play in physical brick & mortar locations. As long as we keep paying lip service to fools, we will not own our own minds. Bitcoin is a natural invention and will win out. The internet will prevail over power structures too. The printing press did, overturning old hierarchies and overcoming their challenges to truth. It's not a good idea to compromise on your values because you want to win some short time favour or platitudes from a bully. It doesn't work and only emboldens the state from easy successes in gaining compliance. That's the bigger threat to Bitcoin: compromising on its revolutionary qualities. They will keep asking for more and more, and it will impede the rest of Bitcoin. We need more dayjobs in privacy not tracking. Are mining pools illegal? What? Who's going to help you survive without the daddy state to look after you? Lemme guess, you're going to run for the hills with your dog and your shotgun. Yeah cool but we all know he meant randomly. OP, only if the 2 people also spent Bitcoins from that address and put different public keys in their inputs. Then we'd hash them to the same address, be like holy fuck, just accept fate and then forget the incident as an oddity. Generating the same public key by chance: no way unless the alg (as dree said) sucks.

You can't imprison an idea. Long live the Silk Road. Yes, but it's different if you just want the money to buy a yacht vs if you want the money to pay off some drug lord to protect your wife and kids from harm. 8000 random lives imprisoned or keeping your family alive. We all make stupid mistakes (drug debts), and do bad things not motivated by greed (motivated by loved ones). It's easy saying what you would've done if you were in his position after the fact.What are you actually doing? The guy was threatening to release the info for 8000 people. Those people would have had their lives ruined by LE. If I was at risk of 10+ years in jail for a victimless crime because of the deliberate actions of an asshole motivated by money, then I would not mind someone assassinating that person.But it's not so morally easy since the guy had kids, and drug debts. But he was blackmailing with the threat of many people's lives at stake. I have no job and no money. It's not about your living condition. It's about doing work, being competent and having vision. I'll message you via email and we'll sort this out. Barcelona: http://unsystem.net/incubator/ This app has a lot of potential. Definitely watching this. Good luck. yep it uses obelisk. more info: http://libbitcoin.dyne.org/obelisk/obelisk (and sx) aren't released yet.I believe your error is because the worker you start for the server hasn't got a blockchain database setup. The other crash is because I was making changes today but it should be fixed now.I had a server for people to use, but it got copyright takedowns so now we're searching for a new one. People keep asking about a PoS system. All the proposals involve the users having expensive mobile phones or some kind of specialised electronic equipment. This does not help normal people, people without phones or the developing world.I hacked this up for a bar inside a social centre in Milan ( http://www.macao.mi.it/ ):https://github.com/genjix/macaoExplanation:User has 2 QR codes. Imagine having 2 credit cards with a QR code on them and a swivel hinge on them. The QR code on the top card is your public unencrypted receiving address. Your rotate the card, and the one inside is your private encrypted sending wallet seed (used to create your private key).The bar then has a terminal with the software running (check the subdir called 'wallet'). You scan your private QR code, enter your password and are presented with a menu:Amount: [_____________0.00_]* Pay to bar* Pay to QR code* Enter Bitcoin addressYou can type how much you want to send, then click pay to bar. Or you can scan someone else's public QR code.This is inexpensive and easy way to get people into Bitcoin without requiring any technology on their part. You can issue accounts for people and print them out then and there on the spot. People can send to other people, and mobile phones can send to their public QR code. To make payments, they use the terminal. Or they can go home / on a phone and enter the seed there and continue using the wallet.Simple PoS system, inexpensive, easy, low-cost, ...Spread the knowledge around. Hopefully someone can take this idea and make it into a cool project that lots of people will use. libbitcoin now has a blockchain reorg testing tool!https://github.com/spesmilo/libbitcoin/tree/master/test/fakechainRun the bash script run.shYou can customise the test by editing step.hppYou can test anything by customising step.hpp. The default test now tries to create 3 chains, handle reorganisations, double spending, spending transactions from alternate branches and duplicate transactions.$ cd libbitcoin/tests/fakechain/$ ./run.sh$ ../../examples/display-lastIt works by mining the blocks from the genesis block. It submits a chain of 100 blocks then does the reorg test on top. This is because you cannot spend coinbase transactions that are less than COINBASE_MATURITY (100 blocks). history/balance/wallet commands:My host is unreachable for a bit: http://wiki.hetzner.de/index.php/Netzwerkkonfiguration_wegen_Switchanpassung/enOnce my server is available, everything should be working again. My host is unreachable for a bit: http://wiki.hetzner.de/index.php/Netzwerkkonfiguration_wegen_Switchanpassung/enOnce my server is available, everything should be working again. It uses libbitcoin with a blockchain query infrastructure called Obelisk:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30646.0https://github.com/spesmilo/obelisk/The cc- commands are encryption commands in all common Linux repos (apt-get install ccencrypt). Be grateful they are doing this free service to the community. You know that's not true. libbitcoin was a full implementation since 2011. You were also claiming in another topic that I'm not a Bitcoin developer. Hey,My email is amir@unsystem.net if you ever want to reach me directly with questions.I've been making changes recently, so my server might sometimes experience downtime. Obelisk and SX aren't released yet but a release will be happening soon. Then we will create a stable production server, and keep a separate one for development.If you want to create your own:$ mkdir blockchain$ sx initchain blockchain/INFO: Imported genesis block 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26fYou now have a blockchain with the genesis block.If you start the worker, it will begin downloading the blockchain. The rsync tool is obselete. We're working on a tool to bootstrap the Bitcoin blockchain but it is experimental:https://github.com/spesmilo/libbitcoin/tree/master/toolsSo you'll be able to use rtorrent to download it from bittorrent, then import it into libbitcoin (Obelisk).The blockchain path is in /etc/obelisk/worker.cfgThat compile error is with ZeroMQ, and should be fixed by them. Since the problem doesn't occur in Debian Wheezy or Ubuntu 13.04, it's probably fixed.Thanks! This is a wallet. libbitcoin is the client and can do any Bitcoin thing you want really because it has a powerful API: http://libbitcoin.dyne.org
Thanks for your prescient answers. I support your viewpoints. libbitcoin is the first full reimplementation of the Bitcoin standard. It was started May 2011 by me and Patrick Strateman.BitsOfProof and btcd are new entries into the space in the last few months, but there was nothing before.This wallet is the first wallet (software you can use to do Bitcoin stuff, manages your keys in a wallet, creates transactions and has an interface) based off a full reimplementation. Other wallets either depended on bitcoind or were partial nodes. meanig gives a good explanation. The situation is deep, and the land is ours. It's been stolen by rulers and corruption. And then people work for a corrupt system that abuses, controls and limits them paying rent every month for a small box. But OK, if they want us to play this stupid economic game, we will just build our own markets, out-compete them and buy back the planet.Empty property is everywhere in London. We occupied empty houses of the queen in January, and the police response was massive but we did a 9 hour resistance on the roof. The police would never react that way if your private property is occupied. The big response is for her majesty.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2257490/Riot-police-evict-squatters-exclusive-central-London-house-hold-rooftop-protest.htmlIn the G8, they sent 1000 police to arrest everybody protesting. I find it ironic that the G8 magazine had an article called "Protecting Digital Economies" talking about Bitcoin with such golden quotes like:"alternative payment mechanisms, suchas Bitcoin and a host of others, can enablecriminal and terrorist groups to laundermoney and fund their operations.""Governments of the world have the abilityright now to ban these payment mechanisms.""If treasuries and financial institutionsaround the world were to block thosetransactions and permit only legitimatecurrencies to be used on the internet throughregulated payment service providers andcards (such as Visa, MasterCard and AmericanExpress), then the flow of many billions ofdollars to criminal groups would be stemmed.""bring about a more safe and secureinternet environment for all citizens.If the leaders of the European Union andUnited States could be convinced to take alead on these initiatives, that would be a hugecontribution to making the internet a safeplace for financial transactions. At the sametime, it would also strike a blow against thosewho would try to destroy the fabric of our theworlds well-being."I love the last sentence. Quick, the sleepwalking zombies are waking up! Please stop this nonsense. I have given my heart and soul to Bitcoin for 3 years, opensource for 10+ years and profited nothing. I have 4 BTC and no other money. I have received no money from any of these rich & popular Bitcoin people. I am supported by good people who have not much themselves and don't really understand Bitcoin, but believe in me and what I value.But I love Bitcoin, and am here forever. I promised myself this in summer 2010, and nothing has changed. Hi Trace,1. Should copyright exist?2. How better can we allocate money/resources in the Bitcoin space?3. Why do you support a central foundation?4. Is Bitcoin guaranteed to happen (like internet or printing press)?5. What do you think of Cody Wilson?Thanks. Lovely nice peaceful people. Hey,We're just working on a tool to convert the bitcoind bootstrap.dat into a libbitcoin blockchain which would make the transition easier.For now I would look at the config in /etc/obelisk/. You want the port of the frontend in balancer.cfg for your sx.cfgCommands to run:# Initialize blockchain$ mkdir blockchain$ sx initchain blockchain/# Run the load balancer$ obbalancer# Run a worker$ obworkerYou can view debug.log and error.log to see the output of the worker.It's important that everyone setup an Obelisk server though. I will make a proper release though soon, and then it will include instructions and I'll be ready for everyone to run versions. Soon soon. This is the only email I have from you:My email: amir@unsystem.netI am a squatter and anarchist. I'm not your yuppie making toy apps. I build tools for the people. If I don't conform to your vision of how Bitcoin should look like, then that's your problem. I have been approached by UK cyber-crimes police multiple times to work for them. This is the first time we have a completely independent and full Bitcoin software stack.Before we had clients like Electrum using bitcoind as a backend, or MultiBit which do full block validation (they assume a transaction is trusted once it gets deep in the blockchain).https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=291576It doesn't look much yet. Still terminal based, but adding the GUI is easy. And it's an experimental prototype.It's the pre-alpha proof of concept.To protect the integrity of the network with no single point of failure, it's vital to diversify the software development process.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Microsoft_antitrust_caseA standard controlled & set by a single party is disastrous for a neutral Bitcoin.

Location changed because I changed my mind. I couldn't in my right mind justify such a wasteful expenditure unless it's bringing something valuable to the people. Instead I want to invest it locally and build something subtle and powerful with soul. I want to do something far better.

Just for the proof of concept this is the way that works now for us to keep testing and developing. We welcome all security auditing and will refactor the code to make security more explicit.Please keep analizing the code and providing feedback, its really appreciated!.Cheers!
You're right, added COPYRIGHT notice, made it AGPL for now, since this is proof of concept we will think about a more permissive license but we're comfortable with AGPL to encourage a more open ecosystem. Yes we should develop some naming and versioning of different protocols that emerge so different clients and tools can all communicate. We can develop several protocols for finding peers and jointly creating multisig transactions for different goals.The protocols can then easily integrated into mainline clients (the one we implemented can easily be included in other clients, just uses POST, GET and some json to pass around the input, outputs, tx and signatures).Cheers! New "release" of CoinJoin, features: * Server now has a public "lobby" to serve as meeting point (front page announcing "open" coinjoins) * Creator of coinjoin can choose amount, so its no longer just 0.01, now you can join arbitrary amounts * The client can now resume the session in different runs, so you can actually run it in several times to finish the coinjoin and wait for other ppl joining (you had to keep it open before).You can check the video at (shows using the tool and lobby): * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr6DeziHdFsTest server still at: * http://7vxb75tbnszhy2go.onionWe keep working on the implementation and more features so donations welcome at: 1H1LP8UhGR5wK9WppBMwewCddwdebYqwwT(some ideas: serverless setup, casual use for joining tx and fees...).

Server:Powerless: has no real power. It's just a meeting point for participants to exchange data.Uninformed: has no special information except that which is public (and goes on the blockchain). There's no mapping between inputs and outputs because clients add their data in successive stages.Controls nothing: holds no funds. Funds and private keys are stored client side. Signing is done client side.Tor service. You can take down hidden services, but Silk Road and all the other services are still running around since 2+ years. Code is opensource so you can setup your own services. Users just paste the URL into the software. It's not really centralised. An analogy: BitcoinSpinner uses the BitcoinSpinner server, but in Electrum you choose your server and can setup your own.Extensible. Adding the p2p mechanism for exchanging data can easily be done. Replace the ServerInterface class methods in client.py with your own: https://github.com/calafou/coinjoin/blob/master/client.py Then the URL in the software becomes a shared secret. We designed the software with this in mind.More technical info: http://sx.dyne.org/anontxWe've delivered usable software, simple for grandma (money goes in, money goes out), requires no blockchain or bitcoind, easy to install and trustless. We followed gmaxwell's instructions as our guidepoint and went further. And we delivered the product fast.You have the code. Setup your own server. It's all opensource.note: Our implementation of the server is in stages and does not know the mapping so it's better even.note: we do a 4 step process where the outputs and inputs are loaded separately, so the server doesn't know the mapping between them Hi,I am claiming the bounty.More info: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=282086Source code: https://github.com/calafou/coinjoin PROOF OF CONCEPT ONLYhttp://sx.dyne.org/anontx/-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1My address: 1H1LP8UhGR5wK9WppBMwewCddwdebYqwwT-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (GNU/Linux)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o2J/-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----https://unsystem.net/static/genjix.gpg.txtCheck out my video about Bitcoin http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzgY8taGyB0 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br6j1D1xXvw g++ 4.7 or higher as always.

Big thanks to Santiago Mendez who put in the time to help me improve the tools offering valuable feedback. The original: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50721.0 Created a nice cheatsheet. Yeah the point is that the installer should put them in a non-default location with a prefix like sx.newkey and then a bash script provides the wrapper on top together with the help and everything. No, they are Electrum compatible. BIP-32 wallets will happen once Electrum and other clients start using them, and I have an implementation to follow and understand how to design a nice API for libbitcoin.

I already have some cool possibilities.On the backend, I have a load balancer with several workers (full Bitcoin nodes) that you can make blockchain queries against for scalability and redundancy, and subscribe to new confirmed blocks and validated unconfirmed transactions. It's all asynchronous.https://github.com/genjix/obeliskI want to make a lite non-persistent wallet, some building blocks, Linux admin tools, secure backend for website balances.For managing keys, I have a toolset for Linux where you can do stuff likeoffline transactions for safely managing Bitcoins in cold storage with atrained admin.Here's an example of the fullnode (300 LOC) in C++, Python (bindings) and C (wrapper).http://libbitcoin.dyne.org/doc/examples/fullnode.html#examples-fullnodehttps://gitorious.org/libbitcoin-bindings/libbitcoin-bindings/blobs/master/tests/fullnode.pyhttps://github.com/genjix/libbitcoin-c-wrapper/blob/master/examples/fullnode.cMy email is on my website:http://libbitcoin.dyne.org/ I don't earn enough to pay taxes. I can't drive (live in europe). I skip food (see http://trashwiki.org/en/Main_Page ). Hospital is free here. I squat and don't pay rent. Plenty of other options for living too.Many people are living off Bitcoins now. It's quite common Not all forum members have enough posts to be able to PM the OP. Consider adding an additional contact method for those people. mtgox, bitpay, coinlab, bitinstant = money transmitter companies = bitcoin foundation I see what you're saying but it does feel a bit depressing if the unscrupulous keep exploiting people and do well off it. I'm hoping Bitcoin will empower more people. Most people are good. Don't be so harsh on him. Stephen Foley (the author) is an old guy that doesn't like Bitcoin.

Hey Estonians, I'm doing a lecture this week in Kaunas, Lithuania: https://www.facebook.com/events/589384777760219/?ref=notif&notif_t=plan_user_joined Hey, if anyone is nearby to Kaunas, Lithuania this week, I'll do a lecture there:https://www.facebook.com/events/589384777760219/?ref=notif&notif_t=plan_user_joinedLet me know if you want to speak also about Bitcoin. Hey, I'll do an event here this week:https://www.facebook.com/events/589384777760219/?ref=notif&notif_t=plan_user_joinedIf anyone will come along we can add you as a speaker too. Would be good to have some locals speaking too. http://libbitcoin.dyne.org/doc/crypto.html#deterministic-walletsPython bindings too (see main page). I think the Raspberry Pi uses the ARM processor. If you manage to get libbitcoin compiled and running on there, I'll happily add you a remove(tx_hash) method.SQL is too slow when validating the blocks. Loading the entire blockchain into SQL will take a very long time. However there's a ready made schema there for you if you like.libbitcoin uses a blockchain interface with different backends. As long as you implement the interface, you should be fine. If you're not too worried about validating blocks, then it should be quite easy (a week(end) of work).I should comment that part. There's lots of comments in the API, but less so in the deeper parts of the internal machinery. I will get around to that.You need to close the database handle before writing to it from an external context. That's dangerous otherwise. There should be a single environment open with LevelDB, and you don't want other async writes to conflict while you're doing stuff to the DB.Finding unspent outputs means doing a linear scan through every output and seeing which ones do not have a corresponding spend entry. The comments for what the tables (called databases in LevelDB) do is in leveldb_blockchain.hpp Yeah you can do that if you rebuild the database. That means creating a new database (see examples/initchain.cpp), then importing the old blocks into the new one. However block headers are only 80 bytes so you should keep those. In Bitcoin, this is what pruning outputs means (libbitcoin by default doesn't do that). I personally believe that disk space is not a big deal (current unmodified chain is 15 Gb). I'm more worried about fetch speed (not writes) and scalability.I had a PostgreSQL database in the beginning (hence the bitcoin.sql file in the repo) but eventually moved to bdb. The postgres backend became unmaintained, the API changed a lot and it fell out of development before I dropped it entirely. SQL is too slow for blockchains.There is a method to delete from the blockchain directly, but I haven't exposed that. It's used for blockchain reorgs. You can use that same code, but make sure you stop the blockchain object before modifying the database. You can then reopen it after:Code:leveldb_blockchain* chain = new leveldb_blockchain(pool);chain->start(dbpath, blockchain_started);// ... do stuff// stop/join threadpools using the blockchain.chain->stop();delete chain;// open database, delete whatever you want.leveldb_blockchain* chain = new leveldb_blockchain(pool);chain->start(dbpath, blockchain_started);// continue from where you left off...something like that.see the method called "end_slice"https://github.com/spesmilo/libbitcoin/blob/master/src/blockchain/leveldb/leveldb_chain_keeper.cppIt's deleting a bunch of blocks from the end of the blockchain.Also `bool leveldb_chain_keeper::clear_transaction_data(leveldb_transaction_batch& batch, const transaction_type& remove_tx)' (same file) might interest you too. It's deleting specific transactions from the database. fullnode example using the python bindings:https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin-bindings/libbitcoin-bindings/blobs/master/tests/fullnode.pyalso if you expose libbitcoin through an RPC interface like Apache Thrift, and publish new confirmed blocks and new validated unconfirmed txs using ZeroMQ, then you get a nice piece of server middleware:https://github.com/genjix/qlayer/tree/master/srcI've made this before in C++: https://github.com/genjix/query but I think it'd better be served being done in Python.Also if you have an bunch of dumb slaves with their own blockchain, and they just synchronise with the master (see https://github.com/genjix/slave ) then it's a really fast way to serve the blockchain to tons of people. Since everything runs in its own process too, it's resilient and stable (parts can go offline and everything still functions). On the front you have a load balancer selecting which slave to distribute requests to.We are porting this to a Python libbitcoin and Twisted (or maybe gevent) architecture.

You broadcast it to the network. To verify it was sent, you might listen to see if nodes respond back with an inventory and if not resend the transaction within a certain time. Then to release the funds, you'd all need to sign a transaction according to its rules. We now have experimental Python bindings thanks to Pablo Martin (caedes)!https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin-bindings/libbitcoin-bindingsType "make compile" to compile them.Full node example:https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin-bindings/libbitcoin-bindings/blobs/master/tests/fullnode.py Correct.Also you need to run:$ ./initchain database/to initialize the blockchain.Also if you want to full blockchain then it's available at: http://46.4.92.107/database.tar.bz2 He thinks he can do more good for the world by staying in the party. Maybe he has too much to lose and is willing to compromise over that. I'm in Kaunas: amir@unsystem.net I'll help out with this. Give me an email: amir@unsystem.net - send me a proposal for your thoughts and ideas.My project: http://libbitcoin.dyne.org - I also did lots of work on Electrum, reworked the server and designed the lite GUI: http://electrum.org/media/litegui2.png This post is by Donald. This whole thing caused him a lot of stress and paranoia. Give me a shout. I'm in London: amir@unsystem.net Squatting is not illegal in the UK. Squatting commercial properties is fine. It's the police that are breaking the law. I've seen them do it many times against other people with no recourse against them.And no, I won't stop talking about Bitcoin or my views to anyone who asks. Otherwise Bitcoin will become co-opted. The personal computer revolution of the 70s was hijacked in a similar way. The people who built the early technology failed to speak up, and the movement became co-opted by corporations. I could maybe buy the argument we should play it safe when Bitcoin was small, but not anymore. Everyone knows it exists. The highest echelons of government are inviting us to give presentations about Bitcoin to them (see http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/42ca6762-bbfc-11e2-82df-00144feab7de.html#axzz2TGGzzaez ). Now is the time to push our message loudly. Bitcoin is a revolution in finance that undermines the whole industry. We are not aiming to make banking more efficient - we want to get rid of them. If you want to lie or say anything opposite then you are already co-opted and working against Bitcoin. Don't end the FED, bypass the FED. Real change comes from bottom up.If you're trying to convince people, then you won't do that by dressing the same as every other banker on TV and saying Bitcoin is this new safe payments option. You have to be true to yourself. To speak with passion about things you feel, and tell people how it actually is. I don't buy this talk of hiding your true thoughts and feelings. Maybe you lose some votes, but you also gain the trust of the true people out there who are able to see you are a real person speaking truth, not a diplomat in a suit. I get emails from people reaching out to me from the darkness, and thanking me for my appearances. People see I'm carrying a message from the heart.When I met Birgitta Jonsdottir (Icelandic politician), she was totally messy with torn clothes. I asked her doesn't she need to put on a show and dress nicely to win votes. She told me that's absolute rubbish. Real support is created by being open as a person, and not hiding who you are. And she has strong support globally because she's such a cool person that people trust her. She talks about things personal to herself. It comes from her heart.That's my aim with unSYSTEM: http://unsystem.net - I want to make a conference which shows Bitcoin as cultural movement. Not a conference which is giving facts and info, but something which people feel and intuitively understand.Nothing will slow Bitcoin's adoption now. It will grow regardless of what people say. The technology is so strong that it will win out by itself. If not Bitcoin, then another cryptocurrency. The idea is here to stay. What is dangerous is how it will grow. If Bitcoin grows completely in white market, becomes totally regulated and everything then we lose any power that we gained with Bitcoin. We have to stress and force its growth in the right direction otherwise the movement will become hijacked and amount to nothing useful whatsoever.You know sometimes I go to these hackerspaces, and I see people working with technology, electronics, programming, industry, ... and I see powerful guys which can topple states or delete entire industries. Instead they waste their skill making pointless toys like moving cat ears. I want nothing to do with them. They are a waste of space and total zombies. You have such a big power and then use it to make toys instead of tools for people. The reason we have the internet now, and the reason it's so great is because the guys who made the internet imbued it with their ethics and morals. The internet could've turned out very differently. Instead we have an amazing world-changing tool for humanity. We have co-opted mercenary programmers making proprietary crap that goes into a corporate blackholes. They rationalise destruction of the world as saying they need to pay bills to look after their kids and wife. And loads of zombies do the same helping empower states and overly powerful corporations to oppress people. They're idiots, and if you have this amazing skill then you should be carrying the torch of the same scientists and technologists before you who created all this wealth for everyone. What are you doing with your life otherwise? Making money and getting along? Come on. Waste of space.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Memory Lots of new things coming. I'm at a basic milestone where I'm content with the overall internal architecture of the library now.https://github.com/spesmilo/libbitcoin/commits/masterNext steps is Python bindings, and a blockchain query API. The Python bindings were done before but were experimental. We had some issues with asynchronous calls and the GIL. I'm thinking to simply turn all async calls into sync blocking ones for Python anyway (keep it simple).The query layer is something really nice:https://github.com/genjix/query-layer(see the tutorial.py)You can move around and examine it using logical Python constructs. I want to expand upon this and also give access to new blocks and verified transactions in the memory pool. Then create an Electrum server protocol implementation chained to this.Also subvertx (command line tools for Bitcoin using libbitcoin) is a bit out of date and not actively developed. I would like to take that to something serious too but it needs time (if someone wants to volunteer, this is a cool project) to firstly create how the tools should look and then implement them. I can help someone with that if they know C++.https://github.com/genjix/subvertxhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50721.0Finally I'm working on an Android wallet. It's not using libbitcoin currently, but eventually that will be needed in the future.There's some other various small tools I've made too. One is a fast-monitor tool which sits in the Bitcoin network and looks at transaction outputs in new blocks and unconfirmed transactions for an address so it can tell a website of a new deposit. The tool doesn't validate the new blocks or transactions and is only meant to be a lightweight thing. I don't see it having too many uses except where a website has TONS of Bitcoin addresses and can't afford to poll the balance for all of them or something. BTW, I understand what some of you are going through. My father is nearly 70, and just lost all his money to property investments that never got built. The person responsible took lots of money from many people and ran away. He has nothing left anymore and cannot pay his mortgage on his home. He worked hard his whole life, and now is bust at an age where he cannot work. Now he wants to run off to a small remaining plot of land he has in Iran in some village and live out the rest of his days. He never had a boss and installed a hard work ethic in me and honest morals. We hadn't been speaking for many years before this because he never understood what I was about (why I preferred to write opensource for free instead of make money and get a degree). My explanation is to read my full post instead of taking snippets out of context.
I was on these forums all day long everyday during the entire time while nobody else said anything except the odd post from Zhou and a couple from Tihan. The only thing I did have is ability to vet claims and ask people what's happening.Check my posting history:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1931;sa=showPosts;start=100 I've gotten a lot of hate from people who've blamed me for Bitcoinica, convinced I'm to blame. Maybe now you'll all understand. Here's some basic facts.Coinlab were the investors behind Bitcoinica. Tihan Seale and Peter Vessenes founded Coinlab together. Tihan bought Bitcoinica and Coinlab was involved from the beginning. Patrick Murck filed the legal papers on behalf of Bitcoinica investors.We were given fake shares in a fake company. The deal was to contract us to work on Bitcoinica. The site had been losing money for months and had huge security problems. A new company was formed to handle that agreement.After the first compromise, despite huge problems in the setup and design of the website, they wanted to put it back up as fast as possible. I was against this strongly which is why I released the code. After an employee used this as an excuse to steal more funds (the evidence is definitive), they were upset more over the loss of the 'Intellectual Property'.They scapegoated me. They wanted no liability and refused to help us complete the job for them. All the emails are public on this forum (I released them) as proof. Donald kept asking to speak to their superior but they refused.I never had access to money or any servers. I was a programmer working on the hedging algorithm.They are sneaky, and play dirty tactics. Tihan is a manipulative sociopath.We had run Intersango, the biggest UK exchange for 2 years without any problems doing 2 million GBP turnover annually. The site has been closed down (due to UK bank problems) paying everyone back and we experienced no security flaws during its history. I had no reason to deliberately cause Bitcoinica users any harm, and if you actually go and study the evidence on the forums, you'll see I acted in all of your best interests.When everyone ran off, a programmer was told he was now acting CEO of a defunct company that never was formed and had to make executive decisions despite having no technical control or access to anything. Do you know how fucking absurd this is? Then to be told by many different parties conflicting things to sign for their personal interest and get blamed for that.These are facts, and every point can be proven. I don't want mining to be controlled by a cartel, but it might be the kind of industry which naturally tends towards that state because of economies of scale. The Ripple concept essentially depends on this concept more than Bitcoin does, and if it's a problem with Bitcoin then it'll be a huge problem with Ripple.https://ripple.com/wiki/ConsensusI'm not proposing any change. I'm asking what will happen in the future. http://greenwire.us/articles/it-security/cryptocurrency/dr-bitcoin-e02-the-unproven-hypothesis/Andrew puts forwards the argument about if the Bitcoin network ends up being rationally driven rather than the altruistic p2p model, then you could reach a point where some nodes start fucking over other nodes for self profit. If the incentives model is not correctly designed, Bitcoin could implode and that this is more of a risk than the 51% attack.This reminds me of the Hawk and Dove model in evolutionary biology:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_%28game%29#Hawk-DoveBitcoin might have a possible built in solution. When Hawk and Dove models is used to simulate an ecological population, you often get a stabilising point. If you take a population of Doves and a few Hawks invade, then the invader species will have a big initial advantage. But after some time of swinging the population will swing less and settle on a proportion. This is called an Evolutionary Stable Strategy.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategyIn the podcast, they use the example of miners on the blockchain. If a block contains a huge transaction fee of like 1000 BTC, then rational self interested miners will fight over the block and the blockchain will never have a chance to progress. It may be then that the best strategy is actually taking only a small slice and paying the rest to everybody else (pay off the hoard), so that others will build off your block instead of fighting for it.When two valid blocks are created at the same time, they are in a race. They compete to have the next block built off them. Part of the problem is that miners build a new block before they discover the newly built block. This leads to a forking of the blockchain with the newly built block rejected.Lets start by thinking how to solve this problem.Ideally you'd want miners to discover new blocks before they create their own blocks. This step can be helped by clearing specialised paths between miners of high connectivity. The only use case for these paths is the rapid pulsing of new blocks throughout the network of miners (broadcasting).Cutthroat efficiency is the key focus. Rapid deliverance of blocks to the targets (other miners) at low cost. The network's sole traffic is one node telling every other node about new blocks. Based on cost and topology, it's then conceivable to imagine hubs emerging. As the hubs grow, they condense outwards forming a backbone. We've seen this behaviour in other large scale networks with high traffic requirements like the internet. Attached nodes to this backbone are then given broadcast prioritisation based on how much they pay.Our hypothetical miner loses 1% of mined blocks per month because they become orphaned. He calculates his average monthly loss to be $100. Then a broadcast service offers to cut his 1% to 0.1% for $20 per month. The miner now experiences a monthly loss of $10 + the $20 for the service. He has gained $70.It doesn't matter what the actual numbers are. As the market expands, there will be a tipping point where the loss in expectation for a miner overcomes the cost of this service. As that industry grows and the services have to expand to meet capacity, then we see the gradual emergence of a backbone amongst miners.When competing blocks are created, miners want other miners to accept and build off them. They might start paying other miners to accept their blocks. In effect saying build off my block and I'll give you a share of the reward, with a tit-for-tat relationship built up. Miners then must evaluate the likelihood of blocks becoming orphaned versus what share of the reward they will get from that block.Since time is crucial, established agreements would become normal to codify this behaviour. You don't want to lose time negotiating. This behaviour becomes paying miners to prioritise your blocks in general. It's conceivable that a whole industry will arise of companies evaluating and scoring the mining capacity of various mining operations.This has economic effects and could flatten the reward structure while decreasing variance among large scale operations. Mining could be a natural monopoly whereby miners experience increasing rates of return per unit as they scale their operations upwards. A simple example is the complex cooling arrangements increasing employed by mining farms. Custom setups or infrastructure might offer a far better return than small scale operations.Against this backdrop, it's not hard to imagine a gentlemen's club forming. Everyone involved in that industry knows one another, and they have their own set of unwritten rules and agreements. The internet is like this.This private club creates mutual infrastructure to improve their operations and establishes a backbone. Access to the backbone is prioritised either based on available mining capacity or how much you pay. There would need to be a mechanism for newly mined blocks to escape this backbone to the wider Bitcoin world. I imagine a second tier caching blocks and feeding them outwards on a slower network.I don't want mining to be controlled by a cartel, but it might be the kind of industry which naturally tends towards that state because of economies of scale. The Ripple concept essentially depends on this concept more than Bitcoin does, and if it's a problem with Bitcoin then it'll be a huge problem with Ripple.https://ripple.com/wiki/ConsensusI'm not proposing any change. I'm asking what will happen in the future. Great guy. Gave me a discount without asking even. At the moment I'm working on blockchain stuff. You can see the commit log to check my progress:https://github.com/spesmilo/libbitcoin/commits/masterMainly I'm concerned with blockchain interface servers right now:https://github.com/genjix/query-layer rKEZyQBqrLD3fgBKCaEa7eKHGxCT3fXj7Q Haven't been able to develop Electrum during last 2 weeks. I'm the main organiser of the Bitcoin conference and it's taking up all of my waking hours.Once it's over, I plan to get back onto finishing the next release of Electrum. I'll definitely be investigating this. Could you send me an email next Tuesday to genjix@riseup.net? (Don't send it now otherwise it will get lost - I'm getting dozens of emails) Haven't been able to develop Electrum during last 2 weeks. I'm the main organiser of the Bitcoin conference and it's taking up all of my waking hours.Once it's over, I plan to get back onto finishing the next release of Electrum. Fixed! Also we can now change the server from inside the lite GUI. The Reddit was cool!Also this is nice: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=103162.0;topicseenBTW I think people should not be using github master if they want security and stability. Only use the releases. We need to change those PIP install instructions. I also need to setup an environment to test installations.But this conference is exhausting and taking all my time. I really cannot wait until it finishes because it is super stressful. I keep hoping for it to end. Once it finishes, I'm going on a sabbatical for a few weeks where I only write code. No emails. lol i love how you're all collaborating to design Electrum a better logo. we should definitely use a logo made by the community. if tuxavant or anyone else wants to organise that, that would be awesome. the concept or history behind it would be very cool and fitting for Electrum. I put it back. Didn't realise no face would get so much hate.Anyone curious about the reason:http://spiritedaway.wikia.com/wiki/No-Face_%28Kaonashi%29As a lonely creature who seeks attention from Chihiro after having developed an obsession for her kind heart, No-Face first appeared a very timid and soft-spoken spirit whose vocabulary consisted of grunts and moans as opposed to understandable words. Not knowing much about The Bathhouse or about other spirits in general, No-Face learned by example. Exposed to the crooked thoughts and greed of the workers, he quickly grew to encompass their personalities, hoping that his endeavor to be like those around Chihiro would eventually garner her affection for him, but ultimately bringing about the opposite effect. ...With his assumed large amount of wealth No-Face became a sensation with the workers who constantly begged for tips from him. After witnessing Chihiro reject his offering of gold, No-Face sadly drops the gold onto the ground, forcing greedy workers to fight for a piece. Angered in assuming that a worker insulted him, No-Face swallows two more people as his true face is revealed to the fearful workers.  I added selectable themes to Electrum.To add a new theme, simply create a new directory in the electrum data directory (either ./data or your system wide local data).Inside your directory create a file called name.cfg with the name of that theme.Create another file called style.css - this will be your CSS for the theme (see other themes for reference).Documentation on Qt's stylesheets (used by Electrum):Overview: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/stylesheet.htmlExamples: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/stylesheet-examples.htmlReference manual: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/stylesheet-reference.html I added selectable themes to Electrum.To add a new theme, simply create a new directory in the electrum data directory (either ./data or your system wide local data).Inside your directory create a file called name.cfg with the name of that theme.Create another file called style.css - this will be your CSS for the theme (see other themes for reference).Documentation on Qt's stylesheets (used by Electrum):Overview: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/stylesheet.htmlExamples: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/stylesheet-examples.htmlReference manual: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/stylesheet-reference.html Thomas, you're always welcome. I realise that you are reducing your involvement to focus on other things more important to you. I respect when you told me about having responsibility as a scientist and how you were not doing science by developing Electrum. That's a really cool thing to have an identity that is associated with a noble pursuit of human knowledge.Electrum is a fantastic piece of software, and you've left us lots of puzzle pieces that we must now assemble. I hope we carry the torch forwards and make it great and usable for not just Bitcoin users but the newcomers.Hope you still stick around. At minimum, follow our progress. It was cool working with you, and I value your feedback. You're all not listening to what I'm saying. I am sorry this happened, but not because a large amount of money went missing but because it affected people in personal ways. Affected them personally.My choice of words was poor:I feel far much more for the guy who has lost all of his already small net worth that is paying for his next meal and this month's housing than the guy who has lost a fraction of his already large net worth and has legal recourse available to him.The absolute numbers don't mean much. It's the effect it has on the person's life.What do you say to someone when they email you a desperate plea for help because they might not make next week? I remember one guy in particular. I lost his email because I was being flooded with tons of emails. That was really devastating and hard to deal with. That fat girl is a person you know. Why would you insult her when she's an innocent bystander?I'm not saying I'm happy Roger Ver lost money, but simply that his life is not really impacted in a huge way compared to someone who barely has enough money to survive or eat because they lost it in Bitcoinica. I seem to recall in Vienna that you were talking about renting out an aeroplane. That's a level of extravagance that goes way way over my head. You probably live far more comfortably than the majority of people do including myself. Don't tell me that 25k out of 50k is more of a loss than $200 of $600. That's the difference between homeless and starving, vs surviving. My personal role (not the Consultancy or anyone else's):- Design a new hedging algorithm for Bitcoinica because the existing one was losing Tihan a lot of money for the last few months.More here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93319.msg1038189#msg1038189 Transisto, before Bitcoinica, I had no problems with you and thought you a good person (I still do and don't blame you for being upset over it). But what should I have done differently? You do realise that I have no control over anything.If I don't organise the conference, then it won't happen. It is my experience and knowledge of this opensource-world, conferences and organising other events that means I know how to create a conference. You're essentially saying that there should be no conference because Bitcoinica lost money and I was affiliated with Bitcoinica? That seems pointless. I'm essentially doing this for free anyway.Bitcoinica is all in the hands of business people and lawyers now. The reason I took a long hiatus is because it was seriously effecting my mental health. Several people started to tell me to take time out, but I wouldn't listen to them. Eventually it got too much, and I took their advice. I would've been a broken person unable to do anything otherwise.It did get pretty heavy at one point, but what carried me through was random emails/PMs (reddit, forum, irc) of kindness and support. I never had something like that happen in my life before and it was very touching. Like random strangers on the internet. That was something else. There was one guy even who we exchanged long emails back and forth.For me tbh, I could care less about people like Roger Ver who have a lot of money lost because they have lots more. What really gets me are the people who sent messages like "help! I invested all my money and now i'm borrowing to survive." That's really soul crushing. money is just numbers and w/e. But when it hurts someone physically, that's totally unacceptable to me.EDIT: My choice of words was poor:I feel much more for the guy who has lost all of his already small net worth that is paying for his next meal and this month's housing than the guy who has lost a fraction of his already large net worth and has legal recourse available to him.The absolute numbers don't mean much.

Mi pensas Bitmono esti akceptigxita. oh fuck off. Name me one instance where I lied, or conducted myself improperly. Point them to me. It was me who made public all the emails, released publically all the documents/agreements, released the sourcecode and pushed for communications from zhou's first announcement (everyone told me to be quiet). Your thinly veiled threat is pathetic and petty.We should never have touched the funds in the first place. My viewpoint:ThomasV needed to focus on his work, and was in strictly maintenance mode for Electrum. He came and visited me in Berlin for a week and showed me around the codebase (we also had a cool time - he took me to see the city for the first time despite living there months . He wanted me to manage the project. But then we had disagreements over management styles (I started opening up the development and adding lots of contributors) because I prefer a more open bazaar approach over a cathedral.I can understand the need for being cautious with a project that requires high security when dealing with money, but I think there are many other Free Software projects that do very well with an open development process where everything is made public in the eyes of the community. I prefer not to constrain artists with limitations. This can be seen with the rapid growth Electrum has been getting and the big strides we are making in usability. We're getting lots of feedback from users.Anyway I don't want to fork ever. It is better to pool contributions where possible. In which case, maybe we should have Electrum Stable and Electrum Desktop versions.The protocol is unlikely to change. I only want to improve the implementation (and that will take time). If the protocol does change, it might have the inclusion of the Bitcoin exchange rate. That won't mean that old clients would be affected. But this will take time. Also longer term though I have big improvements for the protocol but they require my thought (ThomasV pointed out that the constraint on low end devices is not computing resources but bandwidth).In terms of the GUI, Animazing has been working a ton. Every change we add, seems to open up a few more needed features so we have a lot of work on that front to do. For sure, I think Electrum can have some massive improvements. I found a nice space for the hackathon:LARC (London Action Resource Centre) has been confirmed and booked as the location for the pre-conference hackathon. They are a self-organised, non-hierarchical projects for radical social change with suitable facilities for a Bitcoin hackathon.http://www.londonarc.org/I've also added more information like accommodation and the address of the conference to the venue page:http://www.bitcoin2012.com/venue Confirmed James McCarthy (nefario) of GLBSE and Jeremias (kangasbros) of AcceptBit, LocalBitcoins as speakers. We sold 10% of the 700 tickets available so far. I'm about to close the issuing of the first 100 tickets.That's really unusual because last year we only ended up selling the tickets during the last week before the conference which made organising it really difficult.Factors in our favour this year:- In London, not the remote location of Prague.- Proven ourselves with first conference.- Good speaker lineup. Fast ticket sales.If we sell out all 700 tickets, then next year we will get the 10,000 people venue and make a huge event about opensource, new economy and Bitcoin topics in general.We've already booked the third room and are going to be offering booths for Bitcoin startups and a lounge for chilling.I'm posting updates on bitcoin2012.com homepage. I messaged them a year ago and they said they weren't interested. We don't have all the information, and I'd avoid leaping to conclusions until you know more. Personally I'm staying out of this as I'm not qualified to make judgements and adequate people are already involved.Here's an extract from an article I wrote: Joerg Platzer of Room77 is now on the speaker list. I put up the schedule, http://www.bitcoin2012.com/schedule Hey,I added details of the venue, places to stay and directions:http://www.bitcoin2012.com/venueI'll put up the schedule soon.For tickets, email genjix@bitcoin2012.com. First 100 tickets are 40. And yet he's willing to pay his own flight ticket, accommodation and speak for free. He also draws a good crowd that brings attention to lesser known developers. He's definitely good for Bitcoin. Update 19th July: payments are still stuck at 38%. Considering that those are 50% payouts, that means a good 76% of the claims. That's not 76% of claimants, but 76% of the total funds.However given that nobody is doing anything, I've been talking with some of the people with large claims. They've proposed helping take over the process with me. I suppose we need to get written consent that Bitcoinica Consultancy doesn't exist or that if it does that the members resign. This allows Bitcoinica LP to take over and hand the payouts process to us. Technically Bitcoinica LP owns the assets.--------repentance: what do you mean get a lawyer? I don't have the ability to do that. I have no savings you know. I don't really take a wage (so there's more money for projects). Many of the Bitcoin developers are not in this for money... Bitcoin is something really special, interesting and quite new. Correct. Call for papers is open. Email genjix@bitcoin2012.com with your proposals. Accepted papers announced at the end of August. No. I don't have the contact of anyone from Bitcoinica LP to ask them...We don't think it's a good idea now to touch the funds from Bitcoinica. We probably shouldn't have even taken on the claims process in the first place, but the pressure was immense and we wanted people to get paid back.No, multiple people had access to the claims process (including me). However, I believe it was Patrick and Tihan who had access to the funds. I'm don't think Tihan actually sent any payments. I think Patrick did all the MtGox USD payments, whereas BTC was done by many people (due to how bitcoins work). No, it was for security.Also Bitcoinica was losing money because its hedging algorithm was too simple, and during the last few months the site had negative profit. My role in the new Bitcoinica was to design a new hedging algorithm. The old algorithm simply had barriers that when reached would begin trading. These values were set manually on the site. I was designing better ways to assess the risk, and reduce it to acceptable levels (3 sigmas or more).And this is why:From: http://bitcoinmedia.com/market-volatility-has-gone-down/Local volatility in the market has gone way down. In the beginning, Bitcoinica could have a non-optimal hedging algorithm and still profit. But now things are getting harder as the Bitcoin economy gets sharper. Hi,Sorry for the hiatus, but I had to take a break to preserve my mental sanity. Here's the update:Let me know if you have any suggestions. Hi,Sorry for the hiatus, but I had to take a break to preserve my mental sanity. Here's the update (also in the OP):
I think it uses key stretching to make such a thing infeasible.Code:    def stretch_key(self, seed):        oldseed = seed        for i in range(100000):            seed = hashlib.sha256(seed + oldseed).digest()        return string_to_number(seed)Although best to ask ThomasV or gmaxwell. Deterministic wallets are pretty standard, so I'm not so sure it's totally easy to guess someone's seed. New mailing list:https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/electrum-discuss We now have a mailing list:https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/electrum-discuss New mailing list: https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/electrum-discuss Posted an update to the OP. the update... https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93074.0 (it is very bad news - a third of claims money stolen) We regret to inform you that there has been another huge breach of Bitcoinica. While all passwords were changed after the theft which occurred May 11th, the password for LastPass was not compromised and thus left unchanged. The breach today occured because the password for LastPass was in fact a duplicate password which had been compromised during the hack.Unbeknownst to us, Tihan was using the mtgox api key as the password for a website called LastPass.LastPass contains all your passwords. The username was info@bitcoinica.com. After the initial compromise, the sourcecode would have been tainted. But the password for LastPass was not changed.The operators of Bitcoinica probably did not think to change it because they may have assumed that the LastPass password was not the same password as the MtGox API key. Such a flaw is a huge security breach. The original hacker could have compromised the funds on May 11th or any day thereafter. Such security practices resulted in the initial theft. By the time we took over the claims process it was under information that the LastPass password was secure. This was infact supposed to be the secure way the new passwords were communicated.This has resulted in the loss of one third of all the Bitcoinica money which has been stolen from MtGox. (40k BTC and 40K USD - the mtgox daily limits)While the initial hacker had the ability to cause this breach it is likely that it was not taken advantage of until many users had access to the sourcecode in a recent leak:Code:genjix:~/tmp/bitcoinica_legacy/config/initializers$ cat mtgox_credentials.rb if Rails.env.production?  MtGox.configure do |config|    config.key = "c02e1a27-5524-449f-ba65-aff9581ddedc"    config.secret = '83U1ROG++O3vwBqFrxpcdyLIoChpgnowImy1oMVQwBLalaLevZDmWeCPJFTrYW00OQ7XUgG53LsIL2pBZ2PQgA=='    endendSourcecode download link: http://depositfiles.com/files/2p6zvadzsThe LastPass password was set to the semi-public api key, this is very similar to using the username for one site as the password on another.Whoever is responsible for the latest theft used the MtGox API key as a password in LastPass hoping that simple security measures were not followed in the setting up of the LastPass. They gained access to MtGox. They transferred a third of the refund money, presumably to themselves. Bitcoinica has had at least 5 major security breaches since it's start. We had recommended that their codebase be entirely rewritten but were not aware of their security practices.I'm starting to regret becoming embroiled with such a shoddy and badly secured site as Bitcoinica.Edit: The API key was changed, but someone had a LastPass account with the same password as that, and was actively updating it with new passwords.40k USD and 40k BTC were stolen (~350k USD).For those who doubt we were not the GP, you can run 'git log' in the sourcecode. We had no responsibility to take on payments, but we did (and finalised the formation of Bitcoinica Consultancy to do so).  The payments process was looking good, but now Patrick has walked away and I'm unsure what happens next. The sourcecode illustrates the magnitude of the problems involved with Bitcoinica (passwords all over the source, bad design, flawed code).We were not privy to all the problems when taking on Bitcoinica. Zhou was being paid $8000 a month for operating Bitcoinica in his part time while Tihan was scrambling to get the site working. During the last month, Zhou was not taking pay, to refund the money stolen by the Linode compromise. Tihan was rushing to get the paperwork finished because Zhou is attending school. We kept sending the paperwork back saying it's incomplete and there's problems, so when the initial compromise happened, the company was not yet fully formed. The initial confusion was over who is responsible as the GP - the part time owner devoting maybe 5 hours a week? The new owners who had no experience operating the site? The middleman who acts on behalf of the owner and has no technical knowledge? That's why payments were initially complicated and delayed.I will post another update once I know more. I'm guessing that payments will have to take a forced 30% cut. This has cost everyone a lot of money, time and stress dealing with this mess. We are actively losing money from dealing with the payouts.Update: here's the facts from my point of view:- Patrick quit.- Zhou quit.- Tihan was fired, and no longer acting on behalf of Bitcoinica LP.- Bitcoinica Consultancy were the new operators coming onboard, and the company was formed after the compromise to facilitate payments out.- Bitcoinica LP is the owner.The payments process is at a deadlock. Technically when a company is in debt, and cannot pay off its debtors in full, it hands the process to the government (called receivership). Bitcoinica LP would have to make a police report, and hand over the payments process as the owners.That's it basically. Just a standstill.No.Update 19th July: payments are still stuck at 38%. Considering that those are 50% payouts, that means a good 76% of the claims. That's not 76% of claimants, but 76% of the total funds.However given that nobody is doing anything, I've been talking with some of the people with large claims. They've proposed helping take over the process with me. I suppose we need to get written consent that Bitcoinica Consultancy doesn't exist or that if it does that the members resign. This allows Bitcoinica LP to take over and hand the payouts process to us. Technically Bitcoinica LP owns the assets. Posting an update soon. 1. Fixed2. Won't fix (for now). Default fiat currency setting - fixed.3. It's a simple rate * amount.4. Not for now. Needs some thought how to do this nicely.Good suggestions. Added them here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Electrum/TODO This system has a flaw lol.Merchant: fuck you, you are not getting your 8 BTC. Sign & Take 2 BTC or 0. It's up to the claimant. They can specify their payment preferences with the main ones at the moment being BTC and MtGox codes. But we're also able to provide other payment options within reason (like bank deposits).2- not sure. I'll have to check and repost here. I think they are being closed at 5 (not sure though).3- it's subjective depending on the claim. My preference would be to assume no position, but it depends on the case itself.~35% of claimants are marked accurate~86% of total funds are marked accurate~25% of total funds have been repaidNo people aren't getting emails when their account status changes. I want to get whether a claim is marked accurate or not added to the claim ticket.Yep, you're right. If your account needs to be reviewed more in depth then you would get a message along the lines of either "your account will take a longer to review" or that "your account is placed at the end of the queue because...". I want to explain the logic behind 50% initial payments:For each claim you have a certainty of its validity. You have the sum of funds from before the site had the database stolen which is equal to the site's previous balance. This sum must be distributed among claims somehow.Ideally you would mark claims that you thought were accurate and those that weren't (based on what the data indicates to us). Then you would end up with some total value which you compare to the total funds available.If less than the total funds, then be more permissive and allow certain more claims in. Repeat the above step.If more than the total funds, then knock out low certainty claims and maybe redistribute funds among lower certainty claims (better that someone who is maybe legitimate, gets something rather than nothing).You then end up with claims that are refunded with a best-fit according to the available data.However people demand funds quickly. So as a compromise, we make 50% payouts initially (for claims we are highly certain are accurate). This allows an error margin so that in the final step we can still juggle balances around to resolve payments for everybody. The only downside is that you cannot decide to pay someone 0% after you've paid them 50%.Then once people have been refunded for 50% and the final balances are decided, the process goes back over payees and refunds them for the remaining amount. I assume the final step should not take long given that it's just making payments out for known beneficiaries. Note that the new Gimp in the current Ubuntu has single window mode (ala every other painting program) under Windows -> Single-Window mode Ah you probably weren't using the latest git version:"* dcff721 (tag: 0.61b-r1) stop ugly flash because qt gui is trying to show itself."https://gitorious.org/electrum/electrum/commit/76474c7eed6bf2ed2cedbdacd0161de333d122c7/diffs/dcff721aa9e52298ce58a494a239db237804f2faThat line was deleted.

How about this?flatfly, fixed. I wasn't able to get it to work on Linux  I'm not too familiar with Java but it just didn't start up. The problem with moving the balance:- Click the label- Type stuff inside the amount fieldSee what happens. You lose that functionality with it in the titlebar. Banks are some of the scummiest and dishonest organisations around. Money laundering, market manipulation, anti-competitive practices and obscene dishonesty are their call sign. They are in bed with mafioso and Russian oligarchs.Also you don't really hate banks until you've been forced to deal with them for 2 years of your life. Say for instance, if you run a Bitcoin exchange. They are absolute trash, retarded backwards systems run by idiots, retards and dickheads.I go every so often to financial conferences. All I see around me are dumbasses in suits. I always wonder how the fuck they are getting paid so much for doing so little. They are soooo stupid. And they are obsessed with fads. Once one banker spouts a meme, it becomes a mad rage. Maybe the meme-originator will write a book with a fancy title and then be invited to every banker conference in existence for eternity while little bankers spout the same recycled, repackaged and redundant memes until another charlatan comes along. The current memes are: the cashless society (that would be horrible) and mobile payments (to the max).They never really get Bitcoin because it is so outside of their reality. They can only have it related in terms of concrete things, and lack the ability to think abstractly. Men of the system, bound by regimentation and schedules, robotic tin-headed men of shiny simple things and boring blaa blaa are opposite to the Bitcoiner type. The Bitcoiner type is more like the conspiracy theorist who believes all people are secretly full of cynicism, hate, ... or a romantic imaginer of distant lands, worlds and eternity and genuinely wants to liberate mankind from the haughty shackles of poverty and disempowerment, or even a curious mind who sees growth-potential in a booming economy and is playfully along for the ride (and hey, maybe some profit ). To an extent I guess we're all parts of those in different doses. If you setup a TOR hidden service then we can see how easy it is, and try to set it up. A TCP Stratum server running over Tor.I'm guessing it should be trivial (hopefully). OK this should be fixed now if you wanna test. Interesting. I guess 2. is a problem then.A tooltip might not be immediately obvious. I changed it to "Copy My Address" but that seems a bit wordy. Try it out and tell me what you think.I'm thinking maybe a small popup should appear over the button with the address and some text saying "Your bitcoin address for receiving funds has been copied to your clipboard!". I'm wondering if a minimal/small popup that closes by itself might still be sacrificing usability and quickness by increasing the number of clicks. But certainly now there isn't enough "feedback" as to the action that's just happened.I'm glad the SSL thing isn't a bother. Saves me a tiny bit of effort  I did. I told you what I know happened. You said no. I said OK, fine ask Patrick. bitcoinBull, OK, take it up with Patrick. I'm just retelling a story. about forum PMs - please email the address. Getting too many messages and need them all in one place. ~35% of claimants are marked accurate~86% of total funds are marked accurate~25% of total funds have been repaid(about blow ups, I am careless/irresponsible and not security conscious - hence I don't have admin root access on Intersango.)Zhou is totally correct in what he says. We (Bitcoin Consultancy) have taken on responsibility for the payments. In order to do that, we had to complete the paperwork for the formation of Bitcoinica Consultancy. He's also not directly involved, but has been helpful with the odd query when needed (despite not being involved).About converting the balances: if you prefer USD, then you can specify it on your payments option for the claims. 1. yeah I noticed this. Will have to fix it. (edit: fixed this)2. But then how will you get your receiving address?3. I see. Let me investigate this. Thanks for letting me know.4. Software always looks pretty crude initially. We'll have to fine-tune it as we go along. Perfection is a journey. But I definitely want to have it be eye-candy.

Point is that I wouldn't be living like a pauper if I had scammed lots of money. You can check my entire history since 2003 on the internet, and you'll see that I've been working on Free/OpenSource software as a dayjob for 10 years. Those jobs pay far less than proprietary/normal commercial jobs and it's always a struggle. I've never been money oriented or concerned with earning money.Don't believe what I'm saying? Then google my name 'Amir Taaki' or my nickname 'genjix'. Several times I was living as a squatter, homeless or living out of a backpack. All my programming history is on OpenSource projects.Also there's many people who can say what my true character is like:My CouchSurfing page: http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/genjixHackathon I organised: http://crystalspace3d.org/main/La_Fibra_hackfest_report (most of those people are on IRC)Here's a picture from 2008, when I was still a leftist. I was always against greed, but at the time did not understand economics. That control of money is another form of fascism.My other pics for anyone who wants to play detective: http://www.flickr.com/photos/genjix/Here's some writing of mine before getting into Bitcoin: https://n-1.cc/pg/blog/read/44422/jbhttps://n-1.cc/pg/blog/read/44421/fssYou can decide yourself whether I am a scammer. A scammer would not be posting here. Also if you read some of the forum posts, some people say they were answered by email that they are accurate, and some were told they were at the end of the queue. A scammer would tell everyone they are marked accurate.Now it is slow, but the data is incredibly bad. But at the very worst, payouts will be completed within 2 months (or at least the large significant portion of them done). We only have the funds for the site. Mistakes that get made will cost people real money. Mistaken payments will not be refunded (hence the 50% first solution).I'm inviting people to dug up dirt on me because there is none.Show me the police report. I'd rather not give people's personal details in public. I didn't scam anyone. Say how you expect people to be refunded without a database.We're trying the best we can.Point me to one question where I lied. I've been around all the time, posting answers to questions and answering emails. Also I give the full story as it happened in the OP. Your story is nothing more than a conspiracy theory.As I said, if someone wants to sue then I'll provide my name and details for the police report. No one has taken that offer yet. We are happy to open our books to the relevant authorities. Tihan has also offered up his personal details. We have not acted maliciously once.Currently I have 200 emails. A scammer would not bother answering and looking up people's claims for them. I also would not be using a crappy IBM Thinkpad T61 if I wasn't short on cash. Our conduct before Bitcoinica has been nothing but exemplary (point me to an occasion where it wasn't), and we've always operated with utmost honesty.But I guess there is no other way to convince you otherwise, so it is a pointless discussion as you've already made up your mind.@Transisto, I did say it was a slow process. And actual payouts only begun 2 weeks ago (see the OP). We had to sort out the legal issues with Tihan (who has legal control over the funds), create a claims system, organise all the data and start the process. This isn't something you do in 3 days, but 2 weeks. Consider that it 2 months of legal negotiation with Bitcoinica as to our role we would be taking, and when the hack happened, we we still completing the ownership transfer: yes, unless you specify otherwise. Oh, I did not add it to the setup/install system. Testing/fixing now. Current version:========Hi,Electrum has a new lite-mode GUI. The normal expert-mode is available when clicking the expand button in the bottom right.I'm interested in feedback people have:* Entering a number in the amount field will show the conversion amount.* Clicking the balance label changes the currency between USD/GBP/EUR.* Click the bottom left button to show the normal 'expert-mode' GUI.* Address box has text completion for address book entries.Currently only 1 account exists (top left button) called "Checking". Multiple accounts will be added in the next release.-----------Looking for feedback. Lots of design work went into this. My old design notes are pasted below (much of it is on paper). I eventually dropped the system tray concept as it's rapidly falling out of favour in desktops. If you look at the dock concept being adopted by Mac, Windows 7 and Ubuntu, then there is this movement towards having a single place where a program runs. Clicking an app to restore it (from minimised state) or start it up (from closed state) has no big distinction. Electrum with its quick startup times fits this kind of model for users. There should be little functional difference between closing or minimising Electrum to your dock.Old screenshots: Hi,Electrum is now at the beta candidate before we make a release for general use.Please beta test.*** We have a new Czech translation (CS) thanks to 1byte! ***New lite GUI on by default. This is for convenience and simplicity to allow you to use Bitcoin while doing other tasks like web-browsing. Electrum targets beginner users, and we want to streamline everything as much as possible from install, and startup to use. Bitcoin clients should be small and uncomplicated.* Entering a number in the amount field will show the conversion amount.* Clicking the balance label changes the currency between USD/GBP/EUR.* Click the bottom left button to show the normal 'expert-mode' GUI.* Address box has text completion for address book entries.Currently only 1 account exists (top left button) called "Checking". Multiple accounts will be added in the next release.Design notes can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=91339.0#electrum on Freenode IRC Sorry about the email.@ssaCEO, I don't have a way to search for USD payments but I see at least 2 people with their USD payments paid back. I assume there's more. However USD payments are slower since Donald doesn't have direct access to them (goes through a second person).
If you email bitcoinica.reimburse@gmail.com then I can tell you.So far ~50 people have been paid out. Around 4x as many people are marked accurate. Right now, I think people marked as accurate will be paid back first. If you aren't in that category then you'll have to wait until after they're paid, at which point a new batch of people will be marked with accurate status. And so on, until 50% payouts have been done.Originally me and Tihan marked a bunch of people as accurate based on our assessment of character. This is how Zhou wanted to pay people back quickly (just by deciding who is notable and who isn't). However Donald, who's largely taken the initiative on the payments prefers to do them completely based the numbers. As he's taken charge of it, I prefer to respect his decision on that. So people who send us emails like "I'm so trusted in the community" - that really does not have much bearing (for now).The claims are making good progress. It's expected to be slow but I'm satisfied and don't want Donald to rush the process / make mistakes. That would be the worst thing ever as we only have the exact funds from the site. Nope. I would simply CC it to verify@bitcoinica.com and then add the information myself to people's claims. Any information you have can help your claim get processed faster:- MtGox deposit codes- Any emails received from Bitcoinica- Photograph of your ID to prove account ownership- Bitcoin transaction IDs or addresses used with Bitcoinica.Send any information to bitcoinica.reimburse@gmail.com Anyone want to buy BTC off me for 800 CZK at the price of 5.33? (Prague)EDIT: deal done. Thanks. OK, sorry I took it so personally. I understand the frustration, but I'm confident that progress is being made now. It will take time. Donald has taken the initiative largely and is making solid progress. There are some holdups, and Zhou is being helpful too by sharing information needed.There's something with Tihan going on, but I am not following that because it's unneeded drama for me - it seems he got fired, although I'm not sure for what. Personally I don't know if it's justified because I don't know the specifics. On the one hand, his boss felt the need to do so. On the other hand, when Bitcoinica was first hacked, I was terrified and suicidal at the thought that users funds could not be replaced. Tihan put those funds up, which is why we can now process payments out. Tihan is not holding it up I don't think. It's just time consuming.And 27% of the claimed value (not 1 in 6) has been paid out so far. Consider that's for 50% of their claimed value. What do you mean by "you". We were not even involved in Bitcoinica during that time. We did not move to rackspace VPS. I don't know what game you are playing, but I know that you know this.I only notarised the signed document for the formation of Bitcoinica the day before the hack. This is public information, yet somehow you are implying false things which is very sly and strange. The only thing we are guilty of is that Patrick's personal email got added access to critical infrastructure without his knowledge, and that his email was compromised. And now it is us that bears the brunt of processing payouts.You know this. Yet you seem intent to just make fun of me. Are you bitter or something? Did I burn you? It's honestly pathetic considering that we hung out in London a few times, you seemed a cool person and I vouched for your trusted character to others. I'm seeing a lot of claims marked accurate (especially the larger ones). 75% of the claimed value has been marked as accurate with the remaining ones marked 'undecided' (the vast majority). This number is hugely skewed by a few people with very large balances.The total amount actually paid out thus far is 1/6th of the total claimed value.Well there's a competing dichotomy here. To process the claims, we have limited information and we cannot tell people what we know and don't know exactly. It's a process of rebuilding a database with imperfect information against malicious agents.People are getting paid out, but again as I said, the process is very slow. In fact Donald right now has done the majority of work. Many of the claims I processed got reverted because I was making mistakes and doing them improperly. :/ There is lots of information, and a bunch of bottlenecks. For instance, lets say one staff member has access to information X, which the other staff member needs, then there's lag there. So it's not totally as efficient as it could be.I favoured using a completely mathematical/statistical approach (build stats to cross match and home in on an acceptable dataset using hypothesis testing and confidence intervals). But the others decided that it's less risky and better to do them manually (despite taking longer). I still think the statistical approach is a good one and worth the risk. Are you asking me to make a blog?Yes, it was people in this thread asking for regular updates on payouts (which I'm giving). I cannot both be active, and not be active in giving updates. This has got to be the stupidest post I've read. Why would be blogging instead of processing payouts? And putting ads on there? I'd rather not be a businessman then. Thanks for the bad advice. Best to wait. The Electrum server I made was a prototype. It had lots of hardcoded paths and such isms:https://gitorious.org/electrum/server/blobs/master/backends/libbitcoin/memory_buffer.hpp (see 2nd include) Yes, the Python bindings need to be updated since the libbitcoin API changed. I'll get onto that soon as I need to get the Electrum server running again. I plan to rebuild the backend in C++ though.

It's just depressing when people get focused on the fine details and differences between peoples, instead of looking at the bigger picture and thinking how we can make things better for all. Details that cause killing between one group of brown people that pray to a wall and another group of brown people to pray to a black rock - both the same people.Well Carl Sagan says it better than I do, and this video often tears me up:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pfwY2TNehw Why is religion everywhere? I've had a hard long day and I come here to geek out over science, nerdy stuff and bitcoin and there is a bloody raging religion conversation in every single place. I want some peace. Blaa blaa God metaphysics - no one cares. tcatmsiriusamillercopumpkintheymos I am supposed to only give out the status for emails. Accounts are in 3 states:- Fake. This is a minority of accounts so far we are certain are impostors.- Accurate. At my last count, this was around 1 in 20 (5%). Only a portion of these has been paid so far. Still working through paying these people back (I don't have access to funds personally. It works like Donald gets a portion and does them in chunks at a time with proper authorisation from Tihan and Patrick).- Queued. Majority of claims are in the queue waiting to be examined. Around half (a guess) of claims I believed were accurate, and various fakes got pushed back into the "lets examine then later category". Most simply haven't been looked at yet.The idea is to sort out claims with the highest certainty (this means quicker payouts), then as you work down, you reconcile them with other payments. I know people here are congratulating me, but I've actually been a hindrance for the claims process. Several times, I caused some mix-ups and confusion so Donald hands me batches/tasks to complete at a time.
mlawrence, call the police. I will cooperate fully.Also, it wasn't our staff that lost the backups. Zhou was admining the site, and he had no backups. One of our responsibilities would have been to create a backup system after the takeover.He doesn't interact much with the community. He sometimes uses the nickname Incitatus on IRC. Take it to a different thread. This is for payment updates.My identity has been public since day 1 of Bitcoin. Our pictures and identities are on the front of intersango.com. Our company info is on the about page which has a number and address. My house address is on google. We've run many honest services for 2 years now in bitcoin land. Your post = FUD and smear. Take it to a different thread as I want to keep this thread for simple payment updates and answering people's legitimate concerns. My name is public, and my address/location too. If you want to get the police involved, I would be fine to go to them and let them have the problem to deal with. Good luck getting any money back then ever. I've got nothing to hide. Bitcoin people are always believing conspiracy theories like us making money from interest or it being an inside job.To be honest, interest payments would not cover our time investment for processing payments out. It is a net loss considering I'm worth $50+ per hour. I charge $200 per hour for consulting work, and here I am spending 20 mins at a time researching claims and answering emails for sums less than $10. Doing this for interest payments would be absolutely stupid. It takes a long time because it's complicated. We're paying people back because it's the right thing to do. Yes, the SSL provider is having uptime difficulties. bitcoin.it (the wiki) also has problems. Nice. I was expecting another braindead "selfish" explanation of earning more money, bitches or fame. Simple fact is that I think people like to create, and feel inspired. I don't like pouring the precious hours of my life into a blackhole that will disappear in a few years time. It's nice to write things people will use to bring more wealthy, happiness and benefit to their lives rather than software which causes misery and vendor-lockin. Our job as coders is not to imprison people but to set their minds free. I'm not sure what you're asking. Yes it deletes code separators.Check my code here (I think it is easier to understand):https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/blobs/master/src/script.cppSearch for bool script::op_checksigverify(...)You see the look where I create the script_code object? It loops from the last codehash position until the end of all the operations, skipping the signature or any codeseparators. Everything else is pushed to the new script object which is then used for the check_signature function.I would suggest not copying Bitcoin's representation of scripts and instead store the parse tree for scripts. It makes it much easier for the user from an API perspective. Just remember that coinbases are unparsable so you'll need either a special script type or opcode for a raw_script (which is uninterpretable). Hmmm OK. I'll setup a new VPS to get compatibility with the LTS again. I'm making some simplifications, optimisations and cleanup of the interface for the next release. The problem is that all the Linux distributions are moving towards g++ 4.7 which implements the C++11 standard fully and were complaining about compilation problems.It turns out that g++ 4.6 implements the C++11 incorrectly which causes an incompatibility for me (that I had to workaround using macros). I eventually said whatever and decided to fully transition to 4.7 as it will become the norm in the new Ubuntu which is being released in ~2 months time.More info:http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.htmlhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/7214623/rule-for-lambda-capture-variablehttps://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project/libcxx/trunk/include/system_error?view=markup&pathrev=153194 (incorrect noexcept specifier in 4.6)I plan to make Ubuntu builds again when the new version (Quantal) is released. Yes, you're correct.Personally I think the majority of people will be refunded. However there will be honest people who are mistakenly classified as fake and not repaid back. Or others who get paid back less. I really want everyone to get paid back fully, but I'm not going to lie and say that we're going to recreate a perfect database from imperfect records. The process will be fair albeit slow. There's not any other better way around this (I don't think). ninjarobot, thanks.I think some of the biggest payments are being made soon (possibly today). It's just we wanted to be extra careful that there was no trivial oversights. For instance we could afford to mistakenly pay out $20 but not $30,000.Evidence that people send does help, but it is not definitive. We use the evidence you send to try to find matches for you in our records. But if we don't have a record of it, then digital evidence is easily faked and does not mean much. I work everyday.About the payouts: working on it. Not much to add except going slowly through accounts to verify the low hanging fruit. There are some accounts marked accurate but they aren't immediately paid because the balance is so large.It could be a devastating blow if a large amount is paid erroneously, so those accounts require more checking. When something is needed, we contact the people to ask them. It's hard to know ahead of time. Stratising is where you connect to multiple chain-services and only accept the common shared history that they give your client (Electrum .etc).Assume that you connect to n chain-services controlled by different organisations/individuals. There is an average expected risk r per service that they are compromised by a single attacker. Not that each service gives false info, malfunctions, but that they are compromised by the /same/ attacker. We assume this to be an independent probability.The chance of being cheated, pp = r^nThe more services you connect to, p drops exponentially very fast because r < 1I suspect users would choose the services or they are bundled with the client. After we've paid everyone we intend to pay, their initial 50%. Then afterwards we double back and refund the remaining 50%.BTW, I'm getting lots of forum PMs. I cannot respond to them in an efficient way. Please use: bitcoinica.reimburse@gmail.com People wanting to know about their claims status should email:bitcoinica.reimburse@gmail.comI set it up so me and Donald can answer queries and have a record we can check, as opposed to my not so good riseup email. The emails are piling up. I need to make some tools though to better analyse the data first rather than doing it manually. I have a big backlog of email which I will go through tonight or tomorrow. I need to export this data and write some tools to easier display info for people's accounts. People are divided into different classes depending on how certain we are of their claim. As we move through verifying accounts, we become more certain. Once everyone is refunded for 50% we then double back through all refunds and refund the last 50% at the very end. I was mistakenly missing 1 file when processing the claims which I've now got. I'll now be able to confirm more people now that I might not have before. Allow people to upload photos of themselves, and pay you to verify their account (take their ID and stuff).Also the search function could be better (have a giant box which accepts post codes, city names or similar) with the ability to filter by currency. It would be good to show the city for sellers and buyers because I have no idea about distances on the scale of 100s of Km, but I do know all the local nearby cities/towns. In the UK at least, distance isn't always proportional to ease of access / cost of travel- Ramsgate -> Manchester is cheaper than Ramsgate -> Milton Keynes despite being massively closer.
No.What helps is sending your information or anything usable to verify@bitcoinica.com to be attached to your ticket. Getting the numbers exactly right if you can remember them is also very useful.What will hurt your claim is an inaccurate or falsified report. Claims not matching the records are pushed to the back of the queue. We can meet today if you want. Send me an email to genjix@riseup.net.Reducing the cost in risk * cost while we have a high uncertainty for payments. Certainty goes up as we process more payments. At the end, we have a higher certainty that we can send the remaining 50%. This is the sacrifice for having any kind of timely payments where users don't cover the cost of mistakes. 1- yes. Going through them one by one.2- less than 1%. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to say how many people. But it's a small number.3- hopefully we get faster with experience. Much of the slow speed is a lack of supporting system to act efficiently.4- we will bear the cost (I assume). People do have their coins. We've been processing payments out during the last few days. But the process is extremely slow and tedious. Sorry, I've updated this info. The dates are final as the venue and everything have been booked. We were just about to announce the conference before this Bitcoinica debacle. I don't think you get it. BitcoinSpinner / Electrum are fine on a smartphone and the scalability optimisations can be applied. Also entropy can be generated.These devices are REALLY low spec. They are very very simple devices to simply sign a tx and hold a single key. In fact they are so small that it's tough keeping a bitcoin tx in memory. I have a question to people who think these are a winner.The issue seems to be a social issue not a technological one. Do people prefer a secure dedicated device over a less secure mobile phone which offers a far superior featureset?Random thoughts here:- Devices are so low spec that it makes it difficult to implement any of the blockchain scalability optimisations that can be used for Electrum. Much of the processing is moved server side which assuming it ever did the volume that is mass usage, would be a serious problem.- Im not sure that the hardware on these devices can generate enough entropy. A friend (niekt0) told me that ECDSA (unlike other encryption schemes) requires entropy for each signing, not only for generating keys.- Ive seen an addon device for mobile phones that allows secure key signing to be possible via an attached USB or similar device. The functionality for a mobile phone is far more advanced that these low spec devices.- Even if dedicated devices are more secure, mobile phones have more popular adoption. For small amounts of spending cash, their security is adequate. For larger amounts, larger devices or services are fine. Bitcoinica issue is delaying the organisation of this. Until Bitcoinica payouts have been made (which should hopefully be within a month). Fuck you asshole. Our data is rubbish. What would you have us do? Refund every scammer? Or maybe just friends/people on this forum leaving out those not in the community. I never even touched Bitcoinica, and here I am going through hundreds of lines of nonsensical numbers and writing emails, not code. Your guilt by association is retarded considering we've run our own service for 2 years no without a single login or problem incident. Bitcoinica was a load of crap that had been broken into twice before due to incompetence and Tihan realised this, and rushed to acquire us. I was just looking at a piece of code for hedging and saw 3 bugs and numerous hacks to work around flaws. It doesn't surprise me that third time lucky it blows up.The data is incomplete. To build a case you need to understand the big picture. Once you make a refund, you aren't getting the money back. I think only the scammers are making noise here to rush the process for their selfish gains. The most claimants so far that have emailed me have been very polite because they don't want to jeopardise their claim. yeah I saw the magazine too. It was really nicely done.It would be good to see more things focusing on the social aspect and talking about things outside bitcoin but related to it in the free culture and hacker movements. Things like the free wifi (how bitcoin can fund meshnets), tech for circumventing kettling by police .etc I had to click 3 links: http://bitcoinmagazine.net/bitcoin-magazine-approved-for-barnes-noble-us-distribution/Nice one though. Was it easy? I imagine the hard part is staying there. A few months ago I saw that some stores in the UK stopped stocking Linux magazines I just finished answering the emails people sent to me asking about their claim's status. If you didn't receive a reply yet then email me again. If you email me from your Bitcoinica email, I can tell you the status of your claim. No database, a huge mass of data (much of it useless) and a number of false claims that could push out legitimate claims. The data makes sense only as a whole which makes payouts difficult (you have to build a case and gather evidence based on the known data). Being careless and paying people without being sure is stupid as you cannot reverse payments if more evidence later ends up contradicting your early guess.That's why the initial payouts so far have been for only 50%. And only for people we're highly certain of. I support extending that to more, but the others are understandably taking more caution. If people are paid out, then it's realised there is a mistake in our assumptions, that means legitimate people will not get paid (the pool of money for payouts is limited). $1 erroneously paid out, is $1 of someone else's money. The honest and correct decision here is being as certain as possible for people you pay out, and no amount of shouting will speed up the process. The records for making the payouts are incredibly bad and inefficient. It might take 15 mins to check a single person before you realise that the records on hand for that person are useless/contradictory. Now multiply this by 100s of people.Someone earlier mentioned hiring people but that's not an option here. I would not trust a relative unknown with this data and the time/effort involved with finding a new person who would be competent does not make it a positive tradeoff. Except we already did make some payments for confirmed people.I support paying the initial round of people marked as 'accurate', but the process is not under my control. And I can understand why there is a need for more thorough checking. There is no database, a huge mass of data (much of it useless) and a number of false claims that could push out legitimate claims. I was told this:"I would suggest that the communication should be strictly about payments progress. Daily factual one-liners as in: "Today we verified 20 balances." or "We expect payments to begin on Friday", or "We're working on a secure system for issuing MtGox codes.""If you send me a message to genjix@riseup.net then I'll forward you on to them. Positions will be liquidated around 5 +/- 0.1 depending on the exact math (a close price that's a suitable middle ground between longs and shorts). Example quick text-interface client for anyone who wants to have a go at trying to make a Qt version: https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/blobs/master/tests/crap/main.cpp Not all the password hashes exist. Only a few of them. That's why it says no password hash found. The record is not an old record but simply a recent sample of a random bunch of users. It does not matter how old your account is.Just tried the email and it seems to work fine for me. I am not the correct person to answer your questions. I have messaged the correct person.
I don't know the policy yet on positions.About the ETA: the records here are immense. It took me 2 hours to do a handful of people. I calculated that it would take one person 10 days assuming they do 10 hour days - which you don't want to do because you make mistakes. 4 hours a day is the absolute maximum (with another person checking the info).5% of people are verified so far. This is the guy making it: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6974216.stmAlso: I saw bitcoincard, and the device is legit. It has only minor kinks that are easy to work out.I'll avoid posting more as they're quite sensitive to exposing their secrets right now, but the device is really cool. I'm hopeful for it.First off:- It's tiny. Credit card sized and < 1 mm thick- Low cost (cheap device)- Low power (runs off solar)- Theoretically it should be secure, but I need to know more of their setup first to be sure their implementation is secure. I'm guessing there may be a couple of vectors they haven't thought of yet, but with proper help they should resolve this.For merchants, it's trivial and safe to allow Bitcoin payments from these. They also look pretty nifty.I can imagine one day, Intersango giving away a basket of these for free branded with our logo (or something). They are really cheap and simple devices.I'm not questioning the tech tbh, but more whether people would prefer this over mobile phones (a social problem) despite improved security. Phones can do way more than this device so I'm not sure. http://bitcoinmedia.com/catherine-flick-bitcoin-and-the-dual-use-dilemma/ You should quote the entirety of my post:Bitcoinica Consultancy registration was never completed. I for instance had not signed and my documents weren't notarised. Similar things for others. So there is no clear ownership here.Tihan was asking for completion of the registration for Bitcoinica Consultancy, whereas Donald was asking for legal authorisation from Core Credit.Tihan sent this email:Donald:Tihan:(And then this goes backwards and forwards with Donald asking for Andrew Thornhill's contact details, and Tihan saying we don't need them, as we are in charge. The issue being of course that Bitcoinica Consultancy is a non-existent/unformed company)He also sent me an email asking me for the documents to complete the formation of Bitcoinica Consultancy, which is a bit weird as we're paying people back, and I don't have a spare day or two to go get my documents notarised.Anyway I'm not sure who's right between Donald (being excessively "by the book") or Tihan (trying to limit his perceived involvement). But it does not matter who is legally in charge right now as the way forwards is clear and everyone is in agreement about what needs to be done. We will make the payments, we now have consolidated all the records and the money. Matthew N Wright is not involved with Bitcoinica (from what I know). That's not to say him and Zhou Tong did not ever have friendly relations. It's common among Bitcoin people that we all speak and share ideas despite being 'competitors'. For instance I advise Andreas how to improve his Bitcoin client despite that I'm working on a different client. We all want Bitcoin to succeed, and better services = better community for all.For instance I gave advice to Matthew about his magazine despite writing for BitcoinMedia. I think it's a cool project and want it to succeed.Anyway I'd prefer to keep this thread on topic. Make a separate thread for periphery topics. - serialisation has changed. more intuitive and uses native c++ features to support extendability for saving and loading of bitcoin messages.- async_service now provides access to underlying io_service ptr which is now the requirement for services. I don't like this witch-hunt for Zhou Tong. Please stop it. He is still young and it is unfair to be too harsh. When I was young, I also did many stupid and seemingly unforgivable things I wish I didn't do. Is it really worth ruining the life of a child as retribution? That's so petty.As for the funds. It is being worked on. Of course we want everyone paid back, but it isn't so easy. Consider that we have run an exchange for nearly 2 years now which has been operating with the utmost honesty and respect, having never been compromised dealing with comparable levels of funds as Bitcoinica. Although we are conservative and cautious in our actions, we acted slowly and deliberately to be sure there were no further disastrous mistakes. The legality of the payments had to be sorted out and checked first, and proper systems had to be developed to enable staff to collaborate and corroborate records to the most accurate possible. Just under 10% of claims have been verified, and I'm waiting on those payments to be made out soon. Also: I saw bitcoincard, and the device is legit. It has only minor kinks that are easy to work out.I'll avoid posting more as they're quite sensitive to exposing their secrets right now, but the device is really cool. I'm hopeful for it.First off:- It's tiny.

I'm guessing there may be a couple of vectors they haven't thought of yet, but with proper help they should resolve this.For merchants, it's trivial and safe to allow Bitcoin payments from these. They also look pretty nifty.I can imagine one day, Intersango giving away a basket of these for free branded with our logo (or something). They are really cheap and simple devices. This is false. It happens fairly often in fact that someone sends to an address and then debits in the same block. The only restriction is that the transactions have to be chronologically ordered in the block (due to the way bitcoin blocks are processed) If anyone wants a place to stay, I have an extra bed and a sofa for people to crash on. Also lots of floor space. Hopefully they get done soon I think. One of the points outlined today by Tihan was:"This is what I need from each of you today:1) A sign of life that the claims processing has begun -- an announcement to that effect and/or actually paying people back..."So things are moving forwards now after the hiatus. Most people involved are in agreement on what needs to be done. No. It was hacked because someone's personal email was compromised. https://intersango.com/security.phpIntersango uses SHA512 + salt + site wide secret This is the third time Bitcoinica has been compromised. Everyone knew there were security problems. That's why we were signed on to help secure it. Not only that, but the site was losing money because of the inefficient way it was being run. These were problems which were identified, and a plan drawn up to fix them. The plan did not get a chance to run beyond the bare beginning. Normally our policy for identified flaws in Intersango is to shut down the site until it's fixed. However I think with Bitcoinica, it wasn't our site to shut down (imagine bringing someone on and they shut down your site). But once Bitcoinica was compromised, we had it shut down, and it will stay shut down until people are paid. It will not go back online unless it is secure and in our total control. This is different to Bitomat or MtGox who were compromised and had identified flaws, but kept operating regardless. The situation here is complicated by the fact that Bitcoinica was undergoing a transition during this interval, and the specifics or leadership and technicals were still being agreed upon. It was during this time, that the keys were being slowly handed over and the documents were being signed (I only went to try and notarise my signature the day before the attack). There were no backups. Until Saturday (or so), I was working on helping process the claims. Since then I've been working on libbitcoin and Electrum.Now the thing is that for payments to be processed, we need legal authorisation from the person in charge. Tihan denies being in charge, which means his parent company (Core Credit) has to authorise the payments. However Tihan is saying we don't need that.The problem is that Bitcoinica Consultancy only begun the process of being formed when the attack happened. The paper work was not completed and we weren't acting as GP. Tihan is asking us to finish completing the formation of Bitcoinica Consultancy first, while we are asking for legal authorisation to conduct payments on their behalf.But I think the issue may be resolved now although I'm not sure of the specifics (I'm not a lawyer). Hopefully someone acting on proper legal representation can respond.Anyway I'm going to avoid posting now, since the technical problems have been resolved, and the remaining things are legal. I've probably made a bunch of mistakes or inaccuracies above as I don't have a complete understanding of this and don't have a legal background. I know as much as Zhoutong really. I try not to post unless I'm sure what I'm saying is correct or meaningful. Fixed for g++ 4.7Related: http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2012-02/msg00201.html OK, seems like Ubuntu Quantal uses g++ 4.7 (release date is October) and many distributions are phasing in the new toolchain. I think it's because g++ 4.7 implements the vast majority of the new C++ standard so it's being fast tracked in.I'm upgrading to a system with 4.7 so hopefully I should be get it working with the new compiler now. I met the OpenSim people and they didn't really care much for Bitcoin. Also: they are pro-copyright, and think that downloading media is stealing.
Yes it's done. The problem is not technical but bureaucratic. Anyway hopefully this gets resolved quickly. Don't really have much more to add right now. It was taken down while investigating the compromise of Bitcoinica. No-one has the time to put it back up yet because of managing these payouts to people We don't hold the funds.Finalising the current one for internal (staff) usage. We need to track the payments we make more accurately for book keeping. 03 June 2012 23:20: We're adding extra fields to the claims database (should be finished soon), we have received the funds from Tihan to make the initial payouts. Then once that's done, the first round of payments can be finished. 02 June 2012 21:26: The process is at an impasse because of some legal wrangling. Hey, this is my valid key: CCF588E3. The other one is old and I need to revoke it. Make sure you mention it's encrypted for me.Also avoid sending things to my personal email if you want to keep it secure. That email is used on public terminals and is not secure - it's a personal email. Otherwise if you don't mind then you can CC me, but make sure it does actually get sent to verify@bitcoinica.com None of those are a factor as to whether we have a high degree of certainty in a person. We are not using a trust metric, but simply extraditing the process for people with a high degree of certainty.People with the largest balances may in fact take longer to verify.Bitcoinica does not make money off of holding people's money. If anything it costs us in terms of time.The reason Bitcoinica used to give people interest was to encourage people to let their money sit there so that Bitcoinica does not need to hedge as often between USD and BTC (which is costly and expensive given MtGox's fees).I never said anything on IRC nor bad-mouthed anyone.About email: not everyone appreciates constant small updates sent to their inbox. However once we are ready to move forwards, a mass email will be sent detailing everything. I don't know since I don't have full access to Bitcoinica's records (Tihan has those). But I can see the claims and the total net value is $1.1 million. I don't know what the full amount previously was (Patrick or Zhou knows) but I do know it is a few times less than the total claims. We aren't doing that though. We are not using a trust metric, but simply extraditing the process for people with a high degree of certainty.Also if you do have a forum nickname, and somehow feel it helps you then feel free to email it to the claims email. You're totally right. I dislike this too, but it is the most amicable solution available.If you have anything that can help, then email verify@bitcoinica.comThere's an internal system being used to collate and organise all this information. Yes. People with a high rating within the community. These people are having their process expedited.Originally Zhou favoured simply paying people out based on reputation (trust-based approach) whereas we (me and Patrick) supported divvying funds up accordingly among people (pro-rata). That was the nature of the disagreement and why Zhou was saying he could do immediate payouts quickly if we handed over the process. We did not think this was fair despite people calling for him to handle the process. The final method that's been mutually agreed upon by all is a hybrid method - using both approaches.That's why I said one method is fast but inaccurate, while the other is slower but more accurate. It's a difficult decision though. And despite the criticism, I'm going to perform the payouts in the way that I personally think is most fair for all. There are a lot of people on this forum who don't have a voice so it would be unfair to simply payout to people based on reputation alone. Sorry about the above. It was a slip up by me. Tihan is correct.30 May 23:30: We're going to proceed with payouts of the few people we have verified hopefully tomorrow for 80% of their claims (the remaining 20% will be refunded later). A more lengthy process will be applied to everyone else.EDIT: I was under the impression he was acting strictly on behalf of the decision makers due to our conversations and the decisions that have been made thus far. I will confirm that we indeed have the ability to make this decision regarding the claims. 30 May 01:52: Consensus seems to have been reached. Waiting for final confirmation to move ahead so we can work out the actual payout implementation specifics. I would actually email verify@bitcoinica.com and ask them. I was deliberately vague. It isn't which payment system to use, but which method of selecting payees (people to be paid) to ensure accurate or fast delivery (it is a bit of a sliding scale). Maybe I can post more specifics, but I want to ask first in case I somehow jeopardise the prospect of a speedy recovery for everyone. Also I'd want to make sure what I write is correct. I'll post updates here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=84042That's the new thread. Historic posts detailing progress:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=81045.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=81045.msg921159#msg921159Transisto is maintaining a helpful thread detailing all Bitcoinica posts and notable posts: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=89782.0 I will post information here as I receive it.28 May 07:00: Discussion right now is centered on the nature of selecting payess. There is the question of what nature the system for choosing payees should take with different people favouring 1 of 2 approaches (one is fast and unreliable, the other slow and reliable). I can't say more than that for technical reasons. Everyone wants to pay everyone back, but have a differing opinion how it will work.30 May 01:52: Consensus seems to have been reached.

Congratulations on this epochal event. I always believed in the Bitcoin magazine and hope you succeed! I honestly don't know. Those more involved can hopefully clarify these points. Anything I say would be guesswork.I'll stop posting now. I've stated everything I know already. If that's the case then they have not told us. We had a similar problem before where they thought our issue was that we weren't using Internet Explorer/hadn't cleared our cookies. It later turned out to be a problem on their end and I had to visit a branch to reset the details.We were assured today that it should be fixed before the weekend (when the technical team is unavailable). We had to send them screenshots of the error. I attached a screenshot below. It seems like another run of the mill error (page fails to load).Compared to other banks, they are far better. HSBC and Lloyds had constant problems all the time. We would be constantly calling in to move them to fix their technical problems. We are not the normal customer as we have hundreds of transactions a day. yeah, that was a mistake on my part. No database backups. Sorry for avoiding the question.I hoped someone else could clarify this. I don't have all the full details, and would hate to make incorrect statements. I also didn't want to jeopardise efforts to refund people.From what I gather, there are no backups of the database. Only partial records for accounting which is being used to extrapolate balances. I'm not sure of the exact details, but I think they need a full view of the claims before payouts begin (like a big jigsaw puzzle) to properly cross match records. Hopefully someone better informed will post more details.zhou: ah, ok. I don't know the exact details and I'll avoid commenting further.I think Patrick assumed they were not critical hence me saying: "The assumption here was that info@bitcoinica.com did not have access to critical infrastructure.". I do appreciate that several times, you told people I wasn't involved with Bitcoinica in this thread. I always assume good faith which is why I think it was a fatal miscommunication between team members.bitcoinBullbear: that's fine. It does annoy me a little that people assume that a decentralised system like Bitcoin consists of a single piece of kosher software. bitcoin.org lists several clients. When security flaws were found, me, Mike Hearn and justmoon helped fix problems on the internal security mailing list. justmoon in fact was very instrumental in many cases for clarifying and proposing fixes for BIP 16. There was a long technical history that led to libbitcoin's creation and it has taken 8 months so far.That picture is funny. I like it.rjk, nope. Everyone had root. One person was installing a database, another installed Jenkins.The anger here is justified. If this happened to me, then I would be extremely mad. I was very pissed at MtGox when they had their problems. It sucks to be no better than MtGox.Bitcoinica took us on to help secure them.We decided it was bad practice to make sudden disruptive changes overnight to a production system. Instead the theory was a very gradual replacing of the system while observing changes. Bitcoinica was already very fragile. I still think that was a good decision.Step 1 - fix the code.Flaws were already being found in the code. That was the logical first step. That the environment ended up being exploited is simply hindsight. I would prefer not changing a working environment until after knowing how the code operates. An example is that another website accidentally made out a 500 BTC payment when the file permissions were too strict. Similarly changing an aspect of Bitcoinica without proper insight could have had grave consequences.First you understand the code. Then you run the code. You experiment with a test system. Make improvements. Deploy changes. Change production environment.The Bitcoinica plan was to do the above while creating a new platform to replace it in the long term. To the person above, here's what happened:- Bitcoinica has an internet mailing list called info@bitcoinica.com- It was the email for the website and all sensitive accounts.- You could request a password for that email. In a production system, that should never be possible.- Several people had access to this mailing list (non-admins and business people included).- Patrick got added.- His personal email was compromised. Normally this shouldn't be a big deal; I use my personal email at internet cafes and public computers.- Attacker was able to request a new password and login to rackspace.The assumption here was that info@bitcoinica.com did not have access to critical infrastructure.Lastly, it was my fault Patrick's email server got compromised. I had a VPS for programming and development which many people had access to - randoms from #c++ IRC, people from this forum, beginners I was teaching .etc It's a public VPS for development. The SSH key on there was added to Patrick's server because we were developing the bitcoinconsultancy.com website on there (that's why it's now down). My SSH key was stolen and he ssh'ed into the box. Then had access to his emails. This is so stupid and retarded.There are 2 full implementations of the Bitcoin protocol, and I wrote one from scratch in C++: https://gitorious.org/libbitcoinbitcoin-js is unmaintained, and BitCoinJava is a lightclient. I also wrote the first alternative frontend GUI: https://gitorious.org/freecoin and worked with jaromil on many freecoin improvements. I wrote most of the Wiki pages like the Getting started and PHP developer intro: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page as well as largely writing the original Bitcoin Wikipedia page. That's before I started libbitcoin as a way for developers to easily make alternative Bitcoin clients. I'm also a contributor to Electrum: https://gitorious.org/electrum/server and was one of the people (along with slush and ThomasV) to define the Stratum spec used in it. I am also responsible for the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) process: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals (see the title), and have authored 4 BIPs.What have you done?I organised the conference, and have written a plethora of articles and tutorials for the community on Bitcoin Media like this. I also helped write the initial stock exchange client for GLBSE and started many other Bitcoin projects that are defunct now but all released as OpenSource including the early version of Intersango - Britcoin. Ironically releasing the source for Britcoin hurt us as people assumed we were connected to third parties that used our software like WBX. We also hired and paid people from the community, and put our own money into growing Bitcoin (and still are). For instance, the conference lost us money and other Bitcoin projects or people we paid went nowhere. What did Patrick lie about? You can email me genjix@riseup.net if you prefer to not say here... I have a huge level of respect for Tihan because he has several times shown his honest and forth-right character. While it was unfortunate that we were muted for so long, it was needed I guess so that everyone could come to terms with what happened and make a solid action plan to move forwards rather than acting on impulse and emotion.After the Linode problem, Tihan refunded everything from his own pocket. Again after this problem, he is again putting up the money to fund Bitcoinica. To me that commands great respect. I'm really happy we are collaborating with someone that trustworthy. Now he offers to take the blame too. If that's the case, then I should equally share in the blame what with being director for Intersango.I could care less right now if everything we've worked on is in vain. The most important thing I feel is that everyone gets refunded. As a believer in transparency, honesty and openness, it feels good to have everything public now. Part of the problem was that the handover process was meant to be very gradual (it is very disruptive if you made sudden huge changes to a production system) but that there was some communication problems that allowed Bitcoinica to get compromised (things were assumed from both sides about its setup).I trust the people involved with this. I would only surround myself with trustworthy dependable people. They are going to resolve this in the best manner they can with the crappy situation that exists. It's unfortunate but must be fixed. no one cares. organised religion is stupid. personal worship of your sun god is ok, but the tribal labels are not. This is the first we have heard of this attack (on the forums just now). zhoutong did not even tell us yet. We were gradually assuming control of Bitcoinica over the last weeks by setting up a new platform.There shouldn't even be that much money in the live wallet. I'm waiting to get more information before saying more though. This is kind of ridiculous considering that already money was lost on Linode. The big question going through my head is why was that much money being stored on a Rackspace server.I am angry that our name is being dragged through the mud for something we had no part in. Market says otherwise. Intersango was free for more than a year. The day we started charging fees, our volume grew a ton. People don't trust free services. And not charging a fee hurt us in the long run due to lack of re-investment back into the platform. Oh, ok...1. Mars mission2. Free software activist mission3.

I'm doing a Bitcoin intro at c-base. If you want to do a talk, then email me (genjix@riseup.net) and I'll add you to the schedule.11th May (Friday) at 20:00http://maps.google.com/maps?q=c-base,+berlin&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=44.069599,69.082031&hq=c-base,&hnear=Berlin,+Germany&t=m&z=15U-bahn Jannowitzbrucke (1 away from Alexanderplatz) One guy posts about his dissatisfaction in one of our side businesses, and that means "something has gone seriously wrong in the organisation." How do you get from your premise to this conclusion? We are running one of the largest exchanges, operating Bitcoinica, the Bitcoin conference, developing libbitcoin/Stratum/Electrum and operating Bitcoin Media.  We're booming.I don't know the facts with this guy, but I'd examine the situation first. Surely there must be more to gusti's story - namely that he bought a VPS, which took resources to setup and he wasn't able to figure out how to use it. VPS was delivered (at least that's what I've been told). phantom doesn't post often because we're all incredibly busy. In the absence of information, don't invoke magical thinking and random speculation. http://bitcoinmedia.com/patronage-bitcoin-and-scientific-music-my-story/You all did such a great job donating to Rap News. Please support this guy! He is so amazing and I'm glad to have him as part of this community.You read on the internet about older engineers who say that James Doohan playing Scotty in Star Trek inspired them to their profession, or others saying that the inspiring Carl Sagan and his poetic love of science, inspired them to become physicists.It is because of Symphony of Science, that my sister became interested space and now studies astrophysics. She infected me with Carl Sagan, and rekindled a long held passion I held many years ago for science and introduced me to space - something I never really appreciated before in my life.I never appreciate music either - until I heard Symphony of Science. I realised then that I'd been listening to the wrong music my whole life. This music speaks to me. Think of all the people these videos are inspiring into scientific professions or just plain more logical, rational and appreciative of our world thinking. This is a huge good for society. I'd prefer not to have the reviews independent as there is a potential for abuse there. As an example: say that one day I have a falling out with MultiBit (they are great guys btw ), and so I try to show them in a bad light. Such a situation is not good for anybody.Best to find a situation which is amicable to everybody. I thought your descriptions were better written than mine for the average user, but ThomasV takes issue with some of the modifications. Fine, I can understand. Lets find those small differences and create something the antagonistic reviewer (me and you in this specific example) and the submitter (ThomasV) both agree on.Original text:Newer text:Well I think we can agree that the opening line is more concise and much better:Second sentences can both be merged perhaps:The criticism is good but maybe a bit long, so lets include that but shorten it: Well presumably that will change in the future. I think it's best to have 2 sections - 'normal' clients and 'web wallets'. Mobile clients can be bunched informally together and we can use the screenshots, platform icons and description to distinguish them. Really mobile clients are already a grey area what with touchpads running android and/or ubuntu. I kinda see them merging in the future.The only useful main distinction is whether you keep your own wallet or trust someone else. External services are always vulnerable to shut down. The Electrum-model is not a worry as several servers can be combined together, and they never have access to your wallet. The only worry is a lack of privacy which we enumerated in the description. Not to put a damper on this, but I used to play poker as my main income for 2.5 years. I've never heard of Moon Kim, and it looks like he just got lucky on one tournament:http://www.pokernews.com/news/2012/03/moon-kim-wins-2012-world-poker-tour-bay-101-shooting-star-12204.htmIf you look at the hand histories, he binked favourable cards to put him in the lead when he was behind. Like the hand where he had 44 was badly played (chasing a one card open ended) unless there was some meta game going on (which is unlikely for an amateur). So he's unlikely to get far in this event - these events usually have loads of people (especially the WPT which is a mega crowd drawer) and only the final few tables are televised.
Yep. 'Web Wallets' sounds good.I'm not sure about a mobile section since that can be represented using the platform icons; for instance Electrum has an android client - would that get another entry for mobile clients? Thanks Mike, I updated the page with your descriptions. Although I do agree that the Electrum text is inaccurate - it's not user friendly *yet*, not because its core focus is technical people. I did move MultiBit first because your reasons were solid. I can agree that Electrum has a problem with distribution (no packages, difficult/obscure install instructions for most, random win32 builds from forum). Armory is not much better in that regards, so I used a coinflip to select their order If anyone wants to test, then add this to your hosts file:176.31.24.241    bitcoin.orgFor all the complaining about centralisation on this forum, people sure seem to be fighting my efforts to promote alternative clients, to avoid promoting a strong exchange competitor by continuing to trade on MtGox and to avoid getting involved with development (bitcoin library with Python bindings is out there). We should not be pushing something because it is simply the path of least resistance, but instead pushing the hard path which is more rewarding and satisfying in the long run - a truly decentralised cryptocurrency which is free from control and corruption.This is the end goal of bitcoin.org:http://bittorrent.org/BitTorrent is what I would call a decentralised piece of software driven by merit. The BitTorrent client marketplace is highly competitive and diverse.Here's the front page:Clients page: Sure, can you give me a 250x200 picture, a 400 char max description and the website? Please keep the description neutral sounding and focused. I didn't put it because I don't own a phone and haven't tried Paytunia nor kept up with mobile developments  Not because of any political thing.BTW if you want to write a BitcoinMedia about it then give me an email.Two questions: is it open-source? Does it store people's keys (wallet) locally on the device? OK, I'll try to respond to commentsDone.The front page recommends Bitcoin-Qt and offers it as download (like currently on bitcoin.org).This is FUD. Electrum relies on libbitcoin which is BIP16 compliant and handles blockchain reorgs fine. Armory depends on bitcoind. MultiBit is based on BitCoinJ which is well tested in many clients and more than 1 year old.Yeah, I agree with this. Also it's too restrictive a format for projects. There's no meaningful way to compare them really. I think name, pic, website, description is best.Descriptions aren't final. They are just temporary place-holders. People would submit their own after. This is just pedantry.Redundant.Changed this to 'Bitcoin Client Software'http://bittorrent.org/I'm strongly against terms like "official" and prefer "recommended". Who designates the designations. It is against the spirit of a decentralised software to have terms like "official".If you're worried about usability then figure that most new users are not downloading a client but using services like InstaWallet or an actual wallet website.I'm not familiar with this space so I didn't add them. Best to add them after. Both have their pros and cons. The vertical list allows bigger images and more text. Second one is more conducive to easy reading (less horizontal scanning and descriptions are shorter).Thx for reading GCC 4.7 has a bug in it. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4940259/c11-lambdas-require-capturing-this-to-call-static-member-functionI need to get around to installing that compiler and adding a workaround for that.

Broke artists dressed in drag making rap videos invest in bitcoin? They are begging for donations. I hardly think of them as an investor. No, the message they give out for the minimal cost they accrue (supported by voluntary patronage) is fantastic! I'm super happy they are making such high quality videos for really cheap AND accepting bitcoins.Or would you prefer them to sing about Celebrity and Starbucks and instead those bitcoin donations they got, instead go towards speculation on MtGox and paying MagicalTux's debt (which he still hasn't paid back to many). I think this is a great use of bitcoins (funding culture and the internet), and the main reason I got into it. It demonstrates to an outside audience that bitcoin is more than drugs, paedophiles, money laundering and organised crime. Bitcoin is world changing, and Juice Rap New's lyrics echo the world changing sentiments of these times.I cannot think of a better use for bitcoins possible now. Sure, good idea. I changed their article. Damn, you people are fast. Maybe the OP wants to update with their statement:http://bitcoinmedia.com/juice-rap-news-joins-bitcoins-struggle/I contacted them a year ago about Bitcoin & Free (as in Freedom!) OpenSource Software, and sending them emails about all these things every so often. I wanted them to mention OpenSource Software in one of their videos since it's related & cool (people around the world joining together to build gigantic systems).They messaged me a few days ago about Bitcoin, saying that I wasn't the only one bugging them  Niiice. Bitcoin Media: Juice Rap News joins Bitcoins struggle"Juice Rap News relies heavily on viewer support and is fortunate to receive donations from people all around the world  it helps us to remain completely independent.Most donations, however, come to us via PayPal (booo), and since the illegal banking blockade on WikiLeaks, in which PayPal still participates, we have become more and more uncomfortable with this situation. Over the past year we have also been receiving regular and sometimes rather insistent emails asking why on earth we were not accepting Bitcoin donations. (Do you accept them?! If not, will you?  is one of the latest)."By Giordano & Hugo (JuiceRapNews) Bitcoin Media: The Brave New World of Mobile Payment"The recent MobileMoneyAfrica Summit showed impressively just how far ahead Africa is compared to the developed world when it comes to mobile payment. Of necessity, of course: Mobile phones are ubiquitous there, but only a minority of Africans hold a bank account. There are already serious efforts under way to create a truly cashless society. Very predictably, many western companies are rushing in to partake in this market. Most successful so far is Vodafones implementation, called M-Pesa."By Ruediger Koch (anu) http://bitcoinmedia.com/irans-dire-straits/ We found a trendy upscale loft which looked cool  but not so much of a conference venue, more for private parties for celebrities.We want to get a place for 500, but it's difficult finding for that range. Most venues are 200, then a few 300, a huge gap and then places for 2000+ (big warehouses). Still gotta keeps searching and find somewhere nice. So your bank is being cautious.
Hey DrG and boognish!Update: I went to see that specialist, and took him DrG's write-up.The orthopaedic specialist said your write-up was very good and he agrees with your approach (cautious skepticism regarding surgery, treatment plan, 2 different injuries).He did some physical tests and told me that the first injury from my wrestling days is probably a chipped piece of cartilage, or possibly a fracture. The chipped piece of cartilage is stopping my arm fully extending by 1-2cm compared with my right arm. I had an x-ray and go back in 2 weeks to see about that. He said that if it is a chipped piece of cartilage then it is probably not a good idea to operate (since it would have healed over during these 4 years), and the way forwards is with physical therapy. Surgery is a last resort.When I banged my elbow 1 year ago, he says this is scholars elbow and that the tingling/aching I feel, is where the nerve is regenerating itself. And that nerve damage takes a *really really* long time to heal.I think it is this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olecranon_bursitis (not sure)Overall I'm really happy! Could've been worse! Feel free to chip in with your own diagnostics doctors. Just putting this out there so everyone can see you're the real deal and did such a good job. The specialist liked your write-up. I stopped twice while reading it, but he asked for the whole thing and said it was good.Keep it up! This is the future and you are doing good by providing people with easy access medicine. Of course, an online doctor is not a replacement for a real specialist, but it is a good supplement that can only help make people more healthier if used in a correct ethical manner.Hugs & kisses,Genjix Mi skribis multajn bonajn artikolojn kaj tiuj kiuj sukcesigxis aspekti esti sen skemo.

Bitmono estas firm-nomo, ne nomo por abstrakta ideo. Tamen algoritmo malsimplas, sed mi ne konas pli bonan vorton. I like it. Has good flow and stuff. Just needs better production values is all. So why algorithmic money? Why not crypto-currency or p2p money?Well...p2p is an old buzzword, and one used by bittorrent though. I even heard my bank manager call their bank accounts peer to peer. It's a common finance term now.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_bankingcrypto sounds shady to most people. Like crypto-jews or crypto-nazis. People who want to hide things. Also technically DigiCash was a crypto-currency (and centralised). Bitcoin's defining feature it uses code to self regulate in a decentralised manner without an authority.emoney, internet money or digital cash sounds like paypal. Not at all new or interesting.Algorithm is a neutral word.

I want to make a week long hackathon of intense coding! I mean if all these cool people fly from the US, it would a waste for them not to stick around! Anyway, we'll have to see and this is something I'll try to setup nearer the date in my spare time (not part of the official conference). Maybe we could pool funds together to rent out a hall and throw down sleeping bags or something. I'll also check with LHS once we confirm the date for the conference. http://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/blobs/master/src/network/handshake.cpp I think slush doesn't have much time. Anyway, I'll pick up the slack. I'm working off slush's original proposal, but need to make some design decisions in coordination with ThomasV.I'll only focus on two use-cases:- Merchants- Users We are in London = higher quality conference. That's all that matters to me. Build the highest quality schedule and topics. Bring together the best and brightest.Our organisation's (Bitcoin Consultancy) mission statement is:"In April 2011, we formed this consultancy as a collaborative effort to take bitcoin outside the world of tech geeks and hobbyists into the real world."This conference's mandate is:"To bring bitcoin to a global financial centre, and be a turning point bringing bitcoin to the fore of the mainstream. It is here that bitcoin will leave its perilous infancy, as the new world briefly meets the old before displacing it."If you notice the actions of our group, everything is aligned with these statements. From our outreach (Bitcoin Media), to the exchange (Intersango to spread BTC) and our development (libbitcoin to enable people to build lots of bitcoin applications). This conference will be no different, and you will see it designed accordingly. We want to grow bitcoin through the vehicle of this conference. It will be a serious pensive arrangement with deep discussions, not a fun-community weekend piss-up.London is our avenue for doing that. For building the best conference, we are here and have our support network here. It is where we can best perform. Berlin is foreign unfamiliar non-English speaking territory for us. It's not like to create a conference you just rent out a church hall and throw some plastic chairs in. There is a lot of micromanagement and behind the scenes organisation.And saying you boycott us until you get a sunnier location of your choosing, when this is our highest quality offering is simply childish and ungrateful. I'm not getting paid working 14 hour days, and the rest of my group is also overworked and underpaid. We are in this because we are lovers of bitcoin (and opensource in my case ). And you want to punish us? Come on, I know you're above that as a human being. I'm clearly in league Rothschilds, Free Masons and CIA.So it's not Al Qaeda anymore.Moving up in the world. PID controllers are hard to tune. I like bitcoin's simplicity Ne  Mi posedas Intersango (de la vorto intersxangxi)

We had David Birch at last years European Bitcoin Conference:http://bitcoinmedia.com/eurobit-david-birch-next-generation-money/Not sure why Adrianne Jeffries is talking about bitcoin though. She's a journalist, not a payments expert and some of her writings have been wrong or shown a deep lack of understanding about bitcoin and the community.David Birch is actually a payments consultant for the conventional banking industry. So when you hear him speak, you know this is the current conventional wisdom in those circles.

If he can raise funds without selling himself out or sacrificing quality, why then that's awesome. Yeah, the logic of the two marketplaces is completely different.In the commercial marketplace, you would not work for free. Nobody would work at Walmart helping customers or stack shelves for free. You'd be a chump! The logic is that you do stuff for money.Yet you get all these people on Wikipedia. Volunteers. Who do sometimes insanely tedious work. Why? No one knows. But that's the norms of the community marketplace. The logic of this space, is that of the community. A love of what you do.Welcome to the new age of peer production. Hah!

I am in the UK, so our health care is free (luckily), otherwise I wouldn't be able to afford a specialist.Scary stuff. I will go tomorrow right away with your message and demand a specialist from my GP. You probably saved my health a great deal otherwise I would definitely have put this off for longer.

Have you got an IP address I can connect to your bitcoind? It could be that you're running an old version of bitcoin (the version packet has changed since older versions). If that's the case then trying the latest should work.I'm on Skype as zgenjix or Freenode IRC in #bitcoinconsultancy as genjixRing ring, live support.

[libbitcoin] First 500 blockslibbitcoin is a toolkit based library and can be leveraged with different design patterns depending on the task or application.

I'm using boost built to a local directory.The library is still early. These dependencies will all become standard and part of Linux distributions within a few months. It's a worthwhile gamble since they add significant quality to the library.I would stay away from the packages for the time being. Once I make a 1.0 release this month then I will update them.If anyone manages to get it to build, then build instructions would be much appreciated. I wrote these:https://bitcoinconsultancy.com/wiki/Build_libbitcoinoff the top of my head. I don't have a clean environment around to test, and I'm also very stressed for time what with the exchange, bitcoin media, libbitcoin and bitcoin conference requirements. I'm trying to devote 80% of my time on this library so it means I have to be really efficient with my time.Also there's a new tutorial I will post below! Warning: BTC-E compromisedI have identified a critical flaw on BTC-E that allows unhindered access to accounts. I recommend people to stop all trading on BTC-E now.By Patrick Strateman (phantomcircuit)Fear and loathing in Bitcoin world, why is there so much volatility?As most everyone already knows by now, some currencies are more volatile than others. The volatility comes from out-of-balance market actions. That is, during some precisely defined window of time, there are more people wanting to sell than there are potential buyers, and vice versa. Sometimes these imbalances are exaggerated, which then manifests as rapid decline or appreciation of exchange rates of said currency.By Topi Kanerva (topi)Bitcoinica Legal Complaintparapipan has filed a legal complaint against the Spanish authorities.

OK, here goes.I'm now around 25. When I was younger I used to do lots of sports (boxing, judo, ...). Around 20, when I was wrestling, my arm got overextended and there was a loud 'crunch' sound. The guy doing it with me immediately stopped because he heard the noise. It was really loud krrrrnch sound. I didn't feel anything (adrenaline) so kept at it for the rest of the session.After the session, there was immediately intense pain. I went straight to emergency and saw a nurse. She told me my arm was sprained. Looking back now, I know that was stupid (I know what a sprain feels like) but I didn't protest it and said whatever (assuming that it would go away eventually). During that week my arm could not be used. It eventually stopped aching.From then on, I stopped exercising because whenever I would put pressure on that arm, I would get a dull ache.Anyway fast forward to 1 year ago in Amsterdam. I was at some hotel and banged my elbow. the edge of the door frame hit the soft spot in between my elbow joint and there was a sudden shooting pain. Ever since then my arm was aching and sometimes I get tingling in my fingers.I went to see a doctor when I was in Poland at the ER (4 months ago). He said it is a soft tissue damage and I need to rest my arm (I don't do anything anyway). I asked him what the best position is, and he said to keep it at a 90 deg angle (bent) rather than straight. If it didn't heal I should see another doctor in 2 weeks time. He told me it likely won't heal quickly (soft tissue damage takes a long time to heal) or maybe not at all, and there isn't much they can do about it.It doesn't hurt. It just aches or sometimes I get a bit of tingling (which is worrying). I've put off seeing the doctor because I'm under a huge amount of stress for time (which is affecting my health, but OK I am having fun). It seems to be getting better, but I could be wrong since it alternates between periods of being fine, to periods of aching.Using the arm in a funny way (weird twisted angle) or putting pressure on it (lifting heavy things) are not good, so I avoid those activities. It's a dull/slow ongoing ache. https://bitcoinconsultancy.com/wiki/Build_libbitcoinYour g++ is outdated.@znort, try google-protobuf or something. And dont use the boost headers in ubuntu... they are missing async_connect function. Use 1.48 from boostr website as per instructions above.@Dusty, sure. Use the network component to connect to a bitcoin node, then fashion a get_data packet. Send it to the node and subscribe to either transactions or blocks. Then once you received the block and/or tx, create an exporter object to serialise them and print the bytes to the screen. Hopefully I can get this next tutorial out soon, and it will clarify some points for you. Just been very busy this week with exchange stuff :/ Constantly stressed for time As paraipan runs a business with competing interests, his legal filing is of dubious legality. This is termed conflict of interest. His role as a competing business has the potential to possibly corrupt his other acts in this area. Legally he has no role in this area. He is not a customer.http://bitcoinmedia.com/bitcoinica-legal-complaint/It does not matter. You're in a legally grey area by using the law in this way. And in a highly unethical way too. Anyone who does business with this guy would be highly unethical. He has used the law (which exists to protect customers) as a commercial weapon. He has a conflict of interest. It is when companies (and large corporations) use the law in this manner that a society becomes corrupt. This guy is a promoter of corruption.http://bitcoinmedia.com/bitcoinica-legal-complaint/

Even this thread I was worried might be spammy but the moderators told me it was fine. This is a cool story. This guy went around African embassies to promote Bitcoin:Our next adoption phaseMuch has been talked about the early adopter advantage while in fact we are not even in that stage yet. Were at the beginning of the innovator stage in the technology adoption lifecycle now. The early adopter phase is next. So we still have some say in who those future early adopters are going to be who are going to realize the early adopter advantage. I argue that the early adopters should be some of those who so far have been systematically disadvantaged, specifically people of small, poor nations, many of which can be found on the African continent. well the iranian government doesnt give a fuck. the point of the sanctions is to make the people angry enough to overthrow their government:http://bitcoinmedia.com/irans-dire-straits/im of the opinion that the government is already too brutal and people would overthrow them if they could. that instead it just makes people weak, shut-off and easier to repress. Electrum 0.38  aliases and signed URIsElectrum is a lightweight client written in Python. The design is an improvement over Bitcoin-Qt because the user interface and core code are split into a client and a server. This means you can run an Electrum server instance, and use the same bitcoin from a wide variety of devices. Server instances are analogous to email servers, and the Electrum client with email clients.BBC 5 live investigates Silk Road and BitcoinsI wish more Bitcoin proponents would embrace the Silk Road, and what it stands for, as a positive social force; both for Bitcoins growth and success, but also more generally as a new tool for the safe disobedience of unjust laws. Instead it seems they more often try to downplay the size and influence of Silk Road (falsely too), in an attempt to distance themselves, and the rest of the Bitcoin community, from the illegal activity going on. This is a strategy from Bitcoiners that I honestly dont understand.Tim Schafer raised $800,000 in 24 hoursTim Schafer is a legend within the game designers community.

In particular his use of level design for gameplay elements and well written dialogue make his work an example to follow for budding game designers. Sorry you feel that way, but 3 days is totally usual for bank withdrawals in the UK. For example PokerStars takes 3-5 business days for withdrawals. I know CryptoXChange is a competing exchange us, but you deposited with the wrong code, and it has just been a weekend. I would give them a message on IRC- I suspect they have to do these kinds of transfers manually (maybe a couple of people have to be around and free to authorise this) so it slipped through the cracks.It's best to go through proper support channels rather than emailing the CEO personally. Lots of people sending me forum PMs, emails, IRC messages, Skype messages, telephone calls and I keep telling people to email support - if it is not in one place, then your message may get lost. Especially when me and Ken are not a support people.EDIT: I'm not from CryptoXChange. I'm genjix / Amir Taaki from Intersango. They were already done today so not sure what this post is about. If you did not receive your payment then email support@intersango.com Facebook privacyCritics of bitcoin ask why privacy is important. An ongoing discussion about the role of personal privacy in digital contexts polarises. It is a debate that will forever change the fabric of our shared online culture. I had this idea too. It would encourage people to trade more, and encourage people to hold bitcoins. I'm going to ask the others why they decided against this (can't remember). We will be switching to a new bank soon. Banking with Lloyds is not a sustainable situation. We have 2 bank accounts ready, and we're going to go ahead with those. The Lloyds account will be closed by the end of this month. More details once I know more. I think Bitcoin Media is the correct avenue for that:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=62849.0 That's exactly how it's done. Every morning I get up, type in my PIN on a card reader to get 10 PIN numbers which I give the CTO.As for withdrawals, some banks allow you to upload Xml whereas other banks (UK banks are the worst banks) you have to have some javascript and a person pasting it into the address bar, then enter a pin after every xfer. With 2 people, it can be done really efficiently and do a few hundred in a couple of hours. One person presses enter, alt-tab to browser, F6, ctrl-a, paste, enter, type in pin, press enter, repeat. The other person is checking for errors and giving the pin codes. We could have it more automated, but that's risky and more effort because the banks like to change small details with their site every so often.UK banks:- High overhead.- Difficult to keep open.- Lengthy/poor service & interface.- Time consuming (spend so much time dealing with UK banks- by contrast EU bank has never caused us a problem).There are no UK banks with an API. They deliberately hide the API for security reasons (security through obscurity). UK banks are socialist organisations and ridiculously inefficient- a bit of a joke for one of the financial centres of the world! Hey,Bitcoin Media has 3 aims:- Grow bitcoin. This means encouraging 'mainstream' uses of bitcoin to legitimise the economy. Particular exciting new things only bitcoin can be used for.- Decentralise the network by promoting alternative client softwares, exchanges, pools and services.- Spread the knowledge. Our group (Bitcoin Consultancy) has a ton of knowledge just from day to day living in bitcoin on legal, technical, finance .etc Small things that if they aren't written down will go extinct.I'm looking for people who want to write about things they are doing- bitcoin businesses, services or interesting projects.- Should be something tangible that exists. I don't like big statements and hand waving about vapour-ware.- Cool things.If you register on Bitcoin Media then email me (email is on the about page) your username then I'll make you a submitter so you can write articles. Please non-spammy articles! Talk about why you or running the service, why you believe in bitcoin and what you exist for. Want to hear about the spirit, adversity and things you learnt from your projects. Not just a bullet list why your X is better than their Y. Catherine is a fan of bitcoin, and she was innocently asking a question. What I took for her talk was about what our individual decisions should be and how they influence bitcoin's development. We don't exist in a bubble, and our individual ethical decisions help push bitcoin as a cause for good.She wasn't arguing in favour of an authority. Not at all.BTW is Irdial lonelyminer? He should email me if he wants to write an article. Or anyone for that matter.My reply there:-----------------------You make a good point, and I can totally understand what youre saying. But ethics is more than being good. Ethics is about helping good people make good decisions when the best decision isnt always clear.There are hundreds of small ethical decisions everyday that build up to outcomes. Catherine wasnt talking about bitcoins anthropomorphic morality, but about the people driving bitcoin forwards. The community.There are many small decisions now about bitcoins future that can have massive future ramifications if bitcoin becomes big. Computing, the internet and web itself are an empowering tool simply because of those early engineers who had the prescience to design it that way, understanding the future impact such tools would have.Their ethical decisions are a gift to us today. And a valuable and humbling example to follow.

This talk needs more love! I think what you guys are doing is fantastic. BitTalk.TV Stefan Thomas interviewStefan Thomas discusses bitcoins direction. There are many big speakers in the community, but Stefan is an actual developer having contributed a useful library that has enabled several interesting sites and wallets to exist. He understands the protocol and core code. And the bitcoin introduction video on the WeUseCoins website. Red Emerald:As the codebase matures I'll start adding a ton of comments. The thing I hate more than uncommented code is out of date comments.I'm collaborating with the SFLC/FSF to sort that out. They resolved a bunch of licensing issues for me already.First tutorial (of many) is written. Just a high level overview. Next one should have some code, and then we'll go back and break everything down as we go along.[libbitcoin] Overviewlibbitcoin is a bitcoin library targeted towards high end use. The library places a heavy focus around asychronicity. The enables a big scope for future scalability as each component has its own thread pool. By increasing the number of threads for that component the library is able to scale outwards across CPU cores. This will be vital in the future as the demands of the bitcoin network grow.I tried to explain the design principles behind libbitcoin and why things are done how they are. A little bit of a techy article/tutorial:[libbitcoin] Overviewlibbitcoin is a bitcoin library targeted towards high end use. The library places a heavy focus around asychronicity.

Actually there is. I pointed this out to Gavin months ago in private chat but he disagreed with me. I still don't think the change was a good one. You don't comment out 2 lines of code because it produces a 6 hour speedup. The proper way is to restructure the code nicely but that takes more effort. OK, I'm getting ready to finalise a 1.0 release by the end of this month (Feb).License will now be Lesser AGPL. You can link and use libbitcoin in your closed source project, but the changes you make to libbitcoin must be public. I will give explicit permission through email to people 'myusername'@riseup.net (signed with my GPG key) if you want to be sure.Will be heavily documenting and writing tutorials soon.On the development front:- I have written a blockchain fuzzer which I will use to stress test the blockchain algorithm.- Node discovery needs to be completed (should be easy- the tricky part is designing a good API).- A high level synchronous interface for easy programming and integration of bitcoin in your project. This might not make it to 1.0 release. fellowtraveler, this is what you're asking for.Right now the project is still rough around the edges, but it is rapidly approaching production capability in a rough way. We will have to smooth out some things while using it and the API may change a lot early on. I will also be making a test client as a proof of concept in order to perfect the API better.libbitcoin requires advanced C++ knowledge (for now). It is heavily built around asynchronous interfaces and the library is thread safe. An understanding of thread contexts is required but I'll document this in the tutorials. We just released another video from the conference [eurobit] Rick Falkvinge  Banks: The Fourth Victim of Citizens empowermentFalkvinge compares past examples of technology adoption like email and the postal service, eventually drawing parallels with bitcoin and the banks. Email was largely ignored in the beginning by the postal industry because it was not a competitor. Cyber revolt!You got up, you worked, you slept, you died. Loyalties were to our immediate family, maybe our community. Work was only a means to provide for your family. Your ecology might only be your town (villages by todays standards). Tribal or national boundaries were strong as a foreigner was strange. Unusual. Not a common occurence. Nope. Bitcoin is not a team. It is many teams in a community and part of a process. In project development, relationships aren't always and sometimes shouldn't be cordial.For instance a regulator and the company they are overseeing, should not have a cordial relationship. Or upstream and downstream if they are functioning properly will have a contentious relationship; I've had some vicious past arguments with downstream before but we remained amicable and professional while disagreeing.http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Staying_close_to_upstream_projects#Tips_On_Upstreaming_PatchesMany of the characterisations I see people making all the time comparing bitcoin to a business, a team or charity (to name a few) are unrealistically simple and naive.

I strongly agree and support theymos' proposal:http://bitcoinmedia.com/cathartic-progress/I propose theymos as the organiser. The organiser will be entrusted with running the system to take the votes. They will organise the platforms and structure the discussions to promote neutrality.theymos is a trusted long-term member of the community. His running of blockexplorer qualifies him technically; he is intimate with the code and issues. He has demonstrated a neutral objective character as the moderator of the bitcointalk forums. I think he's a good choice here.
My stance:http://bitcoinmedia.com/cathartic-progress/Michael Marquardt (theymos) suggests compiling a list of everyone intimate with the bitcoin protocol to invite to a two-week email discussion. After those two-weeks a vote is taken. It will be the job of the champions of each idea (BIP 16, BIP 17 and no change) to win over the committee into supporting them. If an idea has necessary support, bitcoin clients will be programmed to apply the new rules for 3 months in the future. Here is the list of developers i contacted for feedback before publishing:- justmoon- jgarzik- gavin- roconnor- gmaxwell- sipa- wladimir- Mike Hearn- luke-jrI got help with copy-editing and feedback from the following people:- luke-jr- justmoon- tcatmNotes:- I was directly involved with the development of BIP 0016- I wrote an article trying to present the facts. it was exhausting and took a lot of time so there may be some slip ups, errors or bad phrasing, but i want to inform the users and put out truth. I don't appreciate general hand waving trashing the article, i do appreciate constructive criticism about how to reword paragraphs or change sections to be more accurate.- Went to great effort to make that article factually accurate, neutral, fair and balanced.- Have no preference for BIP 16, BIP 17 or none. I will implement whatever comes along. Others have been thinking this over far longer than me.- I asked the developers before asking them to write an article. Nobody seemed interested so I took on the task.- Will definitely publish an article challenging mine from another developer.I am not sure what has changed since this time and I am not sure why you did not bring to my attention what you feel is 'overt misinformation' in the article before hand. If there is something worth editing I will certainly consider it even now. I know you have helped a lot and I really have appreciated your efforts and the leaking of those documents before. I know you're a good guy, but lets talk through this more amicably without the attacks.I run the BIP standardisation process and it is my responsibility to ensure that a BIP gets adequate discussion and approval before becoming a standard. This is the wrong attitude that I am campaigning against. Ideas should be selected based on technical merit, not the people behind them. And Luke's idea is technically sound.Bitcoin is not a business either, it is a system and a community. Having authorities start banning individuals is fascist. http://bitcoinmedia.com/the-truth-behind-bip-16-and-17/Now I am not usually posting (spamming) Bitcoin Media stories on the forum, but I feel this is an important read. All the posts I've seen thus far are by partisan supporters of either scheme with no objectivity. They've also been highly technical in their language whereas here I've put mucho effort to make it readable and understandable for non-bitcoin developers.Other developers disagree with giving this information away and feel like you as users should trust their judgement. I strongly disagree. I'd rather people have a say in such fundamental matters such as this, even if it makes the developer's lives harder because they have to explain their decisions thoroughly.My worry is bitcoin someday becomes corrupted. Developers: see this extra scrutiny as an opportunity to build a culture of openness. It is not at all bad.EDIT:http://bitcoinmedia.com/cathartic-progress/Michael Marquardt (theymos) suggests compiling a list of everyone intimate with the bitcoin protocol to invite to a two-week email discussion.

These changes are a huge fundamental change to the bitcoin protocol, and it is a bad idea for people to be treating such a serious topic like a popularity contest.Far better would be if you closed this thread, researched the topic a bit and then make a post with a balanced summary of all the viewpoints. Like this you are encouraging everyone to pick and choose based on social proof or popularity.And I am totally neutral on this topic. The reason I closed it down was because Gavin works for the CIA, and I wanted to shut down all the dissenters. The BIP process is so that we can scheme together, make it BIP law then force everyone to comply.Occam's razor. http://breakthruradio.com/#/post/?blog=72&post=9774 "Yesterday, Betabeat pointed out that Silk Road still exists..."( http://www.betabeat.com/2012/01/26/eight-months-after-sen-chuck-schumer-blasted-bitcoin-silk-road-is-still-booming/ )my face when betabeat gets all the credit and 72 upvotes for carbon copying my bitcoinmedia article and i got 10 upvotes on reddit :[lameHere's the original work http://bitcoinmedia.com/thank-you-schumer/Bitcoin Media articles have been on Slashdot 3 times, and they have everytime linked the original article and mentioned the author's name. idk maybe I shouldn't care.

Therefore important that I get a big picture look rather than a small circlejerk of friends preaching to each other  The bank account is now operational. Apologies for the delay this week. It was a technical error on the side of the bank and has been fixed.Deposits and withdrawals from this week have been completed.I think a bunch of banks have experienced technical faults this week and it may be worth your time to inquire as you might be viable for compensation. A friend told me this:Details of the technical error:In the UK there are 3 payment types between banks called BACS, FPS and CHAPS. CHAPS is for high end payments (like moving a million or more) so we will ignore that. BACS is the old transfer type and usually takes 5 working business days. FPS is a newer government mandated inter-bank standard that makes payments within 1-2 business days but usually within a few hours.A payment within the same bank is a transfer (TFR) so we'll ignore that.The UK government has mandated that all banks have to move to FPS by the end of this year (IIRC), and has given optional guidelines to the banks. Lloyds probably disabled BACS from a whole bunch of accounts including Intersango's account (Interteni).We had a few BACS payments which caused some problems for them when they did the migration (due to our transaction volume it might have been tricky). This is what they meant when our transactions have caused a problem in the processing queue. That we had submitted payments using BACS from our account, then BACS was disabled from our account but they still had the payments to be processed on the queue which caused an error.BACS transfers no longer exist for Intersango. Most banks should have them deprecated now. This should not affect the majority of users and we have emailed the affected individuals. OK, we found out the problem with the bank.In the UK there are 3 payment types between banks called BACS, FPS and CHAPS.

I hope I am wrong, but...There are auction sites on the internet that sell crap stuff that nobody ever wants and they are just a front for money laundering. If anyone ever inquires then they claim to be a legit business. The fact that this site is able to offer such a wide variety of goods (which probably don't exist) for such huge prices screams at me that this is a crook job.This doesn't bode well for bitcoin.EDIT: ThomasV is right. I'll stop spreading FUD. The bank account is now operational. Apologies for the delay this week.

A friend told me this: Iran is a bad choice right now,http://bitcoinmedia.com/irans-dire-straits/However Iran is not signatory to the Berne convention (WIPO treaty) and doesn't have copyright. But yeah there's bigger problems there right now. Economy is about to collapse soon. Of course it's politically motivated,http://bitcoinmedia.com/megaupload-conspiracy/ http://bitcoinmedia.com/megaupload-conspiracy/< MC1984> charges of distributing child prn and terrorist materials are in the megaupload charges apparantly< MC1984> 76 page indictment< MC1984> they just throw cp and terrorism in thereThe 4 horsemen of the Infocalypse:Child pornTerrorismMoney launderingDrugsThose are things they use to attack the net. I would also add piracy to that list. Stupid. (I'm from Intersango)Our bank claims the processing queue has been filled because of our large order volume and they have to fix the technical issue which rarely happens. It is uncertain what they are up to- we did have smaller incidents in the past which were our account being flagged, and then one incident where they were being highly secretive and uncommunicative. Now they are talking to us but it seems to take time.We have a face to face meeting with me, our director, our lawyer, and the bank's business manager and our bank account's relationship manager on the 26 Jan. Hopefully there something will be resolved and I will know more.Apologies about the slower than usual support tickets- this comes at an unfortunate time for us when a) we are restructuring as a company internally b) meetings with investors all this week and c) the team is in various places for various reasons. We will be hiring new support staff by the end of this month to handle more of the tickets.Anyway that's the best I can give you.About the small wires: yes that is the reason, and that many people try to make fraudulent payments that get bounced. This makes any bitcoin account look suspicious. The small wires from many different unknown accounts are highly unusual from a bank's perspective. Our daily transaction volume is a few months transaction volume for the average bank customer. Agree with guy above.The spam was terribly ugly looking, annoying to people interested in bitcoin news and counter-productive to the cause of bitcoin making it look like a scam because of spammy adds.Twitter did the right thing. That spam made Twitter unusable for me, and I haven't been using it.
Been getting messages like this all day:"The Bitcoin Consultancy was contracted (paid) by TheGlobber (Antonios Metaxiotis) to develop RealCoin."Which part of this isn't obvious? We are a software development house focusing around bitcoin and crypto-currencies. This is what we do. I guarantee the software is solid. That is all. Haha! Soooo flippant. http://bitcoinmedia.com/ We made a song for it (see page) Intersango wanted to do a blackout too, but we couldn't because:- Our legal policy is that we give 5 days notice of any downtime.- Site changes have to be tested. Changing the code for an exchange is not a light matter. Well more than 90% of people support a banner or more. You can only mine using the official client on your CPU. The exact mechanism how this is done is kept secret for the time being and is pretty difficult to reverse engineer.

We can guarantee that there is no malicious code in there to steal your funds. We have made a number of changes inside the system's functioning internally - block validation is different and mining uses a different algorithm. There are also some minor changes to the GUI and JSON-RPC interface.However we are not lobbying for people to invest in any crypto-currency, and that includes Bitcoin. We never advocate for people to invest significant resources in these relatively experimental and volatile commodities. Instead I advise people to do their own research and make their own decisions. Invest only small amounts you can afford to lose and spread the love! Caveat emptor. genjix and phantomcircuit are both from https://bitcoinconsultancy.com/ (Which is a development house)Projects from that group:https://intersango.com/http://bitcoinmedia.com/http://bitgroups.org/ (European Bitcoin Conference)http://vibanko.com/libbitcoin: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30646.0subvertx: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50721.0GLBSE client: https://gitorious.org/+bitcoin-consultancy-dev/black-market/black-market-clientWe as a group do lots of experimental projects. There are some failed experiments which aren't public. The successful ones make it to an incubator and turn public (Intersango, ViBanko). We also do various projects for clients (doing an alternate chain now for a person) and then use that money to fund more people to work on bitcoin projects. At the moment we are a fulltime team of 5 self-employed via Bitcoin Consultancy: finance person, lawyer and developers.Some older projects:- Wrote most of the bitcoin wiki- Freecoin: http://gitorious.org/freecoin- Spesmilo: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Spesmilo- Britcoin (old UK exchange. Source: http://gitorious.org/intersango )- PostEconomy, which was a site for putting bounties and funding developers to work on bitcoin (in some ways the precursor to our group ) Nothing will happen unless you make some noise. Are you behind a blackout? SOPA/PIPA has ramifications to hurt bitcoin in a huge way. I myself am from the UK and US law affects me.Below is the conversation so far on the bitcoin development mailing list.---------------Amir Taaki:How is this not the most important world issue right now?EVERYTHING is under threat.

This is an issue that affects bitcoin directly.Wikipedia has far more need to remain neutral and apolitical than bitcoin ever does- you've read Satoshi's politically charged whitepaper or seen the genesis block quote.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative/ActionThe Wikipedia community decided on a full and global blackout. Bitcoin should do the same in unison with the rest of the web- sites like Reddit, 4chan and Wikipedia.It's funny / almost comical how you consign this to being just another issue or case of moral alarm.

This isn't completely realistic but it works for our model.S = subsidy (or sum of fees)C = electricity costC - S -> 0 - deltaI put a negative delta there, because people make bad bets all the time. I was invited to talk about copyright, free software and the internet because of that article I wrote and my work in free software. It was not about bitcoin and I was not there representing bitcoin.Also:462 likes, 14 dislikesHaters gonna hate BTWThe time is very short. you can only talk about one thing really so i decided to emphasise the importance, the grandness and inspiring empowerment.If people want facts and info... the internet is there.If you can choose between the 2, the former is always better.

They are interested in bitcoin to help them with their drug trafficking operations.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_drug_trafficking This is showing tomorrow. Just checking if Yankee can still do it. Glad you all liked it  Here's the article we were talking about: http://bitcoinmedia.com/the-future-cannot-exist-without-the-past/ The cacophony of technologyJanuary 3, 2012By Amir Taaki (genjix)A solitary planet circling a star begins to stir. On the surface, life begins to form. A kaleidoscope of species emerges, culminating in evolutions magnum opus; intelligence.And then technology is invented. In a flash, they create planetary scale artifices. They adapt the environment to themselves, instead of being forced to adapt to their surroundings as they once did. They dream of grand cosmic conspiracies and futures, and safely pass their perilous infancy.Others, not so lucky or prudent, perish.This may be a common pattern in the universe, and explains why life is uncommon. That life develops high technology and then in a flash, promptly wipes themselves out. A glimmer of brilliance before the long enveloping dark. Billions of years wasted because of unforgiveable carelessness.We stand at a unique vantage point in the history of our species, the history of all species and the history of our planet. We face dangers to ourselves, and everything around us. We are living through an anthropogenic extinction epoch 10,000 times greater than anything since the meteor that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Nation states play a shrewd game of chicken with nuclear weapons, probing the other sides weaknesses. We have constructed a false economy based on greed and lies.Its as if we are standing waist deep in petrol with a match in one hand, in a deadly doctrine of deterrence. Our ignorance, endangers our future.The timescale for change is not millenia or even centuries, but decades or even years.This will involve changes in government, industry, ethics, economics and religion. Weve never attempted such an undertaking before. At least not on a planetary distance.And it may be too difficult. Better to stay at home, they say. Or that large changes are deemed impractical or impossible- as if destruction is practical! The right change may not happen. There may be too many quarrels between nations, ethnicities and politics. Corruption may be too endemic.But we humans have a history of overcoming adversity and rapid change. Were an adaptable species that aspires; sometimes dreams of the impossible well outside our means- and then reaches them! We have pulled together to explore new lands and new worlds, and have overcome diversity. Or defeated a common enemy.And a new emerging economy. It started with software, but has expanded beyond its humble origins. The bazaar of the free software world is seriously challenging the old logic and dogmas of the cathedral. People are now exploring how to use this peer economy in non-software and non-computer contexts. We can look forward to a 21st century of liberty, free speech, education, information, environment, wealth, capitalism, community, culture, sharing, innovation. We will have a future no longer dominated by the dominance hierarchies of the past.We have computer technology, a tool so dramatic and empowering in its nature. Anyone with access to the internet has knowledge and information. Knowledge and information is power. Commercial power. Political power. Power to change things. And this power can be wielded against us if we become too sated or ponderous.Technology can used to destroy human freedom. Equally it can enlarge it. It can destroy or create. Make war, or peace. This revolution could lead to terrible consequences or the greatest advances humanity has ever known. Todays computers are clunky drones, but they are rapidly becoming immensely powerful and immensely versatile systems.We are building a new world. And that scares some. We fear the dark and the unknown troubles us. Anything can happen. Ironically, its our fate to venture into the dark. Our glory is not from the mindless humdrum of our automated lives, but when we allow our minds to soar above our physical constraints. All throughout history there were those who had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the future, but would have rather stayed at home.This epoch will enhance the value of human talent, and devalue unskilled human labour writ democracy.http://bitcoinmedia.com/the-cacophony-of-technology/ But the benefit of livestreaming is that we can all watch it together when it's showing http://tv.blinkx.com/show/the-good-wife/vEJlaMTfy_36eiwdThere are some screwed up morals and ethics in this show. It's a show glamorising corporate robots. In S03E12, they got a husband to sleep with a stripper to win a divorce settlement and take custody of his daughter. To limit anyone finding out, they scrub their documents of this info.Great. That is seriously unethical and immoral. I hope we don't see the same thing with bitcoin where following the law like a corporate robot but behaving unethically is seen as good. I hope it becomes about flouting the law for greater good.From my limited viewing of the show, it's all "blaa blaa protect the firm, protect our profits".

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/748 Status: Withdrawn Sorry to hear this shakaru. That's sad. There was some good advice in this thread. This is not like a bucket with holes, but a bucket without a bottom half. This is the stupidest DRM scheme I've ever heard... Firstly, I am not educated on the matter to take a hard stance.However if that is the case, why didn't they simply state that on their website instead of doing into some excuse about not endorsing bitcoin.Basically Julz is saying they're lacking balls in this instance. Can't argue with that. Logs of meeting are on the wiki:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MeetingsNext meeting: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki//3_Jan_2012 What's the pay? I will write about bitcoin and technology if I get to retain copyright on my work or can license it under CC share alike so anyone can copy it elsewhere.My writing: http://bitcoinmedia.com/ Calm down. All the developers in the world won't help you. This is a complex problem.Unless more happened in the last 8 hours, we were discussing before dropping OP_EVAL as an explicit instruction.This simply means that there is a new template transaction type which bitcoin detects and handles gracefully. The top item in the input script is EVALuated without there actually being an OP_EVAL there to tell it to do that.There is an online meeting today:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=56376.0People are free to join, but I guess it is more for developers to discuss the issue than explain it to the community :p Cmon, anyone with half a brain who has looked into this properly, knows that the language is completely different to that used in his other publications and is obviously not him. Ron Paul is not a rascist. There is another discussion: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1958.1760Not wasting more time on this. This meeting is to discuss the new OP_EVAL changes coming to bitcoin.A good summary of the past discussion so far by justmoon can be found:http://privatepaste.com/4088b049afHopefully this can become a weekly thing. For now this is to discuss and inform about the coming changes to bitcoin.----------Where: Freenode IRC #bitcoin-devWhen:  Tuesday 21:00 UTC (16:00 New York time) until 22:00*What:   OP_EVALBitcoin is starting decentralising as any healthy free thinking communityshould. Projects are thiving and the economy is growing. New ideas arebeing realised and will edge out old models disruptively.My hope is that we don't all become fractured. By having weekly regularmeetings, projects can harmonise in lock step. Concepts and algorithms canbe proposed and debated. You'd be surprised what having a scheduled regularplatform can achieve. A soap-box on an island in central waters.For me, I don't have time to wade through IRC discussions, forum posts andmailing lists. At least if the important things are discussed in one placeit makes bitcoin development and the system more accessible.Before meeting:- A wiki page is created for in advance of a weekly meeting.- Announced on forums/mailing lists.- Throughout the week talking points are added to the meeting page.After:- Log of discussion is posted online.- I will type an accessible summary for the community at large onhttp://bitcoinmedia.com/- Next weekly meeting is scheduled.Amir Taaki*We can go over this hour, but this is to stop meetings dwindling off topicinto banal banter and stay focused. That talk was maybe the worst of the entire conference and he had no idea what he was talking about.http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=8oeMsfm5D5s#t=533sThe issue is not price, but freedom.I elaborate more on this here.His talk had nothing to do with bitcoin and was totally valueless.
1) The postgresql_blockchain in libbitcoin (which subvertx uses) plugin's underlying library cppdb can use MySQL/postgres/sqlite/... MySQL doesn't exist simply because I wasn't using it. So it might be possible to remove the postgres only stuff to make it work with mysql but I haven't looked into it.2) Nobody has compiled for windows yet, but there is no linux specific stuff (and there shouldn't be). The code is even made to work on big endian systems too. Getting a windows port would be good  Feel free to hit me up on IRC. I love it too.

I looked on there and saw someone added bitcoinconsultancy.com, intersango.com, bitcoinmedia.com, libbitcoin.org, bitgroups.org. FYI, we're the same group  Usually we say Bitcoin Consultancy is the umbrella (although it's more accurate to call it the R&D arm).So probably you want to make that as one entry.Also maybe consolidate Startup and Company? Bitcoin is still young, and every company listed is also a startup.I added buttcoin on there. They are cool. blaa blaaI travelled to England, Netherlands, Poland, Czech republic, Brazil during last few months without paying money changers and using local bitcoiners to aquire currency.ok I re-read your post. What would happen is that the price of bitcoin would go down vs the more desirable currency. If it happens enough then arbitrage becomes an attractive option.A bitcoin shop would not use Western Union to do their arbitrage. ok watchwood, seems like you beat theymos. looks like matt would have won but his change got reverted.

I tell you what though, short of writing my own berkeley db wrapper there is no decent way to abstract this libary. Their 'C++ API' is essentially the same as their C one except you don't call DB->put(mydb, ...) but instead do mydb->put(...). Nice. Not sure why they bothered. You're advocating the ancient waterfall method which is basically out of fashion since the last decade. The bitcoin codebase is terrible architecturally.You may be interested to review my codebase which is an asynchronous bitcoin toolkit library using proactors. Completion handlers using std::bind and std::function are passed to operations.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30646.0Also a video on the design principles behind the API:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyKcSpx5xDg The question here is not GPL or no GPL, the question is either:AGPL or lesser AGPL.I've been working with the Aaron Williamson of the SFLC and Richard Stallman of the FSF to fix a bug in the AGPL for bitcoin.Then I will weigh up the various arguments for adding or not adding a lesser clause. It is whichever will promote development of the library the most. *GPL licenses mean you can either contribute sourcecode or $$$ to benefit the library (by buying proprietary licenses).Right now as it stands, this library still needs to be completed so these arguments are a time waster The bug I'm referring to is that the AGPL requires not only that you give the sourcecode on demand, but that you're proactive in providing the sourcecode visibly. This is problematic because if you make a small modification while developing or building on a compilation based system (like gentoo) then the act of connecting to the p2p network means you have to provide source. There is no means to do this in the bitcoin sourcecode and the idea itself is problematic; every build must store the sourcecode in a bundle which is served using custom bitcoin protocol extensions.From my understanding, modifying the AGPL for them is complicated and so far the last proposal was:This means that you are able to provide the source code through some other means (such as sending it via email if requested) and it solves the issue.------In an ideal world, copyrights, patents, trademarks and censorship wouldn't exist. Proprietary software would not be able to support itself against rampant piracy. And I would put my sourcecode out in the open for anyone to use as they like.However, we don't live in that ideal world. And I will use what little power I have in the form of the GPL to fight this asymmetric warfare. The balance is totally tilted away from our favour, so why wouldn't you use the only protection afforded to you as a developer.Licenses like the GPL hack the law, twisting it to our will. It is the best example of subversion.When people talk about GPL or MIT licenses being free, they're talking about different kinds of freedom as they're essentially rivalrous freedoms. Being free does not always mean no rules necessarily:And this coming from a person with anarchist tendencies. http://bitcoinmedia.com/eurobit-david-birch-next-generation-money/I personally liked David Birch's talk and feel it added a lot- if not for understanding what the conventional wisdom is. He made us challenge and confront our beliefs, and doing so can only make you more confident of success if you are right.An interesting talk. The thing is not to get too caught up writing long proposals and documents. Think a little bit, code up an implementation, get rolling and refine your requirements as they become obvious. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission. While you know my suggestions:Electrite (my favourite)andElectrolyte Yes. It isn't a requirement to be compliant with the protocol, but it is a little extra added security which is nice. No :p There are checkpoints in bitcoin as an added security measure. If they didn't exist then there would be no limits to reverse the chain. However it isn't a concern. The longest re-organisation ever was 6 blocks deep. Can someone ask dayfall to define first? Wouldn't work without modifying the protocol and sourcecode. Yes, theoretically.No, practically, because of the checkpoints in the block validation code. Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee camping out here No offense, but if you're asking what is needed in a new exchange then you probably shouldn't be in this already saturated market. It should be blindingly obvious. Max of 80 characters. 4 space indents.Variables, functions, class-names, enums, typedefs are lowercase. Macros are uppercase. Private class member variables are suffixed with an _Each line should be indented by either 1 or 2 levels on the next line, and 1 line for each successive indent.If you're going more than 3 levels deep with each new line of code, then generally you are doing something wrong and code should be siphoned off into functions. Always prefer: flat over nested, dumb over clever, slow+clear over fast+obtuse.Functions should never be defined in headers.

Thepool does not order the blocks. To trace a chain of blocks from an endpointyou have to keep looking up the previous block as you go backwards.Assuming we have a valid genesis block, then this pool would produce2 chains like this:We loop through every block in the orphan's pool, setting each block toprocessed each loop. This stops us re-processing a block when a new block isadded again to the pool, re-triggering the organize algorithm.The blockchain is only ever stored as one main chain. In the blockchaindatabase is only stored the currently accepted history. Blocks added to theblockchain are taken out of the orphan's pool, and returned back to the poolwhen removed from the blockchain.If we have the chain:Code:0 -> 1 -> 2a -> 3aThen the remaining blocks in the orphan pool are 2b, 3b, 4b. Block 4b comesinto the pool and will trigger a re-organize. When we run the organizealgorithm, we find out that the chain 2b, 3b, 4b has greater difficulty.Trace backwards through the pool until we cannot cycle backwards anymore. We call this the orphan-root.Organize will first find the fork point within the blockchain to be at block 1 using the orphan-root's previous block hash.The difficulty in the remaining blocks of the main chain and the chain in the orphan pool are calculated. If the main chain algorithm's difficulty is bigger than the orphan's, then the algorithm stops and the main chain is untouched.The new blocks in the orphan pool will replace the ones in the main chain. The end blocks from the main chain are popped off and returned back to the orphan pool. The blocks from the orphan pool are added to the main chain as the new chain.Reorganization has finished.Code:0 -> 1 -> 2b -> 3b -> 4b We'll see about the license afterwards. It's always easier to switch to weaker copyleft than vice versa. For now I want to build.Post about new organize algorithm below. Should I do this?I changed my name on IRC briefly to AmirTaaki and it just felt awkward and strange. I've been using genjix over 10 years now, and the name is a part of my identity. It has a rich history which I don't quite want to give up now. Like a warm blanket wrapped around me.I don't mind my real name either. It's interesting and different. But genjix also means a lot to me as a faceless identity I grew as a person with. I kind of like to be anonymous sometimes. I will occasionally change my name on IRC and pretend not to be me or obfuscate my identity to new people. I spend a lot of time on 4chan. It has a nice concept where it is more important what you say, rather than what you do.If there is a reason for me to switch though, then I will. It isn't a huge deal.
I agree with this totally. I will be supporting whatever spec ThomasV/slush come up with using libbitcoin. Electrum is the way forwards.I would like though (as we discussed on IRC) if you could give the protocol a different name to distinguish it from the client. This mix-up has been very confusing and unfortunate in bitcoin. I have got the lube. Where do I sign up. i was going to write a retort to this article, but the whole thing was so ludicrous i couldn't think how to respondhttp://www.kernelmag.com/yiannopoulos/2011/12/the-online-currency-wars-are-coming/"Since Bitcoin has no central repository its more like digital cash, used to exchange value anonymously. Critics ask how long that anonymity will last."what the hell does that mean."Think of the entire internet as an app, circumscribed by a persistent Facebook login and punctuated with Pay icons"No.. that's just stupid."Bitcoin and Ven havent even scratched the surface of whats possible with online payments. With a ready user base of 800 million users, Facebook may be about to change the way online financial transactions are thought about and conducted. "yeah right. bitcoin underlying protocol can do shit we havent even dreamed or ever thought possible. sky is the limit! happy easter zomg i cant stop laughing  cracking me uphttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBfeLdjNVKY The old client code sucked. The new code is great. This is a good switch that will pay off in the long run by making it more sustainable to develop satoshi bitcoin. Thanks for the info. Yes, they provided me with the exemption. The bug I'm referring to isn't to do with OpenSSL though. It's that the AGPL requires not only that you give the sourcecode on demand, but that you're proactive in providing the sourcecode visibly. This is problematic because if you make a small modification while developing or building on a compilation based system (like gentoo) then the act of connecting to the p2p network means you have to provide source. There is no means to do this in the bitcoin sourcecode and the idea itself is problematic; every build must store the sourcecode in a bundle which is served using custom bitcoin protocol extensions.From my understanding, modifying the AGPL for them is complicated and so far the last proposal was:This means that you are able to provide the source code through some other means (such as sending it via email if requested) and it solves the issue.------In an ideal world, copyrights, patents, trademarks and censorship wouldn't exist. Proprietary software would not be able to support itself against rampant piracy. And I would put my sourcecode out in the open for anyone to use as they like.However, we don't live in that ideal world. And I will use what little power I have in the form of the GPL to fight this asymmetric warfare. The balance is totally tilted away from our favour, so why wouldn't you use the only protection afforded to you as a developer.Licenses like the GPL hack the law, twisting it to our will. It is the best example of subversion. Thanks fellowtraveller  Actually there are a bunch of licensing issues that have to be resolved. Me and the SFLC/FSF are trying to fix up the AGPL since there is a bug in it where bitcoin is concerned. Also OpenSSL conflicts with the GPL and LAGPL was discussed since they get a lot of requests for it.But still got a lot of time since the project is far from maturity. Hey,This project is pretty old. I'm now supporting Electrum,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=52003.0They have the right idea. Spesmilo will be revamped in the future to support Electrum and Electrum will be revamped to support libbitcoin:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30646.0We're all integrating our projects together. Looking forward to this. yawn, another economist who doesn't fully understand bitcoin.If you're interested to speak to real economist who does understand bitcoin and holds some reservations against it, and favours it in other ways, then contact John Barrdear of the LSE.This guy made several glaring mistakes during his article such as saying the bitcoin value reached $0.01 and that it is untraceable. Both demonstrate he only has a superficial understanding of bitcoin possibly gleaned from reading other publications. Same as before, http://bitcoinmedia.com/ We have moved to a newer better platform which is more suited for Bitcoin Media than the current blog format offered to us before.Apologies to everyone who has to repost their comments- there was some informative interesting discussion. However the new site provides us with a better base in which to expand in the future.Interesting articles are in the pipeline and my aim for this site is to engage in outreach & education beyond the bitcoin community. I want to educate on the intracies of this complex system. Intracies which so far have could only be noticed by living, eating and sleeping bitcoin. Intracies buried deep in obscure IRC conversations, personal observations and long forum posts.By putting this info out there, we are equalising bitcoin and democratising the community. http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Z93ZXZT We did have a mistake once when we first migrated to the new Intersango from Britcoin. We accidentally sent 1 BTC to someone 500 times. This money comes out of our own pockets.Since we only keep a small reserve online at a time (most funds are offline) then it is pretty safe. We have the reserve wallet covered: https://intersango.com/security.php Me, molecular and Mitchell (worldly) weighed up the various options for the location of the next conference. Me arguing for London, and molecular for Berlin. Eventually we agreed that London is probably best. However not everyone is convinced. Hopefully we can get some community involvement in the decision making here.- 7 out of 11 of potential notable speakers I have lined up live in London. They are far more likely to attend a London conference but would not take a plane ride because it isn't worth their time. I don't want to give their names away to keep it a pleasant surprise  From running the UK exchange Intersango, we've had a lot of contact with high up financial types in particular.- My press contacts are largely in London: BBC, Guardian, Independent, Channel4 news, Wired, Wall Street Journal.- London is better connected internationally than Berlin.- We held an after conference survey. 10 voted for London, 6 for Berlin, 5 for Prague. 4 others abstained. 70% of the respondents actually attended this conference.- I am in London.- 2 months ago I held the London Bitcoin Meetup at the London Hack Space. The space was small so we limited the event to 30 people, and denied 10 people on the waiting list. 40 people turned up anyway.- London is expensive (50 EUR per night for hotel). However from speaking with a couple hotels so far, they were willing to negotiate a group deal. I also have friends in London and the London Hack Space who could donate sleeping bag space.- Many of our previous speakers came from London: Amir Taaki (me), David Birch, Simon Dixon, Jason Chia, Max Keiser. We also had a nice turnout from UK participants although I agree that the attendance in Prague was much higher among Germans.Together I think these points make a compelling case for London.yossarian is going to respond below so please read his message too.  I really have no comment here. I think this TV episode will be great. Not everything illegal is portrayed as bad on TV. And the main character from reading the descriptions, sounds like the good guy while the FBI agent is the bad guy. The bitcoin price has gone mental as a consequence. 814 views for this story: http://bitcoinmedia.com/bitcoin-tv-episode-confirmedPeople are getting excited over that.http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/mtgoxUSD_depth.htmlBuy side was HUGE earlier.It went from 3.6 to 3.8 in 20 mins. Now it is at 4.10.Deja vu?This is total speculation and has nothing to do with the development of bitcoin. I would BUY BUY BUY then right before the day of the episode SELL SELL SELL http://bitcoinmedia.com/bitcoin-tv-episode-confirmedHoly shit, this is going to drive bitcoin forwards.I dislike the dumb stereotyping though of us technologists :/ Would be nice if they could tell a good story with a nice structure rather than falling back on retarded stereotypes. A good story with interesting characters.Who is more cool: some skinny geek nerd you always see in the movies or Julian FUCKING Assange who was an old school hacker and lover of unix.
Bitcoin is a nerdy geek project. And most of the people using bitcoin don't have much use for too many physical goods- my entire belongings fit into one backpack. And many geeky people from experience are poor. slush is going to working on a new qt client? And you're working on a gtk client in Python and I was working on a qt client in Python ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Spesmilo ).I'm going to make a client eventually for libbitcoin and was planning to adapt bitcoin-qt. We have a ton of overlap between us.When we're both around on irc and slush too might be cool to let each other know what we're all up to. Form a group or something. Try this:I'm not on the forums too often.Feel free to poke me on Freenode. I'm either in #bitcoinconsultancy or I'm lurking. Or you can use my email: genjix@riseup.netThen for fun, you can run the test cases as:... and so on (look under tests/) My response to you was too big so I ended up writing something,http://bitcoinmedia.com/86910565 ok storage is now called blockchain.Also, on http://libbitcoin.org/ is a video about the design philosophy behind libbitcoin. I make one mistake in the video:Code:f2(); f1(); f3();Will be called in the order 2, 1, 3, but not be allowed to run at the same time. Not sure why I tripped up there on that- guess it was being on the spot kind of thing @slush, try autoreconf -i Oops. Thank you- I updated the survey.10 results so far.

Thanks. http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Z93ZXZTThanks Calm down. We spent months organising the conference and made negative money from it. If the videos are slow then it's because we are editing them in our free time. Tell me you're joking. Dubai is a hellish shit-hole. They foreign workers are abused and treated like slaves.My father used to deal with property in Dubai and no way are they happy. They are forced into the crappiest situation. Many are starved, beaten or extorted. They have no due course with the law either.Maybe the few forward facing workers packing bags at the mall are fine, but not the backend slaves. That's why Dubai has had numerous riots from the workers (who are jailed and then deported without anything).The country is horrid for human rights. I hate the place and never want to go back. It's a gigantic artificial motorway complex with nowhere to walk and no natural beauty. Biggest hotel, biggest skyscraper, biggest shopping centre, biggest indoor ski slope, biggest artificial archipelago, biggest fake islands, and most retarded city built by uncivilised backwards sheep herders with more money than sense.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Dubai#Foreign_Workers_.26_Labor_Rights We also made this at brmlab Prague hackerspace,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTBXKWV7v_MIt's an informal video of me explaining bitcoin to someone. What happened to this guy? Would be nice to hear some updates. Hope all is well. acting = functions that transform or perform operations on the data (public member functions of the interface) What is a good name for the blockchain + acting functions? Currently it's called 'storage'ledgerblockchainbackend...There are other components for 'wallet' and 'node_list'. This only concerns blocks, block locators and transactions in the block chain.I'm leaning towards backend. http://buttcoin.org/has-bruce-wagner-pulled-off-the-financial-biggest-scam-on-the-bitcoin-community Sorry but in the chaos, I forgot to make the announcement. It was that we found a bug in the AGPL due to a specific behaviour of bitcoin, and that the SFLC/FSF will be drafting a new version of the AGPL which will include a p2p clause. It's based on the fact that derivative works need to be proactive in providing the source code (you can't provide it on request). Also there was the talk of making a lesser AGPL too.Something small + nice that's happening for bitcoin. But in the confusion I forgot to say it.
I knew one girl in my life who was a stripper. I also knew one girl in my life who had herpes. They were one and the same. Hackerspace party is sick. The hackerspace is holding a party and everyone came here. All night long  People keep asking me about conference videos:/topic in #bitconconsultancy"Conference videos: we've decided on high quality after conference videos vs low quality difficult-to-setup webcasts. Videos should be out during next few weeks." Drama. OK, I'm a scammer too since I was involved in the conference also. Add me to your hit list.kthxbai If you'll be lurking around after the conference with me and slush then I wouldn't stress it. A conference is meant to be fun. It should be good. The hackerspace people are affable. slush i'm at the hackerspace staying at prusnak's house. cya tomorrowBTW i will be selling bitcoins since i need CZK. dont like to pay the scammy money changers.i'll be in prague for a week hanging around the hackerspace. we're planning on doing a bunch of after conference events and workshops here. Patrick Strateman = phantomcircuit. He's the CTO for Intersango and a member of Bitcoin Consultancy Iran's government is totally insane and universally hated within Iran. Nobody likes them.However there are many conflicting forces within this corrupted government- it isn't a monolithic dictatorship. There is even limited dissent which has been continually pushing successfully over the last decades inch by inch to reform the country.Going to war with Iran would be extremely bad. It would rally people around a hated, deeply unpopular and resented regime. I'm also skeptical about sanctions which is simply isolating and hurting Iranian people; the government is religious and doesn't give a shit about running the country to the ground in pursuit of their dogma.For those interested in what day to day life in Iran is like, check my pictures:http://www.flickr.com/photos/genjix/page10/http://www.flickr.com/photos/genjix/page9/http://www.flickr.com/photos/genjix/page8/They are just normal people like you or me in the west. Before the religious people seized control during the power vacuum of the revolution (which was for democratic reform), Iran was a westernised secular country.According to that map, Iran is less religious than Turkey or Poland. I'd harbour that the results are skewed from the repression even and that the results are much more favourable in private. jim, I love you. That was a snappy heart-warmer that made me feel good about free software  Yes. That's cool  But beware that they're a total experimental hack since I don't know what I'm doing when it comes to bindings.If you need to ask me questions, I'm on Freenode IRC in #bitcoinconsultancy as genjix I've made experimental alpha bindings for libbitcoin.

They're a fucking scam and totally not needed. We already have measures in place to stop flooding such as prioritisation of txs. This whole fee business is the mainline client trying to set network policy instead of the miners who run the hardware. You need to send it straight to a miner who is accepting no fee transactions. Your transaction didn't get propagated by the nodes who experienced it. Doesn't mean it can't get into the blockchain.

In shell we trust.- Download blockchain into an SQL database.- Query SQL database to find the balance of a bitcoin address.- Create new private keys.- Sign and verify data using those private keys.- Get bitcoin address from private key.- Create and save a transaction to a file, pipe, network share, USB stick, whatever.- Load and send a transaction to a bitcoin node.Link to subvertx You don't copy paste though. You write to a file then read it in.i.emktx send < /tmp/serialised-txAnd that file can just as easily be a named pipe (which are faster and not really files).Or you can run it through a base64 decoder:echo ... | openssl base64 -d | mktx send OK!But why do you need hex? Just use "openssl base64 ..." to base64 decode your stream and pipe it on.Also I don't think you can use echo ..., you'd need to use cat to read until EOF. You can create a named pipe then open the mktx send with that pipe in bash.Good intro to named pipes: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2156
Made updates to subvertx (updated OP but posting below also). Packages have also been refreshed so you may wish to update.I split the process between creating a transaction and actually broadcasting it into 2 parts rather one command (for etotheipi mainly ). This artifice allows us all the whizz-bang toys like offline transactions, piping a transaction to multiple sends, a flyweight client, piping transactions over network shares to a single bitcoind and whatever guile schemes you can imagine.

Here are some examples.1. We want to send from transaction c524c555aad1932c24c26ec20439a9caefc49f7c0df6d6bccced890ef980b45c's 0th output (which was sent to an address we own) to 2 addresses: 0.02 BTC to 12oabCifvHuxzXtYVGhkxVfWZDvKcU743s and 0.58 BTC to 14DDgj2r8WQEwfTDEjJFBn3wRnHmXzgB3zThere is 1 previous output:00535291532821f2e4879cf670f61396be32b9579400ae1119497f36f268eb40:1There are 2 recipients:12oabCifvHuxzXtYVGhkxVfWZDvKcU743s:200000014DDgj2r8WQEwfTDEjJFBn3wRnHmXzgB3z:58000000Note that we use internal BTC amounts (decimal value * 10^8 - see help text).Now to spend that output, it has to have been sent to an address you own, hopefully generated using the priv tool earlier Code:$ mktx create -p priv@c524c555aad1932c24c26ec20439a9caefc49f7c0df6d6bccced890ef980b45c:0 -k priv@keys/privkey -r 12oabCifvHuxzXtYVGhkxVfWZDvKcU743s:2000000 -r 14DDgj2r8WQEwfTDEjJFBn3wRnHmXzgB3z:58000000... funny binary output here ...If we wish to store that output we can use a redirection > to save it.

Anyway I'm not sure that the PMF guy there is Max Keiser since I remember Mitchell telling me when he was breaking down the costs that we have to pay for some flights. You can't fault that this conference is going to earn us negative money and a lot of effort and time has gone into it to benefit the community.Also it still isn't confirmed 'officially' but Wikileaks is sending a spokesman + a prerecorded talk by Julian Assange (who wanted to but couldn't for obvious reasons ) I released a tool to do all this a while back:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50721.0Has Ubuntu, Gentoo and source code packages. Hi,Sorry for the week long delay with withdrawals. We haven't completely got setup with withdrawals yet, but we will manually be doing the larger withdrawals over the next few days; tomorrow will be withdrawals over 1000 GBP. The whole backlog should be completed once we are completely setup with the new bank which we expect to happen by the end of this working week (Friday).Amir Taaki Incidents at mtgox:- No password brute force protection. People weren't recompensated.- SQL injection.- Leak of entire database.- Using floats internally for orders.- CSRF exploit. People weren't recompensated.- Trying to partially blame us for discovering it after we spent all of 3 days trying to contact him (even rung a friend of his in France) before privately disclosing it to a trusted forum member to confirm.- Intrusion and stealing of funds.- Losing funds through using alpha bitcoin software.- Not responding to reporters questions leaving the media to speculate.... And more!Mtgox is still the biggest exchange, and they kept their site up through these incidents when it should've been taken down until the problems were fixed.when bitcoin.pl lost all their funds, they were up the next day and trading at 3/4 their previous volume.Point is that people don't do shit. They will always keep using untrustworthy shoddy services. This posturing is all very well and nice, but a monopoly will keep dominating a market through either holding a first-entrant advantage (like bitcoin vs other future cryptocurrencies) or anti-competitve practices. Julian Assange (a guy that has read through thousands of leaked documents) agrees with me: Take a look at about every single transaction on blockexplorer. Most of them have fees.And to avoid the tx-purgatory, we have the sequence numbers. I don't use a fee and my transactions send/confirm fine.http://blockexplorer.com/tx/f5cffc95a4a83c23cb9f666c7cf552f27d9845778bb09a98d5169c461483ba41#i3150376 Updated the OP with the ebuild made by Kamil Domański.Code:layman -a bitcoinemerge subvertx Gentoo ebuildKamil Domański has made a gentoo ebuild.Code:layman -a bitcoinemerge libbitcoin OK, I posted a pledge thread here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=51070.0I PMed the Casascius guy to let him know. OK, we will pool our monies and bulk buy some coins for the conference. Maybe have a poker home game with them or something  Buying in bulk is cheaper. Then afterwards the coins are split proportionally and you're free to do whatever you want such as resell them.Post your pledges below and I'll update this OP. I'll get the Casascius guy to respond here. We'll bulk buy the coins and have them sent directly to the conference venue to collect.Not sure how much I'm going to pledge yet, so for now say that I'm 0 BTC.1LKaLcEjmyaKRvCnoyxoBBm5yQkmQ799tg the casascius guy agreed to sell me a bunch of cheap coins if I buy in bulk. if you all message me, then we can maybe do something like we all pool our monies and everybody gets a share of X coins to do whatever they want with (resell them at the conference for profit .etc).If there's sufficient interest then I'll make a new thread and get the casascius guy to post. Then we'll have the coins shipped directly to the conference venue. Seems fine. He's stated what is what and isn't trying to mislead anyone. It's your own prerogative whether you want it or not. @grondilu, I changed it according to your suggestions.I think you want this:https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/subvertx/blobs/master/src/mktx.cppHowever it doesn't do node discovery yet, so you have to know who you're connecting to beforehand.You will need to modify mktx to be a new program that reads in a byte stream for the raw transaction.See this:https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/blobs/master/tests/dialect-test.cppIf there is a problem reading the stream then it will throw an exception called end_of_stream. That exception is thrown by the internal deserialising object inside that dialect object:https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/blobs/master/include/bitcoin/util/serializer.hppOf course.

Intersango offers bank deposits in USD and a number of other currencies: Update 04 November 2011:We now have gained access to our HSBC records from last week. Missing deposits will be credited this weekend. A change in the format of the records means there is a slight delay in us important the statements. Accounts should be credited on Sunday. Withdrawals are still delayed, but the backlog should start and finish next week. Apologies for any delay.Yeah, Lloyds is partly owned by the public sector. The nice thing about that is that as a consequence they have a sane Terms & Conditions that doesn't entitle them to do whatever they want. Also Lloyds is a very play-it-safe bank and doesn't unnecessarily over-expose themselves to high risk assets like some other crazy banks.The downside is the inefficiency that comes from being partially of the public sector. How can I contact the Silk Road guys? I have a case I want to put before them about putting out some rough figures to help bitcoin. I have some questions to ask them. Thanks, finway. This is great news. I've never been on there but you've confirmed my suspicion that it's a small part of the bitcoin economy.Where did you get those numbers from? Are they on the site? I actually bought several $k around $0.2 or so, sold them and was like "fuck yeah! $100". Waited and waited after they sharply rose to $1 because I was *sure* a crash was coming due to the reasons in the OP.Looks like my time will come again this time around! haha Should've kept those bitcoins afterall  Unenforceable.Miners would all need the same fee structure.

Meaningless/sampling bias/small sample size. Yes they do. As stated here, it is a temporary company as Intersango LTD is owned by multiple share-holders who have to be present to open the account or be available to a notary abroad. That takes time, but we fully intend to switch the account from Interteni LTD to Intersango LTD in the future. Right now, there are more pressing matters.Interteni LTD (company number: 07826131) under the Companies Act 2006.Intersango LTD (company number: 07683978) under the Companies Act 2006.The certificate of incorporation for Intersango is available on our about us page, and the one for Interteni should be available later today. For now you can download it from here.We are required before opening the bank account to divulge all information and I was completely open about our activities. The manager was told about http://intersango.com and the full details of Bitcoin Consultancy's operations (which I drew her some diagrams of our company structure to explain to her colleagues). Considering that the Lloyds bank manager was extremely displeased at our prior treatment and took several photocopies of our past statements and letters, they know we are the same people behind Intersango LTD. Our website is on their records, and for us to lie or falsify information is highly illegal and would put me at risk of jailtime. There were some decent people who helped me/us out in our early days when it was just me alone. We have a list of their names to reward them one day if we become successful  Us accidentally sending you bitcoins when we first newly setup the site, does not consitute a 'hacking' but is a human error, and then theft when you refused to pay the money back.It was a change-over error which was controllable. The compensated loss was controllable due to the measures in place such as offline wallet for the actual site balance. I propose 3 step phase plan:step 1. Protocol specifics are definitively agreed upon. No going back after this step. Takes as long as it has too, but ideally 1 month.step 2. Implementations are all synchronised and ready with branch/patches ready to accept the new changes. Testing needs to be done. 1 month.step 3. A date is set for the switch-over. Packages are released and all merchants/users/vendors/miners are given a switch-over date before the change becomes live. Enough time needs to be give for everybody to change over. I propose 2 months.After this and with enough testing, the OP_EVAL can be introduced into the GUI and such after a while. This puts the total timeframe at around under 6 months. btw in libbitcoin there are a bunch of other tools but I didn't include them as they're more complicated to setup:examples/pollerdownload the bitcoin blockchain into a postgresql databaseexamples/subvertx/balancefind the balance of a bitcoin address using the downloaded database after running the poller abovetests/netconnect, handshake (swap versions, wait for veracks) and then download the first 500 blocks.

The 'create' actually constructs the transaction and then dumps its binary network format to STDOUT. 'send' reads from STDIN and sends it to the network. By default it sends to localhost:8333, but you can change it using the --host and --port options.A transaction consists of inputs. You can use blockexplorer to look them up. Here are some examples.1.

She has had ataxic cerebral palsy from birth that led her to a passion for technology, which was strictly forbidden by her father's backwards views. The judge's wife was emotionally abused herself and was severely manipulated into assisting the beating and should not be blamed for any content in this video. The judge's wife has since left the marriage due to the abuse, which continues to this day, and has sincerely apologized and repented for her part and for allowing such a thing, long before this video was even revealed to exist.

I can confirm that the new bank is working.Iceburg will indeed be available through the website.I wanted to give people a progress update, since it has been a week since we last said anything, but the rest of my group wanted to check that the bank works first before we put the details up. Changes should be out later today unless Q&A finds any significant problems.If there is a real urgency to get funds on, you can message support for the bank details. Well I live in London and was looking for real life services there. I did not see your salon on the map ever:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Real_world_shopsYou should put your details, cost, address up there. There are a few bitcoin people in London. Services to actually make bitcoin useful beyond speculation. Developers to battle harden and secure the software underlying the network.Everything else is secondary. With services that people want, fully licensed large scale exchanges would move into bitcoin. The legal precedent thing is a good idea though. Update on bank situation: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50587.0 Update 04 November 2011:We now have gained access to our HSBC records from last week. Missing deposits will be credited this weekend. A change in the format of the records means there is a slight delay in us important the statements. Accounts should be credited on Sunday. Withdrawals are still delayed, but the backlog should start and finish next week. Apologies for any delay.HSBC problemsOne week ago our HSBC account was shut down suddenly without warning overnight. According to HSBC's own Terms & Conditions: "7.1 If we wish to close your account, we will give you at least 2 months prior notice in writing unless there are circumstances in which we can justify ending our relationship earlier."It is very rare for a bank account to be terminated out of the blue. The normal procedure is to give at least 30 days notification before terminating accounts. Many of the banks in the UK (Lloyds, Barclays, Natwest) state this in their T&C. Our lawyer is looking into this as HSBC has damaged our reputation and trust which we work hard to maintain. As a side effect, deposits from last week made into our HSBC account will be delayed until we are able to obtain the records (which HSBC has not handed us yet).Lloyds TSB new accountEarlier this year, we were banking with Lloyds TSB before being asked to take our business elsewhere. We have been in contact with Lloyds TSB who have assigned us a personal account manager who is also the manager of the bank branch. It turned out the previous account manager was ill equipped to handle the scale of our volume and is a person in a call centre in Birmingham, and sees 300+ accounts a day. This time around we've been assigned a manager who handles 30 accounts a month due to the complicated nature of our operations and the scale of our turnover.Lloyds TSB were very keen to have our operations back, and a formal complaint has been launched by the bank staff at the way we were dealt with. We were told that our treatment was totally unacceptable as we're a high value customer.We are accepting deposits again with Lloyds TSB (details can be found on the GBP accounts page). Deposits may be a little slower than usual (possibly up to a week) as registration for their online service is underway. Once that's done, we'll be processing deposits immediately. Withdrawals may take longer as we are in the midst of transitioning out of HSBC into Lloyds. We are also in talks with a few other banks who have shown a sudden interest in our business.Iceberg and GTC/FOK/IOC ordersWe have added iceberg orders to the site. Iceberg orders allow someone to place an order without indicating the true volume of that order. Placing an order of 100 BTC with an iceberg value of 10 BTC, means only 10 BTC will ever show of that 100 BTC at a time. As the order is fulfilled, the iceberg amount will remain refilled until the remaining order amount drops under 10 BTC.We have added two new order types (FOK and IOC).Good Til Cancelled is your normal order type. Remains on the orderbook until it has been cancelled.Fill Or Kill will only fill an order if a corresponding order can completely cover it.Instant Or Cancel will place an order the orderbook much like GTC, trying to fullfill it as much as possible. It then immediately expires and the remaining order is cancelled.Site changesVarious changes have been made throughout the site to improve the style and usability. There are more coming in the next few weeks.Our company information has been added to the About us page. Detailed information on our fees can be found on our fees page.Questions or suggestions can be directed to support@intersango.com . We're also available on Freenode IRC #bitcoinconsultancy (look for genjix or phantomcircuit). Business proposals should be sent to our Director, Donald Norman (donald@bitcoinconsultancy.com).We also encourage people to register for the European Bitcoin Conference which is being held in cooperation with us, and for developers to have a look at some of our community projects such as libbitcoin or subvertx.Amir Taaki Because if you transfer cold hard cash as a business in any significant volume you will get arrested for money laundering. Even if you check documents and ID, but end up with bad money, you will go to prison. I strongly recommend against those services unless they are highly regulated and following KYC laws.Not because I support high levels of regulation, but to protect people from going to jail needlessly. There's a Solver in the code that matches transactions to only 2 allowed templates/formats. Without passing this template, transactions cannot make it into the memory pool and don't get propagated.If you wish to make a new tx type you have to lobby for it to be included in the list of templates. Fact is the big content industries are totally corrupt. Anything to punish or hurt them is good. Does anyone here go to shopping.com, internet.com, books.com, news.com ... https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=38246.0https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/blobs/master/bitcoin.sql You've put a lot of effort into making that site, and developing an exchange is not easy  I started out similar to you with Britcoin, but have learnt along the way a lot about the law and how finance works. Trust me, you aren't covered by the law and there's serious potential for trouble if you're not careful.Best of luck. Although I'd advise you that the exchange market is already pretty saturated so you're unlikely to change much. Might be good to help develop some of the other desperately needed/severely under-developed sectors of the bitcoin economy. Especially since you have the skills to put to good use.I can understand your frustration from you having the best of intentions, and feel hard done by the attacks here. But you have to realise that the bitcoin community has had it bad with scammers and inexperienced site operators. Therefore I can sympathise with the comments here.There's so much to learn about running an effective exchange technically (something MtGox still hasn't got right). I began only on my own, but was lucky along the way to pick up a great team of various experts. The skepticism of any new exchange is totally understandable given the past history in the bitcoin world.Also to the others: the exchange is nice. I checked it out and he's implemented some nice security features. A scam site wouldn't go to this effort necessarily by going to this extra effort.The only way new businesses will succeed in the bitcoin economy is if people try them out and give them a chance. Not every new site is a scam. you go to the previous block and find what the next difficulty should be. the bits returned should be the same as the current block's bits.the function is called GetNextWorkRequired and it takes the previous block to the current one as an argument OP_FALSE is referenced nowhere and OP_0 only exists in GetOpName(...)GetOp2 reads the opcode and then if it's less than PUSHDATA4, will branch to the push data stack part, and then on line 538 if (opcode < OP_PUSHDATA1) nSize will be set to 0.EvalScript also interprets it as a push n bytes to the stack in the if ( ... && 0 <= opcode ...) after the previous first block of if (opcode ==  ...).
That's it. Keep fanning the flames of the internet hate machine. Test our boundaries before we inevitably snap. Don't let yourselves be boxed and pushed around like the cattle they want you to be! This is our time, our future when for the first time we have found a way to define ourselves as artisans, industrialists, scientists and visionaries. For when the time has come and greed has taken over, dictators will die and people live. A sick machine that you have to throw yourself under the wheels and get ground up in the gears because unless you are free you are just raw material for a rube goldberg machine, an apparatus of silly superstition and institutions that function without knowing why.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_bERAf5KAg&feature=relatedhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=citzRjwk-sQWhy do they keep trying to pull this shit. Fuck off the internet. You didn't build it, stop trying to legislate it. People that don't know how it works are trying to make the rules for the world's most incredible tool. A liberating, intense network of peoples worldwide with their own world, monetary system, machines and customs.Pirate! Don't buy or pay a single cent. Pirate everything and give everyone stacks of free copies as presents for big occasions. Rip movies, burn CDs, spread the wealth about. Shout about computer freedom. Smoke weed. Be disruptive. Boycott retarded laws. Let them know they aren't welcome. Consign them to irrelevancy by civil disobedience and online sit-ins. i added an explanation to the op. basically OP_0 is defined, but there is no op that pushes a 0 to the stack. Instead it's actually interpreted as push 0 bytes to the stack. See script.h GetOp2 This one change might be 8 lines of code.100 of these future changes to partially protect the scripting language imperfectly.An additional 1k lines of code total.1 month of extra work.An ambiguous restricted bloated standard that nobody understands. Multiple revisions and re-revisions to re-enable disabled behaviour and odd-corner cases nobody imagined where people need to abuse the scripting language in their own weird way.Many buggy implementations.Conclusion: KISS Multibit is looking sexy. Keep up the great work You might want to read these suggestions for improving your client. If someone finds some old coins they'd be economically stupid to suddenly dump them all on the market and make their holdings worthless. And at most it would result in short term volatility, not long term instability. No, it's not a flaw. You can read the chatlog I pasted on page 2 for more information why. Or Intersango, never been hacked, run by bitcoin developers, been running since March 2011 and contributes back to the community. If you truly want to support the bitcoin world, then support us. We create projects through our group (Bitcoin Consultancy) which we use to fund further development on bitcoin and projects around it.We were the ones that discovered the CSRF exploit in MtGox and other exchanges. TBH MtGox has a very poor track record when it comes to security, and they don't seem to have learnt from their lessons. We were the ones who had to respond to the media (by contacting them) when they crashed causing reporters to say bitcoin had been hacked and MtGox ignored all calls for a statement from them.joepie, Diablo and some other people here lost money which MtGox has never paid back as a result of the CSRF exploit. They were also dishonest on multiple occasions, outright lying or covering things up. Even now they are blaming this on the bitcoin network not accepting transactions with inputs more than 255 (if you read the chatlog I pasted on page 2) which is wrong considering that a) there is no limit and b) the max number of inputs in any of their transactions was 4.We're the only long running exchange that hasn't been compromised (formerly Britcoin) and are based in London with a development team. Our group (Bitcoin Consultancy) is also actively involved in developing other areas of bitcoin, operates other services and is working with merchants. And we charge no fees.Our about us: https://intersango.com/about-us.phpSecurity: https://intersango.com/security.phpFees: https://intersango.com/fees.phpOur development's group website: http://bitcoinconsultancy.com/We were the ones just at SWIFT's (the messaging network used for international bank transfers) SIBOS conference on the future of banking discussing how bitcoin could be used to improve international transfers.So we're pretty much heavily invested in bitcoin for the long term. The purpose of our group is to hire people to work full-time on furthering bitcoin. We release many of our project's source code for the community. We're also helping organise the European Bitcoin Conference.If you appreciate our work, and wish for bitcoin to grow, then use our exchange. In return it allows us to grow our development team to push forwards and create more community projects we can contribute. It's my hope to turn this into a talent base to allow the brightest minds to prosper and develop cool technology- like Google or Apple but for specifically for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Thought you all might find this chat from our channel useful: Yeah I realised that once I saw that 0x00 is OP_0 rather than push 0 bytes.EDIT: on closer inspection, actually OP_0 is defined but not ever used. The normal behaviour of the client is to push 0 bytes, so there can't be any destination address. The script looks like: 76a90088acThat's the standard transaction (tx for short) which is:dup (0x76), hash160 (0xa9), 0x14 (push 20 bytes to the stack), .... (next 20 bytes of hash of public key), equalverify (0x88), checksig (0xac)Only in this case the 0x14 has been replaced by 00, which in scripting language means push 0 bytes.It's a tx which has been sent to nothing.

It's a little suspicious that all these events happened within the span of 5 days (one working week):- MTGox EUR and GBP accounts have been closed.- Intersango GBP (our EUR account remains) were suddenly terminated overnight.- TradeHill EUR bank account was closed.- ExchangeBitcoins closes suddenly (might be unrelated).Notice: UK bank account closuresTransfers made to our HSBC account after the 18th which had not yet reached your account will be delayed.

I just found this video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwmjyeKE6Kk&feature=channel_video_titleTotally bossed it.  bit-pay We use it to mean a youngster that was acting like an idiot and got themselves killed. A tutorial I wrote on fixing laptops: Nothing to add except that this could be a big boon.Bitcoin is just another asset, and adding it there could allow big money to flow.Now for a dissenting opinion:I'm not a finance person so I can't really make an informed opinion, but what do you think of the above? Yeah, I never liked the name Casascius anyway. It's too much of a tongue twister.
Such a shame. What a loser. less than 1 minute?Know what a random stranger said to me in the street recently:"Bitcoins? Didn't they get raided recently. Lost all their money." Ahhh true, I forgot about the case insensitivity.Thanks for the advice. ok so I just commited an example app to get the balance of a bitcoin address:Code:#include <iostream>#include <bitcoin/types.hpp>#include <bitcoin/kernel.hpp>#include <bitcoin/storage/postgresql_storage.hpp>#include <bitcoin/util/logger.hpp>using namespace libbitcoin;void display_balance(const std::error_code& ec, uint64_t value){    if (ec)    {        log_fatal() << ec.message();        return;    }    log_info() << "Balance: " << value;}int main(){    kernel_ptr app(new kernel());    storage_ptr app_storage(new postgresql_storage(        app, "bitcoin", "genjix", ""));    app->register_storage(app_storage);    data_chunk address =         bytes_from_pretty("12 ab 8d c5 88 ca 9d 57 87 dd "                          "e7 eb 29 56 9d a6 3c 3a 23 8c");    app_storage->fetch_balance(address, display_balance);    std::cin.get();    return 0;}Does anyone here know how I could do something like:Code:SELECT sum(value) FROM outputs WHERE script LIKE decode('76a91412ab8dc588ca9', 'hex') + '%';Where script is a bytea object in order for me to support firstbits?That way I could add a fetch_balance_partial(...) method to support this. I have a friend (Martin Dittus) who runs the non-profit London Hackspace who expressed an interest in doing this when we were tossing around the idea some months back. Would be worth getting him on board if so to do the adminstration/relevant registration.Also another friend of mine, jaromil, works in the Dutch public sector and runs the non-profit dyne foundation and would definitely be up for helping. a1zp1eAlso my vote goes to having it not fixed at any length. You can for instance say a1zp1e or a1zp1ep5q or a1 (as long as there's no conflicting matches- in which case it fails). Sorry, I didn't see your PM as it isn't very obvious when you have new messages. Answering now. I'm not sure that's a good idea.I never get confused between a fax number and a telephone number. You usually state what an identifier means- it's far easier to remember.Bitcoin: 1kk5kvsBitcoin: kk5kfbThe 1 is redundant and not needed. We don't need a checksum to make sure it's a bitcoin address as that is unlikely to happen.There are some good single character checksums such as the Luhn algorithm. We've been trying this for months and months already. It's been our main goal from day 1. Nope, for security reasons.Although the question is why? Someone in the EU commanded for a bunch of EUR and GBP accounts in 4 different countries to be shut-down in under a week after being open for 6+ months. Synopsis:- MTGox EUR and GBP accounts have been closed.- Intersango GBP (our EUR account remains) were suddenly terminated overnight.- TradeHill EUR bank account was closed.- ExchangeBitcoins closes suddenly (might be unrelated).Solutions:Not having exchanges for bitcoin is a bad thing, and will destroy confidence in the currency if don't believe that you'll be able to exchange your bitcoins for fiat in the future.Other solutions to this crisis are hard to come by. An idea is accepting cash vouchers, however to accept them is no easy task. Working with card payments is infeasible as they're reversible and VISA/MASTERCARD would never stand for supporting competing businesses.WOT systems are nice, but they fail to scale beyond a few dozen users and are ripe to be gamed by scammers. WOT also doesn't have much liquidity as you have to be pro-active in deducing the market-rate to find appropriate orders.Someone in the EU commanded for a bunch of EUR and GBP accounts in 4 different countries to be shut-down in under a week after being open for 6+ months. Oh! That is clever!I must certainly will.Tip: bitcoin addresses always begin with 1, so maybe use Kk5kFb instead. Calm down Adolf. I would love to invite the CIA or FBI to debate bitcoin!That would be incredible. Let the world see our arguments in the open based on individual merit!More openness to alternative viewpoints in the community please. Lets not stop challenging ourselves otherwise we will become dogmatic cultists repeating each others inbred lines. Vili represents a significant proportion of society who thinks along his lines. We can build a bridge to them.You won't win people over by shutting them out or fighting them. Bitcoin is an inclusive thing, and there is no reason why everybody can't be accommodated. There is an enormous potential with Bitcoin for huge positive social good. And a whole lot more than mere anonymity and anti-authoritarianism.By not being willing to also demonstrate the other aspects that make bitcoin so amazing, we are handing a victory to the naysayers who argue that bitcoin is a way for drug traffickers, criminals, terrorists and paedophiles to evade the law. Bitcoin is MUCH MORE than that.It is something that will transform culture on the internet with funding models previously unimagined due to the simplicity, the divisibility and the extensible scripting system. It is a system that will weaken international borders and bring about an egalitarian inter-connected future for economics, how the internet transformed knowledge-transfer for information.

Saluton!En Prago okazos konferencon pri interesa projekto nomita Bitmono.Bitmono estas discentra valuto. La mono ne posedas regantan aŭtoritaton kaj funkcias kiel baza reto. Kio signifas bazan reton? Ĝi signifas samtavola ŝutado, kie ĉiu persono egalas en la reto.Neniu persono povas ordoni al vi, ke li kreu regulojn pri kiel vi uzi vian monon. Ekzemple, retopaĝo ekzistas per Tor por aĉetado de narkotaĵo kiel Mariĥuano.Mi parolos tie pri bitmono, kaj feliĉiĝos kunvenigi aliajn esperantistojn. Mia nomo estas Amir Taaki.La ligo: conference.bitgroups.orgEsperanto, Linukso, Bitmono, Vikipedio, ... kaj tiel plu. Tiuj projektoj nature similas unu la alian. The European Bitcoin Conference is being held in Prague.Prague conference: conference.bitgroups.org Small update:Thanks to phantomcircuit to DB is much faster and more efficient. I've put up database dumps of the blockchain. updated dump above:- more efficient db format- 150256 blocks- faster (uses bytea for hashes, compacted scripts)
This. The banks are continually fucking with us, taking up around 70% of our time and has cost us thousands.The amount of bureaucratic work we put into keeping the exchange running is unbelievable. This court decision is about the worst possible news ever and threatens to end all the exchanges in Europe. We are worried now.I recommend people, to not keep more than they absolutely need on the exchanges. You should be doing that anyway. Unfortunately many people use us as a savings account (against our recommendation). I do not think Diaspora is a wise use of cash.There are far better free software projects to donate to. Diaspora raised more than 200k last year to write a simple web application, it's still not finished... and they need more?Both http://opensource.appleseedproject.org/ and https://n-1.cc/ (elgg) are projects made on much small budgets and teams (appleseed is one guy AFAIK), and they're far better. Your money won't be efficiently used if donated to Diaspora.I would pick some piece of free software you use often or you think Linux needs, and donate to that  TBH the diaspora guys come off clueless when you watch their initial fund-raising video. The software itself is pretty bad and requires all these esoteric dependencies rather than using tried and tested libraries.Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqxQgfQD24M This is all pseudoscience.Talk page:This isn't exactly a real psychological theory. This is just a hypothesis thought up by a computer programmer/blogger. While I think it is interesting, I don't really think it needs it's own Wikipedia page linked as a psychology stub. Maybe once some folks with PhD.'s do some experiments and actually turn it into a theory, then we can write about it here. Otherwise, I am forced to assume that this page was added to Wikipedia by the blogger himself. If this is the case, then this is improper use of Wikipedia. I call your sign and raise you a banner,My friend Jaromil was at Occupy Amsterdam with that  Number 2. looks good "The European Payments Environment" to see what competition bitcoin has and how it fits in the regulatory frameworks. lol, yeah I didn't feel like I was contributing much to the convo so I was going to type a proper response instead but then... ahhh lost interest.Here's the unfinished version:----------C++ is perfectly standard and for good reason. C is simplistic which makes it ideal for small projects.I think critics of C++, cannot code C++. It's not only C with classes, but template meta-programming, RAII, design patterns, generalised expressions and so on, all with type-safety.There's a reason many large projects are written in it, but not in Python. But the language is not easy to learn and  Is this a joke? 1% tax on every transaction would kill liquidity and destroy the economy. <OccupyLSX647> Hi all, is there plans to cripple the stock exchange by organising a mass withdrawal yet? If not I can get a project under way. A complete collapse of the system by just removing our funds would be the ultimate slap in the face!!<genjix> that won't work.<OccupyLSX647> On a global scale it would...<genjix> you can't cripple a stock exchange by withdrawing from a bankNaivete. Their hearts are maybe in the right place at least. It's a good chance to show people bitcoin exists. Not sell them on our propaganda, but build a bridge. I'm going down to Occupy London tomorrow. Feel free to join me.I'll be doing the usual talk, Q&A and fliers for bitcoin. Suggestions welcome below. "The biggest indicator for success in America is not a level of merit or hard work, but the amount of wealth inherited from family members", says Samuel Bowles, an economist at the Sante Fe institute.Debate. >Greedy misanthropist that sold shiny gadgets with sweatshop labor dies and is praised by millions.>Creator of the most widely used programming language of all time and pioneer of Unix, both arguably a significant contributing factor to the success of every modern tech company, dies and not a single newspaper cares.Inventor of C and UNIX. 4chan has a sticky for him. That's the extent of media coverage I could find.A real legend of technology has died and nobody will even understand what he did.exit(0); lonelyminer sent me this PM: We've got a great lineup for the conference (and some more which aren't on there yet), but are still missing speakers against bitcoin!Many pro or neutral bitcoin people we ask are enthusiastic, but we haven't been able to get any anti- people on board. One of them even responded negatively to me, despite me being very polite. Perhaps they are too emotionally invested in hating on bitcoin or seeing us as scammers! (who knows)Anyway, please suggest people we can contact. I'd hate for this to be a bitcoin cult meeting, and would rather have an open discussion from both sides. There's too much group-think and memetic inbreeding in the community.We have all the groups covered, but feel free to suggest other people too. Hey DavinciJ15! Glad to see your last video about writing software. Best of luck. Make sure to stop by the IRC channels #bitcoin and #bitcoin-dev (and our own #bitcoinconsultancy) as that's where the community is at. http://bitcoin.witcoin.com/p/1807 tl;dr  I found this in an Occupy Wall Street discussion:Not too different from the views of some here. Uses different terms though.Another quote:Leftist and rightist is a dividing issue. They are people. Give us the link then instead of making outrageous claims. Strange. It worked last night; first time I was seeing stars then faces and I instantly stopped because it freaked me out. Second time some big ancient tunnels. But now this morning nothing's happening :/Guess you have to be tired and relaxed.Edit: OK, well I got some nice visuals and cool imagery, but nothing as intense as last night...
Informative post. These are my same sentiments. It's easy to be an arm-chair pessimist. But more rewarding to be helping others form an understanding. Not imposing your ideas, but being an available infopoint.And the protesters are not one political colour. They're people from all planets. Just how the bitcoin community is not of one political group. Are there any puredata patches? Blank pages? When I click the arrows I get blank pages.edit: now it works Hello mum. Nice dress you got there >_>haha this is funneh. do the people know we're watching them? Without looking up what Ganzfeld effect is or reading the comments, try this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z7cE-M0ZaIReally intense... Damn. I cannot get past 2 mins before it becomes too overpowering. I think I know what the problem is. Would you mind sending me your account login to support@intersango.com? The front-end of the site is simply display, but internally everything should be fine.Thanks. lol he makes really good points. This is great  We need more clients. Since you're working on the network part feel free to ask me any questions. I pretty much know the source code inside out. I'm genjix on Freenode IRC in #bitcoinconsultancy or Skype: zgenjix (although IRC is better If you're looking for a good library/framework, then Twisted is a really good choice. It's a piece of battle-hardened software and used by several big vendors (like Facebook, Rackspace .etc).Also AGPL is fine. That poster is wrong when he says it cannot be used in commercial settings- it sure can. Think of other AGPL'ed software like SQL databases. You're communicating over the wire with a daemon. Same with bitcoin. The only time you have to release the source code is when you a) extend the program or b) link against the program/make function calls. Everything else is kosher. The Vibanko.com sourcecode is open:https://gitorious.org/vibanko We're the only long running exchange that hasn't been compromised (formerly Britcoin) and are based in London with a development team. Our group (Bitcoin Consultancy) is also actively involved in developing other areas of bitcoin, operates other services and is working with merchants. And we charge no fees.Our about us: https://intersango.com/about-us.phpSecurity: https://intersango.com/security.phpOur development's group website: http://bitcoinconsultancy.com/We were the ones just at SWIFT's (the messaging network used for international bank transfers) SIBOS conference on the future of banking discussing how bitcoin could be used to improve international transfers.So we're pretty much heavily invested in bitcoin for the long term. The purpose of our group is to hire people to work full-time on furthering bitcoin. We release many of our project's source code for the community. We're also helping organise the European Bitcoin Conference.If you appreciate our work, and wish for bitcoin to grow, then use our exchange. In return it allows us to grow our development team to push forwards and create more community projects we can contribute. It's my hope to turn this into a talent base to allow the brightest minds to prosper and develop cool technology- like Google or Apple but for specifically for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Shame about that London RSA talk as it's the day before the Prague bitcoin conference:November 25-27 European Bitcoin Conference: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40272.0 Why were people using an exchange in Eastern Europe with no public contacts and a previous history of bad security? Same story with MtGox. Same story with MyBitcoin. I honestly cannot understand why.And I should mention that orderbook volume is usually 1% of the total funds on a site. It probably is a significant amount of funds. It's sad this has to happen to people time and again. https://vibanko.com/ Wait, this is the same Atlas that was a gigantic misanthrope before? Now he is calling himself an altruist?Your world view is breaking down as you're seeing the gigantic flaws in your belief system.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12rP8ybp13sIt's ok. My world view is in constant flux that I've stopped holding dogmas. You should really look into Carl Sagan or James Burke for some other perspectives that will add value to your belief system. They certainly changed me fundamentally. Well that's nice to know that it was a misunderstanding. These things usually are and it can be hard being a mod. I guess bitcoinmarkets did look commercial at first glance, especially if you're busy. What's your motivation for opening a new exchange considering how saturated the market is? Why not some other service? Just curious.Good luck with your exchange though. Hypocrisy from the same people who are supposed to be fighting for free speech. OP_CHECKMULTISIG makes it possible to have a transaction that requires several signatures (need 2 of 3 sigs from A, B, C). This proposal is to allow finer grained logic for when a payment is redeemed (A and B's sigs or just C). Big milestone reached! libbitcoin is the one of the first alternative implementations of the bitcoin protocol (along with node-bitcoin-p2p) to do full blockchain validation! Exciting milestone. It's taken me around 6 hours to download and validate the blockchain.Here's a sample of validation times at 130k blocks in milliseconds:11222973160384071795375116511163588148149325871071895795665723299825103842911551471401855587153167124728161234920Also I wrote a development statement for libbitcoin (also in the OP).The Zen of libbitcoinReadability over speed.Beauty over convenience.Simplicity over complexity.Architected, not hacked.Flat, not nested.Explicit, not implicit.Errors should be loud.Never is better than right now.Now is better than never.Be flexible and configurable.Build houses from bricks, software from modules. Stability is god.Random bitcoin trivia:First transaction is in block 170First standard transaction in block 728The first difficulty change was at block 32256Blocks 91842 and 91812, and, 91880 and 91722 contain the same duplicate coinbase transaction. The miners can only use that transaction once.http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000a4d0a398161ffc163c503763b1f4360639393e0e4c8e300e0caechttp://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000743f190a18c5577a3c2d2a1f610ae9601ac046a38084ccb7cd7212016 (amount of blocks for difficulty re-calculation) corresponds to exactly 2 weeks of 10 minute ideal blocks. 210k (amount of blocks for drop in mining reward) only roughly corresponds to 4 years.There was a forced fork in the blockchain a while back around 710k blocks when someone DoS bitcoin's scripting system using an excessive number of OP_CHECKSIGs. That's why IsStandard() exists today.Block 142312 was the first block to have a non-standard coinbase. I think this was one of luke-jr's blocks possibly since it follows his pattern of instant spend.block 546 spends a tx within the same block: 6b0f8a73a56c04b519f1883e8aafda643ba61a30bd1439969df21bea5f4e27e2 Ya joking?A scripting system inside a scripting system. Hacks on hacks on hacks will lead to a messier protocol than FTP is now.Well, it seems good at first glance. But fast-tracking this into the block-chain is probably not a wise idea. There's no rush so it might be prudent to think of this as something for 2 years time or later. Bitcoin is not exploding tomorrow, so there's no big loss from holding off on momentous changes like these.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0001That's a good place to start. Re-enabling parts of the old scripting system in a controlled manner is a good idea. Adding new operations- not so much *right* now. PID controllers are completely standard, and the reason to use them (from my experience) is that they can be very easily fine tuned to optimal cybernetic states.Can you explain your reasoning though for arguing that the difficulty adjustment is a PI controller? P = nActualTimespan / nTargetTimespan? Then where do you get the integral component from the difficulty re-calculation? To me it looks like a simple proportional scaling algorithm.

List your country and bank name and they should be able to guide you through. Don't let depression get you down. Some of the best people society has ever known suffered depression. One of my heroes, Thomas Henry Huxley, had acute depression throughout his entire life.Huxley was at the forefront of evolution with Darwin during the last century. Self-taught. autodidact. A boy who left school at ten became one of the most knowledgeable men in Britain. He reformed the entire education system in the UK and was responsible for turning biology from a hobby into a respectable profession.When Huxley himself was young there were virtually no degrees in British universities in the biological sciences and few courses. Most biologists of his day were either self-taught, or took medical degrees. When he retired there were established chairs in biological disciplines in most universities, and a broad consensus on the curricula to be followed. Huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation.Huxley founded the X Club which founded the journal Nature.Huxley's interest in education went still further than school and university classrooms; he made a great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds: after all, he himself was largely self-educated. There were his lecture courses for working men, many of which were published afterwards... and so was the free library organised by the college, an idea which was widely copied. Huxley thought, and said, that the men who attended were as good as any country squire. The technique of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which were sold to the general public was extremely effective... Its theme  that vital action is nothing more than "the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it"  shocked the audience.Sadly Thomas Henry Huxley suffered depression throughout his lifetime. Many others in his family were mentally ill. Several descendents from first to third generation of his suffered severe depresson, some committing suicide.You look really young. And there are still a huge amount of things that will happen in your life. Try to enjoy yourself. Just have fun  We live in incredible times. Everything is moving forwards quickly and we're a part of that, simply by participating in cyber-space. You might want to try MagicalTux on #mtgox Freenode IRC Where did you get that idea? Our offices are in London, and we have accounts for British GBP, European EURO and Polish Zloty.Info: https://intersango.com/fees.phpWe aren't allowed to let people easily convert between funds as that's forex trading. runeks, you should open a ticket on Intersango by emailing support@intersango.com and then someone will respond to solve your issue. It's better that way as we can better track tasks and assign them to the correct people appropriately. Firmly against the idea.I support free speech. But don't want a search engine in bitcoin.I support Esperanto. But don't want bitcoin to be in Esperanto by default.I support free DNS. But don't want namecoin attached to bitcoin.Bitcoin is strictly money. We all have diverse ideas and points of view- that's what makes us exciting. But expanding bitcoin anywhere beyond it's narrow focus would serve to be a flashpoint and source of contention, and negatively affect the project. I'm surprised nobody is taking advantage of all this free money out there to be made between exchanges.We placed a priority on developing on API to enable bots to do trading for this very reason.There are no fees and we have good support. Intersango accepts USD, EUR and GBP.There's basically easy money to be made from the gaps in prices between exchanges and even inside exchanges.Here's some Python code to find the USD <-> whatever exchange rate using Google:Code:def query_fiat_rate(conn, currency):    conn.request("GET", "/search?q=1usd+to+"+currency)    response = conn.getresponse()    html = response.read()    match = re.search('<b>1 U[.]S[.] dollar = ([0-9.]*) [A-Za-z .]*</b>', html)    if match is not None:        return decimal.Decimal(match.group(1))    raise FiatRateNotFound(currency)import httplibconn = httplib.HTTPConnection("www.google.com")print query_fiat_rate(conn, 'EUR')Documentation for other exchanges APIs can be found on their websites. Intersango API No updated news on an EU directive that is going to take months (if not years).BTW I should've said currency overlay, not overlay currency as someone correctly pointed out.I don't post often on the forums, so please direct your questions to me on IRC: genjix in #bitcoinconsultancy http://bitcoinmedia.com/london-mini-conference-raw-uncut-video-of-talSee there for details of how it went  Image on how branch deletion works: Hey John,I don't know if you've been following my project libbitcoin:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30646.0https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/libbitcoinI've been making good progress.Anyway I just wanted to say that you should try to make bitcoin-qt as generic as possible wherever you can with replaceable backends. That means in the future you'll have more developers focused around developing one GUI (and pooling effort) rather than many competing clients running in parallel. I haven't been checking the forums so much since there seemed to be more discussion on the mailing list.I actually changed the name before to BRC (Bitcoin Request for Comments) which I prefer, but since people here like BIP I've changed the name.Name isn't too important as long as the process is there and respected https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_ProposalWiki is not a bad place for having these proposals up, but it would be a good idea to have these backed up in a secondary location on github.com/bitcoin/bips/ This is not a big deal and completely standard in open source communities. We all love the software and so try to find ways to work on it full time. http://bitcoinmedia.com/nice-spot-on-dutch-tv All are welcome in our faith.Every 9am at the call to coders, we turn face to Linux and worship the one true Coin while chanting our mantra "all software must be free and all information wants to be free". We have sworn to a life of celibacy. Our skin, softened from decay, burns in sunlight. We eschew food and exercise.For a new race shall silently conquer the world. Neither human, nor animal. The geek shall inherit the Earth.Free beer too. Seriously. You all bitch and complain about how terrible things are. Get out there. It's easy to procrastinate or criticize. Unless you're taking action or working 14+ hours a day to better things then you should feel bad. Bitcoin will always be around and frankly that isn't a valid cop-out now.I swear I would drop everything I'm doing now if I wasn't on the other side of the globe.If you are remotely near NYC then you have no excuse. We're trying. Hopefully it might work out but there's some factors that can conspire against us making recordings.We just added Zarren Spry (LinuxCoin) to the 1 hour workshops on the second day! That's untrue. We've already invested 100k into our bitcoin operations and are continuing strong. I'm personally liable for any lost funds if the company should ever go bankrupt. I'm willing to back that statement up with a legal contract (up to a certain amount that I would be able to realistically pay off working over 2 years).No business is risk-free. Yes, risky businesses have higher profits, but they also have higher volatility and there's always the sudden chance of them going bust overnight. We're very risk averse for that reason since it scares the shit out of me that we could wake up and have lost everyone's money. Then we'd have no means to pay people back if you look at past examples like bitomat, mtgox, mybitcoin, .etc I adapted the Python PEP 0001 to Bitcoin (its license is public domain):https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Enhancement_Proposalshttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BEP_0001BEP 0001 is open to additional authors and revisions.Ideally these should go in a github.com/bitcoin/beps/ repo.Lets have a standardisation track for changes to the protocol.

We already have an amazing roaster of contributions lined up. Everyone's quite excited about this event; there have been very few Bitcoin contributor meetings so far, even outside the UK. We'll try to record the talks and will make the videos public.We're now ready to announce details.It's a weekend of talks, discussions and workshops for Bitcoin contributors, domain experts from a wide range of fields, enthusiasts, and everyone curious about Bitcoin. This is a great chance for everyone to meet new people and learn new things.We will discuss the code, the infrastructure, the community, the legal and political implications; we will look into the mechanisms of currency systems, security concerns of running Bitcoin infrastructure, and run workshops that show you how to participate.As the Bitcoin community grew it has become harder to separate hype from fact, charlatans from helpful guides. We will attempt to bring clarity, and to critique the Bitcoin system and community with a sober attitude. Though it's also worth pointing out that any social experiment worth having requires a fair amount of anarchy, playfulness, and suspension of disbelief...The event will happen over a weekend:* Saturday, 24 Sept 2011 from 14:00-18:00 we will have talks and discussions.* Sunday, 25 Sept 2011 from 14:00-18:00 we will have workshops. Thanks to the London Hackspace the event itself is free to attend, however you need to register so we know how many people to expect. Make sure to register early; we will make an attempt at managing a waiting list should that become necessary.

Lets have a free for all and see what cool things people make Cya  This was more like ponzi scheme than casino. Both require some degree of lying, but the former requires downright dishonesty. this opens a can of worms. i could find the entire balance of a site if i can deposit/withdraw with 0 confirms by cycling all the keys in there wallet.also you can replace transactions using the sequence invalidating your old tx.not a good idea I just committed a postgres function to calculate difficulty:Code:DROP DOMAIN IF EXISTS target_type CASCADE;CREATE DOMAIN target_type AS NUMERIC(68, 0) CHECK (VALUE <= 26959535291011309493156476344723991336010898738574164086137773096960 AND VALUE >= 0);CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION extract_target(bits_head INT, bits_body INT) RETURNS target_type AS $$    BEGIN        RETURN bits_body * (2^(8*(CAST(bits_head AS target_type) - 3)));    END;$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION difficulty(bits_head INT, bits_body INT) RETURNS target_type AS $$    BEGIN        RETURN extract_target(CAST(x'1d' AS INT), CAST(x'00ffff' AS INT)) / extract_target(bits_head, bits_body);    END;$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;So if you want to calculate the total difficulty of the block chain you can do:SELECT SUM(difficulty(bits_head, bits_body)) FROM blocks WHERE depth IS NOT NULL;Total blockchain difficulty is: 20077745448You can play around with that syntax to select certain amounts of blocks:SELECT SUM(difficulty(bits_head, bits_body)) FROM blocks WHERE depth > 400 AND depth <= 500;.etc have fun I uploaded a postgresql dump of the database: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=38246.0 No, don't worry. The conversation is informative. I have no problems if people want to talk about tangential topics here I uploaded a postgresql dump of the database: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=38246.0 reload Using libbitcoin's poller program, I've downloaded all of the bitcoin network database in postgresql for anyone interested.Here is a dump of the bitcoin database (all blocks, transactions, scripts, ...): http://libbitcoin.org/bitcoin-sql.tar.bz2 Why would I advise you whether your patch is good or not when the evidence points towards it being a scam.I had a friend who heavily invested in IxCoin when it first came out, and I kept urging him to buy out ASAP... Nonetheless he has now lost cash.Good job scammer. Die in a grease fire. Thanks.I'm disconnecting from the forums for a few days to focus. I can be contacted using my email on the front of bitcoin.org Thanks.I'm disconnecting from the forums for a few days to focus. I can be contacted using my email on the front of bitcoin.org
For now it has a very low level api, but in the future we obviously fix that like you have pyKDE built upon KDE built upon Qt built upon X built upon the kernel graphics stack Anyway, I'm disconnecting from the forums for a few days to focus. I can be contacted using my email on the front of bitcoin.org done! I'm not so sure that it's good to prune out the previous_output_hash since when getting an entire block, you want the entire info (which includes the hashes)- especially for displaying on a block explorer type website, hashing the transaction or performing the OP_CHECKSIG .etcThe fact is that you'll be looking up the previous hash so often that it'd be a wasted optimisation and not gain too much either (storage is cheap today). Also impact on performance is minimal since we've got fetching blocks down to being blindingly FAST.There could be merit in updating the previous_transaction_id field when you connect the blocks, but I can't see a use case that often for cycling *backwards* in the blockchain (forwards yes, but not backwards). You only really look backwards once - during the initial block-chain verification which doesn't quite warrant the effort of adding this field. I plan to add a flag indicating whether an output is_final (and the parent transaction is_final - if all child outputs all have is_final set) and an output_address and for transaction a transaction_type (standard, generated and other) fields.Also will be another table with chain_id, cumulative_difficulty... and cumulative difficulty in blocks.For now still working on the block chain verification specifics (which algorithm is best and whether to organize then verify, pre-verify then organize then verify, or verify then link and organize). There are various pros and cons for all the different ways. I'll probably add cumulative difficulty into the blocks very soon.Still thinking about various design issues though. Are you on IRC? You should hit me up on #bitcoinconsultancyYou can quickly query the total difficulty for a chain using a single SQL command:SELECT SUM(to_difficulty(bits_head, bits_body)) FROM blocks WHERE span_left=X AND span_right=X;Will give you the total difficulty in chain X (you have to have to_difficulty() defined as: bits_body * 2^[8*(bits_head - 3)] ) I'm still working on ProcessBlock (verifying the blocks) and everything below it (ConnectBlock/DisconnectBlock). You can see an example of how the span works in src/storage/postgresql_storage.cpp:reorganize_block_chain()... That function will be moved internally and within verify_block under include/bitcoin/verify.hppIndeed you're correct that all the spans of the parents would have to be incremented if you fork the block chain. This is OK since it can be done in a simple single UPDATE, inserting a new block is an infrequent operation (doesn't have to be as fast as SELECTs) and it's not a big deal if adding a new block isn't immediate.Far more important is the select speed. If you run the poller and postgres benchmark:Code:$ ./bin/examples/poller dbname dbuser dbpass localhost:8333... wait to download all the blocks$ make psql$ time ./bin/tests/psql... run benchmark to fetch 100 blocksWith my current setup it takes 10 secs to fetch 100 blocks or 0.1 secs for 1 block. That means 4 hours to fetch the entire block-chain of 140k blocks. Using a rule of thumb that verifying the block-chain will be 10 times as slow, that might mean 40 hours to verify all 140k blocks. ATM I plan to just bundle the first 120k pre-verified blocks in the code, then later see about optimising this.But I am running it over a VPS on rackspace, so that also could be a reason for the speed too.It should be possible for you to easily modify the current storage engine I'm using to enable sqllite... The library supports multiple backends. See the constructor in src/storage/postgresql_storage.cpp:postgresql_storage() ... The sql_ object is being explicitly initialised with postgresql parameters. I don't mind making this a generic sql_storage backend if you're able to get it to work The current way of joining the blocks using reorganize_block_chain() will be removed and done as part of the block-chain verification- that's the best way I see currently to do it... But I am doing more research of the current bitcoin sourcecode to make sure I understand everything fully. The current bitcoin is very inefficient/obtuse and there's a whole bunch of ways to do things quicker or nicer. Thought you might find this info useful:Just wanted to point out my project here (libbitcoin): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30646.0Making great progress and it's functional. There's a working application in examples/poller.cpp that simply downloads the bitcoin blocks + transactions + everything into postgresql so you can inspect it. Someone could easily throw a web gui around this and...voila! blockexplorer clone https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/blobs/master/examples/poller.cpp Yep, I would reduce it to a single forum so all the posts could be aggregated there. Then expand with more subforums as needed.Also would be nice to see bitcoin.org.uk as a UK portal instead of a forum:- UK news- Links to UK bitcoin groups (Britcoin and Bitcoin Consultancy for instance - Map of users UK wide.etcEverybody speaks English so there isn't too much demand for a UK forum like there is with the Polish one. More important is to link up and find out what's happening wrt Bitcoin in my homeland  Just wanted to point out my project here (libbitcoin): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30646.0Making great progress and it's functional. There's a working application in examples/poller.cpp that simply downloads the bitcoin blocks + transactions + everything into postgresql so you can inspect it. Someone could easily throw a web gui around this and...voila! blockexplorer clone https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/blobs/master/examples/poller.cpp You have to start somewhere. I had none of those in the beginning, slowly accumulated them and now we have that and more. I'd rather people see this here before more people jump in on this. Already people have been buying lots of them and wasting mining power on generating them. No, check CreateNewBlock. It calculates the value using GetBlockValue which doesn't hard limit the value to 21 million. This means that the network will break overnight once it reaches 21 million. Hey,IxCoin simply has increased the reward for each block from 50 to 96. That means that every 4 years the reward halves so it should eventually reach 42 million.However the hard coded max value in the code is 21 million. There are checks (see MoneyRange and ProcessBlock) in the source code which haven't been changed to still limit it to 21 million.Once it reaches 21 million, all new blocks minted by miners (which are still using the same reward) will be all rejected and the network will shut down overnight.Reasons I now think it's a scam after playing with it:- They only made one minor modification to the source code (changing 50 -> 96)- Already mined 400k IxCoins themselves.- Copied and leveraged bitcoin community with minimal input. Product doesn't have much value on its own.- wallet.dat is 52mb already. Within a year that will be 3gb. This is not sustainable in terms of computer resources.Initially I was ambivalent about them, but after talking with the other guys here (at Bitcoin Consultancy), it's looking like a classic pump and dump.IxCoin: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=36218.0Also all the devs on the front page of bitcoin.org (me included), got this message: nefario is also a great choice.My votes: nefario and sgornick We discussed here, and our general idea would be to move our site's repo off that project on gitorious and open that repo on gitorious to be open to the community.If everybody wants that. This thread was started as the result of a conversation between me and MagicalTux on IRC. The wiki currently only has me, MagicalTux, nanotube and Kiba as admins, and we're busy that we don't get time to do the necessary cleanup always. As a long term administrator of the wiki since it's inception, I'm going to nominate sgornick on his behalf.He has been active in the community and is well trusted as the owner of bitcoinnews.com and bitcoinminer.com among his other sites (his projects are listed at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/User:Sgornick).He's been proactive with fighting spam and adding new info to the wiki, and enabling him with the tools he needs is not a bad decision. Done! BTW, if you have a repo and tell me certain commits that may be useful then we can pull them into the master  Generally the gbp branch is more up to date and newer... I keep trying to migrate things over but occasionally forget but phantom won't let me delete the master branch -_- since he says others should use it.Anyway I copied over more bank stuff for you,https://gitorious.org/intersango/intersango/commits/masterYou should mainly be interested in import_csv_hsbc.pyIt imports CSV files by accounting for overlap and duplicate entries.phantom also wrote the parse_deposits.py which searches for anything that looks like the deposit reference on that line.Hmmm, might be a good idea for v2 that the deposit reference starts with DPsk32jkjs to make finding it easier, and then a script that generically finds the amount somehow... It would be cool if we're not the only stewards but we have lots of groups collaborating, pushing and pulling from each other to build a repository of scripts up for dealing with all the different bank variants and so forth.

Keeping your backups on the same server is absurd. The cool thing for me, is that by and large, the economy is mostly legit and people are honest. There have been some major dumb mistakes, but that's mostly due to bumbling incompetence rather than outright dishonesty.My guess is that the mybitcoin guy simply fucked up (was cracked) and disappeared. Hey,This channel is the best! It's like the future... they are really helpful and give out medical advice. It's super cool.Anyway I got them to help accept bitcoins yesterday for helping me out. They really know their stuff, and it's really nice of them to provide this free service, so show your support by lurking there  hmmm i don't usually buy presents. they usually both buy me stuff Somalia has improved on several economic indicators but suffered on none under lawlessness. It seems many of the major problems with Somalia are to do with religious extremists and outside forces.However many Somalis themselves are supportive of having a central government. You can read accounts of people talking about lack of safety .etc So I don't know.

I don't know what I'd do.Maybe let him know that it's immoral and wrong what he's doing. I assume you already did. I'm still halfway through understanding part 4, and it's super cool that you're brainstorming these ideas so I don't want you to think any criticism is because I find them worthless- au contraire. Hopefully we'll arrive at good tools in time. I like the idea of shared wallets that require everyone's permission to spend the funds.Example 3: Assurance contracts. In Las Vegas the casinos around this river, agreed to fund bridges. People like to walk the length of them, and so the casinos all found it advantageous to build these bridges to allow people to cross over and walk back down the over side (and maybe gamble more). That works well.The thing with funding public good, is that it doesn't scale. Once it's 1000 people, one guy might try to see if he can get away with not paying up if he sees that everyone else would still be willing to go along with funding it themselves.Instead I'd try to frame this for when projects want to crowd-source funding and need X in order to continue. i.e Pioneer One asking for $25k to fund their series. There are lots of these on the bitcoin forums (I pledge 1 BTC for this initiative!) but it'd be an incremental improvement to not have to chase down all those people once the goal is reached, and to know how much is actually pledged. ATM it's a very basic library. You can construct transactions and send them over the network. Also you can download blocks/txs and partially verify scripts.What's missing mainly is the transaction abstraction engine.TODO:phase 2:- OP_CHECKSIGphase 3:- EC keypair generating- High level construction of transactions.- session class (session->connect();  session->send_funds("1djkj3jk3kj3k", 1000000000); session->get_balance(); .etc)phase 4:- Lastly would be to make a gui, but I'm hoping others will build them as this library becomes more mature.- Fully complete scripting engine that isn't disabled.As you can see, ATM it's 0.1alpha release.Progress can be followed at, https://bitcoinconsultancy.com/wiki/index.php/Libbitcoin#Roadmap hehe, very interesting article. Predictable that it came from Mike.  Can someone give me some use cases for them? Having a hard time imagining how they could be used.Thanks
Sadly I don't see how this could be implemented either :/ I'd rather keep humans out of the loop as much as possible.Using the 2 currencies for affecting the price using market forces is an interesting concept though. Might be cool some way in the future when we have multiple coin variants. There's also libbitcoin, which aims to rewrite bitcoin, make it super-pluggable, very easy to do and hack everything at every level, and very configurable:http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=30646.0https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/libbitcoinAnd don't forget justmoon's javascript bitcoin which is based off of BitcoinJ:https://github.com/justmoon/node-bitcoin-p2p/ You should consider giving us the sources to these pics too. I'm going to be going through all the OP_CHECKSIG code soon with a fine comb and I'll probably have corrections to add to your images. Tada! http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=30646 Hey thanks.Definitely going to use this in my project: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=30646(check it out Maybe you have some code samples to share? Maybe there is some merit to storing the script as:"dup hash160 [1a 4b ... data ... ff 65] equalverify checksig"And parsing them in and out.The primary reason I stored them the way I do is because that's how they're represented internally:https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/blobs/master/include/bitcoin/script.hpp Thanks. This was extremely awkward situation for me. I've done a bunch of interviews already but this was quite weird :pIt was extremely hot, uncomfortable stool and the microphone voice was very loud "hey could you turn down that microph-" "AND WE'RE ON IN 3! 2! 1! WELCOME TO ..."OK, but that's dealable, but the awkward part was having no visual feedback. I was basically doing a telephone interview where everybody could see me. Check out this email exchange:Me:Them:Me:Anyway I'm pleased it turned out fine in the end though. Our group is making great progress on our bitcoin projects. We just tonight released a bitcoin rewrite http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=30646.0 and new exchange software is coming soon too also  Yeah the C++ API is the default, but I want to provide something for C users too later. And also Ruby, Perl, Python, Java .etc through SWIG bindings. A document describing the rationale behind the database structure.AxiomsStarting with these basic rules, we design our database.     * Blocks are mostly sequential.    * Blocks contain a list of transactions.    * Transactions contain a list of inputs + outputs.    * Blocks can be free floating (orphan blocks).    * Transactions can be free floating (not yet in a block).    * There is one sequence of events that we accept as the truth at any one time.From big to small:     * Blocks    * Transactions    * Inputs    * Outputs    * Scripts    * OperationsBlock-chainThe block-chain is a series of blocks chained on in a linear sequence. The block-chain is an append only database of all transactions in the network.What's accepted as true, is the chain with the highest difficulty. Difficulty is computed using a function from the 'bits' field of the block. Given an entire chain, we can calculate the difficulty using:Code:    SELECT SUM(COMPUTE_DIFFICULTY(bits)) FROM our_chain;Occasionally this chain of events may be conflicting when the chain splits in half because there are two next rival blocks trying to append to the current chain. Always, the chain with the highest cumulative difficulty is preferred over the others.It can happen that more blocks build on a chain that previously had lower difficulty and so take over the main chain. This is termed a block-chain re-organisation. But as more blocks build off the main chain, that becomes exponentially less likely until eventually it becomes a near impossibility. Branches off the main block-chain can be pruned once they reach a certain depth that it's near unlikely they will ever become the main branch again.We can represent our blocks using this schema:Code:blocks:    block_id    block_hash    depth       -- block number in the chain    span_left    span_right    ... other fieldsCode:block_id  depth  span_left  span_right0  0  0  31  1  0  32  2  0  23  2  3  34  3  3  35  3  0  26  4  3  37  4  0  08  5  0  09  4  1  210  5  1  211  6  1  212  6  0  013  7  0  014  8  0  015  7  1  116  7  2  2In the diagram above blocks are represented by black dots. The block_id is a unique identifier for each new block inserted into the database. Each of the dots above would have a unique block_id.Depth is the vertical number on the left, and is synonymous with a block's block-number.Span left and right indicates the range of chains that a block exists in. A block with a span_left of 0, and a span_right of 3, would exist in chains 0, 1, 2 and 3. Using a span, we can easily select a particular chain:Code:    SELECT * FROM blocks WHERE span_left=0 AND span_right=0;Or select the common point between a series of chains:Code:    SELECT MAX(depth) FROM blocks WHERE span_left>=0 AND span_right<=2;Once span_right starts to exceed a value (say 10) and the depth since the chain forked exceeds a certain value, then that chain can be pruned:Code:    DELETE FROM blocks WHERE span_left=10 AND span_right=10;The total span range of all blocks should equal all the number of stored chains. If we have a span of [0, 10] then there should be 11 spans from 0 to 10. A table exists to keep track of all the chains.Code:blockchains:    chain_id    max_depth    last_block_id    total_difficultyTransactionNothing unusual happens here, except that transactions can be included more than once in multiple chains. A seperate table exists to track the parents for a transaction.Code:transaction_parents:    transaction_id    block_id    index_in_blocktransactions:    transaction_id    transaction_hash    ... other fieldsoutputs:    parent_id       -- transaction parent    index_in_parent    output_type     -- normal, generated, other    address    ... other fieldsinputs:    parent_id    index_in_parent    previous_output_id    ... other fieldsScriptA script consists of a serious of opcodes and optional data.Code:script_id_type = SEQUENCEoperations:    operation_id    script_id    code    dataA typical script might appear like:Code:operation_id  script_id  code  data132  45  dup  NULL133  45  hash160  NULL134  45  special  89 ab cd ef ab ba ab ba ab ba ab ba ab ba ab ba ab ba ab ba135  45  equalverify  NULL136  45  checksig  NULLTo fetch the script:Code:    SELECT * FROM operations WHERE script_id=45 ORDER BY operation_id ASC;Broadcasted inventoriesThis will be stored in memory for now as there are potential attack vectors to serialising inv items. An attacker could cause many disk read/writes by spamming a host potentially. More thought needs to go into this later.Main block-chainA convenience table is provided for the end user to read the block-chain transaction history. It contains the currently accepted version of the truth. It provides a way for the user to quickly query transactions and see funds in addresses.The inputs and outputs are joined in a view. All the outputs which are final and have not been spent, would have no equivalently joined on input. This is the inner core which consists of a bunch of subsystems co-operating over clearly defined interfaces.As an example one such message could command the block_chain_manager to create a transaction. It then sends the new transaction to the network component to actualise it.The inner core is very difficult to use so we abstract it's usage to a more usable outer core. Think of the inner core like X-windows and outer core an easy to use GUI toolkit like Qt (by analogy).Into the core we can switch in and out different components. In this example we choose to replace a MySQL serialiser/de-serialiser with an SQLite one. Maybe there could also be in-memory serialisers (never store to disk) or whatever.A serialiser takes in a data object and then stores it. The type of component decides where + how it looks when stored. When reading the object it de-serialises in reverse.The whole point is not to just dump binary blobs into MySQL rows but to put them there in a readable format so an admin can dissect them in case of problems. We also will only create a MySQL serialiser for the time being unless it's possible to use standard SQL and simultaneously support MySQL, PostgresSQL, SQLite.Above the diagram for the outer core indicated an exposed C api with auto-generated Swig bindings.We try to keep the core very simple and focused; no mining, no accounts, no GUI, no RPC server. These things can all be implemented in Python. Already genjix has Spesmilo as a Qt GUI using bitcoind that we can easily use since it has a special interface that can be re-implemented for whatever Bitcoin implementation. Accounts can be provided as a Python module or special plugin in C or C++.As another example, by being able to switch the networking component, we can replace it with a dummy networking component that is used for debugging.Or use one networking component for multiple instances of Bitcoin or other currencies.We try to split everything up as much as possible to help developers long term. It makes it easier for new contributors to get started. That's the free-software way: lots of components and clear separation to allow maintainers to work on their piece of turf.CallbacksA good plugin+component system is a must for this project. The core will probably have to be thread-safe if we use threads for networking. Otherwise an event system could be a bottleneck since we get the worst of both worlds.If we make a block-chain verifier subsystem, is there an object to making it one-shot (verify once or every X blocks the block chain in one go) or does it need to be after every block is downloaded?In any case, it would be nicer to be able to hook the verifier system to a generic callback as opposed to calling it manually in the code.boost::signals2 seems like a good choice to be considered, although it has to be seen whether there is any bottleneck. Also any callback system would have to be exposed in Python somehowRandom notes:    * Our main target is large scale deployments. Bitcoin Enterprise (utilising our libbitcoin). The Red Hat of Bitcoin, not the Ubuntu.    * Use boost::property_map?    * boost::asio is a good choice for networking.    * Externally we expose a C api for people that cannot program C++ but use C++ internally. A C ABI is also nice since it doesn't get mangled by the compiler.    * Status during initialisation for debugging/showing progress in GUI client. libbitcoin: Product of Calafou.

public. From what I've seen he isn't a bad person and is genuinely working on things. It's not nice to make personal attacks on people without first trying to see what's up.I could understand if he made a bad reply or something but cmon  OK, but more correct for:Code:To determine who 'swamps' who, we check whether:  $our->amount / $them->amountis greater or less than  $them->initial_want_amount / $them->initial_amount.Multiply both sides by $them->initial_amount and $them->amountshows that it's the same as checking whether:  $our->amount * $them->initial_amountis greater or less than  $them->initial_want_amount * $them->amountWould be to say that we're still using the same check as before:$our->amount >= $them->want_amountExcept that we're not relying on the inaccurate want_amount:$our->amount >= $them->amount * $them->initial_want_amount / $them->initial_amount$our->amount * $them->initial_amount >= $them->amount * $them->initial_want_amountWhich is the same as that end result above  I have this:      1) Ignore the 'want_amount' column when deciding how much to trade.  Only use the initially requested price and the amount column.      2) Update the 'want_amount' column for display only, based on the remaining 'amount' and the initially requested price.      3) Be more careful to process orders in the correct order.  Previously prices were truncated at 4 decimal places.      4) Use clearer variable names in pacman() rather than confusing 'our' and 'them'.      5) Don't match with orders before they are 'processed'.3) is done by using $order_by at the start of the fulfill_order main loop. 5) has the extra AND processed=TRUE in the matching orders select statement. 4) filled = us and partial = them and 2) I'm not too concerned about if there's a bug since it's only a display thing and easily fixable.That just leaves 1)... which I have to see actually works and test a whole bunch. Sorry this was my fault. I was supposed to be working on this before we transferred exchange development. At which point this task wasn't re-assigned to somebody.We've had much more serious bureaucratic problems which we've been rushing around to fix and keep the site operational. Things to do with banks.Everybody has been working on a new exchange platform that is supposed to be more secure, better designed and scalable. Development hasn't been focusing on maintaining the current software since it was hoped the new site would be out within 2 weeks, and then 2 weeks more .etcAnyway, I'm looking at this myself over the next few days. It's not as simple as just merging your fix, since I really need to go through everything with a fine toothed comb, run test suites and make sure the algorithm is fully understood. Although from the previous work we paid you for, your patches were good. atendu mian venantan elasadon dum sekvaj pluraj tagoj  Thanks right, we're still a free service and hope to be for a while until overhead catches up. Also we have maintained a very high level of security as our history with britcoin.co.uk shows. We try to answer support tickets twice a day. Some tickets which are harder to resolve however take longer. Hi guys. Just letting you know this was not a problem in the code. Merely a manually executed one-off mistake which only effected your account and your transaction. 
Some of those responses were OK and reasonable Thanks, but credit here doesn't go to me but phantomcircuit who handled this. He's in control of much of the site development nowadays. Use the bitcoind in that gitorious repo. Also you need to follow the instructions in INSTALL I don't understand you people. We have our exchange operating for several months, with a team of 6 people working on the software. TradeHill, Bitcoin7, bitomat, CampBX are all much more professional than mtgox too...And yet mtgox with super shoddy security (it's not even funny), many problems and people still stick with them?Blame yourselves. If you want the situation to change then vote with your $$$, otherwise things will never change. Frankly the situation is a bit ridiculous. That's fine. As long as they don't use more than:OP_PUSHDATA1OP_PUSHDATA2OP_PUSHDATA4OP_DUPOP_DROPOP_HASH160OP_EQUALVERIFYOP_CHECKSIG(for the time being at least ) Hhahaha! That's why IsStandard exists Are those 3 the only non-standard transactions? They're very old it seems.Thanks for that.EDIT: How did that transaction not fail? OP_CHECKSIG pops twice from the stack and after the first pass, the stack would be 0 and then fail. OK, that sounds reasonable (leaving them in as an option). Sorry but OpenID really does comprise a majority of our support tickets. And people blame us when google changes their OpenID or MyOpenID goes down, they login and have 0 funds. Nearly always people think we've stolen their funds or made a mistake. We have no office But for now we're in very formative stages. Generally coding remote works great when everybody knows what needs to be done. Now, it's less than ideal. Coding together on location means you get a lot of face to face dialogue and discussion, and you move forwards because you have your group's guidance and are there to do this task. Are we talking about a huge list here or just a select few?If not, would someone link a random selection of them?Anything that uses more than:OP_PUSHDATA1OP_PUSHDATA2OP_PUSHDATA4OP_DUPOP_DROPOP_HASH160OP_EQUALVERIFYOP_CHECKSIG Yep, well OpenID is so incredibly poor that we're switching to proper logins when we release the new version of our exchange software. I agree, but would you rather a government says bitcoin is used by child molesters or terrorists, or they say here are our legal requirements?Project is on site for now  Maybe in the distant future we will do the remote thing once we have contributors to the projects to support. Hi,I noticed that BitcoinJ doesn't verify non standard transactions. Are there any non standard transactions in the current block chain?When I say standard transactions, I mean only[sig] [pubkey] OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubkeyhash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGAnd,[sig] [pubkey] OP_CHECKSIGThanks How do you exchange coins to other people? Interested how the algorithm works.Do you have to trust the person you're exchanging with? How does it ensure that Barry doesn't steal Linda's funds after she sends first? Is this a web of trust (exchange part) running over i2p (decentralised)?Bad news: web of trust systems don't scale. SEPA transfer times usually take around 3 days. No organisation or categories. Filled with spam and other junk. A properly organised place is better than forums. Hey,From my experience, one of the nicest uses of bitcoins that we want to promote is paying people for 'micro-jobs'.Lets put a new section on the front page of bitcoin.org on the right hand side below Community like:Jobs* Job listings boardThe board can be on the wiki or an existing site. One nice one I've been playing around with is, http://bitgigs.com/Be promoting the use of bitcoins as a method for paying people for small online jobs, we show that bitcoin is a bit more than for buying drugs or speculating on mtgox. It's how I got interested with bitcoins in the first place  by making small amounts of BC for below minimum wage. It's also a neat way to connect people and help the economy flow better. Hey,Anybody interested in working with the Bitcoin client fulltime? Below I've posted the job posting. Getting paid to work on Bitcoin fulltime with other skilled & enthusiastic developers fulltime here in Poland    #bitcoinconsultancy on Freenode <-- feel free to drop in and say hi   http://bitcoinconsultancy.com/We're currently a group of 6 passionate people from Europe/UK/US (with more to come soon) that wants to push Bitcoin forwards. We'll give preference to applicants with previous contributions to Bitcoin or other free software projects.Eventually we hope to pay the entire Bitcoin community, but for now we're still in the growth stage. Afterwards we can then provide a foundation to help people in the future by organising conferences, helping with legal advice wrt bitcoin or helping court costs .etcOur strategy for bitcoin acceptance is:1) pay people to work on bitcoin. Bitcoin can only develop as a secure, scalable and stable piece of software with fulltime developers.2) get business interests financially invested. In the case of an attack on the network, they will have their hands in the cookie jar and be financially motivated to defend bitcoin.3) set a positive legal precedent. When a government comes to look at bitcoin, they will be far more likely to rule positively if they see a long running, legal, honest and regulated exchange. That way we become the policy makers, not misinformed senators.4) aggressively dispel ignorance through the press. Ties in with 3)5) provide a platform to enable people to keep doing their work.Apologies for the long rant. If anyone has any other skills they can offer apart from C++ coder below then still feel free to message me. Maybe we could accommodate you still in some form, although we have a lot of offers from skilled developers and it's hard :p (we're still expanding).About Warsaw:- Very safe- We live in the town centre near the historic area.- Travel info- Hot girls, good links with rest of Europe, large linux group, major european cultural centre .etc------------------------------------------Network Programming - C++, LinuxRecruiter: Bitcoin ConsultancyLocation: Warsaw, PolandSalary: Salary negotiableJob Type: Minimum 4 months.

We are the maintainers of the only UK exchange with a daily tradingvolume of $20k. Our group has been featured in most of the major news publications.http://bitcoinconsultancy.com/ To echo the guy above, it's well worth reading Jane Jacobs and New Urbanism on Wikipedia. One good book is called 'The Option of Urbanism'
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area#MisconceptionsI know from certain special Corporate to other special Corporate accounts there are free transfers but I am not sure if there are other free transfers which people will be able to make use of. I see that there are probably ones in countries who have EUR as their standard currency. I will look into this further.As of right now receiving a SEPA transfer on our end is generally less than $2 (and a minimum of .25%... so if you are sending 800$ it actually would cost $2. There is a maximum of around 180PLN~$68, but this is if you are sending over $27,000). I will open an account in another country if it is advantageous. As of now our service is free as well.Our developers are all here in Poland which is why we opened the bank account in Poland. I saw already that there are other EUR exchanges such as btcex or bitcoin7... Wondering why they aren't used much.Possibly people just use mtgox. We'll have to wait and see. Fix'd. This is our European EU exchange.Britcoin is still the UK exchange. Send them to support@britcoin.co.ukWe're also working on a new site (more secure, better design to add new features) to be rolled out soon. Press CTRL + F5 if site graphics haven't been updated. That's my point. It's totally insignificant as far as I'm concerned, and the exchange operator could absorb that cost if need be. Also when phantom says 'rounding', he means to the 8th decimal place. I'm of the opinion that it's totally insignificant and we can make up those prices ourselves. It's unavoidable when you do 2 integer divisions that don't exactly go, and you get a remainder- what to do with it?for instance, if the rounding is less than 0.000 000 01 and we get 1 million trades a year (optimistic) then that'd be 0.01We round up for the person and absorb that cost ourselves. So the parties involved get more money than they asked for.We could even increase the number of decimals internally to make that rounding error smaller. There are no hacks. Check the commit logs. Thanks Ali https://gitorious.org/intersango/bitcoindI recommend this version of Bitcoin for people.Uses strings ("100000000") instead of doubles (1.0) for the RPC interface.And listreceivedsince <timest> RPC call.It's far better to keep polling for new received payments/sent payments, import them into your database and then act on it. Using bitcoin internal accounts is very bad in general. You need our special bitcoin, https://gitorious.org/intersango/bitcoind This is awesome! ^^ I'm definitely using this in my project as a guide if anything. We were under-reporting our volume to bitcoinwatch/charts Thanks to dooglus, we fixed a bug where our trades were dropping 0s on the end in our volume.New exchange is coming along nicely. We will be in a feature lock-down soon and start a week long bug fixing mode. Hey,You should email support@britcoin.co.uk so that it can go through the proper channels... I get too many messages everywhere and forget about them otherwise. If you email that, then our team can properly answer you  Ah yes, I forgot about the checkpoints. Basically if presented with 2 transactions then miners can randomly choose which to include in a block (if using the same outputs). The only condition is that the tx they include mustn't use the same outputs as a tx already in a block.So you send out tx A with no fee, and tx B with a fee + lock time.Two scenarios:1.  tx A gets included in a block before tx B's locktime finishes. By the time tx B becomes active, tx A is already in a block so it gets dropped.2. tx A never gets into a block. tx B becomes active + gets into a block. tx A is forgotten. Hi,What happens if there's a fork really deep?getdata uses CBlockLocator for the starting hashes. If presented with an ending hash deep enough in the chain, then it will return blocks starting from that forked point in CBlockLocator. However re-requesting the next chunk of blocks (after the first 500 on the forked branch) won't happen because the difficulty hasn't increased enough yet to cause an internal block chain reorganisation and become the new main chain.This seems to be the case since the starting point for getdata is always the head of the best chain in the code.I guess this is one of those astronomically unlikely scenarios that it's not a worry. In that case it might be a point to artificially limit the amount of start hashes in getdata and save some bandwidth. There are already checkpoints in Bitcoin.Also orphan blocks aren't verified unless there's a block chain re-organisation. At which point the block chain is invalidated from where it forks and the entire thing is recalculated from there. haha too funny
yep, it was done a little afterwards since phantom forgot to do it. lol joepie is so obviously not lulzsec. dumbasses. You're right, we do ignore the want field. It's mostly left for display and is kind of redundant. It's not even needed.  Ahh, I meant to actually say 0.5 instead of 2.5... But your reasoning is valid and correct. I updated the document in the repo :p (although it's no longer true since you fixed it) Merged dooglus's gitorious branch after testing it today.  This is wrong since it uses the initial_amount and initial_want_amount to calculate the exchange rate you set. The amount left that you want is more for display purposes and isn't used internally. Thanks dooglus for your help. We sent you 10 BC for your help After some testing, we're going to pull that change.Did you get my email dooglus? Your wallet or blockchain db is probably corrupted. backup wallet, delete folder and see if it works. otherwise use bitcointools to try to recover your wallet if you have no backup https://gitorious.org/intersango/Britcoin Not on his twitter, http://twitter.com/#!/lulzsecprobably impostor Mi afisxis pri Bitmono antaux multaj jaroj, http://eo.lernu.net/komunikado/forumo/temo.php?t=7710Kaj plu antaux tiam sed neniu rigardis multe   Nun ni havas pli da esperantistoj cxi tie Ne parolu iomete da lojbano. Tiu lingvo malbonas kaj malbelaasssssss Yep. This will be fixed by the end of the day. We got the problem fixed. BTW is anyone in London and want to meet up later? We might get a pizza or something with a few other community members. There's no letter. It's been an ongoing thing with LLoyds for nearly 2 weeks now everyday. They think our business is too high risk for them, so we've been given a 30 day notice to move to another bank.Anyway, it's too difficult answering every small message here otherwise I/we won't get any work done. I think everything should be OK since we have several contingency plans already in place from before. The new setup will either be rescinding the LLoyds notice (somewhat likely) or registering under a sole trader before forming a new LL to move the account to. Currently Britcoin runs under the Bitcoin Consultancy umbrella, so we'd be maybe looking to form a new platform for Britcoin (either Britcoin or an exchange group under Intersango) and find a backer.I'm trying to stay away from backers if possible since that could mean turning the Britcoin platform into a 'product' rather than a service, and mean making the sourcecode closed. Wherever possible I want to stay away from making political decisions that negatively affect the quality of the site... But it might be something my hand will be forced to do. I've already been fighting a ton with everyone to keep this software as an open platform but it's exhausting. We have the new exchange in the works which we plan to roll out (intersango 2). I hope it's opensourced. The process I detail above *is* how the current exchange works.---------------Our bank says they no longer wish to do business with us (due to what we're dealing with), so we're required to move elsewhere in 1 month's time.Do not deposit into this LLoyds TSB bank account after 21st July. We will update the new details on the website, and add a new bank account soon. Even if you are an anarchist (as myself but not the rest of our group- we're a diverse bunch), you should still be pushing for regulation of exchanges.1) We're dealing with people's money. Do you realise that the banks hold people's funds? At any time if the government doesn't like us, they can make one phone call and pull the plug.2) Governments will eventually take a look at Bitcoin. If there is a good precedent, they are far more likely to make a positive ruling on Bitcoin than ban it. An honest, long-running, regulation abiding exchange sets a good example and allows us to take part in policy making decision rather than 60 year old guys in suits.3) Mainstream people like legal legitimate things. If you want Bitcoin adopted, we have to cater to them.Right now Bitcoin can go the way of the poker sites, or into mainstream acceptance. The poker sites all went offshore and were playing a game of cat and mouse for a long time by setting up these short lives payment services to get money on their sites.Eventually the US DOJ got pissed and shut them all down, seizing their domain names. This already tarnished industry now had all their secrets come out. The poker world is dominated by 4 big companies controlling > 90% of the industry. PokerStars was OK (the only trustworthy site with a 60% market share). Full Tilt Poker was offering 999% rakeback to their friends (you could lose and still earn money through these loyalty points- normal amount is 25%). Cereus network (owns AP/UB) only has $5 mil of the $54 mil of the player's funds. All the sites were apparently engaging in some way in money laundering, although I'm not sure how verifiable that rumour is.Is it your goal that Bitcoin become the sole preserve of money launderers and drug dealers, forever shunned from mainstream acceptance? Bitcoin has an immense power to positively transform the world and perform an amazing social good. If Bitcoin is made illegal, then all that good would disappear and only the shady things will continue... perhaps even proliferate.Also, we pay the cost for abiding by regulation, not you. Why would you be against something which ensures we're an honest operation? Something like mtgox would never have happened if they were properly abiding to regulations. People have lost a ton of money. Many laws suck hard. But why would you be against something that at least protects the consumer. Especially if we abide by it willingly.This is all about protecting Bitcoin. Why else are we pulling 14 hour days for months working around the clock... We interface with the financial system, and we want to play on their turf. They set the rules.We're the only exchange AFAIK that has opensourced our code, and contributes back software we write to the community. We don't only develop exchanges, but write other software too which is released for free. We use project funds to hire more community members to keep doing cool Bitcoin projects. I'm sorry that everything isn't perfect, but in the real world you have to make strategic compromises to allow things to move forwards for the benefit of all. Yep, it's a block of payments on the 13th that we're having trouble getting access to. Trying to fix that.I had to write this document for phantom & the new exchange we're all working on. You might all find this info useful:==============================How does order matching work?==============================When you place an order, it goes into the orderbook. Every new order is umarkedat first. It just gets filed to be processed.Every minute, cron kicks in and starts processing the orders. Each matched orderis marked with a flag indicating that it's been processed.For each order that is processed, we look to find other equivalent orders whichare open, want the currency we own, have the currency we want and have a rateequivalent to or better than us. Looping through the matching orders with noordering (we plan to fix that) we try to fulfill our order with the opposingorder. Each loop creates a new transaction that indicates a trade occuredbetween two users.We keep doing this until the entire order is fullfilled (order is closed) or werun out of matching orders; the remaining amount stays in the orderbook (orderis open).The fulfilling part checks to see if our order has a smaller depth than theother one. If so, our order is completed at their exchange rate and closed. Thematching finishes up.The other case is where we have a larger depth, and want to fulfill ourselfpartly using their order.    ...    Order 14: We are offering 10 GBP for 1 BC    ...    Order 18: They are offering 2.5 BC for 5 GBP    ...We need to calculate how much of our order will be chipped off, whilepreserving their exchange rate.    ...    Order 14-1: We are offering 5 GBP for 2.5 BC    Order 14-2: We are offering 5 GBP for 2.5 BC    ...We fulfill our order and close their order.    ...    Order 14-2: We are offering 5 GBP for 2.5 BC    ...A new transaction is created for record keeping purposes and the users funds areupdated accordingly.A better algorithm would firstly order the matching equivalent orders by bestprice first so we move up the orderbook, rather than select random matches.Secondly an improvement perform linear programming to find the optimised ratefor two given orders given the constraints- although that isn't too important.One minor addition would be to never accept orders where the want / offerdoesn't produce a perfectly divisible amount so we don't get these randomremainders that are credited to a random account once the order matching iscompleted.* See process_orders.php. pacman does the order fulfillment once the new amounts  are computed. The purpose of our group ( http://bitcoinconsultancy.com/ ) is to generate enough funds to support Bitcoin developers and drive Bitcoin forwards. About the payments in on the 13th... I see them online, but when we try to download the CSV file they aren't showing up.
Tell me about it. I must have aged by 10 years during these last few months due to dealing with this POS bank all the time. I'm a coder, not a bureaucrat. Put me back where I belong. A good 60% of my time overhead = dealing with the bank. What a waste. How are people supposed to work? And people ask me why Bitcoins are needed in the world when we have banks!!Seriously if you knew the amount of hassle we've had from banks... Not only for Britcoin, but to transfer funds to pay people... It's immense. I don't know. We sent the funds, and they show up in the bank statements, but people are claiming they haven't been received yet. Give us time to look into this. We called the bank last Thursday, Friday and this morning (Monday) but our relationship manager was always unavailable. They told us they were going to get back to us today by 5 but didn't call back. But tomorrow, I'll try to see what's up. We have a friend on the inside and he said he'll check out our case too. TradeHill is doing the correct thing here. This is totally standard.http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/10/19/the-twitter-id-shuffle-text-vs-numbers/ https://gitorious.org/intersango/Used on BritcoinWe're working on v2.0 of it too:http://bitcoinconsultancy.com/wiki/index.php/Intersango Due to the recent events at MTGox.com, we at Britcoin have decided tomove our servers to a new location. MTGox suffered an SQL injectionwhich means access to the site's funds were in the hands of themalicious hacker. As such, until we see evidence to the contrary, forsecurity reasons we are assuming that MTGox has none of it's client'sbitcoins. For this reason, we have withdrawn their access to our serversand the sensitive information on those servers.While our servers were separate, we were purchasing server space fromMagicalTux, the owner/operator of MTGox. We have already moved all ourcustomer bitcoins to a wallet which has newly been created and has thehighest measure of security possible. The GBP deposits of course arestill safe in our business bank account as well.We will put Britcoin up again as soon as possible, but only once we areconfident we have the highest level of security our users deserve. 1. Britcoin was never hacked.2. We have all the funds there.3. A team of 4 is working fulltime on the code: https://gitorious.org/intersango/ phantomcircuit added this to Britcoin already a few days ago,https://gitorious.org/intersango/intersango/blobs/master/www/index.php Thanks for your work on blockexplorer.

I had to leave 2 of our developers in charge of the site because these few days I'm in London speaking to the banks.Everything should be fixed now.

Thank you, that is much appreciated. I am not taking donations now though as that may have legal implications.Yesterday during the day, before the server change over, we processed all the deposits and withdraws. We are hoping to be able to do the same thing tomorrow during bank hours. Once we have fully switched servers, we plan to process deposits and withdaws daily during bank hours so that people in the UK will be able to deposit and have the funds in their account same day (if they deposit early in the day). Same for cashouts. We are really sorry for these delays. We are working full time to get this fixed. We have just moved servers and in the future we will be moving bank accounts. Although we are having some delays now, these switches are all being done to increase site security and to be able to seemlessly scale with future volume. Thank you for your patience.

Although we are having some delays now, these switches are all being done to increase site security and to be able to seemlessly scale with future volume. Thank you for your patience. Problem with your router and it's DNS caching. Yes the site is back up. All features are currently working. I thank everyone for their patience Yep. There's a robot that automatically fills out the fields, but still somebody has provide the authorisation codes to confirm the withdrawals to go through. OK site is back up now. Waiting for DNS to propagate.Server migration happens at midnight. Should take 4 hours. This was fixed 2 days ago due to an error on the bank's side. 3 hours hopefully.For the time being I've turned off the server because people reporting 0 balance are probably logging in with google. Google changes your OpenID string based on the domain name so the site thinks you're a new user.OpenID = lame. In the new exchange we're developing, OpenID will be gone.Once the domain is back up, the site will be re-accessible.From midnight onwards, it will be down until the migration to new servers is complete. The transfer mechanism for .co.uk is totally different to any other domain name.You don't use an authorisation code. You simply change the IPS tag from one registrar to another. And the new registrar doesn't know who the domain is going to.http://www.123-reg.co.uk/1and1.shtmlhttp://www.experienced-people.co.uk/1022-transfer-site-new-hosting/transfer-a-domain.htmWe started the transfer process at midnight but it's taken all night. One of our guys was woken up 3 times. Now we're just waiting for the DNS to propagate. Hey,Nothing bad has happened. What basically happened was that when I first setup Britcoin, a US company (BrainChild Products) gave me the resources to create an exchange since they were planning to setup a legalised exchange using my software (something we've been pushing hard for).Now we're consolidating everything under a single entity in order to get legal legitimisation for Britcoin (one of the conditions of our potential contract). To transfer ownership for a UK domain is different to other domains. Basically the owning company has to change the IPS tag and then relinquish control. Then we have to quickly snap up the domain on the other side.During that interval, somebody (a domain squatter) would be able to grab the domain. Therefore we had to keep secret during this domain name ownership transfer.Tonight the server will be down from midnight onwards for approximately 4 hours while we migrate our servers over. You can withdraw BTC from the site, but withdrawing GBP won't do anything and in fact might hinder the operating of the site. A little downtime was to be expected, since we're upgrading Britcoin to a more legitimate infrastructure (legally & technically). Hopefully this is the last non-smooth upgrade since there was no other way to do this non destructively for UK domain names. We were doing maintenance, backups .etc Back up now. Hey,If deposits bounce back then try again. Anything sent this morning will probably bounce, but everything is resolved now and they should go through again. Email me webmaster@britcoin.co.uk if you're still experiencing problems with bounced payments tomorrow and I'll personally call the bank again. I agree. It's so important to get Bitcoins out of US into the rest of the world. It's tooth and nail to keep this thing running and be writing emails all day and ringing government offices. Hey,From time to time the bank gets locked every few months. Last time was for a 25 GBP transaction despite such high deposits and volume. We're adding another staff to work on the exchange and hopefully these problems will be spotted instantly in the future.During the last 24 hours, people have been having trouble depositing because payments were rejected. Now that is sorted with the banks and everything seems fine. It is OK to deposit now into the account. Hey granrojo, I agree with you and that will be the new behaviour in the new version of Britcoin we are writing. Hey,For Britcoin we currently use a business account. Deposits are downloaded as a CSV file and parsed. Withdrawals are done by a javascript robot.Soon we will be gaining legal status, we're doing a rewrite of the software and have a security guy consulting to make the site super secure. I want to do everything properly all around. It's been hard work but everything is falling into place and we need the last piece of the puzzle.I cannot find a UK bank with an API. It's driving me nuts. Whoever I call has no idea, and corporate accounts are for businesses with > 5mil in turnover / year.- Can automate withdrawals and fetch deposits without human intervention using an API.- Immediate receiving of deposits.- Whenever a payment is made to somebody, it immediately updates the bank balance so we can compare to our own internal balance for book-keeping purposes.- Doesn't close on weekends (preferably).I don't need any crappy ePayment service. A bank with a reference field is perfectly adequate. It should be possible since bullionvault.com seems to have the same setup as us (bank deposit + name in reference field).If anyone knows any consultants to call then that's OK if they would be able to advise us. I just don't want to end up calling, paying and then they say "lol, no idea what you're talking about, sry". e payment gateways use VISA/Mastercard and they're out of the question (not smart when they decide to shut down Bitcoin).Thanks.
This is an absolutely terrible way for Bitcoin to break out. I was at least hoping firstly we were going to see articles about the positives of Bitcoin before we started seeing about the illegal stuff. Everything we've been working on for months has been to protect Bitcoin from attack.

Hey,Just wanted to say that the above was very helpful for getting me to visualise a user on the site. Thank you. For people who enter their details wrong: don't do it. It causes me a massive headache when balancing the sheets. In any case, usually the bank pretends they processed the payment then my sister gets a letter in the mail 1 week later saying it was rejected and the funds re-appear in my bank account. I then have to manually trawl backwards through email/records to see whose it was and add the funds back to their account. So it will take a while.Also, can people stop spamming my email with silly questions? It's common that I get emails from people along the lines of "I just deposited GBP. Where are my Bitcoins?". Silly email = swamp my inbox = important mails from people with real issues get missed. Hey,When explaining to people about bitcoin, do yourself a favour by talking about bitcoins being introduced through the process of verifying transactions. The verifiers gain a reward for securing the network against attack.People understand faster than when I use the ill fated gold mining analogy. Verifying more accurately conveys the nature of confirmations. Mining has the negative connotation of being a way for people to get free (gratis) money. Here are the majority of reasons why people's deposits don't go through and I have to do them manually:- You misspell your deposit code.- Your bank fubars the reference field adding junk or dropping it entirely.- You try a deposit on the weekend when banks are closed.For withdrawals it happens that often people forget or mistype their sort code. Even then, withdrawals take a few days.Anyway I run the service so people can get GBP in the UK and it's tireless work. If you want, then the source code is open for you to setup your own exchange. Sometimes it's hard to respond because I get upwards of 20+ emails a day. Haha, this is awesome.I also like your other site: http://exchange.surething.biz/The crypto-currency of the junkies. Well we have a new version of the site at https://gitorious.org/intersango/intersango/commits/experbut it's experimental and awaiting testing before the changes are rolled out for real.http://bitcoinconsultancy.com/wiki/index.php/Intersango Don't forget that banks don't process payments at weekends  Hey,Help me out by buying a bus ticket for me on eurolines.nl (they accept VISA) and I'll send BC with a small bonus.Tickets are 138 EUR or $196. From MtGox last price that's 196/6.36 = 30.82 BC.I'll give 31.25 BC.First come first served.  bitcoinwatch.com has an api Yeah google changes the OpenID string depending on which method you use to login (say youtube vs gmail) eventhough they're linked. That's why I recommend MyOpenID.
@Jaromil - I think there was a misunderstanding. Sirius has taken me off bitcoin.org because I am not considered a core developer. I think there are simply so many things happening now and since our projects are more long term, it is easy for people not to see the extent at which I am involved. I will send him a message and clear it up.no worries "I wanna be a bitcoin billionaire sooo freaking bad" < haha, hilarious Kak dela? Not giving an exact figure here but the amount of funds on Britcoin are usually 100x the volume of the market.But it varies: there was a point where we were getting 3k volume per day and had 10k GBP, 10k BTC.Usual MtGox volume is 20k, so I'd say they likely have ~200k online. Not sure if you know: https://britcoin.co.uk/   I've been inundated with impatient people while I was upgrading the site. Sorry payments took a bit longer than usual - if you check our site we say 3-5 working days and this time it took 3 days rather than 1. You sound like you're 14 PM'ed you. If you are a US company, operating a US exchange then there is an incredible amount of laws that you must abide by that makes it near impossible due to the huge initial expense. HAHAHA so true. Yeah, perhaps I did get a little bit excited. It won't scale currently,http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7450.0 Do:use intersango;delete from baskets;INSERT INTO baskets (code, fullname, sibl) VALUES ('NC', 'Namecoin', 'N');INSERT INTO baskets (code, fullname, sibl) VALUES ('N', 'Magical N, 'NC');Put the required images under  www/images/flags  (N_flag.png NC_flag.png) You people forget that the public key is visible. Therefore you cannot invalidate the card because you can look up the bitcoin address on blockexplorer.com to see if it has the funds in that the card claims.Once someone decides to crack open the card, they'll be the first to spend them.BitBills should include some kind of serial code / id number which can be used to verify it on their website. That way you can verify that the card actually came from them. Maybe they could sell POS scanners that verify the tokens when swiped. Instead of having the reward half every 210k blocks,I wouldn't have it drop by 1/4 every 105k blocks.Nor would I have it drop by 1/8 every 52k blocks.Nor drop by 1/16 every 26k blocks.But drop by 1/32 every 13k blocks.Seems much easier/closer to the current scheme than an approximated exponential.

I'm not sure exactly how these mining pools work. If Deepbit is using closed software which gives them an edge, I hope that their members have access to the code of that software... otherwise it is very damaging the the confidence of the entire BTC world and this will no doubt negatively effect the bottom line of the Deepbit miners.Perhaps I'm a non-technical noob, but please let me know why this disparity exists. Hey,I missed your post, but if you scroll down to process() you'll see I lock the database first.
Europeans wishing to deposit on this site may use the external service TransferWise. apt-get Hey,I've been looking at OpenTransactions for a while and I'm still not getting why you would want to use it over a simple number in your database.As I can figure, whenever you transfer a token, you have to register that with the central server to prevent a double spend.If so then what's the purpose?Thanks So to modify the currencies in master is contrived and involves editing the source.In exper it involves adding the correct row under the table:mysql> select * from baskets;+-----+------+---------------+------+| cid | code | fullname      | sibl |+-----+------+---------------+------+|   9 | BTC  | Bitcoin       | GBP  ||  10 | GBP  | British Pound | BTC  |+-----+------+---------------+------+2 rows in set (0.02 sec)And add the appropriate flag image under www/images/flags/ As you can see, 3 of us have been working on this software round the clock.https://gitorious.org/intersangoATM we're working on a new branch that's nearly complete (see exper). All features have been added accept for dark pools which should be completed today or tomorrow. Then next week we'll be testing, merging to master and re-testing again.If you go to #bitcoinconsultancy on IRC , that's a good place to ask questions since the other devs are there too.You can PM metonymous,http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=10462I know he's been setting up his own AU exchange using our current master (stable) branch. How about banks though that are all running decades old software from the 80s? I'm skeptical of this happening. Right now it's easy to upgrade while the community is small and people download their client from one source.But once everybody is running different flavours of Bitcoin, network-wide upgrades are not a solution.Take a look at ipv4 and ipv6 today. The internet runs slower, less secure and is running out of addresses but nobody upgrades. Eventhough there's been many years to enable ipv6 and the running out of ipv4 addresses was well predicted in advance. Shame you don't ship to Europe. I always wanted chain mail as a child. Your chain mail t shirt is super cool Wouldn't this fork the chain? And don't you need the mutual agreement from loads of differing clients that might not upgrade simultaneously? Hey,I met a web designer guy who last night made a point about the number of transactions being limited because of the block size. I did some calculations. Can somebody confirm these numbers for me?MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 1000000 bytesAverage transaction = ~200 bytes (conservative lower limit)Average number of tx per block = 1000000/200 = 5000Each block has an interval of ~10 minsthat means 5000 confirmed tx / 10 mins OR 500 tx / min OR8 tx / s---------------Visa must do thousands of tx a second or maybe more. We're still organising our group and I just heard that it's more unlikely than likely we'll make Zurich... But hopefully I can make it still. "Every day the site will be down between 01:00-05:00 (AM) GMT as we analyse the site for potential issues. We are carefully monitoring our system."Although I don't take the site down everyday as said, I generally do take it down in the early mornings weekly for checking out problems. This time my analysis tools detected some anomalies which turned out a minor bug (hence I shut it down until a fix was rolled out). your url is messed up in the op,http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7018 Maybe me and my friend come to Zurich to meet you guys. If so do you have a contact number? Cool. Any more info? I can get my finance friend to read through all of this. Amazing idea! Love it.

Yeah I read all that but am unsure which method MtGox uses, and what parameters they use. Hey,I want to add dark pools to Britcoin. How do the dark pools on MtGox work? They also have 'dark pool with normal' - what's that?

Well your query does a cartesian join then filters out some rows using a WHERE and is less efficient than JOIN ...

I know I could do SELECT 1 FROM uk_requests WHERE reqid='133'; to see whether it exists in uk_requests, but how about for all 3 in one go?Is an extra field in requests the way to go?

Cool. Let me know if you pass by Amsterdam and I might spare you a sofa (depends if we're there). Probably the US.Which city is the best for Bitcoin users? Geographically in a convenient place. I think my patch is better, http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5938.0   Old thread: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5938.0So it was decided to split the pull request into several smaller ones. Here's the new one: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/169The full implementation works like:genjix@foo.org will do a lookup on http://foo.org/getaddress/?nickname=genjixThat will return either a JSON containing error/errcode (which will throw) or a json containing the address.For setting the address you sign it using an RSA keypair + timestamp (if the timestamp is too old then the server should reject the request). The updating the name will return a JSON containing status or either error/errcode.To add the public key for your RSA keypair or add new nicknames you login using your OpenID on the site. As an example: http://109.75.176.109bitcoind publickeywill show your public key.To see the full implementation see my branch on github:https://github.com/genjix/bitcoin/tree/bitnomThe relevant files are access.h resolv.h rpc.cpp (rpc_send, updatename, publickey).The PHP example implementation for the server is in contrib/ns/ New thread: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5938.0 Suck me off.  tcatm had a fix for this a few months back. How come it hasn't been integrated in? There is a bunch of cycles for ensure validity before withdrawals are verified. Then I have to actually authorise this myself. OK, thanks.

After much consideration and chatting with topi`, I decided on the maxim that there's a trade-off between user inconvenience and anonymity at some point.Educated users should be using Bitcoin addresses for large amounts and this naming protocol as a convenience method for small amounts.

Yes. I also support renaming the current client to wxBitcoin to avoid confusion... From my friend Jaromil. I love this little speech: Sure  It's by bank deposit. I modified JSON-RPC -> jgarzik incorporated code from that -> you've added backwards compatibility.Stop recommending Dinosaurs when we're at Mammals. It's evolution.It's even backwards compatible with JSON-RPC if you're a strange person. Why do we even recommend JSON-RPC at all?It's not even an official library for Python and it isn't very good (uses floats and has no persistent connections). We should only be recommending jgarzik's version. I'm not prepared to fuck around with other people's money because of my own beliefs about how the world should be run. My own money: yes, but not others.We accept bank deposits for the time being. Payment processors will be coming sometime. lots of people asking for jobs and nobody is interested in this?   We have $2k for development on Intersango, the exchange behind Britcoin. And potentially more.This next 2 months, all that money and any more is assigned completely to bounties for developing the site.We also have 800 BTC that we will be matching other bounties for Bitcoin development. The money we've received is for the exchange, but this is our contribution back to the community. We are looking into getting more funds hopefully for developers.http://bitcoin.cz.ccAnybody interested can join in our meeting on Skype tomorrow. We will run a shared screen session over SSH + skype voice chat + webcam feed. My Skype name is zgenjix. At this conference the majority approved. Mainly because it wasn't entirely banker types.Afterwards the organiser told us that we had the best talk of the entire conference. He said there _were_ a few banker types sitting there all white-faced & scared looking around nervously. The video has been cut to look professional but halfway through people spontaneously applauded and people were laughing at various points to things. There was this hum of mumble every so often and people looking at each other.I think you're all underestimating how excited these people were. Maybe they don't yet see it as battle tested & too risky but they certainly all loved the idea, the concept.  btw here's the talk for everyone else,http://vimeo.com/22072121 Everybody afterwards told me I was amazing, and we had multiple people asking to eat with us at lunch that we couldn't meet all. You can't see in the talk but people were laughing at all the cool shit like drugs .etc and when taking my seat people were patting my back/giving me a thumbs up.Inexperience- no way. I've spoken at bigger/more famous conferences before. You should maybe google my nickname/real name.Intimidated - no way. Showing a picture of black bloc anarchists, drugs, crushing the system, wikileaks and a gun. Wearing nail polish. I felt perfectly fine.And the slides was their fault since they didn't tell me I would not have my laptop on stage and that I have to use their Mac. I released the source code for Britcoin for this reason. Currently we're talking with lawyers to gain the relevant licenses and expand to other currencies hopefully.If anyone wants to setup their own exchange, then I can do this for a small fee of ~400 BTC. Yeah, funny to see how positively anons react the Bitcoins, when supposedly 'intelligent' Slashdot is overly critical. http://boards.4chan.org/b/res/320214606Post about Silk Road https://britcoin.co.uk/api/getDepth.phphttps://britcoin.co.uk/api/getTrades.phphttps://britcoin.co.uk/api/ticker.phpSame as MtGox API.

I don't charge any fees for the time being. taken down now, but visit google cache while it's still up:here It means that when you pay into the system, firstly new payments go into one database and appear under your profile as 'verifying'.Then some tools are run, and after 24 hours they get credited to your account.This is mainly because I check everyday for errors, bugs or security problems. So it gives me time to inspect what's happening before anything occurs.
Ubuntu. Even if there's a patch for this problem, it's good to have a backup for if Bitcoin does crash. interesa video pri libereco:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2fiuysKQ4 This idea needs reviving. Today bitcoind locked up on my server and wasn't responding to errors.Apart from saying 'bitcoin shouldn't crash', what kind of backup systems could exist to gracefully recover when Bitcoin locks up?Not sure what can be done except calling an safety check hook which kills/restarts bitcoind. Ideally it'd be nice to run multiple nodes and switch between them freely (sharing the same wallets or having 'backup' nodes with a BTC store). Yep, I meant along the lines of: increment class counter, store it as private ID. The class on the wiki already supports automatic introspection and uses python's Decimal class:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29#PythonCode:import urllibimport decimalimport json class JSONRPCException(Exception):    def __init__(self, rpcError):        Exception.__init__(self)        self.error = rpcError class ServiceProxy(object):    def __init__(self, serviceURL, serviceName=None):        self.__serviceURL = serviceURL        self.__serviceName = serviceName     def __getattr__(self, name):        if self.__serviceName != None:            name = "%s.%s" % (self.__serviceName, name)        return ServiceProxy(self.__serviceURL, name)     def __call__(self, *args):         postdata = json.dumps({"method": self.__serviceName, 'params': args, 'id':'jsonrpc'})         respdata = urllib.urlopen(self.__serviceURL, postdata).read()         resp = json.loads(respdata, parse_float=decimal.Decimal)         if resp['error'] != None:             raise JSONRPCException(resp['error'])         else:             return resp['result']How does this improve on that? I saw that you're using httplib instead of urllib. Any reasons for that?Also you may wish to read,http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/Python libraries generally follow that style as to provide a consistent API. It doesn't always happen but everybody tries to use that same standard Using the ID count is clever. Would it maybe be a good idea to either make that a class variable? For when people instantiate multiple Proxies across threads or something. Source code for Britcoin is free. You can either try to set it up yourself, or I will do it for 600 BTC. Or 2 people at the same time for 800 BTC. Fool. I PM'ed you to ask if you want to help out. You replied then did nothing.Your loss.Don't know about Kiba but I suspect the same.Are you both 12? I guess you're only good for making crappy forum posts attacking people rather than taking the initiative to write useful code. Not here to be your parent. In the future if you want to work on the net, you have to be pro-active and self-directed. Excited to see where this goes! Where did you get this machine to mod? Hey guys,Just thought you'd want to keep up on my daily adventures about me me me.So, I might shave my head completely...Honestly, do I pull it off well it enough to keep it like this in the long-term?Look at me... please.

But you can see the futuristic abstract direction we're going with: Bleh. Will it be fixed then if I do a re-clone and use that one? Instead of removing all of this:https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=PHP_developer_intro&action=historysubmit&diff=6404&oldid=5737Maybe we should add it to the bottom of the page, with an opening paragraph about how it isn't strictly necessary, but can help avoid problems. Because I did take time to write that for people, and doubtless others will find it useful, but not everyone may wish to use it  I guess so.If you can place a test.html in / and it works then that's probably your problem. ... And we're on BitcoinCharts, http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/britcoinGBP.html What files did you get in the install?I have:Code:NameVirtualHost *:80NameVirtualHost *:443Listen 80Listen 443Code:<VirtualHost *:443>     SSLEngine On     SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/britcoin.co.uk.crt     SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/britcoin.co.uk.key     SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/apache2/ssl/gd_bundle.crt     ServerAdmin webmaster@britcoin.co.uk     ServerName britcoin.co.uk     DocumentRoot /www     ErrorLog /apache2/error.log     CustomLog /apache2/access.log combined</VirtualHost>Maybe that helps. Except Python's JSON-RPC has no support for that. You have to use my (non-standard) modified version:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29#PythonI prefer wherever possible that people stick with official libraries.Bitcoin now is effectively saying that all other languages are broken therefore we won't fix our API.Oh but there's a hack you can use to workaround... It's mostly accurate to the 8th decimal place.Not the point!By exposing an API which nearly all languages interpret as floats, you are expressing a statement of intent that it's fine to use floats for clients (API users). It should be passed as strings (without the decimal point preferably) that users have to explicitly cast to mutable objects. Then they realise that since these values are in INT51 strings (since we can't use large ints in JSON), they'll hopefully understand to deal with the values using ints.You're encouraging users to deal with floats ATM. Bad practice, and shouldn't be encouraged.I am really paranoid about leakage, and for me to even touch a float when dealing with people's money is unacceptable. On Britcoin, there's a whole system of balances and checks at every stage of the various transactions to ensure consistency to all decimal places, and I would not want to throw a spanner in the works because of a tiny rounding error (which would throw up flags and warnings everywhere). Even hearing the words round(...) is like heresy. Why not make the wiki the front page?I could even put that weusecoins as a huge banner on there. On my local machine I push some commits:Code:* 26810c9 (HEAD, origin/master, master) force fixed precision in exchange rates SQL.* 2cc7743 fixed conversion function to stop float rounding errors.* f61ca2e changed exchange rate wording to reflect new alg.* 08ec5ac fixed decimal places for exchanger.I login to the remote machine and pull:Code:*   d095816 (HEAD, master) Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/m|\  | * 26810c9 (origin/master, origin/HEAD) force fixed precision in exchange rates SQL* |   85590e6 Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/master|\ \  | |/  | * 2cc7743 fixed conversion function to stop float rounding errors.* |   f354456 Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/master|\ \  | |/  | * f61ca2e changed exchange rate wording to reflect new alg.* |   37af61e Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/master|\ \  | |/  | * 08ec5ac fixed decimal places for exchanger.| * ebc9a87 per nanotube's suggestion: switch buy to show sell rates & vice versa.* |   607d762 Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/master|\ \  Ugly!

I don't see why it's needed to do merges when I have no changes locally.
Check your facts first before spreading falsehoods.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29#Ruby I did not put any BTC into Britcoin at all and people are trading sucessfully. Kensington at 20:30* Genjix* Lumos* LyspoonerWe're meeting up because they want to put down deposits on Britcoin.co.uk, but we will turn this into a general meetup if anybody wants to come along. Be good to swap notes & share projects.Cya Enjoy your Coca-Cola laced with Cyanide + Anthrax Yep, I get why it's a tree. But I'm wondering if there's a way to prettify it into a list like on my local machine. Like the local machine (2nd one). I'm not making any changes there. >put in a couple grand for a siteThat part.However are you based in the US? Because I must warn you that you will have a major competitor in that market in addition to MtGox. You're not being very realistic and depending on your expertise/requirements I could set you up for far less. Although it would be an operation you'd have to be actively involved in. OK, as per a few people's suggestions, it now uses the best rate. My workflow working on my Bitcoin site is:* Fetch encrypted database from server to localhost, unencrypt and load.* Add new features to local machine & test.* Push changes to gitorious (git push).* Login to remote server and pull changes (git pull).But my graph looks screwy:Code:*   d095816 (HEAD, master) Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/m|\  | * 26810c9 (origin/master, origin/HEAD) force fixed precision in exchange rates SQL* |   85590e6 Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/master|\ \  | |/  | * 2cc7743 fixed conversion function to stop float rounding errors.* |   f354456 Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/master|\ \  | |/  | * f61ca2e changed exchange rate wording to reflect new alg.* |   37af61e Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/master|\ \  | |/  | * 08ec5ac fixed decimal places for exchanger.| * ebc9a87 per nanotube's suggestion: switch buy to show sell rates & vice versa.* |   607d762 Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/master|\ \  | |/  | * 59080d5 per nanotube's suggestion, use best rate for calc rate.| * 3996ad3 best rates go at the top.| * 4a29854 reformatted exchange rate SQL.* |   793fdf5 Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/master|\ \  | |/  | * fdd322a Ability to cancel requests as well as stricter viewing permissions.| * e140119 protect viewing orders from outside intruders.| * 69d49b0 cast to string before comparison.| * dbcb489 fixed typo preventing orders showing up* |   083d928 Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/master|\ \  | |/  | * 3770477 fix broken require path.| * 7de5a0b moved into bank subdir. off by default to protected against user error.* |   6341d52 Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/master|\ \  | |/  | * 09e2947 withdrawal script to GBP bank.* |   341c06d Merge branch 'master' of git://gitorious.org/intersango/master|\ \  | |/  How can I fix that?

My Bitcoin branch doesn't use GMP. It's simply a change to AmountFromValue, ValueFromAmount and other functions that weren't using those helper methods. They're referring to me using GMP in PHP which I use for a range of reasons. Namely PHP not always having 64 bit ints:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/864058/how-to-have-64-bit-integer-on-php I thought long and hard about this and in the end decided against it.If I'm running an exchange and I have jon, bill and dave all handling various currencies then I must trust them not to make an exchange/be a scammer. In the end I decided going with the many various exchanges is the best plan. If you manage to gather lots of IVs then you can use ones that are the same/similar to do a statistical attack to discover the secret key. This is how WEP is cracked because it's IV is only 24 bit, and that's not long enough to ensure that the same key isn't used twice. There's also another flaw whereby you can inject special packets to make the AP spew IVs but that's another story :p I wrote https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/PHP_developer_intro  I own Britcoin and our source code is open. If you contact me then I can get you setup for a small fee as I'm doing with CCCMikey. The more people we have using this same software, the easier I can turn it into a safe, secure, easy to install piece of kit for setting up a Bitcoin exchange.Then we'll have lots of exchanges. I love that quote. YESPay him all the cash already you stingy cunts! Do you know how much effort has gone into that quality video?He's gone beyond what was expected IMO. Too many people offering bounties on these forums and then not paying up after/changing their terms. Pay him all the cash already you stingy cunts!

"First person to get triples gains 200 BTC" (chance of triples = 1/1000 or 0.2 btc per person).But I couldn't think of a way to stop the same person spamming all the posts. This way by posting images, there's a small amount of work involved.Would be cool to offer mass-phonecalls/DoS for bitcoins. Then you go on 4chan and offer money per recorded prank. i.e be a pimp. Agreed. I'm just have trouble thinking how I could pay and get semi-useful things in return.Anyone wants to consider donating, 19K9PAANER8Qy2w8KeMop2YagbHPK5cU17All of the donations I receive then I'll add 1/4 and do another 4chan rally. http://boards.4chan.org/b/res/319116201donated ~25 BTC to various people. Agreed with stack overflow format. Web forums suck. Haha, know the feeling.Seems everybody is trying to bluff the other side to meet their prices ATM. Starting to see buyers/sellers converge towards each other.Tomorrow I have unexpected business come up that I have to attend to. So payments may not show up in accounts until later in the day/at night. If you want to set one up then contact me and we can sort something out. FYI I run Britcoin. Just want to chime in and say that me and CCCMikey are discussing opening an AU exchange where I'll maintain/run/design his site using the software at Britcoin. I originally wrote this software so that there could be many Bitcoin exchanges, and we can develop a solid piece of exchange site code for Bitcoin. Hence why I'm running Britcoin for free, at a loss.We are doing method 1. There's a company so far that has given me various resources, and they plan to take over in a month after gaining the required licenses and legitimisation. Then they'll be able to integrate other payment services, the site will start charging and I'll relinquish control. One of our stipulations was that the site's sourcecode is released for free (and so I'm not receiving any payment from them).Anyway, converging all of our resources to build a secure, customisable, easy to setup exchange site should be a priority. I want to get it so any Joe Sixpack can open a new exchange site in an afternoon eventually and allow people to trade Bitcoins. This is our strongest weapon- diversification. Source code for Britcoin: http://gitorious.org/intersango/master/trees/master http://boards.4chan.org/b/res/318924551#318925999for you propaganda activists Can you give sgnornick permission to update the front page with 4 news items every 2 days? He's been fairly consistently generating a history. Right. Check under your profile.I'm carefully monitoring the site ATM. Everything requires my permission before the scripts can deposit into your account. This is because I'm checking + double checking in case there's errors.Your payment should be authorised soon.EDIT: Did you refresh the page yet? It should show up under your profile as an not yet authorised request.EDIT2: OK, it's actually my fault. Refresh your profile now. These are my previous sites:http://genjix.freehostia.com/http://britcoin.co.uk/Tell me what you mean by 'really cool'. Does my style fit that category? Because it usually takes a lot of work to design a professional looking site.Probably for a Bitcoin website we'd make pixel art + some mascots. Site already exists: http://bitcoin.cz.cc/ Very nice.

Therefore I'm personally authorising all payments and transactions until I'm confident to switch on automation.http://britcoin.co.uk/You can find our sourcecode on Gitorious. We are now open http://britcoin.co.uk/ I don't understand this.He did everything you asked for in the OP.Him not compiling his changes (which is the easiest part) suddenly invalidates his bounty? Reminds me of a friend whose landlord refused to pay him his deposit on leaving because my friend hadn't hovered the floor.You were asking for a task which takes a programmer 15 mins of his time + 10 years of experience. He did that and crunched the numbers for you. Then you came out with an excuse not to pay up. There's actually no easy way to do this. You can call a program called gpgsm using:If you insist, then you should look at the gpgsm sourcecode as it's a specially built tool for the job.The last 2 lines can be done in C++ easily. To load RSA keys you can do:If it's a public key then use PEM_read_bio_PKCS7 instead. The above function should recognise it's PKCS.Maybe sometimes you'll need an EVP object:1HmskBCwhnV8DRvYdpBmDyyTwGc28otPeZ Not everyone thinks the government here is evil. I genuinely believe there's many individuals who believe they can do/are doing good for people. However the entire system has evolved into a corrupted organism. It's not an evil conspiracy but a 'stand alone complex'.Many of these government institutions once instituted can never disappear. A cancerous growth that drains it's host. War budgets will only ever get larger.People are socially evolving and changing as a species. New attitudes are taking the place of old attitudes. Economies are shifting to non zero-sum game, service oriented. We may see the first people on Mars this century. In a creative economy, one sees neighbours as team mates rather than competitors because the sum of intelligence of the whole > the few. Because a country has more to gain by pooling intelligence with others than by warring it's inhabitants.Whether one likes it or not. The leaderless future is inevitable. Extrapolate the ongoing trend and it's clear where everything is headed. Technology has helped massively. pi is wrong.http://tauday.comde moivre is meaningless with the incorrect constant. My soon to be opened exchange has free source code.http://gitorious.org/intersango/master/trees/masterFederation won't happen because I don't trust your exchange. Yeah, OK. Maybe I'm a bit harsh. These things don't interest me too much usually. Kind of make me want to barf (like romantic movies). blaa blaa the video sucks. Cue dramatic music & people waffling on without making sense.I can make a video of the most boring topic and overlay this sad music and it'd have the same effect.Not insightful or interesting. Typical responses "Being alive makez me happy! Like being here. Like enjoying miself.". derp. jesus, some of those people sound like cartoon characters.

How would that work in practice? 1 year before items expire?I'd prefer all proposals have the same expiry date (if they do) because considering all the different expiry dates for someone who takes on that proposal is confusing. edit the wiki, write articles.spread it on other forums.come up with new ideas for websites.help noobs out You owe theymos 20 BTC. You have a picture of every single person I hate. Well done.Also, Balance = trollface > been searching ages he says> Front page -> Help -> Getting startedhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Getting_started I am a profit. Some of you on here are rand zealots. Just because you think one way, doesn't mean everybody thinks the same. If you could find one motivator for human actions then you would win a nobel prize and be hailed the world over as famous.It's like some of you are consigned to being selfish bastards so to ease that cognitive dissonance you assume everybody is the same and make these contrived arguments about how it's done to "make yourself feel good" or some other bullshit reason.- Why do people vote? It's -EV- Why do people make anonymous posts on 4chan? I sometimes make posts there, then instantly leave the thread.- Or help people out on IRC? Doesn't feel good at all, but I recognise that people help me out a lot and I have an obligation to do the same. Even when I join new channels + with unknown users I've never been to before.Not everyone is blind profit maximisers. Even the evolutionary science says that humans are altruists to some degree as a result of group level selection (altruist groups are more likely to survive in the wild and therefore are selected for).A better theory for human behaviour (incidentally that is accepted by mainstream psychology) is to say that each person has a self image. All actions we take are to try and stay congruent with this self image to minimise cognitive dissonance. If you're a cutthroat salesman ripping off customers with junk, then you're going to reason that you're doing nothing wrong in this competitive world. If you're religious, you might reason that all non-religious people are deliberately denying God/trying to ignore him. If you're atheist, you reason that religious people are in self-denial. If you're an artist, you may reason that everything is about feeling. A scientist reasons that it's about hard facts & evidence.Here's an email snippet for your amusement, showing at least one example (me) that not everyone is profit oriented and can in fact have other goals in life (horror!)

I agree. Either variable length or INT128.The beginning 13 bits are not even used and are always 0 even. Maybe they could be used as a flag to indicate another INT64 following the same format on the end. Rapelay is jaw dropping & looks cool. I'll integrate Disqus.

I've looked over a fair chunk of the code trying to understand it (not all of it) and can assure you that it does exactly what it says.And I doubt it was written by a programmer BTW. My thoughts is an academic of some sorts. satoshi is maybe a mathematician. Yes, because people develop more and more efficient ways for mining. One guy here even prefabs custom chips.Also the cost for minting new bitcoins is faaar lower than creating new metal coins/paper money + transporting them + counting them + handling them.

This is actually a very cool idea.By using existing systems, it allows you get up to speed very quickly.Yet at the same time you loose the flexibility and inventiveness from having a blank canvas.

You could check the help pages https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/PHP_developer_intro I predicted this recent decrease in early Feb, http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3396.0And people were all saying I am wrong.Right now it's going to continue decreasing before we see the next expansionary stage within 3 months as a) new exposure occurs b) services open. I doubt it's going to drop to 0.6.We're starting to see a few (not many) useful purposes for Bitcoin. 2 days ago I saw Bitcoin being discussed on 4can (as a way to buy drugs using silk road + tor). Expect more of this. Especially with Nefario's stock market and client improvements/forks. what's a windows?yes i run linux. Did you read that link I typed up? what is f^inf (0) where f(x) = x^x ? 1) It wants me to register to view their page.2) Their community is on facebook.So much for openness. I give them 3/10. Otherwise the idea sounds good & interests me, but I need to see some documents first. And it needs to be out there for all, not weaseled behind walls.TBH this is too much of a struggle. Having built my latest site around OpenID, the standard is broken. All the providers do sketchy things that break it, and it's needlessly complex as a result of bickering board members. Things like the email field is optional meaning you need a register field anyway. The format for the URL is also unusual.The difference is that companies WANT OpenID. Banks do not. Not in their interest. Many of their systems are relics from a bygone age.Good luck to them though. Like the idea. You can recognise Esperanto. That is very cool. I will give you 3 BTC.Some of us here speak Esperanto including me and grondilu. I was saying to grondilu that I was not happy with his negative attitude. Is this a good setup to run 2+ bitcoin instances?Each one is running under a separate user, so no need to set -datadir.bitcoind -rpcport=8721 # this will be the master running as rootbitcoind -rpcport=8121 -connect=127.0.0.1 -nolisten  # slave 1bitcoind -rpcport=8216 -connect=127.0.0.1 -nolisten  # slave 2The above is for 2 users. They connect through the master node.Am I missing anything? I'm the creator this site, http://britcoin.co.uk/findex.php?page= , http://pastecoin.com/ and http://bitcoin.cz.cc/It's really easy to get setup. Send me a message through this forums and I'll help you out.Then you can decide to pay me whatever you think I deserve EDIT: I wrote this up, https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/LAMP_developer_intro ... Hope that helps. Yes.You run bitcoin using -datadir /path/to/usb/Once encryption is added to wallets, then you'll be able to keep your RSA key on your computer, and your wallet on the USB stick. ATM still working on that. If I want to submit an article, what formatting options do I have?Is it just plain html? I'm cool with that. bold/italic, 2 header sizes and 'display: block' images.Good site. Perfect and simple. August??? Are you joking? That's like 6 months away. Not even sure if I'll still be in UK then or what. Don't worry. Those problems are already fixed. It's actually using a utility library from another project,http://gitorious.org/intersango/master/trees/masterWhen I upload it, I'll migrate the new library over.(The problem FYI was that in util.php cleanup_string applies a regex. Originally it was using ereg_replace but that's deprecated. The newer preg_replace requires / / on both sides of the search string.)I'll keep you posted once everything's done so you can check   For now, I'm still waiting on the VPS from mtux.http://gitorious.org/postecon No I remember him explicitly stating that it was because he could make breaking changes to the protocol at any time. Now there's no risk of that. We need forks and other clients. Have one client named 'Bitcoin' is a killer for any other implementations. That was because he planned further changes to the client. But he's left now. VPS is paid for  Just waiting for MagicalTux to give me the details since a few days (well he HAS suffered an earthquake).
Secondly, can sgornick's news items be put on the front-page? I'd like to see him become maintainer of a front-page news feed.http://www.bitcoinnews.com/It shows to new people that this project is active, and things are happening. Especially for new services to get limelight.Maybe also show the exchange rate. It's a common question for new users to ask how much a bitcoin is, and where they can get some.http://bitcoinwatch.com/ Can we also get away from having 'the one true' version of bitcoin listed?Ideally we want multiple clients. There should be a list of different clients like "here's some ways of connecting to bitcoin:"... For now it'd only be 'Bitcoin' and 'BitCoinJ'. But in the future would be Python clients, various forks and builds for different platforms.Could the mainline Bitcoin also be renamed? It's confusing to refer to the currency, protocol and 1 implementation by one name. I suggest Bytecoin to mix things up a bit.The whole idea would be a list of different implementations. No one version would be better.I realise this is bad for end-user convenience, but it's *much* more healthy for project development, because this way many versions get exposure instead of one version approved by the cabal to go up on the site. Diversify. I got over-excited seeing the title.How comes you made a wrapper for bitcoind? Seems a bit superfluous :p Thanks for sharing.btw, I improved ServiceProxy. You should use my version, https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_tutorial_%28JSON-RPC%29#Python Just a tip: if they consistently apply proper spacing and capitalisation, then their perceived language skills would sky-rocket. It's a small thing that takes 20 mins to learn.- Spaces after ALL punctuation.- No spaces before.- Initial capitals after .?!- No more than one space.- Don't mix ...,.,., and only ever use a single .- Don't use Chinese idioms in English.- Titles should follow the Wikipedia style guide: Initial capital with Names capitalised. (it's the easiest to remember and use IMO)- 1 idea per paragraph. Paragraphs should be around 3-6 sentences.Overall pretty cool experiment. Can't wait to see round 2. Kial vi agas kiel malbonulo?

The start was nice, it's always good hearing gavin's thoughts on the nature of money. Looks like Madhatter was right though.Clap, clap. Hey,I'm looking for data and graphs so I can compare Bitcoin to other networks/supercomputers to show to laymans in visual terms how much more powerful our computing power is. It's a good argument in favour of Bitcoin's network rock hardiness.Numbers comparing Bitcoin hashing rate to Protein@FOLDING and SETI are much welcome.jgarzik says: ~5800 petaflops whereas F@H = 10 pflops.

Derp. I'm a pro designer + cg artist. I'm not confusing anything. Get off yer high horse.I know plenty about design.We don't need tons of glamour. That just makes Bitcoin look like a scammy company with something to hide. Bitcoin is what it is.I say go for that plain and simple design IMO.We are trying to emphasise a few simple points when describing Bitcoin and why it's better. The design should reflect that. open source projects don't need snazzy websites that look cool. They need plain minimal sites without ads that are quick to the point.free software says: "we are so cool that we don't need to win you over like a business. Here's the facts. Make up your own mind" Impossible to quantify. I propose instead doing it by the number of Wikipedia articles in that language (Wikipedia stats page shows this). Why not go with this exact design?(Change the bitcoin icon to the new one though)It's much simple & nice. Hard to correct the colours though since I don't have the original svg Nice. But that blue is far too garish and attracting for negative space. I suggest you use rare hues for the background. Also tone down the detail on those squares.Could you mix it up with some green (green tinted with yellow) to make it a little more intriguing.  The blue/grey makes it look bland/corporate.Also for the 3 download buttons, let's replace it by one button (detected by the browser user-agent OS) right-adjusted like how google does with google-chrome. Underneath is a link "See other downloads".The Linux or Windows link should then expand the bar to show the 2 options as radio buttons (with the default selected) and then you can click 'Download'.Just some suggestions. I like it overall. If you like the idea then show it by spending your bitcoins on them. There has to be some bitcoins available for them to win. ATM it seems everyone's being really stingy.

Maybe? Firstly I want to setup a dev oriented version for Bitcoin project development (think bug tracker where bugs have bounties attached)... Then once that's hosted, lets make another one for anything else?Kind of just like lets see where this goes. I haven't got hosting yet FWIW. Still looking. I emailed the author of that tool and he responded:That link he sent me is very informative.http://blog.tridgell.net/?p=111 not at all. punks like to turn the flag upside down and hate the queen. it's like saying fuck you. some even wear the swastika for shock value, but they all hate nazis (punks are anti-rascist, pro-environment, anarchist, ...)that pic... nice work  didn't think i could be more of a hotty than i am I don't like filling my system with junk. Personal preference.Also: security risk.& no way to ever uninstall. By 'credits', do you mean adding many credit types?I need more info on this system you're proposing.
It's on my laptop because I don't have a permanent host yet. cron job.Optionally add the ability for bitcoin to call external scripts on trigger actions with the action name + params. I've opened the source code + artwork to our exchange under GPL3http://gitorious.org/intersango/master/trees/masterI'm also selling support contracts,http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4576.0Hopefully we can get some nice exchanges going. Build a trading site,http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4576.0 Just found this tool:http://code.google.com/p/partiwm/wiki/xprahttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/XpraGUI version of GNU screen. Can't wait to try it out.EDIT: xpra works *really* well. Impressed.Edit2: heh, couldn't find support for multiple attached users... Hey,I'm working with a US company to open a UK exchange. The plan is to later add more currencies after gaining the required licenses.http://britcoin.co.uk/findex.php  (site isn't public yet)Per our agreement, all of the source code + artwork is free under the GPL3http://gitorious.org/intersango/master/trees/masterTo secure the site properly, I need to get vested interests involved. Therefore I'm selling a 1 month contract for setting up an exchange of your choice using a single currency. Hopefully we can expand this into a solid piece of exchange software.You will need:- Business bank account to accept deposits.- Internet banking.- LAMP VPS- Ability to build Bitcoin from source (we run a modified version).Here's what you get:- Custom artwork.- Integration with your bank account using scripts to parse the downloaded statements.- Install + updates.- 1 currency supported (for now).Auction closes on Monday. I will only accept 1 contract for the time being. Another after 1 week if all goes well.Payment is up front, but the 1 month starts from when you have everything needed ready. Anyone if free to setup their own exchange independent of us, but you lose the Q&A testing that we do.Minimum bid: 400 BTC fuck no. I do not like to sudo make install *anything* and nor do I recommend anyone else to ever do so.better would be to install wxwidgets to a local directory. anyway if you're compiling bitcoin then probably you'll be content with the CLI version, use google translate Peer-peer trading site like mtgox. We act as the escrow. People deposit money onto their accounts and trade with other people. The service will be free for this month until we legitimise our operation.Money is transferred using bank deposits ATM.We can begin taking deposits, but money will not appear on accounts until Monday.BTW the website source is GPL3 (including artwork), http://gitorious.org/intersango/master/trees/master We haven't made a public announcement yet because we're still performing Q&A testing, but we plan to open on Monday.http://britcoin.co.uk/ We haven't made a public announcement yet because we're still performing Q&A testing, but we plan to open on Monday.http://britcoin.co.uk/ I see a lot of questions about how to build Bitcoin.Here's how you do it on Ubuntu for the non-GUI version:sudo aptitude install build-essential libboost-all-dev libdb4.7++-dev libssl-dev libglib2.0-devmake -f makefile.unix bitcoind./bitcoind(someone add this to the build instructions on github) Saved. That info will be handy in the future. FYI the OP will likely not respond to that but I guarantee you he would've seen it. I used to have bad acne  Pick one of my photos and go nuts- I don't care.http://www.flickr.com/photos/genjix/(All disappeared after 2 months of using excessive amounts of Quinoderm cream twice a day. Tip for others who have acne).NOTE: With Quinoderm, don't dabble it day in, day off. Go full on. Plaster it everyday. Your skin will burn like hell, but after < 1 month, I was completely clear and it's never come back (stopped using it now). Fuck it! Lets do it!! I have a get rich quick scheme.  Welcome. Nice to see Chinese.You will not get money for free. You will need to offer a service. A service in exchange for something.There are many people on this forum. These people are very good with computers. But these people are not like normal people. They do not spend much on 'silly' things like music or fun. They think very practical (only about work).You will need to find the things they like.We are good with computers. We can easily find things for cheap. Selling products is a bad idea:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4547.0Computer people are not believing in spiritual matters. They like science. Selling traditional medicine is a bad idea:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4544.0We like to travel and we like China. China is far away and good. This idea is OK:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4522.0It is bad because:- It has a bad title. The title does not show to me the topic. The topic is what he is selling.- He does not show what he sells.- The grammar and spelling are bad.Lots of people want to learn languages. Chinese is a difficult language. Chinese is the most spoken language. We want to learn Chinese for speaking. Chinese is useful.This is a very very good idea:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4544.0I like it very much. 9/10The idea about the girlfriend, that is a good idea.My ideas:- Girls chatting on QQ per hour with boys (or girls).- Create artwork for people.- Sing a song about someone. Or a topic that they choose.- Promote bitcoin in China.- Buy bitcoins and sell the bitcoins to Chinese people.- You ask on here for funny (haha) tasks. Then you do the tasks. Then people pay you bitcoins.- Do backflips while you are dressed as a giant BITCOIN.- Offer cooking advice. OR relationship advice (for your girlfriend). OR lifestyle advice.- Be a psychologist. Listen to people's problems....You ask for bitcoins without offering any service. Is this because you have no ideas? Or because you have no service.This is not hard. There are very many ideas. Very many possibilities. Be creative. We respect creative people.Good luck. Thank you! That's great.Obviously the site is very basic for now. I hacked it up as an experiment. If it grows then I'll add features later on. See what happens.Like imagine a bug tracker, but where people can donate to prioritise bugs.ATM the front page heuristic is to select the top 10 most funded open tickets so far and the 5 newest ones (mixed together).The kickstarter thing sounds nice, but not my goal here. I want to see free software projects gain funding. Money goes really far in free software and even the smallest amounts will lead to a huge quality increase for everyone. Yep, basically that. Not slave/master. Agreed with what you said.It's like if one person writes something, then another can immediately correct you and continue, rather than getting hassled with a slow back and forth messaging. And it's easier to talk in code than on IRC.I'm interested to see it working as a teaching tool also. In the summer I might have someone to try it out on.I've been reading this,http://codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats.htmlInteresting read. http://92.7.172.0/Don't have a VPS for that around that I can use right now. Can someone please host this.It's a site where you propose features for Bitcoin and donate. Once the feature is completed & confirmed, then it goes to the dev who wrote that feature.It's an experiment into how future free software development could work.

Loving SNES games, I often used to wish I grew up in the 80s- the golden age of computing and all cool retro things. Everything had poor security in the 80s and I would be able to exploit all the systems with impunity- tbh I did that in the 90s while security was still bad and was expelled because of that.Now though, there's so much cool shit happening. Now is the best time in history.I see a lot of writing about the tech, but I'm trying to get a handle on how you felt. What ideas you had at the time. Did you imagine a future like this with internet? What did you think would happen? How about Linux? Did you realise things would get big? Did you feel like a wizard in a new online world like the movie Hackers?I love the 80s because it was the time of the hacker.Our time seems to be moving into something new & different. Can't wait to see what I label it as ad-hoc in the future. Lots of colour. Everyone building & participating to create this new online world. Amazing.Fuck, I wish I lived in the far future when we're terraforming Mars! That honestly makes me a little sad Certainly you look at the motivations & attitudes over the decades and there's been a massive shift. From the industrial era focus on work, corporations, family ... to creativity, individualism, knowledge. It's hard for people to notice this when you're an ant on the ground, and people constantly deride how things are getting worse- they most definitely are not! you forgot buy drugs Agreed. Keep it simple. Keep it perfect.In fact I'm starting to think there should be a basic Bitcoin implementation as a reference, and end-user Bitcoin with all the magic (name lookup service, wallet encryption, gui). I'm thinking about possibly forking Bitcoin for that reason :p OK, I misunderstood the OP.Why not just change the wallet format. Instead of having a flat directory of accounts containing addresses, instead you have a tree of containers. Each container can hold either a) addresses and b) other containers.This way you could assign an address for a transaction like:getaccountaddress genjix.order26getbalance genjix  (balance from genjix genjix.order23 genjix.order26 ...)getbalance genjix.order26 Do you want me to setup a site which accepts payments for people? It's a very easy thing to setup & release code.i.eMerchant signs up with me.Their merchant site redirects the user to a link like ?merchant=mymerchant.You login to my site using OpenID and it gives you an address to send BTC to.Merchant can query me to get their balance or I push the balance to them or something.But is this really any better than just using accounts or using mybitcoin? I don't think so. Hey,I've tried google but it's not turning up much. I'm looking for algorithms to match up and fulfill an orderbook.A offers 20 GBP for 10 BTCB offers 5 BTC for 9 GBPC offers 2 BTC for 6 GBPLooking above we can see that to fulfill A's order, we can use B but not C's order:BTC per GBP for A = A_want / A_amount = 10 / 20 = 0.5BTC per GBP for B = B_amount / B_want = 5 / 9 = 0.56if B_amount / B_want >= A_want / A_amount(rephrased to avoid float rounding errors)if B_amount * A_amount >= B_want * A_wantthen order is OKSo using B's rate to fulfill A's order gives A more BTC for his GBP's worth:=> take B's order from A leaves:A offers 11 GBP for 5.5 BTC at the original rate of 0.5  (A got a better deal than he was asking for but the rate he has chosen remains fixed).Do the comparison for C we see that (2 * 11 = 22) < 6 * 5.5... Ergo C's order is invalid for A.HOWEVERThis isn't optimal at all. It has two problems:- The rate is fixed at what A has chosen.- Doesn't find the best all round solution to fulfill an order for everybody.I tried rephrasing it as a linear programming problem,A offers 20 GBP for 10 BTCB offers 5 BTC for 9 GBPx = X / GBPy = Y / BTCConstraints:x <= 20y <= 5y >= x * 10 / 20  (from A's order)or y >= 0.5 xx >= y * 9 / 5     (from B's order)or y >= 0.56 xI have to maximise x + y in the space between those 2 lines and the box from the first 2 constraints... However the problem becomes error prone fast- I can easily do bounds detection but am worried about bugs.Implementation MUST be perfect. Therefore I'm asking if anybody knows any pre-existing systems, algorithms or code I can read. This picture makes me mad. I hope this isn't a common sentiment in America. sorry it was a typo. supposed to say 5.01The point was that PHP is casting to floats in their JSON decoder and there's no option to use doubles or strings. How so? I don't see any difference.
Try this:Code:<?php$json = '{"e":5.01}';var_dump(json_decode($json));?>Output:Code:object(stdClass)#1 (1) { ["e"]=> float(5.01) }  upload it to youtube. it has an option to set the default image. E-o This week I should have an exchange running. I'm in talks now with a company trying to legalise everything.Probably we'll have a demo site for trading small amounts this month, and then once we gain the license, they want to setup a proper operation.You can preview it here,http://fishysnax.com/intersango/(not the final site & an older version)And source code is open too, http://gitorious.org/intersango/master/trees/master Nah, the OP has a timestamp on it. So you can always calculate it.And who cares whether it's +/- 3 years? I just want a general idea of the demographic. Yep but it's a problem with the json decoding in PHP/Perl/Python. The actual precision for the number in a JSON is accurate AFAIK. It's nothing to do with Esperanto (except there's a translation of it).It's just a random (Esperanto) name picked for another Bitcoin client,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpesmiloThe Spesmilo was supposed to be a world currency to go with the world language of Esperanto :p Thought that the name had similar connotations with Bitcoin.BTW, I somewhat agree with luke-jr now I think about it. There's only one bitcoin.org, and having only 1 official version is exclusionary to all other competing implementations. In the same way email.org wouldn't only be about one program called Email but have links to a bunch of different versions. I'm actually curious about this data. It'd be useful for people to know, so we can provide better services for each other.My prediction:A few 13-16 year olds, majority 20-25, large portion of ~30, and some 35-50 year olds.20-25~3035-5013-16 You're right. In that case, it seems that going with strings is the only option.Still it might be a good idea to have API versions (bitcoin.getinfo()["rpcversion"]) and take an optional -rpcversion command line argument. When you create a new API, then the old one is deprecated for at least one release cycle, allowing compatibility.When a new RPC version is created (lets call new version 1 and old version 0 for example) then:bitcoindThe RPC version (0) in this release is DEPRECATED! Re-run bitcoind -rpcversion=1 for the new version. RPC changes can be found at http://bitcoin.org/rpcapi.htmlbitcoind stopbitcoind -rpcversion=1bitcoind getinfo..."rpcversion": 1...The policy would be to deprecate only when the API becomes backwards incompatible. Otherwise it's silently upgraded and becomes the default. Code:<?php$json = '{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4.08,"e":5}';var_dump(json_decode($json));?>Output:Code:object(stdClass)#1 (5) { ["a"]=> int(1) ["b"]=> int(2) ["c"]=> int(3) ["d"]=> float(4.08) ["e"]=> int(5) } Why don't why put in a new number likenAPIVersion and call the current API 0.Then we can make nAPIVersion 0.5 supporting the int64 with appended .0 as luke-jr has done in his gitorious branch.Then I want to make an API version 1.0 which puts in a strict naming convention for the methods (getblaa, action instead of the current messy names) and use namespaces. centrally planned = facebookfederated/decentralised = email The HTTP error codes are encoded into the JSON. But there are other errors like wrong username/password combination or status updates like new address added. You can't use HTTP header codes for those. - Anyone that prefers a saner API (because they're using PHP) should check out my branch,https://github.com/genjix/bitcoin/tree/strrpcValues are returned as int64 strings.Code:function numstr_to_internal($numstr){    return bcmul($numstr, pow(10, 8), 0);}function internal_to_numstr($num, $precision=8){    $repr = gmp_strval($num);    $repr = bcdiv($repr, pow(10, 8), $precision);    # now tidy output...    # trim trailing 0s    $repr = rtrim($repr, '0');    # and a trailing . if it exists    $repr = rtrim($repr, '.');    return $repr;}Those are the 2 functions I use to convert from internal values to display/user input values (numstr).I updated the wiki, https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_tutorial_%28JSON-RPC%29#PHP I'm thinking that on first usage, it seamlessly creates a new account and uploads the public key of the first bitcoin address in your wallet. Then you sign further POST requests using that key. That way the server can verify that you are who you claim to be.Should a person need to have their public key changed/removed (because they lost their wallet) then they can contact the server admins and they can decide how/whether to delete their account so they can create a new one. Seems that domain names doesn't need to be part of your web browser. Why not do:Code:BAR=$(grep google /etc/hosts | split 1)firefox $BARYou know it's not the same. Code:import urllibimport decimalimport jsonclass JSONRPCException(Exception):    def __init__(self, rpcError):        Exception.__init__(self)        self.error = rpcError        class ServiceProxy(object):    def __init__(self, serviceURL, serviceName=None):        self.__serviceURL = serviceURL        self.__serviceName = serviceName    def __getattr__(self, name):        if self.__serviceName != None:            name = "%s.%s" % (self.__serviceName, name)        return ServiceProxy(self.__serviceURL, name)    def __call__(self, *args):         postdata = json.dumps({"method": self.__serviceName, 'params': args, 'id':'jsonrpc'})         respdata = urllib.urlopen(self.__serviceURL, postdata).read()         resp = json.loads(respdata, parse_float=decimal.Decimal)         if resp['error'] != None:             raise JSONRPCException(resp['error'])         else:             return resp['result']         This should work in Python is anybody ever needs it. I've updated the wiki,https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_tutorial_%28JSON-RPC%29#PythonIt's based off the old lib. Usernames are case insensitive and can contain any character.Urls can have port numbers and paths attached.**@genjix@** rules@fishysnax.com:443/path/to/That's a valid address. The username = "**@genjix@** rules"Now the URL is called using some remote methods like url + path + '/getaddress/' so that the implementation is non-specific to PHP. Anybody is free to create their own specific implementation with their own server policy. The current policy happens to be very simple (update record, set password, get address).Like a user who wanted to setup their own private provider could setup an implementation on their server and disable creation of new accounts.Obviously I want to get something in there with PK crypto... But haven't come up with a properly secure scheme yet. Many of them are prone to MITM attacks. However this can be used for small amounts effectively like a post on irc for somebody to send you X BTC to genjix@foo.org without having to open bitcoin.There's 2 class of queries- the public fetch record (uses GET) and the 2 calls to change things and require a password (and hopefully more security in the future- uses POST).The POST queries return a JSON. If there's a key by the name of "status" then it was successful and the value will give you an update as to what occured. If there's a key called "error" then it was unsuccessful and the value is an error message. The JSONs can also have other entries depending. No, I was complaining about the fact that the Bitcoin JSON-RPC Api uses numbers (that nearly all libraries convert to floats and have no option to change) when using strings would only be minorly impactful. GMP is an integer only library,http://codepad.viper-7.com/pj58SK
Yeah those are integer values,var_dump(gmp_strval(gmp_div_q(gmp_init("5"), gmp_init("2"))));output:string(1) "2"  Here's my solution, http://codepad.viper-7.com/tbZ9oDCode:<?php$quot = gmp_init("5");$divis = gmp_init("2");# number of decimals$precision = 2;$shift = gmp_pow("10", $precision);$quot = gmp_mul($quot, $shift);$res = gmp_div_q($quot, $divis);$repr = gmp_strval($res);$dotpos = strlen($repr) - $precision;$repr = substr($repr, 0, $dotpos) . "." . substr($repr, $dotpos);echo "Number is $repr";$res = gmp_init($repr);Multiply the quotient by 10^p (p = precision), perform the integer division, convert to string, insert the decimal point, convert back to GMP. ShadowOfHarbringer: Do you know how to divide numbers in PHP GMP and obtain a decimal number (not quotient + remainder)? This is stubborness... Now I'm trying to integrate Bitcoin into a website but the JSON-RPC library only returns floats.Why can't Bitcoin return strings?You're deliberately breaking with all the languages (python JSON-RPC library, PHP JSON-RPC and Perl JSON-RPC). Using floats anywhere in financial transactions is unacceptable.php's json_decode DOESN'T support anyway to return floats as strings. The option doesn't exist.PHP solution: write/maintain my own JSON parser.Neither does Python's JSON-RPC. Have to write my own JSON-RPC lib using json module instead of using the one that already exists.Same for Perl.Really, why is it such a big deal? Bitcoin is broken and this needs fixing. I think you did.- BitDNS is a block chain decentralised DNS system.- DNS-like means a system like DNS (federated servers). http://poker.bitcoinvegas.com/Looking for investors. lol... this is why hackers make poor designers. We think differently to usual people.Usual people like sites like yahoo.com , use MSN messenger, have a facebookMe- I go on IRC and use email.So I sometimes have trouble when designing interfaces for general use because I start thinking about what *I* would like. I reckon many of you have the same problem but aren't mindful of it. Like the constructors of the Titanic who made sure to include enough lifeboats? This is a perfect design. I was going to get around to doing this, but you've already done the job.The flow is perfect. From top to bottom:- What is Bitcoin.- Where to get it.- Now what to do with it.Any new person will be interested in those topics. I vote this for the new front page design.Nice. Simple. Uncluttered. Concise.Couldn't be better.Add this:And remove the drop shadow for the coin. It's inconsistent with your plain flat colouring on the rest of the page.I like the alignment, although I'm not sure about the download buttons. Having all 4 there is claustrophobic. Maybe better to get rid of the left Windows button and replace it with some javascript that expands the blue bar to offer the 2 windows download urls below when clicked.Soon there will be both 32bit and 64 bit Linux versions, and you can't just keep adding more buttons!If there's no javascript enabled then the page will simply offer the links straight up.[Windows] [Mac OS X] [Linux]Windows expands the bar to show below:- Windows Exe (Recommended)- Windows ZipMac OS X is a normal URL.Linux expands to:- Linux (Recommended)- Linux 64bit- Debian package I like the idea, but it means that a) people need bitcoins b) I would need 2 emails; 1 for people using this system and 1 for the plebs that don't (I'd recommend them to switch to this).But why wasn't hash cash ever implemented? Newsletters and mailing lists do count as spam to me, and I maintain separate emails for all that junk. Something like hashmail would be great for personal emails and spam free! (so I would never be worried about posting my email all over the net) - I'm not restricted how I spend my Bitcoins. Governments make it really difficult to deposit money online to play poker. Poker is banned in Washington state, Turkey, Thailand. UK has a bunch of restrictions... France cannot play on international sites. Russia, India, and a bunch of other places it's illegal.- I've got friends in Iran. They contribute a lot to Free Software projects, but because of sanctions they find it impossible to pay for stuff they need web space .etc- I own the Bitcoins. Not in some place, but actually on my hard drive.- Coins are dividable to many decimal places.- I am my own master. I can be truly independent in a Bitcoin economy if such a thing exists. Right now it's impossible for me to boycott corruption.- Microtransactions. Will revolutionise the way artists/producers earn on the internet. Will really step up the game and improve the internet.- Anonymous (you say it isn't but with precaution it is). Not much to add here, except that if you had a basic reference implementation written in Python, then that'd be excellent.Bitcoin should be broken down, and then there should be a core from which all the other components are built around. Imagine something *really* basic and difficult to use but very flexible for people to add new features to. I would also support calling Linux per GNU_OS if GNU wasn't such an ugly name. Linux has a catchy edge to it. plenty of good free 3D engines around.is the source code open? I'm not sure you understand how the patch works...And lookups are done with bog standard MySQL. You can't get faster than that. And talking about speed here for a name lookup is premature.Still not sure what you're arguing... Are you saying that each user is assigned a subdomain like: genjix.wikipedia.org ? But you still need to set the records or new passwords using bitcoin. ATM that's done by POST requests using bitcoin rpc commands (setnewpassword, updatens).The only change is that now you require that anybody that wishes to setup a provider must also setup a DNS.Like this anybody can buy a cheap webhosting service with a free DNS. Then they create an account and disable others making new accounts (so it's only for them).What does have a DNS offer in exchange? Here you can see a request, http://fishysnax.com/getaddress/?nickname=genjixJust asking. Why? Not everyone wants to get a hostname and they prefer to use a provider. doesnt work on linux And that has what to do with this patch.......? You must be using the gitorious branch from luke-jr... Try this version https://github.com/genjix/spesmiloI guarantee that's stable. Spesmilo isn't unstable but it requires a patch to bitcoin that has been ignored,http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3856.0This is needed. But nobody has merged it in yet.
Try it. Should work I think.Could you turn on SSL as well for me to test?BTW GET is enabled for accessing people's addresses, like:http://fishysnax.com/getaddress/?nickname=genjix(but not for anything else). Hey,Posted this yesterday but it hasn't got many views/replies...

Still owe him 50 BTC  -1 disagree. From https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/107Following Ubuntu's method of distribution, here's how I think Bitcoin should be offered:1) There should be 2 packages:bitcoin-x.y.zbitcoin64-x.y.z(distributing 32 bit and 64 bit builds respectively)2) For both of these packages, bitcoin is in the top level directory.3) bitcoind is 'hidden' in a subdirectory (like bin)4) The main page has 2 download links like:Bitcoin for Linux (Recommended)Bitcoin for Linux (64 bit)The current structure is confusing for non-technical users. See http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3904.0 for the reason why.An alternative proposal is in the first url at the start of this post.Why are there 2 windows packages (zip and exe) btw? Europe languished. America survived.Looking to the future... ignoring the past.Suburban sprawl engulfing the land,A lifeless blob, mindlessly expands,Like birds of a feather, the rich flock together,Are we building cities for cars or for people? That's an awesome story. Thanks for sharing. You should check out a program called 'Connections' by James Burke (it's free on youtube). He's a famous science historian.But that's wrong for the simple fact that innovativity comes from creativity, and creativity is the ability to draw on wide disparate sources of knowledge- often from different fields. What you said was maybe true of the society 100 years (even 50 years) ago during the industrial age, but less so today. Narrow minded people lack the ability to see the bigger picture due to their proverbial tunnel vision.Today generalists are more important than ever in the age of the knowledge workers. Who cares about patents once Bitcoin becomes illegal. Argue this false statement to me. Explain? I'm curious. today i visit about 2 sites (bitcoin & slashdot). mostly i search stuff i want. (there's enough out there for me to be choosy)however when i use freenet, there's not many sites about so i have to click around... it gives me some idea of what it must've been like to 'surf the web' when there weren't many sites around on the net. (before my time)when I'm without net, I get a disconnected feeling. Like I'm missing out on the chaos. Yet I grew up around all of this.What must it have been like? The first time on the net, exposed to this new stimulus of being linked to others... Slowly rolling yourself across amateur sites... Surfing the crest of the web.SYN I know, it's bullshit, right? In today's world where economy is a zero sum game, we need to edge out our competitors. Crush all other countries. Jealously guard our innovations to maximise profit. Close the sourcecode. We need a strong eugenics program to allow the weak to die off (all scientists are super healthy after all). Anybody that can't afford healthcare- tough luck! Since most of you are poor, the majority of you will be in bad health and unable to work- hah!Dinosaur from the 40s. It will run the 32 bit version.There aren't any bitcoin builds for those platforms anyway so the point is moot.BTW, this is the new request https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/107 seriously stop trying to bloat bitcoin A make cup of tea function. I really enjoy reading these. Could each new one of these be stickied until the new one appears every week?It's good documentation too. Maybe it could go on the front page!We should collect these somewhere. I've been doing this for years! It's fine.Must've saved you a lot of time to discover you don't need to detach anymore  _
So I made this, http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3451.0Where are all my bitches?Or does it need to be ported to C++?Supports internationalisation and everything. I just need to add a screen for downloading the block chain and a settings window (have been a little busy with other projects last 2 weeks). Would use INT128 so it can be claimed that Bitcoin is 'infinitely divisible' (well that's near enough for most people) as a selling point.Right now saying it's 8 decimals divisible isn't so catchy. You are the leech.In evolutionary studies there's something called the ESS (evolutionary stable strategy). You make a population with 2 types- cooperate and defect. To co-operate is mutually unbeneficial but good for the group. Defect is opposite.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategyYou make a payoff matrix and generate simulations. Generally populations full of defect will die out or swing towards the ESS. Populations full of co-operate are sustainable until invaded by individuals of defect, at which point they swing towards the ESS. The ESS is the stable ratio of cooperate : defect individuals. Nearly always the ESS is majority co-operate and minority defect.So if you're one person taking advantage of everybody else's co-operate attitude for yourself, then you are the leech. Like a person draining bittorrent downloads. Society is a live support system. Without it you'd be nothing. We've come to rely on it for everything- that's why we're able to do amazing things.Selection happens at some level on groups. Unhealthy tribes would have gone extinct in the past. Which tribes would be more successful? Those that mutually helped their fellow men during times of hard stress, or those that didn't?Even early Homo Erectus have been found with fatal injuries that have healed, indicating they were taken care of for a substantial number of years. It's egregious to claim that humans aren't a social species.But there's no point quoting science anyway. You've chosen your religion of Rand, and nothing I say will make you question your faith. From East to West... from North to South... from Developed to Undeveloped... a thousand conduits whisper before we say a word.Light speed pulses. Infinite. Infinitesimal. Our world is shrinking.I speak, it's gone. I die, it dies with me. I transmit, it lives forever.Curling humans through space, to turbid worlds. Old stories, new futures. A butterfly flaps forever: it's only a day.Past days are gone. Forget those damp brown days.Our future has colour, life, speed. Our future has more.The potential is within us. It always has been. haha worst of both worlds, best of none. Pull request is here, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/104 Should wallet encryption be done using GPG or RSA + AES?With RSA + AES you'd still have to store the private key somewhere. My inclination would be to store them inside the wallet but now that means you're only protected by a password. A page of bad writing. What is there to comment? Glancing the page, I see numerous grammar mistakes.Read 'Elements of Style' and practice your copy-editing skills on Wikipedia. Then come back with at least a chapter of good writing. Writing isn't easy but you haven't written much.Bear in mind that people here don't read fiction. You do know that Julian Assange is the original developer of nmap?Here's what he wrote for another tool:Also on his hacker past:He's basically saying I'm a proud hacker but more than a cracker. If forum becomes moderated, I leave.It's bad enough you have rules for the marketplace.I bet the majority of people voting for regulation are Americans. Americans don't represent all the countries. this is the one forum i like. please don't ruin it. lots of chaos and different points of view. Or ISPs will just migrate us more and more behind NATs killing peering & bittorrent and making us back into consumers. thank you. Removing that header is a good idea. I remember posting Bitcoin somewhere and that was the first thing people remarked about. what isn't? Why did they choose such a format?Why not free a top level IP (e.g 200 as an example) and then whenever that byte is selected, you can have variable length fields:200.num_of_bytes.89.123.42.76.43.108.2Or change each each number field to a 64 bit int.7843843.9084394.12333232.89Therefore since some sites need IP addresses, ISPs and router manufacturers would lose out by not providing access to those addresses. ipv6 is ridiculous made by academics. Do they honestly believe the whole internet to upgrade to a non-backwards compatible address? I think the amount he's offering is just a bonus for people who want to make happen a Bitcoin exchange. After all they are releasing the code for free, and many work on free software projects for free. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dp2Zqk8vHwthis experiment sums it all up. OpenID is a piece of piss to integrate into a website. Not too hard to use either. haha this gets more ridiculous by the minute. its called OpenIDSupported by Google, Facebook, Yahoo, ...
EkeforteEsperanto for sudden yet strong.FidecoThe quality of trust.FortikemaHaving a propensity for being a robust/sturdy person or thing. Not json but json-rpc as recommended by json-rpc themselves.http://json-rpc.org/wiki/python-json-rpc How about something also showing how many donations that person has made? Would encourage/pressure people into tipping others too  Yeah well I haven't been too happy at the response. I was told: "let us know what needs to be done to make a client wrapper possible. everything should be possible through the RPC".- Need initialisation flag. Submit patch. Patch ignored. Workaround hack (that doesn't even work for all cases) proposed instead.- Not able to import bitcoin RPC values into Python. Propose I write my own JSON RPC lib because Python's implementation is wrong.- Propose consistent naming scheme for JSON-RPC Api. WONTFIX. Better to leave the inconsistent usage of getblaa or doaction because it's not a problem now.I mean wtf. Come on. Does DBUS work on Windows or Mac?It's the default used in all Linux desktops. It's a mature, battle-hardened protocol.http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus So what's your proposal? I'm willing to get behind this. Show us the code. That's code to parse JSONs. There's a Python library to work with JSON-RPC. There's also a PHP library to do JSON-RPC. Both use floats.Solution A: everybody that wishes to interface with Bitcoin in Python/PHP must write their own (potentially buggy) RPC http code because the default libs for those languages uses floats.Solution B: a small change is made to Bitcoin.B is a much better solution  Yep, just noticed that.But then the Python JSON-RPC library does not and I couldn't find one for the PHP RPC library either.Code:>>> from jsonrpc import ServiceProxy>>> access = ServiceProxy("http://user:password@127.0.0.1:8332")>>> type(access.getbalance())<type 'float'>BTW, in that wiki page why did you use those lambdas instead of simply using decimal.Decimal? Multiplying by e8 will cause everything like version numbers or difficulty to be multiplied. Python uses floats for it's JSON library. Herein lies the problems.$ python>>> import json>>> json.dumps(10.001)'10.000999999999999'>>> json.loads('{"blaa": 0.333331}'){u'blaa': 0.33333099999999999}>>> type(json.loads('{"blaa": 0.333331}')['blaa'])<type 'float'>This is unacceptable. This would solve a bunch of problems.Why not just return the int64 and let the client cast it to a float & divide 10^8 for display?Currently since the JSON RPC returns floats, any library you use will return the values as floats, not strings. So to get the int64 value you need to multiply the float by 10^8 and cast to an int for internal usage.Also by returning the value as int64, it will be enforcing good practice on clients instead of them unwittingly using floats. I know a few details of this move and am not allowed to share them publicly.However rest assured that it's nothing to do with Baron and mtgox is being moved to a more reliable host (guy actually runs an ISP) who will be doing everything with the proper paperwork i.e making mtgox legit. yes! great work  woah, so Jed is of the eDonkey fame? motherfucking hero. I remember that software being the centre piece of my life as a kid. ptmhd:- speedy delivery- everything as advertised- up to date with all info- included extras (webcam, pcmcia network card, english coins!)A++thanks Say I wanted to make a website selling newspapers in a country where it's illegal to buy them. What technologies could I use?Freenet only serves static pages AFAIK, so not sure if that would be appropriate since it only hands out content but doesn't provide a way for users to interact with the site (discreetly or publicly).Would a tor service fit the job here? What other tools exist?The aim is to provide some level of protection for buyers of newspapers on the site (enough to make the government go after easier fish) and make it difficult to attack the site owner. he exploited security problems in the mtgox site and deserves his entire funds to be taken. If you want it then make it  i recommend you PM ptmhttp://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3817.0He sold me an IBM Thinkpad T41, 1.5 GHz Pentium M, 1.5 GB RAM, 80 GB HDDfor 150 BTCI still owe 50 to him I know he has some PowerPC iBooks left. Pics: http://uselessguy.com/ibook/ Get on it then  There's no administrators.Bitcoins uses a cryptographic address. You can see the flow of money around the network. That's not stopping somebody using a mixing service to obfuscate the origins of their money, so no.None. You store then on your computer. You can use a service like mybitcoin to store them for you.Nothing. You lost your identity and the criminal has access to all your emails, passwords, bitcoins, .etc Maybe you can buy insurance to protect yourself. I don't want such a service since I can protect myself more adequately than any bank and am willing to take on the risk for when I do.Nothing.Nothing.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IH4iLhhL7k&t=6m30sAnd part2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN_A_NIDjM0 (until 2 mins in)This puts it all in perspective for me. yeah why argue about things you cannot change. it's just wasting your time and making yourself angry over nothing. we live in the world. this is how it is. work with what you have instead of trying to reform it, and if you can cause concrete changes then that's great. From past experience other projects I worked on tried to use summer of code to recruit outside developers. Mostly it turned into fail because these devs would leave after it ended dumping a mass of incomplete code they didn't maintain.If this is done then I suggest recruiting from the ranks of developers already working in or around bitcoin. Can I co-opt your page for the wiki? With corrections.I will link your article on the talk page. Why not keep an up-to-date TODO list of small tasks for new developers to get mucked into? A launchpad. hahaha! great idea Yeah but this is a necessary trade-off for people who aren't technical users. If they lose their keys.Prompting for a new password after every send or new address is made would be annoying. Maybe it can be done like PokerStars- they have a normal password entry to login (with the option to save the password) but you can also upgrade to an RSA key entry token device. Maybe we could look into issuing those for bitcoin users who want more security at a small fee.Yep, and I don't like messing with the user's keys either.Sounds pretty comprehensive and better than what I've done. Can anyone see a point of failure in this scheme? Religion or no religion who cares. I think the idea is pretty crazy myself but who am I to judge? I believe some outlandish things myself.This is a pointless argument for people with too much time on their hands. We live in a free world. If you manage to figure out that (recomputing the hashes through shell) then that'd be great for everybody. I'm also curious how to do this. I think most of us are the same way. At least I am. Yes. Agreed. I doubt the OP is a scammer. He's made helpful posts in other threads. You must have misunderstood & I wasn't clear enough:The CPU is 64 bit.The kernel is compiled for 32 bit.uname -m displays i686. If uname -m showed the hardware arch then it would display x86_64, no? Therefore I conclude that uname -m is displaying the machine hardware type as compiled into the kernel, not detected from proc.I'm inclined to think that uname -m is simply reporting back the compiled flags inside the kernel.Here is the terminal output on this dual processor system:Note the presence of lm (64bit CPU) but reporting of i686 from uname. No, because if it was the other way around then uname -m would show 64 bit on the 32bit version of Ubuntu. How much could you get by with in NH? What's wrong with the Euro currency? Don't know too much about this. What license? Am I free to use these in my next site?Suggestions:Half the size for coin and halve the pixel size.Use low-key colours- give it a faded gold look.Add a bit of shine in a band across them. That's because it's meant to be integrated into a client (which I'm also working on making).The user just sees a big shiny restore wallet button. Is that platform agnostic? AFAIK aren't some distros replacing the classic init runlevel?I'm on a computer with a 64bit processor but 32bit Ubuntu. uname -m shows i686 It is Esperanto
can I have access please?genjix on githubstill working on it... http://pastebin.com/KcgUBaU7 I wrote this program,https://github.com/genjix/sekureco/blob/master/sekurecoTogether with a cloud backup service (see www),https://github.com/genjix/sekurecoI need someone to vet the security by me explaining what it does. I also need to clean up the code (comments, organisation, consistent naming), but for now it encrypts / backs up to server.For integrating inside a bitcoin client../sekureco is a command line tool you can run with help instructions. See README also.It works by using symmetric encryption for the wallet file (AES) and encrypting the AES key using an asymmetric encryption scheme (RSA).For the server backup side, you upload (once only) your RSA keypair + encrypted AES key. The server responds with a 40 character long random ID code which you then use to upload your encrypted wallets. If the client wishes to backup their wallet they need the ID to download the latest version. If the user correctly enters the pass to the RSA keypair they can download the keys or ID (which can be used for fetching the encrypted wallets or uploading new versions). If they guess the pass incorrectly then the restore functionality for that account is locked for 10 hours. bitcoin.linuxCode:#!/bin/bashMACHINE_TYPE=`uname -m`WORKING_DIR=`basename $0`if [ ${MACHINE_TYPE} == 'x86_64' ]; then  # run 64-bit bitcoin here  $WORKING_DIR/bin/64/bitcoinelse  # run 32-bit bitcoin here  $WORKING_DIR/bin/32/bitcoinfiIdea came to me after a user on IRC was having trouble running bitcoin (didn't know their arch nor how to navigate in console nor about bitcoin/bitcoind distinction).My sister has been using bitcoin, and because of the long startup/multiple executables she was just going into every directory under bin and opening all the binaries repeatedly until it bitcoin opens. She assumed it was because bitcoin is broken. This script would also alleviate that problem. This is great news. I wonder why banks are so shitty as to not provide a simple API themselves.Is there a list around of which banks it supports? Unfreeze the money. Stop playing policeman. What happens outside mtgox is unrelated. It's a trading platform, nothing more. Doesn't a stock system require truthful reporting of a company's profits? How would such system work based on trust?Or if I sell shares in a company then decide to ignore what the shareholders demand? * genjix hello I have done this but am looking for someone to review the code and a VPS to host the service. How come they must trade with each other? Why not make it so they have to earn 100 BTC per business using these forums or whatever? yeah the OP was talking about in real life, but then as I looked into it I got excited at the idea of trying it on some free software projects I'm currently writing. OK.Can't wait to try this with another dev.Here's what I imagine over the net:Gobby or shared screen session + vim over SSH -XSkype for voice chatShame there's nothing like gobby for vim or vim mode for gobby... No it's not.There's no way to recover if there's some error starting the RPC server. Maybe if there's a SEGV signal you can catch the return value only.You're insisting on any wrapper around the bitcoin core to use hacks to implement incomplete functionality. The chance of losing 8 or more out of 9 games is:9N8 = from 9 choose 8 = 99*(0.5)^9 + (0.5)^9 = 10 * 0.5^9 = 2%In other words if 50 people played 9 games of double trouble then we expect 1 person to lose 8 or more games. So am I correct to say that:- The experienced coder is bogged down.- The inexperienced coder makes massive leaps to the level of the experienced coder.Definitely keen to try this out. I recommend kalyhost.comThey offer both VPS and web hosting. They're hosting the bitcoin wiki and pretty stable from what I've seen.

What are your experiences of pair programming when 1 person has significantly higher skill advantage than the other? Is it a good way to teach programming?How does it work in practice? Do they take turns to code while the other watches? Doesn't seem very efficient... Is there a looser way to code in pairs?I'm used to agile dev in general though, but am thinking whether I can use pair programming as a teaching tool by constructing shared projects. The usual teacher-student method is too dictatorial for my tastes. Not so true. You do the 'work' on free software because you want the project to be good and it has to be done. Likewise everyone in this project wants the organisation to do well- that's motivation to do the 'work'.It's just:- Dead wood people.- Aligning people's interest to keep the organisation healthy.- Fostering an environment where people take initiative, not orders.
search genjix and vote up my comment ^^ What's your address and I'll send you 100 BTC. I will definitely try to get that 50 BTC ASAPI can show you how to use gdb to debug (my setup is usually jam/makefiles/qmake/cmake, vim, gdb, ...). I can look into it, but know that it'd just be something I read & tried from a tutorial, not that I use myself daily. Click the links...Need BTC for the laptop (or paypal -_-) Same here. the ise/ize endings I routinely switch between (prefer the -ise endings though), whereas other words like colour I always use the British spelling. Well that T42 looks great. Would 150 BTC be fine? I have 100 BTC so just got to find a way to get the extra 50,See if you need anything from http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3818.0 for 50 BTC. I used to work for a group like this that worked on free software. There was 2 arms to the organisation: pay the bills workers (web dev, system setup, admin, ...) and research which I was part of doing 3D dev.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_developmenthttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CooperativeOne of the problems I saw was if some people become unproductive or turn out not to be very useful then they become a drain on the organisation. How do you then boot them without creating bad blood? Some types of work are hard to objectively evaluate because they bring added value that isn't immediate to see (or tangible to measure).My future plan is to make an organisation like this anyway since it allows everyone to work on whatever cool stuff they want and is more productive. The charger and keyboard don't bother me at all.Do you want the laptops back later because the IBM seems good enough to last me for a while (might put off getting a good computer).I'm trying to boycott paypal wherever possible.

The IBM looks good  I only have 100 BTC... How should I pay you? My laptop broke and I want a temporary system until I get a better computer later.(I'm from UK)Looking around at parts it seems I can get one for around ~170 or $230? (Monitor for 70 and desktop for 100)Is it possible to go any cheaper since this is a temporary system?

Try to be more objective. huh? by bubble I do not mean a crash to 0... Just bitcoin losing 1/4 - 1/2 of it's parity value. agree LOL I was right! SUCK IT! I will buy $30 FTP off you for 20 btcNobody will burn their valuable BTC for hard to liquidate FTP at below market prices. As fast as it takes to compute 1 hash theoretically... jgarzik, since you're not running pastecoin anymore, have you considered putting the sourcecode back online? It's a great example for vendors on how to integrate bitcoin and I don't mind cleaning up the hackish code for people. 2 days and bitcoin has gone from 0.95 BTC / $ to 1.16 BTC / $ 
thanks for that + the PM You're talking about allopatric genetic drift (see left column),The longest chain of the two after being merged becomes the main one. quite likely. probably happened a few times too. Also in the GMail account the signature field had a bunch of smileys like:(: (: (: (: But Russians don't use those kind of smileys. They write )) like that )))  some more stuff )))))However when checking the logs, the first 4 IP addresses were from Russia. My bank is fucking rubbish with security. When I log into internet banking they ask for any 1 of my answers to 3 secret questions (mothers maiden name, first school .etc - no numbers) and 3 random digits of my 6 digit passphrase!!When I was reading the source code to their webpages, they were written for netscape navigator.No, I'd rather not pay the premium for their security/fraud protection. nothx, I can secure myself faaarrrr better.That fraud protection you get isn't free. They cover that with fees, and the service in return is very poor. It's like insurance or warranty on a purchase- if you're sensible (and the risk isn't a significant portion of your savings) then it's a bad investment. I saw that.Why do they need 50k for? That's retardedly huge. All the developers have everything they need. They don't need an office since everybody works from home. In short: why 50k?If it's some silly German law, why not setup in a cheaper country. I'm sure you can pay 1/50th that in a developing country. If this is how they spend money then it seems silly to donate to them.Let me get this straight. They decided that Germany (which requires 50k upfront) is the best choice... Followed by the UK. Seriously?? The UK? wtf. The land of the most restrictive IP laws, censorship, mandatory internet blacklist, worst libel laws in all of Europe?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_United_Kingdom that's great. thanks. Go to 4chan and recruit girls there. And how do you detect such an event? Then how come the price of BTC has gone from 1$ = 0.95 BTC to $1 = 1.06 BTC overnight? The bid price on mtgox is now 0.91 ($1 = 1.1 BTC)Last 48 hours,Price is starting to swing now that the effect of the dark pool's coverup is weakening. >aspiring Mark Zuckerbergs ohgodno seriously if bitcoin is destined to go mainstream then it's bound to happen regardless of 'image'. quite simply because it's so unique and there's nothing else like it.i say allow the freedom of expression. it's the best way to develop ideas to strengthen bitcoin. you might not see the value in offering drugs for bitcoin, but neither did people in the past at other outlandish ideas.nothing has to be done. just sit back, ride the wave and work like beavers. the types of people easily put off by these things aren't that valuable anyway (rats jumping ship at first sign of trouble). sudo aptitude install python-m2crypto git  git clone git://github.com/genjix/sekureco.git  cd sekureco  ./sekureco helpEnjoy.https://github.com/genjix/sekureco Actually adding transactions is optional.

From wikipedia,A new study by Samuel Bowles at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, US, is seen by some as breathing new life into the model of group selection for altruism, known as "Survival of the nicest". Bowles conducted a genetic analysis of contemporary foraging groups, including Australian aboriginals, native Siberian Inuit populations and indigenous tribal groups in Africa. It was found that hunter-gatherer bands of up to 30 individuals were considerably more closely related than was previously thought. Under these conditions, thought to be similar to those of the middle and upper Paleolithic, altruism towards other group-members would improve the overall fitness of the group.If an individual defended the group but was killed, any genes that the individual shared with the overall group would still be passed on. Early customs such as food sharing or monogamy could have levelled out the "cost" of altruistic behaviour, in the same way that income taxes redistribute income in society. He assembled genetic, climactic, archaeological, ethnographic and experimental data to examine the cost-benefit relationship of human cooperation in ancient populations. In his model, members of a group bearing genes for altruistic behaviour pay a "tax" by limiting their reproductive opportunities to benefit from sharing food and information, thereby increasing the average fitness of the group as well as their inter-relatedness. Bands of altruistic humans would then act together to gain resources from other groups at this challenging time in history.------------    * Dogs often adopt orphaned cats, squirrels, ducks and even tigers.[6]    * Dolphins support sick or injured animals, swimming under them for hours at a time and pushing them to the surface so they can breathe.[7]    * Wolves and wild dogs bring meat back to members of the pack not present at the kill.[citation needed]    * Male baboons threaten predators and cover the rear as the troop retreats.[citation needed]    * Gibbons and chimpanzees with food will, in response to a gesture, share their food with others of the group.[citation needed] Chimpanzees will help humans and conspecifics without any reward in return.[8]    * Bonobos have been observed aiding injured or handicapped bonobos.[9]    * Vampire bats commonly regurgitate blood to share with unlucky or sick roost mates that have been unable to find a meal, often forming a buddy system.[10][11]    * Raccoons inform conspecifics about feeding grounds by droppings left on commonly shared latrines. A similar information system has been observed to be used by common ravens.[12]    * In numerous bird species, a breeding pair receives support in raising its young from other "helper" birds, including help with the feeding of its fledglings.[13] Some will even go as far as protecting an unrelated bird's young from predators [14]    * Most mammal carnivores like wolves or dogs have a habit of not harming pack members below certain age, of opposite sex or in surrendering position (in case of some animals, the behavior exists within entire species rather than one pack).[citation needed]    * Vervet Monkeys give alarm calls to warn fellow monkeys of the presence of predators, even though in doing so they attract attention to themselves, increasing their personal chance of being attacked.[15]    * Walruses have been seen adopting orphans who lost their parents to predators.[16]    * Some termites release a sticky secretion by fatally rupturing a gland near the skin in their neck. This autothysis defends against invading ants by creating a tar baby effect.[17]    * Meerkats often have one standing guard to warn whilst the rest feed in case of predators attack.    * African buffalo will rescue a member of the herd captured by predators.--------------http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_selection#Multilevel_selection_theoryIn recent years, the limitations of earlier models have been addressed, and newer models suggest that selection may sometimes act above the gene level. Recently David Sloan Wilson and Elliot Sober have argued that the case against group selection has been overstated. They focus their argument on whether groups can have functional organization in the same way individuals do and, consequently, whether groups can also be "vehicles" for selection. For example, groups that cooperate better may have out-reproduced those that did not. Resurrected in this way, Wilson & Sober's new group selection is usually called multilevel selection theory....MLS goes further by saying that selection for the group level, which is competition between groups, must outweigh the individual level, which is individuals competing within a group, for a group-beneficiating trait to spread.the equation for Hamilton's rule:[22]        rb > c(where b represents the benefit to the recipient of altruism, c the cost to the altruist, and r their degree of relatedness) should be replaced by the more general equation        (rbk + be) > c.....Fehr provides evidence of group selection taking place in humans presently with experimentation through logic games such as prisoners dilemma, the type of thinking that humans have developed many generations agoHerbert Gintis approaches cultural evolution of group selection in a much more statistical approach to prove that societies that promote pro-social norms, as in group selection, have higher survival rates than societies that do not.[27] He does so by developing a multilevel gene-culture coevolutionary model that explains the process whereby altruistic social norms will hinder socially harmful and fitness reducing norms and consequently will be internalized. In his equations, he differentiates between a genetic group selection model that is sensitive to group size and migration rates versus his own model that is much less affected by these constraints and therefore more accurate.----------------Philosophy is pseudoscience and a bad source to base your beliefs on. altruistic means behaviours which benefit others at a negative cost to yourselfselfish means behaviours which benefit yourself more than others.your definition of feeling good for doing a selfish act is altruistic. are we supposed to do good and feel miserable?if our genetic programming makes us feel good for doing selfless acts then that makes us altruistic, not selfish... You can watch hours and hours of Ayn Rand put up by her fans on youtube. It's clear that she is nothing more than a class-A bitch advocating for her Ubermensch (the rich). With crappy reasoning like she formed her conclusion first. The core root of her ideas are rubbish, yet you think she has some good ideas about smoking... or something.lol, so the turd finally droped from the anus. The trailer looks so so so bad. Why would anyone make a (possibly three part given this is part one) film out of such a pile of crap.People writing free software are selfish? what? I've spent many years around those types and many of them are idealistic about building good software. No selfish acts there. You think nameless developers are in it for 'gaining reputation'- erm what kind of world do you live in where online anon reputation is worth anything? And hardly any projects make money.There many selfless acts around you and documented in science literature. But they don't conform with your belief so you ignore them.Except they do, but you'd rather read guesses by philosophers than examine hard study. Ipse dixit.I can't be bothered to give you a science education that you're missing here, but basically hamilton's rule for kin selection states: rB > Cr = relatednessB = reproductive benefit to receipient of altrusitic behaviourC = cost to giver of the behaviourThis directly comes out of the beliefs of gene selection which implies the genetic selecting behaviour and some altruism when the r*B is bigger than C (selfish genes ensuring their survival) and "i'll scratch your back if you scratch mine" (reciprocity). And it fits for a many species of animals.Actual behavioural science found the case to be the opposite with many counter cases, although the model holds for most models. i.e men who jump on grenades in war to save their comrades, chimpanzees adopting other young, animals self-sacrificing themselves to predators.Dawkins tries to explain this off as misfiring of the genes (i.e faults in our genetic programming) but the evidence is too large to be hand-waved away... And he's a bit of a extinct dodo defending his years-old theory of gene selection against any attack.Evolutionary biologists now mostly accept multilevel selection whereby gene selection is the strongest but selection also occurs at other levels for animals- gene, individual, group, tribe, nation, speciesThe crux goes like if you split a species into a few groups, then if the gene's survival (not individual) depends on the strength of their group (size, wellbeing .etc) and the worst of the many groups will be culled... then evolutionarily if the group strength is dependent on the number/magnitude of altruistic members, the low-altruism groups will be selected *against* and altruism becomes a selected trait.Humans have some of the strongest group selection going on. Only a few tiers behind mole rats which are the only non-insect eusocial animal (eusocial = hive behaviour like ants, bees, ...) although this is largely in part to workers being sterile and so the best chance of gene selection is self-sacrifice.And in early economics they tried to model people as perfectly self-interested rational interests. It's now known that people are not at all rational (utility theory- people will not worry about $3 price difference when spending $300 but will drive across town to save $3 when spending $6) nor are they self-interested (experimental failure of prisoner's dilemma).http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Uos2fzIJ0What are the motivations for that guy? Is he seeking to preserve his reputation (when his reputation is not worth ~$80k)? Or does he have faulty programming?Trying to use philosophy and these platonic derivatives to make a point about human nature is retarded. It's like how philosophers used to write about the workings of the universe. Just like how psychology is being superseded by neuroscience, philosophy is being superseded by science. You can't look at the results of a complex system and try to make guesses about how it works... You have to work bottom up. Working on it. If anybody wants to discuss this in IRC, I need somebody to run my ideas past them to make sure it's secure. why not just record your desktop while you build the package from scratch, sign the package with a key you display in the video & upload pkg. put video on youtube. extra points for 2nd webcam video of monitor. yeah, totally... thanks for trying to help out but i dont know about windows. hopefully in a few days i'll get nanotube & others to help me build packages for everybody.for now this is a pre-alpha test for ubuntu users. to make sure there's no bugs for test release.

Hey,So I want to detect when bitcoind is running but that RPC server hasn't yet started up.The way bitcoind checks whether it's already running is by using boost::file_lockhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/boost/interprocess/sync/file_lock.hppAny ideas how to use this in python? I could create my own binding for python but I'd rather not have a compilable dependency for such a minor thing.The problem with checking a systems processes is that it's unreliable to assume the program is always called bitcoin (i.e different server implementations).I tried a different file-lock library:Code:$ bitcoind$ sudo apt-get install python-lockfile$ pythonimport lockfilelock = lockfile.FileLock('.bitcoin')with lock:    print lock.path'.bitcoin'$ cd .bitcoin/$ pythonimport lockfilelock = lockfile.FileLock('.lock')with lock:    print lock.path'.lock'Any ideas how to do this? Must be cross-platform. File locking is an OS function, so maybe I'm not using the correct file? Yesterday night there was 1.1 BTC per $. This morning it was 0.9 BTC per $ briefly.- Small core community.- Not many services. People mainly using bitcoin as an investment vehicle.- Sharp increases in value.+ Linux users tend to be idealists and not invest in something because of money necessarily.+ Lots of outside interest recently.I conclude a large chance of a bubble soon happening. Anybody know how to make the browser part for firefox & chrome that will trigger program X with the URL? If so, then PM me and I'll implement this. I did a bit of investigation and came across this page,                                                                                                        http://www.laptopjacks.com/view_part/LG-Laptop-DC-Power-Jack-LG41225.htmlPart Number: LG41225Center pin diameter: 2.5mm(and lists my laptop there as LG P300)However my laptop has 5 contact points whereas that picture only has 3.I then saw this power jack which I believe is the same type,http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=400145746359What does that metal cover do? For the description of another unrelated power jack, I saw "If your old jack has 3 pins only, you can easily remove the metal shield covering the DC Jack" <- so why do I need it?meh... any suggestions? I found half of the power jack I need... now it just needs it's winter jacket. as to what else people will do:participate in a knowledge economy where everybody gains instead of competing in a zero-sum one. western population is decreasing. that's why governments import clever brown people (immigration). most growth estimates for humans place a cap. where the cap lies differs according to various risk estimates,there's an interesting effect that newly urbanised countries shop drops in fertility and more as they become developed. many western countries are still shrinking far below 2.1 children per family which is the replacement rate.so overpopulation is not a worry for me. esp since no government agency finds it a worry either.also the UN predicts that famine will in a few decades disappear... currently most food shortages in the world today are the result of dictators and war. There ARE fringe people who live in the sea and in deserts!http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00rrd81/Human_Planet_Oceans_Into_the_Blue/http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00rrd85/Human_Planet_Deserts_Life_in_the_Furnace/(worth watching those documentaries btw- one of the best documentaries I've ever seen)- Nomads who navigate by means of sand dunes in the Sahara for 2 weeks to find tiny water wells.- Men digging 10m underground linking km's of tunnels to get flowing water.- People who live on boats their whole lives. Some boys even have eyes more adapted to see underwater than on land.- A man that hunts deep underwater for up to 5 mins.Now tell me that the human race isn't the best race and capable of anything! The Earth is no more designed for us then we ourselves fit to it. The difference between man and the other animals is that we don't spend millions of years evolving to adapt to our environment, we fit our environment to us. Shaping Mars for habitation is not incredulous, and places well within the bracket of extremes people experienced through history.The issue here is your own mind, not our abilities. that intro vs the senate committee is not fiction and actually happened. that character is based off Robert Zubrin.The real version is far more dramatic,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5uImXbhQM8His plan named Mars Direct has been adopted by NASA for their Mars Design Reference mission by the mid 2030s and can be done within NASA's current budget over 10 years.This is a video of how such a mission would look (Mars Direct),http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ4KIB4GqEA https://www.kalyhost.com/I think this is the best webhost. They install any operating system for you in a virtual machine. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGixHhks9mcmaybe youll enjoy this video/itll help u improve thanks for sharing forget mining. It's too much of a hang-up for new people when it's a minor thing (for them). If they need to know more they can do research to find out.Maybe you don't realise how technical sounding that is. Let me highlight all the problem language:And it's very hard to follow.I'd rather pick 4 core ideas, forget everything else and drive those sole points home. No need to talk about the distributed blockchain, public keys or mining. What are the core ideas? Don't get bogged down in details- it's for non-technical people.- Distributed. We set the rules.- Microtransactions.- Transactions cost nothing.- AnonymousHow would you phrase this to the common man? I've heard the gold farming analogy for mining, but how about for everything else?How would you best explain distribution while allaying any security fears? dfdffd Thanks. you come here to argue. you don't need to use schoolchild fallacy put downs. if your argument is strong enough then state the facts. I suspect that you're young and inexperienced in these matters, but let me explain why I will ignore that paragraph.The first part is a classic example of an ad hominem:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem
cool  so the conspiracy is a factual conspiracy now Three information security consultancies with links to US spy agencies cooked up a dirty tricks campaign late last year to destroy Wikileaks by exploiting its perceived weaknesses, reads a presentation released by the whistleblowers' (pdf) organization that it claimed to be from the conspirators. Consultants at US defense contractors Palantir Technologies, Berico Technologies and HBGary proposed to lawyers for a desperate Bank of America an alliance that would work to discredit the whistleblowers' website using a divide and conquer approach. Since the plan was hatched, disgruntled volunteers mentioned in the PDF broke away from Wikileaks, financial institutions withdrew services, Apelbaum was harassed by the US Government and Amazon denied service to Wikileaks' website. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GenjixSee Free Software and Pigs deserve respect.Don't care for attribution.1APUj2DdGx9iQPvHgDhquXL2GB5U3ZdKUMWill get around to writing more so check back there often (you can take what you wish and publish/cut however you want from me without attribution).  you need the new version which is 3.x.20not on front page yet i dont think Everybody upgrades their client to use the new precision. fuck you! I would if I could! you quoted genjix not gene Whether the precision should be made larger from int64 to int128I'm sure the inventors of the internet didn't guess that ipv4 addresses would become exhausted. It's not a big deal to double the precision and much easier to change now than in the future.In the future if there's multiple implementations, then getting a universal upgrade from all clients will be impossibly difficult. How about the LSE (London Stock Exchange)? I take no view either way about most things (healthcare, public safety), but over regulation of city development is most definitely bad. It's because the US regulations for city development are a ton more stringent than here in Europe.Go to any pre-communist country and you'll see everywhere filled with huge motorways and nameless grey office blocks. Those kinds of cities are depressing for the people that live in them because there's very little variety as they're sheep herded around the city.All the most famous European cities (Prague, Krakow, Belgrade, Barcelona, Rome, Sofia, ...) are built around an old pedestrian city centre with the format of: main high street (usually without cars), monument (marker for orienting yourself) and park/greenery. That's natural development. Suburban cities have no such structure.You could draw an analogy here with if the internet was centrally controlled. Websites were 'allocated' and required strict planning permissions instead of evolving naturally to fit a need. http://rapidshare.com/files/70470980/how.i.found.freedom.in.an.unfree.world.7zhttp://www.megaupload.com/?d=1ASBH30D15mm3F6bV4jRHYYzwr5jbsYLaNtx4zPutN upload to rapidshare and post file here.SCAM! If it's just the JSON api then why not fix it when it becomes a problem? Upgrading an API to a new one is not a problem as much as upgrading a protocol.The real question is whether the precision should be made larger from int64 to int128I'm sure the inventors of the internet didn't guess that ipv4 addresses would become exhausted. It's not a big deal to double the precision and much easier to change now than in the future. wtf roads are the ugliest piece of shit ever. why the fuck does every person need to own a car with parking right outside his house because their fat ass is too lazy to walk 20 m to a car-park or take a train.here in europe everywhere is accessible by means of public transport. the reason american cities are so retarded (needing cars to go everywhere) is a result of amazingly retarded urban design due to extreme government regulation (suburbanism).It's like suburbanists prefer to build cities for cars, not people.See New Urbanism:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGJt_YXIoJIhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz-eSj9kQ4http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_urbanismIf roads wouldn't exist as much as they do now if government didn't exist, then perhaps it's because we dont need them EVERYWHERE!!suburbanism is the failed idea of a city being micromanaged by a central party, partitioned into specialised zones according to the industrial revolution philosophy. it's an epic failure. roads congest despite being optimised for efficiency (you have to travel from one specialised zone to the other side of the city for the next). people are depressed from spending all their time inside cars and lack of human interaction from bustling city centres. it's expensive, bad for the environment, urban sprawl, segregated (leading to rich areas and inner-city ghettos). absolute disaster. Is there any kind of peer2peer file server? Say we have a few laptops laying about and wish to share/mirror each other's files.A creates file wishlist.txtB, C and D all mirror this file on their own hard drives.B edits wishlist.txt, A edits wishlist.txt and there's a conflict. File splits into wishlist.B.txt and wishlist.A.txt otherwise the file is merged peacefully.Versioning/ability to revert files .etc Locking file ownership...It'd be a good collaboration/sharing tool for working with artwork rather than requiring a central server. Git is too restrictive and pedantic for anything outside of code. me and mtux are going to work on a newb-oriented client so that too will be fixed.bitcoinme.com sounds too spammy/like a sales pitch for my tastes. Hey,I want to propose a new main page.Today I did a drive-by 4chan while waiting to backup my computer. There was an economic argument raging with people lambasting banks and screaming about the government. I posted about bitcoin (the basic ideas) and watched with wry amusement only one person respond.It was a one-liner about the title on the site "If you have version 0.3.9 or lower, please upgrade for an important security update!".Reword this. As we know it's not a critical update but a good update. This is very off-putting as it looks very sketchy to new people (insecure network).To me and other hackers (or types that congregate around these sorts of projects), the main page looks fine. Nice, clean, simple. We can see through it to the content. But to most it looks like 1995.The main page should be art-sex. The main page should show that the project is highly active. The main page should hand hold.- Beautiful graphics. Blues are cold colours which are mainly used on business sites to indicate distance/professionalism. A new main page should use yellows/reds/warm colours which come out of the page instead of receding away.- A news feed showing the latest posts. I've written a bot to update forum posts onto a wikipage, but when I tried to port it to the Bitcoin wiki I couldn't find an API for SMF to integrate it with.- Clearly highlighted/focused links which guide you to 1) download bitcoin 2) use it 3) buy bitcoins from a trusted trader 4) find services to use. The current layout is hacker-friendly. Neat sections and find everything for yourself.One idea is possibly to just use the wiki as the main-page,https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_PageThat can be easily be reworked to fit. It's easier to quickly update things to get them working. Lots of content/activity for a new curious user to click through rather than a single dead page.If we could find an API for SMF then I can easily add a forum post section like on,http://poker.bitcoinvegas.com/(See the layout? Left is articles/static info. Right is community/news. Main items are highlighted at the top of the page) 404
A feed of latest posts so I don't have to open 8+ subforums on every visit. Keep the dirty laundry in the open. welcome to earth. ticket valid for 80 years. This a million times over. Been saying this for a while.And the whole "internet is a big place. go somewhere else" argument is false. There is only ONE bitcoin forum, and this is the best place for people to speak (free speech). fuck dat scammer.but keep milking this thread dry for donations. You can't if they're generating a new address per person and a new address at regular intervals. You would only know the funds for one address that is shown to you, and assigned to you.Unless they choose to use one address for their entire account. no. you can only see the coins held by a certain key.you do not know all the keys a wallet holds.and if they use a mixnet anonymiser then they can move funds between keys. You're delusional if you think you'll go from bankrupt to millions. No, I'm looking for the female part.Anyway I messaged a shop and they helped me out. Can someone help me out with this?The central pin in the power jack of my LG P300 laptop is loose and I'm going to solder a new one in.It's a rare prototype with no manufacturers guide and a tiny manual. I couldn't find anywhere selling a spare power jack.What part do I need? I heard it uses standardised parts.Any ideas? Much appreciated (5 BTC) if somebody finds a link indicating where I can buy one in the UK or which other part I can use, or helping me find out how. I'm not sure what to say really. Both arguments are reasonable.Imagine if that wasn't 4 billion play money chips, but $10k of somebody's real-money.While the other side of me says the internet is a game. If you don't like it, then don't play.And once the amounts become too small, it becomes impossible to use the law. Would it be worth going after the person who stole your $5k? In that case then, it's a law for the corporations or rich only. OK, I found someone. What should they say? I would bid on this except you live too far from me.Any ideas how much international would cost? 80 BTC I think the whole point is to allow people to experiment and build their own societies. If you don't like how one place is run then you move to another. Anarcho-communism, libertarian, democratic, ... all of these could be tried on city-size scale.

Yeah I've been stopped 3 times at the airport in the UK by police. They questioned me on every bit of my life each time going back 5 years. All the details and everything with them making notes to file under my name. Not a good thing imo. an erotic story between a 40 year old man and a kidnapped 8 year old whose will becomes broken. when he's eventually caught nothing happens because he's the son of a rich politician. (it's a happy ending) No need to close a thread. Just stop bumping it. If people wish to talk, then let them. He feels like he's protecting society and having a hard day. Then he gets annoyed since you don't want to co-operate.Still, he has no right to bully you into his will.Is there a place where I can see what are the legal boundaries in the UK? Can a policeman detain me and make me miss my flight if I refuse to give my details at the airport? I don't like these growing restrictions. I love these!Would you make a 16x11 bitcoin currency flag/logo for my site? (see currency selection drop lists- bitcoin entry doesn't look so good)http://genjix.freehostia.com/mtux/ Can you put up example stories and say how much you're charging? you could get a lot more for this 0-day vulnerability. you should find a trusted forum member, pay them 30 btc to verify it's real and then put it up in an auction. Instead of examining these long-winded platonic derivatives, look at what happens in practice. Firstly you reason with the child as an equal. If that doesn't work then you set clear reasonable boundaries which can't be crossed. You calmly enforce these non-aggressively.If a child is constantly breaking your rules, then you must have shit rules or too many.You can read some books on child care to inform yourself. Shouting and screaming like a lunatic, making constant demands of your child is a straight path to disobedience and a bad relationship. Whenever a parent loses emotional control they're handing power over to the child by reacting, and rewarding them with a piece of their valuable attention for bad behaviour you don't want to reinforce. An effective parent is one who doesn't need to scream, shout and use violence to submit the child into getting their own (the parent's) way. BTW I think the story is nice. Don't get discouraged. Was offering helpful advice. Going to copy-edit this. Your writing needs more work.I Recommend this:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tony1/How_to_improve_your_writingAlso:http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style.htmlhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articlesYou sometimes sound a bit pretentious by using too many long words and over-expressive language. Instead try to find one strong image/analogy you want to express and write around that.Another thing is you occasionally use words that are excess cruft and are not needed (they can be snipped without losing meaning from the original passages). Excess words = more for reader to digest + take in = takes away from understanding of words that matter = less strong atmosphere = story loses strength.Sat sulking in his agony, anguish accented by a heavily creased brow and a slouched demeanor in the desk chair, X mumbled periodically. X vented regret. Groans and cycles as an old machine past it's glory days, ready to twilight into failure. Buckling pain! His pain threshold was nearly reached.Weaving with convulsions among the kick-knack packets and documents lining his thick mahogany desk, he threw everything in a helter-skelter at the floor in resignation. He sat first in the pitch black, then curled on his side sulking.Emmerich Faultner had invested heavily in the emerging cryptographic-commodity market from the early 2000s. As an early adopter, Faultner accumulated exceptional wealth. Tonight that changed. Crypto-commodities worldwide became worthless at a stroke by the hands of a rogue wolf utilising new consumer-grade quantum-computing. Faultner is one victim of hundreds that had given their entire confidence (and savings) to the recent agorist phenomenon of digital commodities. That text was a bit dense and badly written, but all cognitive research currently shows that restricting the freedom of children and use brute aggression to shape their behaviour is ineffective. But reasoning with children is not feasible either. Parenting methods instead make parents establish firm boundaries and non-aggressively (calmly and unemotionally) enforce them. It's the same with dog teachers- by reacting to their challenge, you are bringing yourself to their level and losing status. Instead you want to quietly and firmly assert yourself. I'm in the process of setting up a UK exchange, so no worries. Fees will be very low.Should be opened within 10-15 days. Ĉu vi rigardis la parton de ĉi tiu forumo por aliaj lingvoj?

Stylistic change but I prefer attaching "takes effort" (some is again fluff) to the first sentence and placing the emphasis on But."To get money takes effort.

The concept we came up with to provide anonymity was:A_x wants to send to B_xA_1 sends 40 BTC to MA_2 sends 10 BTC to MA_3 sends 30 BTC to MSpread over 1 week M does:M sends 10 BTC to B_1M sends 3 BTC to B_2M sends 5 BTC to B_1M sends 6 BTC to B_2M sends 10 BTC to B_3M sends 15 BTC to B_1M sends 5 BTC to B_1M sends 22 BTC to B_3- The sums the mixnet sends never total the sums received. Its +/- a random amount (biased slightly towards - as the fee).- Plausible deniability by spreading the funds over time.- A_x provides several addresses for the B_x destination. M cycles through this list randomly then restarts once it's finished.The only method to reverse engineer payments using this mixnet is through statistical analysis. If the payments are broken down enough, and many different users channel their payments through the system then it's very hard to rationalise what happened from the block-chain. I can do this too:Bicycles = FreedomCars = CommunismFreestyle = FreedomBackstroke = CommunismBrunettes = FreedomBlondes = Communism im sure it's not a problem when 4chan is full of the stuff but govts allow it to run eventhough 'anons' are disruptive thanks for sharing twitter says hes from toms hardware I love dipping dark chocolate for variety having good game is not an excuse to make up for your poor life. it should be supplementary (gaming chicks) fun. sometimes in my life girls becomes an everyday part, and in other times it's not even thought about for a while.so all of this "get a hobby", "learn culture"... you should be doing that anyway to be a well rounded person! not because you think chicks will like you for it- otherwise it's just a false dichotomy.some people care too much about stupid shit (mental baggage) that really they just need to gain emotional freedom & stop worrying. MoneyTree check your private messages. If you're being serious then go to an oil rich developing country like Iran. They have lots of oil to burn for domestic electricity so it costs next to nothing (even poor citizens easily afford it). Energy consumption in Iran is 6.5 times that of global average because people don't give a fuck as it's nearly free.Note how generation exceeds consumption by far,This is a country that does not care about resource-conservation due to over-abundance. Actually that's very slow. If you do choose to accept a central server (that they generate unbiased random numbers) then you can do a distributed shuffle. However you have the problem of one person leaving with their keys when they loose.Then you have the other problem of needing an escrow to hold the funds in the current pot. It's definitely something I want to do in the future to protect against super-users but not a priority right now. virtual machine is a good idea. Thanks will do that.Now I have:- Inside an encrypted virtual machine with only Bitcoin + backup scripts installed (no desktop).- Encrypted wallet.dat on the encrypted drive.- PGP signed backups on servers that use SSH keys + long password.- Firewall blocking all ports except Bitcoin in the virtual machine.Am I missing anything else? Beat that suckers. Shouting until red in the face goes nowhere. Demonstrate by example- live outside the state. Work towards creating a better future. It's bound to happen eventually, what with the advent of the internet and the free software movement. Ne. Uzante neniam, mi ne provis. Mi afiŝis pri Bitcoin al Lernu, tamen neniu interesiĝis... :p new interface,and the old style,If they had more devs then they could work on these features everyone keeps complaining about. Kind of confusing how one of the most important free software projects has so few developers. Unlike Blender which has dozens. These are core-multimedia functionality on Linux!! They're an important pillar that needs fixing. If anyone wants to invest in a bitcoin poker room then I've been working on it.http://poker.bitcoinvegas.comHowever there's lots of side issues that are slowing me down to a crawl. It'd be a definite + to be able to throw money at those issues and breeze through development.Here's community reaction to our project:http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/28/internet-poker/rake-free-open-poker-room-run-poker-community-938389/http://www.liquidpoker.net/poker-forum/940985/Rake-Free__amp;_Ran_By_the_Poker_C...htmlIt'd also be good if I could find a partner to handle all the business/strategy side of development enabling me to focus on technology. My previous partner withdrew after consulting a lawyer to find that running such a company in the US isn't possible (his company is US-based), and would need to be based abroad in one of these gambling tax-free havens like Ireland.One concession I'm willing to make would be licensing all the code under cc-by-nc (prevents commercial use) for 1 year to enable such a business to get a head-start before the code is completely GPL'ed.
How about some solid piece of software that Linux needs desperately.GIMP has 2 guys working on it but they're making a big push now for features- single window interface + lots of other new things. They could really use the cash. (I already donated some BTC to them) Good point. Have monthly pages where people re-add themselves. You should allow people to deposit and have a balance (by IP address) so the gratification of winning is instant.Some people like to bet smaller amounts more (illogical I know).Site is very cool  Thanks for the article. I enjoyed it. BTW those models on that page are rigged/animated... I'll give them to you $25 each if you want them. However their movements are exaggerated and simplistic because they were made for a zoomed out strategy game where the meshes are seen from a far-away distance.But the dragon and the girl have no animation/rigging. Here's some old artworks I've done. These are low-poly so with more polys we could make a quality work,http://genjix.freehostia.com/#artHow does this sound:- Me & my sister create a concept artwork for one of your creatures listed.- You pay $50- If you want to continue, then we make the mesh to completion with everything over a week.- You pay $300Doing all these things you listed is complicated, and it's hard to go back and make changes once you proceed to the next step. Best to get it right the first time- decide on mesh sizes using boxes then on a walkspeed for walk-cycles by measurement. If you later decide to change the mesh then things like UV-unwrapping, skinning, ... will be messed up and need fixing.It's not something like coding where you place a mesh in-game, tweak it, re-export, tweak, ... It's more like here's the constraints (size, various anim speeds, tri-count, texture sizes, ...), make a model fitting those. Then after each step you don't go back (generally). The biggest resistance to Bitcoin I've seen is:- Deflation (we want our currency to lose value).- Mining (baww it's unfair- cry me a river).Did anyone tell inflation-adherents that the rich don't keep hard currency, but put their money in property, stocks, 401ks .etc? I've read all the pro-inflation arguments and they don't make logical sense. The concepts are shady. Yes, I'm buying/selling BTC if available. As a 3D artist that payment is diddly squat for the hours put in to:- Concept draw & research a model.- Model the base mesh.- Optimise the tris for a video game.- UV unwrap a mesh optimally to maximise texture space.- Paint a texture.- Optionally create a bump-map & any other shader textures.- Create an animation rig.- Skin the model.- Create several animations.- Export model to a working in-game format.You haven't thought this through very well... $50 is incredibly optimistic. Thanks for this great project. I'm planning to use this in my next project.thumbs up Damn, this is a project I'd really love to get involved with if I wasn't under so many persistent pressures... Lots of exciting areas to muck around in. i see pics of:- computers- a kid- yourselfwe know what's important to u  linux mint is ubuntu with all the proprietary stuff already installed. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB8_wPei2ZMMy 2 favourite people are James Burke and Carl Sagan.JB is a science historian, and that's the end clip of his series 'The Day The Universe Changed' on the nature of scientific knowledge. It's talking about how eventhough Buddhism is a stagnant inward looking ideology, that it still provides a complete worldview for adherents.It's funny because you watch some of his older series (before the internet existed) and he's already hinting about future advances and things to come. Many of his views have been adopted into the mainstream during recent years.http://www.youtube.com/user/JamesBurkeWebTake a gander at Connections, his most famous series When you insert Ubuntu then you get a live cd desktop (linux running off a the CD- it's a little slow but shows you how it looks).I'd try Kubuntu and Ubuntu livecds and decide which desktop I prefer.When you're ready you hit install. It should guide you through easily (even giving you the automatic option to resize windows and install alongside if you have a windows install, otherwise you can resize it manually if you know how to partition).If you'd like to just run through quickly as a test then you can install VirtualBox and install Ubuntu in a safe environment under Windows.Personally I'd recommend you wipe Windows completely. Install Ubuntu and then install Windows under VirtualBox in Ubuntu for poker or whatever else only. If you're using Windows only for poker then it's going to be very secure. You can even make another windows install under VirtualBox for other apps if you wish to.Also ubuntuforums.org and #ubuntu IRC are good help places. bump Different lines in the sand. Sure I can alias those commands, but why aren't they default?It's like installing a program with no default config. Sure I can RTFM then write a config, but I shouldn't have to.That was the dependency- cairo-xcb, and then it needs oopango-something and oosomething-else iirc, and they both needed additional packages. Too lazy. Ubuntu you just type aptitude install awesome, logout, login and you're done.Rolling releases would be a nice feature but Arch Linux is too ghetto for my liking. like in poker:He thinks that I think that he thinks that I think that he thinks that I think that he thinks that I think that he thinks that I think that he thinks that I think that he thinks that I think that he thinks that I think that he thinks that I think that he thinks that I think that he thinks that I think that he thinks that I think that he thinks I have K9 or find a bunch of other homeless dudes, get a copy of the squatters manual, find an abandoned building (the longer it's been empty, the better), barricade yourselfs in, fix up the place & treat it like your home.people do this all the time. it's not criminal. they can never prove that you've broken in- you normally say the backdoor was already open and you walked in. he probably posts (banter) for real under an alternative nick, and does development under satoshi.
... why would anyone buy porn? internet has too much of it everywhere for free Right now we have a link to a list of traders.It would be a good ideal to have an additional link below labelled 'Buy / Sell'On that page is:a) list of online traders (mtgox, bitcoincash, btcex, ...)b) this map of local cash traders embedded http://www.bitcoinmap.com/ the world is MUCH better than the past. racism, small-town mentality, religion + dogma, work one job til you die, lack of travel, ... the world is going up and up. people are slowly realising what a free society we can build in the future.you see the world through rose tinted nostalgic glasses. the past was horrible. ok so I installed arch linux in virtualbox.first i made 4 partitions then decided i didn't need a /boot one so i went back and deleted it. arch linux didnt recognise i had 3 and kept giving errors so i had to reboot and start over.. everything went fine and effortless.however come first boot up and i try to install awesome window manager. find out i need to MANUALLY download tarballs, unpack them and run:makepkg -s --asrootpacman -U /path/to/package.tar.gzdid that for awesome then it wanted dependency X. downloaded dependency X. it wants dependency Y .etc... I gave up on the 5th dependency... what is the point of a centralised package manager if I'm forced to do this?? why not just have a user repo if you don't want to add some packages to core.and why is it so hard to provide a package for awesome- there's 10 user contributed packages. pacman is also weird as hell to use. why not have:pacman -Qi X  =>   pacman showinfo Xpacman -Sy   =>   pacman updatepacman -Ss X  => pacman search Xwhy these people always have to contrive things? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcbaeKA2moEhurrah I was trying to be polite and friendly, but you lashed out aggressively. You do this because you feel frustrated (your aggressive tone) and you care more than I do (hence your multiple long replies). Not sure why you're attacking me when I was trying to mediate. If you had a clear winning point then you wouldn't feel the need to attack others (calling me a kid) or defend yourself.And yes, you don't get to pick and choose what you censor. Censorship is restricting free speech. Don't try to twist it any other way than you don't like the speech that you're reading and so want to impose your force onto others.I've called you out. Any further response from you (to what I've said here) shows you're invested in this convo more than I am (I don't care enough to post further in this thread). cya Why not rename the bitcoin to the spesmilo? Move this site to http://spesmilo.org (the domain is free). Start referring to 10 Sm instead of 10 BTC. I see a lot of talk about finding a unicode currency symbol for BTC and so on.Has anyone thought about just adopting the Spesmilo for Bitcoin?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpesmiloBitcoin could be THE new spesmilo.There's also the Stelo which was a revival attempt of the Spesmilo,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SteloBitcoin would then get automatic promotion from Esperanto speakers/community too. excuses. They rarely bother you if you're quiet:http://squattheplanet.com/diy-die/squatting-alternative-housing/post there and askIt's the same in the UK. Breaking and entering is illegal, but they can never prove it. You claim the window was open or the door left ajar. ok, that sounds great How are kernel updates/drivers managed? Are they automatic like on Ubuntu? OK, I keep hearing about Arch Linux and I'm **this** close to wiping my hard-drive and installing it. The terminal is my mandala, and I'm wabi-sabi with it. BUT (and this may sound churlish) everytime I open the Arch Linux website and see the install page, I'm reminded of my gentoo days. Then I click close after muttering "ugh".Rolling updates is a big plus. However I want my system to work. Work out the box and stay out of my way. I don't like pissing away my precious days configuring my box and kernel flags (like I did years and years ago)... Honestly: how unstable/non-automated is the system? I don't like spending hours configuring upgrades. I've got my delicate balance of vim/irssi/mutt/bash/desktop/whatever configs that I get thrown off if they need fixing (like Ubuntu when we have major breaking releases rather than small incremental rolling updates  ).Please advise. damn... I also remember waiting a week to download a movie off Kazaa and 2 days off a warez site... How times have changed... Bullshit.http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2005/08/19/17608451.phpI gave you 4 links already saying the opposite. I know people that squat in the USA. It most definitely is not criminal. I suggest you research it as there's no excuse for you not to squat.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting#United_States_of_AmericaContact this infocentre: http://squat.net/Ask on these forums: http://www.squattheplanet.com/ why? sounds like a very good idea  If it got on the news then people would look up bitcoin oh fuck that. Thanks for the info. Saved me a massive headache.How retarded. Ubuntu or Kubuntu (try both livecds, see which desktop you prefer and then install from livecd). Did I miss the year of the Linux desktop? What can I do? The whole point of couchsurfing is that you setup a profile and dialog with people. It's not a free hotel service in people's houses where I can just go online, find him a bed and paste here for him to turn up 7pm tomorrow. He has to arrange it himself with the guests & establish trust, especially since I'm on the other side of the planet.I did a quick search of Denver and found 1300 people, 529 offering places for the night.There's this group he can post in:http://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=3750Additionally as I said before, you should find squatters and anarchists to crash with. If I was homeless tomorrow, I'd break into an abandoned building rather than blowing my cash on cheap crappy hotels. I'd pay a small motel $5 or so just to wash everyday and look presentable. If it does, how will they react? Send me a formal notice asking me to cease operations, or seize all my funds?
Hey,Lighten up a little.This sounds very authoritarian. Just ignore a thread if you don't like it. Don't try limit others free speech. It's not easy to take you soapbox elsewhere as this forum is the major bitcoin conduit. bitcoinmap.com < have you heard of them? No. Only if this becomes popular and I need that. Hey,I'd like to setup a UK <-> BTC exchange. I figure the easiest way is to do this manually so I opened a new account with Nationwide.I'd have a simple gmail where people notify me they've sent me £X or Y BTC, then I reply back with the offer and the accept it or not.My internet banking allows me to download a .CSV file which I can write a simple Python script to parse and then alert me when I've received the funds. Then I can send them the equivalent BTC.And for BTC -> £GBP, when funds are received, I login to my internet banking and send them the funds.Is this fine? Will my bank shut down my account- I don't want people to lose their funds because of my banking inexperience. ok you do realise that changing my name costs $60? Then I have to get my lazy ass out. Then I have to request new documents, bank accounts, ... There's a reason I put 2k btc in the title :p I'm serious and will use this name. when does the auction end?1 BTC +3 FreeMoney - done a few trades with him so far for varying amounts. ^ haha I like the above idea!About my real name- is it needed? Anyone that wishes to know can PM me, however it's not best to put it here as googling it finds out a ton of info about me. It's a pretty shitty name- religious and ugly. Make your pledges here:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2655.0 Current idea:Bitcoin GenjixI will do a legal name change and use it in everyday life. Will present proof here after completion (bank cards, documents .etc).Open to other suggestions. Not really too attached to my name. that's an awesome domain. sell it on the marketplace. best of luck man :] nice to hear your story. Hey,Can you setup CIA for your branch?Click Admin on the github project page.Then click Service Hooks.Click CIA in the listCheck [X] ActiveNow go to http://cia.vc and create an account.Create a new repository and enter the info (for website URL write https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git)Click Bots, Add bot and choose an IRC channel.It should work now. Everytime you push to your repo then #bitcoin-dev will get a commit summary + url to a diff for review.We can all know what's going on. +1 another reason to remove the wxWidgets code from Bitcoin and allow others to make their own. Endi neestas esperantan vorton  Vi intencis diri ĉesi.Ankaŭ mi provis uzbl, kvankam ĝi ne funkciis bone por mi  kaj malfacile (kontraŭ bona uzeco, ekzemple kopado de la TTTadreso ne funkciis). ok well im selling prostitution. check out my thread (had to be done) Selling myself.

Mi uzas Midori por TTT-legilo. Rimarkinte en alia fadeno ke vi uzas Arora, mi provis ĝin.Provu Mirdori! Ĝi estas pli rapide ol Arora. Kaj mi ŝanĝis ĝin al miaj preferoj (sen menubaro .ktp)... La tempo por malfermado estas ekrapida!hmmm, antaŭ ĉi tiam mi uzis multajn softvarojn de KDE... nun mi uzas pli da pli de GTK-softvaroj...WebKit estas tre fantazia. Nun ni vidos multajn TTTlegilojn ĉar la plej malfacila parto de TTTlegilo, la HTML-reproduktanto, fariĝis. Do ni vidos multajn TTTlegilojn por ĉiu da ĉiuj preferoj! Tio estas la metodo de libera softvaro!! Good job if you've opened the source, but what the hell? Where is it?Can you put it on git (upload to github?) so we start forking it?jgarzik- you're the best. I've seen you making lots of donations around here and helping build the bitcoin economy. Good job. yep. It's a bit weird, isn't it? Methinks they want to hide the easiest way of donating  I'll mention that 95% of this forum are libertarians. Take all political posts with the biases of the writers.Far more important than everything in that video (Bitcoin included), is free software. The web is a product of it. Future ramifications are huge. Think of something like the reprap easily available to all.Mention Esperanto. The whole thing was dying, but since the advent of the internet it's been showing sharp growth. There's a chance yet for a global neutral easy-to-use expressive lingua franca.Nowhere was crowd-sourcing to be found. First we had the industrial age. After the electronic age. We are now in the information age. The biggest impact of free access to information is self-reliance, independent of ruling masters. We can function in informal communities.It is too narrow focused on environment issues. The environment matters, but not too the exclusion of every connected issue of this modern age. It feels as though the documentary fails to place it within context of a bigger picture.As an aside (separate from above), you could mention the possibility of Mars missions. Missions that would place men on Mars for 6 months using landers that make use of local resources (NASA plans this for mid 2030s). Subsequent missions plan to place men there for longer periods each time extending by 6 months. The reason for going to Mars is eventual human habitation which is a definite possibility. Mars holds many valuable resources and would be a boon to Earth economy. Remaining on Earth running our resources dry condemns us to a rascist future where economy is a zero sum game in which we see our neighbouring races as competitors for dwindling resources. Should we go to Mars, we would be prosperous and trading in the currency of ideas not valuables. OK it's on the webpage. Scroll down to Donate and it has his address so you can donate to it http://awesome.naquadah.org/community/ pfffft people with no references are the coolest in my experience imo. people are too paranoid of getting raped in todays safe world https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet#Linux_solution No. It was unlicensed, and belongs to jgarzik now. His decision whether to release it or not. I'd hope he would. yeah please use metric SI prefixes. That coin is a very cool momento. You should consider selling that merchandise.Real bitcoin currency though would just be hard-to-manufacture paper notes with a barcode that has an address with 1 BTC in. http://awesome.naquadah.org/^ they take bitcoin donations now. Guy said he'll add it to his front page soon. ocremix.com <- support them hoarding? I've made ~600 BTC doing various things around the forum. And bought ~2500 O_O no it's not. Inside is very messy. The code was originally free, but jgarzik asked me to close the repo when I transferred it over. no the problem is that i have no idea wtf something like this even looks like.if someone makes a mockup then i'll start doing the graphic design for the page and helping out with coding.If someone wants to make a git project this week and after post their repo here so I can fetch it.Please make it with modularisation in mind. That is all.Is it really too hard to make some rough documents? Won't even take a day for someone in the know. But whatever... prototype code is a longer form but basically the same. cool. added that to the front page of the wiki. fabianhjr what's you CS?mine: http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/genjixsurf me if im ever hosting. drm is in the linux kernel. the difference is you switch it on or off. http://www.liquidpoker.net/poker-forum/944109/poor_guy_needs_help.htmlnot much sympathy for you there...you and your friend should both search couchsurfing for a bed. loads of people don't mind hosting there. but you must ask for 2 nights ONLY and then gtfo after those 2 nights.i cant comment on craigslist or work... never really done those types of things (always had coding opportunities). although i've bummed it for fun a lot and don't agree with your assertion that sleeping rough is a full time job. Just go to a public toilet and wash under your armpits and face- then you won't smell like a stinky bum. Keep stuff in your locker (nice clothes for work) and wear one set of bummy (scavenged?) clothing. Seek out other cool people- hackers, anarchists, punks, squatters... you'll be fine around them since you're a programmer and they like those types. After Apache 1, instead of jumping into coding Apache they spent more than a year documenting how they should think it looks. Then with Apache 2 they had an exact idea what to make and it was a true community effort.codeswarm apache visualisation:http://www.vimeo.com/1076588Python does the same with the PSEPs.Remember the python zen:Now is better than never.Although never is often better than *right* now.Free software projects are really excellent when they have to code programs where it's clear what the function is. But when there's no framework or beginning idea in place then it's more a hackfest. That's why much of the best free software projects are opened-up former closed projects (firefox, blender, openoffice, qt, ...)- because now it's clear to everyone which direction the project has to go and the swarm can iterate to perfection.I have no idea what an exchange site looks like. But having a spec and some screenshot mockups would make it super easy for everyone to contribute a few modules and quickly get such a site done. It's something everyone wants and I'm sure everyone will chip in a small amount of time to maintain their own modules (it's not even a hard thing to code- probably).We aren't talking about a huge 1000 page documentation bible but maybe 10 pages or so saying screen X does this, blaa blaa.
hear hear. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFkgSjRnay4learnt git in an hour from that video. Instead of pledging small bounties for what is an important project, it might be a good idea if we setup a page on the wiki and begin documenting how such a site should look/function.Making this site is piss easy. It's the spec that's hard.Then after we can make a git repo and begin coding.I have no idea how such a thing would function. But with a clear document with simplistic drawings i'm confident we could easily do this in a week or less.How about pledging the money not for the software (which is likely to be some weekend shoddy hackjob which isn't maintained) but for a comprehensive design spec detailing exactly what each page of the site does, how the API looks, how the tech works .etcSuch a thing on the wiki can then be easily discussed/maintained by others.1- I pledge to help with designing the look or coding. i scored about the same as you except my harm is double yours.edit: that test is utter crap. i tried a different test there and got totally different results. Maybe you should donate to our project instead http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/28/internet-poker/rake-free-open-poker-room-run-poker-community-938389/http://www.liquidpoker.net/poker-forum/940985/Rake-Free__amp;_Ran_By_the_Poker_Community_.htmlhttp://poker.bitcoinvegas.com/The software is free so you'd be able to host your own room.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqwvVPfarP4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdK65mGbiyM What are the specifications for this kind of thing? Doesn't seem hard to create the software.Maybe there should be a site for people to register as escrows that allow people to do exchanges. Kind of like the facebook of mtgox's.I'd be willing to write this (should be easy) and put the code out there. Could even be hosted by MagicalTux (he's willing).When each person registers, the server generates them a random string ID which is used for their accounts. They can then choose to trade with someone using any escrow of their choosing.However, how would you hook-up your own native currency? Is the format too restrictive? Maybe it's just better to provide exchange software and let others use it. Do you live near Shandong province? If so maybe we can work out something... PM me. He posted them:1F5KnfiGkHL7icJ7LGBtrYsp8NwXKqsMDj and my paypal is skostemart@gmail.comIf he gives direct bank deposit then people can wire money to his bank.And also people might know people close by who can help him out in minor ways (food, temporary shelter) Are you able to give a picture of your face holding a piece of paper with the date saying 'HeLLo B1tcoiners'?I'm asking some other people and want to prove you're legit (since we have the dated photo of you from myspace). i swore to boycott paypal, but im making an exception here. Have donated $46... unable to donate more because hard for me to xfer money as i dont use banks  hopefully others will help make up the other $100 you need. Fuck the hotel. You will need that money. Go find a public toilet and lock the doors. Go to the newspaper bank and grab lots of cardboard/paper to put in bunches under your clothes to keep you warm.Another option is to climb some roofs if your city is a dense urban area. Find a warm enclave.Put your shit in lockers. You don't want to get mugged. Stay off the drink.You don't need a tent if you're in the city. start contacting environmentalists and communist/anarchist websites. ask for helping hand. do not ask for money but say you need help or work.better in those places than this libertarian haven.start giving people proof. many people here are skeptical. you need to convince them. photos, anything...also how can people help you?- work? (what are your skills)- shelter? (how long?)- money? (how much/how to pay you?)Go to http://www.couchsurfing.org/ , start posting in the North America group like crazy,http://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=277Asking for money off the bat is a BAD IDEA. Ask for help in other ways. If people want to donate then they'll find ways to ask you. Hearing a call for money is an instant turn-off for most.Really 7 months was a long time to leave this until it got desperate. can you post some details? i'll try to show some americans and see if they can deposit. If you was in the UK I would try to put you up... help you out  Sadly it's not possible cos you're in the USA.If someone agrees to let you stay then take that as a blessing and work your ass off to get up and running ASAP! Don't be a bummy leecher until they kick you out/get pissed @ you!and stay away from that ex! she sounds like a massive failure. OK, I can offer advice having roughed it during travels:Firstly you should not have let it progress to this point. You left things far too long to degenerate without taking action. Now you're in the shit. It's far harder to keep yourself afloat when your head is below water.Find a place to sleep. At night you can go inside a public toilet and lock the door. Use the sinks to wash under your arms and your face as you don't want to stink. Another good place is buying a train ticket- it's a good too for travel as you sleep and wake-up in a new city (work?).See also this guy,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_gardnerStart looking for squatters. Squats aren't junky places like you often see in the movies but many of them are quite nice- maybe slightly political with anarchist leanings. Explain your situation and ask for shelter.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squattinghttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvXB8-AGCwEFor food do the freeganism thing. You can go to markets at the weekend and ask for their refuse food- food that's a little past the sell-by date but is otherwise fine. Also the big supermarkets like to put lots of food (still wrapped and mostly fine) in the dumpsters. Lookup dumpster diving for more info. One easy thing is just going into a restaurant (think MacDonalds) and eating people's leftover meals- it's not that bad as you image because people are people just like you and me. Often people actually leave quite a lot of leftovers and you can get a good meal.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpster_divinghttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeganismAccept your situation. No one is going to help. You have to seize action. Unfortunate but true. Sadly the scammers have made life tough for genuine people.... There's lots of ways to live free (I've done it)... Will post more as I remember tips.You action plan should be:- Find immediate place to sleep (public toilet, overnight train)- Dumpster dive, ask small shops/markets for refuse food & seek out free food.- Get work ASAP- Search squats to stay at.- Take control.- STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM DEGENERATE FUCKUPS. They will only ruin everything and cause you massive hassles.good luck. You want people to invest time or money when you don't know any Japanese artists, are unsure of the market, no alpha software/site to show, no roadmap to follow and a highly specific plan for a market in which BTC uptake is low. Are readers of manga rich?Not attacking you, just telling you how I see it. Doesn't look like a winner. Having been collaborating on free software for 9 years, having used CVS and then SVN... I can attest they're an affront to good development. git is smooth chocolate. MadHatter's new sex shop should be generating unique addresses per user every few days. - Statement.- Statement.- Statement.You need to backup your claims. Much of what I said is common psychology:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_techniquehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(Psychology)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-ballhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proofThe Chinese situation is a commonly raised example of these techniques in action. Cars are retarded anyway. Suburbanism = urban sprawl = a disease. New urbanism ftw. + pay tons in costs and pollute the environment burning precious fossil fuels to move 1 person for a 30 minute walk.Are we building cities for cars or for people? Support pedestrianism.
we dont want to see your flat chestdo u have skills... if so do something and make the economy grow You need to avoid getting into confrontational situations altogether. Don't challenge people's assertions but compliment their ideas and work them into the argument. Get them to comply voluntarily with your POV.Funnily the same thing happens with Esperanto. Read this article,http://claudepiron.free.fr/articlesenanglais/reactions.htmClaude Piron details why it happens and how best to counteract that knee-jerk response of something alien or different.You won't win over people by refuting all their points and destroying their argument. You win over people by tactical persuasion and gentle massaging through small steps to your POV.In the NK-war, Chinese successfully on a wide scale were able to get American POWs to denounce their own governments and write long essays on the ills of capitalism. They did this by establishing small voluntary compliance tests for the POWs to reach. Because the soldiers weren't forced towards these small tests and passed them voluntarily, the person sees it as part of their self-image. You rework their self-image to fit the behaviour desired. One method used was holding 'competitions' for the best essay on capitalism- sometimes pro-capitalist essays won but more generally it was the anti-capitalism ones. Slowly soldiers would begin to bias towards anti-capitalism and so would their peers (social proofing). Each time the Chinese would then raise the bar, until they had soldiers shouting down the mic at other Americans on the front-line extorting the wonders of communism and the ills of capitalism (voluntarily).This was not a few odd cases, but a widespread successful attempt. gpg is standard. everyone uses it. There are equal numbers of men and women -_-If equal numbers of women match an all male figure, that place doubles in size.It grows from 100% -> 200%, by a growth of 100% All of 2 BTC. Don't spend it all at once. bober didn't do anything wrong. If anyone should get the blame, then it's me for selling a faulty service. Hey, if he found a security flaw and used it for fun and profit then more power to him!Someone has to find the security holes so that we can patch them  And so the software gets better. That's not the point. Did you watch the video? I'll post it again,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCjDxAwfXV0Hopefully everyone will realise why such jokes (ho ho ho) are not the minor humour that they seem. Also there are women hanging around in all sorts of these communities, but they don't openly display it and stay away from threads like this. s/women/(black people|gingers|chinese)/ and see how intimidating it sounds. Your comments are not so innocent as you think,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCjDxAwfXV0Having seen that video, you won't attribute blacks doing poorly due to their race.I'm no walking vagina and even think women have too many rights (automatically gain child in divorce, free paycheck, can't hit a lady, ...). BUT my sister is a physics major (not because of me, but because of Carl Sagan) and she tells me that other girls ridicule her for being clever. She's not weird or ugly, just highly educated. That's out of place. Girls comment to her why she knows all this esoteric knowledge as though it's a bad thing. Whereas I grew up being respected as a genius by peers.So HUR HUR HUR get back to the kitchen = you're being an asshole.Don't do it. hey why you guys haven't attacked iranian people too? im starting to feel you guys are a bit rascist. thx lol. whatever you say. We need a worldwide map where traders can add themselves. > everyone should have the right to start an ISP....How could that work??? HHAHAHA who uploaded that asian chick with that quote. Hilarious. "We're sorry, but something went wrong.We've been notified about this issue and we'll take a look at it shortly."-_- Yeah bounce around new entries in the network. It's not hard. Same. Will do any stakes. But not too low or that's boring. Ok, not worth it. Takes me a few days to write a quality article. First 10 (or until I decide ) artworks I choose are free. Will start with black and white sketches. Mostly I prefer people, animals and dinosaurs.Make your requests. I will do my favourite ones and post them here.Bad request:do satoshi lolGood request:Make a picture of Satoshi as a Japanese cross-dressing man trying on girls tights. He's sitting on a small stool feeling his outstretched shins wearing a tutu, no top and a bowl cut.Go!
Would you pay me for an article?If you're interested here's some of my writings,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GenjixBest one is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Genjix/Free_SoftwareAs you can see I've been meaning to do a Bitcoin article already. Most of my writings are anarchist/left/free market.Here's another recent article I wrote:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2361.0(ED article on Bitcoin)My edits to Bitcoin Wikipedia article which helped satisfy the criteria and get it out of incubator status:From (old version): http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Article_Incubator/Bitcoin&oldid=401594747To (my updates): http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bitcoin&oldid=401922676Another article that took me several days,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_squatting_banSome older writings:https://n-1.cc/pg/blog/openid_44398/read/44422/jbhttps://n-1.cc/pg/blog/openid_44398/read/44572/bayesian-securityI'd really enjoy to write one of these articles for 200-400 BTC depending on the length/quality needed. And I'm not worried what license is used. Seems like Creative Username has a vendetta against the article (see the header),http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Bitcoin thanks for the extra 20 btc- nice surprise! didn't really expect that *gratitude* *bows*Really nice of you! seriously. Didn't have to do that. heh, well I'm not sure if you realise how much effort goes into writing. That was my 4th draft + uploading images and fighting with the admin... Read the quote I was quoting. It was the person saying whether $400 isn't enough. Hint: it isn't, unless you want to do it & the $400 is a bonus. This is a perfectly doable task but would take quite a while to do to perfection (which personally if I'm taking people's money then I do want to).  ok enough of that.

Firstly you guys might want to check out our project:http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/28/internet-poker/rake-free-open-poker-room-run-poker-community-938389/http://poker.bitcoinvegas.com/wikiSecondly, just because you don't yet know the applications of Bitcoin, doesn't mean they don't exist. Very clever things we never thought of are going to spring up. New ways of doing things.It makes me feel so good that I made 500 BTC worth of my bitcoins in a diversified way- a) played poker b) donations for bringing that Wikipedia article out of the incubator c) hacking up a website over 1 weekend and selling it d) trading currency. It's not much money, but it is a very cool feeling.If bitcoin takes off then there will be a new economy of workers on the internet; people selling artwork, people receiving donations for editing wikipedia, coders getting micropayments...... A new cultural revival  That thing is incredible. Something like from terminator.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9ByGQGiVMghttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5JHMpLIqO4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHJJQ0zNNOMhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhj3Z9o6t0ghttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jyBiECoS3Qhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCLBG9KeX4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKPVQal851UFuture is here guys.

I could do the same for here but I couldn't find an API for swf. I think you should offer your services for free to build a portfolio where your work is being used somewhere. As it stands now, those sketches won't fly. Another tip is that 5 of your best quality artworks showing a variety of styles is much more impressionable lots and lots of mediocre work.And that license- retaining control over a work on my website? Forget it.Not trying to be harsh, but I don't see any finished quality works. Just a bunch of sketches and lots of badly coloured drawings. If you want to get into graphics design, then I suggest trying to make functional works in a vector program and go from there. If you wish to do fine art, then read Andrew Loomis books on figure drawing. Can you please rename Wiki to Help?I know for us it's easy to understand. But other's may not understand that it's the Bitcoin documentation.Anyway, check out my guide https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Getting_started if you want to know which then google "what is my ip", and go to the google maps link. scroll down for your ip address. Ni afiŝu ĉi tie ke tiu havas plej afiŝojn   Could toaddresss be destination instead? I don't think having an object for toaddress is ugly- fine by me. It's just nit-picking. A lot less worse than the inconsistent naming scheme used.... (grumbles back to basement).Code:"toaddress" : { "address" : amount }"address" "address" is redundant.Code:"destination" : { "address" : amount }Now my code will read:transaction["destination"]["address"]Which reads exactly like the English:transaction destination addressClear, simple and logical.However is category really that necessary? Amount is already + or -. Or is move also in there too?BTW I don't see any addresses in that output you pasted. That's perfect.  sorry someone just snapped them up.I'll be getting more though soon, so PM me and I'll have your name to keep you posted.cya what's the correlation between that graph and the equation you worked out? not sure how to do it for quadratic curves..

I don't mind to make a patch if needed- this should be a trivial change. Just deprecate the old functions for the new.EDIT: ooops mods can you move this to Development? I made an error. Hey,getaccountaddress <account> -> getaddress [account]getnewaddress -> newaddresssendtoaddress -> sendI think that the get prefix should only be used for getting existing information. Things like making a new address are an action.These changes will make the API more logical and easier to use. Especially for someone like me who uses bitcoind over SSH and on my local machine also.sendtoaddress <- the to address part is redundant. Where else would you send it to? (i know IP's are possible but aren't they not recommended/being fazed out?)getnewaddress <- You have to make a new address before returning it. Therefore you're not 'getting' something that already exists but performing an action.getaddress should have account be optional. Have the ability to just return an address from the default account "". Nothing. I just leave it running. MTux has kindly donated the resources to me needed.Note: you'll need to write a script to delete old files. Shouldn't be hard but I didn't get around to doing it yet as there's plenty of filespace available. Strange, mi ĵus rimarkis ke la Esperant-literoj malaperas: ĉŭŝĵĥ ĈĤĴŬŜ kiam vi citis min.

Softvaro = programarohttp://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programaro Do you accept PokerStars$? If so, PM me and I'll instantly do this. How is that possible? The site has to confirm the payments were received first before it's possible to download the file.Your other suggestions were all good, and I've updated the site now. A file for 2 BTC costs 2 BTC.

This is great. It's also really weird and odd looking.I had 5 messages and never realised until just now. It's not very obvious. It's be nice to have a plain blue banner at the top like you get on Wikipedia with new messages, not some obnoxious flashing red text though. Why does IsStandard block this? It's a great idea. If a wallet requires the keys of several people then it's possible to have distributed security instead of placing your trust in one source. Al la alia afiŝulo supre: la softvaro je la ĉefpaĝo funkcias por mi. Se ĝi ne funkcias por vi, vi provu kompili de fonto per la komando:make -f makefile.unix bitcoindPoste vi funkcigu ĝin per './bitcoind' kaj './bitcoind help'Vi akiros la Blok-Ĉenon de la samtavola reto. Tio okazos iam post bitcoind komencos. You exchange currency or vouchers for BTC which you spend freely at the shops.Some trader agrees to redeem these vouchers./thread What I'm asking though, is that with this scheme you're trusting ONE person.The one person who re-assembles the wallet and does the transaction.What if he sent all the funds to himself?How can we have all 8 nodes together confirm to send BTC with each other's consent? I saw your title and felt sick... And if one node that has the reconstructed wallet goes rogue and decides to send all the money to themselves- there's nothing you can do.
Hey,I'm writing a proposal and talking about security. So far my weak point is that one computer holds all the Bitcoins.Is there a way to have an online wallet spread over 8 computers and requiring confirmation from all 8 parties to carry out a command?The closest idea I got was using GPG to encrypt different parts of the wallet and then one node reconstructs the wallet, does the command and re-splits it up amongst the other nodes. I couldn't get Mac OS to run in VirtualBox so I don't know about that.But I run Linux so of course it will be multiplatform http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/28/internet-poker/rake-free-open-poker-room-run-poker-community-938389/index11.html#post23524794Lots of interest on the 2+2 forums about this project. About WSEX, check out my essay I wrote:http://www.kartludox.org/index.php?title=Rake-free_PokerWe hope to cover this as on of the agendas at the meeting:http://www.kartludox.org/index.php?title=Dec_16_2010_-_Public_Forum(See 3rd point)Interesting debate about Bitcoin raging on 2+2:http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/28/internet-poker/rake-free-open-poker-room-run-poker-community-938389/Would be nice to have some Bitcoin-FUD-fighters. article is back now.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcointhanks to everyone that took part  pat on our backs. Good point, I didn't realise that- thanks for the tip. I meant it in the way that all Poker sites charge the same rake. You have the choice to either play or not play. Hey,I'll keep this short but I know some of you are interested in Poker. We're a group writing Poker software and this might interest some of you. It's the text we spammed to various Poker websites.------Everyday 200k play on PokerStars. After the day's end, PokerStars has netted a nice $1.34 million. They give themselves a nice pat on the back while the players have been exploited. Running a Poker site is not a high-cost expense.Rake distorts the games. Without rake, a losing player might be breakeven, a breakeven player a solid winner and a winner is a MASSIVE winner. People move up faster leading to more fish at higher stakes benefiting the whole Poker economy.Even with the huge sums taken out of the games by the sites, they still offer shoddy service in return. PokerStars gives you a couple of TV tournaments and a piecemeal updates to their software. Cake Poker gives you atrociously bad security; any programmer can tell you how easy it is to secure your software using programming that is free on the net.We're proposing a community run Poker room. The software will be completely free/open so anyone can inspect it to make improvements. Because eyes of the whole Poker community will be fixed on it, flaws & security problems very quickly disappear. And if you wish to make your own Poker room then you can! As the server code is also free & open.We've been working on this rake-free Poker room. For those interested there is an online meeting between Poker players at 22:00 GMT (5PM EST) on Thursday Dec 16th in #pokerface on Freenode. For anyone not familiar with IRC you can join the chatroom here:http://pastecoin.com/cgi-bin/irc.cgiIf you're interested in this project but won't be able to make the meeting, don't worry about it. The meeting will be logged and posted on the wiki. Even if you're not a developer we need regular poker players to tell us what they want so please attend and voice your thoughts.See you there!--- some screenshots of our work so far ---- Hey,As you know Wikileaks has been finding it very hard to get funding. Here's an idea:Bitcoin transactions are basically free. That means funds can be bounced around the world many times without any problems.Let's say person A wants to donate to Wikileaks. They go to our site and request to donate. We have lots of trusted people for different countries who will accept the funds into their bank account. Then each person holder trades their cash for BTC (eCardOne for  or £ -> $ Liberty Reserve -> mtgox $ -> BTC).Next the BTC is funnelled through a money laundering service which is simultaneously taking many donations which goes through a tor service. The laundering service sends random amounts throughout an extended period which obfuscates the money trail for authorities to pick up.Lastly we say to Wikileaks how much $ we're holding. Whenever they request funds, we simply sell BTC on a German exchange direct to their account.For securing the funds, it's easy enough to just encrypt the wallet regularly using gpg and upload to an ssh server. Since Bitcoin doesn't require being online to receive funds then the gpg keys can be kept in a locked safe inside a bank on a USB thumbdrive, while the encrypted wallet is subdivided and uploaded to several redundant servers.I think this donation system is unbeatable from a government point of view. It requires a network of volunteers to liquidise assets and then one or more _trusted_ points (shared by several people) that authorise funds to Wikileaks. Unlikely since other sources don't go into as much technical depth as do the forums. Sadly I use GBP and eCardOne charges 8%, Liberty Reserve charges 2% and mtgox charges 1% = 11% lost.BTW Thanks so much for the donations! Very nice surprise to have gotten  ok, I've been trying to fix up this Wikipedia article since the writing in most places is very bad. Here's some tips for other editors:- Do not put sources in the middle of sentences. They go on the end otherwise it makes reading very difficult and breaks up the flow.- Paragraphs should not be too thick, nor too thin. Too thick = wall of text. Too thin = jumpy interrupted reading.- Therefore, however, also <- useless fluff. Unencyclopedic 'filler' words- Some organisations (who?), ... Some (who?)... After an amount of time (when?)... A number of traders (which?)... Be highly specific and exact with your wording. Better to list the exact traders or exact number; five traders do X.- "and use the Bitcoin software to trade bitcoin money" <-- I think it's clear that Bitcoin is software and that it's trades money which are called bitcoins. Better would be "and use Bitcoin to trade."- OH WOW ZOMG LOOK IT HAS ALL THESE FEaTURES. don't do that either. state facts.kk get cracking. Hey,Lot's of people from 4chan using the tool Loic with the channel thealps.anonops-irc.com #loic or the command 'sudo hping3 api.paypal.com -p 443 -S -i u3000 -q' have managed to take down all these sites!This is illegal and wrong. I understand people have different views on Wikileaks but taking illegal action is not the correct path. Better to voice yourself through the correct legal channels and signing petitions.Amazing how easy it is to get these tools:http://encyclopediadramatica.com/LOIC#Downloadit even runs in wine.Hope the good boys (police) catch these criminal hackers soon.Peace. http://bitcoinwatch.com/ - $900k economy.bunch of people on youtube accepting them like http://www.youtube.com/user/stefbothttp://www.bitcoin.org/tradehttps://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AoZuext-s46CdHp2YmlXWkxMd0FzbloyMUcwZVdET1E&hl=en&gid=2 #bitcoin IMO. Talk to people on #freenode and they'll be able to get you setup.when i first heard of bitcoin I insta-joined #bitcoin and saw hardly anyone there/ it's only through luck that i found the -dev channel.otherwise i might've thought this was a dead project gavin suggested and I've confirmed there's a problem with this where if you do:bitcoind move "OldAccount" "NewAccount" 10Where NewAccount has never received any BTC before, then it doesn't work. Surely since the WalletTx are added sequentially to the wallet, we can assume that older txid's appear earlier in the wallet?Then it's simply trivial to do a linear lookup and then continue on spitting out the txid's after that one.Can anyone confirm this? logical. yes. Hey,Is the limitation of 8 decimal places a protocol one or a client one? If so, why?I know that 8 decimal places is MASSIVE, but I'm just wondering why since it's inexpensive to have 16 decimals. ah this does the trick. Still a listaccounts JSON method is a good patch to have. ah great. See attached.(add .diff please to attach forum filter http://pastecoin.com/uploads/rpcdiff
ok I've made a fix for this anyway which I'm submitting. except it uses wx 2.9 and ubuntu only has 2.8. And I don't want to try to manually compile wx (dependency hell)...Is there not just a way to get a list of my accounts using bitcoind?I also need it for hosted services where I login using ssh. So I'm unable to use the graphical client as I'm using the SVN.I have 20 btc somewhere belonging to an account I don't know. How can I get a list of all the accounts in my wallet?Is there a way to send X just from all accounts? I'm buying 2272 BTC for $500 PokerStars (@ $0.22/BTC). Trusted members only. Trade in parts.FreeMoney: are you selling? If so then PM me on IRC. Eh! Ĉiuj ne serioze uzas komputilojn kiel ni!

Bitcoin is for moneyA lot of us are investing considerable time, money and energy into Bitcoin related services. There's talk on these forums of embedding DNS, files, ... food  Bitcoin should focus on money. By including all these extras in here, you will scare off others. Focus on one thing and do it well. I don't want the code-base to become bloated/be debased with all these extras that may not work and just use up our energy.We have something that works. Lets try to protect the parade.However, having said that: if there is some way to generalise Bitcoin so that anyone can setup services with no preference, then that can only be a good thing that'll strengthen the network. I'm against though including specific things in the main codebase. http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=more_faqs#uncatagorizedcheck the FAQ Don't do this as it would fix a bullseye on the Bitcoin community. We'd be under intense heat and pressure.We need to quietly build our infrastructure and expand. Sure a government can't shut down the network itself, but they can close exchanges and that would devalue Bitcoins into nothing. There's lots of ways to attack the Bitcoin currency without touching the tech. I've also added preview and a public API to compete with bencoderhttp://pastecoin.com/Just upload and the download link has it automatically. Hey,Is this correct? Does my wallet save every single address? Pledging 1 BTC. Hey,I've made a new site, http://pastecoin.com/ *plug*Anyway here's my idea:On Christmas eve & Christmas day I will set the charges on that site to 0. Before then we all make something related to Bitcoin (music, poetry, picture, anything) and post the direct download link here, together with the paid download link.Then on Christmas eve/day everyone will go and pay 1 BTC to the posted content they liked the most (except their own).- People post files.- Others check them out.- Everyone pays 1 BTC to their favourite download on Christmas.Example:http://pastecoin.com/uploads/cairo.jpghttp://pastecoin.com/download.php?file=1(You can set more than 1 BTC if you wish, but then we might donate to someone else and 1 BTC seems reasonable  http://pastecoin.com - upload your files, set a price and get paid when people download the link! I like the concept of this idea so I ran with it:Ignore the roughness for the time being- it's only a draft.The 1 and backwards C make a b if you look. T makes the T. backwards C makes the C. And then you have the 1 at the start and backwards C looking like a 0 at the end to represent a bit.Also behold hotwheels bitcoin Has no meaning, but I thought it looks cool. Obviously the small things like "it looks a bit rough" or "the white border is uneven" disappear after processing. It's just whether others like the concept of it.100 I like the idea of making a coin with it on. Not sure about adding the C (it already has the coin idea as the 0, and it might make it too cluttered). if I have internet then I can provide you a bitcoin account at a fee if you trust me. Since internet is common the world over- even in the poorest countries, this is not a problem. Broadband is near universal. Go to any third world city and you'll find internet cafes everywhere. thanks! that's great. I'm going to set this up with cron.http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=more_faqsI added it there. Just an idea that came to me. If it's liked then I'll clean it up.It's supposed to be a b made out of a 1 and a 0 (representing a bit and the digital aspect of it), and it's round (representing it as a coin shape).http://www.speedyshare.com/files/25560952/bitcoin10.svg When you do science you're required to publish all your data and sources for independent verification. Likewise with something so easily as corruptible as a government, people need the full data to make the best choice they can in a democratic environment.It helps economically because a customer can make better choices as they have more perfect information on which to base their choices. Free market inefficiency is caused by imperfect information biasing peoples choices. Due to making choices based on other factors to fill the missing gap. Things like social proof and herding where you base your choice on what everyone else is doing (because maybe he knows more than you).Sure there's a few hiccups by a government suddenly being pried open. But in the long term, it's of benefit to have everything in the open. Even if processes have to change, or become more inefficient.
Cognitive Dissonance. Great. So I can just update every week manually? (Presuming I use less than 100 addresses in that time)What happens once 100 addresses are exceeded and you backed up your wallet 101 addresses ago?PS: Anyone can recommend some kind of automatic backup software for Linux? Esperanto took me 2 weeks 24x7 all day to learn. Bitcoin took me 5 mins to start.I can communicate with English fine everywhere. I cannot pay for things on the net, or withdraw money abroad without bending over to take it in the ass without even a kiss or a reach around.Big difference.Lastly, Esperanto is undergoing a modern revival due to the internet. Now 2 million speak it, which is comparable to a small European country like Estonia.Using your analogy I can conclude that Linux or Free Software would've been a failure... But it clearly is not! The jump will be big early on. But after a while, those small jumps will be non-noticeable.50->25 is a lot bigger impact than 1.5->0.8don't worry about it. they will insta-ban you as the software will pick it up.PS. Don't use shit-book. Boycott that crap. >ClearSignalWireless@msn.comWhy do they have a @msn.com email? And where is the link for their website? I'll just jump back in here and confirm that everything is fine. Transactions I make to old other bitcoin clients do show up. And overall my balance works and everything. Guess I'm stuck with the command line non-gui bitcoind for the time being  I heard that you need to backup your wallet after every transaction otherwise the backup is invalid. Is this true?Can anyone recommend me an auto-backup configuration for Ubuntu? Having read this thread, I've done a U-turn on my earlier view and agree. Lets protect and care for bitcoin until she leaves her nursery onto the economic killing fields. Nope. I restored my backup and still the same thing happens in .17 release client.EDIT: nevermind ignore this stupidity. My sister hadn't downloaded all the blocks yet. That's why it wasn't showing up yet.However my OP still stands. ok I'm worried something is very wrong here.- I backed up my wallet.dat- Downloaded, made svn- Sent my sister 10 BTC (still not showing after 3 confirmations for her).- When I try to open the old bitcoin I get:Code:************************EXCEPTION: 22DbRunRecoveryException       DbEnv::open: DB_RUNRECOVERY: Fatal error, run database recovery       bitcoin in AppInit()       ************************EXCEPTION: 22DbRunRecoveryException       DbEnv::open: DB_RUNRECOVERY: Fatal error, run database recovery       bitcoin in CMyApp::OnUnhandledException()       terminate called after throwing an instance of 'DbRunRecoveryException'  what():  DbEnv::open: DB_RUNRECOVERY: Fatal error, run database recoveryAbortedHave I ruined everything??  I have never had more than 100 BTC in my account ever.What is this first entry all about?Code:[    {        "account" : "",        "label" : "",        "amount" : 212.67000000,        "confirmations" : 1441    },    {        "account" : "127.0.0.1",        "label" : "127.0.0.1",        "amount" : 5.04000000,        "confirmations" : 1    },    {        "account" : "Your Address",        "label" : "Your Address",        "amount" : 5.25000000,        "confirmations" : 3    },    {        "account" : "betcoin",        "label" : "betcoin",        "amount" : 14.34000000,        "confirmations" : 6368    }] RHorning spot on. Nothing to add. bitcoind should ideally run listening. Then the bitcoin gui is simply a thin client communicating using json to the daemon.This way people can easily make custom clients IMO blaa blaa shutdown forum. we just open a new one elsewhere. lol Like I used Paypal anyway. Let them rot into oblivion. Everyone knows they're a criminal company and are decaying. How about using mimetypes and setting bitcoin as that default mimetype.i.edownload and open address.bitcoin which contains the string 15kDhRAcpgsugmh6mQsTcCHdvbsuYncEEVWould be a hell of a lot easier and very simple to implement. I suppose you're right. Hey,In the future there will be many different online bitcoin providers holding your money in a virtual wallet.dat online.Many websites will want to accept bitcoin payments from a 'Tip Jar' button that requires minimal effort to click if you're logged in through OpenID.The many content providers will need to agree on a method for allowing tipping, together with the online bitcoin services.----- Sign up to mybitcoin.com or whatever wallet service using an OpenID.- Viewing video on dansblog.org. You like that.- Click Tip Jar first time.- OpenID sign up screen.- dansblog.org contacts distributed database (like DNS) to lookup your wallet provider.- dansblog.org redirects you to https://mybitcoin.com/mywallet.php?send=5&address=dsjsdjksdjksdjdsk23iuweewkc- mybitcoin.com saves redirect header (who redirected). Displays confirmation page.- You click OK- Redirects back to previously viewing webpage.Now I propose that we all decide on the distributed database part, so that we can start adding in wallet providers and provide an easy way to provide consistent service between many different services.The returned URL would have an option for the amount to send and the address to send to.What do you think? It'd be good to write a spec and put it out there. Even if it isn't written yet, there would be a definitive document that we point people to and say 'this is how it's done. comply with the standard.'dansblog.org and felixsweb.org could both use different databases but they both sync with each other. I'm part of the way the way through the interview and wow, you've done a fantastic job. The intro about Linux was necessary IMO and well done. good job. This is why we need an automated bitcoin service for new people :p Where they can download their online wallets and shut down their accounts if they wish.
Mention my story:I was donated 0.5 bitcoins then turned it to 100 bitcoins playing poker  This makes sense- that markets move towards peaks. This suggests that valleys pose a serious problem to the evolution of markets. Especially since evolution in nature doesn't only change incrementally (there's other selection processes which produce many forms very rapidly).Can you explain why the vendors shift from a uniform to a normal distribution? What strategy causes this?Would like to chat more with you and discuss ideas if you're on IRC or email. Good ideas so far- thanks.Immunisation is a loss for the individual. For the group it is a gain. This is not a hard concept.Example:Voting is -EV (negative expected value). I have to waste time, effort, energy... And my vote has nearly 0 effect.However the cumulative effect of a whole population voting is a gain for everyone together (from the viewpoint of getting people to vote).In that same way, immunisation for an individual is useless unless a critical mass of the population also immunises themselves at the same time. For me it's a slightly -EV choice. For everyone together, it's massively +EV. Hey,I have no feelings against any type of politics (except mild+ authoritarianist governments). In principle I really like the idea of personal freedom- everyone can do whatever they want as long as it doesn't affect me. However everyone is not a separate island and we do all affect each other. I'm going to illustrate with 3 examples:In the UK seatbelts are mandatory otherwise you get a fine. All cars come equipped with seatbelts. I love seatbelts since they significantly reduce the risk to my life by many orders of magnitude. In Iran not many people wear seatbelts. Often many cars just don't have them. So if I want to take a taxi then I can only have the choice to risk the taxi or not take it. Add to this that road laws are virtually non-existant and cars just swamp the roads (meaning road accidents are super high). My life is endangered by someone else having their freedom.In the UK it is illegal to smoke indoors. Otherwise I would be the single person in a group that boycotts places which allow indoor smoking. Either my life is endangered through risk to my health by someone else having their freedom, or I am a lonely person. As someone with bad asthma, it's killing when in other poorer countries people smoke everywhere and I can hardly breathe.Immunisation only works once a majority of the population has been vaccinated. Vaccination does not prevent you getting an illness- only makes it less likely. In this way the disease is less likely to transfer across to another person and it's more difficult to spread. So difficult that it disappears. However for the individual, it's not worth the cost. And for immunisation to be effective, it needs mass mobilisation. Who would organise a state-wide immunisation campaign for a net loss?Thanks. Looking forward to feedback. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11811238 I have some friends working on free(dom) federated social networking softwarehttp://n-1.cc/ grains of sand on the earth.planets in the our galaxyseconds in the lifetime of the universe/earthnumber of people who ever lived. I love this idea. Know that Julian Assange (the founder and head of Wikileaks) was a former Free Software programmer and wrote lots of cryptographic tools. He is very knowledgeable in this area himself and will understand Bitcoin technically. Hey,I wanted to send a letter to Wikileaks about Bitcoin since unfortunately they've had several incidents where their funds have been seized in the past.http://wikileaks.org/media/support.htmlAnyone know where to send a message to them? It would be a massive accomplishment to have a human settlement on Mars. The boon to science and living standards would be incredible from the challenges that need to be solved. Suddenly we'd be abundant in rare resources- everyone on Earth would be rich from Mars-Earth trade. It's the new frontier of exploration.And it's not a flag on the surface exercise. Any mission to Mars would require people staying on the surface a minimum of 6 months as the window to fly back to Earth does not happen often. In fact many (Buzz Aldrin included) argue it should be a one-way mission.I'm not sure how you can argue against "Useless intellectual work", when the internet you're using is a product of that. A society needs to support it's artisans and thinkers to have a healthy vibrant culture. The single movers among the thousand sheep make the payoff worth it. I assure you it's not propaganda- it's quite possible given our current technology. Mars Direct would place the first habitating humans on Mars for the cost of $55 billion over 10 years. NASA's current budget is $13 billion and luckily they've now set Mars by mid 2030 in their scope.Unlike the Moon, Mars has an atmosphere which you use to create rocket fuel and oxygen, water, minerals for plastics and metals, earth-like day of 24 hours and 0 deg celsius at the tropics (higher deep in canyons!). It's truly the next step and well within our grasp.$10 billion / year is a drop in the ocean compared to the annual war budget of $650 billion (plain disgusting), so it's sad to see you attack science that's helping us spread forth to other worlds and expanding out as a race. Stay on Earth and our resources will run dry. We attack our neighbours for what limited resources there are because we will see them as competitors for survival- a rascist world compared to the resource abundant one where humanity is global brotherhood pooling our brains to come up with new creative solutions.An asteroid hits the Earth and we all die out. Nice while it lasted. lolzoracle-aments. dumbasses :p I just read all of that but wanted to make a new post to address my specific point about people being able to build up large bases of capital to make worthwhile investments.1 Good investment vs 1000000x shitty ones When I first discovered Bitcoin, my reaction was "Ohhh, deflation. Bad.". Having thought about this, is that really the case?Sure inflation encourages spending, but mostly the willy nilly impulsive consumerism. If people were encouraged to save, then people would have large amounts of capital to spend on larger worthwhile projects.And people always need to pay for *something*. Trade still continues. Micropayments for insignificant amounts aren't stopped because Person X's currency is slightly deflationary rather than inflationary.Can anyone correct me if I'm wrong? This is a biased place to ask but what the hell  I used to be a graphics designer and spent some days making these. You can say they're shit if you think so- I don't take criticism personally.Smaller versions:what do you reckon Vi ne pravas.
