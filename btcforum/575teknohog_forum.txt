It's easy if you already have an account at Stex. Otherwise, KYC can be a bitch. Are there other active exchanges for BBR that don't have KYC?It's also weird to have KYC if you are exchanging from one anonymous coin to another, as is the case here. The exchange will know that this real verified person exchanged X BBR to Y ZANO, but they have no way of tracing either transaction very far. I see a couple of problems with HDD mining. First of all, if the mining is profitable, some people will start building huge storage farms, just like is done with PoW mining hardware, and it will use a lot of energy and materials. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox.Second, assuming that home farming with your existing general-purpose hardware remains feasible, it has a huge drawback compared to CPU or GPU mining. For example, I've bought GPUs for work but they can spend most of their time mining. In most cases the miner can stay running in the background all the time. In some cases I'll need the whole GPU to my work, but even then, I can easily resume mining after that.This doesn't work with HDD farming. If I want to use that drive for something else, I first have to delete the plotfiles, and then later regenerate those plots with a lot of CPU time and energy. So you will need dedicated farming drives, or at least some dedicated drive space.I've been testing out small-time Chia farming since just before the mainnet launch, and I even bought a new drive for it, knowing I can still use it for something else if this doesn't work out nicely. I like playing with new technologies in their early stages, and I guess I have a soft spot for Bram Cohen -- I remember when Bittorrent came out, and I like coding in Python myself. I'd like to be proved wrong about the above reservations  Chia mainnet has just launched. Am I seriously the only one on Bitcointalk doing Chia, or is there another thread? I think the card itself should be fine for mining. At least the VRAM is not an issue, I mine Zano with cards as low as 2 GB. But something is wrong if the miner is picking up an Intel device. If you have both Intel and AMD OpenCL drivers installed, you might need the --cl-devices option with the correct device number. Try --list-devices to find those numbers. That guide doesn't say anything about minimum VRAM, which I think is a pretty gross omission.Anyway, 3 or 4 GB cards won't work. The MTP scratchpad itself needs 4 GB and then you needs some for the rest of the program, so the total is about 4.5 GB. If you can find a 5 GB card that should work. 6 GB is plenty.I recommend the official https://github.com/firoorg/ccminer as it is open source with no hidden fees. I haven't found a closed miner whose speed increase is worth the fee (and the risk of running untrusted software). Screen doesn't put the program in the background in the usual sense. It makes the program run in a virtual terminal, which you can still access normally. I use screen a lot so I can keep lots of terminal programs running, without being visible all at once. You can put screen itself in the background with all the programs running within, and open it later (perhaps when connecting from another machine).I think this is its most essential feature. Many people learned to use screen around 2000 for using IRC; they could leave their IRC client running on some server, and return to their session the next day, without keeping their own computer on all the time.For actually putting zanod in the background, I use the --no-console option. SoCode:./zanod --no-console &or to make it extra sureCode:./zanod --no-console >/dev/null 2>/dev/null & Me neither. I'd really like to see an example of some other coin that has succesfully rebranded. Or any other product/project out there in the real world. I notice that the new daemon update/rebase has lost the traditional getinfo RPC command. While it has its replacements, I cannot find the old "moneysupply" number anywhere. Is it still available somewhere via RPC? Trading is now live at Stex. It was previously known as Stocks.exchange and I've used it since late 2017.https://app.stex.com/en/basic-trade/pair/BTC/ZANO?ref=18645393 You do realize that mining profitability is relative to coin price and difficulty, not just absolute wattage? For example, on my GTX 1070, Wild Keccak uses 92 W while MTP (Zcoin) uses over 150 W. But I still mine the latter because it nets me much more, even after paying for electricity.Absolute wattages can be a problem due to hardware health and noise, but you can usually limit those by other means. In fact, reducing total power will often increase efficiency (hash/J). Finland's leading cryptocurrency company recently got a female CEO. I couldn't find an English announcement but here are some relevant links:https://bittiraha.fi/muutoksia-prasos-oyn-johdossa/https://prasos.fi/ I don't think a 750Ti has enough video memory. The miner needs at least 4.5 GB. This. High hashrates mean fast and simple hash functions, which are very ASIC-friendly, and it's not what the community wanted. It's also a bit like the Megahertz Myth of CPUs: do you care about real-life performance or a meaningless number?Still, the memory requirements of Zcoin's current MTP implementation are quite steep. A 4GB GPU is not enough, you need 6GB in practice (as there are no GPUs with 4.5 or 5GB). This means only newer GPUs. A lot of people have GPUs with 1..4 GB VRAM, and they are now useless for Zcoin. Hash is being concentrated to those with the latest GPUs.If the MTP miner only required 1 or 2 GB, we could distribute the hash to a much wider community. And I guess it would still be ASIC resistant, because a factor of 2 is not a deal breaker. https://github.com/zcoinofficial/ccminer says:"mtp requires 4Gb of vram, hence cards with less than 4.5Gb of vram won't work. while running, ccminer will also use around 5.5Gb of ram."I've tested the miner on a GTX 960 4GB, and it didn't work, as expected. GTX 1060 6GB and GTX 1070 8GB were fine, though slower than expected, both around 100 kh/s. I've also struggled with the recent build issue, which is obviously related to zlib/gzip. This commit seems to be to blame:https://github.com/cryptozoidberg/boolberry/commit/d1be390e63147631fa2ca16a48f74b8333c86bfbas it builds fine when checking out the preceding version. This one looks like it bundles a copy of zlib instead of using external libraries -- I wonder why? Good point. Those who want masternodes should first explainwhat is the problem that masternodes are trying to solve, andhow would masternodes actually solve the probleminstead of running around like Steve Ballmer shouting "masternodes" in place of "developers". There's one thing I absolutely accept about masternodes. We should totally reward those who maintain stable nodes with good uptime and connectivity. But all the masternode schemes I've seen include a large deposit of money. That's the bit that goes completely against all logic and ideals I've known so far.In general, I pay people for useful services. I don't pay people just because they already have money. In the real world, rich people don't get richer simply by having all that money, but because they use their money sensibly -- for example, on servers and Internet infrastructure.Moreover, I don't want a world where you need a hefty deposit in order to be a service provider. I'll rather trust a distributed P2P network than an oligarchy of a few rich players. Isn't that why we have cryptocurrencies in the first place? If you want old-time big-money capitalism, you can already do that outside the crypto world. I don't represent the BBR community, but I've been here for a while (see my profile). In my opinion, masternodes are completely against the original ideals of cryptocurrencies, as I explain in the link in my signature. (I probably have enough BBR to be in the "masternode class" of BBR users, but I don't think I should be granted any special privileges for it.) It's also interesting how all the Monero (and Zcash) variants were supposed to be ASIC proof. After ASICs for them materialized, the mining algos were changed in a whack-a-mole fashion, without any serious regard for ASIC resistance (e.g. similar memory requirements). Meanwhile, BBR's Wild Keccak remains out of reach for current ASIC tech. No algo is technically ASIC proof, but there are different levels of resistance, and BBR's is looking very high in comparison.(I keep hearing about MTP that's supposed to in a league of its own, but so far, nothing has been delivered. BBR delivered its algo many years ago. I wouldn't be surprised if some other coin adopted Wild Keccak, but the NIH syndrome is strong in cryptocurrencies.) It's been in use since May this year. If you're going to complain, then please try and do some basic homework first.
If you're selling a fork of a GPL project, then where is the source? Or do you just admit you are violating a free software license? Give us the source (like you're supposed to do anyway) and some of us will compile it for you. That's one of the benefits of open source. Came to ask the same thing. If you're distributing a modified version of a GPL project, and not providing the source, you're committing license violation.Closed source is bad enough by itself for a lot of reasons. Especially in cryptocurrencies which are open community efforts. It's even worse if you're admitting you're leeching off community code.I'm assuming you don't feel like releasing the source because of the donation/fee percentage. Frankly, I don't have a good answer for that -- I've released some opensource code myself, and I sometimes feel I've been cheated by some Chinese knockoff projects that use my code without crediting me. But I guess imitation is the sincerest form of flattery  Meaning that there are ways to make an honest living with opensource code. For starters, respect the licenses and maybe people will also respect your coding skills. In this case, I think you'll needCode:git checkout lmdb_coreafter the "cd boolberry" part, to get the correct branch for testing. This happened to me some time ago. The transaction itself was legitimate, as verified by chainradar.com, but it never registered at btc-alpha. I sent multiple support messages over a couple of weeks, but none were answered in any way. Other exhanges generally say something like "Sorry about the trouble, we're working on the issue" even if they don't solve it right away. I've given up on them, I simply write them off as another shady/incompetent exchange, and wait for better ones to come. What good would that do to anyone? (See also: my sig) Agreed. Monero's idea of slightly altering the PoW parameters every X months is just whack-a-mole, and doesn't sound like a proper development plan for any serious tech person. On the plus side, at least they are admitting that the PoW they devised to be ASIC-resistant in the past isn't very resistant now, because (omg) technology moves on. (Gosh, is it really 7 years since we developed the first Bitcoin FPGA miners? I still have that dev board lying around.)For something arguably more ASIC-resistant, Boolberry has had its Wild Keccak for a few years, but I guess it's NIH for everyone else. Zcoin's upcoming MTP also looks interesting with its multi-gigabyte memory requirements. But even they won't be ASIC-proof forever -- remember when 640 KB was enough for everybody? There's a natural limit from the total money supply. Currently there's about 4.5 million XZC in total, so you can't make more than about 4500 masternodes. Or 21000 nodes when it's all mined.However... what good is a currency if it's all locked up in masternodes? Shady or just incompetent. I quit trading there after a lost deposit and multiple support calls with no answer. Speaking of cloning the repo, what good is open source if you can't compile your own binaries?https://github.com/zcoinofficial/zcoin/issues/196 Yea, but not any higher so far. The "high" profile gives the same frequencies as "default". What's worse, all non-default profiles go to "low" speeds when the monitor is off.For details see https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Radeon#Power_management and in this case, dynamic power management must be disabled with the kernel option radeon.dpm=0. The dynamic setting doesn't have the monitor (DPMS) issue.For comparison, using fglrx gives 875 kh/s at 1100/350 MHz, about the same power judging from similar temperatures. Fun times: I'm getting 1400 kh/s on a Radeon 7970 with opensource Linux drivers. Default clocks of 950/1450 MHz and I estimate the power draw at 150 W max. (For comparison, my GTX 1070 does about 1600 kh/s at 100 W). I've seen my share of miners reporting wrong numbers, but this one is verified by a pool over a full day, so it's looking legit.This is with Linux 4.15.12, mesa 18.0.0_rc5, llvm 6.0.0 and xf86-video-ati 18.0.1. It should be noted that the newer opensource AMDGPU driver isn't available for the 7970, but the real action for OpenGL/OpenCL is happening with Mesa and LLVM, and there have been some great developments.I've been testing the opensource driver stack for a while, as I've sold most of my Radeons and I've stopped patching the old binary driver (fglrx) for newer kernels. So far, it's been slower, around 650 kh/s vs. 875 with fglrx. This incredible leap came after the latest Mesa and LLVM updates. It's been known for a while that the opensource stack outperforms the old binaries in many applications, but this is a first for me with miners.While great for BBR, there aren't many other miners that work at all with the OS drivers. Newer miners use OpenCL 2.0 which isn't implemented yet, and there are other issues. So I guess I'll keep this machine for BBR only for now Also noting this is a rather slow machine with 1x PCIe bus, but it's probably irrelevant for BBR mining. https://c-patex.com/ works great, I like the LTC pairings in particular. Do you need a publicly accessible node in order to mint? I.e. public IP address or port forwarding. I imagine it's a simple and fairly common question, but I haven't found the answer anywhere.I recently had to move a node from a public machine to a NATted one, and after about a month I haven't seen any minting activity. I didn't found anything about the usual DB solutions in their github, but there'shttps://github.com/CryptoCoinLabs/darknetspace/commit/892acf0154d34f8cca19a3930f5bb66c66701442which looks like a different solution to the memory issue. I guess someone more knowledgeable might be able to comment on it. How does one claim BTCP from BTC? Will it accept both private key formats? Using "-d 8" only selects a single GPU, starting with 0 for the first GPU. It looks like there's a hardcoded limit of 8 GPUs since it ignores the 9th one. Indeed, there's a line in gpu.h:Code:#define MAX_GPU 8so you could change this and rebuild the miner. I was also worried about FPGA profitability, and for BLC only it doesn't look good. However, other coins on the merge pools such as PHO remain quite profitable, so in total this is still worth it.I've done some FPGA development in the past and I believe I could find other uses for them besides mining. But last time I checked, the Spartan 6s in the Ztex boards cannot be programmed with free tools, you need to buy a license. Boolberry is far from dead. It was quiet for some time, but there have been burst of development, and since last summer it has really picked up the pace with new exchanges and development roadmaps.https://github.com/cryptozoidberg/boolberry/commits/masterhttps://stocks.exchange/trade/BBR/BTChttps://cryptochangex.com/markets/bbrbtc Personally, I'm not that excited about a future where only millionaires are allowed to run full nodes of a P2P currency. But maybe it's just me.
The masternode option pumps the price, as some people want to have their share of the 30% cake, no matter what the one-time investment. The 1000s of XZC are then locked up in the nodes, out of circulation, so there's further pressure to increase the price for the few remaining coins. Make of that what you will... I sent you a personal message yesterday, as I don't like sharing my folders to the entire world. Yes, plus a public IP address. https://zcoin.io/znodes-specifications-release-founders-rewards-reduction/ There is no Proof-of-Stake in Zcoin. For that you might look at other coins such as Peercoin, where the whole idea was conceived.Znodes don't increase the money supply by staking, they only redistribute the usual 50 XZC block rewards (thus making the rich even richer, to put it bluntly). Monero or Aeon. It depends on the CPU though, and Zcoin is still quite profitable despite the extra tax.(Normally I would dismiss such questions as off-topic. However, losing miners to other coins is something you should expect when introducing masternodes, especially at such a high tax.) You get paid to solve math problems.For example, mersenne.org is a huge project where people spend tons of computing power for no obvious monetary gain (although there's a prize for discovering new prime numbers). Here, you get smaller rewards for every block solved, which involve other prime-related problems. To me, it's better use of CPU power than mersenne.org; both projects do interesting math, but Gapcoin solves more practical problems as a cryptocurrency.You should note that very few cryptocurrencies do any kind of useful work with their block verification. Some of those rely on central servers for work distribution, which breaks the core principles of cryptocurrencies. Gapcoin is one of the few genuine cryptocurrencies that do science on the side (along with Primecoin and Riecoin -- are there any others?). Aeon does not have Proof of Stake, and I'm not aware of any working Cryptonote coin that has it.Incidentally though, there was a PoS Cryptonote project called Louis d'or. While there's no release in sight, the PoW hash used by Aeon was originally developed in that project. https://wiki.bytecoin.org/wiki/Daemon_JSON_RPC_APIhttps://wiki.bytecoin.org/wiki/Wallet_JSON_RPC_APIThese don't cover all of Boolberry RPC functions, but it's a good start, worked for me and my scripts. The difference is that Dash needs masternodes to perform coin mixing, as they don't have proper anon tech like Cryptonote, Zerocash or Zerocoin. But in practice there's not much difference -- any kind of masternode concept breaks the original idea of decentralized cryptocurrencies, and brings back old-time big-money capitalism. Wow, so many changes coming up. Will it still be the same coin? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus(also, will there be confusion with an old copycoin? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=206361.0) Algorithm or its current implementation? That is my question. It could just be that the current miner implementation isn't well optimized -- it doesn't fully use all available GPU power. Of course, it's part of the design, so GPU miners won't get too far ahead of CPUs. But it gets more complicated when you compare CUDA and OpenCL miner performance. https://stocks.exchange/trade/XBB/BTC I believe it's down to funding and marketing. Monero has some of the big boys like rpietila behind it. In a way it's the most boring of the privacy-oriented coins, and big money people like the stability. This is like asking why Windows is the most popular desktop OS  Exactly. Is the interface actually any different from Monero, which has been on lots of exchanges for aeons? (Pun intended -- Aeon is even closer to BBR in some ways including the RAM issue, though it's only in a few exchanges now.) <3 In my experience, Aeon is like a Monero that is fast/light enough to be actually usable. (I have both running on the same machine with the same compiler settings.) I have a hard time understanding the success of Monero with so much better variants out there, but I guess it's just for being there first.Boolberry is another interesting variant, with more advanced tech in some ways, e.g. having a GUI very early on, but less lucky with its developers and exchanges. I'm still rooting for BBR, but of these three, Aeon looks like the most likely to be of practical use in the future. I don't mind a moderate founders' tax, if it helps ongoing development and marketing etc.IMHO, a masternode reward is useful as it provides an incentive to keep up a full node; we need more than just miners to maintain the network. Reward schemes for nodes have been proposed in other coins starting from Bitcoin, and the Bitnodes project already has some kind of a program for that.Node rewards should be based on uptime and connectivity, as those are what really matters. Investors should spend their money on actual technology for nodes and miners, not arbitrary stakes of money. That way we should get more stable nodes -- the 1000 XZC limit only favours the few, and there's no comparable incentive for others to maintain full nodes. The way I read it, mining tax is increased from 20% to 44% (ouch!), thus making GPU mining less profitable.I used to think cryptocurrencies were all about decentralization. But with masternodes, we're back to old-time capitalism, where big investors get disproportionately large returns. Thanks, working fine so far  Much nicer/faster than Cryptopia which I've used for the other Blake coins. Let's hope more people sign up, maybe you'll also add more coins/trading pairs later. I noticed too, it is now fixed in the sources. Don't know about binary releases though.https://github.com/z-classic/zclassic/commit/0d7b77f0f14cb2d88f3acc8b29ee30a0dcb192bc
Same here. Is this some leftover from the original Zcash? Not enough fiber in the network, I guess  This is not an ICO if that's what you think. Feel free to buy SKC at Cryptopia like anyone else. Delayed. See the official Boolberry thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=577267.msg23990618#msg23990618 Thanks for the notice, your work is appreciated  No announcements? What's this then?https://news.kucoin.com/en/kucoin-will-list-boolberrybbr-on-31st-october/They are obviously behind their schedule, as deposits are still not enabled. But there's also no news about them giving up the listing. I'm not exactly hodling my breath, but they're the first exchange to publicly announce BBR listing (not just private communication) in a long time, so I'll give them a chance. They announced trading would start on Oct 31, with wallets open on Oct 28 to give people time for deposits. However, the wallets are still not up, so I'd expect the trading to be delayed too. So this is not related?https://news.kucoin.com/en/announcement-about-the-issue-we-had-tonight/Quite a coin-cidence to have such an attack just before the planned opening of wallets. From the announcement you linked:"Kucoin will list Boolberry(BBR) on 31st, October."This might look like nitpicking, but they're specifically listing Boolberry under the original and widely accepted ticker BBR, instead of this weird "XBB" that has been proposed in some circles.To register at Kucoin for BBR (not XBB) trading, please find the correct link in my signature  Even if you don't have to worry about wattage, what about the costs involved inmotherboard with more slostspower suppliesfloor/shelf/case spaceheat and noise? "This reverts bad commit". https://github.com/zcoinofficial/zcoin/commit/8fc1b2622afa82eb1ce94ead97ffd2367a3903f2 Yes, but if you look at the history of other cryptocoins, the likelihood of such forks living on is quite low.A centralized coinswap is much worse in this respect, IMHO. I'd certainly be wary of sending all my coins to a "trusted" party, and I'd seriously look into maintaining a "classic" version. In contrast, it is much easier to simply update your software and accept the fact that old clients are no longer compatible. After updating to the latest git version, the daemon prompted me to -reindex the database. Since then it's been stuck on block 54396. I've done a complete resync from scratch, with the same results. The log has a repeating complaint about a single block:Code:2017-10-21 10:01:24 ERROR: AcceptBlockHeader: block 226b443c3f8b387ebea927b5aa2cc07b544df1ef1dbd5f2e9c37b4a0bd3fe4fa is marked invalid2017-10-21 10:01:24 ERROR: AcceptBlockHeader: block 226b443c3f8b387ebea927b5aa2cc07b544df1ef1dbd5f2e9c37b4a0bd3fe4fa is marked invalid2017-10-21 10:05:27 ERROR: AcceptBlockHeader: block 226b443c3f8b387ebea927b5aa2cc07b544df1ef1dbd5f2e9c37b4a0bd3fe4fa is marked invalid2017-10-21 10:05:27 ERROR: AcceptBlockHeader: block 226b443c3f8b387ebea927b5aa2cc07b544df1ef1dbd5f2e9c37b4a0bd3fe4fa is marked invalid2017-10-21 10:05:29 ERROR: AcceptBlockHeader: block 226b443c3f8b387ebea927b5aa2cc07b544df1ef1dbd5f2e9c37b4a0bd3fe4fa is marked invalidAny ideas? I see all these hints on CPU mining threads, and I wonder if people look at their actual hashrates or simply trust the theory. Because with some CPUs, using 1 thread per CPU core is faster than the default. I see it with AMD FX-8320E and A4-5000 (using xmrig, but the effect is the same with other miners).The A4-5000 in particular is interesting, as it only has 2 MB of L2 cache and no L3. I guess the execution units are so slow as to negate any cache speedups.With my i5-7300HQ, the default of 3 threads at 4 cores is faster. Besides the cache size effect, in this case there's also Turbo Boost, which allows higher clockspeeds when fewer cores are loaded. So you get more speedup than simply from the cache size.Of course, the situation can be complicated by other programs running on the same machine. But in most practical cases, the other programs only take short bursts of CPU time, so long-term hashrates should not be affected. I don't see anything fair about either of those, they look like huge middle fingers to me. I understand that exchanges have their expenses and they want to make a profit, but that's what the trading fees should be for. At current rates, 1 BTC should be enough to hire a developer for a month. Mine was credited automatically. This is also the way I expected it to be, based on shorter maintenance periods of other coins. Nevertheless, I checked that they still have the same wallet address and payment ID, before any further sends. Interesting comments on anon cryptos:https://cointelegraph.com/news/snowden-ventures-cryptocurrency-opinion-on-twitterZcash is the only altcoin (that I know of) designed and built by professional and academic cryptographers. Hard to ignore.He also refers to Monero as an amateur crypto, and there is a mention of a Monero bug that "allows for the creation of an unlimited number of coins in a way that is undetectable to an observer". I thought this was particularly ironic in the context, given that Zcash doesn't have an auditable supply, so in principle it has a similar risk. In contrast, such issues would be detectable in Zcoin.I'm also pretty sure that Zcash isn't the only "professional" altcoin in this sense. https://hitbtc.com/exchange/AEON-to-BTC works fine for me. I noticed this last week and promptly sent some of my Aeon there for trading. I think BBR is established enough in this community already. Besides, there are too many X** coins around, thus diluting any prestige related to the international standards.Most importantly, though, BBR stands for Bender Bending Rodriguez, a character associated with Zoidberg BTW, I'm also wondering about the HitBTC listing schedule. I generally find Aeon more profitable to mine, though it depends somewhat on the hardware. If you want to invest in Monero long-term, then better buy it directly.Monero is currently favoured in botnets, as it's a fairly mainstream coin where CPU mining remains viable. Botnet operators don't have to worry about electric bills, so exact profitability is not an issue, but it drives the network difficulty needlessly higher.As a hobbyist, I prefer dealing with lesser known emerging coins. Besides other interesting possibilities, it is easier to gather a significant chunk of the coin, which may turn out very profitable in the future. This is also quite a practical issue for mining; with the high difficulty of Monero, it takes a while to accumulate the minimum payout of typical pools.
Good point, especially since Aeon has exactly the same database issue as BBR (and they are also working on a LMDB solution). I thought the point of MTP is to make CPU miners competitive with GPUs. So a bunch of private GPU miners shouldn't be a problem. Assuming of course that the daemon-internal CPU miner works as expected (or regular CPU miners are available). I'm also a bit worried about miner availability upon algo change. However, I expect the internal CPU miner of the daemon to work. After all, it will have the correct algo for verifying blocks. In fact, that might make things interesting again, just like the old times of Bitcoin in 2009-2010 before external miners. I've already posted similar comments on other crypto threads, but here's my general take on this:The code space for X** is quite limited with only two variable letters. This has worked fine with just a handful of codes like XAU and XDR, but it will be confusing if all major cryptos start adopting the scheme. With only two letters the codes cannot be very descriptive.ISO codes are mainly for national currencies, and as such represent the old world where only nations can issue and control money. In cryptocurrencies, we have a much improved system for the new world, and I see no need to pander to the old powers. "Please give me an ISO code, I want to be taken as seriously as EUR and USD which can be printed willy-nilly at the whim of governments." This. IMHO, Zcoin's primary feature over other coins is the Zerocoin protocol, with its auditable supply being a notable difference from Zcash. This is what makes Zcoin great right now, not promises of some future hash algo. I'll buy all your remaining Aeons for 1 Satoshi apiece. PM for details. Do you ever use Google? That's a childish company name if I ever heard one. In fact, its original form "googol" was actually made up by a 9-year old child. Also, look at other cool technology companies of today. No "grownup" names whatsoever.Most importantly, the naming issue has already been discussed earlier, and there's nothing to add. So please do as I say, not as I do, and stop commenting about it  One also takes about 200x the time to sync, presumably due to a heavier hash function. This is one reason why Aeon was developed, to make a lighter version of Monero. Boolberry has a very different solution to making the hash memory-hard while keeping it fast to verify.Unfortunately, both Aeon and Boolberry use a lot of RAM as they maintain the entire blockchain in memory. It was the same with Monero until it adapted LMDB, and it should be on the radar for the other two given time and/or money.In my impression, Monero is the big and heavy player of Cryptonote coins with the most money behind it, while the interesting innovations happen elsewhere. It's a bit like Bitcoin vs. all other coins. A good day to you, sir, too. Agreed. The X prefix seems important to some people, making the coin seem like established currencies like XAU. But the one coin that seriously competes with XAU is still better known as BTC than XBT or whatever. I think it shows that cryptocurrencies stand on their own and have no need to bend to the old world rules. Wow, so mining at a big pool gets you hundreds of times the income of a small pool? Interesting.Any decent pool should give the same average income over time, but when the hashrate gets too small, you're seeing these unfortunate variance effects. Everyone complains when the round progress (luck) gets up to hundreds of percent, but nobody talks about the fast rounds that balance it out. I'm keeping my modest 2 Mh/s on Suprnova as I trust the math, and Suprnova has proved reliable so far.Meanwhile, there's always solo mining. A lot of modern coins don't provide obvious methods for solo mining, instead you need to set up a personal pool or a proxy. But solo mining was the way cryptocurrencies started out, as it was the natural way to keep things distributed. (For the first year or so, Bitcoin didn't even have getwork, the only way to mine was with the daemon's built-in CPU miner.) Zcoin is nicer than many others in this regard. Am I the only one who doesn't like the idea of masternodes? To me, they sound like centralization and oligarchy, the very things that cryptocurrencies were created to stand against.I recall Darkcoin (now Dash) introduced masternodes to facilitate coin mixing. Truly anonymous coins like Boolberry have no such needs. Proof of Stake is a useful concept, and it could be allowed for anyone, not just select few rich ones.I'd like Boolberry to stay equally accessible to anyone, instead of making some nodes more equal than others. Of course, PoS rewards could be proportional to the staked amount, as they do in the original PoS coin, Peercoin. There's no need to set up artificial barriers for entry. Thanks for the update. I also noticed this (from your miner):Code:[2017-04-11 14:45:54.812] [GPU1] Device: GeForce GTX 750[2017-04-11 14:45:54.812] [GPU1] Total device memory: 979 MB[2017-04-11 14:45:54.812] [GPU1] Maximum buffer size: 244 MBSo I guess this one won't be mining BBR for long. My other Nvidias seem to have the same 1/4 ratio of max buffer size to total memory. AMD looks a bit better in this regard:Code:[2017-04-11 14:53:10.171] [GPU0] Platform: AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing[2017-04-11 14:53:10.171] [GPU0] Device: Tahiti[2017-04-11 14:53:10.171] [GPU0] Total device memory: 3002 MB[2017-04-11 14:53:10.171] [GPU0] Maximum buffer size: 2100 MBSomething to keep in mind if you're looking for bargain GPUs for mining. Or maybe there's a workaround? I've also filed a ticket. There's no need to report every single exchange glitch here, but it may be noteworthy that this has happened over and over since their Aeon wallet returned from maintenance. Try ./aeond --no-console so it won't attempt to read any input lines. My deposits are now fully credited so at least that's one problem solved. Same here. Judging from the confirmation numbers and the times they were sent, it's the blockchain at Bittrex that isn't updating, and there's nothing specifically weird about these transactions. But I could be wrong... Bittrex wallet has been up all day (it's afternoon here), I've succesfully deposited coins there. Yup, I filed a ticket yesterday and still no resolution. The pool estimates the hashrate based on recent shares, so it's unlikely to match the real hashrate (unless averaged over a long time).
It's the same but without the extra factor of 2^32. The same, simple logic seems to apply to all Cryptonote coins. X is used in traditional exchanges for non-national currencies, such as XAU for gold. So you see things like XBT for Bitcoin:http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=XBT&To=XAUPersonally, I don't see any need to pander to this old-money crowd. Cryptocurrencies are truly global, no need to play second fiddle to the national currencies. I wanted to quit trading, so I decided to take all my remaining coins home. But for some reason I just couldn't... I was having withdrawal symptoms. It seems some people want the X** currency symbol because it matches the standard of non-national currencies, for example XAU for gold ounce. However, there's not enough room for all altcoins to do this, and it's hard to stay descriptive with only 2 letters left.In my opinion, we shouldn't pander to the old-money crowd and their antiquated standards, because cryptocurrencies live in their own new world. Agreed. Also, I like my cryptocurrencies stable in the long term, not changing algos every now and then. Other coins seem to manage fine with their initial choice of hash algo, including Bitcoin -- the big challenges are elsewhere. Good point. In my case, I already have a ton of stuff in a screen, and I prefer to daemonize everything that doesn't need interaction. But for the original poster, screen might be just fine, and it's arguably easier in some ways. Something likeCode:nohup ./boolbd --no-console >/dev/null 2>&1 &should work. It literally means "no hangup", and the rest just ensures there's no visible output. At least there's a serious suggestion, I wish more coins would do this. I've ended up setting personal pools, as today's coins are no longer following the original ideals of decentralization. It feels incredibly wasteful for something that was simple and natural just a while ago.Back in 2010, you could only mine bitcoins with the daemon itself, and of course it was CPU-only. The first GPU miners came with a patch to the daemon to support "getwork", and soon it became official. First pools used getwork but it was too heavy and slow for such distributed work, so getblocktemplate and Stratum were developed. It would be great if we could still use getwork or GBT locally.In fact, the problem can also be solved by better miners, without changes to the daemon.  Bitcoin-based coins have GBT, which the pool uses to make work available for miners. There are some rare coin/miner combos where GBT can be used directly with miners. Whatever the equivalent of GBT is in Cryptonote coins, that should be a valid alternative for enabling solo mining.Alternatively, a proxy could be developed to work between the daemon and current miners -- basically a simplified version of pools, without all the databases and accounting. Actually, the same idea affects anything that listens to JSON-RPC commands without needing authorization. This includes cryptocurrencies such as Vcash and Ethereum, besides the Cryptonote family wallets. A general solution is not running these on the same machine with your web browser -- they only listen on localhost by default. Boolberry (BBR) is the currency. Original thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=577267.0Profitability is pretty good on GPUs, and not just the latest ones. I use HD 7970s and GTX 750s, for example. It is quite volatile right now, as this is a smaller community compared to something like Monero (it's a common comparison, as BBR uses the same privacy-oriented Cryptonote codebase). In fact, many other cryptocurrencies besides the Cryptonote family have a similar issue. For example, Vanillacoin/Vcash and Ethereum don't have RPC authentication by default, though of course they only listen on localhost. I'm not aware of similar attacks on them, but it's good to keep in mind as a general principle. BBR daemon has the RPC command get_all_alias_details() for listing all aliases. The following uses my script (https://github.com/teknohog/bittools) for a cleaner printout:Code:$ cnfo.py --listaliases | grep blocko1blockologist                    1Cv4vnSqasdDN3fmVii6SMedjg2deD1SnKkMcVa3juPx3HGxCFTMnitX4y2YSKYbT9DGeKHxYHkLxjH1W9R5YdRYEPbLHPRblockology                       1Cv4vnSqasdDN3fmVii6SMedjg2deD1SnKkMcVa3juPx3HGxCFTMnitX4y2YSKYbT9DGeKHxYHkLxjH1W9R5YdRYEPbLHPR Not likely. No FPGA that I know of has the internal memory for the scratchpad, and if you're going to use external RAM chips, you'll basically have to reinvent a GPU to match the memory access speeds.Even Monero and Aeon don't have FPGA miners (as far as I know), and they only use a couple of MB of memory, vs. 100+ MB for BBR. In fact, they are more efficient on CPUs than GPUs, because at that size you can use the higher-level caches of decent CPUs.Scrypt of Litecoin ended up with FPGA and later ASIC miners only because the memory usage could be compensated with extra computational work. It's like generating bits of the scratchpad as you need them from a smaller amount of data, instead of storing all of it in advance. Unfortunately, that won't work with BBR, because the scratchpad comes from the blockchain itself.Disclaimer: I developed some FPGA and GPU miners back in the day. It's irony, I'm trying to debunk some of the common arguments for name change. It's a childish name for a high tech product, just like "google" or "twitter".It has a weird technical term "bool", just like "bit" in Bitcoin.The "berry" part is just unbearable in a respectable, established brand, just like "burberry". Sorry, this is on my local network only, no public server available. I'm basically solo mining with a local pool, as it's not feasible to run the full OpenCL node on every machine. Thanks, it's working now  There was only a small complaint about missing bignum.node upon startup, but that was an easy thing to fix with "npm install bignum". Please do Today I got desperate enough to try and set up a local pool, but it's not working out. There's always a problem installing the multi-hashing module, which seems to be a common issue. My patience is running out with these new fangled modular systems -- I miss the days when I was developing miners from scratch As BBR is gaining new traction, one can hope that more pools will spring up. It would signify a healthy ecosystem -- the current situation is looking too fragile for a long term investment. Speaking of solo mining, does anyone know a way to connect external miners to the daemon? The OpenCL solo miner/daemon hasn't been updated in a while, and it won't compile with modern library versions (probably Boost being the main culprit). Besides, it's rather redundant to have a separate daemon for each rig.The external miners are intended for pools, and there's no obvious way to connect them to the main daemon (like http getwork via the usual RPC port in Bitcoin-based coins). Of course, this is also a problem with many other coins, but that doesn't make it any better. Some driver versions may fail. Here's what I have currently working with those same cards on Gentoo Linux:dev-util/nvidia-cuda-toolkit 7.5.18-r2x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers 367.35-r1However, I've found that the OpenCL miner is better -- same speed with less CPU load.
My current peers:Code:192.99.32.136110.80.1.250188.27.184.8195.93.239.31158.69.27.82188.4.44.32109.120.49.97211.149.194.156182.71.181.102192.99.32.136211.149.194.156125.25.81.5178.26.208.109Not listing my own as I'm in the middle of a resync. Peer listing provided by (shameless plug) bittools. Somewhat off topic, but this might be interesting for the prime gap crowd:http://bit-player.org/2016/prime-after-prime I just tell people that I work in drug trade, money laundering, tax dodging and pyramid schemes. That saves them the trouble. Sorry about the delay. There's no particular config for BBR on this card, besides the frequencies -- I used 1000 MHz for both GPU core and video memory. It's hard to say anything about the problems you describe, especially as I don't have my 5870 any more. Which Keccak? BBR uses a variant called Wild Keccak which needs plenty of memory, with the current scratchpad size being around 150 MB, and increasing. Good luck trying to fit that on an ASIC. I just noticed mijansky's earlier post so I deleted my reply -- apparently it doesn't work the same way for everyone. On my Linux installs, you can generally killall -9 boolbd, and be left with an older copy of the blockchain. It is something like one day old, so you don't need to sync a large portion. I've also waited for poolto.be payments for about a week. It was only a day's mining though, as I switched to other pools that actually work. These guys should know, they've been developing a proof-of-stake Cryptonote coin for a while:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=887482.0 The common perception of inflation means a steady percentage increase in the money supply per year, in other words an exponential increase. Blakecoin only inflates linearly, meaning the % growth gets smaller every year, and in the long run it won't make a perceptible difference.If people were rational about money, even Bitcoin could have such a linear inflation without too much fuss. However, some people seem entrenched by the idea of a permanently limited supply, as if they were planning to keep their savings in the coin for hundreds of years. Meanwhile, most people aren't thinking long term enough to care about fiat inflation. A linear inflation might provide a sensible middle ground. It's easy to change in the source. Look for "64<<20" in miner.h -- it means 64*2^20 so incrementing the 20 will have the most effect. For exampleCode:sed -Ei 's/64<<20/64<<24/' miner.h Every exchange of every cryptocoin I've used, tells you to not mine directly into your deposit address. They probably have good reasons for it. So I see your "how?" and I raise a "why?". Try both and see which one is faster. I found multistep slower on all my GPUs. At that time, the block reward was 50 BTC. 8 GB per 10 min is about 100 Mbit/s, which is currently available for residential customers in lots of places, using VDSL2 or cable for example. Of course you'll have more traffic in practice, but that gives a reasonable order of magnitude. By the time of such block size, technology will have improved even further. Besides, the numbers are upper limits, the blocks need not be filled to the brim, but provide enough capacity for the rush hours.As others have already said, running a node has never been free. Personally, I've found it's the advances in mining that have made Bitcoin more centralized, i.e. less attractive for the hobbyist developer. For example, when the first GPU miners came about in 2010, people including Satoshi talked about breaking a gentlemanly agreement. Mining was obviously more centralized to those with more hardware and money, but it was still fair game for all. Soon we were developing the first FPGA miners which was great fun. However, the next stage was ASICs which leaves little room for the humble developer. You just buy the device from some faceless company and use it -- or if you have more money, you buy more of them and further centralize things.Nevertheless, it all has made the network stronger for everyone, and everyone is still free to use it. I guess many others feel the same basic dilemma about lots of things: should it stay as a fun hobby project, or should it grow into a serious business? Skype was proprietary to begin with. It uses p2p techniques to relieve network congestion, but it was never p2p in the sense of an open-source grassroots movement. World peace Please read my post again, especially the note where miners can still decide whether or not to accept transactions. This is how Bitcoin is working already.If your supply is higher than demand, it doesn't mean you give everything away for free, you can still set your price.I should also mention that BIP 101 allows for miners to set soft limits on the blocksize, i.e. smaller than the hard limit of 1 MB/ 8MB / 8GB or whatever. I don't see how the block size increase would end transaction fees. First of all, miners have the power to accept transactions based on fees, no matter what the block size limit. Second, if you want Bitcoin to grow more mainstream, you'll want more capacity for transactions per second, and hence larger blocks.However, there are good reasons to limit the block size, and the various plans to increase it are very moderate and controlled. BIP 101 suggests an eightfold increase for starters, and then doubling annually. If you want Bitcoin to go mainstream, you'll probably want more than 8x increase from current usage.Please note, I'm only talking about block size limit, and not the XT client. If we're deciding on the future of Bitcoin, it's much better to handle one well-defined issue at a time, rather than shove a bunch of shady features down our throats. I have this totally neat business idea. Please send 1 BTC to 1GUY1JARacUYPiQedB5e5u4rz7KXnysmJz and I will share it. Any idea on the latest issues? The rewards have been piling up without payment for a few days.
EXCL is bigger and more important than BTC? Sounds like the same variance issues that every solo miner on every coin will experience. The variance will sort itself out over time; if you don't like waiting too long, there is always pooled mining. So the original name of the cereal is Booberry? This reminds me of the Finnish phrase "paskanmarjat" meaning basically "bullshit", but a more literal translation would be "pooberries". Yup, filed the support ticket and waiting. It's happened before, so I'm quite confident it'll work out. One reason being that the closed AMD miner is tied to that pool? It's worse than simply being closed source. This. When I got started with Bitcoin, 1 BTC was less than 10 cents. I remember three major crashes, first to 2 EUR, then 100 EUR, then 400 EUR, so I'm kind of looking forward to the next crash. If you cannot think long term and/or see the big picture, then better stay out of any kind of investment.To paraphrase Mr. H. J. Simpson: Coin goes up, coin goes down. Coin goes up, coin goes down. Hehehehehehehehehe. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6eIBE7Bo3U I thought it was common wisdom to (a) only mine to addresses you control, and (b) not mine directly to exchanges, so as not to overload their servers. I build my own Linux wallets, and I keep getting this error whenever I try to _restart_ the daemon:Code:ExclusiveCoind: kernel.cpp:372: unsigned int GetStakeModifierChecksum(const CBlockIndex*): Assertion `pindex->pprev || pindex->GetBlockHash() == (!fTestNet ? hashGenesisBlock : hashGenesisBlockTestNet)' failed.I can get it started if I delete the block database, but obviously it's not a great idea to download the blockchain upon every update/reboot. I built the Linux daemon, and there's something weird about the port numbers. There's this if I start it with default ports:Code:Error: An error occurred while setting up the RPC port 12007 for listening on IPv4: bind: Address already in useOf course, I checked that no other process is using that port, so it's something about lithiumd.Setting either port=12005 or rpcport=12005 works. It seems the daemon is trying to use 12007 for both network and RPC by default, rather than 12000 and 12007. The Ztex consumes at most 40 W with Blake, probably a little less. The efficiency is easily better than any GPU. Thanks, nice to know BTW, the send happened around a time of network outages, my service was seriously laggy for several hours. However, other coins/miners did not seem to suffer. There was nothing out of the ordinary. However, I then restarted the daemon, and it seems like things have been reset: listtransactions now shows it with -1 confirmations, getrawtransaction no longer finds the tx, and balance of the sending address is back to the pre-send level. Any ideas on a transaction that doesn't get through? No confirmations, and the block explorer shows nothing with the txid or address. I sent it several hours ago. The machine is behind NAT, but it's synced fine as I do receive payments. Argh, that suprnova pool seems completely out of sync, when you look at the block height   I just started testing it, seems like I'm the only one there now. Would appreciate others to join the fight against centralization  Fixed that for you  Also, as I hinted in the main BBR thread, I suggest "Farn". Because every single creation of Zoidberg's is at least one Farn's worth. And that if anything is good news, everyone.(I'll get my coat too, but don't forget to tip the veal, and try the waitress.) First of all, I voted for keeping Boolberry, not because it's the most perfect name, but mostly because a name change comes with all kinds of issues.IMHO, names like Breeze and Rune are way too generic. They're not quite the factual-boring of Word or Windows, but they lack any edge, they are not very memorable for this context. Even Bitcoin works in a breeze compared to traditional money transfer methods, and it has its built-in scripting (runes).Psst or pzzt is a little more interesting, reminds me of ssh - which is equally descriptive, but also a proper abbreviation in the grand hacker tradition. However, it is also somewhat generic for anonymous coins.Boolberry is this odd little name that doesn't mean anything that already exists, so it can stand on its own. It's not dead if you can still buy the socks... can you?  
Not a bad idea. At least one Farn's worth. This. IMHO, the new name doesn't really matter, it's the name change itself that is the problem. It gives the message "we're not sure what we're doing, maybe we'll change the name again next week, for the great joy of exchanges and other related services." What a way to give long-term confidence to an alternative money.Boolberry is not a perfect name. However, any new name would face the same risk "this isn't good enough, we need to rebrand." We've had just enough time to spread the good name of Boolberry, and now we'd have to start all over again for nothing. Speaking of which, "Google" is a totally childish name, the company will never fly. The same goes for Twitter and whatever today's hottest antisocial media is called. They really should have named the search engine something like "secore" for "search core", in the same way that "Word" is a word processor for serious businessmen in dark suits. The real world is not fun, and dealing with money in particular is dead serious business  IMHO, anonymity is like computer security in general, meaning there is no easy solution in the form of a single package. With the way most people trust the computers they don't really own and put their data on The Cloud, it doesn't help if one of their applications does decent privacy. For example, people who use a closed-source miner with a supposedly anonymous coin take facepalming to a whole new level.Conversely, good old Bitcoin is fine for anonymous purposes if you know what you're doing. For most people, extra anonymity is just a buzzword, something to distinguish the altcoin of the day from the coin polloi.Besides, the success of Bitcoin is largely due to convenience -- no contracts/fees with third parties to worry about. Yet it is still not quite mainstream. Anonymity doesn't sell quite in the same way as convenience. For AMD GPUs on Linux, you can tune the frequencies with aticonfig, which comes with the drivers.For voltages there are at least two ways. There's the ADL library, which is used by some cgminer versions and others -- it generally needs to be built into applications. I prefer to use AMDOverdriveCtrl manually on the command line, though it has a GUI by default. For pools you should use one of the Stratum miners, which are completely separate packages, see the first post. I've been mining happily with a 5870 at 1 GHz. The algo is easy on the GPU, so high freqs are generally OK. The rate is about 585 khash/s. Ditto. I would really like to continue solo mining.Is it possible to connect external GPU miners to the official client, as is commonly done in Bitcoin-derived coins? Try driving a Fiat from Europe to America in 10 minutes, with just a drop of fuel. If all you can think of is Superman, then better stay away from all cryptocurrencies. This. Just wanted to highlight it, as the debate is heating up and people will miss a lot of earlier action. Time for a poll? I guess most exchanges do a check for valid addresses, and it's easier when it has a fixed length and a known beginning. Treat your currencies with respect. Only pump and dump people. Wee-wee-coin, as it's not a shitcoin  Nice. I only skimmed through the paper, but even without thorough analysis you can guess that X11 wasn't exactly designed for cryptographic security The way I see it intuitively is that each of the 11 functions is a non-injective mapping (many-to-fewer), basically by the definition of a hash. So when you feed one hash to the next function, you get a many-to-very-few mapping, i.e. much more potential for collisions.Also, if you find a collision for the first function, it just carries over to the end. So if you want to hedge your bets, you need some other combination besides this linear chain. There doesn't seem to be any cryptographic design behind X11 etc., they just wanted a new PoW function for a temporary monopoly. While PoW isn't about exact collisions, they probably go hand in hand -- you're looking for a partial collision with that row of zeros.(Temporary ASIC resistance is often mentioned. If X11 is truly ASIC resistant, then surely there's no need to develop X13 and the like. OTOH, if there's an X11 ASIC, then it won't be that hard to make an X13 ASIC.)Hence I think most coins with new hashes are just a waste of resources. Making hashes particularly slow like Scrypt and Cryptonight is just annoying when updating a wallet. This is one area where Blake wins.As for papers on hashes, here's a less mathematical one: Boolberry's fast but memory-hard algo. This. Reminds me of a tech startup where I was involved in 2000. The name had been chosen from the available 5-letter .com domains -- all 4-letter ones were already reserved. For every possible name, there's always a person who finds it offensive, or another language where it means something nasty. You can't appease to everyone with any single name. A good product will eventually win despite a sub-optimal name, unless it's something obviously negative like "shitcoin". (Or maybe "shitcoin" would win just because it's so daring, and because "it's the shit". If you ever release "shitcoin", don't forget to reward me with a 1% premine )To me, the problem with "Cryptonite" is the confusion with Cryptonote coins, most of which use the Cryptonight PoW algo. It doesn't help that the reward scheme is copied from Cryptonote, and that yet another hash function had to be created.It's the mini-blockchain tech that really counts here. It doesn't need fancy names or hashes to succeed. If XCN doesn't make it to the moon, I hope some other coin will pick up the mini-blockchain.IMHO, the name "Cryptonite" itself is fine, there's no point in changing it any more. And why not have world peace and ponies while he's at it? If you refer to the Cryptonight hash that most Cryptonote coins use, it's a combination of a few different hash/encryption functions and it needs a couple of megs of fast cache. It might fit on one of those big-ass FPGAs that cost thousands apiece. Conversely, Blake is a single, relatively simple hash, which is why it's great for practical FPGA implementations. And as BlueDragon747 already pointed out, even that hasn't been quite trivial.In the software world, it's easy to make bigger and bigger programs for the same CPU/GPU, as long as you have more memory. The CPU is only running a small part of the program at any single time. This is why we've seen crazy PoW solutions like X11/13/15. But when you're doing something in hardware, as in FPGA, you basically have to fit everything on the chip at once. That's why FPGA/ASIC projects run into hard limits more easily than software ones. Thanks, this is starting to make a lot of sense 
Cheers The reward formula is still a bit of a mystery, though. SolvingCode:reward = (2^64 - coins_so_far) * constantgives a nice exponential formula for the reward as a function of height, but I'd rather use the coinbase to account for the large block penalty and whatnot. A couple of brief technical issues:The backupwallet RPC does not work on the daemon on my Linux box. It could be a botched build on my part, but it generally works on all other Bitcoin derivatives I've tried (about 20 of them), and the rest of cryptonited works fine. The log showsCode:2014-08-28 18:10:33 copied wallet.dat to /home/teknohog/test.datbut there is no file to be found.Also, is there an RPC for finding the current total XCN out there? In some coins you can find it as "moneysupply" in getinfo. Good points-- something to consider in the future, but this won't help with the current situation. Personally, I'm fine with the lost trades, if the balances are restored according to each blockchain. For me, GPU mining is somewhat profitable. Not much for making a living, but it means I should rather mine than buy in preparation for world domination. I think his argument was that all the electrons in the universe can be seen as manifestations of one single electron. You'd still need other particles.The idea is that a positron (anti-electron) is mathematically equal to an electron moving backwards in time. A single electron, whizzing to and fro in space and time, could explain all the electrons and positrons in existence. It also ties in neatly with the balance of matter and antimatter -- you can turn a photon into an electron-positron pair or vice versa, but never a single electron or positron.However, it's more like a fun way of looking at things, rather than a physical theory, as it doesn't give any new predictions over the Standard Model. Nevertheless, you can still see its influence in Feynman diagrams. Bitcoin was released in 2009. I got onboard in mid-2010 and the price at that time was more like 100 BTC per pizza (Here, 1 pizza is around 5 euros). IMHO, Boolberry fits right in with the semi-childish names of tech giants like Google, Twitter, Apple.... and Blackberry. I'm sure these names were chosen to reflect our new, more playful times, as a clean break from the dead serious corporate images of portly men in dark suits. Let Monero have its suits, we have all the fun. USD is inflationary. Throwing all these dreamy BTC/USD rates around doesn't help if/when USD itself is crashing. Maybe we'll live to see the $10000 pizza, but hopefully by that time we'll be all using better currencies (not necessarily BTC). Awesome! I've been reading enough about how the GTX 750 Ti makes its owner rich and handsome after bringing peace to Middle East, but I've been worried about the closed/private miner issue. I might actually give Nvidia a chance, though I still think AMD plays better with the open source ecosystem. Good thing you didn't lose any GPU time   Copy the new kernel in the same directory with the binaries (and the old kernels). Change the kernel name in miner_conf.json to the new one.If you have a thread_delay of 2000 or so in miner_conf.json, there's probably not much more to do. It is typical to have a big variance when solo mining -- sometimes you find two blocks in a short time, sometimes there's a long dry season.Also, you can probably increase the GPU frequencies from normal. This algorithm is very easy on GPUs, so there is less danger of overheating. RAM speeds are not very important for this.No need to change it. The GPU miner will find shares at the low difficulty, but the network only counts blocks with its own difficulty. Having those low-diff shares is good for checking your GPU works, and calculating the hash rate. A single Radeon 7970 gets a block every 2...3 days. Not exactly a big rig. I'm now getting about 1 H/s which is nowhere close to CPU speeds, so I'm not going to wait for shares now.Stupid question about design: are you returning the full result to the CPU for testing against difficulty? Because most GPU miners do an initial test on the GPU, which makes communication a lot faster, and they only return the gid/nonce when necessary. It looks like you're not using the gid... I removed all those (ulong *)'s as I figured there's no need for type conversion, they're already defined with that type. It compiles and runs on my AMD system, clearly hashing something.Unfortunately, my first GPU is a very slow, integrated one, so I'd like a way to force the second device...Edit: one obvious compile issue was fixed by adding -std=gnu99 to CFLAGS. The compiler even suggest either that or -std=c99, but it also hints at GNU extensions, and indeed only the gnu99 worked. (This is probably included by default, but got messed by custom flags :-j) Yup, this was on AMD. I'll have a look at those type conversions at some point. Compiled and got this upon running:Code:clBuildProgram() returned -11!"/tmp/OCL25634T8.cl", line 366: error: invalid type conversion                AES256Round((uint *)c, (ulong *)&long_state[aindx],                (uint *)a);                                       ^"/tmp/OCL25634T8.cl", line 368: error: invalid type conversion                CopyBlock((ulong *)&long_state[aindx], b);                          ^"/tmp/OCL25634T8.cl", line 372: error: invalid type conversion                CopyBlock(b2, (ulong *)&long_state[cindx]);                              ^"/tmp/OCL25634T8.cl", line 377: error: invalid type conversion                CopyBlock((ulong *)&long_state[cindx], a);                          ^"/tmp/OCL25634T8.cl", line 325: warning: variable "gid" was declaredbut never          referenced        __private uint i, j, gid, aeskey1[64], aeskey2[64];                             ^4 errors detected in the compilation of "/tmp/OCL25634T8.cl".Frontend phase failed compilation.Looks like pretty minor errors, but I have no time to hack on this now. Yup. Well, you can still GPU mine it like there's no tomorrow  I haven't really factored in mining equipment, but as for ongoing profitability ratio (gross returns per electric bill), Blake on FPGAs is better than anything I've come across. With my current electricity prices, the ratio is over 10, while it would be about 4 for Bitcoin on ASICs. While this depends on your local prices, it won't change the relative position between these.(BTW, props on your choice of avatar -- not that I'd ever use a celebrity face myself ) I think open source is a fact. It's just that I like to highlight different facts Good points, this is partly why I started with a rather historical note on this debate, I don't know current hardware that well.In fact, one of my other interests with GPUs is the search for Mersenne primes, and I know Nvidia shines in that application. It's just that I'd never buy computer hardware for a single purpose, especially given the open source stance.....but if you can afford it, good or you BTW, my next major hardware purchase will likely be a Kaveri APU -- I basically need a new CPU/motherboard, but I'm also intrigued by the shared L3 cache between CPU and GPU. It should be great for GPU applications that need a large, fast cache... What's wrong with Atomic-trade?
My HD 5870 is getting around 550 khash/s. I've been trying to sell at least one of these oldies, but they're still great with certain algos.As for the AMD/Nvidia question, the following will probably sound like a flamebait or fanboy speak, but that is not my intention.When opensource GPU miners for Bitcoin first came out in the autumn of 2010, AMD was the obvious choice due to their better integer performance. Some of the current reputation probably stems from this, even though both GPU makers have changed a lot since then.It is also worth noting that AMD is focused on OpenCL, instead of designing and promoting a proprietary language. Nvidia has CUDA meaning they usually give their best performance using that language, although they also support OpenCL.The third, possibly irrelevant point is that AMD supports open source driver development, by releasing hardware specs for developers of Linux, Xorg and the like. This is not immediately important, because at the moment you need the closed-source drivers to get the best OpenCL performance. However, some people care about these things a lot. Chances are that after 5-10 years the opensource driver is the only way to use a GPU you buy today -- it's happened before.This also ties in with the fact how AMD prefers an open standard language rather than a proprietary one. So if you think long term and care about open source / open standards, the choice is obvious.(As for the fanboy section, AMD is the little guy that could. They developed the 64-bit extensions to x86, for example. This is somewhat relevant to a potential rant concerning 32-bit releases, but not now ) Having set up solo mining, I have a question about making an alias. While I can issue the make_alias command, do I need to give it every time when restarting the daemon? Is it saved automatically, or is there a way to save it? Get out while you can. Has anyone actually got a PoS block? What, no backups? No way to access the hard drive? Such as fractional reserve banking, stock market, bureaucracy, and spouting eternal wisdom on teh intarwebz. Been wondering the same. I checked EU3 which is my primary pool, and I don't see anything unusual, except the low balances, which don't seem to fill up for sending any time soon. To me that counts as computing. Projects like SETI@Home and Distributed.net have held the title at some point, and they are not doing general computation either. Record supercomputers often have a mix of CPUs and GPUs that, while programmable for anything, are not necessarily optimal/fastest for every possible computation.Also, mmmm....Guinness.... It seems to pick up the number of CPUs by itself, so you don't really need the -t option.(I generally use -t `nproc` for all the various cpuminers, because some of them either don't pick it up, or assume things about hyperthreading and AES-NI that don't apply to everyone. Of course try different numbers, but usually the default is the best.) Great to hear from you! Thanks for all your work, and congratulations!  Ouch. It's rather common that FPGAs are slower than GPUs but more power efficient, but this is a bit too far from practical.GPUs run at about 1 GHz, which is way less than current CPUs. They just have so many cores/threads running in parallel. They also have more/faster memory than common FPGA boards. (Though I wonder if the SRAM of DE2-115 could be put to good use...)When I hacked together my first FPGA code, I didn't really know/care about timing (and I'm not much wiser today ). The suggested speed limit was about 70 MHz, but the Spartan 3E didn't have the flexibility of the Cyclone IV clocking, so I just built 50 and 100 MHz versions, and they were both fine. Sure, you'll get the occasional error, but the overall efficiency is better with a little overclocking. Ztex boards/miners make great use of this idea by dynamic clocking based on error rate.Offtopic: Keccak is supposed to be really hardware-friendly, so it could be fine even without full unrolling. Opencores has an implementation, but their login systems is having some issues... I'd really like to know what you can do with this coin. If you can answer that, then there's your anti-shitcoin argument. I wouldn't call this coin shit, but technical viability is not enough, you need services, exchanges and all that.For a fun anecdote, "TJ" has a special meaning for young men in Finland. We have military conscription, and the main service lasts for 6 to 12 months. Guys under service are eager to count down how many days they have left. They say "TJ 72" for "72 (days) left today". (tänään = today, jäljellä = left)So my problem is, I now have more TJ than I have days left on the Earth. What should I do with them? Works  4.04 Mhash/s per 7970 on Linux, using -k x11mod -I 20, core/mem freq 1050/1500, ati-drivers 14.6_beta1. More importantly, where are we now with this coin? What are you guys doing with it?So far, I've only managed to sell a tiny bit of them at ecoinfund, before they closed it  and I cannot find anything else to do with it, as my Chinese is not very fluent. (我的汉语不好, or something.) I think I already did that, with my single GPU easily doing a 51% Oh, you mean maintaining I think I might be able to do some technical maintenance. It might be interesting to learn the ins and outs, as it helps to understand other Bitcoin-derived coins; I don't really code all that much, and for coins, I've only done some miners and helper scripts -- not the actual client/network stuff. (I'm a physicist/math student, and I like low level algorithm/logic stuff )In fact, I've never even used the Qt clients of any coins, just the commandline daemon with my own scripts. I could probably learn to code the Qt side too, but then there are Windows ans OSX clients too...Also, I'm not much into all the community stuff, promotion etc. that goes with maintaining a coin.All in all, I think can be there for (some of) the technical stuff, but I can't exactly see myself as the sole project leader. It's great to see that my GPU miner effort was not wasted and the coin is still alive, but I don't have any grand plan to go on with, besides basic bugfixes.So let's at least keep the discussion alive. Where shall we take this coin (apart from the Moon)? See the post right before yours  To build this under Linux, do something like thisCode:git clone https://github.com/teknohog/sph-sgminercd sph-sgminer./autogen.sh./configuremake -j2and for usage see my earlier post and/or https://github.com/teknohog/sph-sgminer/blob/master/doc/primio.mdI don't know what to do with other OSes, but there are plenty of people here who build the binaries, it's all from the same sources. Sounds awesome. I especially like the part of doing part-time work. There are so many unemployed people, and so many people toiling long hours, we should try to distribute it more evenly.Although there's nothing inherently wrong with unemployment either. It tells us that the engine we call society is now more fuel-efficient. Kind of.A year and a half ago, I quit my day job which had made my life miserable. I had enough savings to live on for a year or two, plus a nice stash of Bitcoins, but nothing to retire on. I just wanted to focus on the fun things, which for me were studying more math and doing art, like music and theatre.Going back to school was essential for me for a couple of reasons, besides enjoying the subject. I wanted some kind of daily (or at least weekly) schedule to stay productive, and I also had professional reasons to improve my qualifications. When people ask me what I do, I can tell them I'm a student, and I have a good reason for being one in my age.In fact, for many years, I have been questioning the way people expect you to have a well-defined job that defines what you are, vs. leisure time for doing something essentially useless. I am considering my current situation as a social experiment, and I understand that people need places and times to go and do things, in order to stay sane and productive. I have basically turned this upside down, by doing art projects with other people, occasionally involving long hours and "business trips", and then do some trading and coding in my free time.I was really just thinking of a gap year or two, but given the way Bitcoin has developed over the time, I'm not sure if I ever go back to work -- though running a small business might be a nice option to organize all the fun. I'm getting a similar error withCode:JSON decode rpc2_getscratchpad response failed(1): premature end of inputThe weird thing is that this only happens on one of two machines, which are not fundamentally very different. Both are behind the same NAT, although this one is behind an extra switch. The other machine is doing fine, finding shares all the time.
I thought it would be a good idea to change the address, so you can look up your shares. So far there's nothing from my machine... or is this part not implemented yet? Edited, works  I was primarily paraphrasing a movie, though not Event Horizon Secondarily, about solar, nuclear, wind and wave power, and so on. We will run out of oil sooner or later, let the old money fight for it with their debt-based dollars, while a new generation moves on to a brighter future. Where we're going... we don't need oil.   Perhaps encrypt one of the hashes with DES, using the other hash as the key?We could also add a huge number of rot13 stages to make hashing extra hard  Another name I thought up was "RetroHash", but I see it is already taken, though not in a crypto context. I can't believe there isn't a Midascoin already. I'm half seriously thinking of a MiDa5coin to go with this algo. Maybe MD5 + SHA1 to stay retro while adding to perceived security. I'm not going to launch/maintain a coin by myself, just thinking of some low hanging GPU fruit  How is this profitable? I'm seeing prices of 1 Litoshi, which makes this just about break even. *sigh* talk about a day late and a dollar short... with my GPU kernel already released last week, and it only needed a small fix:https://github.com/teknohog/sph-sgminer Damn, I have such great timing! I found this thread while looking for coins that use the JH hash. I just released a GPU miner for Primio (JH-256) last week.From ocean.cpp it looks like this is also standard JH-256, so I tried one of the pools. It didn't work at first, but it only took a small modification (exposed as the --tjcoin option).So now I have a working GPU miner, one day late from the bounty:https://github.com/teknohog/sph-sgminerJust use the primio kernel, with the extra option --tjcoin. For the pools, you'll also need "--difficulty-multiplier 0.0000152587890625".If anyone would still like to donate me some coin, use some of the coins/addresses here. (I don't even have a working Tjcoin wallet yet -- the unix makefile still refers to litecoin, but I think that can be fixed )Edit: wallet compiled, donations welcome at JK9zKzpbEsqqKUpghA9jKRHtFMMPVDtJtr Edit: For the yesmm pool, difficulty multiplier 1/65536 = 1.52587890625e-05 = 0.0000152587890625 seems to work. This might vary by the pool, another common number is 1/256. Setting the multiplier too high will still get your shares accepted, but you miss a lot of potential, lower shares.Yet another edit: As seen in the Primio post, I get about 40 Mhash/s on a 5870, and 65 on a 7970. Also, I don't do Windows, so don't ask me about it -- I'm sure someone else can compile the binaries, this is just another (sph-)sgminer fork. hiring a hitman I just changed "daemon" into "simpleminer" in the above (you can find both targets in the Makefile). This is what dynamic intensity is for. You can set this in the running miner by pressing G, I and D (in case of a single GPU) or G, I, 2, D for GPU #2. Alternatively, use "d" instead of the intensity number in your config.IMHO, it's better to keep a fixed, high intensity otherwise, but you can set it to dynamic for the movie, and then back. A GPU miner.I was bored for a few days, and I wanted to try my hand at this OpenCL thingy. Just in time to honour the Midsummer celebrations, here it is:https://github.com/teknohog/sph-sgminerUse the "primio" kernel, a high intensity like 20, high core freq, and low memory clock. This is a standard JH-256 implementation, so it might come in handy for future coins using the same hash.For the nicemining pool, you will also need "--difficulty-multiplier 0.00390625".Rough speed examples:5870: 40 Mhash/s7970: 65 Mhash/sIf you like my work, consider a donation in Primio to PCX2iRtiWYyUebjvhyfQiEsVyashiA559Q or any of the other coins/addresses listed on my homepage. As one of the early Bitcoin FPGA devs, I say go for it!  You won't swamp the network rate for a couple of reasons any time soon. FPGAs are generally slower than GPUs, and relatively expensive -- fewer people have them (think about the average gamer with a strong GPU, vs. the average electronics hobbyist with an FPGA).It's only power efficiency where FPGAs win in the long run, and this requires wider adoption. In the case of Bitcoin, FPGA miners paved the way to ASICs, and it was only those that really took GPUs out of the business. At the moment, Blakecoin (and its mergemine coins) have had FPGA miners for some time already, but GPU mining is still somewhat profitable. Of course, the low power consumption is a personal gain for any miner As for the tech specs -- in any coin, hash.h tells you how the algos are chained up, in this case it's 640-bit data -> Skein -> 512-bit hash -> SHA2 -> final 256-bit hash.Do have a look at other FPGA projects like the Blakecoin one for examples. Also, I cannot help but link my own -- the Python mining script might still serve as a simple example on how everything works together. I thought it is standard Unix style to reserve ports below 1024 for root. I know it doesn't really help with security (and there are ways to run a server as a user, after opening the port as a root), but why choose a low number for this coin, of all cryptocurrencies?Actually, I don't really see this as a problem -- having to choose your port number before running the server might make you a little more aware of network issues. OTOH, is there any downside for the network when clients have lots of different ports, for example in discovering new nodes? Not if somebody buys them at 0.00002750 BTC each at Atomic-trade. Simpleminer is included in the main Boolberry sources. I'm not sure how to compile it separately, but if you simply "make" the sources, you'll find simpleminer among the other binaries under build/release/src/. I also thought my 5870s are producing twice the expected hashrate. It turned out the cgminer was "seeing double", and the actual speed was confirmed by pools. In all the Bitcoin derivatives I know, hasherpersec refers to the wallet's internal CPU miner only. The wallet cannot know how fast the GPUs are hashing. Even pools can only estimate the hashrate based on the frequency of shares. So for mining calculations, you need to manually add up your actual hashrate. Nope, just cloned it today.. but I managed to compile it now, using plain gcc -- I generally use ccache and distcc, and for some reason they resulted in the above error.
Any particular tricks you used? I'm getting an errorCode:minerd-util.o: In function `sleep10':util.c:(.text+0x3c0): multiple definition of `sleep10'minerd-cpu-miner.o:cpu-miner.c:(.text+0x2ac0): first defined here Donate to an open source hardware project. My favourite would be the Neo900; the world needs a decent open source phone with a keyboard (wtf is it with touchscreens now that phones are used more for typing than talking?) GRS Wow, I didn't know anyone actually reads my homepages  That one is a particularly old one (and admittedly messy). I may have been a little unclear -- the Linux kernel (and several distributions) runs on PowerPC and many other big-endian platforms, even though the first releases were heavily tied to x86. Porting an application would seem much easier, though there is probably little interest. X86 is everywhere, and most mobile platforms are little-endian ARM. (I've succesfully compiled and run bitcoind on several rather low-end ARM machines.) I'm not sure about that particular problem, but direct getwork to pools is hardly supported/recommended anywhere. I have a version that works with cgminer 3.1.1 so you can use any Stratum pool:https://github.com/teknohog/Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner/tree/master/projects/DE2_115_makomk_serial_109mhz_cgminer Having the mainline *coin daemon portable to big-endian machines would be hugely interesting, but also a ton of work. The code is so full of little-endian assumptions it's not funny; there is hope in the example of Linux which was first written as a limited, personal project on an i386, but now it runs on practically every architecture out there. (Vint Cerf is the key developer of TCP/IP) Rehashing (pun intended) my generic answer to these questions...There were SHA-2 ASICs way, way before the first Bitcoin mining ASICs. They were not suitable for mining due to I/O limitations: you'd have to push a relatively big load of data for each single hash, and the chips were not fast enough for that. What mining ASICs do is generate most of the data on the fly (by incrementing the nonce) so there is no I/O bottleneck, in addition to the actual hashing. However, the nonce business is easy, so if you can implement the hash, making a miner is only a matter of time and financial sense. Slashdot had an article on Bitcoin 0.3 (?) release in July 2010. The only miner was the client, there was no way to connect external miners, the getwork protocol only came up later that year with the idea of GPUs and pools. I mined 7 blocks on a Core 2 Duo and sold them for 24.50 EUR. Good times! There is a wallet for Linux, you can grab the source and compile it yourself. That's the Way of Tux for many of us  Of course it would be nice to have a binary ready to run, but they are generally specific to a single distribution (like Ubuntu), and won't necessarily work on any random Linux. (Then there are architecture issues like x86 vs x86-64 vs ARM -- good luck on a big endian platform like PowerPC...) Nice, I'm getting 188 and 192 MHz with the auto adjust, close to my 1.15y speeds.  I'm afraid you misspelled "hodl". Putting a capital in the middle of a word goes against all sensible spelling rules. We generally understand compound words like grandmother and electromagnetic without using such tricks.The only place where I somewhat tolerate it, is systems like programming languages where you need complex names without spaces, for example FooCounter = InitValue + SomeOtherValue. Even there, you usually have the option to use underscores - or simply rely on the old idea of compound words, like "foocounter" meaning a counter that counts foos.  There were similar SHA-2 chips way before the first FPGA Bitcoin miners. Just because the algorithm is implemented in silicon does not make it suitable for *coin mining. Basically, it's an I/O problem because you need to hash through a lot of data. Dedicated mining chips solve this by generating most of the data themselves, they run the same initial data with different nonces.On the other hand, it's only a matter of time before the ASICs suitable for mining are developed. Even Scrypt has ASICs now, even though it was originally touted as GPU/FPGA/ASIC resistant. It must be common knowledge that the Ztex FPGA frequency adjustment is not perfect, but here's another anecdote. I recently got an original 1.15y board where two of the chips are impossible to run without forced clock limits. Basically, they start giving lots of HW errors at 188 or 192 MHz, and they end up SICK. After setting an upper limit of 184, they run fine, with zero HW errors. It's as if the HW vs. frequency is an extremely steep function for these chips.The board runs SHA-2 code fine at nearly 220 MHz, though the two chips are the slowest of the bunch. I also have other 1.15y/x boards where Blake runs fine with the default adjustment on cgminer 3.1.1To answer a question in the README,I got the freq limits working for two boards usingCode:--ztex-clock 180:184,180:248,180:248,180:184,200:248,200:248,200:248,200:248All in all, this is not a bug report or anything, but an interesting finding. I've tried both of the currently available bitstreams with similar results. Well, we know that Blake was designed to be ASIC friendly. Scrypt was not, and yet there is a lot of action (or at least talk) about a Scrypt ASIC development. So technically, it's not at all unlikely, and it should be relatively easy after the generations of SHA-2 chips already out there.However, it would be a big investment, so it wouldn't make a lot of financial sense at the moment. https://www.cryptsy.com/markets/view/8
HD 5870 at 975 MHz, intensity 11: 114 Mhash/sHD 7970 at 1050 MHz, intensity 11: 213 Mhash/sGPU memory speeds have no noticeable effect so I keep them at the card minimum. Also higher intensities and different worksizes don't seem to make a difference with these cards. The same goes for faster PCIe links, 1x is plenty for these. I don't burn oil to mine coins. I pay a little extra to my power company to invest in renewables like wind power. It seems you have a problem with energy production methods, not cryptocurrencies themselves. Wow, nice  And I mean this in the unix priority sense - the poclbm was hogging my CPU, which might explain why this is considerably faster. Where can I donate? I'd like to see where you can find one that cheap (especially an original one instead of a clone)  My two recent purchases have been closer to 200 EUR each, including postage. The cheapest offers I've seen were about 150, but it seems the prices are on the rise with a certain lucrative application  I compiled and ran this on ARM back in the day (mined two blocks on a Linkstation, FWIW). The main thing to worry about *coin daemons on fringe platforms is endianness, as some of the protocols are stuck on little-endian. I never got a wallet working on a PowerPC but my custom mining script was fine :-j(Rant: hash algorithms, network byte order, and natural number systems are all big endian. The original Bitcoin client/daemon was developed on x86 Windows and it makes all kinds of assumptions and translations with byte order. Banks will never use *coin because big iron is traditionally big endian ) I think the real question is why you'd want to run fanless, if a large and slow fan would be practically inaudible, and improve the speed considerably. Since you have a big heatsink, I assume you've also gotten rid of the tiny, whiny stock fans. (Why anyone would install them in the first place is beyond me - a single 80..120 mm fan would cover all 4 FPGAs quite ideally, keeping the high pressure center away from the heatsinks.)I've built quiet computers with passive and nearly-passive cooling for about 10 years, starting with the same general idea: if I use a big-ass heatsink and a low-power chip, I should not need a fan. The reality is that passive cooling is rather quirky. Even the smallest forced airflow makes a huge difference. It can be hard to get a good natural convection even with chimney-style setups, because the healthy temperatures for chips are so low. IMHO, this feels weird on so many levels. First of all, why use a number that's only valid today when you design something to last years and years.Secondly, with a constant minimum block size, it will be awkward if the rewards just halt at one point (though transaction fees will probably be important at that stage). Bitcoin and many altcoins approach this by gradually decreasing the reward, but I would rather keep it constant for the sake of simplicity. Inflation is not really an issue, because we usually worry about it as the percentage, which would be decreasing every year, approaching zero. https://github.com/Eropi4/cgminer_keccak/I compiled this using --disable-ztex --enable-opencl --disable-adl --enable-keccak and it works fine, 106 Mhash/s on a 5870. We are not amused. It's a perfectly cromulent word. Thanks for all the Copperlark references, found a working GPU cgminer (i.e. builds on Linux like any cgminer) here:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=260708.0 It's not working for me, perhaps it's an issue in this particular Qt build.However, in the meantime I recompiled with better CPU-specific optimizations and restarted with gen=-1and genproclimit=4 in the config, and it now runs with 4 threads. Maybe it was some glitch about detecting 2 actual CPUs vs. 4 (hyper)threads.It's not really essential though, given GPU miners, hence not listed in my urgent issues  A few points this really needs:headless daemon - you're not going to run anything serious on a Qt client?sources for the cgminer, so non-Windows users can join in (again, insert point about headless machines for serious work)Also, I cannot find an obvious way to change the number of CPU mining threads. The client doesn't honour the usual settings in ecoin.conf, such as genproclimit. I'll see if this can be done via RPC, though. Exactly. This is why you use a couple of different exchanges, and don't use any of them for long-term storage.However, I'd rather not open yet another exchange account for BLC only. As others have pointed out, there needs to be something else for a new site to stand out, like a prudent selection of meaningful currencies. This will also help keep the interface clean; one of my favourites is BTC-e, whereas sites like Bter and Cryptsy are just messy. Read this first: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=414777.0In other words, if you don't have the experience/expertise to handle other people's money, better just talk to established exchanges in order for them to adopt BLC. This is exactly what I did a few weeks ago, as I'm also interested in following other developments such as Scrypt on FPGAs. Paid 150 for a bitstream-compatible clone, which I received last week. The speed is closer to 1.5 GH/s but I'm only using the default automatic adjustment, so there might be room for improvement. I'd say it's the only non-sha256 coin you can sensibly* mine with FPGAs.Bitcoin uses sha256, but so do many other coins like Peercoin. Generally, you can use the same hardware for all coins that use the same hash algorithm. There are only a handful of different hash algos, compared to the bazillions of funnycoins and memecoins.*(There are FPGA and ASIC miners being developed for Scrypt (e.g. Litecoin). For example kramble here has done some nice work with FPGAs  However, it's not yet a huge threat to GPU mining -- the nature of Scrypt means that it needs a lot of fast RAM, which FPGAs don't have.) Ah, of course -- it's like a CPU task that only does fixed point math, so there are unused FPU resources. (I guess I was thinking in an FPGA sense where you can allocate all of the silicon to any task.) The comparison to Scrypt is obvious, then. However, I'd expect Blake to use similar GPU resources as sha256 when fully optimized.Also, the 99% figure doesn't mean anything -- you can max out a CPU with an idle loop, for example. Doesn't this just mean that the GPU code has plenty of room for optimization? (If the code is already well optimized, you could at least run the GPU at a higher frequency.)I agree on the statistical points, and I like the idea of an FPGA/ASIC friendly function vs. artificially complicated ones that end up wasting more power. However, I don't see how the efficiency can be meaningfully compared between different functions. Just use the "Ignore" function on the left, no need to feed the troll.
The "contact us" link on the top, support@bter.com.It does sound strange, but I guess they had some technical problems -- CNC deposits were disabled for several days, right after my first attempt of depositing. Just my 2 cents on this experience:Got all my coins back Lost a Blakecoin exchange, hopefully one of the established exchanges will adopt itIt's pointless to blame r3wt specifically, as many big/professional exchanges have been hacked tooDon't keep large amounts of coin in any exchange for a long timeRemember http://xkcd.com/792/ that was apparently referenced in the log  Wow, I had basically forgotten about my CNC loss as the whole thing looked so fishy, but this made me think again. After a few emails with Bter support, I got my CNC back  Please specify things like your OS, AMD APP SDK version, ./configure options and so on. I managed it on Linux with SDK 2.9 and --disable-icarus --disable-adl --enable-opencl. My thoughts exactly  I try to buy only hardware I could learn to program myself, in a spirit of open source. There is also the arms race mentality about ASICs that I have a slight problem with; an early ASIC could soon be obsolete, but you could still develop something revolutionary on an old FPGA, GPU or CPU.That said, I happen to have a BFL FPGA Single. I'm sure there are other people who have also stayed away from the ASIC refund, and it could be a nice engine for Blake. The sha256 performance is similar to a Ztex 1.15y. I recall reading it has two fairly high-end Altera chips, possibly of the Stratix family. (The heatsinks are glued on, so I haven't checked.)If someone can port Blake on this thing, I am willing to donate mine for research. I have a feeling these FPGAs won't be accessible with the free Quartus, and there may be other software/electrical issues to reverse engineer. These guys have an exchange up, I have nothing to do with them except being a satisfied customer:https://openex.pw/ I've tried these, and both 5870s and 7970s are slightly faster with 14. There are the occasional rejects, though, it's hard to say whether they are due to intensity or just the usual issues with pools and networks. Yup, as confirmed by the EU pool, this cgminer is seeing double -- the actual rate is pretty much half of the displayed one for 5870s. OTOH, the display is fine for 7970s. My commandline only hasCode:./cgminer --blake256 -o http://nanite:8772/ -u teknohog -p XXXXX -I 14I have tried different worksizes like -w 128, and not seen much effect. This version of cgminer (kR105's 3.7.2 branch, latest from git) does not allow things like --thread-concurrency that I'm used to tweaking with other coins.I guess I should try this on a pool that can report an effective hashrate, in case this cgminer shows it wrong. It's hard to get a good evaluation from a few day's solo mining. One 5870 is 900,300 and another is 925,925. The memory speeds don't seem to matter, similarly to sha256, but the other card does not allow very low values.The 7970s were clocked to something like 1000,1500 but in fact they pretty well match the 2.2 GH/s from the main post - I probably confused them with the 7990 at first. It's fine, thanks  (Though to be precise, I've never worked with the LX150 -- my main contribution has been serial comms.) Many thanks to all developers here, it has been great to see a new hash algorithm take off, with all the different software and hardware support I've done a little solo mining on GPUs, and today I just found the Ztex 1.15x bitstream which is running great at 140 MHz. Unfortunately I don't have the ISE license for these FPGAs, but I'll try to do whatever testing I can anyway.As another anecdote, both my 5870s are showing about 2.5 Ghash/s each, while 7970s are a little slower than this, all in contrast to the commonly reported figures. These are with kR105's cgminer, SDK 2.9 and ati-drivers 13.12. If you really want to strike gold with primes, try mersenne.org, they give you a few thousand bucks for each new Mersenne prime  I transferred several hundred CNC to Bter today, and there is no sign of them after about 500 confirmations. It's odd how they saysince the lack of fees should affect the confirmations directly.The link to "sync" your deposits into your balance seems a little weird too, there isn't such a manual step in any other exchange I've used.Of course, this isn't exactly my life savings, I simply mined a few blocks for the lulz at some point  All of the above, but I chose "the Party" because of its multiple meanings. bill (from bit + mill and other monetary connotations) It's not exactly universal. In Chinese numerals, there is a standard of 4 orders of magnitude. For example, 1 million translates to Chinese as "bai wan", meaning 100 * 10000. I don't know what they use in Japan, but it's not hard to imagine that something similar is used in neighboring countries. If the distribution of blocks is "totally random" (which, btw, is pretty hard to define in itself) then they won't be coming at equal intervals. Think about the following bit pattern, which would correspond to blocks coming in regularly every 4 days:00010001000100010001000100010001This is obviously not random, at least in the Kolmogorov complexity sense, that you can write a very short program to produce this string of bits.If you move the 1s around to make this more "random", then you're bound to see some clusters of 1s, separated by longer stretches of 0s, with the occasional lone 1. However, if the process behind the bits is "totally random", then there is no particular reason why given 1s would cluster up. Yes, they come in groups, but not necessarily because of any hidden parameters. It's interesting how shorter repetitions are considered lucky patterns, but a more distributed pattern like the one above is not usually noticed, unless you actually keep track over many days.I've thought about this aspect of randomness in many areas of human life. When things are distributed randomly (though uniformly in a large scale), some people are bound to get more than others. This is why some people are considered "lucky", they are just the ones where things cluster up. If you want to eliminate luck, you need a command economy where everyone is forced to have the same amount of everything. The inverse ratios are more interesting, IMHO, since a value of 12 for each step has been discussed before, and it looks about right. The point was partly to illustrate the exponential nature of Primecoin difficulty, but it also enabled mining profitability estimates based on the 5-chain rate. Which seems like ancient history now, after all it's over 2 months since the launch :-j I recently ordered one with the XC7Z020, with no particular application in mind -- for example, it's a relatively cheap devkit for the FPGA only, considering alternatives like the Zedboard. There have been lots of $99 boards with just an ARM-based computer, basically beefed-up Raspis; this one is similar but with an FPGA and the Epiphany coprocessor.I'm guessing the reason it has an FPGA in the first place is a cost-effective way to develop a suitable interconnect for the coprocessor, but in some ways I find the FPGA more interesting in itself As for mining on the FPGA, I hope nobody is seriously expecting any profit with these...
Retracting my offer, as GPUs are now useless for sha256 mining. It depends on what the point is. If you want to make a quick buck, I'm sure there are better ways than volunteering in a math experiment. A lot of people use GPUs to find prime numbers: http://www.mersenneforum.org/forumdisplay.php?f=92 Any software can use AVX if you compile it yourself with a decent compiler.In a precompiled release, it's possible to have separate code paths with such optimizations, but I think such releases are unlikely at this point. AVX is just one technological improvement among others, like the numerous SSE iterations, and it would take dozens of different binaries to cover all possible optimizations. Also, besides the instruction set, there are optimizations for scheduling and cache sizes. Speaking of which, Primecoin performance is apparently sensitive to L1 cache; there are options like sievesize that may be optimized for a given cache size without recompiling.In general, though, if you want something optimized for your particular machine, you need to compile it yourself. You mean programmable logic, like FPGAs? I think the idea actually grew out of memory chips - you can implement basic logic by having memory addresses as the input, and memory contents as the output.It's a nice technology to have, as long as someone can actually program the requisite logic - we still don't have a Scrypt miner on an FPGA. Also, good luck developing a Scrypt ASIC without first prototyping it on an FPGA.OTOH, if you had the ASIC tech for several different hashes, you could in theory have all of them on one chip, but why would you switch between them, instead of running them all at once? Agreed. Looking back, the best financial investment would have been to buy lots of BTC, but there were a lot more fun ways to participate. I've had tons of fun learning to code FPGAs, and some might even consider it a skill worth money. I've generally only bought hardware that the user could program themselves, so that rules out ASICs - as you said, there are plenty of other uses for GPUs, and the same goes for FPGAs.Of course, there have to be people who develop stuff, instead of investing, so this kind of fun aspect is actually quite important even from the financial POV.Some of the altcoins have rekindled the fun to some extent, notably Primecoin from the most recent ones. It's a little sad that a lot of the talk around Primecoin is about hosted mining and profitability, while the math itself is so exciting. Holy Satoshi! I thought this thread was all about VPS providers, rather than the actual technology and the coin  Thanks for getting it back on track  I hope you like my extra warm n' fuzzy address.ANtiXtwsuyzzxgtpfgVAvASaJKwEmAJTCz This reminds me of building bitcoind on ARM machines with 128 MB of RAM. These days primecoind compiles and runs fine on a 256 MB Buffalo Linkstation. Of course, ccache and distcc help a lot.OT: It's nice that cryptocurrencies make people learn unix, but I wonder if there should be separate threads/FAQs about these. After all, the same issues seem to come up every time a new coin is released... You call that low spec? My Atom D510 has found 7 blocks so far, the last one today  AFAIK, there are two reasons why the Lucas-Lehmer test for Mersenne primes has been done in CUDA rather than OpenCL. It uses floating point math, and there are better FFT libraries available for CUDA. (For the huge numbers involved, multiplication is more efficient via Fourier transform and convolution.)On the other hand, trial division (another important part of Mersenne prime search) seems to be more efficient with OpenCL on AMD, as it uses integer math. I assume Primecoin would work fine with just integer math.Sources: http://mersenneforum.org/forumdisplay.php?f=92Of course, there is a more ideological point about using a language that works across many platforms (CPUs and GPUs from several vendors) than tying yourself to Nvidia, especially in an open source project. Fixed that for you. FPGA FTW! As a way to make a quick buck? Maybe, maybe not.As an interesting experiment in math, science and economics? Hell yeah!My CPUs would be crunching primes anyway, so I'm not exactly losing anything by running primecoin instead.More generally, how do you measure the worth of something, whether it's useful? Maybe thing A is useful because it helps you with thing B. So what's B good for? Probably because it improves C, and so on - you'll never end up with some fundamental worth or utility this way. In the end, we all die, and we can't take our cryptocoins down into the crypt Personally, I play with cryptocurrencies because it's fun (and I dig math). IMHO, where worth begins, fun ends. I can warmly recommend bitcoin.de. Not an exchange like mtgox or bitstamp, the EUR goes directly from user to user, so it's much faster to cash out than most exchanges. Aha, so while the integer part is logarithmic, the fractional part is linear? I thought the fractional part was represented in a way that makes the entire number smoothly logarithmic (if you have something linear, just take the log, then the addition of these parts corresponds to multiplication in the "original" difficulty space).Of course, if there are these complications close to the next integer, it won't work exactly, but it might be a useful estimate for long-term block rewards anyway. It's not like mining calculators can guarantee when you find the next block  In fact, whether the fractional part is logarithmic or linear won't make such a huge difference, because a huge majority of the difficulty is in the integer part. (Putting my physicist hat on - we're interpolating between two points we know to be correct, so it's hard to make any huge deviations, especially when you are close to either point.)I admit the base must be much more like 12 than 30, when looking at past block rates. I wonder where the 30 came from, though, I recall seeing it in a number of posts... I should probalby have linked to the readme instead. These are some of my personal cryptocoin scripts I've been building up since 2010, and I'm not sure if they are useful to anyone else, but feel free to grab some ideas. So in other words, your average rate of blocks per hour would be the 5-chain rate / 30^(diff - 5). Time to write a script...Edit: updated the script. Gentoo ebuild of hp4:https://github.com/teknohog/ebuilds/tree/master/net-p2p/primecoind-hpBTW, in case you wonder about different ebuilds from different people, mine are not just straight from the source, but based on bitcoind from Portage. They include a patch to use system leveldb, instead of building its own copy each time. This is going way off topic, but as a somewhat oldskool Linux/unix geek it's interesting to see how cryptocurrencies make people learn about real computingTM GNU style options always have long and short forms, distinguished by the dashes. For example, you'd have both --daemon and -d for the same option. Not everything follows this, though, so --daemon might be completely different from -daemon. Seconded. I'm guessing it's because the primality test used here is not absolute, it only tests for probable primality. One way to do this is trial division by smaller primes.
I think the common vanitygen can do this with an address version of 23.Code:./vanitygen -X 23 -i alcohol There are definitely an infinite number of primes. Given a set of primes, you can easily show that there must be one more prime, and so on.This project is not about finding new primes, because new ones are too big to verify in any sensible time for a block interval.What does "scientifically useful" mean, anyway? Is something useful only because it makes money (ahem) or is the expansion of collective knowledge enough?BTW, if you use encryption such as https, you are using the results of prime number math. Primes are to mathematics what elements are to chemistry. 1421515428bf4b0867cf6b75a85375f6a2266e54a1c9f244befeee72ec0545300ae0fBlock 15794 Ah, yes - the good old days when men were men and wrote their own Primecoin clients in binary on punch cards. Kids these days with their newfangled compilers and all... pfft. Now get off my lawn! One Satoshi Nakamoto is easily worth ten mortals, so that's it for the top 10. Is this the guy who had closed GPU and FPGA miners before the public, opensource ones? Isn't Bitcoin all about open source? You use Gentoo and you need to ask? Perhaps start with these (the first two I googled)http://linuxreviews.org/gentoo/ebuilds/https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=3&chap=5Hence the ebuild (I do have a standalone build script for a few coins, but I've had issues with it recently, and the ebuild way was easier to fix.) Gentoo ebuild of the daemon here, for the true believers. Modified from bitcoind 0.8.2 ebuild.https://github.com/teknohog/ebuilds/tree/master/net-p2p/primecoind There are infinitely many primes. However, the table of known primes is rather big and increasing all the time. New primes are huge and it takes weeks/months of computing power to find them, so I don't think this project can actually find any new ones.So in a way, I believe you could use the list of known primes, but then it becomes a memory-bound problem, and it's probably faster to use other tests than search through the list. Yes, that should be fine. In fact, many commercial FPGA miners (such as BFL) use UART in the same way, with integrated USB-serial adapters such as the EZ-USB.UART is used in the FPGA scene, because it is much simpler than full USB. However, most modern computers do not have real serial ports, so we end up using those adapters. Nice! While this hasn't solved my problems with some quirky serial ports, I can see it is generally useful, and I'd like to merge it back to my repo. Problem is, I'm not well versed in git... so perhaps you could make a pull request?Edit: Thanks, merged  teknohogAddress in sig. Thanks in advance and greetz to everyone using my FPGA code   Wow, your approach is seriously interesting. I wonder how much of the current ASIC mining designs are simply hardcoded implementations of the old FPGA stuff -- obviously, there must be some ASIC specific design, but to the outside the entire mining industry seems like an endless scaling up of old ideas.Designing for a specific FPGA and using its timing quirks to your advantage goes against all the basics I hear -- that FPGAs are meant for quick prototyping. This is a good sign of the old hacker spirit.I've also wondered how much FPGA circuit designs are limited by programmers who are used to sequential designs. For example, could you design a clockless network that spits out the result of SHA256. I dabble in analog electronics, where you can do fairly complicated things without any clocking, so I like to imagine how far you could extend these ideas in the digital realm. Then again, I understand it's the analog properties of a circuit that introduce delay, and one way to deal with that delay is clocking.Anyway, good luck with the project  I do hope you would opensource it at some point, so we can all learn something after you've earned enough coin. It does look a little funny, because these are not particularly good mining hardware. They are basically massively parallel sets of x86 CPUs, so the potential mining efficiency would be somewhere between a CPU and a GPU. On the other hand, a lot of people might find these useful, and if you can buy them with BTC, then great!Unless, of course, it's really a scam, but who knows... I've ported some of my projects to work with cgminer, and they work with some limitations. The same idea did not work with my little Nexys2 -- it's probably too slow. If you have a somewhat faster FPGA, you could try one of thesehttps://github.com/teknohog/Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner/tree/master/projects/DE2_115_makomk_serial_109mhz_cgminerhttps://github.com/teknohog/Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner/tree/master/projects/DE2_115_cluster_cgminerhttps://github.com/teknohog/Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner/tree/master/projects/Xilinx_cluster_cgminerIn the cluster projects, simply build with one local miner and total miners = 1 to get a standalone version. While you're referring to all these open source projects, care to share some of your scrypt mining code? I'm not very active in this scene at the moment, but it would be interesting to try this on different FPGAs... It's the Dr. Evil version of Bitcoin, just like the ''La-Ser''. Satoshi probably prefers some kind of unix (more likely Net/OpenBSD than Linux), but chose the 'wrong' OS and a different coding style to mislead everyone. fpgaminer.If you run an FPGA or ASIC miner, chances are you are using his design one way or another. I like to think hardware design is somehow more fundamental than writing software, even if it's not always true 
First of all, I've changed my DE2-115 cgminer project to use the uart_* code from the KC705 project. It's nice to use something GPL3, and it was almost a drop-in replacement While we're discussing comms, it would be great to agree on a semi-standard serial protocol for all these opensource projects. If there are enough users, a driver for cgminer could be written. The current solution with the Icarus driver is not very reliable.My original project simply sent the golden nonce, it was enough for simple getwork, but not good in the long run. Icarus changed this to send zero for out-of-work, but it's not very good because zero is a valid nonce (though you can distinguish them from the timing). Also, it's nice to have some diagnostics (temperature). It's also easier if the return value is always of the same length. For example, 2 bytes for the type of return data and 4 bytes data (nonce, temperature etc.) would be a huge improvement. It's all there in serial.v and fpgaminer_top.v. Read the spec too for an overview.Edit: now using UART code from KC705_experimental. I've got the DE2-115 miner working with cgminer:https://github.com/teknohog/Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner/tree/master/projects/DE2_115_makomk_serial_109mhz_cgminerI can do this for any project that uses my serial mining code. The reason is, as I only recently learned, that Icarus was based on my serial mining cluster project. There was only a small change in my protocol to facilitate Stratum etc:http://en.qi-hardware.com/wiki/Icarus#Communication_protocol_V3so I updated my code accordingly (from the spec, not Icarus code). Now the device can use the Icarus driver in cgminer, at least when timings etc. are set accordingly.For some reason, I can only get this to work with cgminer version 3.1.1. Perhaps it's due to a quirky USB-serial converter -- I'll test with other hardware later. Nice to see my serial clustering code (as originally developed on a Nexys2) is still alive and well  FPGA design  At the end of last year, I quit work and went back to university to study a little more math. I like having something simple and official to answer when people ask me what I do. It's weird how people expect to define yourself on the basis of what kind of slavery you choose in order to fulfill your physical needs, while the true self is probably engaged in a multitude of completely different interests.It's funny, at the time I didn't expect such events with Bitcoin and the Euro. I was tired of my work, and I thought I'd enjoy a year or two of student life on my savings, while actually building on my professional qualifications. Now it might be a few more years... http://xkcd.com/566/ Code:$ lspci | grep -i vga01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Cypress XT [Radeon HD 5870]06:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Cypress XT [Radeon HD 5870]Nothing wrong with Cypress when it comes to healthy monetary systems. Cyprus, on the other hand... That will be fine as long as one Satoshi is smaller than one dollar... ...a gold bar. I can hash cheezburger? This. I also think "mining" is a stupid term that should never have been used. I like to tell people that somebody has to keep this wonderful network running, and it takes a little work, hardware and electricity; as a compensation, there are the block rewards. It's no more "free money" than any other work. Sure, it is heavily automatized, but the pay is not that great, so it's essentially a hobby for most participants. Wow, cheers!  PB2FSoBojFp76CCRDkivpdEASAxv9AyvuL I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I nominate 1Guy1JarSpEhxb94VYMYRvTMhqbAgdnCtL. Seconded. There is a (related?) problem with search, for example no hits for "thinkpad" or "lenovo" even though such machines are clearly available after some tedious browsing around.Edit: search seems to work now, thanks! What's a girl?Seriously though, invest in good quality coolers like Shaman for GPUs, and you won't hear a thing. Of course, once you're filthy rich from all that mining, you'll have a hard time keeping all the girls out, so it may be a good idea to get the noise levels back up.Back on topic: you know you're a true Bitcoiner when you learn Verilog just so you could develop FPGA miners. Seriously, no one recognizes this as the Greek Beta? I though it should be widely known, at least in science/geek circles. Besides, Beta and Eszett should look different when you have a decent font.Personally, I prefer BTC to any symbol, if only because it is already available in plain ASCII. To me that looks like the Greek letter Beta, which is just a "b" in pronunciation.It might also be the German Eszett, but good fonts usually make the difference clear. It is a combination of a long s (like the integral sign) and short s (our usual s), and knowing this makes it easy to spot the difference. Of course, many basic fonts use beta for both, and we can only tell from context which one is intended. I think it would be fair that neither side blames the other, until we know what happened. I don't like the way the admin blames people's password policies, while we know that even those with good passwords were attacked.BTW, if I am being keylogged, why do I have any money left on my local machines?
Just to clarify one thing: there was no email confirmation for the change of withdrawal address, because I had left it empty. This is apparently a feature -- people are expected to enter one initially, when they register. (Some exchanges force you to enter one upon registration, it might be a good policy to adopt here as well.) Anyway, if your withdrawal address is empty, do enter one now. No, it's been several hours since my email now. I would also expect some general notice, given that there have been multiple victims on the same day. Yes, well, I only had 1 BTC there. The thief even left the withdrawal address:1GRBm7iQMGsgWjHPSTcGBMTzQwhTWyPZMhIt looks a bit odd, because the attack was done somehow "from the inside" (because of the email confirmation that would have happened normally), but they did not manage to cancel a pending transaction. Leaving the withdrawal address is also a little amateurish, though it does not really help me.On the plus side, this is why I only keep a minimum of BTC available on such exchanges at a time.  I lost 1 BTC today from Bitmarket.eu. Somebody had changed the withdrawal address. There should be an email confirmation for the change of address, so it was something deeper than simply getting my password.So far I have good experience from Bitmarket, they have always replied to my issues. But this does not look good. I'lll drink to that, for Satoshi's sake    Export the private keys of each wallet and import them all into the new one.This is probably what the Pywallet reply is about, but there are other ways. Bitcoind itself has the "dumpprivkey" and "importprivkey" commands. I use my Python script to do this.Exporting and importing keys has some definite advantages compared to sending coins the usual way:No transaction feesKeep receiving addresses alive Received: 9/25/2012(Shipped 9/17 -- exactly after six weeks, arrived in Finland on 9/21, but the customs processing took a few more days... UPS and DHL would much faster in this regard.) However, they should show up in the raw list of transactions, available via "ppcoind listtransactions". Also note that the current block reward is much higher than 50 (I just realized my script shows them as regular transactions; I did not care to check the "immature" bit, since I've done most of my *coin mining via pools. I admit it's fun to solo mine for blocks again ) Seconded. Whenever I look at the graphs by Sipa, I cannot help imagining there must be some daily/weekly trends. For example, workplace computers being turned on and off daily. However, that would only be noticeable if the computers are unevenly distributed by timezone, although weekends would show a clear difference. Another weekly factor is that exchanges are quieter on weekends, when there are no bank transfers.I wonder what it would look like if the hashrate curves for each week were normalized, so as to compare them to each other to spot any trends. This would also filter out most of the inherent variance in hashing results. Apologies to those who fnord recognize the original. Well, my other 5870 uses slower memory, and worksize 256 actually makes it faster  Which is odd, because in the past I have experimented with different worksizes, but I did not use cgminer then. (The first 5870 does not allow memory downclocking for some reason.)Anyway, thanks for the quick reply, I'll see if I have any loose change to send you  I'll drink to that! I wondered why recent git versions have been slower on my 5870, about 414 vs. 421 Mhash/s. Using worksize 128 brought it back to the old speed. (Using fglrx 11.12 and SDK 2.5) I'll start my own fork of Bitcoin, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget about the Bitcoin. Ordered: 8/6/2012Quantity: 1 I used to compile and run the command-line bitcoind on several ARM systems. The slowest of these had 400 MHz CPUs and 128 MB of memory (one of them a Nokia N800). I cannot see any reason why the Pi could not run the full graphical version, as it should not add much CPU/disk load compared to the daemon. Ah, that's a good point. I guess I was being overly pessimistic about code developments Also, I can't help wondering what that speed means to mining. Using pools would be interesting, as you would getwork twice a second, and long polling would not help. Then again, solo mining would make sense again, at least for a short time, and pools could adjust to higher difficulties. Actually, my original intent for this code was to use multiple FPGAs as a single faster miner, using serial links. The same idea works also within a single chip, without the serial overhead, so it is suitable for this project.One key idea there is that miners work on different nonce ranges. Therefore, you cannot just add more miners in the same setup, you need to (re)configure them all to cover the whole range evenly. It is possible to make this configuration more dynamic, but it would be needlessly complicated for this project at this stage, IMHO.This also means that you cannot switch off miners as a power-saving measure. Since dynamic clocking was also mentioned for this purpose, it should be enough. Thanks!  I have run essentially the same code on both Altera and Xilinx boards, so there should not be too many issues. The main difference between those two has been clock management, which may have to be changed for different chip families from the same manufacturer. Nevertheless, it is only a few lines of boilerplate code.Also, my code does not include Makomk's optimization, since I use it for a cluster of low-end FPGAs where the optimization would not work. But changing that part should not be an issue either.Things like the number of miners per chip are mostly set by parameters. I hope my code and "documentation" are reasonably clear on their usage, especially since it's over half a year since I last worked on this   Cheers!  I agree we could well use something other than RS232. In fact, the essential parts of my multiple-miner setup use raw 32-bit nonces, and RS232 is only used for communications outside the FPGA.However, one reason I have stuck with RS232 is the ubiquity across platforms -- you can program the chip and mine using completely Free software. If I understand correctly, the FTDI solution would essentially be an onboard USB-serial converter, so no difference there. Unfortunately, I am using a third-party RS232 library, so that would probably have to change.There is also the issue that my code does not have long polling. It should not be too much work, since I already have the code for resetting the nonce range, and the rest is done by the computer. Then again, we are talking about maintaining the distributed nature of Bitcoin, and solo miners would not need LP.
https://github.com/teknohog/Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner/tree/master/projects/DE2_115_cluster Seems like regular OpenCL is on its way to the opensource Radeon drivers:http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTAyNTg IMHO, the short answer is that Bitcoin is a distributed network. If you want lots of people around the world to work on the same problem, you need to parallelize it one way or another.This question has already been asked in many ways. If you can limit mining to a single network node (CPU), dedicated miners will just set up multiple nodes for themselves. If you want to limit mining power per person, you've just thrown away the whole idea of an anonymous distributed network. Also, do you want to ban people from working together towards a common goal?Moreover, limiting generation per person throws away all incentives for developing the network. In its current form, the network is stronger against attacks, because people are rewarded for spending computational power on it. In other words, who is going to do any work, if you just give everyone a big chunk of money? Agreed!Not agreeing with this one, but perhaps it's just because I mine with FPGAs First of all, FPGAs are more power efficient than GPUs. GPUs get about 2 Mhash/J, but good FPGAs get about 20. Getting the same work done with less wasted energy (and environment) should be the goal of any sane person. Of course, the initial cost of FPGAs is a problem, and GPUs are better in the short run.Secondly, if the algorithm really only works on a CPU, then I'll download a CPU design on the FPGA and keep on mining  Though the point of reconfigurable hardware is that you'll almost always find a more efficient implementation than copying the original hardware.As for ASICs, I think we should be open to changing the algorithm anyway, so fixed-function chips would not make sense in the long run. For example, if SHA2 is broken. I believe it means they are built for hashing huge sets of data. Latency is not a problem since you have to wait for entire incoming data anyway. However, Bitcoin miners hash lots of small packets, and the I/O latency becomes important. In FPGA miners, this is solved by generating new datasets inside the chip (by incrementing the nonce), and only getting external data in (from bitcoin getwork) every few seconds. If you really want to learn about FPGAs, and not just mine Bitcoins, you will be much happier with a traditional dev kit. There are so many other fun things do with an FPGA, and for those you will need some I/O connectors, and a few onboard buttons/switches/LEDs will come in handy. Even some cheap kits will run a miner, for example the one mentioned here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=9047.msg451101#msg451101 I've been discussing with jonand about building a cluster of cheap FPGAs, and I've got the basic idea working:https://github.com/teknohog/Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner/tree/master/projects/DE2_115_clusterIt is a "cluster" of two miners on a single FPGA, but the links are asynchronous serial ports, so it could just as well be distributed. There is a hub that distributes work to miners and consolidates results, so a single serial port could drive a big number of FPGAs.This will take some work to make everything smooth, but I think the basic idea is valid. For example, there is an if-else construct that should be rewritten (with generate?) for any number of miners.Edit: the code is verified to work with an unholy alliance of one Xilinx and one Altera chip. To me "stealth" sounds like something invisible to radar... like not noticing the increased heat/sound output. Not to mention increased power consumption in the long run. Thanks, this is nice to know  I am concerned about communicating with the miner, because the original open source FPGA miner uses Altera's closed x86 software to talk over USB. Of course, there are ways to communicate via USB with open source software, but even then there can be driver issues. Serial port is safer in this sense, which is why I'm not the only one to choose it for FPGA mining.Of course, the FPGA can be programmed with a different computer from the one that is using the miner. However, things are often much more convenient if it is the same machine.Since I'm already starting to sound trollish, I may as well generalize that it's a bad idea to rely on closed software. For example, a friend of mine is worried about having an FPGA board that is only programmable from 32-bit Windows, as the support for XP is nearing its end. It's entirely possible to program and mine with Altera and Xilinx boards using open source on ARM, if you do your homework.Synthesizing the FPGA code still needs closed software, but at least it is free as in beer for some chips. This LX150 needs an expensive license that must be renewed annually. I guess this board is worth its price if you only consider it as bitcoin-only hardware, and don't plan on developing anything else. Good luck running the requisite Xilinx software on ARM. Even if you can program the FPGA (using something open like UrJTAG), further communication for actual mining might turn out difficult. This is one reason why I implemented serial port communications in my version of the FPGA miner. Why would you want to do this?I wouldn't want the small, whiny fan of this design anywhere near my apartment, but there are lots of better cooling solutions, and you can often go passive with a little thought. These typical designs where a fan is trying to push air through the chip, are clearly results of absolutely no thought to fluid dynamics. They are sometimes better off without the fan, especially if there is some airflow in the case already.There are over 100-watt GPUs with fanless air cooling. I have one of these (a HD5770), also most of my CPUs have fanless heatsinks. My FPGA board is also doing fine with a passive heatsink. I think bitcoind is "official", and it is a fully working client, I have never used the GUI version.256 MB (as in the N900) is enough for bitcoind, but not very good for extended use IMHO. I have one running on a 256 MB ARM server, and it uses about 400 MB of virtual memory. I used to have a 128 MB ARM server as well, and while it could run bitcoind, it used to swap a lot. I also have a feeling that bitcoind was somewhat leaner at the time (about a year ago).Command line use on a smaller device is harder, but the main problem is entering the address, which you need in a GUI as well. Of course, you can use copy/paste in both kinds of client. Another oldschool geek here  I think others have already listed the sensible reasons for staying out of FB, such as privacy concerns. I also feel there are vague, emotional reasons, such as maintaining a divide between us and the non-geeks. For example, people used to sneer at geeks who were doing fun stuff online, say 10-20 years ago, but now the same people are doing the same things on FB.There is also the general annoyance of FB as the overly hyped phenomenon that everyone should join just because everyone else does. It's like seeing McDonalds ads everywhere, which doesn't exactly increase my chances of ever wanting to eat there. Looking forward to this -- I'm a heterosexual guy and a geek who cares about his looks. (My FPGA miner has a matching blue heatsink.) There is an issue that worries some of us at the modular miner thread, and I think it is highly relevant here. Many of the better FPGAs require paid-for software licenses in order to develop any code. For example, the modular miner thread has agreed on a chip that needs $2000 a year for such a license.It is debatable whether this makes the project any less "open source"; after all, even the $0 software for FPGA development is closed source. However, my question is, do we include such a license fee in the Mhash/$ criterion?It may be possible that other people can use the generated design without the software, so we should only factor in the hardware cost. However, in that case I would not consider the whole package "open source", because I would not be able to play with the code at that price.I generally refuse to buy any hardware that I cannot program freely, and I think this is particularly important when buying something for a singular purpose. Even if Bitcoin fails in the near future, I can continue to use my GPUs and FPGAs in other fun ways. Me too, it would be great to use them in online stores, but there's hardly anything interesting available. I've tested the waters by getting a LED bulb from bitcoingadgets, it was a nice experience, but so far the only item I needed/wanted that could be paid in BTC. Don't forget that 10 minutes is the targeted average between blocks. Because the process is essentially random, you sometimes find less than 1 min between them, and sometimes closer to an hour. With a 10-minute average, the chances of getting two blocks too close together is low, but not impossible.In addition, hashing power keeps increasing (albeit slowly these days), so even the average is less than 10 minutes. Ah, I noticed this has already been discussed in some form. I think somebody also mentioned level converters, you could then use any general I/O pins for the serial port. For example, I've used an old Nokia phone cable for this, and then there are other simple circuits, for example using the MAX232.(A lot of embedded systems have serial ports at this 3.3V level. I guess you could have a serial connection with such levels at both ends, without any conversion.) Now there is:https://github.com/teknohog/Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner/tree/master/projects/DE2_115_makomk_serialBasically, my earlier serial port code for Xilinx, adapted into the DE2-115 project. As with the other projects, this runs at 50 MHz by default, but I chose the makomk version so that I could run it at 109 MHz, and it works great I also found a way to program the FPGA without Altera tools, using UrJTAG. There is a script included for this.I'll also post .sof and .svf files for a quick start, as soon as the 50 MHz versions are ready.By the way, one reason for this port was the problem of getting tclcurl working. The Quartus II software for Linux is 32-bit only, and while it runs on a 64-bit system, it is tricky to install a suitable library.
To do arithmetic in Bash (that's the language ) you need something likeCode:ping_pause=$((5*60)) In that case, you need a switch so you get many connections out of that one. Then find a long enough cable.You should never rely on wireless connections for things that need to be "always on". There are many more things to go wrong, compared to wired, though I believe that script helps to some extent. I have tried to go wireless with a miner (and similar things before Bitcoin), but in the end you need to go wired for anything serious. WLAN is designed for intermittent usage, like checking your mail in a cafe, not serious server-type uses.As for the noise issue, there are ways to make a completely silent rig, in this case about 818 Mhash/s. Heat is still a problem during the summer, though. Micro means one millionth, you need to use something else to avoid a huge confusion. What is wrong with milli anyway? For example, the Tunisian dinar is divided into 1000 millimes. I'm no expert on the hardware design, but there is at least one issue against the LX150: It requires commercial software to synthesize the design. The free web edition only supports Spartan 6 up to LX45, if I recall correctly.Xilinx seems to package the requisite software with their dev kits, so it is likely that someone here has it and could distribute the generated bitfile. But it is a problem for this open source mentality if I cannot tinker with the device I own.Another question, is there already an open source implementation that works on the LX150? We know there is one for the Cyclone IV, along with a nicer license policy of the synthesis software. Just try it. It's worked for me well enough. I've been using one without a Molex for several months. The card is a HD5870. Of course, most of the power is coming from PCIe power connectors. I think mineral oil would be overkill for 4.4 watts. For starters, you would need fancy sealing to get the wires through. I'm sure there are simpler ways of mating the chip with the heatsink.(This is probably off-topic, but I've given a lot of though to quiet cooling. For starters, you can buy a passive-cooled HD5770, that's over 100 W without mineral oil. A case fan is needed, but a 12-cm one at 7 V will do without making any discernible sound. Similar fans are found in some aftermarket coolers for HD5870s. Then there are passive-cooled power supplies, at least up to 460 W which powers two 5870s nicely. Plus, obviously, fanless CPUs.)That said, I agree that GPUs are wasteful, and I appreciate your work with FPGAs. But to me the problem is simply power consumption, because the noise problem has already been solved. Better stay at home if you're suffering from chicken gox. I ported the original FPGA miner to a Spartan 3E with 500K gates, so if you mean 1000K gates, it is certainly possible. The original was tied to Altera chips, here is my version for Xilinx with serial port communications:https://github.com/teknohog/Xilinx-Serial-MinerI had to keep the parameter LOOP_LOG2 at 5 for minimum unrolling, and I get 3 Mhash/s at 100 MHz. With bigger chips you should be able to decrease this for more unrolling and better hashrates.However, a general issue with Xilinx seems to be that these designs need a lot of routing, so you run out of wires when trying to use all of the gates. Altera seems better in this respect.Some of the others seem to be working on these issues with different designs. I have not yet touched the actual hashing code, I merely did the minimum to get this running on a Spartan. I got exactly the same error with Apache, and I even did some debugging via tcpdump. It seemed like the proxy was not even asking for any work from the pools. The solution turned out simple, I had to setallow_url_fopen = Onin php.ini.So, lighttpd (which uses PHP via fastcgi) seems to work. As I just got it working, I have no long-term data which might be important for long polling, but so far things are OK  A frustrated miner walks past a bar. I think I know the feeling. I have been fairly lucky with solo mining, for example, one of my GPUs once found 4 blocks in 5 days, when the expected time between blocks for that card was over 20 days. However, with the recent surge in difficulty, I have switched to pools. At the moment my favourite one is Swepool, with zero fees and a 0.5 BTC block finding bonus.In the past I have spoken against pooled mining, because they generate extra network congestion, and they introduce centralized weaknesses in the originally pure P2P network. However, there are the obvious positive sides too.Even for a strong miner with many Ghash/s, they give a kind of insurance: say you expect to find a block in 5 days, but your system crashes after 4 days. In this case, the work of 4 days is not wasted if you are in a pool. Has anyone got this working with Lighttpd (under Gentoo)? I am trying to rule out wider system-level errors before digging deeper into this code. Basically, my clients (Phoenix) are connecting to the proxy, but they are not getting any work. My PHP setup should be OK as I use it for other web content, and the admin interface seems to work fine. I have set this up in a separate port so there are no subdirectory issues for clients. GLSL is a standard part of OpenGL that people have used for non-graphics calculations. However, it is not particularly good, see this post for example:http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=4618.msg191488#msg191488 I made two SEPA withdrawals from MtGox in May, and both arrived on the following day. This was surprisingly good to me, since here in Finland it often takes 2 days to transfer between different local banks.The day before yesterday I made another one, and I just checked my account, it has not arrived yet. Given it is a busy time at MtGox, and something like 3 to 4 days is expected from SEPA payments, I am not too worried. I have previously contacted them when my LR transfer did not show up, and they fixed the situation in no time. I've thought about this too -- not just because of the price, but simply having all those nice components I could not use while the thing is mining. There are some more minimal boards available, such as this one with an LX150, for about 400 euros with the necessary baseboard:http://shop.trenz-electronic.de/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=1_65_143&products_id=917&osCsid=40823974778ae324bbd6778f2e17b289Another problem is that the free-beer Xilinx software does not work with the largest chips, beyond LX45 or something. It seems a lot of posters are misunderstanding the question. While 1x slots with extenders are fine for mining, you cannot make a number of 1x slots from one 16x slot. No, I haven't tried it as I only have a Spartan 3E 500K. I have only been looking at the specs of Spartan 6 and others, so as to find the biggest number of logic units. Thanks for the idea though, testing the synthesis in advance would help us choose the best chip.On another note, I have been estimating how my miner performs, based on how often a solution is found. I'm getting something like 3 to 4 Mhash/s at 100 MHz, which is much better than expected, but I may just be lucky. The mining script is updated to show these estimates, though with some more work you could get actual rates from the chip. I haven't figured it out exactly, but I understand that without any unrolling, it takes something like 66 clock cycles per hash, so at 50 MHz this is a little less that 1 Mhash/s. This would give about 1.5 h between shares in a pool, which is roughly what I see.However, this is only about 60 % utilization, it's frustratingly close to being able to double this. (It would need about 10K vs. my 9K LUTs.) The next best Spartan3 has 1200K gates vs this 500K, so it might be able to quadruple the units.I think you need a Spartan6 to do any serious mining, but even then you should check the number of logic units, the series has some low-end models as well.Of course, you can also increase the clock frequency. But, for example, the current code on this chip is limited to about 70 MHz. Phew! After a couple of weeks of learning FPGAs, here is my port of the "Official" FPGA miner to Xilinx chips, using the serial port for communications:http://iki.fi/teknohog/hacks/software/xilinx-serial-miner.zipI have tried to make only minimal changes to the original Verilog code. The communication could probably use some error checking, but it's a "works for me" first release, with a few accepted shares in a pool.Unfortunately, my Spartan3E 500K has to keep the loop unrolling to a minimum. 
I could probably do this if I had a suitable FPGA to try your code...I've been playing around with a Spartan 3E board for a couple of weeks, and I use RS232 for similar reasons as you. I've found pyserial a nice and simple way to communicate with the board, as I already know Python quite well.I planned to implement a toy miner using the Opencores sha256 module, and use jgarzik's pyminer on the computer end. Unfortunately, I keep having trouble with some details. The output side of that module seems rather erratic (confirmed by other people's bug reports), and I'm still learning the very basics of Verilog. Also, it seems that open source miners for low-end FPGAs will soon be available anyway. These cards will be powered by separate PCIe power connectors anyway, so it does not make a difference. PCIe itself provides 75 W of power.I have a HD5570 running with one of these 1x extenders, it consumes about 40 W via the PCIe and has been doing fine for a couple of months. Me too. Power efficiency is much more important in the long run. Satoshi has horizontal.¥AFAIK, those extra lines in currency letters are there to denote stability, and IMHO horizontal lines convey this idea better. However, vertical seems to go better with letters like B and S, and the Baht symbol is quite established for Bitcoin already. There must be cheaper and simpler boards with the same or equivalent FPGA. If you buy this board just for mining, all those nice I/O ports and displays are going to waste. A Spartan 3E 250K has 5508 logic cells. If I understand correctly, this is not enough for a design that needs 90K LUTs, though I'm still learning about all of this. There are SHA-256 ASICs around, but they are basically I/O limited. They are fine for getting a hash of some given string, but in a Bitcoin miner you are incrementing a part of the input in a specific way. This can be done inside the chip, so you don't need a particularly high I/O with the outside world. Thanks, this looks nice I was thinking of doing something similar the other day, but I noticed that AMDOverdriveCtrl can also run on the command line (with a proper DISPLAY= variable in the environment).The only problem was that in this mode, it can only load one default setting, so it takes some scripting to set multiple cards. In my case, the card indices are 0 and 3, so my config files are default-0.ovdr and default-3.ovdr. Each is symlinked to default.ovdr in turn, for running the overdrive command.Code:CMD=AMDOverdriveCtrlDIR=~/.AMDOverdriveCtrlLINK=default.ovdrcd $DIRexport DISPLAY=:0INDICES="`ls default-*.ovdr | sed -e 's/default-\([0-9]\+\).ovdr/\1/'`"for i in $INDICES; do    rm $LINK    ln -s default-$i.ovdr $LINK    $CMD -i $i -a -bdone 10 BTC here. I'm a Gentoo geek and I emerge every day  It does involve a lot of hash, so it must be illegal... Tit for TAT. Gentoo users may notice that twisted-web2 is not in Portage. You can find it in the sage-on-gentoo overlay. Here's another 10 BTC. With the recent USD price of bitcoins, I wouldn't even say "it's not much". I can hash cheezburger?(A legitimate question on getting free money, if only a little redundant) I used a blade lodged into a groove in my soldering iron. I spent quite a while finishing it off, as I preferred to remove too little at a time, rather than too much. Yes, and not just me.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4648.0 Which SDK version are you using? Many people (including me) have had this scaling problem with newer SDKs, and 2.1 is the only one that works well. Zotac NM10-DTX.It has a 16x and a 1x slot, though both are only 1x electrically. An extender is necessary since they are next to each other, and one GPU takes at least 2 slots. I use a 1x extender with the end cut open to allow a full-size card.If I were buying a similar motherboard now, I would choose something like Asus E35M1-M (with AMD Zacate), as it has a much better set of connectors and slots. I've been feeding two cards with an Atom D510, both cards on 1x slots. There is no noticeable difference to a faster system with 16x slots. The CPU load is pretty much zero in any case, and many people have found that that PCIe slot width is irrelevant. I even have one card mining in a conventional PCI slot through an an adapter, so it is even slower than 1x PCIe, but again there is no noticeable slowdown.
Seems awfully low, do you mean a 5570? My 5570 (at 800 MHz) gets about 73 Mhash/s, whereas my 5770 (at 900 MHz) gets 180 Mhash/s.At the current difficulty, this 5570 takes an average of 63 days between finding blocks. So for your own mental health, it is probably better to join a pool and get a steady trickle of coins. Thanks, this is exactly the kind of site I was looking for. Suppose I have a couple of hundred Euros to spend, and I want to learn about FPGAs in general (Bitcoin is just a nice excuse). Where should I begin? I have a range of experience in electronics and programming, and I use Linux, which may limit the choice of hardware/software somewhat. Satoshi is Number One. Or perhaps Two, or Six.Be seeing you. This part sounds like the problem many users have had with multiple GPUs. The solution is to use SDK version 2.1 instead of newer ones. There may be other problems in your case, but try this one first. For 4 cards you would need 3 spaces in between, so a total of 7 slots would suffice. Of course, for cooling you need extenders. 1x extenders are probably better for airflow and extra flexibility, and the 1x speed is not a concern for mining. These are based on the fact that PCI is a shared bus, so you can basically add things in parallel without much electronics. In total it is slower than a 1x PCIe channel, so there will be limits to scaling this way.There are also PCI Express splitters/hubs, which need a little more electronics, but the total capacity is likewise divided. For example herehttp://www.magma.com/expressbox7x8RASG2.asp/ Since mining works fine in a 1x PCIe slot, why not go even slower with the conventional PCI bus? I bought one of these adapters for testing ($28 incl. shipping on Ebay) and it seems to work fine. HD5870 at 900 MHz gives 354 Mhash/s, which is no different from running it in a 16x PCIe slot. Now I can fit even more cards in this single mobo There are just a few practical considerations. PCI is a shared bus, so performance may go down with more than one of these adapters. Also, PCI only gives 25 W of power, vs. 75 W of PCIe, but this does not seem to be a problem when the card is powered externally. Mounting the card is yet another issue, since this is basically a riser card.Also, X refused to start in the usual way, but it worked after setting BusID explicitly. In my case, it wasBusID  "PCI:6:0:0"The exact number can be seen from lspci, in a slightly different format like 06:00.0 in this case. The line goes in the Device section of xorg.conf.(using Linux 2.6.37.5, fglrx 10.12, SDK 2.1) I used to have the same problem, and SDK 2.1 does indeed fix it  The driver version is 10.12 as it is the latest that works on Gentoo, with Linux kernel 2.6.37.4.I guess I was reluctant to try this SDK, since 2.2 worked much better with HD5570 (also using an older version of poclbm), but a few Mhash/s is not a bad price for getting the full setup to work. As a nice bonus, CPU load is way down. With SDK 2.2, each miner consumed 100% CPU, but now it is barely noticeable. Also happens to me in Linux, driver 10.12 and SDK 2.2. On all of my Radeons, 5570, 5770 and 5870.I noticed this started when poclbm switched to the ArtForz kernel. In fact, on 5570 an older version is faster, and on 5770 there is no noticeable difference, so I keep using the older version for them. There are also PCIe extenders with a ribbon cable. At least the x1 ones should be better for cooling, and they would also give more options for mounting the cards away from each other. I have a Zotac NM10 board with a full-length PCIe slot that is only x1 speed. It works fine for mining and there are no power problems, since higher-power cards (currently a HD5770) use separate power cables anyway. A HD5570 that draws about 40 W (no separate power) has also worked fine.I have tried to use another GPU with an extender, since the mobo has another x1 slot, but it is normally under the heatsink of the first GPU. This did not work as expected, I could never get the total hash rate above that of a single card. I think this is due to other limitations in the mobo/CPU, since individually the GPUs work fine in their x1 slots, even with the extender.An extender/riser may be a problem when the GPU is powered via the PCIe slot, but it should be OK for separately powered cards.The Zotac is also my main HTPC, and when watching videos I simply use a higher -f setting for smoother playback. This slows down hashing quite severely, and I think a x16 slot does a lot better in these situations. But for mining only, the slowdown of a x1 slot is really only marginal. I have done this to a x1 riser/extender, so the motherboard connector could stay intact. The plastic is hard enough to work with, even in a separate riser, and it would be easy to damage the motherboard. I used a small blade mounted on a soldering iron. The x1 slot is also fine for mining. I can tell from experience that the difference from x16 slots is only marginal. Perhaps there is a notable effect with faster cards, but at least a HD5770 at 174 Mhash/s is basically unaffected. This has already been discussed a number of times. The little-endian assumption is deep in the code and protocol. It is a pretty frustrating assumption for something that strives to became a global standard, but it is how things are right now. Moreover, the sha-256 algorithm is basically big-endian, and it would not need all those byte swaps on PPC. I wonder what banks etc. will do with their big-endian big iron if they want to participate in the economy. Chinese numerals are grouped in terms of 10^4, and the same system is used in Japan. I am not sure if this is the reason behind 10^-8 bitcoins, but at least it would appear simpler in those countries. 10^3 and 10^6 are only simpler for Westerners.Then again, SI prefixes are by definition the international standard. If only they were actually used, instead of the billions and trillions whose meanings change by the country/continent. In my understanding, it is because we expect a new block every 10 minutes. If you have to crunch for 5 minutes, there is a good chance that someone else produces a fresh block first, and your block will be stale.Nevertheless, it is appropriate to highlight these issues. I feel that huge mining pools are not good network-wise. In addition to the increased traffic, you have a single point of failure, in what used to be a distributed P2P effort.I think pools are great for slower GPUs and CPUs, because otherwise the user might not be interested in mining at all. Thus their contribution can make the network stronger. However, when miners with strong GPUs switch from local mining to a pool, the effect is quite the contrary. In my experience, 2.2 is the best. 2.1 used to have compilation problems with vectors, and 2.3 is a little slower (on a HD5770). These things really seem to be different for different setups, so there is no reason to follow an arbitrary rumour. Try them all and see what works best for you. If anyone is using multiple GPUs on Linux, can you please post some more details?I tried this the other day (5570 + 5770) and the results were not impressive. Ideally, I wanted to use the weaker card for my main screen, so the other GPU could crunch at a lower FPS. However, anything to increase the hash rate compared to the single 5770 would be nice.The setup was one X server with two screens, both connected to the same monitor since the Radeons cannot work headless. The problem was that while one GPU was crunching at a low FPS, the other screen was also lagging. In addition, crunching on the other GPU was severely slowed down. I could not get the total hash rate above that of the single 5770.Is anyone using separate X servers or some other kind of setup? I suspect my system might have some inherent limitations (weak CPU, only 1x PCIe slots), so if other people have working dual-screen setups, I probably won't bother with any other tricks. Same here. I started using Bitcoin in July 2010, and all that time I have used db 4.8, as it has been the latest stable version.
I think the logic at most exchanges is that bitcoins are a commodity, and you use a more established currency to buy commodities. It would be great to have "mobile" GPUs in standard PCIe cards. I would definitely pay extra to get that improved performance per watt. I have already been using Mini-ITX/DTX machines for years, with "mobile" CPUs and chipsets in "desktop" systems.One problem with using laptops for full-time number crunching is that the size necessitates small and noisy fans. Having those "mobile" components in an ATX case is pretty nice, since you can then have huge heatsinks and a large, slow fan. The only thing missing is a strong "mobile" GPU. Aside from the purposeful crippling, there are simply different design choices behind AMD and Nvidia GPUs. One focuses more on integer performance, the other on floating point. Both can be used for graphics, but in general purpose computation you obviously see some difference.Interestingly enough, the search for Mersenne primes is an integer venture, but it is more practically realized using double-precision floating point. Currently it is mostly done with CPUs, but the GPU efforts are mainly focused on Nvidia cards:http://mersenneforum.org/forumdisplay.php?f=92For me, one important reason for going with AMD cards is their support for open source. While the OS drivers for their latest cards are far from complete (at least for OpenCL), they do provide full documentation, which shows a positive attitude towards OS. As a result, you can get accelerated OpenGL with Linux on PowerPC, for which no binary drivers have been released, and you are no longer dependent on the company's whims for future driver releases.(The wiki could use a little updating, as I now get about 63 Mhash/s from the HD5570 after playing with the -w and -v options. I also have a HD5770 that hashes at 164M.) Thanks for the info. By the way, does Crossfire mean that the client sees a single GPU with doubled performance, or do  you need to use two clients?It seems I may have some thermal issues, as my card is passively cooled and needs extra care with the case airflow. When using slush's pool, a few % of my results were invalid, but the error rate goes down as I improve ventilation.The card does feature thermal throttling, which became evident as the case fan was accidentally disconnected, and the hash rate went down. Unfortunately, it is not sensitive enough. I assume the error tolerance in GPUs is higher than in CPUs, considering the majority of uses. In any case it is hard to say if the GPU is faulty, since it works fine most of the time.As for Sawzall's RPC problems, I wonder if this is relevant: I used to have a http_proxy variable in my shell, as some browsers (notably Chrome) could not be configured to use a proxy otherwise. Since json-rpc uses http, it was confused by the proxy, and it took me a while to see where the problem was.Update: I swapped the PSU, and have been running error-free for 20 hours since then, about 2700 shares in the pool. Also tested with AMD's tools (aticonfig, atiode) that the GPU is fine. So it was most likely a PSU problem. With SDK 2.1, the miner does not even compile with vectors Code:/tmp/OCLQa31hL.cl(128): error: mixed vector-scalar operation not allowed          unless up-convertable(scalar-type=>vector-element-type)        sharound(E,F,G,H,A,B,C,D,R(36),0x650A7354);But it gets stranger. After reinstalling 2.2, I am getting accepted results with vectors, using the latest version of poclbm. So this looks like an error in my system, and poclbm is fine (Possible sources of error: overheated GPU, which is now cooler after the SDK changes; pyopencl, which is the only component I have to manually compile and install with every SDK change.) I have experienced some further oddities with the vectors option, since upgrading to a HD5770. The option seems to work, as in increasing the hash rate (as opposed to the slowdown on HD5570). However, the blocks found are invariably "invalid or stale". Without vectors the blocks are fine, at least on testnet.As with the HD5570, going back to commit 99c57637ca0d1db70187 helps. The vectors option increases the rate, and blocks are OK. Unfortunately, this is somewhat slower than using the new version with vectors (about 156 vs. 164 Mhash/s) but I think I will choose the way that actually generates blocks  The new version without vectors gives about 153 Mhash/s.The system is a Gentoo Linux, kernel 2.6.36.2, with catalyst 10.11 drivers and SDK 2.2. The PCIe slots are only 1x wide, but this probably only affects performance. So double spending is possible in general? I can just make 10 copies of my wallet, and buy something worth 10 times my balance? To be precise, the drift speed of electrons in wires is very slow. It is the speed of electromagnetic waves in the insulating medium that matters, and that is about 2/3 of the speed of light.A common analogy is a garden hose full of water. When you add a little water at one end, some water comes out at the other end almost immediately. The individual water molecules need not traverse the entire distance. (A particularly nice analogy, because the speed of the effect is likewise determined by electromagnetic waves.) Some stats that I gathered via the json interface:Code:Blocks:                 20Difficulty:             12252.03471156Mean shares per block:  15978.65Std. deviation:         11854.889675889019Std. deviation of mean: 2650.8339181048295p:                      0.1597754530320632These blocks were created with the old difficulty, so it is not yet updated here.I was mainly interested in the relation between difficulty and mean shares/block, since ideally they should be equal. Of course, due to the small number of blocks, there will be differences. For the statistical significance of this difference, there is the probability p. Very small values such as 0.01 would indicate that something funny is going on, perhaps cheating.Below is the code I used. The calculation of p is not very accurate, as I assumed a normal distribution. More realistically it should be the Poisson interval distribution, but I am not sure how to apply a z-test in that case. Nevertheless, this might be of interest to someone.Code:#!/usr/bin/env pythonurl = "http://mining.bitcoin.cz/stats/json/"#from jsonrpc import ServiceProxy#s = ServiceProxy("http://user:passwd@yourip:8332/")#info = s.getinfo()#diff = ["difficulty"]diff = 12252.03471156import urllib, jsondef mean(l):    return sum(l) / len(l)def sigma(l):    m = mean(l)    return mean(map(lambda x: (x - m)**2, l))**0.5import math# from http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/IronPython_normal_prob.aspxdef phi(x):    # constants    a1 =  0.254829592    a2 = -0.284496736    a3 =  1.421413741    a4 = -1.453152027    a5 =  1.061405429    p  =  0.3275911    # Save the sign of x    sign = 1    if x < 0:        sign = -1    x = abs(x)/math.sqrt(2.0)    # A&S formula 7.1.26    t = 1.0/(1.0 + p*x)    y = 1.0 - (((((a5*t + a4)*t) + a3)*t + a2)*t + a1)*t*math.exp(-x*x)    return 0.5*(1.0 + sign*y)data = urllib.urlopen(url).read()blocks = json.loads(data)['blocks']# floats are better for mean/sigmashares = map(lambda x: float(blocks[x]['total_shares']), blocks.keys())n = len(shares)stddev = sigma(shares)sm = stddev / n**0.5m = mean(shares)# 2-sided z-test (normal distribution)z = (diff - m) / smp = 2*(1 - phi(abs(z)))output = [["Blocks", n],          ["Difficulty", diff],          ["Mean shares per block", m],          ["Std. deviation", stddev],          ["Std. deviation of mean", sm],          ["p", p],          ]width = max(map(lambda x: len(x[0]), output)) + 1for i in output:    print(i[0] + ":" + " "*(width - len(i[0])) + `i[1]`) OK, I stand corrected  I propose an idea for cheating in a mining pool. Please comment on the viability and suggest countermeasures if needed.The current pool by slush uses standard getwork miners with an artificially low difficulty. Such succesful hashes are used to gauge the level of contribution from a given miner. Now suppose that whenever a miner finds a block that satisfies the actual Bitcoin difficulty, they return it to their own local bitcoind instead of the pool. The pool continues to get measures of contribution, but the actual contribution in terms of 50 BTC blocks goes to the miner. In addition, they get their "share" of the pool based on their "contribution".Of course, both the ethical and practical problem is that the pool will not generate anything if everyone does this. But suppose that some are already doing it. In the long run, statistics may show who is cheating, but it is not obvious in the short term. Cheers, got mine too  If you want to go technical, you might start with hash functions:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_functionBitcoin is trying to find messages that produce a certain kind of hash. It is hard to predict which messages work, and you have to try a large number of them. Bitcoin is designed to give a predictable average between positive results, but the individual timings cannot be predicted. I am also wondering what is so special/secret/difficult about sending the rewards.I am somewhat skeptical about pooled mining in general, mainly because a centralized pool goes against the distributed P2P nature of Bitcoin. However, I like to try things out before judging anything.Unfortunately, this is giving me a negative experience. If I have to wait for my reward for several days, I could just as well use my local miner and get a full block in a similar timeframe. GSM is a completely digital system. It should be possible to send this data over something like SMS, instead of using multiple D/A/D conversions that include lossy compression. Bitcoin uses SHA-256 which takes about twice the time for SHA-1.As for decibels and Celsiuses, see my other post:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2196.msg31306#msg31306 Meet my fanless miner:http://iki.fi/teknohog/hardware/nanite/I plan to add another fanless GPU to this system. For example a HD5750 has about double my current hash rate, so it would triple the overall rate. This needs some power supply upgrades as well, but that can also remain fanless.Actually, this is not strictly fanless. I have added a large and slow fan to be on the safe side. I cannot normally hear it under the slight noise of laptop hard drives. First of all, going back to commit 99c57637ca0d1db70187 fixes the issue, so the problem seems to be isolated to the last revision.The system is a Gentoo Linux, kernel 2.6.36.1, with catalyst 10.11 drivers and SDK 2.2. I have not tried any other performance options besides -v and -f 1.Work size 256 seems to bring the performance back to the expected levels, or at least very close. I should probably keep trying more of these options Edit: I chose 256 as it is the default/maximum for my card. Smaller powers of two seem to work better, -w 64 gives 63.0 Mhash/s.Edit 2: It seems I had failed to update back to the latest version for these tests (I'm a complete newbie with git ). The issue with the latest version is not much improved by the -w options. The latest revision seems to have a problem with vectors. So far, I get about 59 Mhash/s without, and 60.7 with, on a HD5570. However, the latest version slows down to 53.7 with vectors, while it stays at 59 without them. Finland
Agreed. I think private mining pools are OK, but the idea of p2p pooled mining sounds like an attempt/desire to reinvent the entire protocol. The bitcoin network is already a distributed p2p miner, it just happens to create money in blocks of 50 for sound technical reasons. One possibility for a separate GUI could be a web interface. That way there is no need to maintain a separate GUI codebase in sync with the daemon features. Many daemons such as CUPS and I2P already use the web browser as their primary interface.I am not sure if it is the best for mass adoption, though. There could be conceptual problems; for example, if you are not familiar with the idea of "localhost", and you could not tell the difference between a web page out there and a program running on your own machine. Handling your money via the browser also has a lot of potential for security risks. This has happened to me every time a hash with zeros is found on my 64-bit Atom system:Code:DBG: found zeroes in hash:d624b64665519a6e0c74eeca4e00a5be937086db86f106b0ed6e759400000000HashMeter(2): 8150287 hashes, 123.22 khash/secPROOF OF WORK FOUND?  submitting...  *** buffer overflow detected ***: ./minerd terminated======= Backtrace: =========/lib/libc.so.6(__fortify_fail+0x37)[0x7f6a2387f847]/lib/libc.so.6(+0xe56c0)[0x7f6a2387d6c0]/lib/libc.so.6(+0xe4a39)[0x7f6a2387ca39]/lib/libc.so.6(_IO_default_xsputn+0x81)[0x7f6a23809651]/lib/libc.so.6(_IO_vfprintf+0x3f6f)[0x7f6a237ddbef]/lib/libc.so.6(__vsprintf_chk+0x9d)[0x7f6a2387cadd]/lib/libc.so.6(__sprintf_chk+0x7f)[0x7f6a2387ca1f]./minerd[0x401958]/lib/libpthread.so.0(+0x6c1a)[0x7f6a23b04c1a]/lib/libc.so.6(clone+0x6d)[0x7f6a2386992d]I mentioned the problems with -march=atom CFLAGS previously, but this does not go away when changing the -march. Cheers, this is now faster than mainline on an Atom D510  While a GPU miner is hogging one core, mainline gives about 305 khash/s, and cpuminer gives about 480. Both of these are using several threads for HT, which actually makes a huge difference.One reason may be that the mainline client segfaults with -march=atom (gcc 4.5.1), but for cpuminer it works fine. Since the Atom has an in-order architecture, this again makes a big difference. Should I use a particular version of jansson? I installed it from git, and get the following compile error:Code:util.c: In function json_rpc_call:util.c:133:2: warning: passing argument 2 of json_loads makes integer from pointer without a cast/usr/local/include/jansson.h:188:9: note: expected size_t but argument is of type struct json_error_t *util.c:133:2: error: too few arguments to function json_loads/usr/local/include/jansson.h:188:9: note: declared here I have used https://www.bitcoinexchange.com/ with great success, to sell bitcoins for cash.

Similarly, my HD5570 shows about 400 Mhash/s with -s, which is quite an improvement from the usual 60  It has succesfully generated blocks on the test network, but much slower than expected.

Without a model number it is impossible to tell what kind of a processor it is. A 3.0 GHz Xeon could have a Pentium 4 architecture, which is not particularly efficient. Having the getwork RPC in mainline would be a good start, though there are known technical problems with that.GPU mining itself can be a little tricky with libraries and drivers. It would have to be a compile-time option, and binaries would have to be provided with and without it. But this would be needlessly complicated for a core client. Once we have a standard mining interface, it would be easier to separate mining from the core client altogether. My bank -> Online computer store -> new graphics card -> a slow stream of bitcoinsDoes this count? Somehow this is more fun and rewarding than buying bitcoins directly. A great excuse to play with new hardware, while knowing you support the network.I also have good experiences with bitcoinexchange.com. They are based in my country, so bank transfers are quick, but it should be equally convenient throughout the Eurozone.

I generally choose small and low-energy systems anyway, and these days you can find Mini-ITX/DTX motherboards with fanless CPUs and a PCIe slot. For my latest machine with Bitcoin in mind, I got a Zotac NM10-DTX and a Radeon HD 5570. Completely fanless, powered by an 80-watt adapter and a PicoPSU, generating at 61 Mhash/s.If Bitcoin generation is at all profitable, I might expand this with a second, faster (but still fanless) Radeon, but that would require a new PSU as well.For maximum Mhash/s per USD or watt, you can probably find better combinations. However, I live in a single-room apartment and I like to keep my computers quiet. 58 Mhash/s at -f 2 after 15 minutes.May I suggest that you calculate the hash rate over an interval of a few seconds, rather than the entire running time? This would make testing much more convenient. Also, I am interested in a little justification for the "should be faster" part, especially if the OpenCL kernel remains unchanged  The newest build does not give any noticeable improvement. I probably won't be testing this one very much, since the other implementation works well on my system, and I only have this one GPU for mining. Gentoo Linux. There may be some bus/CPU issues here, since my system has an Atom D510, and only 1x PCIe slots. On my Radeon HD 5570, the hashing rate is about 35 Mhash/s after 10 minutes. It seems to have increased slowly and ever slower, apparently it is calculated over the total running time. m0mchil's version gives 52 to 61 Mhash/s depending on settings. 59.5 Mhash/s on a Radeon HD 5570. Cheers to m0mchil Edit:This is using --frames 1. With the default frames, I only get about 52 Mhash/s.After updating the Radeon Linux drivers from 10.9 to 10.10, the rate decreased slightly to 59.2. However, I then tried the vectors option, which gave a small boost up to 60.65 Mhash/s. The motherboard only has 1x PCIe slots, which may affect things. Cheers  I'll have to try this once the Nano arrives. Is the C7 code still available somewhere? The above IP address does not work. I am getting a Via Nano system, and this would be interesting for playing around and learning (an old version is fine), even though there are much better hardware choices for serious mining.
