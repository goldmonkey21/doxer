I'd like out of here please. I've been a member of the boards since July of last year before the newbie requirements were established. Thank you. You would use the regular bitcoin client to make this transaction. Tradehill is for the trading of bitcoins for actual currency on its own market, not between other websites. You need to buy and sell 100 BTC just to make 10 cents. The system will stabilize as soon as trading is enabled, and things such as this won't be possible. Mind sending me one of those xeons? I could use a nice home server hahaÂ   Run Code:tail -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/Bitcoin/debug.logYou'll see if its using your card as an extra thread, will also show it initializing the OpenCL program.
