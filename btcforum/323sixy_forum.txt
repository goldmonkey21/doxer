No idea, actually... it comes straight in from their ticker feed - https://api.tradehill.com/APIv1/USD/TickerThanks for the donation! :-) Yeah, site dropped for a bit earlier today.... back up now. Sorry about that! New for today, a TradeHill ticker gadget...http://www.google.com/ig/directory?url=sixy.com/gadgets/tradehill.xml I just wanted to share that I finished writing a Mt. Gox Google Gadget for use on iGoogle, Blogger, etc. It updates data every 5 minutes. Link to the Gadget in the Google directory:http://www.google.com/ig/directory?type=gadgets&url=sixy.com/gadgets/mtgox.xmlLink to the Gadget on my website:http://sixy.com/software/mt-gox-google-gadgetComments, suggestions, and especially donations are greatly appreciated! 1LqGg4Qb7qZW6EKpL2YN42SDpfk5vGUv4j Okay, thanks! If I have 5 computers generating coins, can I make them all go into the same wallet automatically (accessible from any of the 5) or will I need to periodically send myself coins to get them all into a single location?
