Each month has an illustration and a quote (except aftermath, because there is nothing) that are all CC as much as I can tell.Donate if you want to.http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7NQMIYBJ Is there any way to remove bitcoin addresses that you have generated for yourself? What about if you have received payments to those addresses? Are they needed to show ownership for the coins after they have been transferred? I am planning on getting a dedicated website for this, maybe a tor hidden service, but anyway.I am a university student and I highly believe in free education, so I will be gradually uploading the notes from all of my classes so that the general public can become more educated. This is just the beginning of my notes, and as I am a psychology major, the next upload sprees will be specializing more in psychology with the higher level courses.I am not going to charge anything, however, bitcoin donations would be appreciated.If you wanted to donate to me, here is my address: 1JfyQHPFQoMnyWUmUeLzm6zbi1Rc3hGrKYPsychology101: http://rapidshare.com/files/359091364/Psyc_101.zip.htmlFamily: http://rapidshare.com/files/359091228/Family.zipChinese Culture: http://rapidshare.com/files/359094826/Chinese_Culture.zip
