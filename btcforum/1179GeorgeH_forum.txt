X Sorry, nothing here. I'd definitely look into it if I had one though. I'm sure there is a decent amount of FPGA password cracking information available. May be useful for a password cracking setup. For my entry, I'd like to toss a bone to the ReactOS project.I'm not involved, but I like the project. Thanks for any donations!1PWiRE16PJsEuax2Yr7EuK93q3ueDB58AE I'm tempted. Any pictures? I'd like to buy two of Dell's new U3014 monitors with 5 year accidental warranties. Neither BitcoinStore nor BitcoinBlaster have any plans to stock these displays.Price in USD is $3295.98. If you're interested in having such a device designed, I'd be interested in contracting.Primary plan of attack would be a PIC32 doing USB HID+MSD with an EEPROM. Nothing revolutionary.The PIC32 toolchain isn't entirely open, but the compiler is open and all required tools are cross platform. The PicKit3 programmer is available for $45. Clones exist if you want to save money. (IMHO they're not worth the trouble, but it's your prerogative.)The parts list would look something like this:uC: http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/PIC32MX230F064B-I%2FML/PIC32MX230F064B-I%2FML-ND/3046648Display: http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/NHD-12232KZ-NSW-BBW-P/NHD-12232KZ-NSW-BBW-P-ND/1701265Serial EEPROM (multiple for redundancy?)Buttons: http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/MJTP1138BTR/679-2415-1-ND/2344168 (A shorter button would be used if you want keycaps)USB connector: http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/48037-0001/WM17117-ND/857603Estimated BOM price is about $25 with PCBs.Potential issues:Security. Are you looking for encryption and authentication? How about hardware security?Size. The display is going to make a big difference here. What content do you want to display?Case. I can 3d print cases, but they're neither as pretty nor as durable as injection molded cases.Write only. A tamper proof write only setting would take some extra effort. How permanent does this need to be?What's your desired capacity?Software. USB software is generally painful to develop.E: \/ John, that post made me search around for an upvote button. Looks like a great product! Any guesses on the size of those fans? I'd be preemptively buying aftermarket GELIDs. Heh, why not 1GE5YtrmHXmmPPXUySPvuWjH9qanCB5Jbf Pictures? I this this is a really cool idea! Great site!http://witcoin.com/witizens/394 As long as you have the proper power supply connections (you should) and a motherboard with 2+ PCI Express slots (which yours has), the hardware angle will be simple - plug both cards in, attach auxiliary power, turn on pc!Every OS I know of should be perfectly fine with this configuration. Hi, welcome to the community! Just a quick word of warning - make sure you keep your laptop cool if you're going to mine with it! I made the mistake of failing to clean one of my computers and it subsequently died after a couple weeks of bitcoin mining. If you care about your laptop, just be sure to clean it regularly - mining bitcoins puts a huge amount of huge stress on a system; cooling is the key to keeping it safe! What's your average hashrate? I've got the same setup, but with Stream 2.2, and I'm getting ~315 mhash/s (as opposed to ~300mhash/s with Stream 2.3)EDIT: Mirror for Stream SDK 2.2 for Windows 7 x64: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=E7FU5U2E Thanks for the tips given here; I downgraded to stream SDK 2.2 and my hash rate jumped ~30 mhash/s to ~340mhash/s average.A note to anyone else trying this; from SDK 2.3 to 2.2, your device numbers may change. I ended up with my CPU as device 0, which was previously my 5870.It's possible that the solder on some components came loose when you were overclocking, but the solder has now reflowed.If it happens again (and if you've got some guts), you can attempt to reflow the board using a toaster oven. Are you running with the 4way switch? I have the same proc, and I'm getting ~20khash/s with pop's cpu miner. Or drop something into the x4 Busy sorting this out, all legitimate accounts will be rewarded in the end. Did a small transfer to a friend and saw no way to reverse the transfer. Beyond that, I was pretty satisfied with the service, it was speedy, clean, and convenient. I don't know, I just assumed he had a way to get to a bunch of phones. Meh.

At parties?40 BTC sent to kwukduckIOU goes to danknug for 15 BTC (My brother is gaming on my mining pc :p), IOU to kwukduck for 15 BTC as wellI have 12.10 BTC left in this wallet. It goes to the first person to get 20 accounts, and will be the last bonus. (the 3.00 BTC per account still stands, though!)All counts are reset to zero, I want to see who's really faster EDIT: Scratch what I said above, I'll give an additional bonus to whoever makes my 100'th referral. That would be, 29 accounts from right now. Good luck  15.00 BTC sent to danknugYou're eight tengths of the way there! Got tired of sending bunches of 3 BTC transactions to kwuckduck, sent 9.00 BTC to kwuckduckBonus of 10 BTC sent to kwuckduckEDIT: Next bonus of 10 BTC will go out to the next person to 10 accounts.

Kwuk, you're halfway there!EDIT: Danknug, sorry dude, but I didn't get a referral for bhurter82 either. No referral notification again, are you using different phone numbers? 3.00 BTC sent to danknug (for broberts1222, are you sure you signed up with my referral link for ryanyaw? I didn't get a referral notification for it, sorry man)And sure, keep going!

Cryptological algorithms like Bitcoin's are computed using integer math. On the flip side, ATI's GPUs have strong integer math capabilities. ATI cards generally have 4-6x the performance of comparably priced nVidia cards. Thanks, that was a good read. Sell it and buy an ATI card. 3.00 BTC sent to jesmurf3.00 BTC sent to alkor3.00 BTC sent to kwukduck01 3.00 BTC sent to sputnik Under my rough calculations, the highest end Virtex 5 could hit 40-50 mhps. At $3000+ for a PCIE dev board, it is far more cost effective to buy ATI video cards.Edit:Of course, if one were to connect a bunch of these things in parallel, they could make a big dent, ie:http://www.sciengines.com/copacobana/

Turns out, they handle donations for a number of nonprofit organizations. I believe this would be a great way to allow users to support Bitcoin - in addition, XIPWIRE is a promising USD<->BTC intermediary.While I am willing to help establish a XIPWIRE donation account for Bitcoin, perhaps it would be more appropriate if someone else (Satoshi?) set up the account.https://xipwire.com/info/nonprofit/howitworks/ 3.00 BTC sent to kiba 3.00 BTC sent to sgornickDavux, thanks for the info; added to first post. I will give 2 BTC to everyone who signs up at XipWire with a legitimate cell phone number using this URL: https://xipwire.com/signup/?xid=3525The bitcoins may not come for a couple of days, as I am currently sorting out an issue involving a large number of fake accounts.My XipWire account is currently in limbo. I will give out the promised bitcoins when I get my account back. You could try a couple mobile wallpapers, too. I'm sure many people out there would appreciate a nice android+bitcoin background!

Definitely not a long term solution, but it would hold for short term use! Personally, a 2D barcode is easier than anything, but its use is mostly limited to smartphones.An address shortening service would be pretty neat, but I don't think it would catch on unless automatic address resolution was built into the bitcoin client. Has anyone built this for windows? Ohh, I see! Thank you, sir. WOW!! I didn't know that was possible! Thanks, you just made my day (perhaps the next two days... seeing as there are only 25 minutes left in this one...) I'm in if you do this again! New PIF address for Smartzkid! I finally moved bitcoin over to my server; I donated my current coins away and will start anew from here 1KrPv3fP1D82dGjCGwHy8A8ewyDD6UcCa1Could someone explain how coins can be split up? The way I understand it, each coin has its own hash. This and the P2P nature of the system mean that imposters cannot 'make' coins. However, what's to keep someone's client from saying 'hey you, i actually own 99% of that coin'? Anyone have this running on windows? Oh, aight, no huge loss Good to have you back! (even though I don't remember you! I'm a this-monther to bitcoins)
