 mtgox need to have bank accounts, to have banks accepting to open ( and not close later ) a bank account for a bitcoin exchange is real hard, and you have to respect many laws, including AML laws , which means requiring Id docs for any suspect account. yes it seems some other clients ( java or python code ) do it, but the bounty is for the old , secure and trusted C code : bitcoind   hi all, Currently, if I have bitcoind running on 20 machines, or 20 bitcoind running on the same machine ( vps for example ), each of them need to download and store 2 GB blockchain, total 40 GB diskspace used and much bandwidth wasted to download it 20 times.Code: ls -alh .bitcoin/blk*-rw------- 1 neofutur neofutur 1.1G 2012-03-21 00:36 .bitcoin/blk0001.dat-rw------- 1 neofutur neofutur 401M 2012-03-21 00:36 .bitcoin/blkindex.dat The problem is the same for a vps provider like bitvps, hosting bitcoin users, 2 GB blockchain X 20 vps makes much diskspace and bandwidth wasted for no reason. Also the initial blockchain download is taking hours , often more than one full day . . .  Also its nearly impossible to use bitcoind on a small device like a eeepc ( 4 GB diskspace ), a phone, a raspberrypi . . .  I think the easiest way to make it better would be to have a "read-only" blockchain, one of the bitcoind writes it, and the others only use it read only to check transactions. Actually bitcoind is not able to use a read only blockchain, that could be written and updated by 1 bitcoind , and used by all the other bitcoinds on the same server ( in the case of VPS ) or mounted readonly as a sshfs or other secure network filesystem. I thought it could be simple and easy to hack bitcoind to allow this ( I tried ugly debugging on https://github.com/neofutur/bitcoin only to find its really not easy ) So, I start a bounty for whoever can produce a working patch or fork of bitcoind , allowing this "sharing blockchain" feature, allowing a service provider to be his own blockchain provider and save much diskspace and bandwidth. Also, the "read only blockchain" is just an idea, one way to implement it that seems to be the easy way imho, but you can also provide a better way to do it . . .another ( better ) way to address the problem, from gmaxwell :  The patch or fork will have to provide an option like "--readonly" at bitcoind start . the patch have to be a git pull request on github and be clean enough to have a chance of being accepted upstream. the implemented solution have to build and work on linux . I start the bounty with 5 BTC, and I know others will add btcs soon  Feel free to ask for details here or on #bitcoin-hosting channel : http://gw.gd/irc Read also : http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3199/read-only-blockchain-in-bitcoind-patch-ideashttp://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/2584/is-reclaiming-disk-space-already-implemented-how-effective-will-it-be Some clues ?

I mean, they cannot outlaw bitcoin without passing new laws <- they may outlaw the fact of handling bitcoins without being a bank(16:37) <@MagicalTu> if bitcoin is ruled being a currency, it means running your bitcoin client at home equivalents of running a bank at home(16:37) <@MagicalTu> and mining bitcoin could be seen as printing money(16:38) <@MagicalTu> the bank in front brought prints of bitcoin.org showing that bitcoin "is a currency"(16:38) <@MagicalTu> and other things(16:40) <@MagicalTu> this is unlikely to happen(16:40) <   ThomasV> why unlikely?(16:40) <@MagicalTu> because the way a currency is defined is not how bitcoin works(16:41) <@MagicalTu> so even if the creator & supporters labels it as a currency, it may be ruled as not being one(16:41) <@MagicalTu> and at this point we definitely don't want bitcoin to be seen as a currency  For now it works for withdrawals because mtgox is supporting the green address idea. As I understand it, it could work for deposits only if other providers ( from where you send btc ) also support/use the green address feature ( and mtgox trust this "other provider" green address ). mtgox and ruxum both have a BTC/CHF market  there is no more dark pools on mtgox for weeks not exactly : https://mtgox.zendesk.com/entries/20388551-lowered-trade-fees-and-volume-discounts no bad news . . . more or less . . .  just today exchb announced they are closing , exchb was one of the 3 most important exchanges and one of the most trusted . . . not exactly a good news . . . add to this all the FUD posted on this forum against mtgox . . .  "we at Tibanne K.K in Japan have started legal proceedings " they say "started legal proceedings", nothing more, mtgox dont own any trademark yet, and wont be able to provide  before they effectively have it.note to the european application : http://esearch.oami.europa.eu/copla/trademark/data/010103646 good and secure server admin and more : https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=1687.0 yes, this is called arbitrage, afaik many are doing it, you could also be interested in mtgox<->exchb arbitrage disclaimer : I m not a mtgox employee, but I m selling a service to mtgox ( IRC support and information watch ) ; the following is a personal opinion not related to the fact mtgox is also a customer of mine. Yes many people are saying bad things of mtgox, many also have a referral link for other exchanges in their signature . . .  Mtgox is a real company, based in japan, it works pretty well even if nothing is perfect. Most of the people complaining about mtgox are complaining because of AML ( anti money laundering ) limits. Yes mtgox, being a real company, is respecting AML laws, and some dont like it. Mtgox need to have bank accounts to provide a useful service, and banks ask them to respect some rules ( typicaly AML systems ) to keep the accounts opened. The important point for me is that mtgox is a real company, with a public whois, they wont disappear with your money like it happened with mybitcoin or moonco.in and others. The worst thing that can happen with mtgox is having delays on withdrawals, the volume being very big, you can sometimes experience delays on SEPA/paxum/dwolla/LR withdrawals; those are just delays, your money wont be lost, mtgox wont disappear, thats the important point for me. Since Magicaltux bought mtgox from Jed ( historical mtgox owner ) they have invested much time and work on making it more secure, fixing problems, securing offline storage, adding yubikey ( One time Password system ) . . .  I sell a service to mtgox, but I m also a bitcoin trader, and I consider mtgox as being the most secure and trusted exchange you can find. If you are still afraid by all the people FUDing about mtgox, I also use ( and trust ) bitparking ( https://exchange.bitparking.com )  and exchb ( https://www.exchangebitcoins.com ) exchanges.  great work ! I needed this ( open source ) and probably many others too ! I added your work as example on https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MtGox/API , feel free to add more details  I hope people will tip you ! at least I will ! hum, you seen your signature on this forum ? "I OWN YOU WITH THIS !!!" link pointing to a hacking website ( i preferred not to click the link ) interesting article on :http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/3826/are-virtual-currencies-akin-to-trading-cards-or-the-way-of-the-future.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart       Private, Registration  AUTOMTGOX.COM@domainsbyproxy.comwhy use an anonymous whois ( I wont use it ) ?   for your information, the most advanced and supported goxsh is now the Optonic fork : https://github.com/Optonic/goxshhttps://github.com/Optonic/goxsh/networkhttp://www.goxsh.info/and channel #goxsh on freenode IRC server 2 answers : * http://bitcoincharts.com/about/markets-api/ then ctrl +f Historic Trade Dataand * to get all trades from the very beginning one would just call https://mtgox.com/code/data/getTrades.php?since=0  since it returns only 100 trades, and you can call the method again by passing the latest trade you have imported in since. its up for most :http://just-ping.com/index.php?vh=mtgox.com&c=&s=ping!http://www.watchmouse.com/en/checkit.php?m=3&c=jpcheckit&vurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmtgox.com%2F&utm_source=just-ping.com&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=jpcheckit do you run a bot on the same ip you use to trade ? or hit refresh 3 times / second ? you probably been hit by the prolexic anti ddos feature .
AFAIK, unrelated   I ve not met him IRL, but he s pretty well known on the bitcoin IRC channels, I talked to him on IRC many times. I do use and trust exchb, its probably the only bitcoin exchange with mtgox that is NOT using an anonymous whois ( domainsbyproxy , privacyshark . . .) which is an important thing for me, and one of the reasons why I use only mtgox and exchb. https://support.mtgox.com/entries/20353868-1-week-extension-on-trade-discounts-ends-on-august-16-23-59-59-gmt  I added an unfunded order to buy 300000 @ 8.7 and its not showing on http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD/accumulated_orderbook.png and not showing on http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/mtgoxUSD_depth.html are you sure of what you say ? looks mostly like one more FUD . . .   but fees are still at 0.3 until august 16https://support.mtgox.com/entries/20353868-1-week-extension-on-trade-discounts-ends-on-august-16-23-59-59-gmt +1  hum, imho he s more a group of hackers than a single teenager . . .  and why using anonymous whois domainsbyproxy ? to be trusted like mybitcoin and be the next bitcoingate ?   You burnt you coupon and wont get another insulting mtgox  The yubikey would have saved him from this attack, +1 from the 2 factor auth !  so . . . not interested Yes, except there are no more darkpools on mtgox for weeks 1 BTC offer.under which licence will you sell this ? pointing a lie is not making fun, its just pointing a lie  I can provide backup of your wallet on 3 different dedicated server, hosted in 3 different datacenters ( wether you are an individual or an exchange ) . For trust concerns you can check my gpg Wot and my otc ratings more on my bitcoin services :http://bitcointalk.org/?topic=1687.0  I can provide backup of your wallet on 3 different dedicated server, hosted in 3 different datacenters ( wether you are an individual or an exchange ) . For trust concerns you can check my gpg Wot and my otc ratings more on my bitcoin services : http://bitcointalk.org/?topic=1687.0  official mtgox support is by email and on IRC the urgent thing was to fix the bug and answer people on the official mtgox support channel on IRC #mtgox server chat.freenode.net more than 260 people had immediate answers on the IRC channel 260 people contacted the owner of mtgox on the official #mgox  support IRC channel and had immediate answers from MagicalTux If you had a phone number to contact us , you d have useless answers from an underpaid offshore call center employee ( and you would probably pay more fees to pay a useless call center in india ). mtgox support is by email and realtime on IRC , channel #mtgox, server chat.freenode.net this was a bug after a database upgrade to support multi-currencies soon. Eveything is back to normal now. an official communication will soon come. exactly ! you meet a guy in the street : "- hi - hi - you know I could be your bank, i m great, your money would be more secure in my pocket than in yours, you could be robbed. - you sure ? but who are you and where do you live ? - ah no, you ll never know my name and where I live, you should put all your money in my pocket. - ok, take it all, I trust you"  the 2 options I use, and feel like they are the most secure  :* mtgox + yubikey is a good wallet service* bitcoind on a secure dedicated server , you can connect with ssh from everywhere
 you should also check your firewall , you need to open ports to have the client working well  to be more exact :  thats an exchange -> yes like mtgox -> no  mtgox is a real time exchange, you wont know who is selling you bitcoin and the seller cant be  scammed by the buyer ( reverse paypal for example ) bitmarket.eu is a p2p exchange, you will know the seller, send payment yourself . . . and you can be scammed by your buyer   Yes, the problem is fixed, but it could take some more hours to show up, progressively processing all the transactions that were stucked since dwolla changed the format of their CSV without noticing mtgox first. please wait a little more and fill a request on : https://mtgox.zendesk.com/entries/20248423-transaction-inquiries if its still not here within 12 more hours  Problem is fixed, once again dwolla changed their API ( CSV format changed again without any notice to mtgox ) , problem is now fixed .  Yes , its a known problem and it is in the mtgox todo list, It will be fixed, but there are just many more urgent things on the list. Waiting for this, use bitcoincharts.com :http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#vztgSzm1g10zm2g25 latest official update on this topic :https://support.mtgox.com/entries/20314481-an-update-on-euro-transfers-unavailable-until-next-week  +1, they had many more important things to do before, and tibanne bought mtgox.com only some months ago. Anyway its true they should add a "about us" link on mtgox.com, even if most people here know MagicalTux and tibanne co. false : http://legal.tibanne.com/ yes you can send bitcoins from mtgox to other people adresses, just use the withdraw option to send them when you send from your own bitcoin client, if the status is "0/unconfirmed" the trnsaction is not yet done, check your number of connections, and your firewall settings.   If you come to Peru, I live in Cusco, the city near machu-pichu , message me here on on the IRC if needed. mtgox API is working wellat least the actions listed on : https://mtgox.com/support/tradeAPIyou can also use the goxsh tool to make it easier :https://github.com/ahihi/goxsh  yup this maria is probably just here to FUD ( employed by a new concurrent exchange challenger ? ) hard not to see the big red warning concerning LR problems easy not to contact support, better spam bitcoin forums for more FUD please read :  https://mtgox.zendesk.com/entries/20239036-important-notice-libertyreserve-delaysthere s also a red warning on the mtgox website 4 new services for bitcoin users:* Secure backup of your wallet.dat :  your wallet.dat will be hosted on 3 different servers, on 3 different datacenters in 2 different countries  hosted on secure gentoo hardened ( grsecurity ) GNU/Linux servers ( scp/sftp only ) in big and serious datacenters.* Secure hosting of your bitcoin client : bitcoind by ssh, no generate possible ( or much much more expensive if you want generate option )* Secure hosting of your irc client : for trading on IRC #bitcoin-otc  ssh, screen, irssi* Secure hosting of your goxsh client ( see http://goxsh.info ) : This way you can access your goxsh from anywhere with ssh and its up nearly always ( more or less 2 server reboots / year )* bitfolio manager : managing your wallet for you, long term investment or daytrading options.PS : for trust concerns check my OTC wot : http://bitcoin-otc.com/viewratingdetail.php?nick=ne0futur&type=RECV&sign=ANYand my GPG wot : http://pgp.cs.uu.nl/stats/690B4E07.html  confirmed, mtgox rarely identifies himself, and rarely have his cloak ( he should and thats why I add information here ) , and he have a dynamic ip in costa rica(   ~mtgox@201.191.121.132 ~mtgox@201.191.120.137 ~mtgox@201.191.120.108 ~mtgox@201.191.120.103 ~mtgox@201.191.115.196 ~mtgox@201.191.116.152 and many more in the same IP range ) but yes it could be someone else if he s not identified. if you guys come on IRC to trade bitcoins, try to be safe and respect the #bitcoin-otc rules, register, identify, ask for a cloak for anonimity, get reputation, and trade safely !( ah, another good thing could be to remember your own nickname, the channel you came to and the guy you traded with . . . particularly to spend thousands of dollars . . . )Edit : someone on IRC asked me why i posted this, here are the reasons :1 - if its the real mtgox (and I m sure he is ) he will now know why he should configure his IRC client to automatically login on connect, before joining any channel ( to get his cloak and anonimity )2 - if its not the real mtgox,now he llknow there s someone ( a false mtgox ? ) who joined #bitcoin-otc 3- for everyone here to understand better the IRC world and and the security rules for trading $ and BTC on IRC4- I like anonimity, but mtgox is managing something big and have the "god power" to block an account just saying "better no one knows what I know", anonimity . . . yes, anonimity for a ~bank~ . . . not sure I like it  I have all the logs ( 9MB text log ) for at least the 3 last months, feel free to come and ask me on #bitcoin-otc  I think the best ( and more simple ) way to get bitcoins is to use mtgox , there are people selling MTG$ on #bitcoin-otc . You can buy the MTG$ with paypal or moneybookers, and then you can use your MTG$ to buy bitcoins at the market price.  I m interested in buying bitcoins at this price, please come in #bitcoin-otc channel so we can talk and make a deal . If you want a reputation, the reputation system in #bitcoin-otc is the best way.  I can sell BTC for moneybookers , come on the #bitcoin-otc channel to make a deal.   I m accepting bitcoins for all my GNU/Linux and web services offrs ( hosting, cdn, mail, seo, disaster recovery and more ).find more details on my dedicated post : http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1687.msg
 There s a disaster with your website or dedicated server ? You been hacked, the server is compromised ?  Your server wont reboot ? apache or mysql is dead ? Thats the best part of my job, saving you when everything seems lost. A typical offer is for a dead/compromised server with many services and websites on it, I ll get back all the data and migrate everything to a new and secure server within 48 hours for more or less   For the mail services I mostly use google hosted solutions. Here again I ll only charge for the setup , and after that its free for use. With this google hosted setup you get :* 50 email accounts @yourdomain.tld* each email account is like a gmail account, but @yourdomain.tld , each account have 7 GB storage space* POP, POPS, IMAP, IMAPS, forwarding, alias, catchall, mailing lists, shared calendars and documents, chat and more ( all the important email features you ll never find on hotmail or yahoo bad mail services )* you get an admin control panel to create new accounts, lists, add services, setup a catchall email . . . * google hosted antispam is one of the best in the world I charge  for the setup of your email system, I ll need the control on your DNS services ( the advanced DNS management at your registrar control panel for the domain name to setup emails )  I had questions on the IRC concerning my CDN offers. First, what is a CDN :http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network A CDN is mostly useful for big websites with much traffic and too many images, js, css files , the CDN will serve static files from different servers in the world, choosing the nearest server to the user requesting the static file. I m using google AppEngine to setup your CDN, the Appengine is free under those daily quotas : 6.50 CPU hours  1.00 GBytes outgoing bandwidth  1.00 GBytes incoming bandwidth  1.00 GBytes stored data  2,000 send emails  I ll only charge you the setup of the CDN, after that its all free ! This solution is great, and free, but pretty difficult to setup , my service is to make the appengine setup for your own CDN, I have 2 offers : : static appengine CDN setup, and I show you how to update your cdn, sending new static files to the cdn  : dynamic appengine CDN setup, using a homemade reverse proxy solution , the CDN will automatically get the static files on your website server once, and then serving them as a static CDN file. After you pay me the CDN setup work, you just have to use and enjoy your own free CDN ( http://static.yourdomain.tld or http://cdn.yourdomain.tld ), but if you go past the appengine quotas above you will still have to pay for additional CDN resources use :Resource Allocations: Resource          Budget    Unit Cost          Daily Free Quota ---------          -------    ----------          ---------------- CPU Time          n/a       $0.10/CPU hour       6.50 CPU hours Bandwidth Out       n/a       $0.12/GByte       1.00 GBytes Bandwidth In       n/a       $0.10/GByte       1.00 GBytes Stored Data       n/a       $0.005/GByte-day    1.00 GBytes Emails sent       n/a       $0.0001/Email       2,000.00 Emails  The free quotas are enough to serve permanently 5 to 10 requests/second with normal size static fileFinally an example of uptime for this kind of CDN :http://www.pingdom.com/reports/z91yt3rrqybz/check_overview/?name=staticww7and ping to the CDN from different locations in the world :http://just-ping.com/index.php?vh=static.ww7.be&c=&s=ping! I ll take the second one !  I was interested in alternative currencies ( well I m interested il all kinds of alternatives ), but never found one that seemed to be a good investment; bitcoins have all the important points for me :* seems well enough implemented and secure* Its made to be worldwide, not tied to a town or country* can be converted to real $* have an active and growing community* is already pretty big and developped, and it seems it ll continue growing* begins to be accepted for web services , games and more I wont say bitcoins have xx % chance to make it, taking the world is never easy, but it seems the best alternative to try for anyone interested in alternative currencies.  I could be interested, some questions :* I can ssh in, but can I also ssh out ?* can I use screen and irssi ?* can I use crontab ?* where is the server ? ( edit : oups its in finland and its a ADSL line, i missed this info)* is it a real vserver ?  another thing, I now have a running bitcoind with mining enabled ( -gen ) but with no genproclimit no crash until I set the genproclimit wether I have the genproclimit in the config file ( -genproclimit=1 in /etc/conf.d/bitcoin ) or when I set it via bitcoind command line the server crashes profile :
