Holy carp! This is getting serious. 13k? Really? I could make something cool for that kind of money. I've been eyeing this project for a while now. Is anybody 'almost done' with their version? I'd hate to duplicate any major effort.ps Bytemaster is totally *not* a scammer.  Just tried it but no highlights showing for me either...Ubuntu Meerkat + Chrome 8.0.552.18 dev Hey! Amazing work on the Chrome extension. I just tried it:It works from this forum but not from the (secured) Chrome extensions page - from where I downloaded it.If I click on a *bad* address there, it does give the usual error message but a valid address (ie yours) shows nothing. Odd.It sends fine from this forum though.

In Wine no less !Native client 0.3.3 = 602 kHash/s, MSVC build 0.3.3 (+ Wine) 771 kHash/s.
