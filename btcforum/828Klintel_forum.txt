Fife here (middle of nowhere, between Tacoma and Federal Way). 1) I only found out about bitcoins on 08/16/2010.2) Yes3) Since I've installed the client. Except for the past two days while I was out of town while the power was cut to our building, or something.4) So far, I've gotten one block (on the 19th).5) I have no idea, so I'm going with "Just for fun." He means that there's clearly an untapped market, bro..Seriously though - there's nothing in existence, yet, that allows you to buy bitcoins using a mobile phone.However, there is certainly a few of us looking into ways to make this happen.

Hi Vess,I'll assume you already have the MSVC redistributable package downloaded, but you might only have the x86 architecture.Try downloading the latest x64 package here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=BD512D9E-43C8-4655-81BF-9350143D5867&displaylang=enAlso, before you do that, you may want to remove MSVCR100.dll that you added to you system32 directory. Windows 7 has a specific way of registering .dll files than XP did (especially when there are several different versions of the same file), so this is not actually good practice any more.This should solve your issue. Good luck!
