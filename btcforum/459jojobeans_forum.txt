I made a sizeable donation to the EFF when they first announced their acceptance of bitcoin donations so I would offer a 10 bitcoin bounty on this project if someone could develop a way to refund the bitcoins easily so Gavin doesn't have to manually go through them.  This code would be handy for other initiatives or startups that get discontinued and the original investors can recoup some of their investment.There is no good answer I can think of for people that who donated using an intermediary, unless the intermediary would be willing to refund the bitcoins back to the address that was sent to them.  At least for those that donated directly they can get the refund by returning the bitcoins to the address the donation was received from.As someone who did donate to the EFF I am disappointed they made this decision but I understand it as well.  I would appreciate a refund of the bitcoins I sent so I could send them to other projects that could help with gathering mainstream usage of bitcoin or serve the community rather than a freebie handout to whoever has the biggest botnet. Excellent news, hopefully this will help give people more confidence in Mt. Gox. It's coming up here just fine. Right, as long as the noise is limited to the newbies forum it keeps the main forums much cleaner without all the crap posts like 90% of the stuff in here.  You gotta do what you gotta do. I've been following the bitcoin scene for quite some time but never formally introduced myself.  The name is JoJo and I'm glad to be here and get back involved. I've been a member for quite a while as a lurker and while i find bitcoins fascinating and follow discussions I haven't had an opportunity to contribute meaningfully so i haven't added to the noise.  With the recent decision by the EFF to discontinue taking bitcoins I would like to contribute to that thread and discussion but am unable to do so.  Please change my status, thanks!
