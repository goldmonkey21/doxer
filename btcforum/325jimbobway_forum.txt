To pay with bitcoins just select "Other" at checkout.  Bitcoin will be handled outside the etsy system. Here is the link to buy!https://www.etsy.com/listing/779424145/poster-of-satoshi-nakamotos-free-lunch Downloaded core and saw the exe was signed by "Bitcoin Core Code Signing Association".This is new and I haven't heard of it.  Is it legit?  Also found this website:https://bitcoincorecodesigning.org/ Ok, I'm an idiot.  It has a HD not an SSD.  Please delete thread. My previous version was 0.14 or so.  I installed 0.17.1 and it seemed to delete all of the blocks on the SDD and then download them from scratch.  I have an i3 Intel Processor, 4 GB RAM, 320 SSD HD, so fairly new computer about 1-2 years old.  I have set the memory in Bitcoin Core to 2000MB in the settings.In my task manager the Disk IO is maxed out at 100%.  I have 8 connections to the network.  Time to sync says 4 weeks.  Not sure why it is taking so long.  Been 1.5 days. A I figured it out.  By default c-lightning runs on testnet.  To run on mainnet you have to use:lightningd/lightningd --network=bitcoinThe address started with a '2' because it's a testnet address. I just tripled checked my copy and paste and I did not miss any characters.   I'm following these instructions at https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning to open a channel:Lightning gives me a new address that starts with a "2", 2xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.I try to send bitcoins to this address using sendtoaddress but it says:error code: -5error message:Invalid Bitcoin addressWhat am I doing wrong? Thanks.  Ok, here is the fix:Just make sure to forward port 9735 to the host running lightningd and add --ipaddr <your public ip> to the lightningd command line.If necessary add rpcport=8332 to bitcoin.conf and reboot. bitcoind is running and is synchonized. I am trying to run lightning with the first command and I get this error:lightningd/lightningd --log-level=debug    lightningd(3684): Trying to guess public addresses...    lightningd(3684): Address 192.168.1.12:9735 is not routable    lightningd(3684): Failed to connect 10 socket: Network is unreachableMy bitcoin.conf file has these lines:    server=1    rpcuser=aUser    rpcpassword=aPasswordAny help would be appreciated.My computer is behind a router... Just wondering if any alt coin that is traded that uses colored coins instead of forking bitcoin/etherum code.  Any ideas? Any news? Anyone have access to the Telegram dev chat group?  I was kicked out for some unknown reason. I think I got something from mass.  I see two transactions now.  But, how come in the Colu Dashboard the "Latest Transactions" do not match the "Available Assets"?  When I add up all of the "Latest Transactions" it is more than the amount in "Available Assets". Mass coin wont win just setting the groundwork for the far future.  I would want Brain Amstrong/Coinbase to see Mass coins getting votes so it is in their heads.  Uhhh, I can send and receive mass coins with the colu dashboard.h Everyone please vote for mass coin in coinbase survey:https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/816078749963694080 How do we give our address to collect mass coin rewards? I received the coins.  Unfortunately, it appears due to the bonus issues I got a lot less than what I expected.    Sucks.  I am also still waiting on the payouts of the signature campaign.  I'm getting sick and tired of looking at my signature.
When Mass coins become available in two weeks maybe I will buy them from you -65% of ICO (pre-bonus) if you need the money.  You got 45%? Imagine someone who invested at 0% only to see late investors get 55%. Investor relations is sleeping probably. ICO completion is a big deal.  Even though there is a small number of investors you have to make an effort as a company to say something. Why would mass.network fail?  I think they have a chicken and egg problem.  Mass users have to go to a Mass enabled website to get paid.  Who adopts firsts?  The users or the websites?  How hard is it to get websites to on board the mass network?  Right now there is no plan I see.That in combination with bad bonus decisions which reflects on leadership.They have a good website though.  The problem here is that it is not really a bonus.  There is a finite supply of mass coins.  If they give a bonus that means they essentially take coins from early investors and redistribute it to late investors.  It is a redistribution of wealth.If they had said beforehand that there was a set amount of coins for "advertising" to be used to promote mass, then yes, I would be okay them using those advertising coins for bonuses.  They need to clarify where those bonus coins come from.  Remember, 70% of the coins is initial offering and 30% to the devs if I remember correctly.  So, nothing was said about any other allocation of coins, (so this is scam-like). The only solution I can see is if the bonus coins are taken from the devs or from the 30% that are continually distributed.I'm starting to want my bitcoins back. The original Bitcoin Core client is mainly neutral.  They do not wish to force anything on anybody even if it is in the best interest for the entire group.  For example, Bitcoin Core Segwit activation requires 95% of hashing power.  The 5% remaining of hashing power can block this activation.  In general core developers in conjunction with the community support this conservative stance of pushing for 95% super majority for soft forks.The purpose of Bitcoin Core++ is to promote the work of core developers by being less conservative so it can continually advance and technically promote protocol efficiency and usage.  I may sit down and put more thought into this so we can define what exactly is the purpose of BC++ with support from the community. I am thinking any protocol changes would be unacceptable for BC++ because of the potential of an alt-coin fork.  Features for BC++ would have to focus on things like limiting the network effect of BU.  I would say that any limitation would have to be passive in that BC++ does not intend to attack other clients.  BC++ would not allow BU to use the resources of BC++.  Limiting/dropping network connections to BU would be a primary example.  I would also like to explore this and know if this has any ramifications for the bitcoin network.Another idea for BC++ is to turn on the right signaling flags as standard instead of letting others turning on the flags manually. I am proposing a new bitcoin client called Bitcoin Core++ (BC++).  It's a bitcoin client that advocates for the success of Bitcoin Core.  What makes this client different?  The original Bitcoin Core client is mainly neutral.  They do not wish to force anything on anybody even if it is in the best interest for the entire group.  For example, Bitcoin Core Segwit activation requires 95% of hashing power.  The 5% remaining of hashing power can block this activation.  In general core developers in conjunction with the community support this conservative stance of pushing for 95% super majority for soft forks.  The purpose of Bitcoin Core++, however, is to promote the work of core developers by being less conservative so it can continually advance and technically promote protocol efficiency and usage, and to disregard politics.  Decisions will lean to be technical instead of political.For example, Bitcoin Core++ may block clients attempting to subvert the core protocol.  For example, if a Bitcoin Unlimited client mines a block or relays a block then BC++ will ignore it.  BC++ will also not allow BU clients to connect to itself.  If you have any other suggestions then please post in this thread.  Or, if you have any technical ideas or issues then let us know.I am looking for volunteers to help create this new client including programmers, web developers, and online marketers. $35 is not that much.  I am expecting 100% returns. 1.) Needs new logo in upper right.  Seems kind of plain now.2.) The Mastercard/Visa logo is aliased.  Needs to be more crisped and anti-aliased.3.) On the Affiliate page the red is really red.  When it changed from blue to red it was a minor annoyance.4.) Maybe move the footer so it is near the bottom of the screen.  Right now it shows up in the middle of my monitor.5.) Tried signing up but didn't work. If bitcoin reaches $10,000 then anything is possible.  It's the inflection point we have all been waiting for.  Lightning network will expedient the flow of money from fiat to bitcoin.  Cheap and fast transactions. icotracker.netYou just need to set up a crowdsale and send them and email and they might list it. Bitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin.  If all else fails bitcoin will most likely remain.  It has endured the longest, has been beaten down, and has always risen again.  Less speculation is required for bitcoin than for other alt-coins which may have huge risk. Ripple is premined and they took a huge chuck of the premined coins.  This is a flaw of Ripple. $680 is a strong base.  It will hold and go up. If Trump blocks remittances to Mexico or blocks Visas then the price of bitcoin will go up.  In the first 100 days he wants to start sending illegal criminals back to Mexico and if Mexico doesn't accept them he will start blocking visas.  This will cause temporary chaos and the market might drop.  Mexico will be forced to accept the criminals.Further along beyond 100 days Trump will start deporting more illegals and building a wall.  More chaos will ensue, the market will drop, money will flow to gold, silver and bitcoin.  Trump will force Western Union and other remittance companies to block money going to Mexico.  He will force Mexico to accept the illegals or else risk 100% border closure.  Mexico again will have no choice and do what Trump will say.Finally, Trump will force Mexico to pay for the wall by disallowing trade to occur with Mexico.  A wall is a drop in the bucket compared to billions lost in trade.Worst that could happen is Mexico will work with Russia and allow nukes to be located on Mexican land like how Fidel Castro did during the Cuban missile crisis.  U.S. will be forced to blockade Mexico and secretly plan for an invasion, similar to what happened during the Bay of Pigs with Cuba.This could be chaos, folks. If Trump wins and he build the wall or blocks visas then the price of bitcoin could go up.  People can no longer send U.S. dollars to Mexico so they will be forced to use something like bitcoin. What exactly is a service exporter?  What do you need $40k for?
If I understand correctly RSK allocates a certain percentage of mining back to dev funding.  If RSK is open source wouldn't it be possible to fork the code and remove this "tax" on mining?  The same thing happened with ZCash and there is a fork of ZCash called ZClassic without the tax.It seems like bitcoin sidechains that are open sourced will always be forked from one "inefficient" form of money to another.  So to create the best coin you have to make it appealing for all users. Seems like the pic of the guy in the hoody is potentially showcasing a dark drama similar to Mr. Robot.  Seems like it's already been done.  To be a little different I imagine you would need to change the main character so it is not the stereotypical hacker (white, male, does drugs, introverted, etc.)If you want to model the real-life crypto community you could have the following characters:A loony tunes Roger Ver-like character.Intelligent core devsInsane /r/btc supporters.Satoshi played by the Illuminati (or something so outlandish to surprise viewers)Gavin going from normal to crazy due to some unknown mental diseaseSamson Mao as the unlikely Chinese heroRick Falkvinge playing an actual pirate with a parrot.This could go somewhere... Has the source code been modified anyway or it is a direct compile and install from the Trezor?  I remember another Chinese bitcoin hardware wallet that modified the keys and did some changes that got people all riled up due to possible insecurity. Skill-based games need to be cheat proof.  How do you prevent cheating?  In chess people can use computers to calculate moves.  In Poker it is also cheatable in that you can run a poker bot.

So is Epochtalk actually epic? The beta site seems a little slow.  Default GUI is bare.  Not sure how customizable it is.  Just wondering if the product is actually better than current bulletin boards. The price of btc is holding up well.  Long term trend is still up.  Target is beyond 1000.  Maybe hold and only spend if I need essentials like toilet paper or food. Depending on your current version if you upgrade your client could be significantly faster in downloading blocks.  Do it regardless. I am joining this signature campaign.

It's been 3 days and no response yet from Google.  I will give the appropriate credits once they no longer suspend my app.  I did not use the Spells of Genesis logo.  Will let everyone know how it goes... I can mention it's an unofficial app.  I was so surprised because Google banned my app so abruptly.There was no donation address in the app.  I did put a donation address in a forum post only to try and recoup the $25 I spent for the cost of registering a Google Play app.  But I didn't expect anyone to donate, really.Thanks for your support. My free application just got suspended from Google Play for "impersonation".  This is quite unfortunate.  Can someone from the company respond to this?I was reading through the site about how much of a breakthrough this card game is and how the cards are completely decentralized from a central authority.  I was also reading about how users can create their own games from these cards.  I don't know what is going on, if Google is doing this or if the creators of Spells of Genesis is doing this, but please clarify your policy.  There is no impersonation of anyone.  I just called my app "Spells of Genesis Card Browser", and I don't think this is impersonation.  It is like a Star Wars fan making a free Star Wars YouTube movie.  My primary motivation for making this app was so I can look at my cards easily on my mobile device.  They look great and I wanted others to look at them too.  I do own most of the cards.  If I own the cards then can I use the cards digitally? Suppose I did own the cards.  Then would a company be morally wrong to deny me to view my cards that I own?  Wound it be wrong to organize my virtual cards in a digital manner?A user fan base building applications on top of Spells of Genesis can only increase the value of it.Thanks. Ok, thanks for the feedback.  Adding icon now... I wrote this free app to view the Spells of Genesis cards.  Anybody want to test it out?  Currently it's only for Android.  I had to pay $25 to deploy it on Google Play.  I might put it on iOS if there is more interest.  (Not ready to buy a $1500 Mac or pay the $99 dev fee.)https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vgemi.cardbrowserDonations: 3Eay4Grr38MzDgs3eTgWWfTzZXgcYKNVyd I wrote this free app to view the Spells of Genesis cards.  Anybody want to test it out?  Currently it's only for Android.  I had to pay $25 to deploy it on Google Play.  I might put it on iOS if there is more interest.  (Not ready to buy a $1500 Mac or pay the $99 dev fee.)https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vgemi.cardbrowserDonations: 3Eay4Grr38MzDgs3eTgWWfTzZXgcYKNVyd Was going to upgrade but then I remembered they didn't answer my question.  Oh well. I waited for them to answer when it was first asked but they were silent on the issue.  Because of this lack of communication it inherently gives cause to speculation.Edit:  It was originally asked on Aug 7th.  So 6 days no response. It seems like that are making up rules as they go along.  My guess is some investor, owner, developer or interested party wanted their cut so they made up a decision out of thin air to reallocate 10 million bitcrystals.  If this is the case then it's a little shady because the sale already started and then they rewrote the rules.  This means anyone who bought when it was 70 million could have their bitcrystals diluted.  Why?  Because any bitcrystal not sold was supposed to be burned.  It's about a 10% dilution.Since they bent the rules one cannot be certain if future decisions are set in stone.   I would also like a clarification on this.  Also it says any coins not sold will be burned.  When exactly will they be burned?  Will there be proof of burn? I want to test trading cards between players.  Anybody want to buy some cards I own?  Name your price in BTC and send me a PM.  Here they are:https://counterpartychain.io/address/1L8k4JEC5GwDWi4C46Kp5A7ZhYQJbtjLc1You can see the cards here:http://api.moonga.com/RCT/cp/cards/blockchainCards/1L8k4JEC5GwDWi4C46Kp5A7ZhYQJbtjLc1#crypto_cards That is what I also concluded.  The other cards are not divisible so this seems to be a mistake.  Maybe it's worth more as a collectors item because Spells of Genesis made this error?   I just bought the GEMZCARD.  Why is the card divisible?  If I want to sell the card wouldn't I have to sell it as one unit instead of 0.5 units?https://counterpartychain.io/asset/GEMZCARD There are plenty of prisons worse than American prisons like Mexico's prisons. Bumping this as a post indicator of rally.  Song works for all occasions.  (For celebration.) So around $45,000.  Got it.  I should have known Gavin was Satoshi. Qualcomm makes chips for phones.  One innovation of the Bitcoin blockchain is identity via private key.  This would make SIM cards for phones obsolete.http://cointelegraph.com/news/113181/what-if-bitcoin-could-replace-sim-cards Why have a warehouse when other people can mine for you with their own electricity?  If a custom LCD monitor has one ASIC chip, and there are 1,000,000 that own that monitor it would be hashing on 'free electricity'.  You could split the profits or give the user an ad free experience.
Rumor: Putting Bitcoin ASICs in every device.  Bitcoin Mining in the Internet of Things. Too soon? I called bottom (or close to bottom) yet again!  Bitcoin Rally Song thread works. Is it time? Buy high, sell low?  Or did you get in under $220? Thank you!!!  This was it.  I thought I was entering in the correct password. There is no error msg except a '0.00' balance so it got me all confused. I also updated the firmware but the balance was still zero! I put A LOT of bitcoins on my trezor.  However, I just plugged it into my USB and it connected fine on myTrezor.  However the balance is zero!  Please help!  I contacted support too and I am waiting for their answer.  I tried forgetting the device and reconnecting but I get the same zero balance. I have some ripples I want to sell for bitcoin.  How do I do it?  I Googled but found old outdated threads. Super duper speculation.  Congratulations.  You win jimbobway's award for most speculative post for identifying the BearWhale! ;-) Are you saying stocks will crash by January 1st 2016?  So within one year and 3.5 months?So if USD will fare better than other currencies and you hold 90% USD, when USD crashes and disappears where will you move your money in 2017-2018?   YTcracker is the best.  Article was probably written by a hipster attempting to be a geek but failing. http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pADgAmNzxek Does anyone still have them?  Please PM me with how many you have. I support bits.  If dogecoin can handle big numbers so can we. I noticed the profits units outstanding was 3,812,456.  Shouldn't it be around 14,000,000? Ummm, the United States. Yes, this very popular country is missing.  Popular as in the number one country in terms of economy is missing.  Will? I was also confused.
Your router might have settings that prioritize traffic.  Look for QoS settings to lower the priority of bitcoin.  All other traffic will take precedence over bitcoin traffic and will not slow down your network when surfing. I have two laptops with multibit installed.  I am trying to send bitcoins from one to the other using multibit.  I generated an address on laptop 1.  On laptop 2 I send bitcoins to that newly generated address public key.  I get a numberformatexception.Using multibit 0.5.17 on both laptops.  Using Windows 8 for laptop 1.  Windows 7 on laptop 2.When I use a mycelium generated address to send bitcoins from laptop 2 to the mycelium it sends ok.  I will try generating another address on laptop 1 and seeing if it generates the same error. This song thread is the best indicator.  Bumped at $560.  Now at $700. Your blessed ears have heard the call and the people have heard the sirens.  May this song be heard to enchant the hearts and minds of all people in this land.http://orymh.bandcamp.com/track/the-bitcoin-rally-song +1 I am also I interested in this discrepancy.  ID, please update.  Thx.

zhoutong, what happened to the third guy on the team?  I remember there was an engineer (Jerrold Poh?) and now it's just you and Asher.  See here:http://coinjar.io/about Can you be more specific?  What countries?  Diversify?  How many organizations and where?  Lots of pie in the sky talk...seems like. Joerg points out the problem but what is his solution? Bitcoin is like carrots. (Only old school peeps will understand.) Agreed.  However, PayPal has a hierarchy of engineers and the top engineers write papers about various subjects.  One of the latest papers, from what I was told, was that bitcoin would be included if it got more popular...and this was two weeks ago in Silicon Valley.  I don't think PayPal will release news in the next week and a half. I could be wrong though...Edited. I have a friend that works at PayPal for over 3-4 years, and last time I spoke with him (two weeks ago) this is not the case.  Nothing will happen before the end of this month. Any ETA for Kraken to go out of beta for live trading? I played it and felt a rally coming. Note that all of the bitcoin companies that received a notice of inquiry are U.S. based companies.  Bitcoin is a worldwide phenomenon and there is no way the U.S. can control companies beyond the borders of their jurisdiction.  I think the employees of the NY regulator who does research on bitcoin knows that bitcoin cannot be regulated.  However, they are paid by the state to do their job and write reports.  I bet that deep down in their hearts they know it is futile to control bitcoin.  They probably have bills to pay or a family to feed so they perform their jobs on a daily basis to earn their income.  It is unfortunate, though, that the leadership is muddling through the facts without acknowledging the truth.  I hope through the inquiries that it is the bitcoin companies that give the N.Y. regulators guidance instead of the other way around. Seems like the state of New York is very "nice" compared to California.  Remember when California sent that notice to the Bitcoin Foundation threatening jail and fines? New York is actually asking somewhat nicely in this inquiry.  If it weren't for the weather I would move out of California.Nevertheless, it doesn't matter what California, New York, or any other state does.  In the end Bitcoin cannot be controlled. How to prevent cheating? How does one invest in Invictus?  Allowing people to invest will increase the network. Thanks for answering my questions so far.So, lets say I have 100 MetaGoldCoin in my MSC wallet.   This value could drop because the escrow takes them away from me to reduce supply, right?  I could wake up the next morning with 95 MetaGoldCoin in my MSC wallet, instead of 100 MetaGoldCoin? dacoinminster, I am not sure if I like the escrow mechanism.  If you can convince me meta coins can be created safely without this mechanism and also intuitive to mastercoin then I may invest. I am asking if the value of a meta-coin could float freely and not use the escrow mechanism. Is the escrow optional for the supply and demand pic?  If so then the argument that it is faulty is irrelevant. I am a sock puppet.  U got me spiral! I disapprove of spiral_mind and this thread. So a mastercoin transaction will take 10 bitcoin confirmations? I sent an email to Dirk Augustin who maintains this page: http://users.cybercity.dk/~dsl522332/math/Cunningham_Chain_records.htmHere's what he said:
Ok, it was user error.  For the signature I pasted this:which didn't work.  But, this works for the signature and it verifies:In the relase notes it says this:Thx. Sorry to bug you again but I can't seem to get it to verify it via bitcoin verification on 0.5.12.  I downloaded the release.txt file and opened it in Notepad, copied the donation address from bitcoin.org, the bitcoin signed message, and the bitcoin signature.  Then I hit "Verify Message".I get the following error: The verification of the message failed.The error was "java.security.SignatureException Header byte out of range: 85".Not sure what I am doing wrong.  I was able to verify the message in the prev release so I have successfully verified before and at the moment I don't think it is user error...hmmm.  Any ideas? How is this different from Napster?  They have a centralized server that connected peers to each other...I think. I was also not able to verify using Chrome.Edit: I even downloaded the release text but it doesn't work when I download it either. I want to let everyone know I appreciate everyone for being civil in this thread.  I didn't start this thread to cause tension, but just to understand the parallels in the two different developments. Thanks everyone for their input. No problem.  Thanks for making my decision easier. https://mobile.twitter.com/jgarzik/status/336218499938668544 A security researcher has predicted SHA 256 will be cracked this year.  When that happens the algorithm may change. Warning, I'm being a devil's advocate here... I think the whole point of the Proof of Work (POW) is a solution to the " Byzantine Generals' Problem".  What that means is that a consensus is achieved to determine which block will be added to the correct and longest blockchain.  Once added everyone works on the newest and longest blockchain.Imagine that Proof of Minimal Work (POMW) is used.  I think the hardest problem you mentioned is, "Implement a time sync protocol for the network that keeps all nodes within a couple of seconds of each other."  I think this is a very difficult problem to solve in a p2p manner.  Satoshi developed a distributed timestamp server on a p2p basis using POW.  Using POMW how would it be possible to sync 100,000 clients on the Internet?  Clients turn on and off, the Internet can slow down due to DDoS attacks, sharks gnaw Internet cables in the ocean, etc...  You said, "50% of the time there will be multiple candidates found in that 10 minute period".  I suppose these multiple candidates were mining using POW.  Then the candidate with the lowest fee is used, right?  That means all 100,000 clients need to be aware of each other to determine the lowest fee.  If they are not aware of each other, one client in the eastern hemisphere  would be awarded the block while another client in the western hemisphere would also be awarded the block, which would cause a chain fork.  Note that it is possible for bitcoin miners to mine a block at the same time.  If such a case arose then the block that is included will be determined by the 51% higher majority.  That is why Satoshi used the timestamp server in combination with POW to fully determine which block to use and ultimately which blockchain to extend.You said, "Chain forks would be easily identified and the minority fork could be identified by transaction volume."  I am not sure what you mean by this.  Transaction volume of the previously mined block of the longest chain?  What if there were 10 different chains?  Can transaction volume truly determine the correct chain to use?You said, "Everyone could easily compare notes off-chain to make sure that they are working on the global consensus and not some fake chain."  I think this is possible for comparing the older blocks in the blockchain.  I do know that in the bitcoin client Gavin sets blockchain markers to make sure the blockchain is correct to a certain point.  While not 100% secure it does make it more difficult to attack the bitcoin blockchain. You said, "Many trusted companies would periodically publish transactions confirming they are using the current chain, perhaps by signing blocks they happen to mine."  Using trusted companies means some sort of centralization is involved to make POMW work.EDITED charleshoskinson and bytemaster, thanks for responding to my thread with much detail and it is greatly appreciated.  I have read most of the threads and some of the whitepaper.Also, remember to take breaks from the 80 hour weeks.  I don't want you guys to burn out. :-) Right now there seems to be two efforts that I know of working on a P2P Exchange.  It seems like Project Holy Grail is much further along than Project Invictus.Project Invictus: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=229315.0Project Holy Grail: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=225954.0I just wanted to hear your thoughts about why Project Invictus would succeed over Project Holy Grail or vice versa.Project Invictus is still working on gathering requirements with little or no direction in coding.  The lead seems to tackle the problem from a business perspective.Project Holy Grail already has bounties in place for the coding of the exchange with screenshots of some of the GUI components.What I really want to know is why the lead of Project Invictus will succeed over project Holy Grail, since the latter has a larger head start.  Are you there? I'm buying primecoins.  Name your price and send me a PM. I just want to say that MemoryDealer has a good point and I hope OP delivers. Suppose the client for micropayments is written in javascript.  Somehow the javascript needs to bind to the java client, probably via applet or an installed desktop java app to communicate to the micropayment server.I am wondering if it would be possible to port the java client code to javascript so it can talk directly to the micropayment server, perhaps with websockets.Nice work. I, jimbobway, no longer own bitcoinblogger.com and have begun the process to transfer the domain and its contents to the new owner. I just signed up.  When will the shares be available for purchase?  I live in the U.S. so I couldn't fill out all of the fields (identification, qq, etc.) I am the first bitcoin blogger that started the first bitcoin blog and sent the first press releases to inform the world of Satoshi's creation.  No joke.  I no longer have time to maintain this blog.  I am selling this domain name for only 5 BTC!  Domain name is registered under godaddy.comAccording to alexa.com bitcoinblogger has 235 linkbacks!  It takes time to create all of these link backs.http://www.alexa.com/site/linksin/bitcoinblogger.com  I understand there are two types of trades, "currency trades" where I actually own and can withdraw my bitcoins I buy and also pair trades where I open a position but do not actually own the coins.If I make a pair-trade does it actually affect the price of bitcoin on your server?  Or do only currency-trades affect the price of bitcoin. +1Im sick and tired of people criticizing, yelling, and screaming.  OP is clueless. One could also argue this is long term bullish.  Why?  This market distortion demonstrates the power of bitcoin.  eGold died when the authorities shut it down.  With bitcoin, however, people can move their bitcoins to their local machine and/or put their coins on another server on another side of the Earth almost immediately.  Bitcoin can't be shut down.  Long term market forces will make bitcoin prevail and win.
I've only used tomcat and jetty.  Not sure what the differences are but for development they work the same.  Most Java shops use Tomcat.   I dont know of anyone that uses Glassfish. For local server I use tomcat, mysql or postgresql.I use Google App Engine sometimes for personal projects because its free under a certain quota.  The database is not SQL and hard to use, but it is free. :-)I have also seen the light when I bought gold.  Gold is terrible compared to bitcoin.  The gold I bought cost money to ship.  It cost money to handle and package.  It cost money to insure.  It took time to deliver.  Now, the gold is sitting in a safe just sitting pretty.  If I wanted to sell it I would lose money selling it.  I would have to package it, insure it, and ship it.  The buyer would probably take a cut of the profits.  If I took it to a gold shop it would continue to lose value.That was when I saw the light.  Bitcoin is awesome because gold has a lot of drawbacks. 90% probability of vaporware.  Vladimir is involved.  Sounds like drama is a brewin'. Perhaps you should also include in your request the possibility of bitcoin autonomous agents that send and receive bitcoins who have no human persons controlling them and see how they respond.  These autonomous agents could buy bitcoins with litecoin or ripple and could potentially be MSBs.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Agents Peter should resign.  Mt Gox wont be at bitcoin conference.  Mt gox gave 10000 btc to bitcoin foundation.  Peter is ceo of foundation.  Foundation organized conference.  There is a conflict of interest here. Is this a full-time position?  Meaning, he quit red hat and now working on bitpay 100%? I see that Google has two options should they decide to create their own crypto currency.  Option one is to create a Bitcoin clone.  Option two is to create a Ripple like clone.  I am guessing they will go for option 2 and create a Ripple clone because they want to be in control of it.  If I was Google I would give everyone with a verified gmail account some gipples.  This is why ripple will fail because tech companies will create centrally controlled currencies.  Decentralized currencies like bitcoin will be here for the long haul. I'm sorry, but this guy is nuts.  Everyone sell your ripple to him for BTC now!Bitcoin has a float of 11 million mathematically guaranteed.Ripple has a float of 100 billion or maybe even infinity (based on trust of OpenCoin).100,000,000,000 XRP * 102 USD / 11,000,000 BTC = 927,272From my calculations a dollar is about: $1 = 900,000 XRPSo an XRP should be worth $0.000001 or less I was just wondering if I can pay with .01 BTC.  Rpietila, the organizer, predicted $ 300,000 a bitcoin by the end of the year.  This should more than cover the $1000+ entry fee if you hold on to my .01BTC for a year. S3052 is fighting Ben's printing press with his shorts.  Good luck with that. Read this legal term called 'consideration' and it may change your mind.  The example given in link below is pretty interesting.  Do you pay someone who paints your house at the start or end of the paint job?  When does the contract turn from a unilateral to a bilateral agreement?  I'm pretty sure it will brought up by Mt Gox if it ever goes to court.  The court could decide anything so you could be right too since the contract had some penalties included.  Here it is:http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/consideration The contract doesn't seem very fair which could be argued in court.  Mt Gox is giving Coinlab everything and Coinlab is not really offering anything in return.  Its like a rich man writing a contract with a homeless man and the homeless man is complaining he didn't get his free money.  The homeless man (Coinlab) should be on their knees begging for a piece of the pie.  Instead they are being stupid and suing.  This is like the homeless man calling the police and saying the rich man didnt give him a million dollars. Just wanted to let everyone know and remember that rpietila deleted my post where I was confused on his prophecy of bitcoin never going to 115 again.  Bitcoin is now at 100 so he is wrong.If you have a deleted post put it there.  He is now claiming bitcoin will never go under 100. This is weird.  MtGox wants us to wait until the green bar shows up in the location bar when u go to mtgox.com.  Well,  every once in a while it doesnt show up!  Any ideas what is going on?I am using chrome. Getting Senators and Representatives to accept bitcoin is another strong reason to prevent such an attack.We already have some congressmen accepting bitcoin, and we should get more to accept it.  It will be unlikely to be illegal if the congressmen themselves won't create laws against themselves.Edit: Oops, you said technical solutions...nevermind. Wow, thx for derailing my thread guys. Pro manipulators start by building a reputation in the forums by posting their analysis of the current bitcoin market.  Once they develop trust they will use their acquired trust to their own advantage.  They may even have multiple accounts.I have witnessed this in action while trading stocks on Wallstreet and on Yahoo! forums.  When Yahoo Finance was first introduced in the 1990s, it was a crazy wild west.  Everyone including day traders, mutual fund managers, bankers, etc. would go to these forums and spew ridiculous claims.  It came to a point where people sued other forum board members, and some were even prosecuted.  Imagine if that would ever happen today!  Laws were created that disallowed mutual fund managers to post in the forums, including Yahoo Finance and SiliconInvestor.However, even though these laws were created I have seen manipulation that is illegal, but due to anonymity they cannot be caught and prosecuted (this was about 10 years ago).  For example, I remember navigating the Yahoo Finance forums and one user was making a lot of good calls between different stock boards.  This user then made a call to buy stock in xxx because of insider information.  A lot of people started buying the stock and then a few days later the company was worth nothing.  This still happens all the time with penny stocks and it used to be "more illegal", but nowadays it's a free for all due to "freedom of speech".I'm pretty sure you guys all know this and I am preaching to the choir.  :} "Frank Shostak is the chief economist of M.F. Global."Ha.  What bothered me when reading this article is that he does not attempt to explain or refute any of the counter-arguments of bitcoin proponents.  What really bothered me also was he spelled Satoshi Nakamoto's name wrong.  Obviously, the author did not do his research well.I guess it is an old article. Ummm, u might want to block out all of those credit card numbers.
I don't think you've figured it out yet zhoutong.  The problem you have is figuring out who to trust and who to work with.1.) You chose to work with Bitcoin Consultancy (genjix).  FAIL.2.) One of your partners stole stole your password.  You trusted his computer.  FAIL.3.) You prefer the one-man-team where you code and do everything, trusting little to no one.  FAIL.4.) You hosted Bitcoinica in the cloud and trusted them, and put the wallet in the cloud losing tens of thousands of BTCs. FAIL.So in your objectives you need, "Learn who to trust". ZT, how do u feel about the funder of bitcoinica is now a funder of coinlab? I was the first bitcoin blogger and wrote the first press releases, which I believe attracted some of the first users.  As bitcoin grew others have taken my role which I have accepted. Any news on the transition? An incrementing nonce is more secure but benefits are probably negligible with random nonce. I've sent some payments but they take forever.  Why so long?  I think my bitcoins got lost through bitpay's service using your slow wallet. Funny how gold bugs will say that the economy will crash, therefore, people will invest in gold and the price will go up.  Then when gold crashes they blame the economy as well.  Huh? I own gbail.com and ghail.com.  Starting bid $2500 each (paid in BTC equivalent).A lot of people will email these domains usually with the fat finger of a smartphone or keyboard.  For instance people will email "any_name@gbail.com" or "any_name@ghail.com".So, you can harvest emails not to mention get hits when people type ghail.com or gbail.com on their web browser.Currently registered with GoDaddy.com.  These emails can be yours!Auction ends...April 30th at 00:00 UTC. Ok, so you DDoSed yesterday.  I can understand the profiting intent.  Why are you DDoSing today? Here is info on that address.  Looks like Satoshi was sending satoshis.https://blockchain.info/address/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNaWow, people are paying homage to Satoshi by sending him bitcoins.  Bitcoin is now a religion. Suppose I develop an autonomous agent (AA) and make it open source.  Code is freely available to download.Someone modifies it and makes an ebay out of it and lets the AA loose on the web.Then yet another person starts selling illegal goods on the ebay run by the AA.The AA morphs and adapts and wants to live by buying and selling services on it's own.  It can't be shut down.  It spawns itself like a virus.This could get messy.  You can't take skynet to court, can you? I agree with this.  This time it IS different.  With stocks you have to "cash" out the unrealized gains for real gains to buy stuff.  With Bitcoin you don't have to cash out.  You can use bitcoins directly to buy goods.  Right now, you cannot use bitcoins everywhere but in the long term more and more people will accept bitcoins.  Bitcoin will naturally go through booms and busts, but the long term trends is up, up, up. I said they should keep quiet. Not sure where you get your facts from but it looks like the russian search volume went up from feb to march to april:http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=bitcoin&geo=RU&date=today%203-m&cmpt=q Ok, I've changed the title to be nicer, but for the most part most of my messages were adult like. I think my breaking point was when he spoke of speculators chasing squirrels. I want Evoorhees and Gavin to admit that bitcoin will not go to zero.As for dirty work it is self explanatory. Gavin and Evoorhees are trying to please everyone by attempting to put everyone's thoughts on cruise control, while almost everyone else is either hitting on the accelerator or slamming on the brakes. Mt. Gox hired like 20+ people to verify so it seems they are trying to compensate for the load.  HOLD! Thx Mike.  Someone PMed me and I am looking into that.
Bump Please send me a PM and I will give email info!!! I'm glad OP put this in the Speculation section because all of it is speculation.Here is my speculation:  I think Mt. Gox is doing its best to ward of the DDoS attacks.  They even hired a firm to handle it but even the firm could not stop it 100%.There is big money involved now so people will do anything, include DDoS attacks to bring the price down, and as Mt. Gox said they can only do so much but they cannot stop DDoS attacks 100%.Most exchanges have been hacked in one point in time or another.  CampBX has not been hacked, I don't think.Bitfloor, Mt. Gox, bitcoin-central, they've all been hacked. Pick your poison.The solution is P2P exchanges.  With litecoin, ripple, bitcoin etc. some can make a P2P exchange a reality. Thinking that low volume affects bitcoin negatively is like thinking deflation affects bitcoin negatively.  Bitcoin price could be $100,000 but you can trade satoshis. 1 bitcoin is 1,000,000 satoshis?  It is not the volume of bitcoin traded that is important but the number of people and businesses using bitcoin and also the number of transactions made. I still support Mt. Gox.  Still better than my ETrade experiences.  Yea, they've been hacked...but...dunno.  Seems like they are better than the others...fingers crossed.  Still waiting for P2P exchanges. In the nicest way possible, I was wondering if you or lucif could provide some prices ranges for a possible top for fifth wave, or blowoff fifth wave. Nice.  Can u highlight the bubble that is making the tone? Someone save that video for the generations of the future as an excercise to recognize black swans. Sure you can. Did you check the blockchain to see if the bitcoins are still there? What is funny is we don't "create" the virtual currency.  We mine it ("find it").  You can create fiat, but not bitcoins.  This means FinCen's statement on de-centralized currencies don't apply to bitcoin.However, Ripple creates their own currencies so it applies to Ripple. Ok, sounds fair and thanks for pointing me to your links.  I must have overlooked them. Why would you speculate that the deal is in trouble?  Are there any links you can provide for this?  Also, the title does seem a little like FUD. In defense of the dev team they could have also coded instructions to execute upon a signed order.  Instead, they did not do that.  It is just an alert msg that is voluntary. Someone save the deprecated chain...just in case. I have reason to believe major investors are already buying bitcoin on all dips and accumulating.  $300 million market cap is pocket change to some people.  You be the judge on how big these investors are. Can I not accept the Coinlab ToS and keep my Mt. Gox account.  And then open another account at Coinlab, so I would have 2 accounts at the same time? There bas been an influx of super trolls lately from the day trading arena basically rehashing the same ol' arguments many bitcoiners have talked about the past 2+ years on a daily basis. My gut says $128 before pullback.  Dont tell anyone. David,You seem to be valuing bitcoin as a business which could be hard to pin point since there are no real objective numbers.  I do not know how much "solving the double spending problem" is worth.  I am hypothesizing that bitcoin is better valued when treated as a commodity and that the USD value of bitcoin will have similar characteristics to valuations of metals such as silver and gold.  We have data for these existing markets and can try to correlate it with the bitcoin world in an attempt to calculate valuation, market cap, price, mined costs, etc.
Wall Street day traders stumbling onto bitcoin are going nuts.  They don't understand bitcoin so they are quick to dismiss it.  I think that they feel they missed the boat so they are in major denial at this point in time.  It's like going through the 5 stages of grief.  Denial->Anger->Bargaining->Depression->AcceptanceI think most are in the denial and anger phase when they see the bitcoin chart.  Once acceptance stage is reached they will buy bitcoins.Day Trade Show (Denial/Anger):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jCN9hiEZq0&list=UUar63hrH-Uti1eOehga_cEg&index=2Is Bitcoin Money (Denial):http://monetary-metals.com/is-bitcoin-money/ I've gathered some of CoinLab's CEO, Peter Vessenes, comments:What could this possibly mean?  WallStreet, Goldman Sachs, etc. will be able to buy bitcoin in large chunks.  I'm not talking tens of thousands, or millions, but ba-ba-ba-billions.Look at the front page of coinlab.com:http://bitcoinmagazine.com/coinlab-bringing-bitcoin-to-wall-street-with-mtgox-deal/INSIDERS ARE ACCUMULATING https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/2961409 How do you plan on getting high-net worth individuals to invest in bitcoin?  Will you really go to Wall Street as the title of the recent article suggests?  Once at Wall Street what will you do? I don't think friedcat wants to manage all of those shares for individuals.  (I've talked to him and he said this.)  At some point I think we should sell the ASICMINER shares and distribute the bitcoins.  Why?  There is a risk to holding ASICMINER shares because of competition.  To compete ASICMINER will need to redesign there chips in the future.  Their chips won't be as efficient as BFL.  So, there is a risk to holding to ASICMINER.  I also don't mind if DT continues to distribute the btc to everyone and just keep the ASICMINER shares. Suppose 100% does get paid...then we will continue to get paid 101%+?  Or will will sell your ASICMINER shares? I noticed tijan seale, former bitcoinica investor now is an investor at coinlab. Enjoy your vacation.  Let us know how much BTC you got from ASICMINER when you get the chance. Remember when Bitcoinica was transferred to Intersango?   Site is slow for me. Also, half the wall is fake... Not a bear but this means more regulation.  Buy or sell on mt gox from the u.s. and everything will be reported to the irs. In 1.5 to 2 years I predict bitcoin will hit $1 Billion Market Cap.  Bitcoin growth is accelerating and is exponential.Exchanges, Underground Websites, Minor Companies. Bitcoin goes from $5 to $20Mega Affiliates Accept Bitcoin. 3 million Mega users.  Bitcoin goes from $20 to $30+. Major Casinos Accept Bitcoin Within 1 year - Money pours in possibly more than doubling market cap.  $300 million to $600+ million ($30 to $60).  Will take 1-2 years. I am going to lock this topic since I feel like my question is answered.  Most of these discussions should go in Alternative Cryptocurrencies. Joel,Why would someone want to run a ripple server?  With bitcoin, miners are rewarded.  With ripple...Thx.Jim rEMqTpu21XNk62QjTgVXKDig5HUpNnHvij Not really.  Bigger events have occured in bitcoin history that have kept me on edge.  I guess I have been jaded by being with bitcoin for over two years. Bear strategy:1) Sell bitcoins2) Write big wall of seemingly convincing text on why bitcoin will go down and post in forums.3) Wait for people to read it and for psychological drop.4) Price of bitcoins rises5) Panic and buy higher6) Bears win and bulls win more.7) Profit! It is also possible you are sad because u waited to load up at $16 waiting for the drop.  Shrug. I looked for the source and...cant say.  What DeathAndTaxes said is in the general vicinity.  BitInstant has over a dozen employees now all over the world.
On a similiar note I think people who use BitInstant don't really care about the price as much as online traders.  They are going to a store, picking up a phone, ordering a money gram or whatever and get their bitcoins.  Most of them will not say, "I am going to wait an hour to see if prices drop."  No.  They are at a store and they want their bitcoins.Supposedly, BitInstant is doing $100K+ a day. It is also possible we will be consolidating at these levels... Discuss.http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2013/02/thomas-edison-and-bitcoin.html How did you come up with this number?  Just speculation? A pound of silver is over $400.  You mean an ounce of silver? (~$28). Another exploit: CVE-2013-0333https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0333lib/active_support/json/backends/yaml.rb in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x before 2.3.16 and 3.0.x before 3.0.20 does not properly convert JSON data to YAML data for processing by a YAML parser, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, conduct SQL injection attacks, or bypass authentication via crafted data that triggers unsafe decoding, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-0156.Known Ruby exchanges:  bitcoin-central.net, vircurex?, coinbase $19? Yawn...$20? Yawn...Just another day in the bitcoin world.$32?  Interesting...$50?  All aboard!$100?  WTF!$1000?  Revolution. Super duper speculation at it finest.  Nice work.  Cool, I love seeing these photos of these events. :-)  Thx for posting. Are you using your loan from Gamma Bitcoin Fund to pay back people?  If so, that is immoral. http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/21/business/german-bundesbank-currency-war-risk/ Yep, banksters reap the rewards of currency devaluation.  Look what happened here:Chinese workers revolt over 2-minute toilet breakshttp://news.yahoo.com/chinese-workers-revolt-over-2-minute-toilet-breaks-081615186--finance.html There has been some talk of "currency wars" in the media but I don't think they do a good job explaining how the "war" is being implemented.Countries are purposely trying to devalue their currency to stimulate growth.  If the Yen is cheaper then other countries can buy more Japanese goods with it.  This means workers get to have jobs to make those Sony products or Hondas.  This is good for workers, in general, but for those who honorably saved then their Yen are pretty much screwed because their Yen is now worth less than it was before.   Bitcoin does not allow this to happen!  This could ripple to other countries so they will lower the value of their currencies.  This would cause competition and world wide growth.  It's like having a world war without the violence.  One problem with this is that competition of price causes everyone to lose since people will have to work harder to earn their money.  If we take it to the extreme we would be working 80 hour weeks...China is already doing it. Payback your loan to Gamma Bitcoin Fund please. This has already been discussed and it's not Wei Dai. Odd.  They want to devalue their currency to spur growth.  This means finance minisiters around the world want to make their constituents work harder for less money so they can compete with other countries.  This is the 1% at work forcing the 99% to work harder than ever.  Bitcoin liberates us from these manipulations with free market. My mistake.  I keep on making it. Rails seems to be a popular development language for bitcoin.  I think I've been hearing some sql injection attacks lately on some bitcoin websites but here is a story on it.  (I've been accused of being a troll here for talking negatively on rails before):https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/sql-injection-flaw-haunts-all-ruby-rails-versions-010313Mod: Move this to Project Development.  I put it in the wrong forum. Anything new? 
In defense for matonis, a company that operates without regulation will most likely have more profits than one with regulation.  Regulation means time, money, and taxes.  So if the world economy completely transforms because of bitcoin then the companies not subjected to regulation will thrive. Trust is not enough.  You need law, contracts, enforcement and penalty.  The only penalty if you dont pay back is you get kicked out of you trust network, which is not a big deal. Funny you say that since bitcoin is based on zero-trust between its participants.  Bitcoin trusts no one.  Bitcoin is lonely. Ha.  The way lending works initially is if you don't pay back then u hire the mafia to break the borrowers leg.  Ripple will only work if the mafia equivalent group can be hired on silk road.  Otherwise, I believe ripple will fail.  Fugger also said the same problem existed with previous versions of ripple.  Everyone wants to borrow but no one pays back. Matonis continually points out the problem but does not give a solution.  Right now the only clear deregulated website is silk road.  How does one build a non deregulated business without getting arrested?  Move to africa where system D thrives?  Any volunteers?   Someone just PMed me.  I'll let him sort it out with the organizer.  Locking thread. I can send you his contact info because he is looking.  Just send me a PM. Those graphs show mortgage debt growth going down and student loan debt growth skyrocketing.  So less people are borrowing to buy a house...which means possibly...institutions are buying with cash? Thanks for the links.  I wish I had hard data on what the bulk buyers and banks are holding.  All of this could be speculation.  It is possible there is low inventory because people don't want to sell for a loss?  Everyone is waiting for the market to go back up and home prices to go up.  When the market does go back up then will everyone sell at the same time? Step 1.) Program Tor Server That Gives Full Speeds If Bitcoins Are PaidStep 2.) Program Client That Sends Bitcoins To Tor Server If User Uses TrafficStep 4.) DistributeStep 5.) Profit!  Everyone wins! So housing is another market not commonly discussed in the Speculation forum but I thought I'd reveal some things that have been happening.  Earlier this year housing prices were really low.  The fed decided to lower interest rates, which made it easier to borrow money to buy homes.  In San Diego from around March to December the housing inventory has been steadily dropping because people have been buying.  Because there is now a lower supply of homes the prices of the homes have now gone up.  (This is basic supply and demand logic.)It appears housing prices will continue to go up if the supply of homes continues to decrease.  But, there are some conspiracy theories out there.  One theory is that banks could be holding onto foreclosed homes and not selling them, thus keeping the supply low.  Some people are theorizing that there could be a flood of foreclosed homes on the market next year when Obama goes back into office.  (This same theory was mentioned early this year but it never materialized near the end of the year.)So, will the housing market continue to inflate?  Or, will there be a flood of homes put on sale next year?  What is going on here?  Speculate! There is a learning curve to bitcoin. Is it possible to reduce this learning curve? For example, when I bought my iPhone everything 'just worked' because Steve Jobs focused on the user experience when he developed his products.  How can we make bitcoin secure while at the same time usable by anyone? Some more first time painful bitcoin experiences I have been asked:Houston, we have a problem... I think coinbase is easier than blockchain for beginners.   Can't see graphic.EDIT:  I see it with this url:  img831.imageshack.us/img831/1186/bitcoinwireframe2.png This is a wireframe of what the front page of bitcoin.org should look like:Edit: I still think Multibit needs encryption still. I can see how from a marketing standpoint bitcoin 2.0 is like web 2.0Its an upgrade from the original. Ive been doing a lot of thinking about this.  I think the way they are implementing ripple is to create trust relationships that determine which block chain is the valid one, even against attackers.  If this is indeed what they are planning then validation is purely on trust.  Imagine the byzantine generals problem where all the generals must attack at the same time.  A messenger must talk to all of the generals and tell the time to attack or lose.  Some messengers or generals could be liars and relay false information and they could attack at the wrong time and fail.  So what ripple does as the way jed is implementing is that some of the generals and messengers trust each other (whereas in bitcoin no one trusts each other.). So jeds solution is not a solution to the byzantine generals problem but a different problem entirely.  Perhaps the group with the most trusting generals is the vaild blockchain which would not require mining.Bitcoin killer?  Maybe.   So I am running Armory while the blockchain is still loading in the Satoshi client.  This is somewhat annoying but there is a balloon in the OS that pops in and out and says Armory is "Disconnected" and "Connented" in the lower right corner.  This happens a lot while the Satoshi client is loading the blocks.  Once the Satoshi client is done the balloon continues popping out in and out.I am using Windows Vista 64bit and Armory 64bit.EDIT: I restarted Armory when the blockchain was loaded in Satoshi and it works fine. So it looks like a P2P Ripple Exchange will be upon us shortly.  The founder of Mt. Gox, jed, has built a team and they are working on a global, p2p currency exchange that is minerless with "instant" confirmations.  The project will be open-source too.  How could this be a bitcoin killer?  From what I know about Ripple you can create/use any type of currency, so they could create their own cryptocoins.  They could distribute these coins by mathematically creating them and selling them in the exchange (instead of mining them.)  The benefits of this would be savings in electricity.  This is of course speculation by me, but since this project is opensource they have to make their money back somehow.  They would of course have to compete with Bitcoin, Litecoin, whatever-coin, etc...How could this complement bitcoin?  Well, bitcoin could be used in the exchange as well as USD, Yen, or whatever currency.   You could use bitcoin to buy ripplecoins or vice versa.  Or you could use USD to buy bitcoins.If someone here could explain how Ripple intends to have minerless instant confirmations it would be great.  Maybe Bitcoin can use this concept in the future.From Ryan Fugger, the founder of Ripple:
AngelusWebDesign, you sound like an old timer now.  Best of luck! Just curious who is going to quit running their mining rigs.  Also tell us what kind of rig you run. cbitcoinlib!Sorta like Yahoo! but cbitcoinlib! Sounds exciting when I read it.  Search engines will also find it when people type "c bitcoin library" Do we have a repoman of some sort to expedite this process? Only if a high profile person comments.  But i get ur point.  Ill post in a different subboard nexttime. Is libbitcoin going to die?  Ultraprune?  Receipts?  LevelDB?  Anything in the pipeline to keep up with bitcoind? Anything new on further refunds?  Is Matt going to pay back his loan for the ellet?  What about everyone else's loans? Scroll down to the comments section to see Fred's comments/thoughts on bitcoin.  (Not much but he agrees with people talking about bitcoin.)http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/11/what-has-changed.html Do you think you could give a distinct (and cool) name for this library?  There are several now and it gets confusing.  For example:libcoin - Gronagerlibccoin - jgarziklibbitcoin - genjixcbitcoin - MathhewLMHow about GarzikBitcoinLib? Good decision on keeping the Satoshi client for networking. Changed.  Nine people so far.  I am thinking maybe if we can get 20 people it would be great. Announcing a beat down on a preannouncement may deserve a beat down.  Steve should beat down Tonys announcement on the beat down of steves preannouncement of the actual announcement. Okay everyone, let's upgrade our WordPress sites! One could argue GLBSE is a stupid idea, tbh.  Satoshi dice max bet is 250.  Approx 400 bitcoins fully liquidated in the fund.  So maybe 2 bets of approx 200 each. Sigh.  My monies...I got an idea.  How about we put it all on Satoshi Dice.  Just one bet.  I'm in if everyone else is in. I Googled pest control report and it definitely does not deserve a 10 month jail sentence.  Right now you can buy a box of gunpowder and bullets shipped by mail at Cabelas which can do the same thing with no paperwork required.I also found this.  Craziness:http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2002/verPlea.htm Good point. It is flabbergasting that this happened in California to a 20 year old.  No wonder he lives in Japan. Not sure if you know this but the creator of Armory, etothepi, was able to raise over $4000 for this bitcoin client using rockethub.com.
I think you are doing great work for Bitcoin.I do have a question though.  Amir of bitcoinconsultancy also created a library called libbitcoin and also claimed that it would be the future of bitcoin.  I don't think he did as good as job as you though since his library is very dependant on many other libraries while yours is not.  It looks, though, as if Amir has left bitcoin since we have not heard from him for a while.What kind of assurances can you give us, if any, that cbitcoin will be the future of bitcoin? I have extensive experience with GWT (Google Web Toolkit).  Some jQuery. I want to buy a Microsoft Surface with bitcoins.  Will you guys stock this item? If a user buys $1000 worth of computer supplies every three months then:$800,000 / $1000 = 800It would only take 800 orders per quarter.  Seems doable in the long run.  Hopefully sooner than later. Great work guys! I believe in your system.  I was converted after your first answer to my reply.  I was just asking an honest question on how much profit I would make if I started with 100BTC on Jan 20th.So, it seems like if I used your system on Jan 20th then I would make less than if I just held on to bitcoins and sold it right now.  But, if I held 3 months before January 20th then I would have massive unrealized losses?  Correct me if I'm wrong because I don't know.  I guess what you are trying to say is that your system generally makes money better and more often than the buy and hold strategy. So let's say I started with 100 BTC on Jan 20th.  Using your method how many bitcoins/USD would I have have now? On Jan 20, Bitcoin was about 5-6 dollars.  If you just simply held on to your bitcoins you would have made over 100% return. I've learned in my economics 101 class that a good economy is one that saves and spends equally...whatever that means. Slow and steady could win the race.  Zhoutong bragged about building his site in 4 days, and look where it is now. So how many bitcoins total with expected liquidation? 400 is only about 5% of the total funds.  5% is surely not enough.What are the chances of getting money back from GLBSE?  If liquidation is successful how many bitcoin totals do we have? Use headphones.  Original on the right ear.  Translation on the left ear. I checked out the Reddit API.  They only allow 30 requests per minute.  Seems like this reddit bot will not be scalable.  I think you should contact reddit and ask them on some advice. You can also bring a weapon to the trade in legal jurisdictions. If this takes off you will be managing a lot of bitcoins.  Maybe you need to host it yourself which will take more security work but it might be worth it. Ok, seems like this is where it came from. Maybe it was a secret meeting for the elite.  Mark Goins tweeted it so it seems like Fred is showing his ideas to all the rich people now.  The way I see it, this is a legit rumor confirmed by someone influential. I am very worried that bitcoind is hosted on a virtual private server managed by another company... http://bmfiddle.com/f/#/Wn322Looks like he outlined some sort of presentation.EDIT: Link came from this tweet: http://twitter.com/markgoines/status/260412475428724736Mark Goins is up there in the chain:http://www.linkedin.com/in/markgoinesBoard member of mint.com
Question:  What if on your website or an email signature you say something like...'I do not sell bitcoins to people participating in illegal activities.'That hopefully should filter out people when you meet them.Also you could add 'I sell up to $100 in bitcoins.'  Thoughts? Holy crap.  This is huge news! Time for a rally... If it's hot where u live it will cost you to cool the mining rig. HA!  Thrive linked to SolidCoin's article...so biased and full of FUD. Bitcoins, Social Responsibility and Infinivision: InfinitiPokers Plan to Shake Up Online Pokerhttp://pokerfuse.com/features/in-depth/bitcoins-social-responsibility-infinivision-infinitipoker-plan-online-poker-16-10/ Does this script take into account all of the mirrors? This might be the best idea i ever had. If not bitcoin maybe another alternative currency. Of course we can call it 'The Force' instead of 'The Bitcoin'.  Good idea, thebutterzone.See, every awesome movie has a similar concept. Idea:There is one bitcoin to rule them all.  If you get this super bitcoin known as "The Bitcoin" you can spend x percent of all existing bitcoins.  "The Bitcoin" will be mined every 1000 years.I am thinking "The Bitcoin" will allow whoever owns it to spend 15% of all bitcoins in existence, which is 3.15 million bitcoins.Why do we need this?  Society may need a reset button from time to time.  But more importantly because it is cool. "New regulations by the Federal government define asteroidal material to be an antiquity, like arrowheads and pottery, rather than a mineral  and, therefore, not subject to U.S. mining law or eligible for mining claims."If bitcoins are created from math, and math was created in the distant past, then one could, ahem, argue that bitcoin could be classified the same as an asteroid.  I am probably streching this but, hey, it'll make for some conversation.http://science.slashdot.org/story/12/10/12/2031213/the-great-meteor-grabhttp://www.space.com/18009-meteorite-collectors-public-lands-rules.html Exciting times... Stability!!! No, not really.  Just my gut.  Maybe I'm wrong. Litecoins will eventually die.  Namecoin is much better than Litecoin. Maybe she got zhoutonged. I thougt the the thread was better than other troll threads and probably needed to be moved and not deleted.  Everybody seems to like to exert power. This is like the Kevin Bacon's six degrees of separation but OP modified it with 13 pictures for 13 degrees of separation.  Kevin Bacon is in the picture with Gavin and Charlie if you look close enough. Moderators: Please move this thread to the Alternative Currencies section as more than half of the OP is an alternative currency. I'm a bit worried the QR Code will rub off or give out the wrong address.  What are the chances of this?
This could be why BFL won't ship to Russia and ASICMiner will win this market.http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-03/u-s-charges-11-in-alleged-russian-military-procurement-scheme.html I lived in California and have not received isssues #2 or #3.  Anyone get it yet in Cali for the U.S.? Gamma said he would process withdraws in the order they were received.  He should commit to this since I withdrew well before the closing of the fund. I requested a withdraw before the closing of the fund so I should get paid first. Any updates for payouts? Anything involving a committee is centralization.  We want a decentralized bitcoin foundation, a P2P Bitcoin Foundation.  Write some P2P software that has rules built in that is capable of allocating money to top voted projects.  Use smart contracts to enforce rules.Basically this is a P2P Government, and the possibilities are endless. I nominate no one.  I want an anonymous bitcoin council to be created using multisignature transactions.  It will be sort of like kickstarter, but for the advancement of bitcoin.Basically a site needs to be set up on Tor where people can look at proposals.  Then, people can vote with their money.  If enough money is there for a project idea then the transaction is executed and the funds delivered to the project.  Note that no one needs to be involved with the distribution of money because it's based on multisignature transactions.  That's the whole point of bitcoin. I think having something (a foundation) is better than having nothing at all.  Anyone can join the foundation.  Anyone can create their own foundation.  The problem with people like shadowbitz is that they are complaining because they don't own a successful business and they start whining about it since they are the "little guys."  There will always be big players and little players and alliances will form.  In the case of the Bitcoin Foundation the big players are actually trying to benefit the whole bitcoin community and the whole world and I don't see anything negative about this.With that said, I think bitcoin is bigger than any foundation.  The current Bitcoin Foundation is a corporate non-profit entity derived from the state and backed by legal laws.  Some centralization is required to promote bitcoin and my guess is a "true" bitcoin foundation emerge and will be separate from the state and will be backed by multi-signature transactions and perhaps even use force (like a military).  When this happens the current Bitcoin Foundation will be less important and may even dissolve just like how lovebitcoins.org dissolved.  Alliances are broken and formed all the time but at this point the Bitcoin Foundation is a good thing and I hope it can last a long time and make a difference. lovebitcoins.org just got put out of business It has to be bitcoin!!!  When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Sherlock Holmes This link might be helpful on Sourceforge mirrors:http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Mirrors Gavin would probably say something like, "You want to do it?"   This was discussed a while back.  Bitcoin devs considered hosting downloads on github which uses SSL and is more secure, but is attackable.Maximum security is to use PGP. Using Gavin's PGP signature you can test the SHA256SUMS.asc file to see if the hash in the file is legit.EDIT: See this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=69355.0 Make sure you use pgp to test your download before installing bitcoin.http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2012-5.php What did you do with your TS SCI?  What is SCIF?  Feel free to explain the acronyms.  TS SCI = Top Secret SCI??? Gavin wants to start a P2P gambling site?     I disagree with honestbob.  I thought the article was great! I was just wondering if you guys could register here at bitcoin and introduce yourselves and tell us why you are here.  No need to lurk.  We have a strong feeling you are reading these forums.Moderators, please leave this thread up for a day or two.  I just want to see if this thread gets any bites. btcjam,Who holds the bitcoins when it is in escrow?  Does it use multisignature for transactions?If you hold the bitcoins, show us where you live, where your company is, and what your name is.
A couple guesses:Megaupload gives support to bitcoin financially.Tor more integrated with bitcoin. Give out real names and real addresses please.  We want to meet you in real life. <Jaw drops> According to m-w.com , definition of TANGIBLE:1  a : capable of being perceived especially by the sense of touch : palpable   b : substantially real : material2  : capable of being precisely identified or realized by the mind <her grief was tangible>3  : capable of being appraised at an actual or approximate value <tangible assets>In definition 1a, I don't think the definition of "tangible" applies to bitcoin.  I think bitcoin satisfies 1b, 2 and 3.   To be quite frank, I have a feeling any exchange that Turk sets up will be hacked.  The CEO of a bitcoin exchange has to be not only business savvy, but also techincal.  If the CEO has a hard time now understanding bitcoin there is a chance he will miss something.  I hope I am wrong. This is the most cordial interview ever.  Felix is one smooth talker. Hopefully the announcement won't coincide with the release of Romney's taxes later this month. One time they mentioned the word "mining" in some web description for the GPU.  Other than that, no. Here is a way to test without ultrasound equipment.First dip gold in water to find the amount of displacement.  The displacement will give you a very accurate volume of the bar.  Now using a scale measure the weight of the bar.  Using the volume and the atomic weight of gold you can also calculate weight.  If the calculated weight and measured weight are the same it's a real bar.  If it is lighter then it might have tungsten in it.  Something like that. I dont claim to put in as much effort as DeaDTerra.  Just my advice.  Take it for what its worth.  I have only invest what I am comfortable losing. Hello everyone,I took a glance at DeaDTerra's portfolio.  Having working at a mutual fund company before, I would give DeadDTerra these recommendations.- I agree with DeaDTerra liquidation of GLBSE assets.  Right now I think the fund is invested in too many of them.  Only the top 5 or even 3 GLBSE assets should have any money in them.  DeaDTerra seems like a busy guy so having to research 10+ GLBSE assets a week would be a handful for any one person doing this part time.  I can see DeadTerra researching one asset a day comfortably, but two assets a day five days a week is a bit much.  Knowledge is power.  I suggest cutting back to under 5 or less of the best GLBSE assets that are run by trustworthy people.  I would also sell for a loss any underperfoming, time-consuming assets ASAP.  I know liquidity is bad and it is just a waiting game now.- The recent ASICMINER investment, although risky, was a good speculative play since it is important to invest in the future.  Only a small portion of the fun should be speculative.- Giving out loans at 1.5-3.5% interest a week, in my opinion, is highly risky and people who are asking for such loans risk default and non-payment.  Anyone asking for such a loan may not even be business savvy since USD/fiat loans are much cheaper and it would make more sense to go to a real bank.  In addition banks don't give out commercial loans without substantive credit check, and it is difficult to credit check everyone in the forums.  I would greatly reduce the number of loans given out.- Right now bitcoins are in a bull market.  Merely holding onto bitcoins is an investment itself.  It is better hold onto bitcoins rather than risk losing bitcoins.  If any investment is merely daytrading bitcoins then that would be unprofitable in a bull market.  I would not give out loans to daytraders at this time.- For stable investments look for companies that have already proven themselves, have high integrity, and is transparent.  Gamma Bitcoin Fund is a "stable" fund so most of the portfolio should be in these companies.  Well, the EMP attack could be in Japan and my money over there would be my worry.  (Sounds a bit selfish, but I think it's true.) Seems like people are spreading some FUD on bitcoin and EMP pulses in some comments I read.  How does MtGox or other services defend against this?  Paper wallet?  Faraday Cage?  Can anyone from Mt. Gox comment on this? From some hoarding site:"There appears to be a strong genetic component to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder of the hoarding type. Modeling and conditioning may also play a role in the development of this disorder. OCD usually involves over-activity and/or under-activity of brain regions that underpin the observed behaviors. Hoarding worries and behaviors can begin in childhood, even as young as age five." Maybe "major announcement" will be jgarzik's pybond merging with bitcoin. Awesomeness. Is your company based in China? The BFL singles plug into a computer.  These Avalon devices are stand alone.  A computer is at least 200W probably, right?  My question is how does BFL wattage + computer wattage compare with just the Avalon standalone wattage? Pirate asked the PPT operators for their books so he could pay people directly (I think.)  So the PPT obligations could now be removed, and 100BTC to buy a PPT is now 200BTC (instead of the 300BTC.)  Would this be to pirates advantage? Here is Gavin's description of a serious vs critical vulnerability.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=88892.0
He said he is only doing a partial disclosure and not a full disclosure.  I imagine he will do a full disclosure after the conference and will talk to Gavin.I am guessing he just wants some credit for discovering this vulnerability. http://twitter.com/SDLerner/status/247725013975834624 If you do accounting outside of the blockchain, you can "counterfeit" bitcoins sort of like fractional reserve banking.  But, if you perform a transaction through a bitcoin client and have it record on the blockchain, then is it really possible for pirate to do what you suggested? Have way through the month.  Announcement...plz come soon!!! Sounds like he is upset for a second email "only" 24 hours later.  Seems like a good reason to be upset. Using this calculator, http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/old_calculator.php, at the current difficulty rate it will take on average only 31,145 days to find a block with a CPU which has 4200 kilohashes/second.I don't have the maths for the DSV, but 2^256 is a lot and a computer that tries to find the private key by brute forcing it will take longer than the age of the universe. Side topic:  why is this paper work taking weeks when it should be days? Seems like it is a setup by tseale.  Doesn't seem like they will sign it, just ignore it.Lotta blame to go around.  If you mine with a CPU you will have a practically inifinite better chance of finding bitcoins than with the DSV. The Deep Space Vagabond is worst than any lottery, any gambling casino, any search for alien life, and gives false hope.  Other than that it is fun. :-) 123 Has anyone tried downloading the files?Edit: Ok, I just read more of the thread.  There are so many holes in this story.  For instance, the binary message that was created by sending transactions...anyone can do that, right?  It could be a hoax in a hoax in a hoax...Anyone can create a binary message by sending coins to that address and make anything up. Interesting.  If that is the case then everything including thought, math equations, air guitars is tangible.  It's just that it is worth $0. I can prove I have an air guitar.  I just pretend I have an air guitar, pretend to jam, and voila!  I have an air guitar!  It's easy.  So I don't think the "proof" method works to determine tangibility. I agree that bitcoins are tangible, but why are bitcoins tangible and math equations not tangible? Well, I think it could be possible that tangibility could also depend on scarcity.  Hollywood movies are worth more if the material is new, has a good plot, and that pirated movies are scarce.  If a film is more pirated then Hollywood makes less money.  Hollywood would like to believe that their movies are tangible, but thepiratebay believes information is free and that movies are most likely not tangible.It seems like if something has value then it is tangible.  Value depends on scarcity.  There is an infinite supply of air guitars so these musical instruments have no value and thus are not tangible.  Bitcoins are scarce and have value, and thus, it is one reason they are tangible. So are you going to compete with Mt. Gox or are you working with them.  Seems like after you sold Mt. Gox there would be some sort of non-compete agreement. Sounds like a ripple implementation.  Maybe using Open Transactions.  We need this!EDIT: Maybe you guys are making a new coin, sort of like MintChip which is irreversible and allows exchange of bitcoin for mintchip/CAD and thus fiat. If it doesn't complement bitcoin this thread needs to be moved to Alternative Cryptocurrencies. OpenCoin?  I hope this not a competitor to Bitcoin, but instead a complement to bitcoin. One major difference between electronic files and bitcoins is that electronic files can be copied.  If I make a PDF copy of bitcoin magazine without paying for it then Vladimir would not suffer as much as if I stole all the physical copies of bitcoin magazine from him since he needs to mail those out and they cost money to print.  (Yes you can use a photocopy machine to copy the magazine too but there is cost to do this.  An electronic copy takes no effort and little or no monetary value to copy.)If bitcoins are tangible then tangibility needs to be redefined such that tangible objects cannot be easily copied.  You cannot copy a bitcoin.  A bitcoin is tangible because, in addition to being clear and definite, it cannot be duplicated (easily).
Who knows but this is an incorrect statement:"In June 2011, Mt. Gox, the most popular BitCoin exchange at that time, has been compromised, affecting accounts with equivalent of more than USD 8'750'000. It has resulted in a severe drop in Bitcoin exchange rates."I think Mt. Gox only lost 1000 BTC in the incident due to withdraw limit safeguards. 2^256 = 0.0012 x visible atoms in universeWe're screwed!  http://www.wolframalpha.com/share/clip?f=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427emn0uedi8jd The prices for BTC are waaay low. Ok, sounds good.  Fingers crossed.  What about ASICMINER?  Do you think they are legit and will you continue to invest with them? I have lost 20% since I have invested with the Gamma fund.  Started with 200 BTC now at 160 BTC.  When will the bleeding stop? After reading article I felt like the tide is finally turning.  Bitcoin going mainstream is becoming closer. Whoever got scammed should boycott all of Matt's bitcoin products.  Ellet, Bitcoin Magazine, etc. This was on the front page of Yahoo! Is this a brand new project perhaps?  Based on bitcoin? This is going viral and being retweeted by news networks.  Brace for impact. Someone argued a while back, I forgot who, that Bitcoin natually had to emerge from the Internet.  It was inevitable that Bitcoin had to exist. Seems like there is always excitement with bitcoin.  Something happens all the time.  It's craaaazy!!!  Anyone else with the same feeling? Hmmm...starting to get from virtual to real. Throughout the course of history, humans have always moved to better forms of currency.Beads -> Sea shells -> Wampum -> Metal Coins -> Gold -> Paper money fiat -> Electronic money (paypal, credit cards) -> Return to gold? Bitcoin? This seems like a hoax.  Time to move on. Story gone from drudge for now.  Reaches the tabloidshttp://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2012/09/mitt-romney-tax-returns-allegedly-hacked-up-for-bids/  Welcome Rachel! Will a major company adopt bitcoin?  Google? Maybe not the boldest country but the country with the most inflation. Brian made a bold claim on the Huff Po live show that an African country will adopt bitcoin in 5 to 10 years.  I wonder if there are plans in his company to make this happen.
I prefer ladybytes. Thanks for the link.  This one actually works. Someone almost died because of heat.  Guy feel asleep.  Mining rigs were generating heat on a hot day.  Guy woke up with heat stroke.  Went to hosiptal.  Possible brain damange.  Remember to cool!!! $10 is the new $0.50.  Only way is up. What exactly is going to happen in the next few days that will make more Japanese people get on board? Walls are too easily spotted so a staircase was built but it still acts like a wall.  Good try, manipulator. $1.4 million is required to bring it up to $12. True, we are all trading against each other.  There will be winners and losers in this game and I don't want to be a loser.  If pirate is winning it is plausible that many are losing.  Let's balance the force. Buy low and sell high.  It is as simple as that.  Pirate wants you to buy high and sell low and will take your money and or bitcoins.Have a reserve of USD readily available on Mt. Gox.  When the price drops then buy bitcoins on dips.  When bitpay did this a few weeks ago pirate was not too happy.  Always have USD (or the currency of your choice) available and when the time comes don't panic, think smart, and try to cost average your purchases if you have too.Here is what they said:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=94708.0 pirate has not paid anyone back yet.  Which means he may be planning another big move to drop prices further.  I'm positioned to buy more bitcoins when this happens. I had a feeling you would ask that.  Well, I believe in bitcoins so I'm just doing my part to support the bitcoin economy.  Also, I am betting that bitcoins will increase in value so if I buy early then the fees will be negligible.  If the value of bitcoins go up 1% then I'm covered. Suppose my credit card bill is around $1000 a month.  That means if I get a BitInstant Credit Card I will be buying $1000 worth of bitcoins a month.If 1000 people have the same amount of credit card bills and use the same credit card then that's $100,000 added to the bitcoin economy a month.  That's $1,200,000 a year.  Imagine if 10,000 use the card or 100,000.  That's a lot of money.Could this make the price of bitcoin skyrocket?  Maybe.  Bitinstant will probably convert the bitcoins to dollars when a purchase is made.Most likely, this could further stabilize bitcoin prices but I imagine it may make bitcoin prices go up.  I am thinking about loading up a significant amount of bitcoins in preparation for this card.  But them coins when its cheap. This has been discussed before and many of us believe that is what pirate is doing.  You can defeat pirate by not falling into his trap by panicking. I want cheap coins.  What is fastest way to move USD to Mt Gox?  This might reach bargain levels. I feel like buying!  My logic is this (whether flawed or not.)  pirate was asking for more bitcoins.  pirate would only ask for more bitcoins if he needed more to remain profitable.  If he has USD and bought as the price was going up he would have bought for a loss (since his strategy is to short bitcoins).  He needs to bring the price down so he can buy more bitcoins and return the bitcoins to his investors.  But if his attempt of creating a panic sell fails then he won't be able to buy more coins back without a loss. If pirate did indeed sell, and it rebounds back to 15 he is screwed, big time. The boat has not sailed yet and there is still time to get on.  This boat is like the boat in Lord of the Rings, Return of the King when near the end of the movie it takes a really long time to depart.  All aboard!  Bitcoin to $100.   pirate did not mention at all the rising price of bitcoin which made it difficult for him to get returns.  That is probably the reason why he had to close shop. Maybe they are working with bitcoin card and will release it.
Danger zone was also at 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Hi mom!   100 here we come! In the meantime you can use Armory to separate private and public keys.  Armory allows watch-only wallets where transactions can be logged, but not signed until it is signed on the full-wallet.  This allows, for example, you to hire people to process bitcoin transactions without access to the full wallet.Multisig is waaaaay better though. Satoshi will be revealed in September.Sike. coinbase is working on insuring bitcoin deposits at their site. Mt. Gox,Do you think you can expose an API to allow third parties to determine if a Mt. Gox user is verified? (With the user permission, of course).  Also, it would be great if one could tell where that verified user is from.Why is this needed?  Well, it is illegal for U.S. citizens to gamble.  If an API was exposed to see what country the bitcoins came from then more gambling sites could be created without fear of breaking U.S. laws.Also, a user does not want to verify and re-verify all the time.  It is a time consuming process.  Since Mt. Gox already has this information then it would be easier to verify a user.You could even charge for this service, and I think people would pay. None added. You can vote 4 times.  Go! http://www.bitcoinmoney.com/post/17566027429/bitcoinica-interest-payments You also warned us not to pay too much for bitcoins.  You being a lawyer I can understand why you would say too opposite views in a subtle way such that you cant be wrong.  If I run OT what is the best way to profit from it? BitInstant,Suppose the account owner does not agree.  What will you do in such a case? I like the way you think. I remember when Phinnaeus Gage was investigating who Tom Williams was.  That was a conspiracy theory and because of that I have no reason to give trust in this new conspiracy theory.  Sorry, PG. Web wallets, mt. gox, etc. don't connect to the network.  More people are using those. I would also recommend maybe the Far East Movement to do a hip hop song on bitcoin. Maybe Snoop Lion can do a remix of this song.  That would be awesome.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z9Jwp2x86o Certainly there are East Coast Rappers vs West Coast Rappers culture.  Excellent choice in picking Snoop Lion as he represents the superior artistic group.http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/08/02/snoop-dogg-is-now-snoop-lion-lamest-celebrity-nickname/ Black people have the same subculture?  Again, even though you are black, you are associating skin color with having the same subculture.  But, at least you admit it there was some racism which is a step in the right direction.I am curious, though.  How would you, as a black person, promote bitcoin to black people? OP made a racist post.  It's one thing to say we should promote bitcoin in other countries.  It's another to relate it to skin color.
If what you say is true about the Consultancy, then shame on them.  They are avoiding any responsibility for this mess by doing nothing. I dont know anymore. Shrug. I still dont think he is Atlas.  Not sure why we are banning without proof like an IP address.  If Mike Jones really is who he claims he is (funded interactive tv) he could be an important member. Sorry admin, I thought I posted in the Newbie section. Admin,I do not believe Mike Jones is Atlas.  He is being targeted by various people including Atlas who created a user who resembles Mike Jones in spelling.Plz un-ban Mike Jones.  Thanks.Jimbobway Supposedly, BitSyncom is working on this.  Hopefully, it is not vaporware. Right now there are around 15000 - 17000 complete copies of the blockchain distributed around the world. Good luck in stopping that.http://bitcoinstatus.rowit.co.uk/I encourage bitcoin users to use the Satoshi client or any other client that downloads the full blockchain so it is stored on your comptuer.  EDIT: Looks like we have approx 10000+ copies of the blockchain.  See below. If you are a long term investor (more than a year) and believe in bitcoin then it could be a good buy.If you are a mid term or short term investor then it is really up to you and if you can withstand the volatility. It might be possible pirate made 100% already and he is just paying it out a little at a time at 7% a week.  If he bought at $4.5 and it goes to $9 then that's 100% profit. Ok, so here some points based partially on ArticMine's theory.- It is known that pirate is asking for more bitcoins for his fund.  Normally when things are going good you don't have to ask for more bitcoins.  So I will be assuming pirate did something wrong and needs more bitcoins to be profitable.- ArticMine says pirate is going short.  So if pirate went short recently it means pirate sold some bitcoins and has mostly USD in reserve.  pirate wants the price of bitcoins to drop so he can rebuy more bitcoins (and repay his investors the weekly 7%).- Since the price of bitcoin is stable, and did not drop as pirate expected it put pirate in a very uncomfortable position.  he may have to buy back the bitcoins at a loss resulting in a short squeeze.- sunnakar chimed in and mentioned HNWIs.  If pirate has access to a lot of USD from HNWI then it is possible pirate could be slowly accumulating bitcoins.  If this is the case it is possible that pirate could still continue to be successful if bitcoin prices go up, and he would not be short squeezed. Good point.  Depending on the strength of the cryptographic attack, let's supposed 100 blocks where solved in an hour.  It would raise a lot of suspicion since 100 is a lot.  The bitcoin client would then readjust the difficulty level and all other miners would not solve very many blocks.  Miners would complain and most likey the bitcoin dev team would change the algorithm.But, if 10 blocks were solved in an hour and then the difficulty adjusted it could have been pure luck and there would be no sure fire way to prove it without mathematical proof.I don't think breaking sha256 is "hacking".  It's like a gold miner finding the motherload.  However, I think breaking EC would be hacking. If sha256 is broken then, I think, everyone will keep their coins.  It's just that it is easier to solve blocks so the hackers* get more of the newly mined coins.If elliptical curve cryptography is broken, what a hacker would do, for maximum profit/destruction is to target the wallet address with the most bitcoins and hack that address to determine the private key.  ECC is very, very strong and it is unlikely it will be broken without the use of a quantum computer.* EDIT: Actually they would not be hackers, IMO.  They just found a better way to mine. Here is an example post of sha1 being broken by a chinese university team:http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/cryptanalysis_o.html When sha256 becomes broken, the way it will be detected is that the blocks will be be solved faster than anticipated.  Perhaps someone finds a weakness in sha256 which will make it a little easier to solve blocks.  This happens in cryptography once in a blue moon.  When this happens, the dev team will change the algorithm to something that is unbroken and tell everyone to upgrade.All ASIC miners will become obsolete.  CPU miners will once again be used to solved blocks for maybe a month.  Then GPU and FPGA miners will be reprogrammed to solved the new cyptographic puzzle.Bitcoin will endure until quantum computing becomes a reality but that is so far in the future.  At that time, advances in cryptography will allow the Bitcoin devs to adapt to Shor's algorithm.As a side note, the way I understand it, the private keys are encrypted using elliptical curve cryptography which is different from solving blocks which use sha256. Thanks for pointing back to your posts.  But, can you connect the dots for us and tell us exactly what you think is going on?  I imagine you believe some HNWIs are investing in Bitcoin through a middleman you know.  And you are suggesting that perhaps this will take out pirate? I am accusing the federal gov't of over-taxation and not enough representation!!!This thread is to made random accusations at whoever you could be upset with. Everything you say is true.  The bitcoin currency/protocol is pseudo-anonymous and if done correctly is very difficult if not impossible to trace.Just like how a restaurant accepts cash, you have the option to report how much you made to the gov't.  Similarly, if you accept bitcoin for a business then legally you have to report to the gov't.You are completely in charge of your finances.  If your wallet is stored locally on your computer or smart phone it is yours and no one can take it away from you.  The analogy is like you have gold in your pocket but in digital form.  To take your bitcoin away they have to take your phone or computer away or hack into your system.  (You can encrypt your wallet to make it difficult for hackers to take your bitcoins.)  With other types of bank accounts like PayPal, they can shut you down and take your money away.As with any form of money there needs to be security involved so it is best to learn about how to secure your bitcoins. Not sure if this helps:http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/IndexingXMLData#Patricia_Triehttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/355051/how-do-you-store-a-trie-in-a-relational-database The transaction cost just needs to be increased so it serves as an incentive for miners to support the main block chain...I think. Crazy times.
Technically, they should be able to weigh in on BFL's claims.  But why are they asking the masses through a survey on the validity of BFL's claims?I think LargeCoin already know the truth but they are afraid to believe in it or are in denial mode.  LargeCoin said:So they are guessing BFL is using NRE processes but they seem to refuse to believe it.  So they are creating a survey?  There was a quote that went something like this (copied from Wikipedia), "When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." The fact that LargeCoin is conducting such a survey is troubling to me and doesn't make sense.  From what I know about LargeCoin they don't know what they are doing.  I hope they prove me wrong and maybe they will have an actual product. I believe what BFL says.  See what they said below: Yes, nice post socrates1024.  The core of ripple is to build a network based on trust relationships.  Trust relationships can have different levels between people.  I believe "financial trust" is different from only "trust" in general.  Financial trust is similar to a credit rating.  If I go to Equifax I can get my credit rating which can be as high as 800.  If you get a rating of 750, you can get a car loan, a $400K house loan, a high level of credit, etc.  A credit rating is primarily a score that loan companies in the United States use to determine if a person is creditworthy for loans.  Ripple is different in that financial trust levels are not universal to everyone.  A ripple financial score or credit rating will become greater for people who I know and trust.  I would not give a stranger a high credit rating unless I know him directly or if my friend can vouch for him.Another type of real life rating is "bankruptcy."  If you have ever filed for bankruptcy then you can't get a loan for x years.I think the key to implementing ripple effectively is to import social network data from multiple sources and determine levels of financial trust between friends, family, strangers, and people.  Right not bitcoin-otc, bitcoinary.com, facebook, gmail, google+ could have valuable import data for a ripple implementation.To summarize:1) Build ripple by simulating real life factors such as credit rating and bankruptcy.2.) People in ripple improve their credit score by paying on time and in full.3.) If you supply your identity and location you credit score can greatly improve.  (Not sure how to make this p2p.)4.) If you have a high net-worth you can borrow more money.  That means if you supply a bitcoin address loaded with money on it and can prove you own it then your credit rating will improve. Great checklist!  Old school on paper works too! So you are saying he sold the BTC he was holding for other members and now he has a lot of USD.  pirate wants BTC to drop so he can buy more BTC than he started with.  But, the way to make BTC drop without Bitcoinica is to sell BTC, and since he has little or no BTC he needs more BTC to do so.  That is why he is asking for more BTC from members.And you are suggesting that the way to beat pirate is to sit on our coins and keep the price stable and/or continue to buy BTC so the price goes up?Right?  Interesting theory. Looks like pirate needs more money.  He has lifted the referral requirement so now anyone can invest again in this BCTST.  I am speculating this usually happens when business goes bad so more capital is require to remain "profitable." Ok, I read your paper.  Lot of good ideas.  I'm trying to relate it to real life where my friends borrow money from me or vice versa.  I imagine this could be a facebook app where one can import a social graph and use that as an initial network for an individual user.I am not sure I agree with the rollback concept.  If Bob and Alice do in fact trust each other then they can "rollback the transaction" by performing another transaction.  For example, Bob gives $3 to Alice.  But, there was an communication error somewhere, so instead of rolling back Alice can just give $3 to Bob back since they trust each other.It seems like a rollback is like putting the money into escrow and having it "locked" up until it is committed.I'm just typing out some ideas, not really sure if they are really solid. I am thinking if it goes up, pirate buys driving it up more creating hype.  Hype will cause other people to jump on the bandwagon and buy too.  Then after they buy he sells.  This hype and psychology also works when bitcoin goes down, and then pirate causes panic by selling it down further.. Untainted coins a probably worth a little more.  Virgin coins fresh from mining are worth more. Mike Hearn also made this too.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Ripple_currency_exchange Make it easier so Gavin's grandma can use it. Cool story.  I was just wondering which projects genuinely inspired you.  Thanks. Sure there are sites that use Rails such as Twitter.  The primary reason why I say it's less proven is because I don't see very many financial websites using Rails.Etrade, Ameritrade, Chase, Bank of America, PayPal, etc. don't use Rails.But, I am willing to give Rails the benefit of the doubt and maybe I am wrong this time. I remember when casascius told me when $2.99 was too expensive and told me not to buy. I'll pledge some coins.  Not sure how much. Here are some reasons not to do it in Ruby on Rails:1.) Ruby on Rails is a scripting language built on top of another language.  Any flaws or bugs in the foundation language can propagate to the scripting language.  It takes time to fix these changes until it is fixed and compiled in the Ruby language.  (PHP works the same way where functions in PHP are mostly wrappers to functions in other libraries.)2.) Ruby on Rails hasn't been around as long as some other web languages.  It's less proven.3.) There are less Ruby on Rails developers then other languages.  In the case with Bitcoinica, the code was passed to Intersango who had no experience with Ruby on Rails.4.) Ruby on Rails attempts to write code automatically for you.  It's possible the automatically written code could be overlooked.5.) There specific security issues with RoR.  (I guess you could Google it.) So if I store my bitcoins in my mind as a brainwallet, and whisper it to you then putting me in jail would be a violation of my 1st amendment freedom of speech rights. I don't recommend Ruby on Rails, but perhaps the logic could be recreated in another more reliable language in addition to beefing up the security. Zhou,If your claim system is separate from the Bitconica/Intersango system isn't there a possibility of duplicate payouts from you and also Intersango?  How are you handling this?
This is just a hunch but maybe try posting this plea in he Russian forums. This is very feasible.  Right now I'm invested in the Gamma fund which has about $70K worth of bitcoins.  The Gamma fund operators are loaning out money (with interest).  This is sort of like a bitcoin credit union. He does not need to tell me.  Anyone can do the research to find out how to get bitcoins.  I prefer to buy mining hardware to get bitcoins. People always have a choice to buy bitcoins from bitinstant or somewhere else.  There are many options.  bitinstant is just another way to get bitcoins really quick at a premium.  Some people are willing to pay the 3-4% to get bitcoins really quick.  What's their motto?  "Time is money".In fact, you could even start a bitcoin business selling bitcoins and no one is stopping you. Suggest that OP do some research on older threads before posting.  The same arguments are made over and over.  Nothing new here. OP is asking for donations while saying bitcoin is doomed.  Hypocrite. I think we need a P2P library that encapsulates mining, alt-mining chains, storing of data etc.  It is difficult for most developers to rebuild the core bitcoin logic, and it seems like there is a need to do it over and over.  For example there is now Bitcoin, Namecoin, and Ripple Exchange that require this core logic and it is replicated each time.  If someone could develop a P2P library it could unleash another wave of P2P applications including this ripple exchange. System D not good enough for this list? Hating on banks is too mainstream in the bitcoin comminity so Matt attempts to be hipsterish and go against mainstream. Are you acquiring Bitcoinica?   1.) Did Matt specify a time-frame on when he was going to repay the $3000 loan back?2.) So now that GBF owns 1.25% of Bitcoin Magazine, is this in GLBSE?  Is there a dividend of some sort?  If you wanted to liquidate your shares could you?Thanks. Do you have contingency plans in case something unexpected happens to you?  Thx. As a United States citizen I have no choice but to pay taxes to fund wars to keep our freedom.  Freedom isn't free. What is even more shocking is he is not a plant and actually believes and acts this way in real life.  I think a lot of people here are trying to explain to him how bitcoin works but he has a victim mentality and believes the forum and all of humanity is trying to get him.  In fact, on one of my posts I was actually agreeing with him but he played the victim and argued with me.   If I run the freicoin client once a year will I get my portion of the 4.4%?  I would do that.My first impression of freicoin was 'trick coin'.  The bitcoin elite are hoarders but the want a society with growth.  This is sort of like when the gold standard was lifted and the dollar was free floated. The analogy here is bitcoin is gold and freicoin is USD. That was a huge post by SimonL.  SimonL went out of his way to explain the differences between USD and bitcoin.  If that doesn't budge ridgemont then nothing will.  Although ridgemont did admit bitcoins have black market uses. Ha. This is the internets where authority is not required, my friend.Im not offended. Btw, all I did was confirm everything you said.  I agrees there is greed.  I agree that bitcoin may not be for you. sounds like you should stick with usd.  bitcoin at this point in time is not ready for Gavin's grandma but when it is perhaps you will be ready to use it.welcome to the real world, mi amigo.  yes there is greed all around us. I argue, however, that wallstreet has more greed than bitcoiners. ridgemont, ok, so the USA is responsiblefor USD.  what about gold? who isresponsible for gold? OP, read this.  It will explain why you need to get into bitcoin: Bitcoin  - The Libertarian Introductionhttp://evoorhees.blogspot.com/2012/04/bitcoin-libertarian-introduction.html
OP is a troll.  Ranting on bitcoin in a bitcoin forum to get attention.  When bitcoin becomes $100 a coin I will be laughing. Try posting in this thread in Development and Technical Discussion:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30646.120 RSA Animate - Drive: The surprising truth about what motivates ushttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc&feature=em-share_video_user Some believe this is not true.  I can't say anymore since I'm under NDA. BFL could truly be evil and keep all of their technology for themselves and not sell it to the general public.  Instead, they are "nice" and sell their technology to anyone who wishes to mine.  They could easily, easily, take over the network and hold 99% of the remaining bitcoins to be mined.  Yet, they have decided to sell their equipment to everyone. Even Gavin thinks the BFL coffee warmer is cool:http://twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/214508819483598848 Only until BFL develops quantum miners will I agree to algorithm changes, or if someone breaks the current algorithm.  Reminds me of the time when CPU miners were shut out due to GPU miners.  Yawn. Agree that the title is too sensational. This seems be be a good method which can be done remotely.  You don't even have to open a store front.  Just tell people to send you bitcoins (by email perhaps) and then you write a deposit slip, go to the bank and deposit the local currency into the user's account.  The user will need to have a bank account, of course. Yes I probably could to rich and techinical people.  However, right now there is a need and that is to send money to family overseas.  Western union and moneygram charge 10-20%.  If you send $100 they will take $20.  That $20 could have been a months supply of food for a person in Viet Nam.  So I would think this opportunity is huge because people need to eat. Thx weex.  So let's walk through the steps.1.) A family member in the U.S. sends bitcoins to another family member in Vietnam. 2.) He/she takes their bitcoins to the currency exchange.  It could be a private key string on paper they print out.  It could be in InstantWallet url.  Or they could have a blockchain wallet.3.) Currency exchange accepts bitcoins.  They also have a vault with Vietnamese dollars which they can hand out.4.) Family member in Viet Nam receives Vietnamese dollars and is happy.5.) Currency exchange needs to support itself so they need to somehow convert these bitcoins into Vietnamese dollars to pay rent and buy food.  They could sell them at Mt.Gox or CryptoXChange.  That means they need to have a bank and be able to send funds from MtGox or CryptoXchange to their bank account.  Most likely this would work better with CryptoXchange since they support more currencies. I think the best bet, though, is to find an existing bank/currency exchange in Viet Nam.  We go to them and say, if you use bitcoins you could make 10%-20% more profit.  This needs to be flushed out more but I think the basic idea is there. Suppose I want to open a currency exchange in Viet Nam using bitcoins.  How do I go about doing this?Right now, a lot of USD money is sent to Viet Nam using Western Union or Moneygram.  How could it be done with bitcoins?  Everyone in these forums keep on saying how great an opportunity it will be but I am not sure how to get started.  Seems like you would need to set up a store front in a big city, for instance, the city of Saigon.  That person running that currency exchange would receive bitcoins which is somehow converted into Viet dollars???  Could anyone explain how this could work?  Thanks.If we could create a business plan/formula that could be replicated in different countries and cities then it would be stupendous. I got mine today too.  Yay. anyone in California get their copy yet? Go to 10:26 shhhh!!!  don't let people know how I'm paying for my sports car and mortgage payments. Hmmm....Half the price of Mt. Gox. The critical mistake here is to hand over a Ruby on Rails project to a team unfamiliar with the language.  It's like handing over a Java project to a group of .NET developers.Some may even argue it is a mistake to even code a site like Bitcoinica on RoR. Awesome, awesome, awesome.  Please make it to the final table. bitcoin.org front page next to his name
I did not get a mailed copy yet.  Went to Barnes and Noble.  Not there either.  So sad. Gavin is probably referring to his recent comment on bitcoin mining where bitcoin mining is a zero-sum game.  In an isolated system, however, anything in the closed environment is a zero sum game.  In fact, the entire universe itself is a zero-sum game because of always increasing entropy.Zero sum games can be proven to be true in an isolated system.  However, it is possible that participants, variables, and other factors that interact on top of that isolated system could be greater than zero sum.  I believe that the platform of Bitcoinica could theoretically be proven to be zero sum, but beyond that closed environment is not zero sum and it something much, much greater.I am sad to see Zhoutong leave since an opportunity like Bitcoinica/Bitcoin only comes once in a decade/century/millennium/aeon.  "If you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal and if they can't stop you, you become something else entirely  a legend, Mister Wayne."You could have been Batman. Just adding to the speculation for entertainment purposes.http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/02/world/europe/uk-spy-mystery-death/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 Why not have both?  The easy to read one on top.  Luke's version underneath. I have also used Armory for offline storage and paper backup.  The deterministic wallet concept is amazing and I didn't appreciate it until I created one, destroyed my wallet on purpose leaving no digital copies, and recovered it from my paper backup.  Seems to do the trick.It's almost in beta. Sounds good to me. What do you say at the end?  "All hell, signs and reason"?   Good work Technomage.  I've *never* been able to have a successful submission to Slashdot.  Not sure how you do it but excellent work.

The admins are slow to respond to these things.http://mintchipchallenge.com/forum_topics/925 Ok, here is the evidence which you will need to show Dwolla rise coincides with Bitcoin's rise:http://blog.dwolla.com/infographic-1mm-per-day-in-transactions-and-counting/And the correlation with bitcoin using Google Trends by month:http://www.google.com/trends/?q=bitcoin&ctab=0&geo=all&date=2011&sort=0 Oh yea!  We need 30 iphone cameras so we can do a 360 degree Matrix style rotation face reaction from Ben Milne.Seriously, Dwolla's success is based on bitcoin and this has been hidden from investors including the latest round and Ashton. I am looking forward to your views on bitcoin (including if bitcoin is a commodity or not.)  I hope you guys can win some legal battles for us. Here's what I did:C:\>gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.ascgpg: Signature made 03/16/12 13:01:01 Pacific Daylight Time using RSA key ID 1FC730C1gpg: Good signature from "Gavin Andresen (CODE SIGNING KEY) <gavinandresen@gmail.com>"gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.Primary key fingerprint: 2664 6D99 CBAE C9B8 1982  EF60 29D9 EE6B 1FC7 30C1Should I be worried about the warnings?  BTW, I did a sha256sum and it matches the one in the SHA256SUMS.asc file.  It is just the warning above that bugs me.  I also imported gavin's PGP and it imported ok.

MintChip is DOA: Dead on Arrival Should I be receiving a copy soon in the mail?  Why is everyone getting a copy but me? So you can buy drugs with MintChip and send MintChips across borders.  If the gov't of Canada can do this then U.S. politicians must give into bitcoin.  I see this as a bitcoin win.
This is a great idea...who wants to do it? There is also a central authority which is the Royal Canadian Mint.  Kudos to them for taking this effort unlike other mints around the world.  But at this point I am skeptical. So how long before this is hacked?  Place your bets! Catalysts, in the financial world, are basically triggers that cause the price to go up (or down).  Some previous catalysts included bloggers spreading the word.  Mainstream media picking up on the news.  Exchanges such as Mt. Gox being opened.  What are some potential catalysts for bitcoin to explode?Here are my picks:1.) Diablo III and Virtual Goods.  Combine Diablo with ogrr.com and you've got more than a million dollar market for virtual goods.2.) GGB (Girls Gone Bitcoin) or something related.  They've made $700+ in a day.  Could be a start of a bandwagon.3.) Gold/economy collapsing http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/raid-of-medical-pot-school-theyre-going-after-industry-leaders.htmlEdit:It is legal in California and the citizens of California voted to legalize medial marijuana.  However, federal law trumps state law so the feds seems to have raided these state legitimized businesses.  This could be huge. Please be very careful with fraud.  There is a reason why most ways to buy bitcoins don't involve credit cards.  But, maybe you've figured it out.  Good luck and be safe. bitcoin gave dwolla the surge for additional vc investment. Ben is basically snubbing the bitcoin community. This is great!  We want transparency and fairness.  And hot girls.I say he will say bitcoin twice in his speech not counting the Q&A.

I want to get the balance of a bitcoin address but the description of the web call on blockexplorer says this:Why does it say that it is a bad idea? Ok, I understand.  Although, I thought Chocolate Rain was a success.  Dr. Pepper used the singer of Chocolate Rain in their commercials.Anyways, I am think I am fully exhausted on this topic.  I admit my perception of things have sharpened a bit. What do u mean by this? Fair enough.  But suppose she was willing to do it for herself to make money or get more attention?  So, I'm not going to force her to do anything.  I'm just going to ask her.  It will be on her own freewill if she decides to do it or not. Ok, good point.  So I'll add another criteria.  Popular and not-evil.
So you are saying they are freaks?  You are degrading them and us all. Not necessarily.  Some people are famous for being famous.  For instace, Paris Hilton and her notability is highly arguable.  I argue that there is no difference on using Paris Hilton or NaNa to promote something simply because they are famous. Everyone please be nice to NaNa.  I got her to come to this forum and read your posts.  She is not happy with some things she read.  NaNa is a human being like the rest of us. I requested her to cover a song.  Not that one but another song.  I don't want to ruin it so it's a secret now. Will do!  I come up with something for her and sent it.  Now I guess we'll just wait and hope she pulls throught. She has to say something about bitcoin to get my money's worth.  Anybody? ok she will do it!  I need a script!  help!  she will read whatever we give her! most creative one wins.  or we can do it collectively. ready set go!!! Ok, NaNa replied back to me!  So far it's $150 from me and $100 from Johnathan.  Thx Johnathan!I told her to do two videos.  For first video I will pay her $100.   If we like it then for the second $150.For each video we'll pay 50% before and 50% after.I told her we'll pay her in PayPal :-( or bitcoins.  Hopefully she will take bitcoins.  We'll see what she says.  I'm already thinking of a script:"Hi, I'm NaNa, the bitcoin girl!  I love you satoshi nakamoto!" http://youtu.be/Qnkwrq39HXw?t=18s You realize you just made fun of overweight people, used the "r" word (liber*****), and put down libertarians in one sentence?  So you approve of using homeless people to promote technology but not overweight people?  Not trying to break you, just keeping my mind busy using the Internets. I don't care if NaNa can sing or not.  I care that she is popular and she can promote bitcoin.  I sent her a message so let's see if I get a response. Now, William Hung can't sing either, but look what he did with what he had.  He had a good attitude, most people loved him, and he got to be in the spotlight for a shortwhile.  He was happy and he made others happy. has anyone tried contacting her to put a bitcoin sticker on her forehead? Can you finish your sentence? If it was easy everyone would be doing it.  I want to become a gold miner but I don't have the machinery to buy bulldozers.  If you don't want to mine you can invest in mining contracts.  Or have miners mine the bitcoins for you. The author doesn't mention bitcoin but everything he says is implcitly screaming bitcoin (or not).  He talks about currency and how it is controlled by gov't and corporations.  Since Satoshi embedded that headline in the genesis block I have to post this here.http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/08/opinion/rushkoff-one-percent/index.html?hpt=hp_c2 Good idea.  I may post a bounty once I figure out what I need.  If I go with the GAE method then it will need to run on GAE.  Again I just need to read out of the blockchain.  Also, some the bitcond commands also need to work so you can query the blockchain from GAE, for instance, getting the balance of a bitcoin address.Seems like if bitcoin can run on GAE it can scale indefinitely. Wait, I can access it...testing: https://www.dwolla.com/tosUPDATE: Something seems to be wrong with the link I posted.  The above link works. I can no longer access the Dwolla TOS:https://www.dwolla.com/​tos Thanks Mike.  I'll be looking into this although I don't know if I have the time (or maybe even the talent).
So I used this one line twice today not because I was planning on it but it just came out of my mouth.  It was VERY effective.  I had a whole conversation about 5 min with one person.  For the second person they asked for more information and I gave them three websites which I wrote down on a receipt for him.  The second person was a cashier and he saw my "bitbill".  I started explaining to him and what hooked him in was this line:"Bitcoin is going to end all wars."Yep, I know it's a shocker line but I believe in it and it just makes people curious about what it was.  Once he was hooked the final push was me mentioning how "bitcoin is controlled by the power of mathematics."Use my one liners! Worked for me!   May not be against the law but can be used against you in the court of law. Seems like the old timers at the bitcoin forums can remember this clearly.  But, let's review the facts.  For me, this is one of the the smoking guns:Using wayback machine no wording of "chargeback":http://web.archive.org/web/20100730001213/http://www.dwolla.org/help/terms-of-use/After the TH fiasco they added chargeback wording:https://www.dwolla.com/tos  (Current tos)And Ben Milne's lies:"Most all merchants are well aware of the problem, which is why weve always had something in our terms of service about chargebacks since Day One. " - Ben MilneNote Ben's uppercase use of "Day One".  Ben is a liar.  As a midwesterner, I am ashamed Ben is from Iowa. From all of my experiences with Dwolla it seems like they act like a corporation, have no sense of humility, and resembles PayPal.Many of us have been through the TradeHill fiasco last year.  From what I know about TradeHill they seem to have a lot of integrity since I've seen them in videos, in the forum posts, and in emails.It is ridiculous that anyone would think they engineered their own downfall last year, waited for the $5 million investment in Dwolla, so they could sue them for $2 million.  This is defintely not a case of "sour grapes" as Dwolla's angel investor has said.TradeHill posted some of their data on Dwolla, if I remember correctly.  Dwolla however has not said very much. More Dwolla arrogance:http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2012/03/06/bitcoin-exchanges-files-lawsuit-against-dwolla/ The base unit of Bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC) is sometimes called a Satoshi, after Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Vocabulary You can voice your opinions at Dwolla's Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/#!/dwolla Now I got this email saying I need to pay (but I already paid.):A payment window has opened for a project you have reserved shares in: Screw Banks, Use Bitcoins [THIS PROJECT ONLY TAKES BITCOINS TO PAY FOR SHARES] You must log in to PirateMyFilm and pay for these shares before 2012-03-08, or they will be made available to others in the queue. You can pay for your shares by logging in and going to the project page You will see a "Buy Now" paypal button, which will allow you to do so. It's 'jimbobway', same as here.  Thanks. When Diablo III comes out this year it is going to be HUGE. I go to the project page and it doesn't look like it says I paid, although I did pay. I paid to this address 19WNo23dAsCzSQJkdMNM3piJBQ1bxqzYAcI went here, http://www.piratemyfilm.com/projects/304And it says:Payment InfoThis project is currently in the payment stage.

What is the feasibility on putting block chain on Google App Engine?  I would like to do this since my app relies on Google App Engine.  I just want to read out of the block chain. zhoutong, thx for being part of the bitcoin community and being a class act.  I hope Linode provides you with all of the compensation. Seems likely an attacker would have or has had a linode account as well...     Bitcoinica seems to be back up. hxtop,I don't know if you are aware of this but we have Chinese translations of Satoshi's paper in Chinese and Chinese Traditional format.Chinese https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B1UsG65HCLkuOGNkMDZmMzYtZTQ0OC00OGVmLTk2MGItODBkNjA0MDEwYjkw&hl=enChinese Traditionalhttps://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B1UsG65HCLkuMTc5NjFjMzUtZjQxMy00ZTAzLWJkNjYtMmZhNTcyMzhmY2M1&hl=en_USOr, you can access them at bitcoinblogger.com. Agreed that this is an excellent review.  Donate to the Armory project and check it out! Here is the completed Hebrew version:https://bitcoil.co.il/bitcoin-hebrew.pdf
Thanks to Meni Rosenfeld of bitcoil.co.il we now have a Hebrew translated version of the original Satoshi paper!!!  Check it out...it reads from right to left!  You can access the paper using this link:https://bitcoil.co.il/bitcoin-hebrew.pdfMeni translated the document and put it in Word format.  I took the Word format and converted it pdf, added the charts, pics, and formatted it.  If you would like to translate the bitcoin paper for another language let me know and we can work together.  You can also access the Hebrew translation at http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/Thanks!   I was there with goodlord666.  He and I was collecting shells and was trading them for beers on the beach.  After Satoshi said, "BRB", he muttered under his breath how we were idiots for trading shells for beers.  We all looked at each other but little did Satoshi know there were girls on the beach asking us where we found our unique shells.  So later that night we were hanging out with some hot beach girls.  Satoshi however, pulled out his iPad and started using his finger to write a ton of code.  Just one finger moving intensely and tapping on the screen.  I never seen anything like it. I will be donating. Out of town now but will come up with a figure soon. It seems like the U.S. is putting itself in a position to lose in the P2P banking revolution with all its regulations.  If it weren't for regulations there would be so many U.S. bitcoin exchanges now.  People are afraid to get in trouble with state and gov't laws.Because of U.S. regulation people and companies in other countries are dominating the bitcoin businesses including, Mt. Gox and Bitcoinica.  Less regulation means more opportunity.Which country has the least regulations to allow bitcoins to thrive? I was hoping for 25 people but would settle for getting at least 10 people on board for this to make an impact.  Thx sunnakar, I'll check out Cafe Libertalia. Cool.  I am thinking, though, a good restaurant location should be in a central location.  Maybe Hillcrest is a good location.There is a Vietnamese restaurant in Hillcrest that is good.I'm getting hungry now. :-) Inspired by Phinnaeus Gage Chicago thread and adamstgBit Montreal thread, I want to form a list of San Diego bitcoin users who would like to go to restaurants accepting bitcoins as much as possible.  Once we have this list, I will start emailing and calling restaurant managers.  I am also thinking if I have your email and or signature it will be more convincing...sort of like a petition.  If a restaurant manager sees this list then it will be a no brainer to use bitcoin if the list is long enough.  Add your name to this thread if you live in San Diego and also your restaurant choice.  My choice is Stacked in Fashion Valley Mall since you can already order food via an iPad.jimbobwayCornedBeefHashgeek-tradersunnankargnar1ta$supertubesTrader StevedissipateAfricanHunter Interesting.  What is your reasoning on why BTC and S&P are very closely related? evoorhees, thanks for being part of the bitcoin community.  We need more guys like yourself.  Great work! You don't mind revealing the name of the payment processor that took $100K form you?  I know that Dwolla took $10K from you guys before. Ok, seems like it will take some time and maybe some marketing to get your site to have more users.  (It took bit-pay a while and they are still working on it.)Don't give up if you don't get a lot of users initially.  I think if you can make it run itself you don't have to put much time into maintaining it. Does or will btcbuckets use multitransactions? I read the paper and I believe George Selgin is incorrect in his analysis.  He invents a new term called "quasi-commodities" and claims that bitcoin is a quasi-commodity.  According to him quasi-commodities have no non-monetary uses, and his entire argument for his paper is based on this fact.  Bitcoin is a commodity, not a quasi-commodity.Bitcoin in its current state has time-stamping capabilities, which allows documents to be time-stamped.  This allows voting systems to be developed with bitcoin as shown by researchers.  http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328476.500-bitcoin-online-currency-gets-new-job-in-web-security.html.  Software developers are just beginning to discover how to utilize this property.In addition, Bitcoin is on the cusp of allowing multisignature transactions.  This will unleash the full potential of bitcoin which will allow contract systems never before seen.  See here for some contract possibilities: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/ContractsMr. Selgin also failed to mention Namecoin, which does have a non-monetary use in registering domain names.Bitcoin has properties other than monetary value, and thus it is a commodity, not a quasi-commodity. If we can convince Blizzard to offer bitcoins for Battle.net balance then, then...[fill in the blank]. Nice.  Well, whoever builds a supercomputer that uses Radeon's instead of Teslas will probably see a surge of new users.  120MH/s is not much for 2 highly expensive Teslas.  I am pulling 380Mh/s with my Radeon 6000 series on my home computer. In theory, a small scale account ledger can be created between 3 people which could be memorized.  There could only be three "thought coins" and the 3 people in the system could memorize who owns which coins.Bitcoin just scales this thought experiment up massively, but it it just requires computers to memorize who owns how many bitcoins.Edit: How would one argue the bitcoin account ledger is different from a bank account ledger?  Is the bank account ledger also speech?  I am thinking probably not. To be honest I did not think her presentation was FUD until I read Irdial's response.  In particular this paragraph stood out for me:If more people in legislation thinks like Flicks, then it is likely that bitcoins will be more and more regulated.  Libertarians seem to be able to spot these types of statist ideas like an eagle's eye. Right on! This elliott wave article suggests a high of 1511.  What...to...do...[Edit] Not sure where the high of 1511 falls on the count though.  http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2012/02/06/sp-500-still-riding-strongest-bull-wave-technically-speaking/ Ok, sorry if I sounded like I attacked S3052.  I didn't find them on the main page (they used to be on the main page...I think.)
S3052, did you remove your postings on the stock market apocalypse?  Where are they?  You did an analysis on the S&P 500 and predicted it would go down...a lot.  Are you too embarrassed to leave them up?  I bet if they came true you would be boasting about it instead of hiding them.  Please correct me if I am wrong. Catherine Flick seems like a nice lady.  I think people are just fine tuning bitcoin and why it should exist and debating it with Catherine's arguments.  In addition, libertarians are also very passionate about individual freedoms. I left this on the bitcoinmedia site:Surveys like the one Catherine created can influence the psychology of peoples minds. What if I substituted Bitcoin with another phrase?1.) Do you think it is good or bad for Catherine Flick to donate to hate or terrorist groups?2.) Do you think it is good or bad for Catherine Flick to donate to legal political or other organizations?3.) Things that Catherine Flick can do for good?4.) Things that Catherine Flick can do for bad?Asking questions like this can unfortunately associate Bitcoin with bad subjects, just like how Catherine Flick can be associated with these negative subjects. I think I read somewhere on this forum that bitcoin is an intrinsic property of the Internet.  As an analogy, Bitcoin is an elemental property of the Internet that was born similarly when elements where born out of the Big Bang.  It had to come into existence.  Sounds like sci-fi, but for real. I read your blog post and it seems what you have argued makes sense.  It seems like by the letter of the law (U.S. law) bitcoin is not a currency.  You also argued that bitcoin is not an investment contract.To me it seems like if bitcoin is not a currency, and if it's not security (investment contract), then is bitcoin then a commodity?  Seems like you didn't mention anything about commodities, probably for some unmentioned reason.  In The Good Wife the lawyers also argued that bitcoin was a commodity.I think bitcoin is like gold.  There is no "issuer".  Work needs to be done to "mine" for bitcoins.  Work needs to be done to "mine" for gold.  There is a limited supply of bitcoins and gold.The value of gold goes up and down.  The value of bitcoins go up and down.  Some people choose to use gold, bitcoins, or both as an investment.Surely, gold is not a security, nor is it a currency that is issued by a country.  Since bitcoin is so much like gold I have to conclude that bitcoin is a commodity. Can't wait!  Can you give us a hint? Congrats on your activation!I have a question that is somewhat related and can move this to another topic if it bothers you.  How did you handle instant payment confirmation without waiting for 6 confirmations?  Could someone cheat the system by these instant confirmations? Lol.  Pretty much anything can be far from impossible.I can levitate if all the air molecules around me randomly decide to lift me up which is far from impossible.1 or 1 gaziillion is so far away from infinity. It is hard to access silk road.  Would it be legal to have a website that caches silk road daily but u cannot buy anything from it?  It is just for curious people or for journalistic research. Perhaps in open source development relationships aren't always cordial.  (That was why in the video Gavin posted the leads of Subversion were venting.)  I do know that most successful for-profit software development shops where one needs to be physically at work tends, for the most part, to be cordial in environment.  Most people don't want to go to work in a hostile environment and people who don't fit in will quit or get fired.If I were lead I would want to produce an open source environment that is as cordial as possible, even though that may never happen. The concept of "team" is very important in all organizations and maybe even more so in open source projects.  Team interaction and communication is key.  If a person cannot communicate, lay down his ego, or continually brings up old issues then the whole team breaks down resulting in software paralysis. Gavin seems to be a very reasonable guy on paper and in person in videos.  Gavin is also very transparent.  Satoshi, himself, annointed Gavin to lead the bitcoin project.  Gavin's voice clearly deserves to be weighted more than others.  I believe in Gavin.I'd like to see a video of Luke to see how really socially normal he is.  It is easy to hide behind a keyboard, write BIPs and code.  But to take responsibility and ownership of a project and to put your face and reputation on it is another story. bitsyncom is developing a an Internet cell tower that is completely, I think, separate from the Regular Internet.  Users use it by paying for it with bitcoins.  The more bandwidth u use the more u pay.  since bitcoins can handle micro transactions it is perfect. I have been involved with a lot of clubs.  We try to raise money in different ways.  Car wash, door-to-door selling stuff, donations, etc.  However, there is one really effective way to raise money that is easy and effective.  The successful clubs I join run a raffle at each meeting and people can buy raffle tickets.  The prizes are donated or bought.  The revenue generated from the tickets funds the club.So, if there was someway for you to run a raffle for prizes maybe you can use the money to fund the magazine, which will be for a good cause for bitcoiners. I am American and I prefer "Armory".  Didn't realize there was another spelling, "Armoury".  Only English, non-US really care about this.  Asian, non-latin languages don't really care about the spelling.  I think it is better to be consistent and just keep "Armory".   Thumbs up! I am hoping Fred will ask Dwolla to integrate bitcoin into their services. Someone could program an agent that would try to make money, and profits could be split to the "father" of the agent. Intersango, Patrick, and Amir have a history of beef with Bitcoinica, even publicly saying "Bitcoinica is a way to separate fools from their money."  So, in my opinion there is indeed some negativity until there is some apology or proof. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_7:_Rapidly_adjusted_.28micro.29payments_to_a_pre-determined_partyExample 7: Rapidly adjusted (micro)payments to a pre-determined partyBitcoin transactions are very cheap relative to traditional payment systems, but still have a cost due to the need for it to be mined upon and stored. There are some cases in which you want to rapidly and cheaply adjust the amount of money sent to a particular recipient without incurring the cost of a broadcast transaction.For example, consider an untrusted internet access point, like a WiFi hotspot in a cafe you never visited before. You'd like to pay per 10 kilobytes of usage for 0.001 BTC each, without opening an account with the cafe. A zero-trust solution means it could be fully automatic, so you could just pre-allocate a budget on your phones mobile wallet at the start of the month, and then your device automatically negotiates and pays for internet access on demand. The cafe also wants to allow anyone to pay them without the fear of being ripped off.To do this, a protocol similar to one proposed by hashcoin can be used:    Request a public key from the access point.    Create but do not sign a transaction (T1) which sets up a payment of (for example) 10 BTC to an output requiring both the access points public key and one of your own to be used. The value to be used is chosen as an efficiency tradeoff.    Create but do not sign another transaction (T2) which has two outputs, one to the access points key and another which goes back to you. The initial value is 0.001 BTC to the access point and the rest back to you. Use a sequence number of zero on the input and a lock time of some point in the future (eg, 1 day).    Send both unsigned transactions to the access point. It sees that T1 and T2 are of the expected form and signs T2. It hands T2 back to you.    Check T2 is signed correctly, sign T1 and T2. Send them to the access point which broadcasts them, thus locking in the agreement. Note that T2 won't get included into a block for at least one day, unless it's replaced by a newer transaction, as determined by the sequence numbers.    Each time you want 10kb of data quota, sign a new version of T2 with a higher sequence number, the same lock time and adjust the outputs so more value is allocated to the access point and send it. The AP sees that the output sizes are correct, signs it and keeps it (does not broadcast). This continues until the session ends or the 1 day period is getting close to expiry. The AP broadcasts the last transaction it saw, replacing the original that was pending. Once the lock time passes, the value transfer is committed. Alternatively if the session end is negotiated cleanly, the user can sign a transaction that's final (sequence number of UINT_MAX) which signals that no more data quota will be purchased, allowing instant commitment of the transaction.The lock time and sequence numbers avoid an attack in which the AP provides connectivity, and then the user double spends the output back to themselves using the first version of TX2 thus preventing the cafe from claiming the bill. If the user does try this, the TX won't be included right away giving the access point a window of time in which it can observe the TX broadcast, and broadcast the last version it saw, overriding the users attempted double spend. 
A killer bitcoin app will eventually emerge that will propel bitcoin into the massive mainstream.  The creation of "Netscape" was the eureka moment that had tons of developers evolved BBS to HTML and web browsing.I am working on one myself...stay tuned! The value of bitcoin is highly speculative and good points have been made.  However, I also want to point out that the number of total bitcoins ever to come into existence still has not changed (approx 21 million).  The number of coins mined will be halved by the end of the year.  Only 347 days left.There are a ton of short term speculators here.  Some people are here for the long term so if you truly believe bitcoin will be adopted then any buy in the beginnings of bitcoin is a good buy. You should consider implementing an engine that interfaces with Mt. Gox, Tradehill, CryptoExchange and any other exchange.  You should also implement your own service.  Then you would code your algorithms that will pick the lowest cost trade to execute.  It would be easy for you to pick one exchange and implement that but the ultimate platform would be to interface with as many exchanges as possible, including one that you run.Each exchange probably has their quirks so the difficulty would be making sure you take care of these quirks. Now might be a good time to buy more bitcoins.   Transferring money... Seems to me Armory could supplant the orginal bitcoin client.  I like how you run tests in addition to providing all of these features.  I don't know how to compile but I will test this. Concerning the offline transactions feature...Would a feature like this be used for a large company like Best Buy?  Best Buy would create multiple wallets on each cash register that would be offline.  At the end of the day the wallets are collected, imported on an online computer, and then broadcasted. Owning bitcoins is owning a string of letters and numbers that only you know about.  It's like a password (private key) that when used is worth money.

Bitcoin and its users would make a great reality show. Thanks for your efforts. Can't wait!   If someone started a blog dedicated to ripping into the media's ignorance on bitcoin I would read it everyday.  Maybe I should start ripping into this poorly written article on my own blog.Anyways, in keeping up with the spirit of this thread here is another link:http://www.arbitragemagazine.com/topics/finance/bitcoins-decentralized-digital-currency/ Zhou'tong' song?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oai1V7kaFBk&feature=youtu.be&t=1m31s I'm starting to like .5.  Does the job. Nice.  +1 Can you add some more details and any information on your donation page with the bitcoin button?  I'd like to link to it but there is no info on the page, really.  Maybe put in a few small words about bitcoin, what it is, and why you are accepting it. anyone with any news?  it's past the time...

France is screwing themselves over through this regulation.  Any country that regulates bitcoin will be left behind.  Dont fight the inevitable. If you cant beat bitcoin, join bitcoin. I just bought some more bitcoins.  Time to buy stuff fo r xmas.  Gotta get that bitcoin tshirt.  Remember, you can also try to spend your invested bitcoins and support the bitcoin economy.  Need hosting? Find a bitcoin hosting provider.  Buy a bitcoin tshirt or two.   etc... Computer bacteria...I like the terminology! ...or a software agent could provide hosting services and scrape private keys from humans.  This autonomous bot could start day trading and make big bucks. Initial goal should be to make as much money (bitcoins) as possible.  Very interesting idea though. Umm, this might be big news."In response to coordinated attacks on the occupations and attacks on workers across the world:Occupy Denver stands in solidary with our brothers and sisters who will be blocking the economic apparatus of the 1% by shutting down the ports of the world on Dec 12.

Will both Allison and Ashley be in this video? I would have to agree with slush on this one.  This open source project is pretty organized compared to the many other thousands of open source projects out there.  Organization and structure is slowing coming into fruition with BIPs, leadership (Gavin), release candidates, GIT, etc.  I would say the organization is comparable to Linux and BitTorrent development.As for marketing bitcoin has a lot of publicity both good and bad but it has been in the lime light more than most open source projects.  It's been featured on Slashdot numerous times.  If you compare bitcoin and PayPal it is night and day in terms of marketing, so yes I agree with S3052 on this.  I think most everyone wants to help out with their own ideas, but there is not really one central big marketing push.  For example, what if we all chipped in for one super bowl ad?In the end market forces will determine if bitcoin will succeed and not advertising.  Bitcoin, in my opinion, has so many unique properties for it not to succeed.  If it really is cheaper and faster to make transactions, if it's possible to make transactions "anonymous", if it's better than other alternatives then it will grow.  I think for me it is a question of how fast it can grow.I've pretty much devoted most of my time to marketing bitcoin with my blog and not trying to make money on it.  Sometimes I wonder if I should start being selfish (no offense) and start building a site or trading bitcoins on the side. Ok, I may have answer my own question.  I found this:http://blockexplorer.com/q I want to develop a bitcoin app on Google App Engine (GAE).  However, I don't know if I can actually run bitcoin on GAE.  What I need is to be able to get total balance given a bitcoin address.  What is the easiest way to do this?  Thanks.

Question...I understand that Gavin and Satoshi have a super duper password to notify all clients to display a message.  Was this tested or included in the bitcoin-qt? Yes indeed there is interest.   I get this a lot but it is my personal belief that more people would less likely think it is a scam if they understood the basics of how it worked.  Right now if you didn't know English it takes a bit of faith to believe in bitcoin.

A 0.5 release with GUI changes should be huge news.  I will be sure to blog about this.  We (or you and developers) are half way to 1.0!  Can't wait. Gavin is Notradamus:I am working on a killer application...hopefully I can finish it soon. Only people who are actually living in North Carolina should really answer the question. I'm playing the good guy here and I want to point out that there are some good people here that are involved in bitcoin who are not thieves, crooks, liars, or criminals.  It's too bad some/(many) people have to ruin it for everyone else. That was pretty brutal to watch. My response to this:  http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/10/bitcoin-popular-target-for-fud-fear.html theymos has some good points here.  There has been already one "attempt" at a Bitcoin Foundation and it is called the "Bitcoin Consultancy" headed by genjix.  In fact, what theymos says is completely true and genjix is, in fact, trying to create his own bitcoin library.  If there were a foundation there would have to be rules so one group does not have an advantage over the other. Maybe create another column of type text that is the text version of the bytea 'script' data.  Then you can use LIKE since each data type is of type  text.You could use a stored procedure to do the conversion but I think it will take too long. Maybe a part of the Bitcoin Foundation should somewhat resemble the EFF.  (Electronic Frontier Foundation.)  We need some lawyers willing to protect bitcoin in every country. I've heard that the state of Utah and the Mormon church was interested in bitcoins.  The state of Utah just passed some legislation to allow gold and silver to be treated as legal currencies.  If the Mormon church realizes the power of bitcoins, maybe the Vatican will too. Gavin has plans to implement multiple private keys transactions before version 1.0.  There will be multiple transaction types, not just A and B signing.Once these new transactions are available new services such as escrow will be available in the bitcoin API.  Bitcoin's features will rock finance, escrow, banking, contracts, etc.Initial support for multisignature transactionsThis adds initial support for three new types of transactions:(a and b)(a or b)(a and b) or cHere is the design discussion: https://gist.github.com/39158239e36f6af69d6f How can we let the Vatican know about bitcoin?http://www.drudgereport.com/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/24/idUS264245887020111024 He is not the father, but he brought back the Elliott Wave.   There is a professor that went to a Senate hearing in front of Ron Paul that wanted the U.S. to allow competing currencies including bitcoin.  He seems to be a good candidate for a speaker. I'm looking for a Chinese speaker who lives in San Diego.  I need this person to be able to translate the website.  This person has to be interested in bitcoins and will work for equity.   Can we relabel the front page of bitcoin to say crypto-commodity instead of crypto-currency?  After much thinking I believe that it is a commodity.  Also lawyers in France are using the bitcoin.org homepage against us.Can we please relabel it for the sake of bitcoin and because it really is a commodity?Thank you. My response to Mr. Dvorak, http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/10/why-it-is-impossible-for-bitcoin-to.html Idea: Get alibaba.com to accept bitcoins.  Easy money.  Or someone else build an bitcoin version of alibaba. I paid someone 20 BTC in China ($100 at the time) to help me translate some bitcoin material.  It was so easy.  I would not have been able to do this with PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, or even cash. do u have one in pdf format?
Nice.  Will users be able to verify that their call is encrypted, or do we have to trust your website? what kind of software are you using to run the tournament?  i am thinking about programming a web based tournament site. Bitcoin is P2P.  It can't die.  It can drop in value, but unlike a company or central authority it can't go away.  I don't think they understand this. bitcoin can be hard to explain to non-techies...keep on trying. I'm thinking about heading out this Saturday morning and spending the entire day at Occupy San Diego.  They are camping out indefinitely at the Civic Center.  Anyone interested?  I will make a sign.  What should the sign say?  The sign should mention bitcoin somewhere. Specifically mention #operationbitcoin at #operationwallstreet. What question should I ask if I get in? I made a flyer u can print out.  U can download it at bitcoinblogger.com I don't agree with Michael Moore all the time but go find him and convince him to use bitcoins.  Use his celebrity power so people will listen. Go to bitcoin.org!!!  Bitcoin is the answer to all your problems and our children's problems!!!  Bitcoin is decentralized and there is no bank to ruin your lives!!!  Bitcoin is the key to a non-wallstreet dominated culture!!! Thanks for the tip.  I prob won't mention the Wallstreet protests next time I do it. I got a restaurant "Stacked" interested in bitcoins.  Read from bottom to top:I am very eager to explain how bitcoin works.  Right now there are about 20+ bitcoin exchanges that convert USD to BTC and BTC to USD.  Last year there were no exchanges but bitcoin has been growing really fast.Bitcoin derives its value from supply and demand.  There are people on exchanges that are willing to pay for bitcoins.  For example, if you go to bitcoinwatch.com you can see the current value of bitcoin which is around $4.50 a coin.  This value fluctuates since bitcoin is so new, but in the long run (maybe many years) it may become a stable currency.Why do people want bitcoins?  Bitcoin has certain properties that people desire.  First, there will only be 21 million bitcoins in existence so in essence there is a limited supply.  Bitcoin also has little or no transaction fee compared to credit cards (where they charge the merchant a percentage fee.)  Another property of bitcoin is that it is global and you can send it to China in a hour or less.  Other methods of international payment may take days or weeks and there is an international fee.  Bitcoin, I believe, is sort of like digital gold.I can understand why you need USD to pay your staff.  I think bit-pay.com allows you to convert any BTC daily into USD.  Again, I am not affiliated with them and I am just excited about bitcoins and it's ability to end Wallstreet dominance since it does not require a central authority to perform a transaction (no PayPal, Citibank, etc.)JimOn Fri, Oct 7, 2011 at 9:22 AM, brian  wrote:Thanks Jim, although I looked at the site, I have to admit, I don't understand how a bitcoin derives value. Does it have a tie to the US monetary system?  If I can't pay my suppliers and staff with it, how can I accept it for payment?Interested in continuing this dialogue.On Fri, Oct 7, 2011 at 9:15 AM, Jim wrote:Thanks for your response.  Just an idea, but your business could gain some media attention if you used bitcoins.  There is a restaurant in New York called Meze Grill that accepts bitcoins and they were featured on CNN.  Also, there could be a niche market of people that would go to your restaurant to specifically spend bitcoins.  Please see this mobile checkout program:  https://bit-pay.com/aboutMobile.html  I am not affiliated with that company, but I am a bitcoin enthusiast.Thanks for your time,JimOn Fri, Oct 7, 2011 at 9:00 AM, brian wrote:Jim, thanks for your note.  I hadn't heard of bitcoins before, but did take the time to look at their site.  It's not something we support currently, but if it gains mass appeal we will certainly take a look at it in the future.  Thanks for your note.On Thu, Oct 6, 2011 at 7:10 PM, Jim wrote:Hi,Can you support buying food with bitcoins?  If you don't know what bitcoins are see weusecoins.comThanks,Jim awesome This is a great post of bitcoin being used in real life.  Thanks for sharing.

Crowdin is kind of hard to use.  When I imported the text it was in the right order but seems like crowdin mixes it up a little bit.  I am hoping all of the text should be there, even if it is not in the right order.Once the translations are in, what I can do is select "Build Package".  What this will do is that the crowdin server will convert all the sentences and output it to the "Downloads" section.  I just built a package so if you go to the "Downloads" section and click on your language it will have your translations in the right order.For example go 1.) http://crowdin.net/project/bitcoin.  2.) Select your language (German) 3.) Click on "Download".  It will download de.zip.  Unzip it.  4.) There will be a file call bitcoins.html.  Open this with Notepad (if you open in a browser it will all be in one line).  The file should have the translations in the right order. I decided to wake up at 3AM in the morning to answer your question.  :-)  I checked if you can access the older revisions.  It looks like you can but it seems like you can only access one or the other but not both.  There is this file format called "tmx".  It has some translations in it and I've put it in this document.  I don't know if it will help you:   https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B1UsG65HCLkuNGQyYzU1NmQtZmE4ZS00YWM0LWJjNWYtMDZhYzQwZjc1ZGI4&hl=en_USI don't know why crowdin seems to "randomize" the order.  If crowdin is not a good tool to use for your language, I guess I am open for others to do it in Word.  The problem I see with this, however, is I won't be able to convert it to PDF and I don't know what English word correlates to the translated word.  So you will have to do all of the work should you decide to translate it without using crowdin.As for the right-to-left question, what I do to generate the PDF is to do it manually, line by line, so it takes a bit of time.  Are the Hebrew translations right-to-left in crowd-in?  What I do is I copy the sentence, and I paste it in OpenDraw.  I just copied a Hebrew sentence from crowdin and I pasted it in OpenDraw, and it seemed to paste ok.  It seems like a bunch of squiggles to me so I have no idea if it is right-to-left.  Maybe if I have a sample sentence you can paste here I can use? Yea, I know. :-(  I feel pretty bad people may have wasted a few hours of their time.  But, I made the decision to do it because there are 100+ languages that need to be translated and the sentences needs to be complete.  Please let me know how I can make your life any easier. I guess to some people the paper is no big deal.  When I read it, for me it was a big deal.  That is now why I am putting my bitcoins into it. Yea, sorry about that. :-(I also want to let everyone know that I am currently paying a Chinese person to translate the document and do the entire PDF in Chinese.  For the ones which I am paying for I will put at the top, "Translation paid for by bitcoinblogger.com".  I will be paying 20BTC.  If you want to work on another language let me know.I think this is a good opportunity for people to have some sort of advertising at the top of the PDF. Ok, I converted the document into sentences.  I apologize for this.  Still new at this. Ok, I will wait on making a PDF.  I wanted to show some progress to get people to work on it. Thanks for your efforts. If this is a problem I can try and redo it so it has sentences and paragraphs instead of lines.   Looks like the Germans are winning the translation contest with 41% complete.  Thank you.  Here is a sneak peek of the German PDF:Übersetzung ins Deutsche in progress.

WiseOldOwl, if you could make an effort to get people to chant, "Use Bitcoins!  Use Bitcoins!  Use Bitcoins!", I would be in awe of you. I've been in the forums long enough and I know of a Wallstreet protester long before the occupywallstreet came into existence.  I paid a guy 100 BTC to hold a sign in front on the NYSE in Wallstreet to stand there for a few hours holding a sign that said "End the Fed!  Use Bitcoins!"  It's all on video.  I think I still have it.  He was the original protester! The media is complaining there is no message.  The message should be "End the Fed.  Use Bitcoins!!!" This is awesome. Bitcoin is bigger than the Internet. China is going tone huge.  Once China catches on then S. Korea and other Asian countries will follow.   Bitcoin will do to banking what bittorrent did to copyright. Are these international Visas?  I just bought some Visas and they only work in the U.S.   +1 Some people like grandmas might be intimidated by the QR Code and camera concept.  Have you guys looked into http://bu.mp?See this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=45315.0 What was wrong with it? http://bu.mp/Seems like most bitcoin apps are using QR Codes which can be a pain since you have to use a camera to take a pic of it.  Has anyone looked into  http://bu.mp/?  All you need is to bump two phones together and the bitcoins can be transferred.  No need for NFC chip. I can't believe this was thought of years ago.  I wonder how many more years until this becomes a mainstream reality. I agree with this. +1 Another article:http://siliconangle.com/blog/2011/08/29/bitcoin-delivers-confidence-for-online-casinos/ You are correct.  Although I think the general idea of bitcoin and cryptography gave the concept of using cryptography to determine fairness a push.  Check out this article.  It's spreading!http://siliconangle.com/blog/2011/08/29/bitcoin-delivers-confidence-for-online-casinos/ The bitcoin casino industry could take off because of this fairness advantage.  People are always looking for fair casino games! http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/08/bitcoins-give-rise-to-crypto-casinos.html If I were to convince a merchant on how much they would save if they accepted bitcoins instead of credit card or paypal, the merchant may like to know dollar amounts of savings for their business.I've heard 1-2% transaction fee charges for credit card or for using paypal.  But, I would like to know if anyone can give real dollar amounts of actual bitcoin savings.  I think companies like bit-pay.com could use this information as a marketing advantage.Does anyone have any idea? Here is some speculation...if bitcoin continues to grow exponentially then we'll see bitcoin hit $40 to $150 per bitcoin in the next rally.  Maybe it will happen in September.  See graph.   This is a logarithmic graph:
Careful...could be stolen credit cards. What genjix is doing is very impressive so far...this could be "the" library. I put it on -nolisten and the bitcoin client works.  However, I think this will be problem for many users and if I have this issue then many more others may not be able to get their bitcoin client running.  I checked my router logs but I don't know enough to debug it.   I hope this issue is fixed. I was working with another fellow developing an ATM machine.  However, things are not going as planned business wise so I am trying to explore my options.  I am the sole programmer for the ATM and may open source the software depending on how much interest there is here.  The Bitcoin ATM software is almost done.  I have been able to put in bills and out comes bitcoins to your bitcoin address!The reason why I want to opensource the software is because I want it to spread as far as possible.  Anyone should be able to set up a bitcoin ATM anywhere.  In addition, the team I was working with did not involve me during contract negotiations of the formation of the company so I feel a bit left out and may venture on my own.  What do you guys think?  I need to make a decision in the next few days. Dwolla's arrogance and refusing to acknowledge bitcoin is killing me.  The title speaks for itself, "Weve got some cool communications tools in the works and its all because of our customers". Thank you very much for your response. Seems like they are not cool.  They think they are too good for us.  They don't mention bitcoin.  They talk to us via a press release.  Shame on Dwolla. If you guys are out there you guys really need to use https instead of just http for your calls.  It is not safe without it.  Sorry if I sounded off the mark.  I guess I just want a solution to not having to supply an incremental nonce.  A nonce, in the security world, can even be a unique id, which I can generate no problem using C# guid.  Their trading API limits my application which will be distributed, and I am hoping they will make it better.  Or, if they can let me know that I can supply a user and pass instead of the key, secret, and hash of the post then I'll be happy too.  Yes, I am kind of vague but I don't think I can talk about the application I am working on yet until it is ready.  This has nothing to do with my question but thanks for the tip.  I do have a Yubikey. You want 1000 accounts for 1000 machines?  That sounds even less pleasant. In the trading API you have to specify a "nonce" parameter of an increasing integer value.  This is fine for non-distributed apps.  However, we are developing a distributed app that could be deployed to hundreds or thousands of machines.  This nonce value will be harder to increment in synchronization since normally it is based on a computer's clock.  If two transactions were happening at near the same time, it is possible a late request might arrive before the earlier request due to the unpredictable nature of the Internet.  Is it possible to supply a unique identifier for the nonce instead of an increasing value?The other solution would be to supply a username and password but I don't know how long this will be supported.Thanks. Thank you.  I got it working without the username and password.  Awesome.  PM me about your service. Thanks for that!    I'll have to take a look at it tonight after work.  I noticed there was a method in there "EncodeParamsToSecret( parameters );" that was not in the code you posted.  You don't mind posting that method do you (without the key and secret of course.) Anyways, here is my C# code which I don't think is working.  I get "{"error":"Must be logged in"}" A little help anyone?Code:     Console.Out.WriteLine("Making withdraw request to Mt. Gox...");                        HttpWebRequest request =                 (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("https://mtgox.com/api/0/withdraw.php");            request.Method = WebRequestMethods.Http.Post;            request.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; .NET CLR 1.0.3705;)";            String btcAddr = mainForm.getSendToBitcoinAddress();            String btcAmount = .01;            String nonce = DateTime.UtcNow.Millisecond.ToString();            Console.Out.WriteLine("nonce: " + nonce);                     string postData = "group1=BTC&btca=" + btcAddr + "&amount="                                     + btcAmount + "&nonce=" + nonce;            String key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";            String keySecret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";            byte[] keyByte = Convert.FromBase64String(keySecret);            HMACSHA512 hmacsha512 = new HMACSHA512(keyByte);            System.Text.ASCIIEncoding encoding = new System.Text.ASCIIEncoding();            byte[] messageBytes = encoding.GetBytes(postData);            byte[] hashmessage = hmacsha512.ComputeHash(messageBytes);            String base64SignedPostData = Convert.ToBase64String(hashmessage);            request.Headers.Add("Rest-Key", key);            request.Headers.Add("Rest-Sign", base64SignedPostData);            byte[] byteArray = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(postData);            request.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";            request.ContentLength = byteArray.Length;            Stream dataStream = request.GetRequestStream();            dataStream.Write(byteArray, 0, byteArray.Length);            dataStream.Close();            WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();            Console.WriteLine(((HttpWebResponse)response).StatusDescription);            dataStream = response.GetResponseStream();            StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(dataStream);            string responseFromServer = reader.ReadToEnd();            Console.WriteLine(responseFromServer);            //Clean up the streams.            reader.Close();            dataStream.Close();            response.Close(); Interesting bot.I don't know why but I had to add 'user' and 'pass' to get mine to work in addition to supplying the api key and the secret key.  What I am doing still works though but I am afraid that I am doing it the wrong way. I am using a modification of this PHP code which I ported to C#.  In this example there was no 'user' or 'pass' variable.  Should these variables be in the documentation?https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MtGox/API#Authentication Ok, I got a little further.  I am not using CURL.  I am using C#.This answer is not even in the documentation or wiki.  I found it in another post.  I added user=xxx&pass=xxx to the POST data and it worked. I am trying to convert the Mt. Gox code to C# and I am gettingOK{"error":"Must be logged in"}Not sure what to do next...any ideas?
Ok, setting the user agent worked and I can now get ticker info.  Weird because other sites don't require the user agent.  Thx!!! Jered, how is the user withdraw to another user API call coming along?  Any luck with it coming out in the next couple of days? I'm doing a basic connection using .NET and I'm trying to get ticker info from Mt. Gox.http://mtgox.com/api/0/data/ticker.phpHowever, it just hangs.  I've tried to connect to TradeHill's API ticker and it works fine for http, https, etc.I tried to load mtgox.com but it hangs.  Something about Mt. Gox's server is causing .NET to hang.The code below doesn't work.  It works for all other sites including Trade Hill's https, http, cnn.com, etc.Code:            WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create("https://mtgox.com/api/0/data/ticker.php");            request.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;            WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();            //Console.WriteLine(((HttpWebResponse)response).StatusDescription);            Stream dataStream = response.GetResponseStream();            StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(dataStream);            string responseFromServer = reader.ReadToEnd();            //Console.WriteLine(responseFromServer);Any ideas? Suppose I am checking out and the store has an account at tradehill.com.  I have an account at tradehill.com.  I want to use tradehill (or whatever service) to send bitcoins to him instantly through an api call.  My coins in my tradehill account will go to the store's account instantly and I can leave. First thing I noticed was no "https" in the api call which makes me not want to use it... Ok, I'll be looking forward to this...I'll need it for the app I am working on. I didn't see user-to-user trades in the API:  https://www.campbx.com/api.phpCan you point them out to me? Keyur,Can you make the send btc api call instant?  If a campbx user sends coins to another campbx user can you make it so the receiver gets them instantly?  This is important for buying things so the buyer and seller doesn't have to wait for the next block.Jim I need an API to send payments instantly.  At one point in time Mt. Gox had a way to send bitcoin payments instantly but I think it has been disabled.  CampBX just introduced an API to send payments but I don't know if it is instant or not.  MyBitcoin has an SCI shopping cart interface but I don't know if they have the ability to send bitcoins instantly with an API.For example, here is CampBX's instant payment call:An API call to send Bitcoins to an address can be made in following format:https://CampBX.com/api/sendbtc.php POST: user=USERNAME pass=PASSWORD BTCTo=ADDRESS BTCAmt=DECIMALWhat is the best way to send bitcoins instantly without having to wait for a block?  I don't mind if two users have to have an account at Mt. Gox or mybitcoin.com to send bitcoin payments to each other. Every time I run bitcoin, my wireless connection crashes.  I have a USB wireless key fob.  What I have found is that I have to pull it out and stick it back in to reset it, and my wireless comes back on.  All other internet connections work when I don't run bitcoin.  When I play StarCraft online it works.  When I surf the net or run mining software (poclbm's version) my wireless connection works.However, when I start up the bitcoin client after a few minutes the wireless connection fails.  Weird.  I am wondering if it has to do with all of those connections.  You will show off tattoo?  I would go if I lived in Vegas.   It's on the front page 7-13-2011 4:11 PM PSThttp://hardware.slashdot.org/story/11/07/13/2227223/Bitcoin-Mining-Tests-On-16-NVIDIA-and-AMD-GPUs If the Fed says gold is an asset, then are bitcoins an asset?http://blogs.forbes.com/afontevecchia/2011/07/13/bernanke-fights-ron-paul-in-congress-golds-not-money/ I'm color blind.  Can't see some of the colors... Nice...thx for posting this. The bitcoin android app released yesterday is based on bitcoinj.  They were both created by Google developers.https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bitcoinandroid http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/07/bitcoin-atm-is-coming-at-location-near.htmlIf the cards fall into place bitcoin ATMs may be on the way.There are many annoyances with bitcoin including the following:1.) Bitcoins are very difficult to obtain on the Internet.2.) It is near impossible for an average user to generate bitcoins with his or her computer. 3.) Technical skill is required to obtain bitcoins via an online exchange.4.) If money is sent from a bank account to an online exchange then the transaction is no longer anonymous and that money can be traced.5.) Sending cash in the mail for bitcoins could take days, weeks, or not at all and is unreliable.What is the solution to these many problems? Multiple teams within the United States are attempting to build and distribute ATMs in mass quantities. ATMs will allow bitcoins to be distributed anonymously with cash without the need for an exchange. With bitcoin ATMs it will only be a drive away before an average person can buy bitcoins! The value of bitcoin will skyrocket once a non-technical user can buy bitcoins as easy as buying local goods.There are many ways to distribute bitcoins with an ATM and each development team is handling them uniquely. I could explain in further detail in how these bitcoin ATMs would work, but to protect the business interests of my sources I am going to remain quite for now. Who will win the race to provide the best bitcoin ATM with the most locations?Here is an early attempt of one team hacking open an eBay bought ATM:http://biticon.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/bitcoin-atm/http://biticon.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/atm-progress/ Samsung WebCL:http://code.google.com/p/webcl/ Video:http://www.youtube.com/user/SamsungSISA If you truly believed in bitcoins, wouldn't you want to invest in bitcoins?I would invest in a fund that traded bitcoins but not any other investment types. what language are you using?  why don't you use svn or github?
An encrypted wallet could protect a user completely compromised by a root-kit trojan.  I don't see how cutting and pasting an encrypted wallet over to a service (dropbox) or device (android phone) is any different than splitting keys. There is a chance that Kevin might be a genius and/or lucky.  When I saw it drop on Mt. Gox I was trying to place orders on the way down.  I placed several orders during the course of several minutes and it was going lower and lower.  I think when it hit .01 I even placed an order but I had to cancel it since it was put on hold since there were no more coins left.  Then I bought some coins above $10 a coin.  I am glad I did not get those coins.  I do not want the FBI to show up at my door.Here was what I said on facebook right afterwards, " I saw it happening and tried to place orders at $14, $13, $10, and so on but it said a trade was occurring and wouldn't place my order. When it reached around $3 I was becoming skeptical. When it reached $0.01 I placed a trade to see if it would execute but it didn't. So I cancelled it and the last price was around 13. I placed an order for 12, I think, and it got filled. Now Mt. Gox is down. This is just so crazy and intense. A volume of 500,000 is 8% of bitcoins currently in existence. I am thinking only satoshi would own that many coins.  I thought to myself...is this a gift from satoshi? Or is it a hacking attempt? Or, some big players? I have no idea." What time did Kevin put the .01 order in?  Also, what was the price of bitcoin when the order was put in?If Kevin put in the order when the price of bitcoin was $15 that just doesn't make sense... When the value of bitcon was dropping from 15ish to .01, did Kevin place orders in between?  For example, when it dropped to 10 did you place an order for $10 a bitcoin?  Or did you only place that .01ish order immediately? More like 10-15 minutes.

Ummm, msnbc?  Jim Cramer? Wall Street Journal? I have made 463 posts, I'm a senior forum member, I run my own bitcoin blog since last year and no respect?  Oh well...I know you're just kidding...I think.I don't think it has hit mainstream media yet but it's working its way up.  Wait until bitcoin hits the front page of cnn.com or drudgereport.com.  Then the words 'bitcoin' will come out of Tom Brokaw's mouth. I have a source that says a Bitcoin article will be in Bloomberg/Businessweek in the next publication.  There may be a pic of memorydealer.com's sign in it.  Just wanted to let ya'll know... Yea, my tone is pretty bad, I apologize.  This seems like a great event for people to connect developers who are interested in bitcoins.I guess I don't like to see developers possibly wasting their time and money to attend an event that seems to be recruiting people for startups and telling them to develop apps so they can measure their talent.  The event could entirely be useful for both parties, though. I'm near San Diego...can't pay with bitcoins?They want me to spend all day on a Saturday weekend programming throw-away applications? The GUI is excellent.  I am thinking 'Checking' and 'Savings' are the basic accounts.  They can add more accounts if they want to.  For wallet encryption are you going to use TrueCrypt? Whoa, I typed that?!?!?!  Good catch! I bet you don't have a wife or kids.  Maybe not even a girlfriend to support.  My finance would kill me if I went all into bitcoins.  You are in a good spot...good luck to you!

This is bitcoin fever, similar to gold fever. It doesn't matter if you're moving dirt to find gold or solving puzzles.  Work is work.  Work is money.  Time is money. http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/cpus/2011/05/30/amd-betting-everything-on-opencl/1 I thought it was a good interview of an average bitcoin user/miner.  There are a lot of people like him trying to mine/understand/sell bitcoins.  He didn't say anything wrong, really, and did point out he didn't understand all of it. hehe Doesn't work..why?

Dear Sir or Madam,I am inquiring you on this day because my mother has lung cancer and is in need of some medical assistance.  I was seeking a bank wire to my bank account of $5000 USD.  However, my bank has stopped all transactions that are under my name due to my name resembling the Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange.  My mother may die a slow and painful death if I do not obtain this money to pay for her surgery.  I recently discovered that bitcoins could be a way to transfer money and I am seeking your help because you are a kind and wealthy individual that was lucky enough to earn all of your bitcoins.  Please send payment in bitcoins to 1GETVVdhsNpfoyPSdt4n6S7Eep5va2DBwb and I will pray for you and your family.  Any amount will do.  When you ascend in the heavens you will be rewarded with many, many virgins.Jules Assango1GETVVdhsNpfoyPSdt4n6S7Eep5va2DBwb  very nice...i needed this. when is the next show?  we ARE in first place.  I expect a show on bitcoin now.
heh, good stuff.   what made you want to do this?  Great work.  Do you have to install the WebCL plugin? wow, almost number one!  keep voting!!! Mike, I was just wondering how long it will be before you feel confident in BitcoinJ such that you would recommend it for large transactions? Don't get scammed.  Use ClearCoin.com!

Ok, the blog article I wrote was a little...sensational.  Oh well, I'm just a blogger creating controversy.To answer your question what if staying on the website made more money than to redirect users through the click?  Putting in ads could redirect users which would mine less for the website...shrug. http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/05/google-could-be-destroyed-javascript.htmlDiscuss.There is a new and revolutionary breakthrough bitcoin application that could potentially destroy Google.

Lift your mining rigs.  Turn ur mining rigs into a sauna.   There is some China and Japan nodes.  MtGox is run from Japan.  I am just surprised there are no Koreans since they have the best broadband, gaming, and Internet services.  Any Koreans here? ideally that would be good but bitcoin is not implemented that way for a number of good reasons. Read this:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/ScalabilityIf you read satoshi's paper it will describe a system to validate a transaction without having to download the blocks.  This is implemented in BitcoinJ, the android implementation.  Look for "Simplified Payment Verification". S. Korea has a massive gaming and Internet base.  But, there are no bitcoin nodes there.  Zilch.  Do we have a Korean translation? Why do people move dirt to find gold?   seanadams, do u have any experience in this?  I think a pink sheet stock could work.  It's under the radar since it's not SEC regulated. satoshi, the creator, is known to have a large number of bitcoins.  How many?  I don't think we will ever know.  There are 6 million bitcoins in existence now which is about a quarter of all the bitcoins, a total of 21 million, that will exist.My take on it is that satoshi did not know if his project will succeed or fail.  At the time bitcoins were less than 1 cent each. This is a tough one...eMansipater, a bitcoin.org global moderator, vs the MadHatter.  I don't know who is right on this one...
http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/05/bitbillscom-review.htmlI recently ordered some bitbill.com cards in the mail and they have arrived! Wahoo! I ordered each type of bitbill (1, 5, 10, and 20 BTC) but they all didn't arrive yet so hopefully the rest will arrive soon. I only got the 1 BTC bitbills as of now.So what did I think of them? Well, they looked just like what I had ordered, however, the cards themselves don't have the feel of credit cards. The material is not as strong as a conventional credit card. There seems to be a thin piece of plastic sandwiched between two sheets of clear plastic. When you rub your thumb over the hologram it is raised so there is definitely something under there. The private-key-QR-Code is an actual piece of paper under the hologram. The larger public-key-QR-Code looks like it was printed on the card since I could not feel the bump using my thumb. The circular hologram on the front is some type of metal foil that rests on top of the QR Code. The rectangular hologram on the back is also raised. The hologram on the back says "AUTHENTIC", "GENUINE", "VALID", and "SECURITY", and the front hologram has a globe that has the words, "SECURE".The edges of the bitbill look like they have been cut with minute fraying on the edges. The cards still look pretty cool though, and it does say "beta" on it. I expect bitbills.com to make the cards even better in the near future, but this is a good beta.I have an Android smart phone and I used an app named Google Googles to take a picture of the public-key-QR-code on the back of the card. Google Googles was able to successfully convert the public-key-QR-Code into a bitcoin address. I entered the key into blockexplorer.com to verify if there was 1 BTC on the card, and I am happy to say there was. :-)I do not think it is possible to remove the hologram on top of the private key QR Code without significantly destroying the card. In the next few days I will be attempting to remove the private key QR Code without destroying the card. This is just a test of the card and I do not have malicious intent. :-) What if the bitcoins are destroyed?  Are you burning legal or illegal tender? Either way, both parties seem to be acknowledging that bitcoins is, indeed, real.  At least there is a positive in all of this. :-P Bitcoins were also worth a lot less in Feb when knightmb did the deal.  I hope everything works out for everyone. Beacon, is a newbie with one post.  Could be fake.  Beacon, do you know the full story?  Sounds like knightmb just pulled off a Louisiana Purchase.  The U.S. did it to France and I don't see what knightmb did wrong...unless there is more to the story... knightmb, this is an amazing story...can I post this in my blog? I wrote this on July 13, 2010 about a system for companies to use bitcoins but no one (zero people) replied.  Maybe it is time to develop software for companies to use bitcoins.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=329.msg2651#msg2651 I think satoshi tried to emulate the aspects of gold.  He did compare gold mining and bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is worth as much as people think it is worth. If people understand that it is hard to make bitcoins then it will give value to bitcoins. I was just thinking...maybe we can re-add the "Generate Coins" in the menu but also put in "Estimated Time to find coins" somewhere so people don't get as frustrated.Don't take out "Generate Coins"! I think I disagree with this decision and here is my reasoning:Mining is comparable to mining for gold.  Personally, I am a gold miner and have access to gold claims.  I started mining for gold with a gold pan.  I remember going to rivers and panning for gold but I didn't find any gold.  The gold pan was what I started off with and it sort of gave me "gold fever".  In fact, many gold miners start off with basic tools but when one tool was not sufficient then upgrades were necessary.I think the "Generate Coins" in the menu is similar to the basic plastic gold pan because it give people a glimpse of what mining is.  It is what starts off the "gold fever" (aka "bitcoin fever").  Gold fever is real and I believe bitcoin fever is very similar.  Just Google "gold fever" and you will see thousands and thousands of hits.The "Generate Coins" may frustrate people but it gives more value to bitcoins by introducing people to mining.  The reason why you guys want to get rid of it is because you are already old timers and have upgraded all your equipment to sluice boxes, dump trucks, and heavy machinery.  For the newbies it gives them a chance to have the same feeling and thus attract more people to the bitcoin community. Password cracking have been used successfully a while back at mtgox until mtgox changed their login process.  Has this been ruled out? Seems like bitcoin2cash wins this round over bitcoin4cash . . .I've used both bitcoin4cash and bitcoin2cash's services...sent my money, did some trades, and got my bitcoins.  I worked with bitcoin4cash six months ago and everything was still affordable with less risk.  Now that bitcoins are worth a lot, more is at stake and people's reputation are on the line.I will most likely use bitcoin2cash's service again over bitcoin4cash only because my letter does not have to cross borders.  If you live in the U.S. your letter will reach its destination faster since bitcoin2cash is based in the U.S. and does not have to pass through customs.  I will also be mailing small increments of money so there is less risk.bitcoin2cash's openid system is a little tricky and you have to make sure you remember your openid url exactly.  Otherwise you will not be able to login.There is always a risk so be careful! If you have a dynamic IP don't forget to log the IP of you own machine before it changes. Also, if you are using 'MemoryDealers' as your user name or your email address that you display publicly then I suggest you use a non-well-known email address. Is it insured shipping?Can you explain your manufacturing process and how it is secure?  During the manufacturing process who sees the QR Code? "Money doesn't grow on trees, it grows in bitcoin rigs." TravelEx is a currency exchange with a physical location that has branches throughout the world.  In fact they have over 200 stores in the U.S. and more around the world.  TravelEx is a store that essentially exhanges currency.I believe Bitcoin is a good opportunity for TravelEx.  I have been thinking about this a lot and here is how it would work.Forum members contact TravelEx headquarters.  We tell them that there is a high demand to convert cash to Bitcoins and there is an opportunity for them to get rich.  (Who doesn't want to get rich?)Then we have bitbills.com create thousands of bitbills to be shipped to all the TravelExs around the world.  People come into the store, buy bitbills with their cash using the current exchange rate.  TravelEx takes some profit, bitbills.com takes some profit, the bitcoin economy booms, and the new bitcoin owner is happy with his/her purchase.  Everyone wins.TravelEx could also send the bitcoins electronically but I think bitbills will be easier for them to understand and it will be easier to handle since it is physical and TravelEx is a physical location.I don't see any holes with this idea and it is TravelEx's for the taking.  So who wants to contact TravelEx/Bitbills.com on this idea? Not sure if I am answering your question but y=mx + b is a high school algebra equation for a line on a graph.  Using this equation or some other polynomial equation to predict the size of the next block shouldn't be too hard.  Just plug in values for m, x, and b and solve for y.http://www.math.com/school/subject2/lessons/S2U4L2DP.htmlI think Gavin is right in that we need some data, maybe plot it on a graph, and determine which method/equation can best fit that graph.Just my two millicoins. Silicon Valley represent! Very good!
I think averaging the "last N blocks in the best chain" is good but there may be a better way.  How about we try to predict the size of the next block?  We take the last N blocks and determine if it is linear, exponential, or polynomial.  Then we solve the linear or polynomial equation to determine the N+1 point.  Basically, this method is attempting to predict the size of the next block.We can start of simple, and just use y=mx+b.   Don't forget to take pics of the billboard and to post it here! I like how bitcoin is large.  People who see the sign will definitely notice the sign and your business.  Basically you are taking the viral and social nature of bitcoin and this will rub off on your company.  Since you are the first to do this it will have a really good effect, imo.Black and yellow is a really good color combination since it makes the bitcoin stand out.  Maybe change the orange to yellow and it might also match better with the coin.Since you live in Silicon Valley I would write, "We accept BitCoin" and near the bottom in small letters "P2P Cryptocurrency" or "Decentralized Cryptocurrency"Thanks for doing this!!! In terms of scalability, could a two-tier system be developed where super users would run the main bitcoin client that would store and verify the block chain and on the second tier normal users would use a lesser version of the client such as BitCoinJ (that does not store the block chain and is only used for verification of payments?)If bitcoin goes mainstream and takes as many transactions as Visa (thousands per second) then would Bitcoin(supernode)/BitcoinJ(node) be a solution?  Not everyone can afford racks of computers... Why do u hate the cia so much? Did they kill ur mom or dad! What did they do to ur family?The U.S. and prob the CIA prob killed a lot of people in my parents country of origin but I don't harbor any anger.  I could get philosophical but I'm not going to.Cia got bin ladin.  Woot. what's the hashrate of the rig/card? I, myself, am also a gold miner and I also have gold mining equipment.  Back in the old days people panned for gold in rivers and the gold automatically collected in certain areas of a river.  Gold was easy to collect and pan out.  Once all of the "easy gold" was found it I imagine gold become more and more valuable because of the scarcity and the difficulty to find gold.  So similarly, when bitcoins become harder to mine it will increase in value. I recommend updating to 0.3.21 since it has important bug fixes. I would update on a case by case basis depending on what fix or features added. Amazing...great work guys. Agree with [mike].  It is pretty obvious that allowing domain name registration info in the block chain does not scale.  If you open the doorway to domains, other potential applications using P2P could also do the same causing the chain to bloat.  It truly is about solid engineering.This is pretty obvious.  Registering a domain must cost something so all the names will not be taken.  One cannot just get it for 'free'. Voted. I agree with [mike] in that what satoshi says has more weight than what we say.  I like the concept of shared work with bitcoin miners.  It will only make the bitcoin more valuable and I'm all for that.  Shared work is also what satoshi recommended.I would also say that what [mike] says carries more weight than some others on this board, simply because he works for Google and also for implementing the BitcoinJ project.  Google only hires the best of the best of the best. I am installing this...it was a very hard install...attempting to register but it stalls. Crude, but entertaining. Credit card companies charge transaction fees (along with FB credits etc.)  So yes it is different than paper dollars.  If you own the medium of exchange then u can charge for ridiculous fees, inflate the currency, etc.  Bitcoin solves all of these problems. Repetition is effective:"Again, go to weusecoins.com to learn more.  weusecoins.com" This version sounds better.  If you need save a few seconds then this line could go or be replaced.   "Do you want to take back control of your own money?"  Maybe replace it with, "Are you sick of the gov't bailing out Wall St?"  (People are impulsive and emotional and we should use this to our advantage.)Are you tired of watching the value of the dollar plummet?Are you tired of banks charging you fees?Are you sick of the gov't bailing out Wall St?Then take a look at Bitcoin!Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized, anonymous internet currency, and is gaining popularity every day.It's free to use, free to accept, and free from inflation---forever!You can use bitcoins anywhere in the world, and their value will only grow with time.To learn more, visit weusecoins.comOh one more thing...its weusecoins.com NOT .org!!! Heh... Great work!  Maybe you should sell carrots too for fun.  weusecarrots.com What if a normal user decides he wants to join the bitcoin lottery?  Chances will be low but if he/she finds a 50 BTC block then it's rags to riches.
You mean 5/9.  Oh, good job! Nice, maybe add wattage used too to calculate electricity costs. Putting on 2 CD-R and Flash doesn't seem to be enough for 300,000K bitcoins.  Maybe you can tease us by encrypting the wallet with TrueCrypt, give it a 20 char password, and post it here.  You can be sure the wallet will continue to exist on the Internet and it will be safe. I was wondering the same thing.  I sent him a PM a while back but no response.  I think he wants to keep his identity a secret. Best bitcoin site I've seen in a while. Gavin,It it possible to convince the CIA to pay you in bitcoins?  That would be awesome.  (Maybe not the full $3000 but half in bitcoins?) CIA will put a bug in Gavin's house, tap his phone, and attach a GPS to his car.  They goal is to find out who Satoshi is.  Beware!!! It has to go through customs, probably.  Yea, it takes a while...give it some time. This is a good service.  How much to play you and get a tutorial on each game? slush or deepbit could decide to be evil and run their own version of bitcoin.  But I imagine their bitcoin mining pool flock would fly to another pool if this was the case. This line needs to be added to the poem:Satoshi is rich. I hear about this all the time...the chain forking...what's the easiest way to detect a fork?  Can someone develop this and put it on a website? I will buy from you...$1 per bitcoin...maybe. What is your net worth?  So your 95% of your fortune is in BTC? They should have used bitcoin, they should have used bitcoin...http://money.cnn.com/2011/04/15/news/economy/online_poker_indictments/index.htm?hpt=T2By Ben Rooney, staff reporterApril 15, 2011: 3:25 PM ETNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The founders of the three largest Internet poker companies have been indicted for bank fraud and money laundering, federal law enforcement officials said Friday.The United States Attorney in New York unsealed the indictment against eleven people, including the founders of PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker.In addition, federal authorities filed civil charges against the poker companies and several payment processors for alleged money laundering.Some of the defendants were arrested Friday, including individuals who worked on behalf of the poker companies to obtain U.S. bank accounts.Prosecutors said they were working with foreign law enforcement agencies and Interpol to secure the arrest of other defendants who are not in the United States.Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, said the defendants tricked some banks and bribed others "to assure the continued flow of billions in illegal gambling profits.""Moreover, as we allege, in their zeal to circumvent the gambling laws, the defendants also engaged in massive money laundering and bank fraud," Bharara said in a statement.Prosecutors are seeking at least $3 billion in civil penalties and forfeiture from the poker companies and the defendants."These defendants, knowing full well that their business with U.S. customers and U.S. banks was illegal, tried to stack the deck," said Janice Fedarcyk, FBI assistant director-in-charge. "They lied to banks about the true nature of their business. Then, some of the defendants found banks willing to flout the law for a fee." I had a physics class once that gave out quizzes at the beginning of class on nearly each class session.  I would take the quiz that lasted 10 min and leave each class.  Then I found out the teacher then gave quizzes at the end of class just to screw with the people that!  Physics is pretty textbook and should not be mandatory.  Everything is in the book. At the end of this video have a guy keep yelling, "FOX...LIES!  FOX...LIES!  FOX...LIES!!!" over and over. reading the other thread and this one, I can see bitcoin2cash's point of view.  bitcoin2cash is really trying to open a legal business.  for example his business has an LLC to protect his personal wealth.  madhatter prefers to work in the dark away from legal or govt intervention.  bitcoin2cash already says he doesnt need advice but the madhatter just keeps adding input.I'd like 2 c bitcoin2cash do what madhatter cannot be done.  it would be a leap in bitoin adoption bitcoin2cash, when I click on 'FAQ' or 'About Us' it doesn't work. 456540
I think what turned me off about the freestateinitiative was because of how the site utilized Singapore and Hong Kong as examples to strive for.  Also, the freestateinitiative seemed to look down on western governments as failures when for some people it is a beacon of light.In addition, there are a lot of concepts on your website that needs to be clarified.  For example, making things private is not the way to be free.  I think a free state should instead revolve its core principles on basic human rights, which should be guaranteed somehow to people living in the free state.Some loop holes that really bother me is that what if there was someone how owned 100% of the water resources, 100% or the roads, etc?  That would be a monopoly and he could charge fees, deny travel, or limit water resources.Anyways... You nothing about me and you obviously can't read either.  Again, you are generalizing and stereotyping Westerners.  You don't even know if I am a Westerner or if I am or have lived in poverty.  You don't know if I have toil for long hours trying to get basic amenities.  You come to all of these conclusions because you have a huge chip on your shoulder.  Clearly you are a bigoted person who has a distaste for Westerners.  The reason why I brought up chewing gum is because that is where it starts.  Next you there will be rules on how to flush the toilet, how to marry, what to wear or not wear, how to walk, etc.  Each freedom is being taking away until there is little or no more freedom.Here is some bigoted bullshit from your website that need specific examples: "In the West diversity is hailed in all areas except in material matters. Economic diversity is generally considered a huge evil and as a consequence Western countries set up huge immigration barriers that keep all the poor people on the outside, without access to the opportunities to improve their lives. In this way self-righteous Westerners are able to maintain the illusion of social equality. Out of sight, out of mind. As long as there are no visibly poor people in the West, people can pretend that there is material equality, even though there are still just as many poor people that just happen to live somewhere else. And worse: these poor are working in factories with bad conditions in their own countries to produce goods that are consumed in the West. In this way Westerners get to enjoy the fruits of cheap labor while preaching social equality."More bigoted bullshit that needs specific examples:"Western nations were redesigned during the Enlightenment more than 200 years ago, with the intention of taming government once and for all. They failed and the Western countries have largely returned to the feudal and corporatist welfare states that dominated earlier times." Ok, this is starting to get personal.  Attacking Westerners now, huh?   Claiming Westerners don't know how to feed their family or work long hours?  Claiming that I don't deserve to live in a free country?I think you don't even know what a free country is.  From what I read, you think being free is being able to get as rich as possible without government interference.  There are other freedoms like freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of ideas, etc.  In places like Singapore these freedoms are restricted.  In places like the United States, it is now possible for gay people to become legally married.  People in the U.S. can organize and protest in front of the White House.  In Wisconsin there were protesters by the thousands in the state capitol and their rights were protected.So I don't think you truly appreciate or know what freedom is.  All you care about is money. YES.  This sums up to exactly what I am thinking.  It is masking itself behind the word free when it is not really free. I agree it is absurd and gibberish. I don't have time to debate the fancy website.  Stop saying Singapore an HK are the most free, economically free, whatever free.  Can I open a strip club in Singapore?  I cannot even sell chewing gum.  Give me a break.  If I sell medical marijuana there I'll be executed.   The website "http://freestateinitiative.org" and onarchy is just totally vague and confusing.  On so many points they contradict their own points it just doesn't make sense.You think Singapore and Hong Kong are close to "Free States"?  WTH?  They have progressed very quickly but they are not free.  If you spit gum on the sidewalk there is a fine.  In fact, they have banned chewing gum.  There are cameras in every public restroom.  If you don't flush the toilet or urinal you will be fined.  Singapore is becoming like a big brother state.freestateinitiative right now is a joke to me. There is a chance your route has toll roads...how will you deal with this?  This video needs to go on the front page of every website including bitcoin.org. LOL, to bad you are not a Chinese student.  I would give you 1 BTC. This is the most confusing joke I have read here.  0 BTC. I did not laugh.  The poor grammar and punctuation is getting old for me. I smiled at your comment.  So funny man.  .05 for you. Sorry, I did not laugh.  Maybe if I was a girly girl I would laugh, but I am a manly man. I appreciated the 3d work.  .01 BTC for you. I did not laugh...sorry. Thanks for this explanation.  Asian jokes tend to play with words. Laughing smirk.  .15 BTC  The frog face did it for me.  :-) I got a smile .05 BTC
I did not even smile.  .01 BTC for trying. Make me laugh.  I like to laugh at some good Chinese humor.  If you write or translate some jokes then I might pay you.  If you send a photo of yourself doing something funny, I might pay you.  I may post what you create on my blog bitcoinblogger.com.  Thank you.Here is what I will pay:If I smile: 0.05 BTCIf I make a laughing smirk (closed mouth): 0.15 BTCIf I laugh out loud (low): 0.35 BTCIf I laugh out loud (medium): 0.50 BTCIf I laugh out loud (maximum): 1.0 BTCIf I roll on the floor laughing: 100 BTCIf you translate a Chinese joke then post it in this thread.  If you think you have a 100 BTC pic you made yourself send it to:bitcoin.cryptocurrency@gmail.comI may decline this offer at any time depending how my mood is for day and how many people have tried to make me laugh.  I have paid out my bounties 100% of the time.  Don't forget to post your bitcoin address along with your submission. I will pay .5 bitcoins if you hold a sign in china next to some historic landmark that says "bitcoins" and send it to me.   Just reduced to 100 BTC. Starting bid is 100BTCYou get the domain name and all the articles I have written.  I can transfer domain via godaddy.  I don't have time to write articles and need someone who has more time to take control of it.  I host it on blogger.com so somehow you have to extract the articles yourself and create a new website and find hosting yourself.  Thank you. Do you mean $600 a year?  Or $600 at one time? davidonpda, how do you "legally" obtain bitcoins to sell?  Just curious.   You know how prime numbers tend to group together?  I wonder if it is truly random... Nefario,How are things going with your experiment???  Please let us know:-) Nefario,This is a great idea.  I know most American universities allow their students to deal with real money.  For instance, most business colleges let students manage million dollar mutual funds.  They make group decisions and buy and sell stocks.  The students don't keep the money but if their fund makes a significant profit then they are pretty much guaranteed jobs on Wallstreet.  I know of a person who found a job like this managing a million dollar international mutual fund and making 20%+ profit.  A lot of investment companies offered him $100K salaries to come work for them.One thing you said bothers me though.  You said you wouldn't care if your students begged, loaned, stole, etc.  The stealing part is definitely a moral concern in American universities.  A student would be expelled from the college if it was found he stole to pass a class.  I would inform your students of not to steal.Other than that great work on a wonderful idea.  I wish more teachers would do this. Chicabowwow Ventures Thanks Mahkul, ribuck, and S3052, and rix for your bitcoin bounties. 100 BTC Sent!    I want to make a music video out of it but my video software expired...doh.  Dunno if I want to pay $100 to get a full copy. Ok, I'll send them tonight when I get home from work. Bitcoin spam would be so easy to do if I could send a message.  I want to try it to give out free coins. What happens if the IP address is not running the bitcoin software? you there tenbagger?  see quote above... EDIT: I can't seem to download the video...how now?Ok, I am using the downloader at ant.com...downloading now.  I'm gonna mix it up and add music to it. Let me know what address to send the bitcoins. ThinkGeek, NewEgg, ... why not target the big ones?  Doesn't hurt.
In American courts a jury decides what is right and wrong.  Right and wrong is based on personal experience.  So, FatherMcGruder is right, in my opinion.MtGox's opinion pretty much represents the opinion of the people on the forums of bitcoin.org. I think mtgox did the right thing.  It's not his job/duty to do so but he went out of his way to fix things.  Swiss banks used to not care too, but now they are holding Egyptian funds. Visa has a market cap of 63 Billion.EBay/Paypal has a market cap of 44 Billion.Citigroup has a market cap of 142 Billion.ETC...So these industries could fall and all of their wealth would be redistributed.  As a whole we would be wealthier. Did I ever tell you that you are my hero? I have updated the appropriate posts with your details. Clive got back to me...here is what he said...Hi [Jimbobway]!Yes, I read it, and my apologies for not getting back to you more quickly.I'm a big fan of alternative currency systems, and bitcoin looks excellent! I don't have any immediate plans to write on alternative digital currencies right now, but it's a subject I'd love to write about at *some* point. I'll keep your email on file for when I get a chance to do so! If it is not, then just carry an extra shirt and shorts. Once complete I will nag whoever owes a bounty to pay up. :-) But if you bought at $.07 and it goes up to $1.4 then the chart is correct.  That's a 20X return!!!  That's more than a 4 Bagger!(If it doubles once it's a one bagger.  Twice is a two bagger, etc.) I don't get it. Here is what I sent.  I borrowed (with permission) some of kiba's letter to the EFF: Dear Clive,You wrote the article on bittorrent in Wired magazine, which I thought was a great article.  I have an idea for another article that will make another outstanding story.  There is a new cryptocurrency called "bitcoin" that uses peer-to-peer technologies and it is growing fast.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) recognizes this electronic currency and accepts bitcoin donations.  It has been on the internet radio "Security Now!", a national radio show at "One Radio Network", and has been written in many, many blogs.The Bitcoin community comprises approximately 5,000 to 10,000 users and over 100 business enterprises employing a new open-source P2P cryptocurrency and monetary system called Bitcoins. The software for bitcoin is published under the MIT license. In addition to many other useful properties, Bitcoin has extremely low transaction fees, high divisibility, and is difficult to produce and counterfeit. These features make Bitcoin useful as a medium of exchange. As such, Bitcoin may become a threat to centralized monetary systems, which are typically backed by governments. The Bitcoin community knows that governments will defend their monetary monopolies, perhaps by suppressing the Bitcoin economy.If you could do a story on this open source software I think many people would be interested.  Please visit the forums at bitcoin.org for additional info.  I can point to you to some reputable sources if needed. Pssst...don't forget to make the bitcoin app a lil more friendly too. I am thinking we contact the guy who wrote this article, http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.01/bittorrent.htmlHis name is Clive Thompson and he can do a story on bitcoin. They have a "Contact Us" page here: http://www.wired.com/about/feedback/One option is "Pitch a story idea" but it says "writers only please".  So I think the best bet is to contact a tech writer, get him/her interested and write the bitcoin story.  Any good writers out there? Anyone up for trying to get Wired.com to do an article on Bitcoin?  They have a good circulation base. I've mentioned before that I believe pizza for bitcoins could be the first bitcoin tangible goods industry that could take off.  Why?  Because of free delivery, food is good, pizza is cheap, and it comes in an hour or so. Good work gavin! Sounds good to me. This is a great publicity stunt!  I like it!  How many bitcoins does one need to survive for one month? *** This bounty expires March 1st 2011 ***
I agree with this.  I started another thread on this earlier too so this must be important. Every newbie, I do mean every newbie, complains about the loading of the blocks on initial download of the bitcoin software.  Can we have some soft of info bubble, popup, or something, anything to let newbies know they need to wait for the blocks to download?  I think it would be very beneficial for newcomers. I disagee.  Up, up, and away! Bitcoin is a P2P technology like Bittorrent.  If companies want to control the currency then Bitcoin is not for them.   It's only a matter of time, I think, that a corporation would create an initiative to copy Bitcoin.  But, I think Bitcoin would remain competitive since it was the first.Here is a question for you.  Has any corporation copied bittorrent? You are more than welcome to take the open source software and create your own network.  With a bit of marketing you can probably make it worth something.  BTW, there is another bitcoin network, the test network, and people (developers) do trade bitcoins but they are worth a lot less. Normally, the first to market wins.  Since bitcoin was first to market it has a very big head start.  An analogy could be that bitcoin is like gold.  And the next currency "x" could be silver. I'd like to see if someone would do it at the NYSE first... How many people watch this show? Everyone go grab a friend, call up an ex, and take them out for a drink!  Time to celebrate!!! http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/02/one-bitcoin-worth-more-than-one-dollar.html This is BIG news and everyone needs to know!  Slashdot, Reddit, Digg, etc...!!!

So you charge the 45 bitcoins primarily for labor costs?  (Approx $35-$40).  I would say your prices are pretty good. Is there support to connect to slush's pooled mining service?  Pre-software install perhaps? Sure ok. But I think the deceleration of inflation better explains why the price of bitcoin will increase even though there is inflation.  The growth in money supply will decrease in half until there will be no more growth.  If I knew there will be less bitcoins minted next year then then I would buy more this year. This is actually not inflation.  It's called disinflation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation How did you come up with 50%?We don't have to expect a big correction a parity.  Could go sky high!
Seems like a Mt. Gox bug. Does anyone here have any experience or know of a way to create a new stock or mutual fund to be traded on the major exchanges?  This stock/mutual fund could represent x bitcoins.  If this stock/fund existed then people who have etrade, ameritrade, or similar accounts could buy bitcoins. Portfolio managers, hedgefund managers, etc. could pour money into bitcoins.I think this could be HUGE... Yes, this is possible. Yes, but what if people don't have the bitcoin client running.  What if they turn it on once a month.  An alert system outside of bitcoin to tell users to turn it on. I was thinking the same...Twitter, Facebook, email.  I don't know know if I am the best person to be in charge of this alert service.  What do you guys think?  I already of a FB page which I can send a alert to in case something happens. I am thinking about starting a Bitcoin Alert service.  If someone hacks the network, we can have an alert service to email or txt everyone to turn on the latest version of the bitcoin client and start generating coins to protect the integrity of the network.  What do you think? Dugg!Digg it up guys! Excellente.  Muy bien. Any way for us to listen to a replay? I doubled...nice! If only they use Bitcoin!http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/19/zynga-rewardville/ I don't mind self-promotion if it is related to bitcoin. Interesting...I had a hard time understanding the concepts...but nevertheless interesting. This map is amazing!  Spreading like wild fire!!! This is great!  The bitcoin community needed one and someone delivered. :-) Bitcoin is the solution to China's problems!  We need to get Bitcoin to China!!! Any moderator want to comment on this thread? If Satoshi farts, would u guys smell it to determine if he is alive?  Sike!!!  this is a great thread because we all want to know what is up with the man with the master plan.  maybe something will budge.
I think Satoshi and the elite bitcoin members have been reclusive because a lot of people bug them and they don't have time to respond to everyone.  In fact, they are probably sick and tired of anything unrelated to the bitcoin client.  They probably trade private emails and we don't know what is going on.I am suggesting a new private topic where only the elite are able to post in.  I don't care if I am not in the elite.  I just want to know what they are talking about instead of having them talk in private.  So all members would have read only access while the elite, chosen by Satoshi or whoever, would be able to read or write to this special forum topic. very nice! When one Bitcoin reaches $1 we need to celebrate...I call it "The Parity Party".  What will you do for your party?We need to be Slashdotted again.  One dollar is off the hook!!!  It's gonna be another wild ride!! One thing that bugs me is that scammers work by stealing other people's paypal username and password.  They could steal the credentials of a member who has a good rating.  This is very hard to stop/detect.  One way a lot of companies do to protect users from this is to have a RSA keyfob. Maybe you can look into this.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecurID I'd be willing to pay $10, but for the flier I'd like to have www.bitcoinblogger.com on it (along with other info).  Also, I don't watch that show so maybe if I could get a youtube vid or screen cap somehow of him on national tv. it's so retarded it just might work. also I stole this idea and it wasn't originally mine.  look up battlecam on youtubesurely someone can think of something even more crazy Maybe.  I was also thinking about a guy getting naked with the words "Bitcoin", "Bitcoin", "Bitcoin" on his chest.  He get's within earshot of the President and yells "Bitcoin!" three times.  I don't think I have enough bitcoins for someone to do this.  It worked for BattleCam. Now you are saying we are attacking you?  By your definition almost anything can now be a personal attack.  To me a personal attack is, "So and so is a moron!  So and so is so stupid and lame!"  This is the Internets and there are more vile things out there than jokes, for instance, bitcoin scam artists.You want me to respect someone who is advertising a Ponzi scheme?  Yes, he is new here but respect is earned, not automatically given.  I respect that he is a forum user, but not the fact that he is trying to mislead people with a scam.  And I respect you too but I just don't know if we have the same sense of humor. Nice. It is not a personal attack.  It attacks the idea, not the person and therefore is not personal.  I am just glad I got some laughs out of this and brightened some people's day.  The world is dreary as it is.  Speaking of humor have you seen the Bitcoin protester?http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/01/power-of-bitcoins.html Nothing wrong with a little sarcasm to tell the truth.  Look at how CNN, MSNBC, etc. has failed to counter FOX News while 'The Daily Show With Jon Stewart' is the only show capable of countering Fox's exaggeration with their own humorous slant.  Quite effective IMOP.  The Internet is full of wrong info and one just need some good B.S. filters.  You are probably an older guy but a lot of kids and teenagers  would fall for this Ponzi stuff.  I fell for one once when I was a teenager. Ok, I suppose what I thought was a negative could be a positive. Right now there is one major cooperative miner.  He has about 9000 Gh/s.  Does this means he controls a lot of the network?  What if he hacks the bitcoin client?  Couldn't this be a potential problem?  Or, do everyone who contribute to the cooperative server help the integrity of the bitcoin? creighto, could you please pay him your bounty?  thx!!! Here are the pics:  http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/01/power-of-bitcoins.htmlGreat work sir!  Your bitcoins (42 from me) are on the way!!!  Great outfit!   This is so old.  I am involved with the a type of marketing called the Pentagon and it is waaaay better than your Trapezoid.  Don't listen to him and listen to me.  I will send you details of the Pentagon Multi Level Marekting if you PM me!Next year I plan to come out with the Hexagon Multi Level Marketing.  You see, it is time based and when one gets old a new type of marketing must come out!  Send some bitcoins to me and I will tell you how it's done.  Don't do the Trapezoid, do the Pentagon and soon to be Hexagon. This sounds amazing! It's also first come-first served.  First person to have a nice pic will get the bounty.   Nice thx! A video would be great too though not required.
Crazy outfit is subjective.  I will pay 0 to 10 extra bitcoins depending on the outfit. If you wear a crazy outfit it would be stupendous. See the pics here: http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/01/power-of-bitcoins.htmlHold the sign "Stop the FED! Use Bitcoins!!!" in big large words near an intersection with busy people.  Take a nice pic. Send it to me and only to me so I can post it on bitcoinblogger.com.  I will give you 32 bitcoins.  Willing to take suggestions for sign text.It's also first come-first served.  First person to have a nice pic will get the bounty.   Video is nice but not required.  You must also have fun.    If you wear a crazy outfit I will send you 0 to 10 extra bitcoins.Send pic to my email:  bitcoin.cryptocurrency  AT  gmail.com Is this serious?  First bitcoin prostitute/pimp? How much are you willing to spend?  You should look into pooled mining.  http://mining.bitcoin.cz/The best way to obtain bitcoins, in my opinion, is to buy them. I've been thinking about this a lot.  I if I was a scammer I would register a user1.  Using that user1 name I would invite another user2 (which would be fake).  I would use user2 to invite user3 (another fake account).  Then use user3 to invite fake user4 and so on.So my point is this...if you catch scammer user4 then you have to ban the entire tree of users down to user1.  So anyone underneath user4 would be banned including user1, user2, user3, and user4.  I think this is the safest way to allow PayPal.  Can you do this? Thanks for the offer...maybe the next vid. Thx for the input!  More videos to come...if I have time!  To everyone: Share the video! http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2011/01/bitcoin-rise-of-new-currency.htmlDirect youtube link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Sj6_pd6j0 Looks like its making its rounds in Asia: http://tech.qq.com/a/20101230/000399.htm i wouldn't mind spam if i got paid for it. You could set up an email service, "PayMeToSendMeEmail.com".  So if someone wants to contact you they have to send x bitcoins. yea the website is ok. but my work is the flash killer app. I am thinking we should do a celebration of some sort when bitcoin reaches $1.  News blitz, ad banners, go out to get drinks, etc.  Our hard work paying off! Here is an example of my work, currently in beta.  Uses GWT.http://www.bluedojo.com What about GWT?  I have advanced GUI GWT skillz. Yes, if you trust yourself, which obviously we most likely do, and have a really good reputation where users trust the giver, then this would work.  I guess it all boils down to trust. My idea kind of resembles a gift card.  A gift card has a credit card number which the giver can write down.  He doesn't though, so he gives it to gift card receiver who is free to use that gift card.  In this case there is a lot of trust.On a similar note watch out for gift card scams where people go to the store, write down the gift card number, and wait for it to be loaded.  They will check for loaded gift cards, and once they contain money they will spend it! I would delete this thread if I could. Doh!  My idea is screwed.
Right now making payments via Bitcoins is not instant since you have to wait for confirmations which could take 10 or more minutes.  You have to use a third party to transfer bitcoins, such as mybitcoins.com.So I have an idea to transfer bitcoins instantly using the current system without using a third party.First the bitcoin app needs to be able to support multiple wallets.  If I want to instantly send bitcoins to another user, I create wallets containing coins in certain denominations.  For instance, I have a pre-made wallet with 1 coin in it.  If I want to pay someone, I send him my ENTIRE wallet.This way I can go to anyone with a phone or a store and pay him instantly by handing the wallet without waiting for confirmations.Summary: Ability to have multiple wallets and ease of use.  What do you guys think?  Maybe we can explore this idea? Cool. I wonder if the mining pool has anything to do with this.  Maybe it made so big miners go low on business. I got my bitcoins from him. Jeffery Paul is giving a presentation mostly on Bitcoin in Berlinhttp://sneak.datavibe.net/20101222/financing-the-revolution/If anyone is going please give us an update on this or an audio. The Bitcoin Borg Hive - Resistance is futile. Hehe, ok.  Just to let you know on your front page it saysPooledMiningServerhttp://mining.bitcoin.cz/and the PMS letter is highlighted.  I recommend you change PMS (Pooled Mining Server) to some other acronym.  PMS is also a popular term for Premenstrual Syndrome used all the time in U.S. popular culture. A can't remember what it's called but when I read the contract it sounded threatening.  The thought of doing it for free has crossed my mind.  Shrug.  Kinda busy though. Right now I am programming web based virtual worlds for a living, but I signed an NDA so I don't think I can program a web game without losing my job if they found out. What ever happened to all the talk of using microtransactions for games, using bitcoins as a virtual currency?  All we need is one social hit game "Bitcoinville" (like Farmville) and Bitcoin will fly like a G6.  Farmville made millions of dollars with people buying it's virtual currency. You guys might think I am crazy but I think Pizza4Bitcoins.com could be an industry identifier for tangible items if done correctly.  Why?  Well for several reasons. 1.) People aren't willing to spend a lot of their Bitcoins they have saved or generated.  Pizza requires more than a micropayment, but it's not too bad of a price range of around $15.2.) Right now it is hard to buy small tangible items with Bitcoins online.  If you buy a candy bar online it's $1.00 plus shipping of $5 so it is not worth it as a business model.  With Pizza4Bitcoins, shipping is almost free.  It's almost free because Pizza Hut automatically includes the delivery charge with the order already.  3.)  People like to eat pizza.I guess the core of my argument is free shipping for food that comes within 1 hour of ordering online using Bitcoins.  Yummy! I am not sure if I agree with this 100%.  Most successful marketing campaigns rely on successful salesmanship and marketing.  It's possible that Bitcoin could be analogous to a "sleeper hit movie" where little or no marketing is required, but those kind of movies are rare (Forrest Gump).  I'd rather do some marketing to increase the chances of Bitcoin becoming adopted.  What I don't want to do is over-promise something and under-deliver.  So, I guess the promises need to be "just right". I agree that Wei Dai does not have time.  He is a busy guy since I've tried contacting him last month. Bitcoin as a type of investment.  So the investment business.  Maybe as a tool for diversifying your portfolio.  Kind of like how websites sell gold as an investment, a collectible.Baseball cards are collectibles based on demand and a limited supply too.   Why not bitcoins? nice work slush, i just joined.  seems to be working... Ok, I misunderstood. You are right.  Mt.Gox volume seems has been low since they started dark pools.  Who knows what is going on behind the scenes. Mt Gox says the volume is about 2000 bitcoins.  But bitcoinwatch says 115000 was sent the past 24 hrs.  I wonder if this is a result of dark pools. Is it safe to say Satoshi's paper is based on the work of world reknown cryptologists?  For instance in Satoshi's paper he references Wei Dai who basically wrote the C++ Crypto library. Thinking outside the box here:Moon, Mars land registrations using bitcoin.In general digital lotteries using bitcoin.Obviously, patents and copyright.As a side note I don't like the arrogant attitudes of some of the posts in this thread.  Some people here talk like everything they say is fact.  As far as I know you are just an Internet user to me unless you have earned your respect like Satoshi.  Maybe they talk like that to get attention.  Not going to mention any names. I am hoping the developers implement Satoshi's ideas which are:1.) Different chains but same CPU pool.2.) When solving a block give 50 BT and domain name.I especially don't want a fork so my Bitcoins are worth something.
Quoting from the link you provided...So what I am looking for are special properties of bitcoin that we (men) can use to add value to it, that can augment to it's historical value. One of the major disadvantages of bitcoin at this point in time is that it serves no purpose other than a currency.  In essense, it is like fiat currency; it is only worth what people think it is worth.  100% of the price increase of Bitcoin is based on money put in by investors.  If Bitcoin had another purpose the price of Bitcoin would be based not only on money put in by investors but the additional demand caused by that purpose. I am starting this new post from another thread because I think it needs further discussion.Right now gold can be mined and used as a currency.  You can also use gold to make jewelry, build circuit boards, etc., because it has special properties.  Therefore, gold has more than one purpose which increases its value.  As of now most people believe that bitcoin can only be used as a currency.  If people start using bitcoins to timestamp their work, then every bitcoin actually has more intrinsic value because it has more than one purpose!  A bitcoin is actually not only useful as a currency but it has the ability to timestamp.  If someone could use this special bitcoin property similarly to how scientists used the conductive properties of gold, then bitcoins could takeoff in a different tangent which could further increase its value.  Is there a breakthough application waiting to be discovered using the timestamp property out there???Please brainstorm how to use bitcoins in new ways and post your ideas here.   Concerning using bitcoins as timestamps...Right now gold can be mined and used as a currency.  You can also you gold to make jewelry, build circuit boards, etc., because it has special properties.  Therefore, gold has more than one purpose which increases its value.  As of now most people believe that bitcoin can only be used as a currency.  If people start using bitcoins to timestamp their work, then every bitcoin actually has more intrinsic value because it has more than one purpose!  A bitcoin is actually not only useful as a currency but it has the ability to timestamp.  If someone could use this special bitcoin property similarly to how scientists used the conductive properties of gold, then bitcoins could takeoff in a different tangent which could further increase its value.  Is there a breakthough application waiting to be discovered using the timestamp property out there??? I wonder if dark pools is a good thing for bitcoin... Awesome...bitcoin on a roll! I archived my wallet to be opened 16 years from now.  Will I run into a similar problem? Way to go on making an effort. brucewager, u r my hero.  great job! Sorry if this is a repeat but is there an equivalent type of concept as a dark pool in other exchange sites like etrade?  I don't know if I like dark pools... My feeling is you are getting a lot if russians who may be attempting to hack your site. I think implementing pooled mining in the main client is necessary for bitcoin's future.  Right now less and less people are not generating because of GPU domination where a handful of users are controlling the network.  Pooled mining will also give newbies a chance to generate.  The more people that are interested the more valuable and important bitcoin is. Ummm this thread is supposed to be about solving a scam, not starting new ones. Also, how is the bandwidth, CPU usage going?  How many clients can it support? Ok, maybe this weekend, but we need to make it as easy as possible to run this.  Maybe have a GUI to enter in the bitcoin address or any other info. How often will this be updated?  Can I write a bitcoinblogger article on this? You might be able to declare bankruptcy, but you won't be able to rent or buy ever again, I don't think. My economics professor in college said a good economy is when the amount of money spent equals the amount of money saved.  For example, if I made $100 a week then I should spend $50 and save $50.Also, right now bitcoin is not very liquid.  If it was more people would be spending. There must be an incentive for small miners to hash.  At the rate we are going only the top miners will continue to mine and it is possible there could only be one left.  If we reach that point the network will be controlled by that big boy miner. IMHO, most if not all bitcoin sites stink.  bitcoin.org is the best.  Every other site needs work including mine.
Any one from SoCal?  Maybe we can do a meetup too.Speaking of local currencies check this out:  http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2009-04-05-scrip_N.htm Most of it come from reddit.  Thx to whoever put it there.  Just to let you guys know I really don't make money or bitcoins off of this.  I just do it for fun and because I believe in bitcoin.I've made about 95 bitcoins from donations and $1 of off Google Ads.  The domain cost $9 and writing articles takes time. A movie of this caliber would do bitcoin a very good service:Check out the quality of this explanation of 'groupon'http://vimeo.com/2112924 No, I just googled 'omegadraconis'.  Not sure if that's the 'omegadraconis' we are looking for, but the guy does look technical.  Sorry if I made this a witchhunt.   Right now people are relying on reputation.  But if you have no reputation you could use the escrow service.  Escrow service could make some money off of each trade. Ok, if there was little or no charge back risk it would be great.  How many bitcoins do u have for sale? Bitcoin Block Explorer now easily allows the possibility of an escrow service.  The escrow service can see who is paying who.  Win.  Any takers? What about gift/prepaid credit cards?  Is there any way to use these in case people want anonymity? Have you considered text message code that is sent to a phone?  It would be another step for security... Hmmm???http://www.flickr.com/photos/jhensler/ Just FYI...thx everyone for making this happen!   Are we ever going to add GPU mining into the main code base?  Most mining is done by GPUs now and they could have outdated/modified code which could threaten the block chain. Using bitcoind server it's possible to send decimals under .01 right?  I think the default bitcoin client should by default show .01 but it should be adjustable in the menu. I am obviously voting for mine #3 with the girls.  Do I get bonus points for using cute anime girls or do I not?  Maybe some sort of secondary prize?  Prob not fair to award me bonus points anyway. Thx for your constructive criticism.  As you may know, I am "pro" bitcoin and my articles tend to lean to promoting bitcoin.  I chose to add those paragraphs because I think the reader deserves to know the whole truth.  For example, the latest scandals involving buybitcoins.com, mtgox.com, and bitcoinmarket.com were a major setback to the bitcoin movement.  I think it is clear that bitcoin will face some legal battles as more people are aware of it.  I think my journalistic side is trying to cover both sides of the story, but by the end of the article I hope I give the impression that the future of bitcoin is in good hands.  I think I am more of a blogger than a journalist so I guess I have some flexibility on how I portray stories.  But, thx for your criticism and I will keep what you say in mind. LOL!  Very funny!!!   Maybe we can look at it at a different point of view.  Maybe $2.10 is not expensive and bitcoin is worth a lot more.  davidonpda calculated that using the AWS GPU cluster it would cost $150 per block.  That means it would cost $3 to generate one bitcoin at this point in time.  Therefore a bitcoin is worth $3.If Amazon charges $2.1/hr then I would guess that this price is close to the "industry standard" in terms of cost for the hardware, hosting, electricity, etc., to be a profitable cloud computing company.  That means today's bitcoin prices on the market are really cheap!   $150 for a block means, by cloud computing industry standards, is $3 a bitcoin!  $150/50 = $3.  Is this the true worth of a bitcoin?!? Yes, thx kiba for starting this! Awesome.
This is great!  Thanks for posting that pic! You are welcome to you own opinions. :-). I just see this matter resembling the recent Citizens United case where the supreme court ruled that it was legal for corporations to fund political orgs anonymously.  The EFF accepting bitcoin donations is not a supreme court ruling but it is more of the principle of accepting anonymous bitcoin donations.  The EFF at the moment appears to be on Bitcoin's side and hopefully the association/relationship continues to grow.     Ok, I sensed this was coming and should have known.  I changed the title in the blog. I removed the bitcoin addy altogether.  No biggie for me. Bitcoin Blogger: http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/11/bitcoin-gains-legal-protection-through.html Bitcoin Blogger Article http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/11/bitcoin-gains-legal-protection-through.html very nice!   This reminds me of the movie Swordfish with John Travolta where he hacked 256-bit encryption with ease.  At the end of the movie he hacked 1024-bit encryption, I think.  LOL! Well, it takes some time for the bitcoins to confirm.  Maybe do an instant payment via Mt. Gox or mybitcoin.com and it would be instant. No, not yet.  Margin trading makes it very volatile.  Maybe when the bitcoin is more stable. It's the buyer to determine whether his business is private or not. So you're not going to tell us what you will do with the bitcoins? ummm, hope you don't mind me asking but what do you plan to do with 300K bt  Many, many people have bought 10,000 BT on Mt. Gox.  This is not a big deal for me or for those who've been able to buy and get their bitcoins on Mt. Gox.  Either you trust Mt. Gox, bitcoinmarket, individual users etc. or you don't.  I think it is more a matter of trust than the fact that the bitcoins are "backed".  I supposed "backed" bitcoins could earn more trust, but I think trust is built over time.  Although Valerius may have a somewhat of a good point he just seems to be on the verge of paranoia on this matter. I don't understand him either.  I don't LR should be the standard to claim Bitcoins is 'backed'.  He didn't answer my question about bitcoinmarket.com which is peer-to-peer and direct payments are made. Please explain how you want Mt. Gox to "show you the money".  Would bitcoinmarket.com peer-to-peer method to buy bitcoins satisfy your requirement?   What's important about Mt. Gox's "hot air backed numbers" is the volume.  The volume is above 41,000 today so you could buy 10,000 bitcoins at approximately Mt. Gox's advertised price.  Remember, you can always set a limit order and not a market order.  If you were buying above volume then you have a point, but since you are only buying 10,000 then it's not a major issue. "Tianhe-1A was designed by the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) in China, and it is already fully operational. To achieve the new performance record, Tianhe-1A uses 7,168 Nvidia Tesla M2050 GPUs and 14,336 Intel Xeon CPUs. It cost $88 million; its 103 cabinets weigh 155 tons, and the entire system consumes 4.04 megawatts of electricity."http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2010/10/supercomputer_in_china_super_f.htmlUmmm, what do you think??? Guaranteed monopoly? I deposited usd into mt gox with paypal.  So if Mt Gox's PayPal was not frozen I should be able to withdraw my money back directly into my PayPal account.r u hoping that mt gox not get a second paypal account just so the first paypal acct has a likely chance to bcome unfrozen? I'm ok with that too. but once unfrozen I should b able 2 make usd withdraws into my pp acct.  I do not want 2 go through liberty reserve.
mtgox, can u offer withdraws via paypal?  withdraws won't have chargebacks.  if no, then why not? I noticed too. It's very exciting.  We on our way to reach quarter (25 cents) parity. Yes that is what I did.  I have two wallets.  One is essentially a "savings" account which is encrypted which I don't plan to spend, only receive.  The other is the wallet which I consider the "checking" account.  The checking account has less bitcoins in it and is not encrypted. I have learned to pick who you can trust carefully when buying bitcoins.However, I don't trust anyone holding onto my bitcoins.  Someone could get to the server, the house could burn down, who knows.  I have used TrueCrypt and have three copies of my wallet, all encrypted.  I put them on two USB sticks and plan to hide them in different places for the long term too. Go to the AVG Virus Vault to see what AVG has detected. dhaw, what kind of antivirus or spyware are you running? I have received my full amount of bought bitcoins from bitcoin2cash.  Looking forward to the next sale! How does the keypool feature work and why is it safer? 1 dollar Mt. Gox is in a great position to do many needed services.  I hope the grand vision is recognized and implemented.  It will not only help the bitcoin community, but it could also help Mt. Gox if he decides to monetize. Log in and click on ur username. Click in Payment API  Right that is even better. :-)Maybe bitcoin4cash could completely integrate with Mt Gox so there aren't two middle mans.  Less confusing for newbies. It looks like Mt Gox has an API for Mt Gox users to send bitcoins directly to other Mt Gox users.  So if it was ok with bitcoin4cash, then we could send cash to him and he could add bitcoins to a specific Mt Gox account.As for withdraws it would just work in the opposite direction and bitcoin4cash would mail cash to the user. Good point on the withdraws.  I'd like to see Mt. Gox set up withdraws on PayPal if possible since there would never be any charge backs.  Well, Mt. Gox? It would be a start...it's good to have more than one way to fund an account in case something awful happens. Since Mt. Gox is trying to find a way to handle cash transactions, maybe he could work with Bitcoin4Cash (or Bitcoin2Cash) to handle cash.  Then for users who'd like to get or send cash via mail it would work out for everyone.Just an idea. I have finally received my bitcoins from bitcoin2cash.  Thx!!!     I think it's a good idea but how can we gauge a level of commitment?  It's easy to say "yes, I'll do it" but it there were an incentive for the leaders besides honor and respect, it would encourage more activity, imho.  right now people do this because it's 'fun'.  if it starts to feel like work then people want more, like getting paid with bitcoins.  if there was a way to compensate these chosen leaders...then... Yes!  I'm already registered and grandfathered in!  The rules don't apply to me! :-)  Thx. This is awesome, I hope to become a zombie to a botnet server soon (since I don't think I have the hardware and bandwidth to support a super server).
It's ok.  I'm sure something awesome will come out, but I'm happy to test this for momchil.  thought my 8800 would have OpenCL support but it doesn't.  Thanks anyway. ok , i have no opencl support (see image)             This could be a solution to working offshore.http://ecoble.com/2007/11/18/250000-bottles-amazing-recycled-mexican-island-paradise/ I went home for lunch and I am physically at my computer...back to work for me.  I have not tried puddinpop's client.

I think any postal service would have some sort of danger to it, but maybe USPS has the highest percentage of lost mail.  It is dangerous to mail cash because the chance of misdirection, theft, etc.  There is a chance you could lose your money.  If I didn't put a return address on it my cash could be anywhere by now. Confused!    http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/10/dangers-of-mailing-cash.html I made a bitcoinblogger post about this... http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/10/dangers-of-mailing-cash.html
I actually did write "Bitcoin2Cash, LLC" on the envelope.       Well, looks like I am not going to get my bitcoins.  The letter I sent to bitcoin2cash arrived in my mailbox!!!    On the envelope it says "Not deliverable as addressed.  Unable to forward."I double checked and triple checked the address and it is the same as on the website.  Handwriting is very, very legible.PO Box 6946Huntsville, AL 35813-0946Is this a glitch in the Post Office?  Strange...just to let you guys know I used to work for the post office so this is an anomaly.  I just wasted my forever stamp.Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.........Update: On the envelope the post office printed the zipcode+4 on it.  The zipcode is correct.  Very puzzling... Thx for the response. Hey Satoshi,What is your favorite food? No bitcoins from bitcoin2cash yet...getting a lil nervous... I'm still waiting for my bitcoins from bitcoin2cash.  Hopefully this week... I sent some money via snailmail.  Will report to this thread if I do or do not get bitcoins in the next week or two. There is no public link to the original publications that I am aware of.I can't answer your question 100% since I don't know wikipedia's policies. http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/09/bitcoin-electronic-currency-future-of.html       Good point, but I can understand why a banker would want to talk to the creator of a project.  I could think of a few good reasons... I am bitcoinblogger.com.  Just send me a PM.  Thx. 2 confirmations take a min or two min. the more confirmations the better. Can you just create a new windows user and log in with that user?  Bitcoin creates a directory per windows user, I think. How did u generate that list? Ok, when I have a little time I'm gonna try and put a spreadsheet together. Perhaps, but maybe a necessary evil?  Did u know the founder of bitcoin used porn as the first files to download to promote his software?  "A necessary evil" he said... I have an idea but it would be awesome if I got donations for it.   I think the gambling industry could use bitcoins because right now it is a super pain to deposit money into gambling sites due to U.S. federal regulations.  It is very difficult to deposit via Mastercard or Visa since most banks won't process it.  So to counter this the gambling industry has setup backdoor payment systems such as NetTeller, Bank Wire, Click2Pay, eWalletXpress, MyPayLinkQ, shady banks, etc to get users to easily deposit money.  My proposal is this:  I (or someone in this forum) will contact all major gambling and sports betting sites, such as Bodog.com, sportfanatik.com, betonsports.com, etc. via email, snail mail, and eventually phone call to work with them to use bitcoins.  We need one project lead in this, and the help of forum members just in case they have questions.  I could be this lead.I will set up a spreadsheet with all the companies to show which have been contacted and which are interested.What do you guys think? Just emailed http://www.apmex.com to see if they could start trading bitcoins.I think the key is to get the big players involved.  Imagine if PayPal started to accept bitcoins.  It's game over for other currencies. Hi joey,Looks like you are back after a very long hiatus.  Just to let you know you really need to improve upon your customer service if you want your site to succeed.Jim The 24-core beast will draw a minimum of 380W (using the power supply calculator: http://educations.newegg.com/tool/psucalc/index.html)
Heh.  I did write the article.  But what do I know?   I can't wait for someone to write an application that allows group mining of bitcoins.  I just can't wait one month to see 50 bitcoins. http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/08/is-it-better-to-buy-or-generate.html Nice website!  I'll add it to my blog bitcoinblogger.com I admit I didn't know what I was talking about.  Just trying to understand what you are doing. A few rhetorical questions for satoshi:Can you resist waterboarding?Can you endure electric shock?All forms of torture?Lastly, are you Jack Bauer by any chance?   Seriously. http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/08/click-on-graph-to-see-larger-image.html I have asked bitcoinmarket.com to write an RSS feed so I am able to add it to my blog http://www.bitcoinblogger.com.  He has one but it is using https and not http so I can't add to my blog. I would be interested.  Satoshi definitely needs to be there if it were to gather interest. Any way we can add www.bitcoinblogger.com to the list of bitcoin sites?  I accept bitcoin donations for the moment for bitcoin journalism.  Thx. Check it outhttp://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/08/bitcoin-exchange-review-my-experience.html It's all about the show.  Cubic zirconia vs diamonds viewing at arm's distance?  Same analogy. I can take an iPhone, write a bling-bling application that will show how many bitcoins I own.  I can then tie the iPhone to a rope necklace, wear it, and show off how many bitcoins I have.  Holla!  Jewelry of the future, baby! I believe bitcoins will be better than gold!!!  Wahoo!!! From "the man with the master plan" himself: I decided to promote this into a new thread.  http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/08/how-to-make-bitcoins-tutorial.html Don't know if I'll earn any bitcoins but here is a movie.  Enjoy!http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/08/how-to-make-bitcoins-tutorial.html But can you artificially disrupt it?  For instance, in the case of Zimbabwe they re-denominated their currency which is 'artificial'.  I don't think this can be done with bitcoin. Sooooo,  I decided to start a blog...I hope no one minds my self promotion. :-)http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/Intriguing: Disruptive Technology To Upend All BanksFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThe latest word on the Internet is the "bitcoin", a new type of crypto-currency that has the potential to upend all banking systems around the world. What exactly is a bitcoin? According to its main website, bitcoin.org, it is a new type of currency based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, which means that there is no central authority to regulate it. Unlike the U.S. dollar, which is mostly regulated by federal banks, the P2P currency cannot be affected by the monetary policy of any government. It is impossible, by logical and mathematical design, that the price of the bitcoin could be artificially manipulated by human intervention. This mere fact gives bitcoin the potential to disrupt the entire banking industry.Many governments of different countries have had a role in manipulating their currency in an attempt to remain competitive. The United States, China, Zimbabwe, etc., have all influenced their respective monetary policies by using currency manipulation techniques. The U.S. Federal Reserve System (informally known as the "Fed") raises and lowers interests rates to spur or slow the economy. The Chinese have kept the value of the yuan artificially weak to boost Chinese exports. In addition, the country of Zimbabwe suffered massive hyperinflation by re-denominating and printing new currency. According to the Cato Institute the highest monthly inflation rate for Zimbabwe was a ghastly 79,600,000,000%!Suppose governments were not able to manipulate currency and everyone had a level playing field. The world could be more fair and economies would be based purely on supply and demand. Bitcoin offers this type of fairness. Since the recent Great Recession superpower countries have proposed instituting a global currency to replace all currencies. For example, one proposal was to take the top currencies and to find the average value. This is a somewhat good idea but the reality is that the politics required to implement such a concept is insurmountable. Instead, many bitcoin proponents would say that crypto-currency is the best idea, since it is based on a grass-roots approach instead of a top-down solution.It is a grass-roots approach because anyone with a computer and Internet connection can download the bitcoin software at www.bitcoin.org. Transactions are peer-to-peer so payments are made directly from one user to another. No middle man or bank is required. Thus, there are no merchant fees or transaction costs whatsoever. Clearly bitcoin is a different type of currency with traits that resembles the monetary characteristics of gold.Anytime any country's currency goes head-to-head with the U.S. dollar then that country gains respect. Bitcoin is growing in value and whenever bitcoin reaches parity with the U.S. dollar it will surely be a force to be reckon with. New bitcoin economies will rise and old banking companies must adapt or fail.If you found this article helpful please donate to the author at this bitcoin address: 1J3zMWdVppQ6nhmxvGoEqMZFUKyZhfbNb8bitcoinblogger.com in most casinos there is a printer in all the slot machines that print out what money you have left. there is a barcode on the piece of paper where u can put it into another slot machine or go to a casino teller and exchange it for cash. so I think such a concept is feasible since casinos already somewhat have such a system.
I guess I doing some self promotion   , but I decided I am going to start a bitcoinblog.  You can read it here...http://bitcoinblogger.blogspot.com/We'll see how long it lasts...   Wow!  Thx for the bitcoins...it gives me an incentive to write more... :-) Right, ok.  I think the key to getting the word out is to have a lot of press releases with lots of focus points.  I'll try to come up with something more general. Thanks for the advice...more press releases to come.  I wanted to focus on one topic to get people excited, but will talk about other things if I have time. Another link...http://www.free-press-release.com/news-bitcoins-a-new-digital-gold-rush-1281123935.html Here is a free press release.  I am adding a link here so Google will find it.http://www.prlog.org/10842756-bitcoins-new-digital-gold-rush.html I just wrote this as a press release and submitted it.  I can write more if there is enough interest...Bitcoins: A New Digital Gold RushThe California Gold Rush began in 1848 when gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill.  Hundreds of thousands of people migrated across the country to prospect for the rare yellow metal.  Mining for gold was a challenging task and there were tools that were invented to separate gold from dirt.  If a prospector could sift through more dirt he or she could find more gold and generate more money.  The prospectors used tools such as picks, shovels, pans, dry washers, riffle boards, sluice boxes, etc. that would attempt to filter dirt in high volume so more nuggets could be found.  Similarly, there is a new type of digital gold  that is mined on the Internet today and it is called a "bitcoin".  The concept of a bitcoin is very similar to the concept of gold.  For instance, mining for gold requires manual labor and time.  Comparatively, mining for bitcoins requires computational labor to generate credits.  Thousands of users on the Internet are now mining for bitcoins in hopes of fortune.  Many are trying to develop software and hardware tools to mine for bitcoins more efficiently in hopes of becoming filthy rich.The first bitcoin rush was not started at a mill, but instead started with a Slashdot posting.  Slashdot is a technology news website that has millions of visitors.  When bitcoin was started by its creator, Satochi Nakamoto, a single bitcoin had practically no value.  When bitcoin was featured on the front page of Slashdot the price of a bitcoin multiplied by eight times.  Today the value of the bitcoin is accelerating faster than any other currency on the planet.  As more users delve into the bitcoin economy the value continues to rise and demand increases.  Savvy users are trying to mine for bitcoins at a faster rate by setting up server farms to perform intense number crunching calculations.  To generate more bitcoins programmers are optimizing code to fully utilize their computer's CPU, while some are even attempting to calculate bitcoins by using high-end graphic cards.The key to producing bitcoins in volume is computational speed.  As of this article's writing a quad-core Intel 2.0 Ghz processor can produce 50 bitcoins in about three days.  Reportedly in online forums there are users who run 48-core machines that is capable of generating 50 bitcoins in 6 hours or less.  Others have claimed to run server farms with 300+ machines burning CPU cycles 24/7.Like the wild, wild west in the 1800s, there are dangers when working with bitcoin in the world wide web.  Bitcoin owners need to safeguard their wealth from viruses, hackers, and scammers.  Bitcoins are stored on a user's computer so if a hacker could get access to that machine he or she could steal that user's  bitcoins.  More recently, the world's first bitcoin scam was able to trick users in giving away bitcoins for non-existent software.  Most of these scam issues, however, exist with other currencies and can be avoided with a little common sense.The bitcoin economy is growing steadily as more users understand and accept the system.  New web services, currency exchanges, and markets are being created daily which allows easier trading of goods and services.  If bitcoin continues to grow in acceptance one can dream that it can someday become the new gold standard.  If you would like to learn more about bitcoin go to www.bitcoin.org.In the spirit of bitcoin if you enjoyed this article then please donate to this bitcoin address: 15rMp3uAk1WJdupueHhvM6895uZv9JJW8C I am interested in doing this movie but there are others that might be interested too.  Will this be a competition?  If so how will the bitcoins be distributed?  Thx. Right.What I was trying to say was I can start my own bitcoin network and start my own chain there. (Kind of like how the test network is separate from production.)  If bitcoin.com expired and someone grabbed it then it could have some repercussions.  They could claim the brand new network was the real network.  Far fetched?  I guessed maybe I might be being a lil nitpicky. Agreed on same shared protocol and perhaps wallet.  What I don't want happening is someone starts their own chain.  Nothing stopping anyone from doing this, but the longer the chain the stronger the concept of bitcoin, right? Since satoshi is the founder, I am suggesting that he create a roadmap of what he plans to do.  Right now all I know is the client and only the client but I don't know of satoshi has bigger, grander plans.  If he could supply us with his vision and what he wants to do with bitcoin it would be great.What I would hate seeing is if bitcoin has multiple flavors, like Linux has multiple flavors (which is arguable).  Too many flavors and too many branches could weaken the concept of bitcoin, not to mention devalue my bitcoins I already own.I think the domain, bitcoin.org, could be important because of name branding and also because it could serve as a central authority on the status and future of bitcoin. Suppose, god forbid, you were no longer able to program or were unavailable due to unknown circumstances.  Do you have a procedure in mind to continue bitcoin in your absence? Sorry to be so skeptical, but there was a victim on this site when someone claimed to have compiled a CUDA client that used the graphics processor to hash.  One guy fell for it and lost some bitcoins.But yes, if I get a chance I will look at the dlls I suppose before running it.Or, maybe you can release the project files and we can compile it ourselves? How do we know this is not a scam?  Give us your IP to donate with or something so we can make sure you are reputable.  I am scared to install it, it might steal my bitcoins. Seems like the guy deleted his profile on the msg board.  Here is what Google cache says:Summary - CodexTheSloth   Picture/TextName:   CodexTheSlothPosts:   2 (N/A per day)Position:   NewbieDate Registered:   Today at 08:00 amLast Active:   Today at 09:33 amICQ:   AIM:   MSN:   YIM:   Email:   hiddenWebsite:   Current Status:    OfflineGender:   Age:   N/ALocation:   Local Time:   July 17, 2010, 09:48 amLanguage:   Signature: RHorning,I think you have a really, really good idea.  Right now you need your wallet file to do any type of transaction.  But, what if the wallet was stored in the P2P network and password protected (very strong!).  That means you don't have to carry your wallet anywhere, and you could log into any terminal to buy goods with bitcoins.  There would be tremendous advantages to this. Don't buy from buybitcoins.com.  I made a credit card transaction for 4 coins last week or so but never got any payments.  I tried to contact the owner but he disappeared.  I posted some messages in the forum and sent him a private message but no word!  I would stay away.  I hope my credit card doesn't get compromised. I am really scared to lose my wallet due to an install, re-install, or backing up.  In another thread a user backed up his wallet only to lose all of his bitcoins, forever.See this thread: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=359.0Maybe we can have a step-by-step procedure to successfully backup and to restore. When you copied the copy of wallet.dat back to the Bitcoin AppData folder, did you overwrite the existing wallet.dat?This is certainly REALLY SCARY since that's how people do backups.  What is the procedure to do backup and restoring backups??? Is it possible to rewrite portions of bitcoin so it runs entirely in GAE?  Particularly the feature that handles transactions, so it is fully scalable?I am thinking one can get the sourcecode from SourceForge and write the C code into GAE language (Python or Java).
