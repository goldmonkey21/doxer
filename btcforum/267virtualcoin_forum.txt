I'm not sure, but I think it's unusual to jump from version 0.3 to 1.3. ^^ Maybe 1.0?But on the other hand: who cares? But look here:32-bit Linux version on Ubuntu 10.044 cores: 2500 khash/s3 cores: 1900 khash/s2 cores: 1260 khash/s1 core: 630 khash/s64-bit Linux version on Ubuntu 10.04 (new measure)4 cores: 2880 khash/s3 cores: 2150 khash/s2 cores: 1450 khash/s1 core: 720 khash/s(Though I never created one coin, yet - but I don't let bitcoin run on 4 cores the whole day, not even on 1 core...)@Joozero - The Intel i7 860 is @ 2.8 Ghz, isn't it? My Phenom II is @ 3 Ghz, that's another important fact I think. I will try bitcoin on Windows 7 at the same machine later./edit32-bit Win version on Windows 7 64-bit4 cores: 2310 khash/s3 cores: 1740 khash/s2 cores: 1160 khash/s1 core: 580 khash/s Gavin, why don't you just block all served Bitcoin addresses?Would it be easy to generate them automatically? Nice. :-)64-bit version works fine on Ubuntu 10.04, of course it's (much) faster than through WINE emulation (and because it's 64-bit!?)4 cores: 2850 khash/s3 cores: 2130 khash/s2 cores: 1420 khash/s1 core: 700 khash/sWINE (32-bit):4 cores - 2300 khash/s3 cores - 1740 khash/s2 cores - 1150 khash/s1 core - 580 khash/sThank you - looks pretty nice, too.edit: What's the difference between "Sent/Received" and "All transactions"? AMD Phenom II X4 @ 3Ghz Just for comparison:AMD Phenom II X4Bitcoin Version 0.3 (Win 32-bit)Via WINE on Ubuntu 64-bit4 cores - 2300 khash/s3 cores - 1740 khash/s2 cores - 1150 khash/s1 core - 580 khash/sVia 64-bit versionI hope this will come soon...No coins got generated, yet. :-/ So how am I able to transfer less than BC0.01 without getting the message "error in amount" from the bitcoin program? But loosing 1 bitcoin in the ocean of a maximum of 21.000.000 coins seems significant to me, so not comparable to gold and jewelry.So only 21000 losses of 1000 coins can happen. That's not much! I don't thinks it looks ugly.You can change the buttons back to the right side if you wish, just google for it.  Hello,if somebody's loosing his wallet (e.g. due to disk crash) he's not able to get back his coins, is he?So every time a person looses coins, they're lost forever? So the bitcoin network will slowly shrink over time? (Because there will always be people who loose wallets!)TIAvirtualcoinedit: Forgot to mention the coins of users that are try out bitcoin and then never use it again. Nope. ^^ Hi Gavin,nice service, but there was a problem with my first attempt to get the coins: "invalid BC address".So the first address generated by the bitcoin program didn't work - 1Dn51Rn2tmvARcsYkPe7Aw1sCAXw5oKnRWhy? I'm new, but it works fine here. It's version 0.2 though.
