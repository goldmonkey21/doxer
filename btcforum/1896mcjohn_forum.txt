You...messages: 2 views: 209RSS It seems like we will be going from bad to worse.  LiqPay's forum went off - but when it was on, it also showed the recurring theme of people's funds being stucked for 180 days, people only being able to withdraw to Visa, support not being helpful, etc. etc.  Do you want to send your money to Russia/Ukraine?CurrencyFair based in Ireland, http://www.currencyfair.com/ , seems legit enough to trust your funds with. I tried to withdraw the paid for Bitcoins - but MtGox (suspecting this to be a fraudulent transaction), put a 30-day waiting period on my purchased Bitcoin - before withdrawal can be effected.  Are my paid-for purchased items considered delivered, if I cannot withdraw them immediately, and they are not in my full control?  Is it some 30-day fixed deposit without interest?Before the MtGox Paypal account freeze (due to chargebacks of fraudulent stolen credit card transactions on the MtGox Paypal account), I had a positive outlook of MtGox's future, and 30 days would be ok to wait. Currently however, I am hesitant and do not know what will happen with MtGox in the next few weeks? Would that be through the Resolution Centre - suppose for non-delivery of product? With funds otherwise frozen for 180 days (six months!), it might be the only way for everybody to recover legitimately what they contributed legitimately. Original Bitcoin funders could get all their Bitcoins back,andoriginal Paypal funders could get all their USD back almost immediately - not maybe in 180 days (six months!). It seems like good damage control (in order to avoid damage to the Bitcoin and MtGox public image) in present circumstances, might be to reverse all transactions (at original exchange rates, check MtGox low for today? - refund members funded Bitcoins and allow Paypal funders to reverse funding to MtGox - and then start afresh (with a reliable payment processing procedure allowing instant transactions, maybe 3 work days at worst, and not 30 days, for example Western Union, Moneygram, or Liberty Reserve,  Hi all, goto http://www.exchangezone.com/ and register a username - then create a ticket and request them to add Bitcoin to their exchange mediums (they currently let members exchange USD: Liberty Reserve, Alert Pay, Bank Wire, c-gold, MoneyBookers, MoneyGram, Neteller, Paypal  , Pecunix, Western Union; then EUR: Liberty Reserve, MoneyGram, Western Union; WmE & WmZ through their ESCROW!!! services as an auction between the mediums of exchange for the members.Refer to http://www.bitcoinwatch.com/ and http://www.bitcoin.org when making a ticket request to them to add Bitcoin to their exchange mediums.And really MtGox, paypal   is not the only payment processor out there - when will we be getting an update on what your timeframe is for adding another payment processor (as it seems that the finality of MtGox transactions depends on MtGox's payment processor).  Paying out legitimately bought bitcoins to reputable username buyers  immediately should definitely be a consideration (discriminately tested with legitimate successful past transactions in mind - past business trust relationship). Should we MtGox bitcoin buyers stucked with bitcoins in MtGox not all start to consider requesting a MtGox chargeback from Paypal  for having to wait 30 days for product delivery (if it will be 30 days and not 180 days thrown around now - MtGox, business should have a trust relationship - act discriminately and settle transactions with historical trusted parties)  You can send cash wire transfers, or the like, to the poor (ALL) legitimate bitcoin sellers with the (portion of the) money YOU have withdrawn from Paypal from most places in the world (which Paypal could not put a hold on like you have stated in your prior post.)  I would say giving MtGox 7 days from today (before requesting a chargeback from Paypal for non-delivery of product)  to clarify all of this mess would be reasonable.
