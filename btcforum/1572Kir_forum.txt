Hi!I did bitcoin acceptance for sweepmines game and I would like to share this.This is very simple payment acceptance logic. You can find use cases here.To my mind shop should be notified about payments values. So I tried to minimalize shop participation in payment logic - but shop service should store users income amount (storing users id as bitcoin address label is not a problem), because of bitcoin knows about total receives only. And shop should transmit its value to payment system while waiting for incoming payment.Therefore, disadvantage is that shop service should store users income amount to receive delta from payment system. I implemented PS logic and if there will be proper remarks, it will be redesigned and shared.Lets discuss this. Yes, I am. It seems that there were problems with our bitcoind daemon (it leeks much part of memory).Now it works correctly.
