So I was away on a small vacation and I came back to see this all play out, I am happy to see the source code opened although I am sad to see no one stepped up to maintain it. I hop puddinpop will at least release a OpenCL version and help merge it with the official Bitcoin source so that official releases from now on will support OpenCL on all operating systems supported by Bitcoin and OpenCL.Also although I have had problems with the closed source client sending more money then agreed on to puddinpop (this is something I will take up over PM instead of in the forum), I must admit he did a good job because the normal client took me 1 month to get 50 coins while puddinpop client generated 250 coins in only 6 days, impressive.This is not to say no one else has made just as good of a work if not better, it is just that I have only had experience with the work done by puddinpop. Thats the thing, I only generated 1 block not 10 so that is should have been a 5 coin payment not 50, what it says here is balance + 50 and then after it was confirmed it said - 50 with a transaction to 1HZNsUqQxKVLmfPfCAzLwrnVDzx8CxwxnM so there seems to be a problem here, anyone that was just taxed 5 coins and not 50? Just wanted to share my experience, I decided to try this version of Bitcoin, more specifically version 0.3.12.1 beta CUDA enabled and it really works as it increased my generating ability 10x, but it is useless as it is now because after finally having generated my first 50 coins so that I finally had a balance other then 0.00 they were all sent to 1HZNsUqQxKVLmfPfCAzLwrnVDzx8CxwxnM leaving me with a balance of 0.00 again.I thought only 5 coins would be sent not 50, if 50 are sent then what's the point of generating coins if they are all going to someone else? At least with the normal Bitcoin I get to the coins even though I will be generating far less.Did anyone else experience something similar?
