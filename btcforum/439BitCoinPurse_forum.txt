Yes, this will be great milestone in the History of BitCoin! Count me in for 100BTC. Oldie but goodie:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=490 That's was precisely it.  I'm stuck with the 2.3 SDK, though I've tried for days to downgrade...  I'm not in the mood to slick my OS... No, I haven't been able to isolate the issue.  I tried to downgrade to the ATI SDK 2.1, but it didn't take on my crappy W7 box.Also, I'm way out of my league tweaking .cl files.  I'm happy with my 50Khash for now... I got my 1.23 BTC, which will be worth $2,856,092,198.89 someday!  I enjoyed helping the experiment. Running much more smoothly today... Happy to help... I did get the "Target =" message, it just didn't get in the paste.Yes, the old OpenCL miner worked flawless, and the current CPU miner works too.  And yes, new directory for the new miner clients...I have an ATI Radeon HD 5500 Series (Redwood) with Catalyst 10.11 drivers and ATI Stream 2.3.My system is a W7 box with a AMD Phenom(tm) II X2 550 ProcessorI doesn't seem to be "building the kernel"... Same here... New version just reports 0 khash...  Firewall off.C:\Users\Ghandi Gupta\Desktop\Miner>rpcminer-opencl.exe -url=http://mining.bitcoin.cz:8332 -user=xxxxx -password=xxxxxxClient will start 1 miner threadsWork will be refreshed every 4000 ms1 OpenCL platforms found1 OpenCL GPU devices found on platform 0Setting OpenCL device to first device foundAvailable extensions : cl_khr_global_int32_base_atomics cl_khr_global_int32_extended_atomics cl_khr_local_int32_base_atomics cl_khr_local_int32_extended_atomics cl_khr_3d_image_writes cl_khr_byte_addressable_store cl_khr_gl_sharing cl_amd_device_attribute_query cl_amd_printf cl_amd_media_ops cl_amd_popcnt cl_khr_d3d10_sharingDefining AMDMEDIAOPSCreate context rval=0Create command queue rval=0Creating program with sourceBuilding program with options -D AMDMEDIAOPS0 khash/s0 khash/s Are the number of Stream Processors the most effective specification to directly relate a specific GPU to hash/s metrics?For instance: My ATI "Redwood" has 400 stream processors and can push about 36,000 khash/s.  (@90 khash/s per stream)An ATI HD 5970 can put out 560,000 khash/s with 3,200 stream processors (@175 khash/s per stream)My NVidia Quadra NVS 135M has 8 stream processors (hahah!) and does 950 khash/s  (@~120 khash/s per stream)Other metrics don't seem to matter that much, i.e. GPU memory and memory speed, GPU clock speed, bus width, etc. Okay, finally got it to work with CUDA.  I had to set a GPUGRID option to 16.  I'm trying additional options and tracking each.From the looks of it, there's a timeout reached before my system can fully allocate resources. My logins for slush were just fakes for fun.  Are there other worker logins?  Where do I find/set those? Trying CUDA on my laptop...Quadro NVS 135M.  I have the 260.99 drivers and the 3.2 Dev Drivers.  The miner starts and does it's initial config, then errors out after a minute with:..\..\src\cuda\bitcoinminercuda.cpp(147) : cudaSafeCall() Runtime API error : the launch timed out and was terminated.These are my launch params:rpcminer-cuda -url=http://mining.bitcoin.cz:8332 -user=PIMPSARENICE -password=EATMYCODFISH -gpu -aggression=2 Once I installed the ATI Stream SDK (v2.3) for my ATI Radeon HD 5500 Series my GPU mining finally worked!I went from around 2,500khash/s (CPU) to an amazing 30,000khash/s (GPU). Satoshi Nakamoto?!? Today we witnessed a major shift in the two BTC exchange markets.  Bids now outweigh Asks by a margin of about 3 to 1 on GOX (Ask Volume: 3686.57  Bid Volume: 9420.01), and a quick glance at the offers tables at the BCM show many more bids than asks.  It's pretty clear that exchange prices are rising after a slump at the beginning of the week. LOL!  Thanks for the morning laugh! Use fixed rate postage boxes from the US Post Office. If you do trade them for BTC, make sure to arrange the transaction through a middleman Where do you live?
