1. Since private keys start with 5, you're going to be leaking the first digit of your OTP.2. Using your OTP more than once can lead to it being compromised. You're lucky that the underlying private key data is random, but you're in trouble if one of your private keys is discovered. Could you not just use the sha256 sum of the file as a private key?You can then get the public key (bitcoin address) from that.Then you transfer money in and out through that address.This way you're not destroying money, and can avoid the fees for small transactions. Create a transaction AOutput - To whoeverChange - To you.Fee - To Random Miner.Send change in transaction BOutput to Mining pool you want to support.Change - None.Fee - To Random Miner.This way the mining pool is incentivized to make sure both your transactions end up in blocks, but it doesn't really matter who puts them in.You'll just need to set your fees low enough to get your transaction relayed, and if you can submit your transaction directly to a miner you might even be able to avoid needing to do that.  The messages are still coming in. (to /dev/null at least)I emailed a complaint. I recently received an email claiming to be from mtgox (It most certainly isn't)I've not been crazy enough to do anything with the exe file other than delete it. Stick with SI prefixes.10-9 is nanoSo the smallest (current) unit would be 10 nano(bit)coins.Edit: It seems helloworld posted the same thing, but more quickly. I agree with him. How do you prevent it being mixed with other coins? Who is buying Ixcoins and why? off topic of this thread:My reading of that page says that The Mad Hatter is an alias that is interesting. Which is NOT that Tom Williams = TheMadHatter.Edit / Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with bitcoin2cash in any way other than that I've been paid to change my sig to advertise bitcoin2cash.If I discover something shady is going on I will change it.Until then I'm prepared to give the guy a day or two to respond to this thread. Thanks. It seems I had to also delete some old instawallet cookies, but now it gives me new addresses as I'd expect. Is there a way to get a new instawallet address? It keeps giving me the same address and I'd like a new one. You guys (britcoin/intersango/etc) have offline backups of your wallet.dat files right? Surely this is a solved problem in the finance industry?I think I like 3 the best but I'm still not entirely sure what the problem with it is. Watch out for that first step. It's a duzy! Have you checked out http://witcoin.com/ where you can do just that.(Edit: reward/earn bitcoins for good content. Not borrow thyme.) Why isn't a dependent transaction which pays a fee all that is needed? This requires no dropping of existing transactions.1. A+B -> C + D 2. D+E -> F + (G - Fee) In this case the Fee pays for both transaction 1 and transaction 2.The only problem seems to be if you make a transaction with zero change and then want to add an additional fee. But that is up to the choice of the sender anyway. It's thinking like that that got mtgox into trouble. I'd just like to clarify this: There was NOT a bug. This happened before the 100 address pool code was added to the standard bitcoin software. I'm fairly sure they offline computer doesn't even need a copy of the block chain to send a transaction.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transactions Remember you can always post in the 'free' section of witcoin for free and earn witcoins if people think you make good posts.
+1. Good improvement. 1. No it is not.2. No I do not.3. If "society" thinks it is important that you write a cookbook, it will provide you with whatever you need to write it. If they don't then maybe they didn't need it that badly after all. 4. Not necessarily, but also not really relevant.There are other solutions which would allow you to share your recipes with only minimal inconvenience to yourself. Such as allowing a single observer to watch you prepare the meals and take notes on the ingredients and process.Just because you are unable to think up a business model which makes what you want to do profitable does not mean you should be permitted to invent one that benefits you to the detriment of the rest of the society (as IP laws do.) I would claim that IP laws do more harm than good. (with regard to the creation of what is currently called IP) But we have a "tradgedy of the anti-commons"[5] where just because we don't see the things that are not created we don't count them as negatives.Also, +1 on what the 3rd party contract people said.[5] if anyone knows what this is acutally called, please let me know. Confirmed paid. Thanks. will they pay in bitcoins? britcoin.co.ukUK based exchange site. Good list.I need help with number 6 (and number 5 as well apparently. Assuming you're supposed to do something different when the answer is "No") I'm pretty sure this has been discussed before. (I searched but could not find a good link.)Blocks have to be within a certain time window (+/- 2 hours maybe?) of the last block to be valid.If you're winning enough blocks to be able to drift the time in your desired direction you may as well just be directly manipulating the transactions you're including. As an independent observer (who will probably regret posting in this thread):jerfelix you did not win any bet. bitlotto was asking if there was a way he could undetectably cheat at the lottery. You did not provide a solution to this.As for escrows why should bitlotto be any less reliable than any other escrow provider?The solution is simple. If you don't trust bitlotto for whatever reason, don't play his lottery! Ok.How does that thread not already answer your question?As for what I was trying to say, as usual theymos says it better in that thread: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=2965.msg52466#msg52466I think the answer to this question is 'no'.Think of each bitcoin address as a bucket of water. If a bucket is created which contains 50 liters of water. If you combine 10 of these buckets into a big 500L tank, then take out 1L of water from the tank, you cannot tell which bucket the water started in. So therefore the water is not uniquely identifiable. It is the same with "bitcoins". I'm a bit confused by your quoting.Anyway:If I put 2 coins from address 'A' and 1 coin from address 'B' into a new address 'C'Then I spend the 3 from 'C':  1 to 'D' and 2 to 'E'Where did the coin in address 'D' come from? 'A' or 'B'? There is nothing theoretically wrong with this suggestion.You can check that there are bitcoins in your wallet by checking the individual addresses in the blockexplorer.You only need the wallet if you want to spend the coins.I'd be most worried about cloud services being around in 20 years. and/or losing/forgetting my strong password This seems like a good idea. Is there something wrong with it?Is this proposal (or a similar one) discussed in another thread? Or you could just use the -rescan command line option which will go through the block chain and find your missing transactions without having to re-download the block chain.Code:-rescan            Rescan the block chain for missing wallet transactions If you want to do this put the following text into your Signature:   Code:[b]Anonymous Cash-By-Mail Exchange: https://www.bitcoin2cash.com[/b]Signature edit box can be found in: Profile -> Forum Profile Information I'll make this my signature from 13/6/2011 -> 13/9/2011 for 0.10 BTC. (If you change your signature it will require a new agreement.) Any updates BitLex? I got these two messages different to/from names from: "SilverKnife" It is good practice not to make things more complicated than they need to be.Not everyone wants/needs strong anonymity that something like i2p might provide.Feel free to build your own client that does. Good luck emulating 5000Ghash of mining power.I guess you'd just need to be patient. Unless you have a firewall or are on an internal network... You can't buy 0.00001 of a stock.
+1 Lots of people agree with you. They all start their own threads which are almost exactly the same as this one.(I don't agree with you.) Although given the price increase inertia you're probably going to be gambling the equivalent of half a million dollars. Given that the source for this is just a dodgy virtual server provider trying to make up some excuse why they can terminate an account. I wouldn't be too worried just yet. On the internet unk knows you're a dog.Gotta go, my owner just got home. How much does it cost to move GBP to USD?Edit: This is an answer to thekoolio's question rather than a request for information. Can you link to any specific examples of this?All I recall reading are messages pointing out why differing blockchain philosophies are undesirable but they are still encouraging people to try and create their crazy alternate block chains. No one other than namecoin actually has though. Perhaps you might prefer one of the many different "Fiat currencies" which are assured by the Governments that issue them.There are many to choose from. People on Facebook would give you all their personal information for access to a cartoon pig. Why even bother offering them bitcoins? You can still run the system just based on transactions without putting them into blocks.Although things would probably get confusing when people started disagreeing with each other about which transaction came first.This question is akin to asking "will the whole system stop working if a solar flare erases all computer storage in the world?"ie neither realistic or useful. +1 on what Quantumplation said. Another "just use bitcoin" suggestion:You buy 1 bitcoin and donate it for the entire town to use and just trade everything in your town at around 0.000001 (or some other low value.)If you really wanted to restrict it you could release a modified client that would only honor transactions based on the "town origin coin" (but I don't think this is a good idea - it brings back the scam angle.) I'm also interested in the answer to this question, could you please list the facts that explain your answer?Thanks. How is the system they are proposing anything at all like Bitcoin? Surely there are LESS than 10,000 people who can create new USD.Does that make it not a secure currency? I think we need a "slander and conspiracy theories" subforum. Econ majors tend to be the people LEAST able to understand bitcoin. Thanks for the update. It's nice to know there is cool stuff going on. This thread is misleadingly titled.It should be "Free Bitcoins to be found in a game you can play if you download and install some software." Kiba, Here is something I'd like to see.Since I don't have as much time as I used to for reading the forum, I'd be interested in seeing a weekly summary of notable / worth reading  threads.eg:New This Week:Todays difficulty increase to 156000, where from here?    Lots of speculation about speculation and how high the price is likely to go.So I told Bruce Schneier about Bitcoin..   cuddlefish assumes Bruce Schneier reads his own blog comments.Updates:The Bitcoin Weekly Comes Alive    Insti asks for article with cliffs notes on forum posts.   Lots of +1's / me too's follow.   Kiba says he's happy to post something like this and will pay the author 0.5 bitcoins for the article.   No-one actually steps forward to write anything.Gavin will visit the CIA   Arguments about the likelyhood of various conspiracy theories continue.
How do you get your money out of USD and into Bitcoin without an exchange? Is your target market people who live where their power is generated by burning unicorn horns?Electricity would have to be insanely expensive for this to be a good deal. Why is this a good deal for you? People who are paying attention to the reputation system will applaud/+ you to correct for any undeserved smites/- Assuming you occasionally make valuable posts... and if you don't you probably deserve the smite anyway. "Hopefully by now you have figured out that this is a satirical piece demonstrating how ridiculous much of the propaganda in the mainstream media really is.  Thank you for taking the time to read my twisted attempt at humor."I wish he'd put that warning on the top, since I stopped reading the article long before I got to it. Is typing in your own wallet code a supported feature?https://www.instawallet.org/w/free_bitcoins Mine at least. Thanks for pointing that out...(not that I'd put any money in..) Very nice looking site. He's probably gone off to work on something even MORE awesome! link? I'd be interested in seeds for the flower that grows these rings... Worldwide shipping? Hosting/Electricity? This has been discussed before. Search the archives.The general conclusion I think was, that bitcoin is not really the system you should be using for doing lots of microtransactions. So you end up having to bundle your transactions up into larger transactions which means you have to do your own chunk/packet accounting anyway. So you end up with a system that is quite similar to existing ratio type systems. But which allow you to buy your way to a better ratio with bitcoins. (Which is still not a bad idea.) Most people don't know how an internal combustion engine works either, but they still drive cars.. How do you propose this be calculated? You were getting too many applicants at 5   This video is at least a good demonstration that he does not have psychic powers and cannot predict the future.(tl:dw - He uses his lack of psychic powers as an example at one point in the video) I really don't. I think it's a problem when the rss feed is more readable than the sites main page.I like what you're doing with the news aggregation though. Thumbs up for that! Sell just before the bubble bursts.
Why does anyone think low level is a good idea? you're going to spend  all your time having to add 'redundant' zeros. I guess this is discussed at length elsewhere... See this old thread: Vanity bitcoin addresses: a new way to keep your CPU busy I don't understand the poll question.Particularly the high level unit examples.is the '=' sign being used inappropriately? Will you be working on an uploading facility for non-crude images next? There is a free section you can post on for free now.Catch 22 resolved. Splinter networks are good if you already hold bitcoins because you can spend them once on each branch! Something else is using port 80 on your machine.Do you have another apache instance running, or some other application that might be using port 80.Try: Code:sudo lsof -i :80 Well, you enticed me to sign up: http://witcoin.com/witizens/301 Thanks for the reply.But, why is that my (as the rejector) problem? If a donor has sent me some coins, from an address they control in some way, why is that any of my concern if they are using a proxy or not? Surely it is up to the proxy to maintain it's own refund procedures. Once I've returned the money to where it came from the issue is between the donor and the proxy and not me. What is the problem with doing it like that? You can always find out where the coins came from and send them back there again.Try putting an address in http://blockexplorer.com/Although I don't think the standard client provides any way to make sure you send back from the address you received on.Which you probably want to do unless you can prove the other addresses you use are related. Bid: 1 BTCI like maple syrup. Well I don't seem to have won.I also don't know what tickets I had, because I'd picked random. ok the draw details page shows me if I am logged in.. How do I tell if I won?Do I need to go to the site to cashout?Does it send to my BCOUT address automatically so I need to check my bitcoin client? 1) Download the most recent block (X) first.As new blocks (Y)..(Z)..(AA)... come in, add them to the chain as normal.This means new users can start generating straight away, and will see their transactions as soon as they come in.2) Grow the block chain backwards by fetching (W)..(V)..(U).. etcLet the user know when they have the full 'trusted' blockchain from the origin.If they somehow get an evil node X, they'll work it out eventually when the previous blockchain does not validate to the origin. More picks - great idea!Bug(?) - The [pick details] link in the header seems to only link to the pick 6. I'd expect it to take me to a page where I can choose which pick I want to see the details of. If you have not upgraded to > 0.3.9 you will not be able to generate any blocks the rest of the network will accept. If you don't cheat and leave out steps the procedure is:1. Player finds the standard ATITD Bitcoin address somehow. (and still needs to copy/paste it.)2. The player enters his username.3. The player sends the BTC4. Player clicks "I have sent the Bitcoins." (System then verifies and activates account.)I don't see how this is an improvement.(Step 4 in both cases would seem to be redundant if your system is watching bitcoin transactions.)Edit:I'm not sure what is so great about having a single Bitcoin address to receive payments from everybody, since you still need a reference ID of some kind. When individual Bitcoin addresses are trivial to generate. (But you are actually running a service that accepts Bitcoins, so you probably know more than I do.) Another weirdness today. There seems to have been trades at 0.1, 0.106, 0.11,  0.175 but without filling any of the intermediate asks allong the way.The general level staying about 0.062.What is going on?(Guessing from the graph the trades happened at about 20:00 on 14th September 2010.) Ok thanks.How long do your pick bets stay active? until they win? forever? until somebody wins?
The UK government seems to be doing an OK job of it. Whats the point in gathering dollars if they are being both harder to get and lowered in value with time? This seems bad. Website is confusing me.On the main page, On the Left:Next Draws:Block: 8000Blocks to go: xxxPot: xxxSide Pot? xxxBut then on the Right:Pick6Current Pot: 908Last Block checked: xxxAre these 2 different lotteries?Does the pick lottery just keep going until it gives out 1 first place prize?I could not find any information on the 'pick' lottery on the site. something like: https://www.mybitcoin.com/ ? I don't understand why you need to give back any bets.Bets close block: 994 (any bet that is not in by this block is not in the draw.)Winning number comes from block: 1000Any bet in block 995-1994 gets included in the draw for block 2000 "Please check that your computers date and time are correct. If your clock is wrong Bitcoin will not work properly." I dont think the bitcoin client should start bloating itsself with additional NTP client functionality.

No rollover makes this lottery far less desirable to me.
This is cool. You have an interesting idea of what value is.It doesn't matter if there is a piece of paper there or not. Either way, the billing department is going to start asking questions and firing (or worse) the guilty parties. Shops seem to do fine accepting dollar bills which are subject to the same risk. a) Cancel tickets:  1) remove completelyb) Other bets visibility  3) show everything, all the timec) Unclaimed prizes  1) Just roll over to the next drawd) bet price  1) 1e) draw interval  1) every 1k I couldn't find anywhere on the website that said you can only win 1 prize.If you pick 3 do you also win the prizes for the pick 2 and pick 1 since you must have done so? Can you explain this formula more, what are you computing? what are the 0.5 and 0.25 numbers ? What if 2 people did this?(You can make anything a positive expectation if you ignore all the downsides.) That's a pretty slow network you're connected to.You can always just send your transaction direct to the washing machine by bluetooth or something if you want. If I have a debt to you of 10 chickens, and If I were to offer to pay you $50 to settle my chicken debt. (Say the market rate for chickens is $5 each)If you didn't want to take the $50 and instead continued to demand the chickens, the judge would tell you to take the $50 or give up on the debt.. What Y does with his money shouldn't be your problem.If it really has to be, then just pay him 220, or 250 or 400 or however much will mean you never feel guilty about getting a good deal.I'm, probably too much of a sociopath to understand all this.  And it seems to be centralized. I don't understand this post. Are you trying to explain how leaving early is an attack?Edit: I do think leaving early is an attack. They are, (this is bad,) but you can get around it by using another computer with a different wallet file. Why should you not be able to send coins to yourself? No-one knows which addresses you control so there is no way of telling if you are sending to yourself anyway.I encourage you to do this and try to break the Test network.Good luck! chaord, have you read the Bitcoin does NOT violate Mises' Regression Theorem thread?It depends on how many people are using Bitcoins. If millions of people are still using Bitcoins, I doubt it. Whatever the market will pay?What is the premium on whether you'll be around in 10 years for us to exercise the option? I've been doing some more research, and I suspect the above is probably not 100% correct. There does seem to be a difference between the actual public key and its hash, and where each is used.What I am sure of:Transaction signing is done using Elliptical Curve Cryptography.The Bitcoin Address contains enough information to verify that the transaction has been signed correctly. Not sure how far from 'lay' this is straying..The public key is a 160 bit number.The Bitcoin Address *is* the public key. (+ version + checksum + encoding, which all get stripped off when you just need the key.)Transaction signing is done using Elliptical Curve Cryptography. Does it matter? The public key/Address is made public when it gets coins put into it.Either by: a) Coins "falling out of the sky" as a block generation reward.or b) it appearing as an output (TxOut) of a previous transaction.So when you want to check a transaction.  You make sure:a) The Address has the right amount of coins in it. (Because you've seen it before as a TxOut.)b) The transaction has been signed with the private key. (So you know it's the owner spending it.)Edit: Added transaction checking info a) trivial. (whether this is a problem or not is another matter.)b) not sure. I'm guessing 50 was the 'roundest' number for the total not to overflow 64bit integers?
Are you a Judge?I also think you'll find many who don't think things are so "clear". +1 Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials? This sometimes blocks Bitcoin traffic.Any other antivirus programs that may be filtering your traffic? The full transaction history of every transaction everybody makes is available. (If that is what you were questioning.)What do you think is in the block chain?The Anonymity comes from not knowing who 'owns' a particular Bitcoin Address. The public key I use on the coins I actually generate is different from the one I provide to you, which will never generate.Edit: Hmm. This would require generating a separate hash. And it would seem silly to throw away a winning hash to spite the group. I should think more before posting.What about: once I generate a block I leave the syndicate without paying my 50 in? Yes he did, that's why he's getting the error message whenever someone who has not upgraded tries to send him the 'bad' transaction. Unless you run Windows. This is probably too pedantic, but,It's not even keys to a transaction that they are discovering. People are being rewarded for finding the solution to a difficult problem. It just so happens that the best way we know how to solve this particular problem at the moment is just to try it lots of times and hope to get lucky.In which case none of 'discover','mint' or 'generate' seem appropriate.But 'generate' seems to be the most generally used term and it's not too misleading. (but I don't know if it's on fresno's approved words list.) fresno, perhaps you would be kind enough to compile a list of 'banned' words for us? mizeryderia, you just copied and pasted satoshis post without adding any value.You could have tried to address the points he raised, or at least put up a note explaining why this page was on the wiki and what you wanted people to do with it. There is already: http://www.bitcoinmail.com/ Is your computers clock accurate?What does the debug.log file say when it happens?Generating blocks without being connected to the network is a waste of time because they will be never accepted by the network, they'll be too far behind when you reconnect.There are lots of places you can check the current block number, but I like this one: ttp://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/statistix.php because it also has some nice graphs. It is theoretically possible to run Bitcoin through email.You probably wouldn't want to run a 'full' client but it should be possible to construct some kind of email gateway that would proxy transactions for you. I thought that it proved that we can use whatever words we want and define them however we want and just because 'they' use the word 'dollar' to mean something does not mean we can use a word spelled the same way to mean something completely different. Awesome! thanks.  Have you upgraded to 0.3.10?What build are you running? (Downloaded/Self compiled) What architecture/OS?Are you usually a lucky/unlucky person? What is the 'add a link' page for?Here do I get my referrer link from?Are these two things related? How long did you wait?Has windows sneakily installed Microsoft Security Essentials?What happens if you delete the blk*.dat files and try to re-download from the start of the block chain?What is in your debug.log file? Just start making threads in your preferred language.If there is enough interest, you'll probably get a subforum. Commodity should not be on the vocabulary page. (I was assuming the suggestion to put it on was a joke.)It's not a Bitcoin specific term, and isn't relevant to Bitcoin at all, other than so people can argue about what it is/isn't/does/doesn't apply to.
I assume it will take more than 1 second to do.Do we have to do this every time it starts up Can we make a menu option for it, to fire it off manually?And make a counter so that it reminds you to check every n loads/days. or whenever you update the software.It just seems that needing to recheck the entire block chain will be a very rare event, so rechecking the block chain all the time is overkill. +1+1 users of pre .10 cannot generate a valid block until they upgrade. If you're losing the benefit when you spend the coins anyway, it seems like a lot of work for hardly any gain. I can't think of a reason why you'd want to. I was just trying to illustrate that you didn't actually need to generate a private key to create an apparently valid Bitcoin address.You don't need to have a client running to receive bitcoins.Once you create an address, any coins sent to it will just sit there waiting for you to spend them. Any transfer to a 'valid' address should be successful. It is VERY rare for a transaction to be reversed.There are other threads that explain this in more detail.This is not really an Anonymity issue. You can send to an address that does not exist.A bitcoin address has a checksum in it, so it will stop you sending to a 'made up - invalid' address like 1abadadfakjflsdfjadslfjalfjBut it's possible to construct valid non existing addresses if you know what you are doing. But you won't do this accidentally.Being able to verify if an address existed would be bad.Does the address with the lost private key that has 8999 BTC in it exist or not? The chain will be constantly splitting as long as people are generating blocks using pre 0.3.10 clients.They will keep generating new blocks which to include the 'Overflow' transaction.The 0.3.10 network will reject these blocks, but the 'old' network will still accept them.As long as we have more CPU power in the 'new' network, we'll continue to outpace their splits and they will keep readjusting.(and then cause another split again when one of them generates a block)Hopefully they'll work this out when they find that all the blocks they think they are generating never mature. Isn't the external port just for receiving inbound connections?You should still be able to use outbound connections.Or does it complain about not being able to bind to the port when you start? +1 See: http://www.bitcoin.org/faq#How_do_I_backup_my_wallet to find the directory where the blk*.dat files live.DON'T delete your wallet.datI believe the 'good' chain is currently longer than the 'bad' chain, so you should be able to just upgrade to 0.3.10 without having to delete your blk*.dat files.Update: See this post with official confirmation. I was interested in what the SI position was on this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_UnitsSo it should be 100 000.00 OR 100 000,00See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator for more information than you wanted to know.Disclaimer: I'm from a comma comma period country. knightmb, do you still have any of your monster network available to turn on to help build the new valid chain? I do not think that millisecond transaction processing is a necessary feature for Bitcoin. If this is what you really want you should probably build a different system. If you want to interface it with Bitcoin,  just have an exchange which accumulates transactions and post batches to Bitcoins at a speed that Bitcoin can cope with (seconds).Generally: I agree with gavinandresen. This thread currently has more useful information in it. Which makes it essentially powered by tax revenues.except it is a tax you can opt out of by having a clue about computer security. Cayblood, You might like to read through the Scalability thread. You can already run entirely from the USB drive using the -datadir command line parameter.I don't know if you can specify alternate ports yet, there has been discussion about implementing this, but you can proxy through an arbitrary port.See: http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=man_page for more information. Correct. Why did you do this? This was a useful feature to me. This is better.This is worse.Initial IssuanceTo bring coins into circulation, those who generate a new block are rewarded with newly issued Bitcoins in addition to any transaction fees. The amount of new coins awarded will decrease over time eventually reaching zero when there are 21 million total Bitcoins. 
s/instead of/in addition to/In general:You're getting complicated again.. Please explain how. Great article! I'd be interested in seeing a picture.Is there a good reason you wont ship internationally? Your 'wallet' is more like your own personal bankIt contains many different accounts. (in Bitcoin these are called Addresses)Each Address has a balance associated with it, how much money is in it.Your Wallet balance is the sum of all the balances of the Addresses in your wallet.When you perform a transaction, it empties enough Addresses to make up the required output amount, but since it has to completely empty each Address there is often money left over in this case the 'change' is returned to you at a new Address.In this case Stone Man did a transaction that sent all the money from 700+ addresses into a single address and therefore had a wallet containing only one Address that had any money in it.That Address/Account was emptied as part of the 1BTC transaction and the 8999 change was returned to a new Address to which he lost the private key.If he had not consolidated all his coins into one Address, he would have lost far fewer coins.I think the moral of the story might be: "Don't put all your eggs in one basket"No you can't find out which addresses have which balances using the current GUI.I think it is "very important" information.  I also think it is important to be able to chose which addresses are the source of transactions.This is an example of why the wallet metaphor is bad. Adjustment is limited at 400% (up or down)Or you could just pay the seller the extra $300 to ship you the goods 'early'.If they want to do that that is fine. I don't understand why you'd want to do it.The system is pretty good at adjusting to in/out flow of computer power. Is that worse? It just seems pointless. The minute the villain gets bored all the real transactions start getting included again.Everybody still has their money. I don't know if you want to mention that the only possible evil thing you can do with 'bad' transactions is try to double spend money you already have.You cannot make money up from thin air and you cannot steal money from anybody else's account, which very much limits the scope of any possible attack.Fraud is still a problem, but that's a problem in any system. Thanks.That hides them on the main page, but they still show up in the: Show unread posts since last visit view. Has there been any progress on this?What do we need to do to make it happen?A user recently lost 8999 BTC due to this problem, it would be good if we could eliminate it. This should be unnecessary.Please read this post about a better way for the merchant to keep track of who is sending him money:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=711.msg7837#msg7837 Awesome! Thanks. I keep going to the homepage and wondering where the wiki link is.Why can't it have both? If you backup a spreadsheet, do you not expect to lose changes you made after that backup when you restore?There are many types of transactions that will survive a wallet restore. This is one of the circumstances in which you will lose coins.If he'd transferred all 9000 to the address he would still have them.I'm not trying to blame the user. I agree this is a problem that needs to be fixed.This problem has been previously identified and there are plans to implement a fix, which has been talked about in the Privacy versus Safety: handling change thread. But it has not been implemented yet.Perhaps a bounty is in order?According to the theory, generating a address collision is so remotely unlikely as to never happen. (You're more likely to get struck by lightning, win all the worlds lotteries, and then get abducted by aliens on the same day.)However if you manage to find a weakness in a) the encryption method or  b) Bitcoins implementation of it. it may make it easy enough that you don't have to get abducted by aliens as well.So they practically are lost forever. I used bitcointools: http://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcointoolsTo look for your transactions in the block chain.(Here are the edited highlights)Code:python dbdump.py --search-blocks 157PiPgqphedUvrco3mKU3Xoof7yzhj9pW Block: 73261Time: Mon Aug  9 22:08:34 734 tx in, 1 out['TxIn: .... <snipped.

Fixed. Ok, that makes things more complicated again.I suggest just using the first listed TxIn address as the return address + let peoples clients manipulate the transactions so the 'right' value is in that position. This may involve an initial transaction to yourself to put some(all) of the money in a 'refund possible from shop X' address, before the actual payment to shop X.(Now you tell me transaction input order is not deterministic?)'refundtransaction' API call should make it difficult to refund 'bad' transactions.Refunds should not be a common occurrence.I can see how it might be a problem if you are instantly refunding a double spent coin with a 'good' coin.but might it be a better solution to just queue the refund until the incoming transaction was sufficiently mature?It's another convenience/privacy trade off. (Should this discussion be in it's own 'Refunds' thread?) It doesn't help if the big banks are generating all the blocks (with high transaction fees) though. There is no economic incentive to mine at a loss just so you can charge lower fees if you are lucky enough to generate the occasional block. Is it possible to see the market data in tabular form?I can see the cool graphs and get the info with the mouseovering.But I'd like to be able to see the data in a table also.Is there just some button I cannot see? It sounds like they are lost for good.Lesson to other people: Remember you need to back your wallet up after every transaction!(The wallet metaphor is actually a bad one, because it makes problems like this more common than they should be.)Edit: (more explaination)When you do a transaction you always spend ALL of the coins in that address, part of the money goes to whoever you're paying, and there rest is returned to you an a new 'change' address. (This helps your anonymity as someone watching cannot tell which amount you spent and which amount you kept.)Before transaction:Address1: 9000Address2: 0After transaction:Address1: 0Address2: 1Address3: 8999It sounds like you have wallet.dat that contains the private keys for Address1 and Address2, but not Address3.(Although the numbers in your story don't add up.)What were the Bitcoin addresses? (If we know these we can do some more in-depth block chain research) Can we maybe add 'Wiki' to the list of things on that right hand menu?Even though it (currently) goes to the same place as Documentation, it is a different concept.
The micro transaction fee only applies to the the 'out' side.By putting the 'return address' on the 'In' side, we can pass a specific return address if we want.TXIn [ Return Address (0), Address with money (10) ]TXOut [ Payee Address (9.95), Change Address (0.05) ]The return transaction should be indistinguishable from any other transaction. TXIn[ Some other Address (9.95 ) ]TXOut[ Return Address (9.95) ]Anyone who is accepting 'bad' transactions and returning good coins deserves to give their money away. I'm not worried about debasing, more about huge transaction fees being inflicted. Which puts the banks and their massive dedicated server farms back in charge of our money  If you know there is the possibility of a return, you just do another transaction to a new address before the actual transaction so it is only coming from one address. Or you could just make sure the first listed transaction from address was the one you wanted to be the 'return address'Would probably require slight client modification, but should be simple to do.Then we just agree on the standard. (which is all the system is anyway.)Are transactions allowed to have input addresses with a zero balance? I enjoyed A+ would watch again. You also don't have to prove to the notary that you have X BTC in your account to spend.Although I was recently reading about Zero-knowledge proofs if you could use something like that to prove that your account had X BTC in it without revealing anything else it might be what you're looking for.I'm just worried what you want is theoretically impossible. You should use the Test network Good question. No. I often use 'Show unread posts since last visit' to view the posts I've not read.Currently I just view all the threads I'm interested in and then mark the rest as read.Since I don't read russian, is there a way to exclude posts in the russian forum from that view?or can I automatically mark them as read?or do I just keep doing what I'm doing?or should I just learn russian? In your system, Rather than just getting transactions from the block chain  I just have to watch every transaction (which I'll see anyway) and log them to my secret server.You're just advocating security through obscurity. This article is really improving.1) If I'm reading this article and I get to the "but new issuance will forever halt at exactly 21 million coins." line. I'm thinking "21 million is never going to be enough." and stop reading there.Maybe:Bitcoins have no central issuer whereas fiat currency is issued at will by a central bank. Currently, Bitcoins are slowly being issued in a decentralized manner, but in ever decreasing amounts, which will eventually stop.If you're going to talk about there 'only' being 21 million, you need to talk more about the divisibility (I think I said this before..). And you need to make sure that the divisibility talk is in the next sentence!But for a general overview piece I don't think mentioning the 21million number is relevant at all.2) Dealing with dishonesty.This section is better than it was but it is still waaaaay too confusing.(Here I quote it and put the readers questions after each section.)"Not everyone is allowed to publicly confirm the validity of new transactions  if this were true, the system would be too easy to fool if a large number of users were dishonest" - What? Why? So it is a centralized system?"Instead, after successfully auditing the transaction, users must place the new transaction on top of a virtual stack of the previous transactions." - Ok (skeptical about where this is going)"To seal the transaction on the top of the stack, they must perform very difficult computational work  this is akin to the physical work required to cement blocks on top of one another." - Why do they need to do something difficult? Isn't that thermodynamically perverse?"As a reward, those who complete this work first get a small transaction fee," - So I'm still paying a fee, this is no different from credit cards."and then they share the new stack with other honest users who audit and verify that it is correct." - They don't share it with the dishonest users?"Honest users accept the tallest stack as the correct and most up-to-date consensus." - If a stack is taller it has more transactions? What do dishonest users do with it?"Dishonest users cannot possibly build a stack of false transactions continuously faster and taller than honest users," - Why?"because it is likely that the combined computational resources of honest users will be greater than that of any single cooperating group of dishonest users." - The bad guys can just make lots of transactions to themselves, this will make their stack taller."Even if a group of dishonest users managed to get more resources than honest users, they would have to decide between using it to earn legitimate transaction fees, or to destroy trust in the currency and thus the legitimacy of their own wealth." - What if the government wanted to destroy the system and was not concerned about creating wealth with it? The 'from' Bitcoin address is stored in the transaction, you don't need any extra information.Sending money back where it came from is not difficult. I don't understand the question.  100,000 is more than 2% of all the Bitcoins currently in existence. It's the same process.If you can find a 'winning' block, you get 50 BTC + whatever transaction fees apply to the transactions in that block.Turning on "Generate Coins" in the GUI enables block hashing. Perhaps if Bitcoin was a fictional money system they would have not deleted the page  What's the story with the handshaking triangle things people are using for their avatars?eg:I think I've seen one or two others around too.. A similar idea is discussed in this post (and the associated thread):http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=596.msg6162#msg6162 Are: 1) The transaction fees charged entirely up  to the block processing node? Or 2) The transaction fees enforced by the network, which would mean that any block that contains an 'invalid' transaction because it did not include the correct fee would be rejected? RHorning I think you need to do some more reading up on transaction fees.http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=transaction_fee is a good place to start.Topic: Flood attack 0.00000001 BC is another thread worth reading.
Stuff like this. I'm guessing your audience already understands the disadvantages of fiat currency.   Bitcoins have no central issuershould be enough.On a separate point.If you talk about how there will never be more than 21 million you also need to talk more about the divisibility. (you currently only mention it briefly right at the end.) I'd mention that 8 decimal places is however many gazillion  and how that compares with the number of USD currently in existence. Simplifying in a way that is not misleading about how the system works is preferable. You seem to be also explaining a lot of financial concepts, this would seem to be unnecessary?There also seems to be a lot of redundant text throughout.I think you undermine any trust you may have built up with your final paragraphs that talk about how bitcoin is likely to get hacked and lose all its value any minute now.What do they need to know to trust it?What are the basic points you think they need to know?The article is getting better. This probably should be in it's own thread.How no-technical is your audience? My Mom wouldn't understand any of this.I just ended up confused. (and I know how the system works!)Traditionally when explaining cryptography you use Alice and Bob.Starting with explaining asymmetric cryptography is not a good way to start.People have more than 1 key pair.This is what a bitcoin address is.A wallet is the sum of the transactions made with an address to which you have a private key.The block chain is independent of the wallet.This section confused me.This section confused me too.Overall much of what you are saying is mostly true, and I can kinda see what you're trying to do, but the whole thing just left me confused.It's hard to tell which points you're 'simplifying' and which points you don't actually understand yourself. I suspect you understand things better than you've explained them here.Who is your target audience?What is your goal with this piece?Why did you choose to explain things in the order you did?Sections that are missing: What is Bitcoin?Why should I care about Bitcoin?What is in it for me? (hint: it's not minting coins by generating blocks)I suggest you start a new thread about this topic.I think you've made a good start on things here, it just needs some refining.I'd be happy to keep working on this with you.Sorry my criticism was not more constructive. Thanks, I've added your answers to the http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=more_faqs page on the wiki.The more faqs page is a page where FAQ answers can be updated and refined before they are added to the main static FAQ page. Amazingly small.There is also a 'nonce' - a number which is not important to the block, but acts as a "mixer"  which is incremented for each hash attempt. So you're never trying to hash the same value twice. You do realize a moving average does not have to be animated, right?Update: http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/statistix.php has non animated moving averages so I guess you do. The moving average line is a great addition to the graphs!Thanks. There is not currently any way to split/merge wallet files.I think that eventually someone will write the code to export/import Bitcoin address private keys and then you'll be able to split/join as much as you like.Password protecting the wallet file is discussed in some threads here and will probably happen.If you want to see either of these things happen soon either:a) Code them yourself and contribute a patchb) Set up a bounty (in BTC) for someone who will.c) Wait.(We probably need a public bug tracking/feature request system.) http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=transaction_feeYou should be able to transfer money to yourself if you like.The client will warn you if you're attempting a transaction that will incur a fee.(and it is in fact currently pretty hard to make a transaction that will require a fee!) Yes.Transaction fees.Thanks! If you mean Bitcoin address, you shouldn't even need this.Exactly. It all comes down to how much you trust the entitiy you are transacting with.If I'm paying the kid mowing my lawn in Bitcoin 'notes' I know I'm honest. If there is some problem we can sort it out when he comes back next month.If I'm buying my groceries from 'Big Grocery Store' (BGS) they will be doing online transaction processing to verify my Bitcoin notes are valid before I leave the store, and I can trust that the notes they are printing me for my change will be valid.If I'm borrowing 10BTC from my friend, he can pass a note from the BGS to me because I can trust he he's not double spending it. The note can proceed down the chain of trust.If I'm buying a DVD from a guy on a street corner, he might not be inclined to take my bitcoin note (unless he has an iPhone to check the transaction is valid) and I'll probably want to use exact change, because I'm not going to trust any notes he gives me in return.Bitcoin notes are a great solution when you are:a) Offlineb) Dealing with someone you trust.It also doesn't prevent you choosing to use some other method.It just provides you with an extra option. Which is a Good Thing. The thing that you are buying goes from A -> BWhere A is the Asker, B is the Bidder I think a focus on the mining is the wrong way to go. Particularly now that mining is hard. (Much harder than the article suggests)It gives people an unhelpful analogy of what the Bitcoin system is all about.Perhaps another one focusing on the benefits for those wishing to do online transactions without the high fees charged by the existing payment processors?Particularly those running online shops. We need more people to be selling stuff we can buy with all these Bitcoins burning holes in our pockets. Is bitthanks still active?I've noticed the image has disappeared from my signature, and I've not noticed them in anyone else's lately.. There are a lot of good pitches coming out here guys. Nice work.The more different examples we have, the easier it will be to find the one that suits your 'target'.The pitch to a cryptoanarchist is going to be different to the pitch to your grandma.Keep them coming.Anyone else? You seem to have things backwards.The "dice rolling" is to maintain the "chain of proof".Actually giving out the coins is a side effect.I have 2 questions for you: Without high computational burden how do you propose we:a) Maintain the integrity of the system?b) Distribute/Seed the system with coins? Ok, when you said monitoring I thought you meant monitoring, so I was just pointing out that all the transactions were trackable in case you did not already understand this. Since it seems you do it's not a problem It seems we have differing opinions on the way future will develop. Which is fine.It'll probably turn out nothing like either of us expect anyway. Every transaction is monitored in the bitcoin system.That is your requirement for trust, not mine. You can trust a transaction as soon as you see it if you like.And people are going to shop with those who will give them speedy transactions.Clearly. Anyone who currently uses PayPal for a start.I don't. But I'm just one person. Recently on IRC someone said:"I could've presented the system more clearly, but you know, bitcoin is a very difficult thing to explain briefly"I've also been thinking a lot about how to briefly and accurately explain Bitcoin to people. What might be your Elevator pitch for Bitcoin?
So the solution to avoiding a big company/government regulation is a big company/government?It is currently possible with Bitcoin to do transactions which are practically instant particularly if you do not fear some vast conspiracy to defraud you.If you really do have need of transactions faster than Bitcoin can offer, use a different system, but you will probably have to forgo some of the benefits that Bitcoin currently offers. I think we are looking at things slightly differently.This is how I think you are thinking about your process.Your shop publishes an address: A_SHOP Customer does a bitcoin transaction from A_CUST to A_SHOP for 9.95 and passes extra parameters 'from: customer@email.address' and 'for: your cool ebook'Your bitcoin payment system picks up this this transaction.Your system sends 'cool ebook' to 'customer@email.address'Another Customer does a bitcoin transaction from A_BOB to A_SHOP for 9.95 'from: bob@somewhere.else' 'for: audiobook version'Your bitcoin payment system picks up this this transaction.Your system sends 'audiobook' to 'bob@somewhere.else'In my proposed system it works like a traditional shopping cart/checkout system:Customer comes to your shop. Clicks the 'buy cool ebook button'Fills our their delivery address on a web form. You create a unique receiving address for this transaction: A_UNIQUE1 You note this mapping in your database. A_UNIQUE1 is 9.95 payment from 'customer@email.address' buying 'your cool ebook'Your website then presents the customer with the address A_UNIQUE1 Customer does a bitcoin transaction however they like for 9.95 to A_UNIQUE1Your bitcoin payment system picks up this this transaction.Your system sends 'cool ebook' to 'customer@email.address'Bob comes to your shop.Clicks on the 'buy audiobook button'Fills our their delivery address on a web form. You create a unique receiving address for this transaction: A_UNIQUE2You note this mapping in your database. Your website then presents the customer with the address A_UNIQUE2Bob does a bitcoin transaction however they like for 9.95 to A_UNIQUE2Your bitcoin payment system picks up this this transaction.Your system sends 'audiobook' to 'bob@somewhere.else'Is that clearer?The advantages of doing things this way are that you have control over the information that the customer is sending you before they actually send it.If you decide to sell tshirts and need to include a 'size' field you can easily add this on your web end.If they're trying to buy something that is out of stock, or if they are below the legal age you can deny the transaction and not give them an address to send to.PM me if you need any help implementing such a system. If the problem you are identifying is that too much attention isI would tend to agree with you on the first part, but disagree on the second. Chosing the 'winners' is a side-effect of the security of the system, if we were to choose the winners just based on picking a random address out of the transaction list this would certainly be less resource intensive, but you still need to make sure that the that the blocks cannot be easily forged by an attacker.Perhaps you could contribute your ideas on how bitcoin should be publicized. We (the bitcoin community) don't have a large corporate PR department who are paid to sit around and come up with good ideas. Bitcoin video bounty thread might be a good place to start.Another problem is that there is no one controlling focus group to set the direction of Bitcoin publicity and there are people who want to use bitcoins for all kinds of different reasons. P.S. Thanks for the tip. This seems like the "wrong" way to be doing things.Your webserver should be capturing all these details and generating a unique receiving address.So you know what a transaction to XYZ is for and who it is from.Then you just need your webserver to query your bitcoind to see if transaction XYZ for 10BTC has occurred. I don't accept that.The idea that the value of a Bitcoin is in some way related to the value of the electricity required on average is a fallacy that has been widely spread by armchair economists to get-rich-quick merchants who don't understand the system.It's not about the minting at all.The computation required is to maintain the integrity of the system by growing the block chain which serves as a 'timestamp' of transactions.It is probably possible to make the computation required for this process less than it currently is, but it would be at the expense of disk space or bandwidth or integrity or processing power required to validate transactions, or all of the above. The current system provides a good balance of all these things.The minting is just a side effect, and an elegant way to reward those who have contributed processing power to the integrity of the system.There are many other threads that try to propose 'better' ways of rewarding these contributions, but the 'winner takes all' system is the one we have at the moment.Good luck with implementing compucoins..Again, it is not about the minting OP, have you read the Bitcoin snack machine thread? Why is ip to ip a useful way to make a transaction? Isn't the 'problem' you are describing the problem with ANY monetary system? You have too much trust in hardware manufacturers. Walmart might be interested in the low transaction fees.They probably have special deals but they're probably still paying a lot of money to companies like VISA for their transaction processing. Yes, this was covered above.In your scenario there are two outputs, 1 is 1 BTC and the other is 0.005 BTC.0.005 < 0.01 therefore a fee applies to the transaction. Why not?I don't see how size would make a difference.Is it just due to the number of transactions that the system is able to handle? Someone with one Bitcoin can already send 100,000,000 transactions, by repeatedly sending the coin to themselves. How is it any different if the value of the transaction is 1 or 0.00000001 ? This information is in the transaction record stored in the block chain.It is not currently visible in the client frontend.I think Bitcoin is much less anonymous than YOU think. What exactly is this 'dust spam' that this 0.01BTC transaction fee "solving"?It seems to do more harm than good because it prevents micropayment implementations such as the one bytemaster is suggesting.I'm not aware that the network is straining under the weight of the existing transaction volume.Anyone wishing to send a lot of transactions can already do this by sending x BTC to themselves a lot. Since there is no way to tell which is the 'change' transaction.That's kinda cool. (and somewhat horrible at the same time.) Like this one:http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=websites_accepting_bitcoin Surely this is not correct?The 1 BTC transaction is a transaction with 1 input and 2 outputs, but it's still only 1 transaction. Because no-one has written the code to do so.aceat64 is correct.The transaction history knows where the money came from and where it goes.That the client does not show things like this does lead to a lot of misunderstanding of how things work. So do we NEED an inflationary economy for anyone to actually do anything other than sit at home on their pile of bitcoins  with a shotgun?
I'm not familiar with a lot of the manga related terms you used but it sounds like there is some copyright infringement going on.I'm not sure how using bitcoins will make anything different. Are you just trying to make it harder to trace who does what? Thanks for your well thought out replies guys.I do not agree that this is necessarily true.It probably doesn't matter if no-one lends anyway. We'll just end up with the anti-Tragedy of the commons where it gets overgrown because no-one is going to let their cows out onto it. People in general are REALLY bad at observing the negative effects of things that do not happen. You could use the chain to send messages by constructing transactions that sent money to yourself that others could watch for.The client developer owns address XYZ (hardcoded)The client knows any transaction from address XYZ will be informational.The developer sends a transaction from XYZ to any other address that he owns. The amount encodes a certain amount of state - so a 1 BTC transaction might be 'there is a new version'The developer can then send the money back to the XYZ account to resend the next message with. Interesting video.I think this helps explain why so many people have such an issue dealing with the concept of deflation. Red did have a question about it which I've tried to answer myself:If everyone just hoards the economy stagnates. By lending out bitcoins it is possible to stimulate growth in the economy.As a simple example: Say 1 bitcoin buys you 1 loaf of bread, and the entire economy is based on comparisons to loaves of bread.Scenario 1:At the start of the year I have 1000 bitcoins, I lend out 100 for 1 year at -50% interest.This stimulates the economy to grow 100% At the end of the year, I will have 950 bitcoins, but they are worth 1900 loaves of bread.Scenario 2:1000 bitcoins, I lend out 0.The economy doesn't grow at all, At the end of the year, I will have 1000 bitcoins, but they are still only worth 1000 loaves of bread.There is a lot more math you can do to cover more complex scenarios and make more acurate estimates of growth, but I think this illustrates the general principle. In a thread in the general discussion forum bytemaster made what I think is an awesome post. Unfortunately the thread then wandered in a different direction, but I thought the post merited further discussion, and this was the best place for it.Discuss. +1 Instead you pass the hassle onto the user by making him have to tell you which bitcoin address he will be sending from?I think I'll shop somewhere else. URLified those for you. Direct link to their Bitcoin Thread: http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?t=2089262They really don't "Get it" over there. Yes.  A 'wallet' might better be called a 'private bank' which is filled with many different account numbers, each of which contain a number of 'coins'.2-5, what Red said.You always have to spend all the money in an account (address) at once.eg:I have 10 BTC in Address1, I want to pay you 1 BTC.TXin:Address1: 10 BTCTXout:Address2: 1 BTC (this goes to you)Address3: 9 BTC (this goes to me - the change)Address1: is now empty.A cool side-effect here is that anyone analyzing the transactions can't easily tell if I paid 1 BTC or 9 BTC. (assuming they know I have Address1, but don't know who has Address2 or Address3) Shouldn't it be able to fix itself without having to delete the block data?As long as everyone with an 'old' client stops generating, the bad fork should get shorter and die?Just checking my understanding. They could do that. But we know the hash of the genesis block of the 'real' bitcoin so we wouldn't be accepting any of their bogus transactions.This is no different from me opening a beverage factory, putting some muddy water in cans, and calling my product 'Coke'. I might be able to fool some people who've never experienced the real thing, but no-one who knew what Coke was would touch it.  You may like to tell us what it is so we can tell you if we think it will work. How does your solution solve the problem in the OP?It seems to be that instead of just tracking all bitcoin transactions I now have to track all bytecoin transactions as well. Which isn't that difficult if I'm determined. What is Legal Tender?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender"Legal tender or forced tender is an offered payment that, by law, cannot be refused in settlement of a debt, and have the debt remain in force." Short Answer: No. You seem to have reworded some questions but I don't think they are any clearer.Sorry.The best answer I can give to any of these questions is: "Maybe"Perhaps you'd be better off using the search function to find the threads where these issues have been discussed and deriving the questions from the answers provided. I don't know how to answer these questions. Perhaps others have similar problems.2. What does "Inflation proof" mean?3. What is "legal tender"?4. I don't understand what this question is asking. If the bitcoin economy is deflating and everybody is hoarding. then: The bitcoin economy is deflating and everybody is hoarding. However it is still a frequently asked question.Coming up with an answer that is better than "it's ridiculous" will probably be required. (unfortunately..) If you track the progress of a real USD $1 bill, from your pocket and it ends up in the pocket of a terrorist, at what point are you liable?Using the logic you suggest the US Federal Reserve is the biggest terrorist funder of them all.(Discussion of whether they are actually deliberately funding terrorists omitted)Using a bitcoin market will probably not solve the problem you suggest.And in fact probably makes things worse because it anchors your bitcoin transactions to your real world identity at 2 points. (assuming you're not managing to anonymously buy BTC, in which case that DOES solve your problem and you can just ignore all the steps prior to 3d)Just only do honest things with your bitcoins and you'll be fine.
Did you look at the Probability Table on that page?Even if everybody in the world was running a client you'd still not be getting close to a 10−18 probability of a collision.Admittedly this number is not zero but I never claimed it was impossible either. Everybody is working on a different problem so it is very unlikely anyone is trying to hash the same value. Either way is good for me, I seem to spend all day hitting refresh on both unread forum posts and wiki changes anyway. Perhaps we should use the Development & Technical Discussion forum and prefix all our subjects with "Wiki:"If we end up with too many threads they'll give us a subforum. I've also been thinking about this.Can we just create a meta: namespace on the wiki?meta:wiki_discussionmeta:style_guidelinesmeta:pages_that_need_improvementetc.At least discussing stuff in this thread is a start.  Just to clarify, I was referring to the coinflip experiment above. Where I hold only 1/3 of the coins in play but win more than 1/3 of the points availiable. (Which is not an illusion based on small sample size)I am not in possession of the mystical bitcoin fountain. I'm just thankful the difficulty isn't 244.213223092375323881335701184896212407930361873708113773326734402748260502489 1554339282075169582811726687822061777635447902413461818393548574922122914786456 6654051064077556842993973623686279076537890477160907158869253835628402573582928 17840402922938076799907Just imagine how hard it would be to win a block then!!!!! Prettymuch.See the Bitcoin snack machine thread Great work NLS! I was hoping you wouldn't work all that out until after you'd taken my bet The next "paradox" is that since I'm doing 1/3 of the hashes and winning more than 1/3 of the time is it actually better to run fewer hashes/second?  I'll take this bet. How much do you want to play for? You should not dismiss it as a joke game just because you find it easy.Some of us have to work hard at it, learning all the spells and attacks and things. Maybe I should find an easier game to play. However there is currently also no way to control which address any payment you make comes from. So you could be unwittingly connecting "Grandmas  birthday money" to "Hot goat porn". Which could lead to some loss of anonymity.But no, you cannot currently hot swap wallets. The "8 with a line through" variations just make it look like the price of whatever it is you're selling used to cost 8 but now costs something else.I like the unicode capital B with the circle around it. ⒷIf it looks bad it's just because the font designer probably didn't put a lot of effort into that one particular character. That is not going to happen though. Your anonymity is not good if it relies on other people forgetting things. Awesome! thanks  This "Balance Sheet" concept does not need to be separately implemented.You can already forget as many transactions as you'd like.It is covered in section 7 of the whitepaper pdf.(And you actually only need to remember the 'TxOut' portion of any transaction.)Either way you'll have to store about the same amount of data. Cool thanks, I trust your calculations more than mine (which were 5 mins and a spreadsheet.) Have a browse around the wiki: http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=bitcoins Thanks Andrew.All your hard work is not going unnoticed. Isn't this just a result of restoring to an out of date backup?That aside, Simple possible change return methods:a) change gets returned to the address it came from.b) change gets returned to a newly generated bitcoin address.Most people wont care and will expect the a) behavior, so make this the default.Those who care about the privacy of their transactions can enable b) through some option setting in the client. Probably better to discuss it here.Here is what you posted:
Try the Bitcoin Economics ForumYou should be able to find many discussions about this topic there.This thread is about the proof of work difficulty number. what is the issue? 1) I suspect you are missing some factors from your 'rationatlity' assessment.If I have a large stock of bitcoins, I want to keep the system alive so that I don't lose my value. In this case it is rational for me to expend more in energy costs than I would be rewarded for block processing.I agree bitcoin generation should stabilize at the energy breakeven point, with processing power coming on and offline in line with market movements.But, by the time this happens the amount of processing power involved will be HUGE and I suspect no government will have enough to take it offline by technical means.2) How will a government destroy the system with excess CPU power?  This is currently not possible with the standard client.I expect soon there will be tools that low importing and exporting of wallets.Then you will be able to do what you want. The beauty of bitcoin is you don't need 3rd parties like banks.I can see how an escrow could be useful.Surely it's still possible to do this without one.Adding an escrow will add cost to the transaction. The difficulty value is derived from the current target.You can find the current target by "grep"ing 'After' in the debug.logEdit: Oh ok, you already know that, nevermind. You can act on a transaction before it is included in a block.So you can still check for double spending in all the transactions you can see already.So to buy 2 snacks with the same coin you'd have to spend it at 2 distant nodes simultaneously and get your snack faster than the network propagation time.So vending machines are easily possible and the scope of the attack is actually quite limited? How would a Bitcoin snack  machine work?1) You want to walk up to the machine. Send it a bitcoin.2) ?3) Walk away eating your nice sugary snack. (Profit!)You don't want to have to wait an hour for you transaction to be confirmed.The vending machine company doesn't want to give away lots of free candy.How does step 2 work? I think there is still some manual work involved in running it and the guy needs to sleep sometimes. Thats a limitation of this implementation of the client.the senders bitcoin address IS in the transaction data: (This is a randomly selected transaction dumped by bitcointools)['TxIn: prev(eed0...7ba2:1) pubkey: 1HyJzQh5i8vJ91kaLnbemTWzRPMnJpnFC3 sig: 73:3046...0701 65:04e0...bca4']['TxOut: value: 320.00 pubkey: 1HCvjbEUG8rLdUeXZPoKVxHfKwbU7aRi5A Script: DUP HASH160 20:b1c3...fb46 EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG', 'TxOut: value: 5.00 pubkey: 16RJhLEjd7YyYytVoABB9kgGQr5DAEyWaw Script: DUP HASH160 20:3b71...934b EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG'] Only if you have the private key, in which case it's not really spoofed.(I'm talking Bitcoin addresses, not ip addresses.) Has the SHA1 fingerprint changed? I'm not getting this value when I check it.(firefox seems to not be letting me cut and paste what I am getting...) Not all the nodes will be 'rational' 1 twitcoin for you! Somewhere around block 5,355,000 (this will be sometime around 2111 at 6 blocks an hour.)I expect many things will have changed by then though.  You sound like you want to be integrating with the https://www.mybitcoin.com/ guys. You don't really want to be bloating the transaction history, which everyone has to carry around in the block chain, with peoples comments as well.If you need to know who a transaction is from you can:a) create a one time receiving addressorb) get them to submit their sending address and check for transactions from there. (send from specific addresses would need a client modification but not a protocol modification)  It really should be "BTC" rather than ฿.  ฿ is also already used by a real world currency.If it's a question for a web developer, I'm sure there's plenty on here who could advise you. If that's how you want to define Coin that's up to you. I still maintain that a Coin is not a "thing", a block is, and a transactions is, but a coin is not.That certainly sounds sensible.Have you measured how quickly the blocks are generating lately? It's more than 1 every 10 minutes.Try doing a transaction and noting the block number when it goes to 1/unconfirmed. You will then see that the confirmation value is the same as the number of blocks 'elapsed'. Also, it seems not to be able to cope with fractional amounts.I wanted to make a listing that was for 0.01 BTC but it listed it as 'Free'
+1 Important things you have left out:"Address" and "Chain"A "Coin" is not a thing. A coin is a concept. An address 'holds' coins.Block is correct. Blocks form a chain.Transaction is a transfer of coins from one address to another address.Ok, You seem to be going into a lot of technical detail for a general guide.What you have said here is correct, but it took me a while to work out what you were trying to say.Your ideas about verification are wrong.Once you receive a 'solved' block, you see if you think it is good. if it is, you start again using this recent blocks hash.A block becomes 'confirmed' or 'verified' as by being buried deeper in the chain as new blocks are added.I found the rest of this loop a little confusing, it seems more or less right though.This is correct.This is not.Hopefully some of that is helpful.Try asking specific questions about the bits you don't understand. Unfortunately, not really. Did you check out the wiki? It's being constantly updated.I'll make another post trying to explain where you've gone wrong, but it might take a little time. Difficulty only adjusts every 2016 blocks.The amount of processor power being applied is increasing faster than the difficulty is adjusting so we're getting about 27 blocks per hour at the moment.There will be a big difficulty jump later today when we hit 68,544 blocks. 0/unconfirmed means that your client has seen the transaction1/unconfirmed means that your transaction has been included in 1 block, at this point you can be reasonably sure someone has picked up your transaction and it's now in the chain.as the number of confirmations increases, so does the confidence in the 'truth' of the transaction.There is no way to cancel a transaction.It is not possible with the current client to resend a transaction. I suspect they are not as anonymous as you think they are. you know you're not actually making 'progress' right? http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=325.msg2935#msg2935 I'm not a fan of massive signatures. My own is already too long .Perhaps you should rethink what is in it? Why? I don't believe I'm doing anything illegal where I live. Majority of the cpu power is probably more technically correct than 50% of the nodes.As long as the patched nodes are generating blocks faster than the unpatched nodes they will 'win'. This thread has some more information: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=241.0 You can still access the coins from the other addresses and they still work to receive coins, check your Address Book. This could be solved with a software patch to modify the difficulty, as long as it could be distributed to 50% of the nodes... Correct  Why? get luckier  Your cube solving analogy was accurate.Once someone solves 'their' block, and broadcasts it to the network, it becomes the 'next' block at the tail of the chain.At this point everyone else gives up on the block they were working on and starts working on a new block based on the new tail.It doesn't matter which block 'wins' as it will contain the hash of the previous tail block, which is the important bit.Since the network as a whole tries to generate a new block every 10 minutes, 10 minutes is about how long any PC will work on any one block. Might it be useful to make a 'More FAQs' page on the wiki in which new FAQs can be evolved and the most frequently asked ones can then be copied to the main site FAQ? You are right about the nonce and the hashing, but..Everybody is working on a different block.To pay the block creator 50BTC you need to know the Bitcoin Address it needs to go to. For the block creator to be able to spend the 50BTC they create, they need to have the private key associated with the bitcoin address the 50 was paid to.Since everybody has a different private key (randomly generated), everyone has a different  Bitcoin Address (associated public key (hashed))Part of what makes up the block is the hash of the transaction that pays the 50BTC to the block creators Bitcoin Address.This means that everybody has a different block. Whoever solves their block first 'wins' and that block is acclaimed by all as the 'next' block. Isn't just changing the genesis node enough?Each branch would just ignore the others 'invalid' blocks and transactions.(although it would probably be polite to try and construct a different network.)
