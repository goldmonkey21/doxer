For everyone thinking there is a 1000USD / BTC withdraw limit, I was informed by mtgox that this can be "easily lifted".  I had over a thousand BTC withdrawn within a few minutes by an attacker. All my coins were stolen, I immediately filed a ticket (two days ago) and was assigned #1407.  I would appreciate a reply. Fair enough, but what about the daily (monthly) withdraw limits being circumvented? Strong by most standards, letters, number, special characters.  Nothing in a dictionary. Same thing happened to me last night, someone purchased BTC with all USD and withdrew the BTC.  5K in USD and  600 BTC gone with the wind.  Change your passwords people. Any chance of adding a "Your Shares" column to the block history table on the statistics page? I have completed a transaction with silverman.I placed a request at 1900 on 8/23/2010, received a reply at 2300 8/23/2010, sent BTC a few moments later, received a confirmation email with pictures at 1511 on 8/24/2010 and have the coins in hand as of this evening 8/27/2010.  They may have come yesterday as I did not check the mail until this evening.  Both quarters are in good shape and are in fact silver as advertised.It was a good transaction and I would perform another trade. Nothing fancy, just click this please:  http://fxnet.co.cc/?ref=31 Working on 32 bit Slackware 12.2 and 13.0 (with updated gcc-g++).  I have not reverted the upgrade to test if it works with the stock gcc. The volume currently shown is as of the last update which happens every 2 minutes.  So when a trade occurs the volume will show up only until the next update.You can see the total daily volume and prices by downloading the Intraday .csv file from the "Trends" page.
