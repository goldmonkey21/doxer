You could change the crypto world by surprising everyone that an announcement like yours does not turn out to be a scam. Good luck with that!   Haha yes sounds reasonable. They say they want to expand globally and you right away say you are impressed with their idea. I also want to expand globally, am I impressing you?  That guy let's you fly to the moon with a rocket. Those journeys are real, no dreams or hallucination. Roberto can also send you to the moon, but it isn't real.  At some point in time they will need a clear agenda that they themselves can follow up on or otherwise it will end up in unproductive back and forth that isn't good for anybody. Essentially you are saying that the only thing required for success is a huge team? Doesn't sound like the super power plan to me. You need the right people in the right place, and quantity is secondary. I also agree, but then you have people who are impatient and want updates every single day, which is also impossible.  Given that Lisk's market cap is close to half a billion dollars, a 60 BTC buy wall isn't as impressive as some people would think. There are probably a lot of whales that could fill that order with just one action.  I would disagree with this statement. Joining your network doesn't necessarily make you a philanthropist. I think there is more to that.  Will the whole profit be distributed among the security token holders or will part of that go into the team's pockets?  Where does this figure come from and can it be confirmed by the team? It comes across as being a bit unrealistic.  Yes but he is not the only one trying this. There are many coins that have no use case except for the dev claiming there is a use case... They make a coin and say please use this for buying nutrition...  There are of course limits to the money a bot can make if you reproduce it and distribute it. Your example lacks logic. A shared bot means shared opportunity. How could it be different? If your bot exploits an opportunity and makes you 2k a month and then you also give that bot to someone else, how can both make 2k a month exploiting the same opportunity?  It is a great idea but only makes sense as long as you as a team definitely follow up on that.  You are basically right about that, but the problem is how do you know that someone joining your network is a philanthropist?  And there is also much more resistance against the revolution than other online payment providers faced when they came up.  No questions need to be answered if they have been caught as cheaters. You want to trust them again after they apologized? You need to be out of your mind to do that.  These ideas where the network's coin should only serve as a currency to fund certain things don't work. You have to tie the currency into an ecosystem that represents a compelling use case. That way the coin has a tangible reason to exist.  The second point you mentioned is subject to a lot of different view points as well. While one might attest to you being able to apply theoretical knowledge in practice, others might not like the practice. The confusing thing in life is that practice constantly changes while theory often does not. Maybe scientific progress trails practical progress.  I can't even believe that you mean what you are saying. Lengthy, sure they are written with a lot of details because people ask for everything that's missing. This demand for pictures or videos attitude reminds me of children. If they write a 50 pages white paper you would rather neglect that and see a 2 minutes video and then pull the trigger for an investment?  You want to give away your wealth to others that's cool. What if someone among those using your bot is greedy? Is there anything you do to make sure that the right ones benefit from your altruism? If you don't, all your words are nothing but hot air. Run your bot, make a lot of money with it and donate it to people in need. Does that sound better to you? 
No issues here just letting the guys here know that anyone who is too lazy to read should just not be around in the ICO space. Everyone should be able to do some reading and if some are too lazy to do that I recommend they don't participate in this asset class.  If you had a bot that works reliably and increase your income steadily what is the idea to share it with others? You would be much smarter if you used it yourself. It would take you less than 5 seconds to find out that this currency should be used to support scientists.  And here the whole thing starts to become subject of endless discussion. What does high quality education look like? Some say it should be way more practice oriented and some say it is very important to be theory focussed to not let scientific progress slow down.  The more you want to invest in a project the more you should be motivated to study a project in full. That means have a look at and analyze all material you can find about it if you want to invest a lot. There is a start up if I remember that correctly that presents specific research causes (for example like the Dengue fever) and then anybody can contribute to support research. Sure why not have more than one project going this way, but do you expect a lot of parties in this network to be rather interested in personal profits than in supporting good causes? I feel you don't take me for real or maybe you doubt I am a wonderfully looking guy?   There are so many marketplaces getting launched do you think that there are even enough users in the world to satisfy all marketplaces? By now there could be one marketplace per user. And still more marketplaces are presented on this forum.  That's ridiculous since they could easily take the countdown down. This way it looks like they are real newbies. Oh and by the way: they probably are. Changing a small piece of the world means changing the world as it is not anymore what is had been before the change. The issue for me is that token holders shouldn't be top priority in charity. It is firstly about the causes you want to support.  This can be the reason why it pays off. When other people are lazy at doing something and you actually do the work, you can use that information to your advantage.  True and that means with 20 million coins you should receive a reward roughly every 24 hours.  This is good news! I am a wonderfully looking guy, should I sign up on your platform as soon as it is ready?   Can you elaborate quickly on what a "Digital IPO" is and how it is different from a classic ICO? Centralized donations can be ok, but it will take longer to gain trust in the community. In your early days they might be afraid to make any payments through centralized channels, but then it's not so much that they should be afraid of losing it. Excited to see what you have up your sleeves. I recommend you to read comments more carefully before you decide to take part in the discussion. Nobody said that the community supports the price or something. I said the money has to come from somewhere in order for the price to stay up. If there is no demand and no business, the price will drop easy. For causes like this the only thing that counts is that you ultimately change something in the world for the better. And please be gender neutral and support men on your platform as much as you support women!   It's a lottery process. Doing the maths and then expecting the reward on time is wrong. It could happen that even if you are supposed to get a reward twice a day, you get nothing for 3 days in a row. 
Great market in India with a huge crowd of blockchain technology enthusiasts!  Better do some good research if you want your investments to return some good cash in the future.  Still working on any advanced versions of this application or are you done with this undertaking?  The theory for Bitcoin being a CIA invention isn't too absurd and that is why Bitcoin could turn into a global threat as there is an unknown entity controlling such a large amount of BTC. The algorithmic matching engine is the heartbeat of any exchange and that can only be stress tested under real world conditions. That is also what most exchanges fail to build properly as it requires enormous expertise in this specific area of computer science.  If they support the price the money for that must come from somewhere and that means the support is dependent on the Ecommerce biz. Only possible to dream that way if you smoked a good amount of weed and took some of the good stuff that Escobar loved the most.   The evidence proven you mean the platform is already providing real logistic services? Hey Brad is the Neptune beta running? I thought about the content streamers and if you want to get them onboard, is the platform's content running on the blockchain or is the platform itself centralized? I didn't expect a cryptonight blockchain to be able to process as much data as is required for streaming. That would of course be the best case scenario for Membrana but we should keep in mind that those exchanges demand a lot of fees also.  TakeOff implies you have big plans!  Is the token exchange already under development or is that not a primary item on your roadmap?  It's still a long way to go before renewable energy can really cope with the worldwide energy demand we have in our heavily industrialized world.  Maybe you should at least have a little bit more basic info here to make it interesting to even join your discord channel? Why should someone join it now? Anything else would be ridiculous. What does he even mean by regulated? As if the team tries to tie the price of the token to a certain range by putting up buy and sell orders or what? Yo how is the Pablo Escobar project going?Â   Will there ever be an interview with the relative who allegedly is behind this project?  Is the cause of the bug actually identified and can it easily be removed to prevent that from happening again? What's the plan for having a new round of the ICO? Are you still working on a new version and will it be anytime soon? What are the next major milestones Triton is now aiming for? Is there anything to be expected in the near future? If the 40% for marketing equal $20 million, did they collect $50 million in total? That's like one of the most successful ICOs recently. Considering the missing activity here on this board and no response from the team yet it was probably a scam. 
How much did these guys raise in total? If the ICO is so lang ago and you have been left without an exchange that is awkward. Never good to exclude any groups so maybe engage the community and let them provide translations if they want it and need it.  there are so many things the crypto world needs to thrive and this might be something of all the ingredients so no bad choice maybe. Maybe it was too much work and the developer team decided to earn their money another way than using a bad ICO. It is over thanks god. He didn't even motivate the shit posters to spread there worthless sentences here all over the place. I don't understand why you are asking for a white paper and technical details...! Come on, this guy has a very detailed FAQ    I would like to know did anybody in this thread here read the book that Roberto Escobar allegedly wrote and is it worth reading or completely science fiction style?  Wow I completely overlooked this coin. When I read the headline I thought this is a copy of Electrum but Electra actually exists for quite a while. Will put some time into studying this coin. Everybody can declare profits and pay taxes accordingly. That's up to the user to fulfill the duties. As for the legal status, I think the number of countries completely forbidding cryptocurrencies to be used is relatively small.  If you do it manually we can come back by Christmas time and see if you are done  I think there are always people trying to sign up with multiple addresses, but that's how it is.  Why would you bring in your friends here? Who are your friends and why are they worth mentioning? I could tell you that my grandfather watches this project as well. Would you mind?   Oh now I understand. But there is already another platform doing something like Twitch or not? I am not sure but I think I came across one project some time ago. I might be mistaken though.  Ethereum has unprecedented networks to offer to any new ERC20 token being launched on its network. All dapps can integrate with each other and benefit from the service another project offers. Give it a few years and you will see what that means.  Most of them don't want to know the price of the token. If there were bounties or bonuses they want to dump as fast as they can.  Of course, how could the distribution work without an operational blockchain? It first needs to be rolled out before and tokens can be sent.  ... Seriously if you read masternode these days take your money and run as fast as you can. Simply don't touch it anymore, it is a scam 99%. And this dude will launch another one most likely within just a few days.  Are you talking about bounty? I have never heard about a "generosity" campaign. It is called bounty campaign for every single project I know of.  I know what you mean but that isn't always the case. Sometimes it's important to zoom out of your own desires and really try to find out what the masses might like. Wishes and preferences are very subjective and therefore don't have to represent what the majority might like. And it is definitely a possibility as those large companies like DHL are on the outlook for opportunities to get involved with blockchain technology. You know what would get me be most interested in the platform? If they constantly manage to bring in new users  Everyone benefits from a growing user base and the generated network effects. Bringing in new users means taking care of existing users, that's how I see it. 
Is this only about a digital currency that can be transferred back and forth by e-sports people or is it a platform that also providers a variety of services to the industry? 4.4 at ICO bench is a pretty good rating although potential investors should still do their own research. This doesn't mean that this automatically going to be a success. I have seen some weird ratings in the past from them as well.  Does that mean if someone is highly motivated and creates a thousand addresses that person might receive the majority of the network? You can't really blame them though for just being interested in trading. More often than not that also counts for the devs who push one coin after another out to the people. Is it because they want to make impact? Yes, but only for their own lives   Nobody is going to put that effort into it but maybe someone should prepare some statistics about the number of masternode coins launched and the number of projects still being actively developed. I am sure it's a number less than 10% thats still alive. What the heck is generosity? Did you participate in the bounty campaign and are you waiting for the payment? Then please say bounty distribution or whatever. But generosity, I haven't even heard about that or are you looking for charity type of payments? The problem I see with more and more POW coins is that the chance for all of them to survive diminishes drastically with every new coin as there are only so much resources in the world that can be spend on POW while that problem isn't so urgent with POS. There won't be many POW coins in the long run I believe. They will build that app with the ordinary customer in mind, I am sure about that. The ease of use will be essential for adoption.  The first thing I think about when I read Kingston is the RAM memory. What's the purpose of the name or did you just choose it because you think it sounds good? And it seems there are good reasons to forget about it again  There won't be active development for Electrum Dark anymore. I didn't know they met with DHL, but I also think it's not that easy to partner up with such a heavy weight from the logistics sector.  But you can't exchange them for other digital currencies at all? If it's an open blockchain how are you going to lock those tokens into your ecosystem? To me it looks like increasing the number of partnerships could be a key ingredient to the success of their platform. Getting some strong nodes on board as early as possible can help increase traffic a lot, which in turn fosters logistical efficiency. Even a project manager can only give you the same answer all day long. It seems like people like chatting a lot. Instead they should focus on the core fundamentals of a project and consider whether they think it's going to be big or not.  I like that marketing angle! I do hold some worthless bags, maybe you could provide me some marketing consulting service so I can get rid of them?   Don't be paranoid? You can rest assured that some of the best tech guys and scientists in the world build analytical tools for blockchain on behalf ofÂ  governments. Would they publicly announce that to give you a chance to prepare?Don't be naive. If you were able to check balances in the block explorer, experts could also run statistical analyses and find out which addresses might be connected or interact with each other. Not so nice from a privacy perspective! Are there any specific technologies coming to your mind that you would like to see integrated? As of now they have a good stack of technologies they are going to implement. What do you think is missing? Maybe it's not their priority right now, but I think in the long run it would make sense to make the security aspect easier to handle. And exactly because there is so much work to do for this coin we should let those part-time developers just do their job instead of chatting with us all day.
Do whatever you want. If you really think that disclosing the numbers of how the sale is going is too specific, then that's what you think. I don't care.  Â  I am not sure if I ever saw someone describing that a project is dead the way you just did it. In anus   Problem is if you store the password within your browser and for whatever reason your computer completely crashes, it could be gone.  I know from other coins and tokens that it could very well be another four weeks after payment that the exchanges manage to finally get the listing done.  You should better stop posting or people will start reporting you. Checking your post history shows that you just copy and paste your posts across different threads. Clear indication for a ban. I wouldn't say it is completely unique. There are a few dealing with leads and web marketing in the space. But LeadCoin has a good team which might be able to stand the competition. It has been quite some time now since you last announced that the dates for the Q1 presale will be published. Are you still planning to go for it or has this been put ad acta for now? I remember there was much more activity like three months ago but now it seems that this might have come to an end. Are there any updates to be expected? Curious what you are going to do with those huge bags of coins that you are soon going to hold of this? There just isn't much going on here because it has nothing to offer. It's actually the first time I hear a team saying that. Most of the time they say it's for strategic reasons, but legal obstacles haven't been on the list of excuses so far. Without disclosing numbers, would you mind mentioning those certain legal obstacles? There is a lot of work going on. If a community had to decide between frequent communication or frequent coding, I feel most of them would prefer frequent communication over frequent coding... We must hope so, but it is also possible that the market easily needs half a year or even more to get back on full steam.  What are the actual risks you are running into when trying to claim your Bitcoin Private with your private keys? Interestingly, there was also some scientist (can't remember the name) stating that POS Casper has fundamental flaws. I am sure they will make the transition very carefully and only after double checking any criticism from knowledgable exerts.  They only adjust the circulating supply if it is absolutely clear what the circulating supply is. All funds that are unlocked but could hit the market count like circulating supply these days.  I suppose there were others before you trying to scam someone from the channel and they took precautionary action. You are better off making your offer here.  I don't think the code can be too bad. It's obviously good enough for crypto people to entrust the network with $85 billion. And it's growing stronger everyday. Literally every new token is getting launched upon Ethereum, although that might change given the increasing competition.  The amount of total funds raised would be good to know, too. Only the number of people isn't too meaningful. And if you think it's better to extend the private sale, just go for it. Having an enriched product to show during the sale will certainly not hurt.  Isn't the only reason that you have zero transaction fees the fact that literally nobody uses your network? Bitcoin once had zero transaction fees but couldn't keep that because of its skyrocketing popularity. Currently any cryptocurrency would face rising tx fees if popularity went through the roof. How do you plan to become the cryptocurrency for e-sports? There are other projects building the whole infrastructure and ecosystem for the e-sports environment plus they have a native blockchain currency within their platform. Why would they be interested in integrating Triton?
First time I am really paying attention to this thread and the smart glasses as you describe them with all their features seem to be really cool stuff. Will be following this and would love to see a demonstration of your prototype towards the middle of this year. But that means that the vetting process will be very time consuming the more specific a certain skillset is. How large of a group do you think is necessary to have a decent decentralized verification procedure? And how would you bootstrap the process in the beginning when nobody is on your platform but someone got to decide whether or not a certain skillset is sufficient? Is there any way to know whether you guys are approaching your soft cap? Will you disclose some numbers after the end of the first phase? If XDAG was all about code that nobody else doesn't understand, it would mean that the code is most likely not that well written. Imagine Vitalik and his people wrote code that nobody understands. If these guys are good coders they won't only understand the current code base, but they would also be able to fix its flaws assuming that they are interested in putting in the effort. All forks are legit if they don't steal money with malicious wallets? What about forks that are only created by anonymous devs to dump their coins and run off? Sounds legit hm?  Did you just offer to sell some coins in their telegram channel and then they immediately banned you?  Tell that someone who is investing in traditional stocks  300% profit they have to wait 20 years! Not sure what to think of the massive drop in the block reward. Why not decrease it more gradually over time? Sounds like you have the perfect setup to mine the majority of the coins in the early beginning. Yeah you made a pre-announcement, but still... not optimal imo.  Is your decentralized marketplace similar to that of Bitbay or what are the main differences?  Sad this question might get lost so I repeat it here. An answer will be much appreciated.  You say your first currency basket will consist of 15 currencies plus 5% gold with everything being asset-backed. Who is taking care of the assets backing Globcoin? A central authority I presume? In essence you are building a platform that should enable globally distributed people to build homogeneous micro communities. Is that what it is about? I think I can grasp your concept and all the new crypto concepts right now become more and more, well, very deep in scope and implications. That counts for yours as well but I like it. Why did you go for the name electrum dark? It implies that you are dealing with light clients like the electrum wallet.   Maybe I misunderstood it but you are working on atomic swaps or not? Can I trade any cryptocurrency back and forth using your exchange or what are the technological limitations? I completely agree with you I am just tired of people who are only talking about the red numbers and their losses. That is why I now picked one that is definitely green and meant some gains for others. Daily updates? Dude we are in software development and not in the news publishing business. You didn't invest in a newspaper but in a highly risky software project. You are right that there could be more communication, but the things you ask for basically don't help anyone. Should they tell you the same stuff day in and day out and spend their time on writing updates? Or should they try to develop what you invested money into?  I have always trouble believing that the ruling from a not publicly acknowledged law enforcement institution can have the final say over contractual relationships. Or are you accredited in any way (or those FinaCom experts)? And most of them charge a fee anyway so you would have to pay that first or to which exchanges did they reach out? Well patience is one key but another important key is to do proper research on the projects you want become part of. Many people just throw their money blindly at any hyped coin or token.  Is this airdrop based on a snapshot at a specific date or do we have to register for it? 
Are there possible scenarios where a dispute might not be easily solvable? Or can you as intermediaries always might the right final decision? That's complete nonsense. Why should the dev team put up money for buy support to help you being able to dump your coins? The dev team can help by creating demand through great development, that's their job.  Many people complaining but we are up 80% or so since beginning of November in $ terms. There are worse things than being up 80% within just 3 weeks. I know we lost a lot of value before that but there is much more room for price increases and they will come.  Absolutely and I also place some buy orders for the cheap coins from bounty dumpers. Why do you think that? Because you doubt that there is huge demand for the coin. And that is a bad indicator for the coin in general. The bounties shouldn't make much of a difference for a coin that is in high demand.  Hm ok if you want to be super precise you are probably right. Everyone thought gold will be the physical asset king forever and now there is Bitcoin!  Let's see whatÂ  is going to dethrone Bitcoin and when that is going to happen. Stratis?   Sure totally makes sense. I just remember those days where I wished Bittrex was would have been aware of the identity of a developer you know  And then they said they are not and nobody can be blamed in the end.  Creating a truly decentralized exchange is technically very challenging, though not impossible. It's about engineering, but we are yet waiting for a amor breakthrough in regards to a fully functional, highly scalable decentralized exchange. That is why I asked you whether there are centralized elements included in the design of your exchange. I think that super serious coins wouldn't aim at Yobit being the first exchange. So I am always quite a bit more cautious when I see a team approaching Yobit first. Chances are quite high that Yobit themselves are developing shit coins or at least cooperate wth shitcoin developers. That's a matter of fact.  Fully decentralized exchange? How many assets are currently traded on it and is it operating with gateways or is it truly decentralized? I doubt you pulled off what is one of the hardest nuts to crack in crypto.  Do developers these days have to reveal their identity to Bittrex in order for their coin to get listed? I missed that if it is the case.  And once again Stratis is suffering from the Bitcoin increase. I think we shouldn't even argue the Bitcoin is and will remain the real cryptocurrency king, probably forever.  Of course it does when you have an extremely great product or project the few bounties won't make a difference against the huge demand the great product entails. It's all about building good stuff and getting the message out to the masses. I hope ATLANT will do exactly that.  Hey bonanzacoin how about you just close this thread so people don't even waste their time to click on this? Let's keep this place as tidy as possible.  It seems this has already been abandoned. So not sure how beneficial it would be for you to provide you with info about Bitcoin Blue... True, maybe they can comment on it. Although Changelly doesn't mean that much to be honest. I don't think it would help ATLANT much. So did they just delay it for an uncertain time? That means another endless rollercoaster ahead - STRATIS included. The miner will visit you at home and ask for a cash reimbursement.  Is Zoin a direct competitor of XZC? Or is there anything you guys are doing differently in regards to the technology?
You sound like you had too much alcohol or drugs. I like the route you guys are taking because you create some scarcity for the coin. It's a good sign to investors!  Not really any news I would say. Bitcoin dominance in insane by now but it's justified I think. Stratis is about to increase a lot very soon imo.  I know but it does not change the fact that volume is still pretty low and leads to the problem I described in my last post.   It could be a scam of course but it could also be just abandoned. Don't send funds to any address and you are fine.  Hm constantly dropping towards new lows. I hope this stops because the way for price recovery only gets longer right nowÂ   Still believing in the fundamentals though. You are making good points here and I am not saying that other systems don't have any degree of centralization. But we all know that centralization is often being abused even these days. Sometimes, however, it is a stage a project has to go through when transitioning from a centralized system to a decentralized system. That's why I suggested to go an oracle route one day, by which I mean some time in the future.  Well I wouldn't say that there is lots of liquidity. It is pretty modest thus far. But I agree with you it's going to change very soon and I am sure there will be much more volume. Right now we are still below $100k which is not so great. Maybe this is one of those projects which come to an end before they even began to develop. Anyone still interested in this? True, the team is on point and delivering. Hopefully $1 soon! Â   But with the growth of such platform comes a lot of power that could be abused. For example, if you pay technical experts to make investment decisions for you, they would have a lot of incentive to front-run the whole operation. Any degree of centralization in such a business is dangerous and that is why oracles operating on AI would be worth a try one day (when they are sophisticated enough).  Which is logical because you neither can get into the project at a stable price without pushing the whole market with a few bucks nor can you get out of the project without crashing the market and losing out big time.  Read a few posts above what he answered me. I think this is a fun project and nothing more and he is honest about it. Wouldn't expect too much here.  I hope you didn't follow your gut when you made that post... I would say now is a good price point to get into the project but the dump was real.  Sounds about right what you say. I think $1.00 from now is about 8x and it's very possible if they keep working hard. Will be a fun road ahead of us. I know, and I got you!  And I found it very funny, too!  How does the market analysis work, like, who is it who does that? Do oracles play a role here? Jesus, those are really some impressive facts and that speaks volumes in favor of the project. It's probably almost a must to keep an eye on this.  Well liquidity isn't everything you say but I tend to disagree. Liquidity is extremely important to make the token be an attractive investment. Without a decent exit option nobody would really consider to put money into the project.  :d we all know what he means but it is indeed a very funny way to misspell crypto wallet  What was the hard cap and how quickly were all tokens sold out?  What exactly du you mean by that or to what are you referring specifically?
You are at least completely honest  It would be a great surprise, however, if you publish a monster road map the next dew days   Ok and are there any reports thus far abut how the testing is going and whether any major bug has been found / fixed? Sounds good. Definitely an urgently needed update.  Yes that sounds quite solid. I hate those one man shows where you are completely dependent on a single developer. Excited about ZOIN future. They are only safe on exchanges until the point in time when they are not anymore. In other words, things can go fast as we have seen in the past and your coins are gone. Even licensed exchanges can get into trouble / be hacked / whatever. See Cryptsy...  Hehe oh yeah! Dreaming to have such a great party soon?   When will the Breeze Wallet be operational? Is there any connection to the network?

Um i found an exploit a while ago I was temped to share it and get it patched but didn't know if i was gonna make any money.So instead a used it to view kibas art for free and other files I did not deface or stop the server from working. After the trade of ownership someone else found the same exploit using g00nshell under the name of c.php I deleted it and secured the site on that part. Since then i have only used it to creep on kibas art without paying and actually keep the site safe. Its a small forum.Most people aren't looking for a to-do list that they have to pay for.You should advertise maybe? If its block we will just encrypt all the data it might slow down the actual transaction a bit but still be working. Unless they block all encrypted data then god save us all. What if the pool operator steals every 10th hash for himself? WHAT IF...the Illuminati cracked SHA256 and all other encryption and invented bitcoin so everyone uses it. Then they crack all our keys and pwn us. Me and it seems there are several others in the channel. A cartoon minimalistic cat using a clever way like tying balloons onto itself to chase some birds. IRC this one? TITS or GTFO Toronto area
Any one want these ill be giving them to non bitcoin users soon. canada anytime soon? Alright thanks a ton. Run a really long ethernet cable between the two planets. Store the wallet key offline don't ever connect it to the computer. Make new wallets transfer the amount you need then use that to send to the internet. Like that if a hacker acts really fast at most they steal one payment. they are not spent but bitcoin claims they are thus it wont let you spend them again so they are in limbo The payment maybe did not make it into a block before being backed up. When you restored your old copy Bitcoin assumes its already pushed out to the network and stops sending it out therfore your payment is never made?This is a conclusion that I'm thinking of and it seems it causes bitcoins to be stuck in limbo. I have many games from way before 2000 like early 1990s, how much for one game and who pays for shipping. I think you want more confirmations for that you need blocks to be generated after the last transaction let it sit overnight then post back your results.

One day bitcoins will be worth 1000 dollars each. Then they can cry that they don't have any and they don't wanna work or do things to get some. Till then I hope these idiots don't dry up the faucet and delete their wallet.dat.

retailmenot.com + firefox Icelandic Commonwealth (930Â1262)Classical ("Thing system") Iceland (also called the Icelandic Commonwealth or the Icelandic Free State) was an example of society where police and justice were guaranteed through a free market. This Icelandic "Thing system" survived for several centuries. It was eventually destroyed by the Christian church, which bought up all the godards (defense agencies) creating a state monopoly.PWNED BY CHURCH Libertatia (1670sÂ1690s)Libertatia was a legendary free colony forged by pirates and the pirate Captain Misson, although some historians have expressed doubts over its existence outside of literature. Historian and activist Marcus Rediker describes the pirates as follows:These pirates who settled in Libertalia would be "vigilant Guardians of the People's Rights and Liberties"; they would stand as "Barriers against the Rich and Powerful" of their day. By waging war on behalf of "the Oppressed" against the "Oppressors," they would see that "Justice was equally distributed."[11]The pirates were against the various forms of authoritarian social constructs of their day, monarchies, slavery, and capital. The pirates practiced forms of direct democracy, where the people as a whole held the authority to make laws and rules, and used systems of councils with delegates, who were supposed to think of themselves as "comerads" of the general population, and not rulers. The pirates created a new language for their colony and operated a socialist economy.MIGHT HAVE HAPPENEDFree Territory (Ukraine) (1918-1921)In March 1918, Russia (led by the Bolsheviks), the Ukrainian People's Republic, and the Central Powers, signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk to pull Russia out of World War I. The Treaty resulted in the occupation of the territory of the weak Ukrainian state by the German and Austro-Hungarian empires. This was done without consulting Ukrainian population. Various insurgence groups arose, including the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, led by the anarcho-communist Nestor Makhno. They won popular support due to their attacks on the Austro-Hungarian puppet-leader Hetman Skoropadsky and the Nationalist Petliurists.Although the movement was forced to spend great energy and resources to fight off the invaders, they still managed to carry out a social revolution according to the principles of anarchism.The Makhnovist movement was quite a threat to the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks clung to the idea that the ÂmassesÂ were unable to carry out a social revolution on their own and perform self-management. This was proven wrong by the Makhnovist movement, prompting Bolshevik attacks. Even in the military area it seemed that the anarchist answer was superior. The Makhnovists defeated on several occasions armies up to 30 times their size, and had great morale.LATER PWNED BY OUTSIDE FORCEAutonomous Shinmin region (1929Â1932)The apex of Korean anarchism came in late 1929 outside the actual borders of the country, in Manchuria. Over two million Korean immigrants lived in Manchuria at the time when the Korean Anarchist Communist Federation (KACF) declared the Shinmin province autonomous and under the administration of the Korean PeopleÂs Association. The decentralized, federative structure the association adopted consisted of village councils, district councils and area councils, all of which operated in a cooperative manner to deal with agriculture, education, finance and other vital issues. An Army to fight for the defense of Shinmin was also set up and spearheaded by the prominent Korean Anarchist Kim Jwa-jin which had great successes against the Imperial Japanese Army and the Bolshevik Red Army, using hit-and-run guerrilla tactics. KACF sections in China, Korea, Japan and elsewhere devoted all their energies towards the success of the Shinmin Rebellion, most of them actually relocating there. Dealing simultaneously with the Soviet Union's attempts to overthrow the Shinmin autonomous region and JapanÂs imperialist attempts to claim the region for itself, the Korean anarchists had been crushed by 1932LATER PWNED BY OUTSIDE FORCESpanish Revolution (1936Â1938)Much of Spain's economy was put under direct worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Socialist influence. Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivized and run as libertarian communes. Even places like hotels, barber shops, and restaurants were collectivized and managed by their workers.The communes were run according to the basic principle of "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need", without any Marxist dogma attached. In some places, money was entirely eliminated. Despite the critics clamoring for maximum efficiency, anarchic communes often produced more than before the collectivization. The newly liberated zones worked on entirely egalitarian principles; decisions were made through councils of ordinary citizens without any sort of bureaucracy.PWNED BY OUTSIDE MILITARYHungarian Revolution (1956)The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 can be seen as an excellent example of a functioning anarchy. From October 22, 1956, Hungarian workers refused to obey their managers or their government, in the face of authoritarian soviet rule. Claiming sovereignty for their own workers' councils they organized economic, military and social production on an increasing scale. An example of the anarchic social organization was that vast sums of money were freely donated for injured revolutionary fighters, and that this money was left unattended in the street for days at a time. Peasants supplied the workers with food on a voluntary basis. Between October 22 and December 14 Hungary's economy and society was governed by the democratic opinion of workers councils and voluntary associations.PWNED BY SOVIETSFreetown Christiania (1971Âpresent)Christiania was founded in 1971, when a group of hippie squatters occupied an abandoned military barracks in Copenhagen, Denmark. One of the more influential people involved was Jacob Ludvigsen, who published an anarchist newspaper which widely proclaimed the establishment of the free town. The people of Christiania developed their own set of rulesÂindependent of the Danish governmentÂwhich include the prohibition of cars, stealing, guns, bulletproof vests and hard drugs. Cameras are not allowed, and locals will wave their hands and shout "No photo!" if they see a picture being taken. Famous for its main drag, known as "Pusher Street" as hash was sold openly from permanent stands until 2004. Such commerce is controversial, but cannot be removed without complete community consensus. For years the legal status of the region was in limbo, as the Danish government attempted, without success, to remove the squatters.STILL UP MAY NOT BE PERFECTZapatista Autonomous Municipalities (1994-present)The indigenous peoples of Southern Mexico rebelled in 1994, partially in response to the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), reclaiming their lands in what is called "a war against oblivion".Laws in the Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities are not passed by "leaders", as such, but by "Good Government Councils" and by the will of the people (representatives in these councils are truly representative of their communities, rather than professional politicians). This is very similar to the delegate structure that many anarchists engage in with spokescouncils, or with unions. In many communities, general assemblies gather during the week to decide on various things facing the community. The assemblies are open to all, with no formal hierarchy. The decisions made by the communities are passed to elected delegates whose only job is to give the decided upon information to a council of delegates.[clarification needed] Like anarcho-syndicalist organizations, the delegates are recallable, and are also rotated. This way, massive numbers of people are able to decide things with no formal hierarchy, and without people speaking for them.SOME AREAS TAKEN BACK BY MILITARY STILL UPINTERNET EXAMPLESAspects of the Free Software community, like the Free Software movement, the GNU Project and its copyleft principle are a type of a gift economy for information and software; a gift economy is the preferred economic system of anarcho-communists.[67] Programmers make the source code of their programs available for anyone to copy, modify and improve. Individual programmers gain prestige and respect, and the community benefits from better software. Markus Giesler, in his ethnography Consumer Gift Systems, explored music downloading as a system of social solidarity based on gift transactions.[68][69] Some organizations such as online commons (such as the Wikimedia Commons), wikis and Indymedia are held up as examples of functioning anarcho-communistic organizations.DONT REALLY COUNT BUT...Stuff in bold is how it got crushed, as you can see non fell apart from the inside due to murder or violence, I don't count Somalia as a anarchy due to it being run by unofficial governments like the crime gangs financed by the USgov, there where a short period at the beginning where it improved the region compared to the rest of South Africa. Keep it standard this is a currency system not something else, sure its cool when you find modifications of presidents on a 5 dollar bill, but is it worth raising the costs of sending money. Is one of the main points behind bitcoins that like cash its FREE to use and trade. I'm willing to seed wallets at 1 bitcoin a month. for more then one IP ill make a deal at 2bitcoins a month 3 IPs per wallet file.Almost any other data at 100 MB for 1 bitcoin a month x IP.Prices will change to respond to the market or as demand increases/decreases. I think the term is anarcha-capitalists. Freenet but because its unmeasurable its untraceable. Btw what up with the bitcoin logo and its messed up boxes on it. When you scan do you do digital touch ups or not really? Would a normal CDN network work just use lots of peoples home computers for this.Or just pay to seed using a torrent client maybe someone could code one that has bitcoin stats running directly from it I looked at one of the older ones, and will you be coloring it later so far its quite good. And its the forum birthday Hooray What about attacks using this system with the normal system trust is needed here you have a false trust that will lock up bitcoins forever. I have updated and am on the new server but even after generating for 3 minuits it says Address XXXXXXXXXXX not found in block being solved. why? It doesnt matter they claim its too slow to move big amounts of money and might use it when its more official and not just a test project.Sorry for trying to do something.I asked them when there was no public outcry yet. Then kiba and the rest posted how its a bad idea since then i have not talked to them. once i read satoshi's post, I checked irc and talked about the status of it being implemented and they claim its not good enought to actually profit them. The wikileaks board of directors has 10 members + JA, then there are about 150~200 staff, and under that are 1400 volunteers. Its seems all you want is your business to not be taxed that we will be free if we have competition and all that.This is not an issue of rightwing vs leftwing.Its an issue of freedom of press and the fact they need a anonymous network of donations.I bet you don't ever see the oppression around society and decide to go out and do some direct action. Like in the case of the ashvi11e eleven or oscar grant. Instead you want to have more money and create the perfect economy. For revolution we need social change before economic. Wikileaks can be the first step to achieving this against the government. That's why I'm deciding to contact and explain to them the benefits of bitcoin. em3rgent orderI'm just checking up getting the userbase on board with the idea. Trying to see if anyone else thinks its a possible good way to get donations on there site without having things shut down, same as the bitDNS project if we code it and wikileaks uses it will we all pussy out as they are deemed a terrorist organization? With paypal down I'm increasing my pressure upon their board of directors to get a bitcoin address up. Just stick to shorter answers next time like You do the people. then we would ask how. then you explain keep it more step by step. You would get 2 transaction with the value of 266khash at time of generation. For a /b/ mask wearing avatar you seem weak in your soul destroying ways.Whats worse then 10 babies in a dumpster.1 baby in 10 dumpsters. vistafag here /â/ looks like a good idea. My vote goes to it
Its like bitcoins but time based old domains get freed up after 365 days, if you want to keep it just send it to someone or to yourself. Pay it forward is like laundering your money eh why not.1HAKFLsiWw2AmPZZsFQk7Y96uqUtmKgR4U grondilu Your response made me smile got an address. Whats the hardest thing about walking in a fields of dead babies.Your penis.Use my forum address. Yes, sorry my spell-check didn't pick that up. Dont send the 800 at once break it up to smaller but more frequent donations. Assuming blocks are generated roughly every ten minuets what I can do is generate a block by myself for the full 50 BTC for about 9 minuets then hop on to the server and pump a fast hash rate the server will calculate that I should get some bitcoins even tho I have not helped out a lot. If you count Hashes that are sent it will fix this. Also if some one disconnects 10 seconds before the block is found and they where the leading hash speed they get nothing and everyone else gets a lot more then they should. zazzle is overly expansive. Make your own silkscreen and mass print them and sell for bitcoins. Is the other one not flawed then Assuming each block is generated every 10 minuets can I not connect a lot of C/GPU power for the final minuet and get a bigger share ever tho I did little work. Or all domains expire yearly and will need to be regenerated, but if you send it to yourself before it ends you get to keep it. Like this we fix the issue of lost domains and allow dropping old names for free. Make sure to do that for the error logs too not only the access logs. From my idea of an anarchocommunistSome one has to pay for the roads the people that pay should create local rules. Its this road feels like then need seatbelts due to the amouth of cars they will have them. Also taxi with seatbelts will have more customers so they will want to have seatbelts.People arent evil, they will respect you and maybe have smoking room.If its an communistic anarchy there is no cash or class so whoever discovers the vaccine will give it out for free. Also people that dont partake in the communist areas will not get vaccination areas can trade goods to get it for themselves if they want it.Hope this shows a point. Once again this is how i would solve them it maybe THAT STUPID not everyone is that nice. People are born evil. BUT I HOPE THOSE people answer his question and not my answers. not that bad. So the IP/domain is coded into the client and government takes out the domain and IP. What do until next update?before you say opensource. How many people edit there actual opensource apps like firefox and gimp. over 85 clients and 60000 khash w00t. As part of the official Fully p2p anonymous client.Who will run the server what if the server goes down.Until a p2p pooled miner is out this is asking for trouble. It would be awesome. This wont work as pooled mining needs a server. central server. we need a p2p miner done. Talk to one of the members on the board of directors who has met with Julian he said he likes the idea and will pass it around. BUGIf I close all my miners and restart them I lose all the Coins from the current Block that i should have received. Maybe use a table or array to store address in memory so people on the go can use it or even if there internet goes out.
I find the idea of your Bitcoin Phone book cool but take into account some people split up different addresses for different forums/communities. Freenet. I find tieing in bitcoins to DNS retarded. There are already some other p2p DNS systems that need help lifting off the ground why make a new one.http://dot-p2p.org/index.php?title=Main_Pagehttp://wiki.opennicproject.org/dotP2PTLD He may live in Netherlands and be unaffected by certain drug laws. Satoshi probably has a fetish for the mystery we make about him. FineSpanish Civil War. They want you to take out loans fail and become a wage slave. Can someone edit the first post to include the server IP so we can all join in this.Also if the IP owner doesn't want to keep running it I will see if I can take over. Does This app work with domains instead of IPs? Err Huge protest in Greece in 2008. Huge protest now in UK over the student cuts. I think they know its a majority and also the France strikes were pretty popular. Your minority government cover up idea is not real. But in theory assuming the current difficulty does not rise.50 bitcoins are generated per block for now. If your going at 1000khash and it takes 1 month to get the coins this sucks.Meanwhile, someone going at 4000khash will make 4 blocks before you make one. So 5 blocks have been made in one month and you have 50 bitcoins and your GPU nemesis has 200 bitcoins. If you use correct pooling that measures not speed at generation but how many hashes generated. After one week you may not find the winning hash but GPU will. You get 10 bitcoin he gets the other 40. After the month has ended and you and him generate 5 blocks together. You will still have 50 bitcoins and he will have his 200.All this does is divide the way bitcoins are generated to a quicker approach. A weak machine will only get its fair 50 after the time it would normally take to generate a coin. If every last bitcoin user joined in on a network bitcoins would tick in at a and even rate still giving GPU and server farms more coins then the rest but allowing CPU users to get a bit of coins before they die.I truly hope there wont be a competition with the pooled mining teams and that the server doesn't start taking fees. I will take the pledge expect for the cash exchange part as I wish to remain a bit more anonymous. correct make sure to move it not delete it And teens don't care about terms like those back to the topic.Some one needs to set up a weed4bitcoin and booze4bitcoin. http://www.politicalcompass.org/ Make a new wallet, send coins to it, then pass that wallet file onwards. They run there own anonymous IRC server.chat.wikileaks.org port 9999 i think or the secure one. I have some of the staff on IRC. So he is a romantic. Possible to get a custom amount done as I need 25.81 USD on a Visa card and I don't want to pay for 50 USD. Heavy Capitalist With a good chuck of lefties not many in the middle it will be a clear divide.
When I got on at the beginning there was 2 others plus my two at around 2500khash then i later saw 6 at 3500khash and even 10 at 6000khash. Right now its 2 at 800 (only me). But how many faucet visitor can there be each time it seems that each 10 minutes someone gets 0.5 bitcoins. http://blockexplorer.com/address/1GDLG7N5aJ7v5HoEGTFwYNQnwyQgfpppMUTraced it to here the i lost the trail http://blockexplorer.com/address/1HjUPLEnFmWEQacwWCM7HiyME2ZWcZJmhySeems that the money keeps getting 0.5 bitcoins the amount the faucet gives out. Lets trace who it is. I'm assuming the user is using proxys. Smart teen hang out on hacker forums and tech blogs or they find there way here like me.Stay away from skiddies as they will start scams then forget about bitcoin and lose that money forever. You can't just make TLDs unless you use a pseudo TLD like .onion or .i2p new ones are being made at ICANN but its a long process .xxx is taking years and is really controversial. You guys say its split based on the rate. Will this not mean if I have connect and disconnect a lot with my super mega fast client I get more then a non stop small guy. It should be done by the amount of hashes you computed to the amount it too to solve the block. Okay got it runningOS Vista Fully patchedRam 2.5GBCPU Intel Centrino 2 Dual Core DuoNormally I get 800~1200 khash/sbut with this I get around 300,333,366,400,433 I'm assuming thats the weird way it shows speed.I noticed that it uses one core only can this be fixed.So I'm running 2 at a time to make up for that both at around 366+ this still adds up to the lower estimates of the normal client.Will this work on guest accounts then I could run it at school.Also how is the 50 BC split now. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPLthat is all I'm going to go online tonight and talk to some Wikileaks staff see if they can start the ball rolling on the insides. I'm a bit more then just a socialist and I know bitcoin is a step towards getting away from government/corporation authority and control. After that it will help move into a classless society and possibly money will be abolished altogether. Do not forget all the blizzard games and updates also, twitter updates it server farms using bittorrent. Does it not seem that only crazy people believe in things like love? What is the IP?I just really hope no one from the forums decides to start making teams and starts splitting up generation that would ruin the point of this. Is Tor2Web a university service that may cause a lot of discussion maybe even some good protests. Register your domain outside of the states or use Tor links/ Freenet sites / use a dynamic DNS. I'm down for joining this any one got a good tutorial to set this up on a windows PC.

Can we stay on topic and post related to invites not the ideas of copyrights. ........... Sure seems fair its better then waiting 1 year for 50 bitcoin.

So I was gonna look at normal stores if they sell the same brand or from the same company. southord.com << intrested in buying some items for Christmas Is there a brand name? or company name? In the spirit of anarchism (communistic or capitalistic) time to place these on cars parked around government buildings. Or we can add another block so IPs are now XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX making it have 255 times more exponents.  But can the iron boots not trample the snake. Whats the brand name? http://fivegrinder.com/ I assume he means the send to IP option. I'm not sure yet try it out with 0.01 bitcoin and your own domain.Domains do not look at UPPERcase and lowercase, but the app might. Maybe we can just add a quick ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO SEND MONEY HERE prompt before sending them. The Russian ads lie. Can you release them as a SVG file please. What kind of capitalists invade a thread to insult someone.
