Well that's great to see that forum members have provided a way to view the site easily on mobile.  The bitcointalkmobile.appspot site seems to work on iOS's Safari, but the bitcointalk app for iOS shows as unavailable in the US. The android app "BitcoinTalk.org Forum" is still available on the play store.The current forum software is very functional on the desktop, no complaints there.  I will still be excited to see what the admins can cook up for us. I would like the bitcointalk forum to be more mobile friendly and accessible through the Tapatalk app.  The last response I found on the subject is quoted below.Plugin Download Page: http://tapatalk.com/activate_tapatalk.php?plugin=smf The whole ppcoin.org site doesn't seem to exist anymore, much less a faucet.  Hello BitcoinTalk,  I'm here to learn more about bitcoin and other alternate cryptocurrencies.   Glad there are some posting restrictions to make me go through and read up on what the general rules and etiquette is around here.
