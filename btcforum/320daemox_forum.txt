Thanks for the prompt (and concise) replies. I am currently re-testing, and I caught one mistake I made. I was originally running Bitcoin as root. I am currently re-testing sans the root and the unresponsive system issues hasn't re-manifested itself.I'm going to give the wiki a read and learn more about this setup (like where I can use this), but so far so good.Cheers,daemox Hello,I'm interested in Bitcoin, but while generating coins it rendered my system pretty much unusable (system became very unresponsive, even after manually adjusting Bitcoin's priority down).If there are any suggestions for getting Bitcoin to function better I'd love to hear them.Thank you,daemox
