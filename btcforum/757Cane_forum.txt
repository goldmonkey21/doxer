I like the idea of Bitcoin, with one exception... that the resources could be used for grater good, instead of wasting them. How about making "valuable" calculations, instead of calculations, for calculations sake?What I am talking about is modifying the BOINC client (http://boinc.berkeley.edu/) and getting Bitcoins for generated work on finding a cure for cancer or some other project.
