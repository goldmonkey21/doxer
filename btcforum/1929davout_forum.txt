Electrum simply is the best wallet out there. Ben oui, tu risques pas d'acheter à un cours imaginaire.Et par définition, le cours auquel tu achètes devient le cours du marché. For free obviously. First of all, the prices can start diverging before the fork actually happens. The economic resolution will probably not need an actual fork to happen.In addition to that, even if only 25% of miners remain on bitcoin at first, there will still be one block every 40 minutes, and one block every 13 minutes and 20 seconds on the 75% chain which seems more than enough to get some trading going on.Now, in addition to this, you could perfectly imagine that some miners decided to broadcast v4-tagged blocks before the fork, for the sole purpose of inflating the gavincoin/bitcoin rate, with no intention of actually honoring the hard-fork. By doing this they would lead unsuspecting bagholders to sell more bitcoin for gavincoin than they would have otherwise. If this happens, god help you, you'll think you'll have 75% of the miner support, but when the hard fork comes you'll find all this hashrate disappearing from under your feet and supporting the other chain... "We heard you like market manipulation, so we put some market manipulation in your market manipulation..." No probs! Let's assume the prices of bitcoin and gavincoin diverge because of the shorting and that you can sell one bitcoin for two gavincoins.If you support the original bitcoin you'll mine on the original chain.Now if you think gavincoin will prevail, it's still more profitable to mine on the original chain, because whatever you mine, it will ultimately yield two gavincoins for every original bitcoin you mine.And obviously, by doing so you're strengthening bitcoin at the expense of gavincoin. The value of a coin attracts mining, which in turns increases the value of this coin against the other. Why not ? Some people, I am among them, are of the opinion that this fork is unneeded, "solves" a problem that does not exist, and has the potential to harm Bitcoin in the long run. His math is correct though, if you have 60% X and 20% Y then you have a 3-to-1 ratio  We met IRL in 2011, you have all the data to figure this one out :-)And how's convincing core devs going? Any luck convincing anyone else than Hearn?That's irrelevant, travel to Greece, ask around if the ECB should print more Euros.Just because a lot of people think X doesn't make X correct.No probs, the faster you publish your altcoin's specs, the faster we'll be able to draft contracts allowing the market to short it into the ground.I don't think it's such a bad thing if frivolous transactions are discouraged from being burdened onto every full node's hard-drive.I disagree with you, so I'm a troll... Is gmaxwell also a troll?Am I missing something? Not really, AFAIK he didn't post anything.If you want to hear his stance why don't you just hop on IRC and ask him directly? I said "it doesn't need fixing". I didn't say "it'll never need fixing".Your reading skills, they do need fixing. Looks like you missed it the first time it was posted: http://fr.anco.is/2015/gavineries/Does Bitcoin not work for you?Most users don't really care, they'll transact off-chain if it's more convenient. Users that have enough money that justifies taking the paranoid road will always have either enough money to cover the fees, or wait for some space in a block.That's why intellectually honest people give you the sources of their quotes, so you can research relevant context if so inclined.The reason I didn't quote Hearn is that the point he makes is pretty retarded. Bitcoin won't crash and burn because mempools increase, it's trivial for miners to drop transactions they don't care about, and merchants should not rely on 0-confs anyway.Also allow me to highlight some interesting bit in Hearn's post:This is a fucking *feature*, if someone pushes for a change, despite being told that it's risky by intelligent people, and fuck up, of fucking course they should lose influence. What would the alternative be? "O, you broke this system despite being told your idea was stupid, please have some more influence" ? Gavin gets it wrong. Big deal.You know, there's a reason in business, why it's usually not the code-monkeys who get to make strategic decisions.Maybe if you actually phrased it like a question it'd be easier to answer.And it would certainly be easier for the one who answers to show that the assumptions the question is based on, are flawed. Could you please quote other core devs saying they OK this ?Here is mine :Source. Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn are sold, others are like 'meh'. To date, lightning is vaporware, let's see when it's actually rolled-out.Why do you speak in the future tense, Bitcoin already works fine on a basic internet package. That doesn't make much sense...But hey, if you feel like avoiding answering the question of what the trade-off of a bigger chain is, I can't really force you. Because micro-channels are only for recurring micro-payments that can be aggregated to a bigger one later. It's a small subset of micro-payments, certainly not the general case.Now if you'd please answer the original question. Sure, so what's the trade-off for allowing micropayments and reddit's tipping on the primary chain?
Which ones? The point is that you do not need, and should not need, a dedicated high-end server.If you can run it on a smartphone, even if you shouldn't, indicates you can easily run it on any desktop PC.This point works equally well with Open Office. And an office suite *is* designed to be as easy to use as possible. Except you can.The same is true of technical skill, most people in the world are hardly technically literate enough to run MS Word. Andreas is a fucktard. And the "programmable money" thing is a marketing gimmick that reddit likes to repeat ad nauseam. You can't. Because you cannot taint an unspent output I own, you sure can create an output that is spendable by one of my addresses, but you can't alter any of the outputs I can spend. Nothing forces me to mix your tainted output with my clean ones when I create a transaction.This is so braindamaged I don't even know where to start. Blending a pound of feces with a pound of pasta doesn't give you a kilogram of anything remotely edible.What do you expect will come out of these mixers? Whitelisted coins?So, how would you actually, in practice, create such a, ahem, "smart contract" ? Yea, I was about to point out that v3 blocks are a soft fork. Thanks for the write up though.Deposit one pre-fork BTC, you get credited one post-fork BTC and one gavincoin that you can trade against each other.Before the fork you withdraw one BTC if you have one post-fork BTC and one gavincoin in your account, after the fork you can withdraw them separately.If the fork doesn't happen before a certain pre-defined block height all gavincoins in your account are invalidated and you can withdraw post-fork BTC you have in your account as regular BTC. I can guarantee you that it will exist, long before the fork even happens. How about a miner, or a group of miners, broadcast v4 blocks, or even go as far as actually playing along with the fork, for the sole purpose of artificially inflating the exchange rate of gavincoin?For an actor, or a group, with a reasonable chunk of hashpower, that would be a pretty efficient way to manipulate the cross-chain market and make a killing in the process. Miners follow the money. If doing what they're told is a net profit then they will follow.So it's ok if some unrelated party decides whether you get to spend your own money ?So it's also ok if someone decides to prevent you from transacting because your coins have a history that you may or may not be responsible for ? Why do you think it isn't a good thing that miners mine anonymously? (Not implying that Tor is safe btw)Do you not think it makes Bitcoin more censorship-resistant?Do you remember the aborted CoinValidation startup? (The one that basically wanted to make a business of destroying Bitcoin's fungibility by wanting to blacklist certain categories of coins on opaque criteria)Do you think it is good that miners are only a handful of identified entities that governments can pressure to refuse to process transactions on criteria other than economic ones? I think you misunderstand.I don't really care for this point about Tor myself, but from what I understand it's not that *users* should be able to hide behind Tor, what is being argued is that *miners* should be able to do so. And the argument is that it becomes much more difficult with a bigger block size. I concur, but it's equally silly to use this as a basis to extrapolate. What do we know? Maybe the average internet connection speed increase will slow down over the years? Maybe internet providers won't have a big incentive to keep the speeds increasing more and more? Thing is we don't know. It really can't hurt to wait for something to become real before actually starting to rely on it becoming real as a condition for a system to work, isn't it ?I'd say yes, but I'd also add the median mining node, I don't see the median bw of a non-mining node being relevant in this reasoning.Sure, if you assume an average 500 bytes tx, a gigabit link (which is commonly found in professional settings) yields ~430 tx/s. We're nowhere near that. You can also turn it around and say that if you have a 1GB block size limit, you'll *need* a gigabit link to stand a chance as long as most miners are professionals.If I follow you and am not mistaken that means we can easily have ~200 tx/s with an epsilon marginal cost of inclusion. We're really nowhere near supporting the network on fees, and the next halving is approaching...In other words, with a 1gb block limit we can easily have the network grow x100 without even starting to support it with fees.I agree with this, both arguments are not mutually exclusive though. Let's put a bullet in the head of this argument once and for all.If people drive away, it frees up space in blocks, it's a self-correcting problem that nicely filters out people that thought they needed the Bitcoin-level bulletproof security level and finally realize they didn't. Umm... no.You confuse a syllogism and a basic linear function of the form f(x) = ax + bIn our case, f(x) is the profitability threshold and x is the marginal cost of inclusion of a transaction, a = 1 and b = 1.f(0) = 1, f(1) = 2, etc.I hope this makes it clearer for you. It sure is easy to argue against half a sentence, that's not really interesting for anyone but you though. We're headed to altcoin-ville here  I don't disagree with that, but it's pretty clear IBLT will remove a very big part of the incentive a node has to mine small blocks.Of course it wouldn't be 100%, but if the confidence heuristics you implicitly refer to, are pretty similar across nodes, I hardly see more than a few percent of the mempool set being dropped for "IBLT-safety" purposes, which doesn't fundamentally change the argument.And btw, your argumentation wrt pruning made sense. Nope. The lower the marginal cost of including a transaction in a block, the lower the minimum acceptable fee .If the marginal inclusion cost is zero, the minimum fee is one satoshi, if the marginal cost is one satoshi, then then the minimum fee is (wait for it...) two satoshi.How does this fundamentally change the reasoning? Well, any business that has sufficiently low costs to be able to turn this amount into a positive profit. 
Specifically?Sure, but we may never be aware of these reasons, we can only reason on the economic profitability of including, or not including a transaction, and as far as economics are concerned the reasoning holds. Do you agree with the argument that, with IBLT deployed, there is no rational reason for a miner to limit the size of blocks it is willing to mine ?(In other words, if blocks do not risk getting orphaned because of their big size, it is economically profitable for a miner to include all the transactions that bear a >0 fee, no matter how small the fee is). To be honest I'm not sure. There are a few things to keep in mind, for one we still have the block reward, so whatever experience we may or may not gain from observing an actual backlog may or may not apply to conditions where the block reward does not exist anymore.The fact that there is a backlog is meaningless if that backlog is made of changetips and other frivolous transactions that really don't require the level of security that native Bitcoin has to offer.You won't find a common denominator among technical people because this issue is hardly just a technical one. If your question is "do full blocks, and a transaction backlog increase the security of Bitcoin?" the answer is clearly yes, as this would induce bigger transaction fees, thereby inducing a bigger incentive for miners to secure the network. I see. There are critical security properties at stake here because playing with the block size is playing with core mining incentives.It has all sorts of perverse effects that miners do not have an incentive to make small blocks, which will be the case as soon as IBLT (Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables) are implemented.It used to be argued that miners would have an incentive to make small blocks because making large blocks that propagate slowly would be dangerous for them (they could lose it all in favor of smaller, faster propagating blocks). But with IBLT this incentive disappears.If this were to happen, miners would find themselves in a position where it would make economical sense to include whatever is thrown at them (because including a transaction would not increase their risk to end up with a big, orphaned block), and carries a non-zero fee, thereby making a very small private gain, but socializing the bulk of the cost, since everyone would have to process, and store (at least for a while), this transaction. Not quite sure I follow what you're saying.If what you're saying is that it makes no sense to propose solutions before actually witnessing a real problem, then I agree, if that's not what you're saying could you please clarify? There's so much wrong with Gavin's current proposal that I don't even know where to start.But yes, I'm not against a block size increase, if done properly, by competent people, when it becomes really valuable for Bitcoin to do so, and when the threats to decentralization are clearly mitigated by the hardware capacity at the time it is being discussed.I am not saying that the block size has to remain 1mb forever mind you, I'm saying that Gavin's approach and assumptions are completely braindamaged, and I'll do whatever it takes to kill it.There's really not much point in writing more if the guy isn't willing to discuss the basic assumptions he makes, and goals he targets and bases his constructions upon.He bases his whole reasoning on "every single transaction absolutely has to be in the blockchain no matter what it is about", no wonder the conclusions he reaches are pretty useless. That's because you don't pay enough attention. Sure, but that's irrelevant to the discussion at hand.That goes waaay further than changing a constant in the code. Don't get me wrong, if it didn't completely fuck up the incentives the max block size constraint would already be long gone, because it would be a no-brainer. The problem is that Bitcoin has a cost, and that people expect it to be paid forever by inflation, like it is today, except this doesn't work. Not sure that this would be of any use, it'd just incentivize miners to keep higher connectivity in order to bypass relaying nodes and receive transactions directly, not make smaller blocks. You're right on this one, shitty analogy. Lol, wtf is this brain damaged logic where "it's ok to deliberately make things weak and broken, because as soon as it becomes a problem, we can repair it" ? Lol no, he's referring to block version numbers. How can you even imagine such nonsense as "every block <1mb is invalid" ?What would that be? Obamacare? Yes, it is a terrible analogy.Then again, Bitcoin doesn't really suffer any analogies at all. The GSM network didn't need to "evolve" for iPhones to be able to function properly, in the very same way the core backbone that is Bitcoin doesn't need to be "fixed" with hardcoded exponential growth to allow innovation.You cannot be intellectually honest and claim that it is easier to revert to a previous version of something if you realize you fucked up than to fix problems when you actually have had an opportunity to actually witness and analyze them. Because it is my considered opinion that Bitcoin is perfect as it is and that it doesn't need to be "fixed" to provide tremendous value to humanity at large. Actually they do, because business class gets to hop off first. Said the guy crammed in an economy-class seat. Haha, seriously?Bitcointalk, inhabited by this very special brand of geniuses... C'est l'idée 
That would be a way to force the fork, under the assumption that the threats are empty. Well, if it could be attacked easily it wouldn't really be bitcoin anymore anyway  That is, if someone with commit access doesn't change the requirement to, say, 60%. Because good reasons and won't you think of the children. It does seem to bother you to share your position regarding the particular question at hand. Certainly not. And it'll be pretty obvious once you get around to answering this, you weaseled out of it one time, but the question isn't going anywhere and still stands. oO Sure. If that kind of business was easy and straigthforward, everyone would be doing it.The particular way in which we do it makes it so that each of our customers has an account directly with the financial partner, which makes cutting the tie on a whim much harder for the bank.It protects our customers a lot in the sense that the bank can't simply and suddenly freeze our funds on a BS pretext, they have to answer to each and every customer individually. As of today there are only two entities doing this properly, Paymium, and bitcoin.deJust putting a mirror in front of you. If that's not an enjoyable experience it's usually not the mirror that's to blame...You can't compare bitcoin to video games if you want to make any sort of sense.With your logic we end up with a new iOS every year, designed at pushing the hardware and getting us to buy a new iPhone...That's completely backwards, it just makes so much more sense to wait that the hardware actually is of handling it before doing a modification... Isn't this precisely what Gavin wants to do? By committing Bitcoin today, to what he thinks the capabilities of tomorrow's computers will be? Figured you'd weasel your way out of this one... Bingo.Anyway your intellectual dishonesty doesn't really matter, what matters is that everyone gets to see that you fail to answer this pretty simple question, and gets to make their mind up for themselves.Incidentally, this even seems pretty obvious to reddit too. To quote the top comment on this latests piece of yours: If you are arguing that everyone using the same tool for all means and purposes is a desirable goal, you should be prepared to explain why it is so desirable.I hope you won't find these words too frightening, which should leave you free to actually answer the question. Why would monoculture necessarily be a good thing ? That's kind of, you know, the point of a limit. You lack imagination, if the great firewall of China decides to block Facebook, poof, one billion less users. Overnight.That is, if it's not already blocking it, probably is, thinking about it...I argue that allowing the block size to grow is equivalent to making Bitcoin as vulnerable as Facebook currently is. In other words, centralized enough that it becomes vulnerable.See you added the 'trustless' bit later on. I happen to disagree.Anyway, it is my considered opinion that voting pools are pretty useless, because they constrain the OT servers in such a way that they have to be strictly iso-functional to all other OT servers participating in the same voting pools in order for the voting pools concept to work. Right. Doubtful Your reading and comprehension are accurate.Open Transactions is ready. Do your fucking homework before answering.Bitcoin isn't a assertocracy either.You will *get* used, as cumrags. Bitcoin is neither a democracy nor a stupidocracy, get over it. We'll park derps like you on dogecoin the same way one billion derps are herded towards Facebook every day.Kinda glad I'm not getting the same invitations as Gavin.You must be new here. This actually illustrates the point beautilfully, what would happen if, suddenly, one billion people couldn't use Facebook anymore?The idea that this would make the internet one fifth less useful is fucking ridiculous on its face.Absolutely not. That is only true for services that touch fiat.Have you had a look at OpenTransactions for example ? I never said "on an other chain". I said "off-chain".That's simply because that it is much more efficient. It really makes no sense to try to address all business needs with one single solution.Bitcoin is a very expensive technology, it's vastly counterproductive to try and insist that every customer gets addressed the same way.The question that comes more frequently is certainly not "will we be able to stay on-chain?", but it is "why do we have to wait 10 minutes to receive our money?".The true value that Bitcoin brings to the table is not "everyone gets to write into the holy ledger", it is instead "everyone gets to benefit from sane and non-inflationary financial instutions whose sanity and honesty are ensured by the holy blockchain".Do you genuinely think that the level of security provided by the blockchain is absolutely necessary for every single transaction? Do you honestly think everyone will be able to educate themselves enough to grasp how bitcoin actually works? and actually use it properly and securely?
If I really have to spell it out for you... I *own* Paymium. In other words : I am qualified to state what is strategic, and in the interest of startups of the space. You are not. Really? Since when is Bitcoin a democracy? yeah... who knows what goes through the head of altcoiners... Cool story, but it doesn't really solve anything. You obviously don't have the slightest clue about how bitcoin works. Reality shows us that a lot of miners will mine at a present loss and speculate on future value.We should not assume that miners are "nice", or "honest", it's a much safer bet to assume that they are greedy.If blocks are bigger he won't have a "choice", he'll *have* to create bigger blocks by including whatever comes his way that carries a fee.The miner won't be held back by block propagation time since it's to become O(1) with the introduction of IBLT.In other words, the marginal cost of including a transaction in a non-full block will be so low for the miner that includes it, that he will have no economic incentive to not include it.And by doing so he will push the storage cost to the network as a whole, it's a "privatized gain, socialized cost" situation if you will.By saying that, you make the implicit statement that someone, somewhere will be able to set a minimum fee, which is not the case, the whole isStandard() band aid is a joke in this regard.If people can send small transactions with tiny fees to miners, the miners will have an economic incentive to include them as long as the fee is > 0.The system doesn't need low value actors to increase its overall value, on the contrary, including those creates the risk that the system will crumble under its own weight.That is incorrect. The only choice miners get is "should I include this transaction in my block?".The answer is easy, it's a simple comparison of the marginal cost of inclusion versus the attached fee, and with IBLT the marginal cost of inclusion will not be constrained anymore by block size.In other words, miners will mine huge blocks at everyone's expense because they won't directly bear the actual cost of this inclusion.If you're able to describe an alternative where some system has all the advantages of bitcoin without none of its drawbacks, then very well, go ahead, I'm listening.This system will either be inferior, or suffer from the same issues.And if such a magical system actually exists, then very well, it deserves to win anyway.You confuse reality and speculation on one hand.Don't worry about reddit, they'll always have doge to throw at each other. Here you go : http://fr.anco.is/2015/gavineries/ So why do you have a 24h old account? It's actually pretty awesome and spot on.And what's that gonna be? dogecoin? Some other magical altcoin that somehow has all bitcoin's strong points but none of its weaknesses?Noobs are to do their homework, not address their betters without being talked to. It'll always be possible to build superior visas, and western unions on top of teleportable gold.As for the opposite... Which ones?Those your imaginary magic satoshi santa will bring for christmas? Bien au contraire mon ami :-) Yeah, low and arbitrarily chosen numbers never really were an issue for Bitcoin.And no, the block size isn't getting raised any time soon, and certainly not by Gavin. If you're poor you get to use verifiable paper gold, if you're able to pay the fee you can do whatever your heart desires with your gold.How cute. Sure, we're back at square one where this problem is entirely imaginary.There is a wide array of solutions at hand should commoners wish to transact in Bitcoin, side chains could be one, although I don't really buy it.I see Open Transactions variants as more promising as they can work with the infrastructure as it currently stands for example on one hand.On the other hand you can't compare bitcoin-enabled centralized services with their fiat counterpart, because with Bitcoin, their solvency can be trivially verified, and their prompt death made certain, should they misbehave.The true value proposition of Bitcoin isn't that everybody can send virtual gold dust around, it's that you can actually see your bank's gold stash behind bulletproof crypto-glass.The idea that there should be a one-size-fits-all for all problems, and all people doesn't have any value or merit. It's just some sort of religion. If you accept that not everything has to be trustless, then the 'problem' vanishes instantly. Yeah. Get used to it. In your logic you could download only what you're interested in. Not *all* chains.Which is actually better than having to download one massive bloatchain. Demand is irrelevant if it's not economically sensible to satisfy it.Nobody cares about demand for free lunch-money micro-transactions at the fucking brink's headquarters.
Maybe gtfo and go be off-topic somewhere else? "I'll assume, for the purpose of discussing X, that X is already granted".Seriously. What kind of braindamaged logic is this? Actually, that's something the one proposing to fork should answer. And yes, that's you.So far I'm really not convinced it is necessary. He seems to simply be asserting it without actually backing it in any way.If taken for granted it actually weakens the hardforkers' position. It's backwards in the sense that nodes sync in a trustless manner to gain knowledge of the tip, not the other way around.I wasn't following up on the pruning discussion. That's backwards. You can't arrive to meaningful conclusions if you base your reasoning on undemonstrated equalities.Yes, I was reasoning in the context of a "hey, i'm getting back online, what's the network been up to?" scenario. It becomes much easier to pretend some blocks don't exist to selected targets, and get them to accept selectively rewritten history for just long enough to rip them off. And we're back at this, ahem, "trusted" archive nodes business...So I get to waste bandwidth on every derp that figures keeping blocks around is unnecessary?And I'm supposed to keep doing that when blocks become increasingly large?Directly?Special, as in Ralph Wiggum special. That's very nice indeed, but I'd rather have the value of my stash rely on correctly aligned incentives than on the goodwill of a few hobbyist derps. It is a perfectly valid question, because why should one *not* prune? Altruism?Especially on a chain that adds 1 TB/year... Please answer this simple question: "how does one bootstrap a full node once everybody's pruning?". Please point me at one of these apps that currently serves a "critical function". What makes you think direct access to the blockchain is necessary to benefit from Bitcoin.What makes you think it wouldn't be good that payments occur instantly, and at massive scale through Bitcoin banks?Bitcoin banks that would have no regulatory barrier to entry, and would be fully auditable by anyone.Aren't solvency reports a much more important invention for the world at large than coffee-for-blowstamps iOS apps?And justusranvier, you don't seem to hang out in #opentransactions anymore, how come you're not even mentioning it as a perfectly valid growth avenue for "adoption" ? Sure, but please first demonstrate how there's currently not enough of it. As being a part of a sane market. So it's essentially making an altcoin.How does that substiate the claim that Bitcoin won't be able to support building on top of it? Be specific. If you claim that the current max tps rate is insufficient for X, you must at the very least provide an estimate for the tps required by X, and some relevant points about why X is important to Bitcoin, on one hand, and your reasoning behind the target tps rate for X.That would be the failure of your whole line of reasoning. The analogy does not hold. You're not proposing that we "replace" X by X'. Where X is worn off, and X' isn't.You're proposing instead that we should add a couple extra wheels to the car "because how is that car useful if it can't hold as much people as a bus does?".There is absolutely no substance to this claim. Yes. If that ever proves problematic that is.I have no problem with Bitcoin. Do you? Because there is currently no problem.
Well then I suggest advocating it when the time is right. With traincarswreck & LiteCoinGuy on ignore, it's much more readable.Yeah, and that's retarded. So? Everything on the same ledger? Herp. So basically, there's a current shortage of nodes. Which leads TBF to actually pay for people to run some.And at the same time considering making larger blocks? O look. The pruning bullshit.If everyones prunes the spent outputs, how does a full node synchronize from scratch?From 'trusted' archive nodes? Gimme a break. Not really in-depth. Not needed right now. While I'm not against - in principle - to the limit being bumped by sane people when, and if ever, *actually necessary*, I vigorously oppose Gavin's proposal of exponential block-size growth. It's either pure madness, or a straight attempt at sterilizing bitcoin by indirectly putting it into reach of governments through increased centralization. That's just because you don't recognize word salad when you see some. The same address, provided your transaction gets included by both chains.If not, one chain will think that the initial 10 btc never actually moved. Actually it will be trivial.Point a CPU miner or whatever at Eligius, receive a couple satoshis directly from a fresh coinbase as a reward, wait 120 confirmations.And here you go, you now have an output that's spendable strictly on one chain, and that you can use in any transaction to easily split an arbitrarily large amount of coins, which you can reuse to split more, and more, and more coins. Yup. Meaning their fungibility will be destroyed at the time of the fork.Which means in turn that there will be a market.And if there's a market, it's pretty obvious that one will be dumped and one will be hoarded, and that it'll seal the fate of one of the two diverging chains.In other words, it won't be a "vote", a "discussion", or a "negotiation", it'll pretty much be a rape. Part 2. Comments welcome. Are you referring to the magical multiplying fairy that also multiplies hardware and bandwith every year? Had I bought off GA, I'd consider a block size increase as one of the best ways to sterilize bitcoin. Sure, pulling numbers and guesstimates out of your ass, that's much easier. It's not a rule that's needed, like tvbcof said, a line needs to be drawn. Maybe you should err on the side of doing the actual fucking math instead.With 1mb blocks you can do roughly 7.76 tps when a transaction spends one output to two adresses: the payee, and the change address.That's stupid, because that's not what the guy was suggesting. His idea can be implemented in a single hard-fork implementing a *rule* not yet another hardcoded magic number. So much fucking word salad.... There is no "we", and you do not know. Ok lol.
Transaction fees. Duh. Lol no, fuck that, no appeal to authority will be tolerated as it is not a valid argument form.That's a very cool story, except I was talking about merged mining, not side-chains. Read what I write, you'll save us both time. "Roadstress says retarded shit, therefore Roadstress is an idiot".Sounds like a decent syllogism to me. I'm not interested in either of the "Satoshi willed it", and "but I want it sooooo bad" non-arguments.Please, explain to me how merged mining is insecure. Take your time.My argument is perfectly fine, and you actually add to it. For how could we come up with a sensible solution if we haven't actually experienced the issue? What makes you think that "original intent" has any semblance of relevance? What you think Satoshi "meant" is nowhere near as relevant as what Satoshi actually *did*.If you have a problem that resides entirely in your head, for which you apply arbitrary constraints to solutions that would otherwise be perfectly valid and practical, it is no wonder you're going to come up with "solutions" that sound like a load of garbage.There are two things, the Bitcoin "you want", and the Bitcoin that actually exists. And only one of them will eventually, and perhaps painfully, have to adapt to the other, my money's on reality.Since you seem keen on historical data I'll point out to you that none of the technically superior alt coins actually ever mattered, market-cap wise.OTOH if it's absurdly expensive to use, it'll very probably be absurdly valuable to own. Didn't he add one at some point?The one you want removed?Dumbass. If by this you meant that I dismissed your "point" as irrelevant, then yes.Appeal to a long-gone authority does not constitute "a point".Look how suddenly one quote becomes, drumroll:Look, you seem to misunderstand the nature of this conversation. We are not "in an argument" in order to "find a solution" to some mutually-understood "problem". We are instead in this situation where I'm simply stating that there is currently no "problem" to "solve".Thank you for making that point for me. When we indeed find ourselves in the presence of a slow starting car, do we really want to have to look, embarrassed, at this fifth wheel, that sounded like a really good idea at the time? No, when have this issue, we pop open the fucking hood, and have a look at what's *actually* wrong. No. I'm stating, plainly and simply, that nobody gives the slightest fuck about what Satoshi is assumed to have meant.If he really feels strongly about this he knows how to use GPG and let us know.In other words, you have a brain, use it. You loved daddy very much, we all did, but now he's gone, and like all daddies, he wasn't always right about everything all the time.Here you have it.Hah. I kinda like this one, imma use it to refer to Bitcoin from now on. So you somehow suspected that Bitcoin is about money? Good job einstein."Why are you against adding a fifth wheel to your car?".Because my car moves perfectly fine with four wheels. Yes. Precisely this. And you forgot that the 'specific profile' has to be maintained at all times to prevent exclusion.Being in college debt doesn't really count towards a proper education.Not doing your fucking homework when ordered so does however score you a few points on the retarded piece of shit scale. You have some homework to do. This particular fork advocating eternal blockchain growth and never-full blocks should indeed be seen as an attack. Check my registration date. Well, apparently so are you. Just don't create more problems. That's exactly what imaginary worlds are, only ideas."Let's increase the size of blocks now and create problems, for which we may or may not find a solution, later. But that's ok, later is not now, right?" Well, you're kinda reading bitcointalk, which is trolls and derpage all the way down, so... A what? Absolutely none. "Making a different Bitcoin that can do X, Y and Z" is in essence making an altcoin.
Do you have any idea how much time is required to bootstrap a full node?Also nobody gives the slightest fuck about lighthouse. Bitcoin is the fucking service. You seem to be living in a parallel universe where your statements become true just because you state them. Was he arguing? What about "you don't get to opine" ? An opinion can't be considered as a valid argument when it comes to changing a quite sensitive protocol, can it?Except it's not just about "giving the network more capabilities".Referring to satoshi's supposed authority by the means of your personal interpretation is no argument.  Lolk, go away. Who wants to change Bitcoin again? That's not really how a sane brain works.Or maybe we agree with neither the premise, nor that the conclusion even logically follows. Try it. Stop breathing. Are you dead? Facts can not, by definition, reside in the future. Cool story, why does the decision have to be made now though?Because it'll be harder to achieve consensus later? That would simply mean the fork wasn't really needed in the first place.If the fork is actually necessary in the future it should follow that at that point consensus will be easier to achieve? Where? Be specific. Well, it's either this, or 'intellectually challenged'. I find flying to be neither easy nor boring  Your lack of google-fu is disturbing.Or else what? You're going to hold your breath until I do?Now instead of running around in circles and 'wanting' stuff, I suggest you work on this brain of yours, go for a little read, have a poke at OpenTransactions and its voting pools for example. You might even learn a thing or two along the way. Yes, at the very least for now.It should be seen as an advantage that the solutions built on top of this would end up being actually much more consumer-friendly than insisting on everyone using the blockchain directly. Bitcoin's potential to disrupt financial institutions lies in its ability to actually push the bankrupt ones into bankruptcy, and allow actual transparency. Not in letting Joe and Jane play the banker. It's kinda weird hearing people speak about the space scarcity in blocks as a 'limitation'.The same way 21m had been presented as one since "not everyone will ever be able to have one full coin".Direct access to the blockchain for everyone is not necessary for bitcoin to achieve disruption. Cute.According to this braindamaged logic Airbus shouldn't be able to sell its A380s, they're 400mn a pop after all.Haha, sure, let's change the fucking curve while we're at it.It's a no-brainer in the sense that only someone without a brain would opine. This argumentation hardly holds.I can put as much hashpower on top of my transaction as I see fit, I just need to wait for the appropriate number of confirmations.If my transaction is worth 1mn, the block reward is 40k, I just need to wait for 50 confirmations to put 2mn worth of fees on top of it, this is hardly rocket science...You guarantee... What exactly?But I mean if you're happy with Fedwire, what exactly is it you're doing here?
What is this "full capacity" magic number?Are you saying that because I'm a meanie I don't want to share that Bitcoin goodness, that would be available to everyone to transact with, if only we increased the block size?Do you genuinely think that I was somehow smart enough to go all-in on Bitcoin in 2010, and yet, too dumb to not keep my interests aligned with those of Bitcoin as a whole?Not really, the thing that you fail to see, is that when deciding to include a transaction or not in a block, the miner is already working on a block.He doesn't compute the gain from including the transaction by comparing its fees with the average cost of a transaction in that block, but with the marginal cost of including that particular one. Let that sink in for a minute.That's not very clear... And I don't think it has that much to do with the discussion at hand anyway.Betamax and VHS... If you're a customer, ask about it in a support request, if you don't like the answer, make the free market work.Decentralization is a good thing, and like all good things it has a price tag, whether you come to terms with it or not is entirely up to you.And no, I'm not going to give 'insight' on the imaginary issues that reside in your head.Didn't I mention "its shortcomings", like in the very text you quoted?Aren't you the one that wants to avoid discussion by putting words in my mouth? Using SWIFT, gold coins, or special drawing right to transfer 5 bucks isn't very smart.But if you really insist on it for some ideological reason, it'll be 10 bucks thank you very much.So you're saying that there could be an alt that would allow you to benefit from the same advantages of Bitcoin, but none of its shortcomings. Please tell me how that magical alt coin might work.20 times epsilon is still not much bigger than epsilon, especially if you need to pay for 20 times the bandwidth and hard drive space.If the blocks never fill up there can not be a sane transaction fee market supporting an abundant hashing power.Nobody is expecting instant gratification, and certainly not those that are against some random change that supposedly will bring moar adopshun, more moons, more prices.I care about decentralization and security. Not about your inability to demand a proof of reserves. There was no soft-fork for the 250kB default block-size limit.Currently the fees are very, very, very far from being anywhere near of an amount sufficient to secure the network.We're all having a free lunch right now, due to coins still being minted, but if that was to stop tomorrow, the network would be in an extremely shitty state.What's the problem with paying 10 bucks instead of 10 cents to securely transfer a million dollars? You seriously fail to see the massive trade-off? We're back at square one. Bitcoin is fine. Sure. Remind everyone of the current average block size.Do you remember the CoinValidation derps?Long story short: random nobodies don't pay for their starbucks using SWIFT, so what?Bitcoin is the backbone, not reddit's pocket change. I'm not going to buy an extra hard-drive every year to store changetips.And no, consumer hard-drive space isn't "growing exponentially", consumer hard-drive space is going towards SSDs.I'm happy with Bitcoin as it is. And if something is hard to change that usually means the change is not justified.If changing is really necessary for miners, don't worry, you'll hear about it. No. One simple way to state that one should not fix what is not broken.Sure, with a bit of imagination any derp can come up with a ton of imaginary issues that require immediate attention. Don't fix what isn't broken. Have a read. You must be new around here.You're referring to the "oops! we accidentally hard-forked bitcoin", back in march 2013? Bitcoin is a tool about creating decentralized consensus. Not give voting rights to random derps.That's pretty cute actually. No. Has it occurred to you that usually, the majority of the people doesn't get a say about the elite? By very fucking definition? So shut the fuck up.Thank you very much :-) Is Bitcoin currently broken? Nope. By this logic we don't fix what isn't broken. You seem to only have been given a meta-brain.Circular logic is circular. Evidence of what exactly? The fees today hardly equal a tiny fraction of the block reward, yet you're advocating increasing available space?Since it's obviously costlier to mine a bigger block, in lots of ways, the expected profit can only be lower if the revenue is the same, and hence the chain is *less* secure.Ask anyone with a bit of money in the bank, that's fucking cheap to teleport gold. It's not an assumption, it's the result of thinking and reasoning.Also if you think bitcoin needs to be modified you're the one that has to construct a valid point.That's because most clients force it on them.Lol no, compare the tx fees to the current block rewards.T'is in the blockchain baby.Because people aren't even paying 4 cents today.
That's what I'm arguing.More centralization, non-full blocks and therefore less fees, therefore less incentive to mine, therefore less secure network.See above.And with how things are today?This man gets it. Let's break it down.My pleasure. You took the time to read, I'll take the time to answer.The main point is, as you've probably noticed, that blocks have to be full.That's simply because if a resource isn't scarce you cannot have a market for it, pretty much for the exact same reason that you couldn't have a lemonade stand next to a lemonade river.That's cool but that's not happening, Bitcoin is extremely inefficient for this.Trying to create some universal one-size-fits-all solution for vastly different things is exactly how you end up with bloated shit nobody wants to use.Sure XML can do more than JSON. Yet guess what...The market has no way to force a price on me since the blocks aren't full.You have to get used to it, eventually the transactions will cost money. Money that comes out of your pocket.Right now the "free" transaction I'm making is pretty much subsidized by current and future miners, as they're bearing its verification and storage costs.It's not a "premise" it is a fact. Look at the numbers, look at the block reward/fees ratio for current blocks.At some point, if Bitcoin is to remain secure, fees *have* to take over, and right now the hard data shows that fees are ridiculously low.Where and when is it said that Bitcoin's purpose is to *only* use Bitcoin?It is said nowhere, because that is stupid.If you need to screw a screw and hammer a nail, you get a screwdriver and a hammer. You don't try to design, for some misplaced ideological reasons, a shitty tool that's a screwdriver on one end and a hammer on the other, for a hammer and a screwdriver both need a firm grip on their handle.You're more than welcome to make Bitcoin more convenient by building on top of it.However, if you really must insist that the core protocol be hard-forked you're in for a lot of pain.I'm not getting on-chain changetip forced on me. No. fucking. way. Who's going to be able to run a full node once we have to store every redditard's fraction of cent bouncing around? And you say you're against centralization? Srsly.For some odd reason I'm unable to picture some hypothetic economic actor that somehow has enough property to want it protected in the holy blockchain but too poor or not smart enough to realize that "If you won't pay for nice things you can't have nice things because there can't be nice things."No man, use whatever floats your boat!There's also no code protectionism, I'm not extremely attached to the code that's been shat by the kowr devz, that gave us the infamously unexpected march 2013 hardfork and the no less lulzy "pls to not update openssl because reasons".I have no problem with some people not being able to afford Bitcoin.For the data regarding fees being the key to security, and their current relative absence see my previous replies.I don't make that assumption. Sure Bitcoin competes with other payment means, so what?If people want to pay for their starbucks they'll pick the correct tool for the job and will probably end up not using Bitcoin for that particular purpose.Gold isn't less valuable because you can't use it at McDonalds, no?You misunderstand what he's saying, not that he's right anyway.We were given teleportable gold that also happens to be invisible for fuck's sake, that has incredible value in itself, it's neither necessary, nor - for all the reasons exposed - desirable, that it also doubles as a pay-your-parking-ticket-on-the-blockchain dumbed-down version. Be my guest, yo. This. A thousand times. No. This isn't very clear so I won't comment.Wrt to luke-jr's attack it wasn't this. He simply had the difficulty shoot up, and then left, leaving the altcoin issuing one block every X days, rendering it pretty much unusable. You are correct, it's not implemented and full blocks are required to trustlessly verify txes.However, what I'm talking about is simply postponing the upload of the txes for the blocks you mine.If you're a miner and can't find a way to connect the inputs of a new tx you're receiving, you just ask around for the merle branch you're interested in, or postpone inclusion of that particular transaction. And when the previous transaction comes around, you can include it.Miners will have an incentive to push such a behavior, because it'll allow them to include more fee-paying transactions, reddit would also push it because it'd allow them to keep tipping each other bitcents onchain for a satoshi per transaction. He put the limit in the source code. It's up to you to find a quote of him suggesting it'd have to be removed. Hah. You're right. Totally not.With a 51% attack you can at most make half the blocks empty, not "exclude anyone's toes from mined blocks".What he did was perform a 10000% attack, had the difficulty adjust, and then left. What that does, and why that's hardly possible with Bitcoin is left as an exercise for the reader.You send the headers first, and the actual contents of the block later. No, that's possible. It's just incredibly harder to pull-off. Double-spends would become a concern before this gets anywhere near serious.Ever heard of "headers first" ?Fine with me. It's actually the other way around. It's going to be dogecoinesque all over again, weeee!1Maybe bitcointalk will finally be able to get Gavin his own bobsleigh team! Hrm? Elaborate a bit on the practicalities of your cheap attack where one "must only make the reward higher" will you?Luke-jr raped some altcoin once, that's a super cool story but that doesn't really relate to Bitcoin in any way other than being some lame anecdotal evidence for your nebulous argument. It's the margin that tends to zero, not the reward.Your attack is self-correcting, manage to make the global hashrate drop, everyone's rig is suddenly more valuable. PoW is economically broken because the margins tend towards zero? Seriously? There are actually two distinct constructs at play here, they are not equivalent. Consider:Me.You. Whether you like the truth or not doesn't it make any less true.Still not an argument. Try harder, if you can. There are no barriers to create an offchain transaction clearing service.That's an ad-hominem, not an argument. Try harder. Thing is, there's no problem to fix.It is the redditards that will have to fix their expectation of being able to transact their fraction-of-a-penny spamtips on the blockchain for fractions-of-fractions-of-a-penny.Offchain are good enough for them.Except the burden of making a convincing argument doesn't lie with those who are perfectly happy with Bitcoin as it is.That's dumb, for there can hardly be any viable rent situation without serious barriers, of which the regulatory ones are the most obvious ones.
Say it: "i'm a socialist". That'll make everything clearer.Sure, a lot of derps of your kind have forked bitcoin to various irrelevant altcoins.Exactly what gavin intends to do.of redditards. so what?they're as irrelevant as dogecoin when it comes to Bitcoin. Imaginary BTC isn't fungible with the real thing.No it really doesn't, it just says there's a market, a set of variables and that the former will bitchslap the latter into place.That remains to be demonstrated. How does your failure to see me imply my absence? No.k. Yup, that's how Jeremias Kangas does business, guess he can go fuck himself.I don't think he'll ever recoup his investment though since this domain isn't used anymore.Sometimes I have patience for derps, sometimes not. Les teubé qu'on se récolte... Sans déconner. Non, c'est basé sur blowfish Super. Normalement c'est la que tu t'arrêtes de parler.Bienvenue au club, t'es juste un peu à la bourre  Moi je me contente de leur faire les gros yeux, en général c'est plié en cinq minutes. Pourquoi ? Je pense que le temps de faire ça comme tu le décris sera sensiblement identique au temps que le script prend à tourner.Ben une URL qui passe sur du HTTPS c'est pas moins sécurisé qu'un cookie de session.Le site disait aussi clairement que ce n'était pas une solution faite pour stocker des grosses quantités, mais vraiment d'un truc destiné à découvrir et à l'argent de poche. Augmente le "sleep" Tu n'as aucun moyen que je connaisse qui permette d'avoir un historique de TX pour une adresse arbitraire via bitcoind, d'ou blockchain Oui, le mec était un débile notoire.La réponse que je lui ai faite quand il a commencé à vraiment me les briser : http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ep5yo/how_i_shut_down_instawallet/ca2fhyrTu crois que je l'ai pas déjà fait ca ? J'ai pris l'adresse de cold-storage d'instawallet, je suis parti de la pour récursivement trouver toutes les adresses liées (donc en prenant en compte toutes celles qui étaient apparues dans les inputs d'une même transaction), ensuite j'ai regardé les transactions entrantes sur ces adresses.Le résultat étant qu'aucune de ces adresses n'a de total de dépôts correspondant à ce qu'il avance.(le script à pris plusieurs jours à s'exécuter :-) ) C'est quoi exactement la question?En gros une URL de wallet contenait une partie variable qui était en correspondance avec un wallet dans notre DB.Pour un wallet, il y avait une adresse de dépôt, les fonds reçus sur une adresse de dépôt étaient crédités sur le wallet correspondant.Par contre les retraits se faisaient depuis le pool, comme n'importe quel shared wallet en fait.On avait aussi un cold-storage. Ouais, pour passer pour un con dans celui la il faut vraiment y aller.Sinon juste un autre truc :c'est factuellement incorrect. Ben qu'est-ce que tu veux que je lui dise que je ne lui aie pas déjà dit?C'est un truc dans ce genre la que tu veux faire?http://log.bitcoin-assets.com/?date=12-06-2014#714645Parce que je l'ai déjà fait.Pour ce qui est de la diffamation... Bwhahahahahah, priceless. Non, ça c'est pas un NDA, c'est une clause d'un accord amiable.Un NDA est utilisé dans d'autres situations, habituellement dans des phases de négociation. C'est cette partie la qu'il manque.Par définition si quelque chose est déjà public faire un NDA n'a pas de sens.
Quand je dis vendu, ça veut dire que je suis simplement d'accord pour échanger $50k contre 300 BTC, rien de plus.Ton message laisse entendre que ça constitue un settlement avec PG, ce qui n'est pas le cas.Je t'invite à clarifier sur l'autre thread :-) Vendu! Bon les loulous, c'est quoi les *faits* ici ?Allez-y, j'ai tout mon temps. La pub, les gogos qui paient pour les services d'anonymisation etc. Le truc qu'il manque à ton analyse c'est qu'utiliser le noeud de quelqu'un d'autre ça ne restera pas gratuit éternellement.Problème résolu. pour recevoir des bitcoins il te faut un nodeNon mais sérieusement, quand on sait pas, le mieux c'est de s'abstenir. Lurke encore. Ca faisait longtemps en effet!Welcome back! Je vais regarder.Y a un peu de concret ou c'est encore au stade projet ?(oui oui je sais, la réponse est probablement dans la vidéo). Un projet sérieux dont personne n'a entendu parler, je demande à voir.Les produits dérivés c'est un domaine intéressant. Ah oui, donc en gros ma seed ne fonctionnerait pas? J'ai droit à une neuve offerte pour récupérer mes Bitcoins coincés sur l'ancienne  ? Avec plaisir :-)Si t'es dispo cet après-midi j'en profiterai pour marcher un peu pendant ma pause clope @EricKennedy : Tu peux préciser ce que l'ACP a dit? Est-ce qu'ils le font rentrer dans le cadre du change manuel? Du coup j'imagine que vous avez fait une déclaration? Ce serait intéressant étant donné qu'en l'état actuel de la législation, le scope du change manuel ce sont les devises ayant cours légal dans un état reconnu par la France ainsi que les travelers cheque et autres instruments de paiement libellés dans une de ces monnaies. J'ai passé plein de temps, avec plein d'avocats, et je vous redis qu'un ATM n'entre pas dans le champ de compétences de l'ACPR, et que donc, par conséquent, aucune licence particulière n'est nécessaire.En revanche, les implications en termes de TVA sont loin d'être évidentes. Non, opérer un ATM n'entre pas dans le cadre de la prise de position de l'ACPR. J'ai pas vu de résumé particulier.Je retente.

HALP amen Mais donc tu n'as pas porté toute la partie tests ? +1 Pari placé Voila, il n'y a simplement pas de notion "d'enjeu" dans Bitcoin.Je crois que c'est ça qui gênait notre ami hologram.Les pauvres auront du low-cost : des transactions off-chain. L'argument ne tient pas, les variations vont en général dans les deux sens. Non, ça contrevient simplement aux principes du socialisme.C'est différent dans la mesure ou c'est un système qui est juste, c'est un système ouvert à ceux qui y apportent des ressources, sans distinction de race ou de nationalité.C'est différent dans la mesure ou c'est un système ou tu es responsable et qui ne laisse personne décider à ta place. Si tu es riche ton argent est ton argent, si tu es pauvre, charge à toi de devenir riche.De la même manière qu'un cordonnier ne chausse pas les culs-de-jatte, une monnaie n'a pas vocation à être égalitaire et à rendre les pauvres moins pauvres.Bitcoin a simplement vocation à rendre le système plus efficace d'un point de vue économique. Bitcoin n'est pas une démocratie, et c'est très bien comme ça.Que les pauvres en soient exclus n'a rien de choquant. Il me semble que la limite hard du protocole a toujours été de 1 Mo, ce qui a simplement changé c'est le setting par défaut de taille max pour les mineurs.En d'autres termes les mineurs respectent leur propre valeur en créant leur block mais considèrent valides tous les blocks qui leur sont présentés avec une taille <= 1 Mo.Des plus petits blocks forcent des commissions sur transactions plus élevées d'une part.D'autre part avec des gros blocks, le temps de propagation devient plus important et désavantage les mineurs qui ont des connexions moins performantes.Oui, c'est eux qui décident en fait, les devs peuvent faire ce qu'ils veulent, si les mineurs ne suivent pas alors ca ne marche pas.Oui, ce serait un altcoin.N'importe quoi.(et faut apprendre à compter aussi, 100 confirmations se font en moyenne en 16 heures et 40 minutes, pas deux jours) C'est pas une question de savoir si les développeurs travaillent sur le problème, c'est une question de savoir si les mineurs accepteraient de monter la taille max des blocks, et pour l'instant c'est pas vraiment le cas. Si tu prends en compte : - Le temps moyen entre deux blocks - La taille maximum d'un block - La taille moyenne d'une transactionet que tu mélanges le tout, tu arrives au fait que Bitcoin ne peut, à l'heure actuelle, que traiter en moyennes 7 tx/s.En clair c'est très loin d'être énorme, et dès qu'on plafonnera ça commencera à se bastonner pour une place dans un block, à coups de tx fees. Sure, you can use 16hgikkYjrYh5o63B5ZsCtCisu49mrXBM1 as a deposit system.You deposit Bitcoins, they show up in my balance.You're welcome. Un peu de code pourra peut-être t'éclairer.https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-pool/blob/master/lib/bitcoin/block_header.rb derp Watching. Dommage, les mots sont le meilleur, sinon le seul, véhicule de la pensée.Note que ceux qui savent jouer avec les mots, et les utiliser qui récoltent les gonzesses et le pognon, pas les journalistes de l'huma.Ca marche déjà comme ca Je vais m'armer d'encore un peu de patience alors  Rien qu'en disant ca tu crée déjà deux cases, ceux qui sont d'accord, et ceux qui ne le sont pas.Ca te permet par la suite de te ranger dans une des deux, c'est un processus cognitif plutôt normal.Le simple fait de nommer une chose la met déjà dans une case. La case c'est la division, c'est comme ça que fonctionne notre mental, on n'y peut rien.Par contre, l'esprit n'est pas *que* le mental. +1Il faut "toujours vouloir mettre dans une case", autrement dit, il faut chercher à nommer les choses.Il faut simplement être capable d'inventer une nouvelle case quand c'est nécessaire.
Nice, that's the blog where there are like 10 articles, 9 about bitcoin-central being this and that, and like 2 comments.For everyone's amusement, yesterday's IRC conversation with the bitcoinbourse guy (dotcoin): http://log.bitcoin-assets.com/?date=10-05-2014#669983 lol Si t'avais été la fin 2010 t'aurais aussi entendu : "Mais euh, les GPU c'est pas juste!"Satoshi disait pas mal de conneries.La preuve, arms race ou pas, les paquets de nouveaux sont arrivés. Je re-pose la question.Il me semble avoir lu ça dans un de vos posts, j'ai peut-être rêvé, si c'est le cas dites-le moi. Yo, srs bzns."Don't want to get scammed for 1 BTC, get scammed for 0.25 BTC instead!" So... Why do you need capital for ?Pay for advertising ?And if so, how will you do it without touching fiat ? +1.Bitcoin c'est la mort du socialisme. I guess not missing his mouth with his fork will already count as an acomplishment  Such wow Moui, sous la protection de Kim Jong Il aussi.Peut mieux faire. Non, le Bitcoin est une hashocratie. Bitcoin n'est pas "démocratique". You had me at : Vu ce que vaut la fonction publique... Yeah, you're right, completely forgot about this. It can totally be gamed, just sell your coins in small chunks to avoid the fee altogether, guess we're back at "the correct answer is to count properly with higher precision"Theoretically, even counting at an arbitrarily large, but finite, precision can be gamed this way. Even with 8 digits of precision, buying satoshis one by one at a 100 Currency/BTC spot and a .5% commission rate would lead to 5E-11 BTC fees being rounded to 0 (given a 1E-8 precision).Even with a minimum trade amount you'd have some small rounding artefacts on fees due to small partially filled order remainders being executed against, so you have to take an extra step.So, to summarize, the most correct course of action is to  - Count with an arbitrary precision, preferably very small, - Impose a minimum order size that is a very large multiple of the precision - Remove bids from the book when their remaining volume is smaller than (precision /(2*fee)) - Remove asks from the book when their remaining volume is smaller than (execution_price * precision / (2 * fee))Numerical example for the bid side - Spot is 500 USD/BTC - Precision is 10^-8 - Fee : .5% (0.005)(The reasoning is similar for asks but I can't be fucked right now)Who knew so much fun could come from working with finite-precision numbers  The rationale is that they don't want to bother with small timers.Pretty much the same on the NYSE, seats are fucking expensive.Your conclusion does not really follow logically from your premise.Satoshidice got listed there, made me money :-) Lol, après "une question vague, la réponse est attendue en trois parties structurées", "courage, notre sondage est stupide mais on sait que vous allez y répondre".Haha, désolé mais j'ai pas pu m'empêcher XD Je ne dis pas que les questions sont basiques, je dis qu'elles n'ont pas la moindre pertinence, et que par conséquent il serait difficile d'en tirer des informations de valeur. Après c'est votre sondage, pas le mien. Je veux pas être méchant mais les questions sont un peu nazes. Tu es plus expérimenté que je ne pensais 
Personnally I like eating shit, it just tastes a little bit like feces but with a pinch of salt it's just fine. À quel sujet ?Pour ce qui est de conserver des fonds de tiers il y a la directive européenne sur les service de paiements (il y a toutes le références postées plus haut, il suffit de lire). Vos arguments sont invalides, quand je dis richesse je ne pense pas nécessairement à l'argent :pSi tu es intelligent et que tu veux de l'argent, tu en auras, si t'es con et que tu veux du fric, alors garde la pêche. J'étais même pas au courant qu'il y avait une différence, on en apprend tous les jours. OTOH it's reassuring to deal with an exchange that's obviously picky about the things it lists Either this, or round fairly, because on average it would even out.+1, it's not like it wasn't clearly laid out. Qu'est-ce qui vous fait penser que les gens expérimentés ont le désir de vous tenir la main?C'est à vous de vous adapter, certainement pas l'inverse. Des noms ?S'ils avaient des soucis financiers importants c'est peut-être qu'ils n'étaient pas si malins que ça...Par ailleurs, même en ayant des soucis financiers, une personne intelligente n'en aurait vendu qu'une partie.En d'autres termes, une personne intelligente aura évalué correctement les opportunités économiques qui s'offraient à elle en prenant par exemple un crédit, plutôt qu'en se débarrassant d'un actif très sous-évalué.Je ne m'embarrasse habituellement pas trop du politiquement correct, je ne fais pas de politique Par ailleurs, il est important de noter que ce n'est pas parce qu'une idée est "modérée" qu'elle est plus proche de la réalité... +1. Faites leur suivre une formation de vente/commerce. Avec validation des acquis de l'expérience si pertinent. Quand j'ai mis 2k dans un machine dédiée au minage en 2010, plein de gens m'ont dit que j'étais en plein délire.Quand je dis aujourd'hui que le système financier tel qu'on le connait est déjà mort, plein de gens me trouvent un peu extrême.Tant pis pour eux, c'est moi qui continuerai d'être riche  That's actually a sane attitude, don't touch something you don't understand, work towards better understanding and decide when you understand enough to do so on logical grounds.The insane attitude is deciding by following the herd of derps.mikemikemike it's very dangerous to fake volume or to inflate prices, you run the risk of being beaten to a pulp by the market.If you decide to inflate the price of your stock and I own some what is to prevent me to sell it to you while you inflate?In other words, it doesn't make economical sense to fuck with the market if you're here to stay. Tu sembles oublier que la possession de BTC sera corrélée avec l'intelligence.En d'autres termes, les gens qui sont riches ne le sont pas par hasard.Donc considérer que les gens riches, ceux qui pourraient avoir un impact significatif, sont stupides, est déjà en soi une erreur de raisonnement.Non, la circulation de BTC dette sera illimitée, la circulation de BTC restera limitée.Les gens intelligents, les riches qui comptent, sauront très bien faire la différence.Le manque d'intelligence étant fortement corrélé à la pauvreté le problème se règlera de toute façon tout seul.J'ai un peu l'impression de me répéter des fois :-) If it was actually explained like you were five years old it might already get too technical for you.See, the prerequisite to explaining stuff in such a way, is that the person you explain stuff to is assumed to have mental capabilities that are equal, or exceed, those of an actual five years old.Start with additions, when you're confident about them, move on to multiplications, you'll see, it's easy, a multiplication is just a repeated addition after all. I have no stake in this, but I happen to have interacted with Markus Weiler a couple of times already, my opinion on him is : "the guy does not even have the intellectual ability to be a scammer". No, you get to keep your bitcents there. Your dysfunctional brain would be much better served by a dysfunctional engine, neither of them displays the simple ability to add and multiply numbers correctly. Yes, donc on est d'accord, pas d'exemption de TVA, simplement des modalités particulières pour sa collecte  Il me semble que dans certains cas la TVA est due par l'acheteur, mais qu'il n'y a pas d'exonération stricto-sensu. FTFY Their base fee is .5%.If you place a $5 order you should be charged $0.025, but instead you will be charged $0.03.In other words, even with their "fix", you'd get charged 20% more than advertised.I see folks cheering because their answer to the situation was fast...It's as if the people here would be happy to be served a plate of steaming shit in a restaurant, instead of actual food, as long as the waiter's fast. Ben si tu veux des arguments tu viens discuter la ou je te l'ai indiqué.Je peux pas refaire l'explication à chaque fois qu'un type s'inscrit sur le forum, s'il montre un peu d'intelligence, d'intérêt et qu'il sait se sortir les doigts alors pourquoi pas :-)Non, la il faut juste apprendre à lire, j'ai jamais dit une chose pareille.Ben illustre ton propos avec open transactions et je te répondrai avec OT... L'idée est valable pour toutes les techniques qui ont vocation à transmettre des claims sur d'autres actifs, en clair, des IOU, que ce soit Ripple, OT, Ethereum, CC etc. ne change absolument rien sur le fond.
Yes, mais par des textes de loi bien précis, ils sont assujettis à d'autres taxes qui leur sont propres.Certainement pas. On aura l'occasion d'en reparler, ce n'est vraiment pas quelque chose qui va de soi de s'affranchir de l'assiette normale de la TVA. Quid de la TVA ? Mauvaise idée. Tout comme l'or, et contrairement à de la nourriture, le Bitcoin n'a aucune valeur intrinsèque.Ce n'est pas pour cela que son prix de marché ne peut pas se stabiliser. I'm slightly amused by the implication that the fact I operate another exchange somehow makes the hard figures, and the shittyness of the workaround any different  La raison pour laquelle c'est le professeur qui évalue l'élève et non l'inverse, c'est en général que le professeur sait ce que l'élève ne sait pas. Ce dernier ne peut pas, par définition, savoir ce qu'il ne sait pas. C'est pour ça qu'on ne lui demande que rarement de s'auto-évaluer.Tu as des choses à apprendre, et visiblement encore un petit paquet.Quand tu auras un peu avancé dans ta réflexion tu te rendras compte qu'au fond du fond, les CC sont, certes, une jolie invention technologique, mais qu'au fond ils n'apporteront pas grand chose de fondamental ni dans le domaine de la finance en général, ni dans celui de la finance participative en particulier. Je pense qu'on aura l'occasion d'en rediscuter, et je t'invite par ailleurs à venir faire un tour sur #bitcoin-assets si le sujet t'intéresse.Mon ami Nicolas Dorier part d'encore trop loin pour avoir une discussion constructive, je le laisse réfléchir sur sa réaction face à un supermarché qui ne proposerait, en lieu et place des oeufs, des titres sur des oeufs. Accepterait-il d'en acheter la bas ? Non, et pourtant c'est en essence ce qu'il suggère en disant que les BTC cash et dette sont "dépensables" de manière similaire. En paiement j'accepte le BTC, pas une promesse de BTC. Non, et pour la dernière fois, ils ne sont absolument pas fongibles. Déjà aujourd'hui on voit plein d'échoppes qui n'acceptent pas les chèques, cela veut dire que la promesse de monnaie bancaire n'est, pour certains, pas fongible avec la monnaie bancaire elle-même.Bref, j'arrête de perdre mon temps ici. A+  Peut-être vaudrait-il mieux dans ce cas privilégier le fait de lire et de vous éduquer, plutôt que de commenter ... Ben, rien de particulier, pourquoi ? Charge à toi de penser plus fort.Par exemple, tu imagines que les BTC dette seront à terme fongibles avec les BTC cash ce qui est tout simplement une aberration.Ca voudrait dire que tout le monde accepte de se faire payer avec du papier plutôt qu'avec du cash, c'est plus que douteux.Tu imagines qu'il suffit de changer un ratio de réserve pour gonfler la quantité de monnaie d'un système, faisons simple, partons du principe que le ratio de réserve n'existe pas, et que la banque puisse émettre autant qu'elle veut, plus elle émettra, plus elle sera vulnérable au bank run. Ton raisonnement fonctionnerait s'il existait un prêteur de dernier recours comme aujourd'hui, ce qui n'est pas le cas.Une autre confusion est la différence entre une créance et une dette. Non un BTC cash n'est pas une "créance", c'est simplement une ressource, le BTC papier est bien une dette par contre.Un oeuf est une ressource, une reconnaissance de dette pour un oeuf est un titre, qui est une créance dans les mains du créancier et une reconnaissance de dette quand elle est présentée au fermier.L'oeuf et son titre de propriété ne sont ni équivalents, ni fongibles, si j'ai faim je refuserai le titre de la part du fermier et je lui demanderai un vrai oeuf.Bref, tout ça pour dire qu'il y a trop d'hypothèses de base complètements foireuses pour construire un raisonnement qui tienne un tant soit peu la route.Une saine lecture qui peut t'aider à remettre certains concepts de base à leur place "La théorie de la monnaie et du crédit" par Mises : https://mises.org/books/tmc.pdfPour notre ami ejp : btcjam est une arnaque monumentale. Ben oui, mais après il faut les distribuer aux votants, et du coup celui qui les distribue peut savoir qui a voté pour qui. Ok, on a donc vu que la dette et le cash n'étaient pas mutuellement fongibles.Avec une monnaie en existant quantité finie, le taux d'intérêt moyen est mécaniquement lié au taux de défaut moyen puisqu'il n'existe pas de prêteur de dernier recours.En clair, le taux d'intérêt payé par la banque ne sera que le juste compensation de son propre risque de défaut. Les acteurs économiques n'auront donc pas d'avantage particulier à confier leurs fonds à une banque plutôt que de les thésauriser eux-mêmes.Tu essaies de transposer un raisonnement qui pourrait marcher pour une monnaie fiduciaire vers une monnaie commodité. Ça ne marche pas. Non, je me suis fait hacker mes Ripples il y a déjà quelques temps (honte sur moi mon password était faible).Qu'a-t-il de particulier ? Je n'avais essayé que le wallet online il me semble. Je sais. Ça t'aurait valu une fessée et un thread bougé vers "Bases de Bitcoin" pour que quelqu'un de plus patient que moi t'explique la vie.Heureusement nous n'en sommes pas la.Oui, c'est donc bien ce que je dis, c'est que ton contresens fondamental (entre autres) est de considérer des BTC "papier" dépensables au même titre que des BTC "cash".Tu considères implicitement que partout ou un BTC est accepté en paiement, un BTC gox le sera également, ce qui est faux. Tu considères qu'ils sont fongibles ce qui n'est pas le cas. Le contresens fondamental est de considérer que les BTC "dette" sont fongibles avec des BTC. T'es lourd. Il n'y a pas *une* théorie monétaire.Donnez un exemple de solution "technique et purement économique", ça n'a pas le moindre sens... It is indeed a much less scammy behaviour than what's currently happening.That doesn't really work for small orders though, and is actually harder from a technical point of view, than simply increasing the precision of the stored amounts.I think that'd be a good blog post subject, technical and accounting issues related to rounding and the best ways to solve them. Vous avez fumé quoi exactement ? Tellement de confusion dans l'OP ...
Your display of braindamage does not constitute a point in any way.+1 Actually there happens to be a single correct way to fix it.For pretty much the same reason there is one single correct way to count.Their answer is simply magical.  Think more, I already gave the correct solution.What you're suggesting is strictly equivalent to charging the fee at the transaction level, that is because you need to be able to handle partial fills properly. Le rapport de force n'est pas nécessairement à l'avantage de l'administration fiscale, ils vont avoir du mal à te le saisir ton stock... As opposed to what? Intended bugs?Just because something is inconvenient or hard does not mean it should not be done, applying half-assed pseudo band-aids is exactly what you should not do.When you have zero experience in a field, and no valid point to make, your best course of action is usually to refrain from talking. People, please stop being dumb and suggesting retarded fixes.The correct fix is to learn how to fucking count with more decimal places. It has always been this way. And it's been written on their website as far as I can remember. And you didn't notice you were being ripped off? Only their corporate shell is.No, lurk more. C'était en 2011, pas en 2013.L'accusation n'était pas qu'ils n'en faisaient pas "un usage normal" mais qu'ils exercaient illégalement la profession de banquier.Hors-sujet. http://log.bitcoin-assets.com/?date=02-10-2013&bots=true#338159 Je suis assez d'accord. Je pense que dans le cas de paiements reçus en BTC, les vendre en activité annexe (surtout pour une société dans les nouvelles technologies) c'est parfaitement acceptable.Bref, à l'expert-comptable de valider ou pas. Ben si, il les reçoit, et pour les convertir en EUR il les vend. Les conditions me semblent être respectées. La plupart des statuts de société permettent des activités annexes, ce n'est pas vraiment un problème.En l'espèce, la vente de BTC acquis peut constituer une activité annexe, qui peut tout à fait s'analyser comme "Internet & nouvelles technologies" dans le cas qui nous intéresse.Pour ce qui est des charges constatées d'avance, je ne vois pas ce qui permet de comptabiliser une charge sur un exercice arbitraire (hors amortissements bien sur). Vous n'aviez pas un RDV avec l'administration fiscale courant avril au sujet de la TVA ? Non, si tu veux directement l'argent sur une clef le mieux c'est de générer les adresses à partir d'une MPK Electrum.De manière générale les implémentations custom sont assez vulnérables au remplacement des adresses à la volée suite à un hack de serveur. Utilisez plutôt Paymium, c'est gratuit pour l'acceptation de BTC, avec ou sans conversion en EUR avec cours garanti.En plus, ça vous évitera d'avoir à réinventer la roue et vous aurez des jolis reports à donner à votre comptable. C'est très probablement des informations qui sont timestampées.C'est plutôt simple, prendre un tas de données, passer ca au SHA256, utiliser le résultat comme clef privée, envoyer un satoshi vers l'adresse dérivée.Voila, une information timestampée.S'il est nécessaire plus tard de prouver que l'information existait au moment de la transaction on signe un message avec le hash correspondant, qu'on garde privé.
Vous devez facturer en EUR (càd indiquer le HT, la TVA et le TTC), et indiquer une contre-valeur en BTC qui fait office de paiement.À partir de la vous pouvez intégrer les BTC en stock (et certainement pas sur un compte de trésorerie), cf. ce thread.C'est validé par notre expert comptable, charge à vous de faire valider ça par le votre. La tu confonds "distribué" et "décentralisé".Les trackers sont distribués, le partage de pairs entre noeuds est P2P.Peux-tu t'adresser au réseau lui-même pour trouver un torrent arbitraire? Non, à moins de taper au hasard dans tous les pairs auxquels tu es connecté, sans aucune garantie.Sur Bitcoin, la conservation du ledger est distribuée, sa certification, est décentralisée. Tu confonds peer-to-peer et décentralisé. Suivant la même logique un trois étoiles n'est pas compétitif avec le kebab du coin de la rue.Ça tombe bien, ce n'est pas l'objet. Votre comparaison omet deux points très importants : - vous oubliez les volumes, la commission de base sur Bitstamp est de 0.50%, celle que vous mentionnez est valable à partir de 150,000$ mensuels (!), regardez aussi attentivement la politique d'arrondis de Bitstamp, elle peut faire exploser la facture - contrairement à Bitcoin-Central, ces exchanges ne vous ouvrent pas de compte de paiement dédié à votre nom, en cas de faillite de l'exchange c'est extrêmement dangereux, si vous aviez comparé BC avec MtGox vous auriez trouvé des commissions moins élevées chez MtGox, mais au final, le coût global, incluant la perte de fonds chez MtGox, aurait été, et de très loin, à l'avantage de Bitcoin-CentralÀ service et sécurité comparables, Bitcoin-Central est clairement très compétitif. Il est très bon Delamarche !Rencontré en 2012, il n'était pas très sensible au Bitcoin, je me demande si sa position a évolué. Problement refléter leur gloubi-boulga mental.La définition correcte de la monnaie électronique est celle donnée par la directive européenne sur les services de paiement, en très court, une créance sur l'émetteur créé contre la remise de fonds. Les établissements financiers ne sont pas tenus de faire des déclarations à partir de seuils fixes.Si certains en ont ce sont des politiques internes, pas des obligations légales. L'article de net iris n'est pas pertinent, Bitcoin n'est pas considéré comme de la monnaie électronique.Par ailleurs les seuils indiqués s'appliqueraient aux opérations en espèces. Automated Teller Machine = Distributeur Automatique de Billets  The kind of money you forget in your pockets before it gets cleaned with the rest of the laundry hardly qualifies as "an investment". Non, à priori un ATM ne tient pas de comptes en euros, vous n'ouvrez pas de compte pour acheter et/ou vendre surun ATM.Par contre, vous avez l'inconvénient qu'en France vous devez payer de la TVA sur vos ventes, le Bitcoin n'étant pas assimilé à une monnaie.Si le Bitcoin était légalement assimilé à une monnaie, un agrément de bureau de change (simple à obtenir avec 38k de capital minimum) suffirait. Ils indexent par adresse, mais ils ne peuvent pas tout indexer, un script de sortie ne mappe pas nécessairement sur une adresse.Tu peux regarder le code de la branche "addrindex" de bitcoind, Pieter Wuille avait fait un truc comme ca, mais ca n'a pas été mergé dans la branche principale. Tu ne pourras pas indexer l'UTXO complet si tu le fais par adresse. WoT or gtfo  Bon, je crois que je vais donner un exemple pour illustrer ma critique.Vous êtes en train de discuter, avec votre groupe, d'une position à prendre sur un marché.Vous décidez d'aller long avec un ordre au marché. Moi qui ai vent de l'info je me dépêche de vous front-runner, j'achète avant vous, je place ensuite un ask juste au dessus.Vous arrivez, vous vous faites avoir de la différence. Il suffit juste que j'agisse avant vous, assez simple à mettre en oeuvre si vous prenez la décision par consensus sur un chan IRC.C'est pour ca que c'est une mauvaise idée d'investir à plusieurs sur un marché très peu liquide, c'est facile de vous arnaquer, et sur 100 personnes vous en aurez toujours pour tenter.Maintenant que j'y réfléchis il y a un deuxième problème aux décisions d'investissement par consensus : vous n'allez attirer que les losers, les bons eux préfèreront garder les gains pour eux et ne pas les dliuer dans un pot commun.Mauvaise idée. Et c'est bien naturel.Nous avons : d'une part commandé un audit post-incident à une firme de sécurité informatique reconnue, d'autre part déposé plainte à la Befti en avril dernier, la Befti a par ailleurs des copies des disques de nos serveurs sous scellés. Donc je vous rassure, je dors sur mes deux oreilles (enfin, les jours ou j'ai pas une faille openssl à patcher en urgence!).A TA GUISE A TA GUISE. C'est une accusation, ou juste une espèce d'insinuation un peu puante ?Faites un thread séparé, dans place de marché, si vous avez des choses à dire à ce sujet, merci. Au risque de me répéter:
Pas mort d'homme en effet.Le revers de la médaille c'est que la démolition de votre concept se fait également publiquement.Pour lequel vous vous proposez spontanément, et fort généreusement d'être le trésorier.Donc votre truc ne marche que si les 100 gugus qui mettent au pot sont honnêtes? C'est sympa votre truc.Et dans le cas contraire c'est pas grave que tout le monde se fasse plumer, parce qu'à posteriori on pourra "consulter les historiques". Le coup du "j'influence le cours" pirateat40 nous l'avait déjà fait. "Bonjour, je suis le genre de personne qui foule les règles aux pieds, en parfaite connaissance de cause, donnez-moi votre argent".En comptant la marmotte? Le papier d'alu?Bon ben, puisqu'on a plein de visibilité ici, profitons en pour démolir le concept en une seule question : "Qu'est-ce que vous faites si je décide de participer et que je décide d'utiliser les informations que j'ai pour vous front-runner et faire de l'argent sur votre dos?" Non.Soit le magasin fonctionne en mode "j'achète, je revends, et je prends soin d'inclure la TVA en plus de ma marge", soit il fonctionne en dehors du cadre légal. Pour les petits magasins du coin de la rue ca ne pose pas vraiment de problème.Ceci dit, dès que l'activité devient visible vous vous faites rapidement taper sur les doigts.Prenez l'exemple de PriceMinister. Ils ont cru comme vous au début, sauf qu'ils se sont fait emmerder, et maintenant ils ont un numéro d'agrément (cf. leurs CGU) pour la partie "achetez des objets d'occasion".Que la loi soit bonne, mauvaise, utile ou inutile n'est pas vraiment le sujet, elle existe, et elle s'applique. Je me contente simplement de vous présenter les faits, tels qu'ils sont.Dans le cas de la plateforme dont ce thread est l'objet, s'ils ne touchent pas les flux en EUR aucun agrément, license ou déclaration n'est nécessaire. (Comme le disait à juste titre sardokan!) Tu gardes des des EUR pour le compte des gens = tu es régulé par la directive sur les services de paiement.Tu pourrais faire un exchange EUR/navets que ce serait la même chose.La vente de BTC ne nécessite aucune licence particulière. Par contre il faut appliquer la TVA.Exactement comme la vente de navets. "C'est également dans la lettre dite « du Voyant », adressée le 15 mai à Paul Demeny, qu'il exprime sa différence en exposant sa propre quête de la poésie : il veut se faire « voyant », par un « long, immense et raisonné dérèglement de tous les sens »."Source : http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rimbaud Aucun problème, de manière générale, si vous vendez quelque chose, ou si votre post concerne un service à vocation commerciale la partie "Place de marché" est appropriée.Si vous parlez de Bitcoin de manière générale, ou si par exemple vous parlez de livres ayant un rapport avec Bitcoin, alors la catégorie principale est appropriée. À moins bien sur que vous fassiez la promotion de votre propre livre, auquel cas il faut poster dans PdM.Pour ce qui est du livre, il a l'air intéressant ! Ne vous excusez pas, j'ai l'habitude d'entendre des âneries. Pour l'instant on ne s'est pas encore posé la question. Les post OT sont, comme leur nom le laisse présager, destinés à être splittés vers "Hors-sujet"Je vous invite à créer votre propre thread si vous avez des choses à dire.Je n'ai aucun désir de démentir les débilités postée par le premier attardé anonyme venu (ni par les suivants d'ailleurs )Le jour ou on voudra ajouter SPDY on sera de toute façon obligés de recompiler nginx, CQFD. Réponse concernant les éléments factuels :CVE-2014-0133 : Nécessite que le module expérimental SPDY soit compilé dans nginx, ce qui n'est pas le cas.CVE-2013-4547 : Permet de bypasser le contrôle d'accès de la directive "location" via des URL spécialement craftées pour ca. La seule utilisation de la directive "location" que nous faisons est de choisir pour chaque requête : soit renvoi de JS statique, soit reverse-proxy.Le site corporate Paymium hébergé sur un mutu d'OVH est un non-évènement, il y a exactement zéro données confidentielles dessus.Parfois ?La présence du module SPDY était vérifiable de l'extérieur. Vérifier c'est bien, mais vérifier jusqu'au bout, c'est encore mieux Sur ce, je bouge le topic dans PdM. On prend la commission après l'échange, en BTC pour l'acheteur, en EUR pour le vendeur.Prendre la commission au préalable réduirait un peu le volume affiché, de 0,59% exactement :-)C'est le prix moyen par ordre, hors commissions qui est affiché.Ceci dit vous avez accès dans l'interface à toutes les opérations liées à l'exécution de votre ordre, y compris les commissions.Votre compte EUR de trading fonctionne avec 8 décimales, on arrondit à 8 décimales.Quand vos fonds doivent-être débloqués vers votre compte de paiement on tronque et on y transfère un montant à 2 décimales, le reliquat reste sur votre compte de trading pour vos prochains échanges.Absolument C'est même pas une question d'être louche ou pas, c'est simplement que je n'ai rien trouvé dans notre base qui corresponde à l'URL qu'il a donnée.S'il me donne ne serait-ce qu'une adresse de réception je peux non seulement aller checker dans les backups de DB, mais aussi dans les backups de wallets.  On paye ce qu'on doit, je vous invite à lire la discussion dans son entier  Add an exception for this particular certificate so you can access the interface and PM what you see, I'll have a look. Well then, maybe you'll be able to show me your 1000 BTC going into Instawallet, like I requested a while ago. Please, quote stuff that's relevant, don't highlight it like that.Like this for example :It is a well-known French IT-security firm.It has been filed with LE as part of our complaint.There are no plans to publish it, however like I said, it remains available for further investigations if necessary.This is my last answer to you, I'm not interested in arguing this any further, my points have been made. The URL you reported matches no such walllet.In order to look into it deeper I requested some more information about the wallet : public address, blockchain-related information etc.You weren't even able to point me to one, or a set of, transactions funding said wallet that would total to the amount you claim.Such information might have been a first step and allow us to check for its existence.I invested a reasonable amount of time in trying to help you, but as far as our data goes this wallet does not exist.For the record, our server hard-drives were given to law-enforcement when our complaint was filed, if I remember correctly you were given a copy of the receipt.We're not "hiding" anything, neither are we "covering our tracks".The next payout is scheduled for the beginning of june, I'll post more information here whenever it is available and if applicable.

Pour limiter le risque de blanchiment.Les sites de poker en ligne n'ont pas le même problème parce qu'un circuit de blanchiment se verrait tout de suite, il n'y est d'ailleurs pas possible de simplement transférer d'un compte à l'autre.Le fait de pouvoir sortir en BTC démultiplie le risque de fraude, ils ne veulent pas que le risque spécifique à notre activité ne déteigne sur leurs autres services. C'est cela qu'il fallait lire entre les lignes.Si vous insistez on vous l'augmente quand même, c'est votre argent après tout, activer un 2FA c'est tout simplement moins de problèmes pour tout le monde au bout du compte. Les virements SEPA sont difficilement révocables, et ce uniquement pendant 10 jours.La CB en vente à  distance c'est beaucoup plus simple, et les délais sont beaucoup plus longs.Par ailleurs les banques sont tenues d'honorer les demandes d'annulation de paiement CB de leurs clients, elles ne sont pas tenues d'honorer les demandes d'annulation de virement, qui peuvent également être refusées par la banque de destination.Le 3DS est un moyen technique de limiter la fraude en arrivant à ce qui s'appelle un "liability shift" qui passe de l'émetteur vers l'acquéreur s'il est réussi. Conclusion : Une plateforme qui ne permet pas d'acheter des bitcoins malgré ce qui est clairement annoncé (cf. posts précédents),annonce 5000 clients en quelques semaines, difficile à croire avec moins de 20 followers sur son twitter au 29 mars,un administrateur qui publie en ligne des données personnelles (numéro de téléphone) de ses utilisateursÀ ÉVITER Oui enfin, sauf quand tu veux utiliser tes bitcoins, faut pas pousser non plus. Ok, moi ma soeur a une copine qui connaît le mec qui taillait les haies de lova moor, trop swag!"Bonjour monsieur l'agent c'est Kévin à l'appareil, oui vous savez Kévin au bras long, non pas Ryan, Kévin, celui qui a des contacts. J'avais mis un script pour éviter que les gens cliquent droit et sauvegardent les images de mon blogue sur cédérom, j'ai la preuve formelle qu'un internaute a désactivé ce script en allant visualiser les sources de la page, oui monsieur l'agent, le code source." Apprends à lire andouille, c'est à toi qu'il le dit.Sérieux, t'es un gamin de 22 ans qui a fait un facebook clone, qui a, comme tout le monde, commencé l'informatique jeune.La différence c'est qu'ici tu n'as encore rien montré, hormis ce qui ressemble fortement, au mieux à un concept complètement foireux, au pire à un gros scam.Tu parles de 5000 clients en un mois, ton twitter raconte une autre histoire.Donc à part une grande bouche et la capacité à faire trois recherches google, pour l'instant y a pas grand chose.Ah yes merci!C'est collector ce truc. Ah bon d'accord.Ben non, c'est parce que je suis plus vieux, et plus expérimenté que je suis un vieux expérimenté.Si tu cherches un stage envoie nous un CV récent, par contre on fait pas de PHP. Dit-il, du haut de ses 22 ans. "Salut moi c'est Kevin, ca fait trois jours qu'on est en ligne et on s'est toujours pas fait hacker, ca veut dire qu'on est secure hein". Intéressant comme fonctionnement, quel est l'intérêt d'envoyer un support physique par opposition à simplement envoyer les fonds vers une adresse ?Par ailleurs j'attends toujours une réponse à ma question précédente en ce qui concerne la TVA. Utiliser du bitcoin ça veut dire utiliser du bitcoin.Ca veut pas dire envoyer tes points kikoulol en circuit fermé chez des commerçants imaginaires. Ou alors marque le clairement sur ton site "tu peux acheter des bitcoins et les utiliser gratuitement, mais bon, hein, on les garde".Et puis faudra aussi m'expliquer comment vous faites pour avoir 5000 clients et 18 followers (dont moi!)Parce henri99 il est bien gentil, mais à part lui... "utilisez vos bitcoins"
On doit pas avoir la même interprétation de "utiliser vos bitcoins".Donc, clairement, gros scam.À éviter. QFL Wouah. C'est un gros gros scam votre truc.Quand vous mettez en front-page "utilisez facilement et gratuitement vos bitcoins" ca veut dire que vous promettez de pouvoir utiliser des bitcoins, des vrais, pas des promesses en circuit fermé. Ca revient au même il me semble. Entendu!Je n'ai jamais dit que c'était honteux, j'ai simplement dit que ce que vous présentiez comme un soutien de la région, en laissant entendre qu'il s'agissait d'un soutien à l'activité bitcoin, n'était en fait qu'un soutien d'ordre plus général.Au temps pour moi, j'ai confondu incubateur et pépinière, le propos n'en reste pas moins que le déplacement de PM n'a rien à voir avec l'activité que vous nous présentez aujourd'hui :-)Je ne vois pas trop ce que mon statut de modérateur vient faire dans cette discussion, je n'ai pas menacé de vous modérer ou de vous censurer que je sache, même si je ne suis pas d'accord avec vous. Si vous ne souhaitez pas discuter, un forum est probablement le mauvais endroit pour parler de votre service.Ca va vous paraître bizarre, mais c'est ce que je suis en train de faire en vous passant au gril.Parce que figurez-vous que cette expérience de vente directe je l'ai déjà faite, c'est un service qui n'existe plus et qui s'appelait instawire qui permettait d'acheter des bitcoins par virement.Je me permets donc de re-poser la question à laquelle vous n'avez pas répondu: "avez-vous une exemption de TVA explicite qui vous permette de n'asseoir la taxe que sur votre commission et non sur le montant total de la vente ?".Vous avez tout à gagner à être transparent, c'est d'ailleurs obligatoire la plupart du temps pour ce genre de choses (cf. les mentions que doivent mettre les auto-entrepreneurs sur leurs factures par exemple). Avec un code NAF qui ne correspond pas à votre activité...Oui, en clair vous êtes juste incubés quoi.Il y a exactement zéro vide juridique autour de la TVA.À défaut d'exemption explicite, le taux normal est applicable de plein droit, l'assiette n'est pas laissée à la libre appréciation du vendeur.Donc je vous pose la question clairement : est-ce que oui ou non vous bénéficiez d'une exemption explicite ?L'ACP et la BdF vous ont dit en substance que ce n'était pas de leur ressort étant donné que vous ne faisiez pas de tenue de compte.De la à venir le présenter comme un blanc-seing c'est un peu limite.Vous avez vraiment un don pour mettre un éclairage fantaisiste sur les choses...Il est simplement venu inaugurer votre incubateur.Non, ils n'ont pas "validé votre activité", ce qu'ils ont dit est que cela ne relevait pas de la fourniture d'une service de paiement ou de monnaie électronique nécessitant agrément. C'est ce qu'ils disent depuis un certain temps déjà.Attendez votre premier contrôle fiscal, je pense que vous allez le sentir passer si vous continuez de prendre la liberté de prendre l'assiette qui vous arrange :-)Je parlais des délais d'opposition sur chèque qui sont prévus par le code monétaire et financier, ce sont bien ceux-ci, et non les délais de rétractation, qui présentent un risque majeur pour votre activité. Vous allez vous faire démolir par l'administration fiscale.Pour rappel le Bitcoin ne bénéficie pas d'une exemption de TVA quelle qu'elle soit, la TVA normale s'applique donc, sur le montant total de la transaction.Il n'est pas impossible que l'administration fiscale prenne, à terme, une position inverse. Mais en attendant vous prenez un risque énorme.Vous voulez dire quoi exactement par ça ?Non, vous savez ou vous avez livré.Pour rappel le délai légal pour l'annulation d'un chèque est de plus d'un an. Ok, donc TVA et tout.Sous-entendu vous devez pas marger tant que ça, et vous m'avez quand même l'air de prendre un gros risque sur le chèque.Et méfiez-vous aussi du 3DS. Même avec un 3DS réussi le liability shift n'est pas garanti dans tous les cas. Vous délivrez des factures ?EDIT : Quand j'ai vu que vous acceptiez le paiement par chèque voila ce qui m'a traversé la tête. Hahaha très bon! C'est normal, c'est que ça a pas encore du bien rentrer.Lis la référence que je t'ai donnée, elle est pas la pour faire joli. C'est intéressant ton truc, tu files une facture à l'achat ? Quelqu'un qui n'a ni nom, ni expérience, n'a rien à conseiller.Quand plusieurs personnes différentes, avec beaucoup, beaucoup plus d'expérience que toi, te disent que c'est une mauvaise idée, alors l'attitude correcte est de fermer la bouche et d'ouvrir très grand les oreilles, à la rigueur demander quelques précisions.Reviens dans six mois, en attendant je te suggère une saine lecture. I will say he's René Magritte. You got this one backwards, they say it's virtual currency, that's taxed like property.In other words it's a hippo that's taxed like an elephant, go figure.It is however undecided whether the hippo is stronger than the elephant or if it's the other way around.I'd personnally bet on the hippo. Si, moi je veux bien.Très mauvaise idée. Parfait, court et direct, merci En clair, la compta en stock est ce qui se fait, dans de vraies entreprises. C'est un retour d'expérience que je donne, il est normatif, et non pas ouvert au débat. Juste pour information, la comptabilisation en stock n'est pas ce je pense être possible mais c'est ce qui se fait.Avec la bénédiction de l'expert-comptable, qui lui est un professionnel du domaine.Rien ne s'oppose à ce que ce qui est par défaut un bien meuble incorporel fongible, soit comptabilisé comme tout autre stock. Non, c'est particulièrement pertinent pour une société qui thésaurise du BTC.Les problèmes de TVA c'est encore autre chose, si c'est un problème alors ça l'est au moment de la liquidation. Such contradiction.
Because it's true, duh. Nice ! En mode "stock" tu ne calcule ta plus/moins value qu'au moment ou tu liquides, c'est à dire que tu vends ton stock.Tes BTC peuvent prendre en valeur sur plusieurs années sans que tu n'aies besoin de constater de profit latent à chaque fin d'exercice.En mode "valeur mobilière" tu constates un gain ou une perte à chaque fin d'exercice, même si tu ne liquides pas. Tu pourrais te retrouver à devoir vendre des BTC pour payer l'IS résultant d'un profit qui était latent.C'est le principe même de la tenue de comptabilité, tu enregistres des informations pour les re-traiter plus tard Tu factures en EUR, tu comptabilise l'entrée de BTC en acquisition de stock au cours utilisé pour le paiement.Au moment ou tu liquide tes BTC tu comptabilise une p/p sur dépréciation/appréciation de stock.Ne pas comptabiliser le BTC comme devise, ca t'oblige à l'évaluer à sa valeur de marché à chaque fin d'exercice et à constater une p/p sur chaque exercice.En mode "stock" c'est plus souple, si tu as des acquisitions de stock de BTC à des cours différents tu les liquides en FIFO pour le calcul de la plus/moins value. Yup, the spread/depth on the X.EUR market should improve soon :-) You can trade any asset on margin according to the FAQ. I'd consider stopping something before a failure to ultimately be a win. OTOH it's not like the feed operators owe anyone jackshit. Pour information  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361852.0 Hah, c'est vieux ca!À cette époque la il n'y avait que mtgox (avec Jed McCaleb aux commandes), et btc-eDe l'eau a coulé sous les ponts depuis  Ça m'a l'air d'être une excellente idée. Last month was a little special I'd say  Oui, j'y travaille en ce moment-même :-) Oui, en plus je me suis bien trompé, je pensais à du LIFO, pas du FIFO.  Non, vous avez mal compris.Perl: Un pourcentage, c'est ça un haircut uniforme.Je pensais à un remboursement FIFO ou les derniers à avoir alimenté leur compte sont les premiers à être remboursés, pas à un haircut avec un pourcentage dégressif suivant le montant. Non, la je n'achète plus.Ton évaluation ne me semble pas délirante.Je pense pas qu'il soit impossible qu'il y ait un haircut, ceci dit je ne pense pas qu'il serait uniforme.  - Délais de paiement massifs en fiat, - Gel de fonds aux US - Tous ceux avec un cerveau avaient quitté gox depuis 2011 - Leurs problèmes règlementaires divers (France, US notamment) - etc etc etcC'est pas de la rocket science comme on dit... Yep.Un gros paquet je dirais.Extrait des logs de #mtgox-otc, aucun trade ne s'est fait parce que j'ai toujours offert en dessous de ce que proposait le marché, faut croire que j'avais raison ;-)Le 20/02Le 21/02Le 24/02 J'en connais un qui avait fait un pari risqué :-)C'est le petit jésus qui te punit pour ta signature
Delamarche est à écouter absolument. \o\ \o/ /o/ Je me fais tirer mes thunes. Ca doit être de la faute des thunes. bwhahaha No, you should approve the payout offered with regards to the claim you made during the claims period, if any. JFGI You need to approve your payout, please note that you won't be able to access your claim without the "www" prepended to the URL.Once your payout is approved you'll be scheduled for inclusion in the next batch.There is currently no date set in stone for the next payout batch. In cauda venenum. Je ne sais pas si un rescan te les retrouvera.Mais théoriquement ils ne sont pas perdus, tu peux toujours réimporter la private key dans un autre wallet, voire crafter un double-spend à la main. Tout ce que vous saisissez est, une fois le dossier complet, envoyé à Lemon Way. Vous êtes sur? Il me semble qu'au pire on ait reporté un paiement au lendemain matin.Pour ce qui est du process, on sort les données en automatique, et ensuite c'est la qu'on audite, qu'on échantillonne, qu'on vérifie les gros, les moyens montants. On vérifie l'activité de la journée, on vérifie qu'il n'y a pas d'anomalie statistique par rapport au jour de la semaine concerné etc.En gros, on fait très attention, tous les soirs.Et c'est aussi une des raisons pour lesquelles on ne fait pas ca le week end, parce qu'on veut être à ce qu'on fait et le faire correctement. Oui, c'est en général.Des fois le paiement part à 18h, des fois 21h, il nous arrive de temps à autre de ne l'envoyer que le lendemain matin. Le soir, à partir de 18h, en général avant 21h. Oui, c'est un problème. J'y avais réfléchi avant que tu entendes parler de Ripple.Et j'exagère pas :-) Je pense que tu te méprends sur mon opinion de Ripple. "Meeting the need for online interactions that are ephemeral." Un cageot surévalué reste un cageot. Je remarque surtout que SnapChat est 12e, tout de suite ça fait moins rêver.Aussi, Ripple ca va dans "Altcoins", tu devrais le savoir depuis le temps. Excellente suggestion !J'invoque notre front-end engineer.Tu parles de l'app iPhone? Je me suis toujours servi de bnpnet (ouèbe), c'est moche mais j'ai jamais vu de bugs particuliers.Ceci dit on est bien d'accord, les API Rest (comme le faisait remarquer pankkake) ca n'existe que chez Axa Banque pour l'instant. Question de temps principalement.
Moi c'est David. Et non désolé. Notre opinion est que les fonds volés à cause d'une session mal fermée ça baisse tout suite l'expérience utilisateur moyenne.Seule l'API permet de faire des choses comme ça, sauf que sur les tokens d'API il faut explicitement autoriser les retraits.S'ils sont la depuis des années c'est peut-être qu'ils ne sont pas si incompétents que ca C'est volontaire.Si vous voulez une plateforme à la sécurité médiocre vous n'avez que l'embarras du choix.Mais méfiez vous, il risque de ne vous rester que l'embarras :-) http://mpex.co/mpex-mktdepth.php Pas de problème, nous c'est la sécurité, et c'est assumé ;-) Si, justement, sur notre Twitter, celui qu'on vous invite à suivre dans chaque e-mail qu'on envoie.Quel est le problème exactement? Pour rappel les limites sont modifiables, il y a simplement un délai de 24h avant leur prise en compte pour des raisons de sécurité. On va dire qu'il augmente pas linéairement.Pas de bras, pas de chocolat   Trop important pour?Notre procédure ne change pas en fonction du nombre de retraits quotidiens, on fait un batch par jour, qu'il contienne une transaction ou 50000. Pour info, notre nouveau blog : blog.bitcoin-central.net Rebuild de cache forcé du à Redis qui prenait trop de RAM si tu veux tout savoir ;-) La malléabilité des ID de transaction n'a jamais été un problème pour Bitcoin-Central.C'est l'affaire de l'expéditeur de toute façon, donc tant que vous recevez vos fonds vous pouvez partir du principe que c'est notre problème.Pour ce qui est de la nouvelle limite de retrait ça a été annoncé longtemps à l'avance. Non Lol, who are you? and what's with the butthurt? Have a xanax. J'ai parlé de TVA, pas de charges sociales, c'est encore autre chose.Troquer des objets sans valeur intrinsèque ça n'a pas de sens, sinon tu ne les troquerais pas, si tu troques de la crypto-monnaie contre quelque chose qui a une valeur de marché faut pas prendre le fisc pour des idiots en prétendant que la crypto-monnaie n'a aucune valeur.Effectivement si c'est à titre occasionnel t'auras aucun problème, maintenant si t'as une plateforme d'échange tu pourras difficilement dire que ce n'est pas à titre habituel que tu intermédies du troc.Juste mes 200000 DOGE. Ce n'est pas si simple, règlementairement le troc a des implications en terme de TVA par exemple. voila, à garder en tête ca :-) Oui oui, je suis entièrement d'accord avec le contraire de ce que tu dis :3Tu vas avoir des problèmes toi :-) Ce qui n'est pas interdit est autorisé... Moi je veux bien que tu me linke un article de wikipedia, par contre tu prendras juste le temps de le lire avant la prochaine fois, ça me fera gagner du temps.Tiré de ton article: Franchement? Pas la moindre idée.
Pourquoi ce serait illégal ? Euh non.Non plus, ils font juste attention à la personne qui les paye avec une promesse. Encore une fois, Ripple transfère de la dette, Bitcoin transfère du cash. Apples and oranges. Ben un chèque c'est un exemple parfait.Ripple ça bouge des IOU, rien de plus, ce en quoi OpenTransactions lui semble largement supérieur, mais ça c'est un autre débat qui ne m'intéresse pas vraiment.Absolument pas, c'était vrai pendant le gold standard, mais plus maintenant.Ou alors il faut m'expliquer à quoi ça te donne droit. Ouvrez-nous un ticket pour ca, si c'est pressé vous pouvez toujours aller voir dans les e-mails d'autorisation qui vous sont envoyés à chaque retrait.  On a un problème avec https://www.bitcoin-central.net, le site reste accessible via https://bitcoin-central.netVous êtes sur ma TODO, j'ai pris un peu de retard aujourd'hui et reviens vers vous rapidement. C'est la différence entre une créance sur une société (Ripple et dépôts sur Bitstamp) et une créance sur un établissement financier (dépôts chez Bitcoin-Central).Personnellement je préfère que ce soit un établissement financier qui me doive de l'argent plutôt qu'une société tenue par deux jeunes slovènes, même si elle a les meilleures intentions du monde.Justement non, chez Bitstamp les fonds sont mélangés sur leur compte corporate et peuvent être saisis en cas de problème avec la société Bitstamp pour rembourser un de leurs créanciers, les fonds leur appartiennent légalement. Pas chez Bitcoin-Central, ils sont sur un compte de paiement (ouvert en direct auprès d'un établissement financier) qui n'est pas à nous mais à l'utilisateur.Tu peux aussi proposer un bien ou un service, ou dealer en cash en direct, tu as toujours le choix.Non, il n'y a aucun intérêt à s'endetter en BTC, plus le temps passera plus il sera difficile de rembourser, ce qui est exactement l'inverse pour un prêt libellé en EUR.Bitcoin encouragera l'accumulation de capital, en d'autres termes il faudra avoir de l'argent avant de le dépenser.Si tu veux corriger les autres il faut mieux te renseigner, la maison-mère est Italienne mais leur banque est Slovène ;-)Ceci dit, comme tu le soulignes, elle est en zone Euro.Et non ce qui importe c'est ou sont déposés les fonds des clients, qui en est légalement le propriétaire. Tu ne réponds pas à la question, que se passe-t-il avec les fonds en EUR dans le cas d'une faillite de la société ou de tout autre problème qui lui impose un besoin pressant de cash ? Nous n'avons pas spécialement envie d'intégrer Ripple.On a exactement zéro demande d'une part. D'autre part on fait les choses proprement, ce qui veut dire qu'on se renseigne sur les implications de ce qu'on fait.Émettre du Ripple EUR c'est émettre de la monnaie électronique, au sens de la directive Européenne sur les services de paiement, ce qui nécessite d'être établissement de crédit ou établissement de monnaie électronique (ce qui est différent d'être établissement de paiement).Travailler de manière propre ça a des inconvénients, notamment le fait d'avoir moins de volume à cause d'une procédure d'inscription plus difficile, mais ça a l'avantage de protéger les fonds des clients, de pouvoir moins facilement se faire fermer du jour au lendemain etc.On est la depuis 2010 (pour rappel nous sommes le plus ancien exchange derrière BTC-E et MtGox) et on compte bien le rester.Bitstamp a pris le parti de travailler avec des fonds sur leur compte corporate, sans respecter les contraintes imposées par le règlementation européenne. Ils font beaucoup de volume maintenant, mais quand ils se feront fermer pour non-respect de ladite législation ou quand UniCredit se réveillera ça fera mal, très mal. Et aux clients aussi parce que les fonds sur le compte de Bitstamp sont considérés comme étant propriété de Bitstamp, et pas des clients. Chez nous, les fonds sont déposés sur des comptes de paiement, auprès d'un établissement de paiement, au nom du client, et donc indépendant de nos comptes corporate.Pour conclure je vais laisser un petit exercice au lecteur : "demain BC et Bitstamp font faillite, que se passe-t-il avec les fonds des clients ?" Envoyez-moi votre numéro de compte en MP Les deux principales causes de retard sont : - Numéro de compte incorrect, ou omis dans le champ commentaire - Virement effectué depuis un compte autre que le compte déclaré à l'inscriptionOuvrez un ticket si ce n'est pas déjà fait.

Tu cherches un job ? C'est le reliquat qu'on ne peut pas créditer sur ton compte de paiement, dès que ça dépasse un centime on le re-crédite.La somme de tous ces montants, chez tous nous clients, somme à une valeur multiple d'un centime Yep, that was the part I missed, I thought they were bought It's in the log Isn't it? If you have the option to sell at a given strike, the option is worthless if the spot is above the strike and is profitable if the spot is below the strike (minus the purchase cost of the option). It's the opposite. Seriously, what is it you're so butthurt about? Unfortunately we won't be able to make January for this payout, there is still some more work to do before it can be sent.It will be broadcast during the next two weeks though.My apologies about that.
 Relisez les CGU, vous trouverez le nom de l'EP à chercher ;-) Because you weren't there yet. Le cut-off est vers 17h30 en général. Tu vas la sentir passer la quenelle si tu te fais contrôler en France ... Oh look, a bitbet shill ! Ce n'est pas sale. Dites le qu'il faut que ce soit comme sur Bitstamp, n'ayez pas peur :-D Pas encore, mais on va proposer quelque chose bientôt pour faciliter le processus. Mieux ? C'était Gonzague qui parlait :-)Moi j'étais planqué derrière avec boussac, hors-champ de la caméra :-) Fear not for I'm from the internet. I'll offer a bitcent. Numéro de compte dans les champs obligatoires, le reste vide :-)Pour les mails d'autorisation c'est réglé. Pour info boussac aka Pierre Noizat de chez Paymium/Bitcoin-Central y interviendra en compagnie de Philippe Herlin, chargé de cours aux Arts et Métiers If this becomes the first legally forbidden coin in France we may learn a lot from it. Comment fais-tu si tu as un deuxième facteur d'authentification ? L'image ne passe pas.HTTP Basic ca pue, et surtout ça ne marche plus dès que tu as un deuxième facteur d'authentification C'était assez mortel, ce que j'ai trouvé le plus drôle c'est la paire de baffes à peine voilée que Philippe Marini a mis au directeur des opérations de la Banque de France.L'intervention de Cornu était chiante à mourir, d'ailleurs si tu regardes bien la vidéo tu verras qu'entre cinq et dix personnes sont allées pisser pendant qu'il parlait.Enfin bon, globalement ils voient bien qu'il y a un truc à faire, certains aimeraient bien que ça n'ait jamais été inventé, d'autres regardent ça avec plus d'intérêt. De manière générale ils voient qu'il y a un truc à faire mais ne savent pas encore vraiment quoi. Vous vous trompez.L'huissier à qui nous avons parlé à la fin nous a dit que c'était la première fois qu'il voyait autant de journalistes pour une audition :-)Si quelqu'un sait ou récupérer un enregistrement je suis intéressé.
Quand tu thésaurise un bien économique autre qu'une monnaie, l'objet est justement de réduire ton exposition à la fluctuation de valeur de cette monnaie. En beta publique depuis quelques jours, on a pas encore communiqué dessus mais elle est déployée.https://github.com/Paymium/api-documentationSi ton dada c'est nodejs alors t'as de la chance il y a un client fonctionnel avec une CLI dans le dossier... "examples" :-)Have fun ! No seriously, I'll open an account too if you manage to do what your big mouth said you would.Get cracking now, or else in a year you'll look back and bang your head against the wall for turning down a 40 BTC for 15 hours of work salary. Non, il est parfaitement possible de thésauriser autre chose qu'une monnaie. Ce n'est pas "eu" qu'il faut utiliser c'est "trouvée".Par ailleurs j'insiste, vous avez reçu une réponse, regardez dans votre dossier spam. Bon, le sujet sur France 2 était bien pourri :-)L'absence sur le forum principale était voulue, jusqu'à la dernière minute on ne sait pas vraiment ce qui passe ou pas au JT. Si vous êtes bien la personne à laquelle je pense (celle qui a fait une vingtaine de virements de 500 en quelques jours) sachez d'une part que votre limite de retrait est modifiable sur simple demande et d'autre part que je vous ai répondu par mail hier ou avant-hier. Ils commencent à la sentir. Ça m'étonnerait qu'ils nous la posent, la réponse serait trop facile et n'arrangerait pas forcément leurs affaires.Aucune idée. Ca fait déjà longtemps qu'on a rencontré les gens que nous verrons au sénat, leurs positions nous les connaissons déjà, rien de neuf de ce côté la.L'important c'est qu'on parle de Bitcoin, car plus on en parle, en bien ou en mal, plus les gens font la démarche de s'éduquer.C'est le fait qu'une des assemblées françaises s'intéresse à ce petit phénomène qui est réellement important, car ça valide implicitement la place incontournable qu'aura cette innovation au cours des prochaines années. En d'autres termes ça communique le message que ne pas avoir d'opinion n'est pas une option, qu'on ne peut pas juste ignorer les crypto-monnaies. On a déjà gagné avant d'y aller.Sans transition et sauf changement de dernière minute il y a un reportage sur Bitcoin ce soir au JT de France 2 à 20h. En compagnie de la direction de la Banque de France, celle de Tracfin, et celle de la cyber-douane.Plus d'informations : http://www.senat.fr/presse/cp20140109a.html C'est encore mieux que ca.Vous envoyez de l'argent sur le compte d'un établissement de paiement, pas sur le notre, si Paymium fait faillite vos fonds sont protégés. C'est la vie, quand on achète une baguette on paye à chaque fois.Et oui, nous prenons une commission, pour acheter nos baguettes, qui nous servent à nourrir nos enfants, qui comme chacun sait, mangent tous les jours, trois repas par jour :-) Stickied. L'avis de la BdF est assez clair : "cette activité [s'analyse] comme la fourniture de services de paiement et [nécessite] lobtention dun agrément détablissement de paiement".En l'espèce c'est le cas via notre partenariat avec un l'EP Français LemonWay.Quel est votre numéro de compte. Envoyez-moi votre n° de compte BC en MP SVP. That's a good practice, with unexpiring addresses you monitor a constantly growing set. You need to monitor the addresses on which you are expecting payments.This can be achieved in a variety of ways, blockchain has an API, you could plug in to an electrum server, do some polling, it really depends on your use case.Another suggestion : don't allow addresses to be valid permanently if possible, tell your users the addresses have a finite lifetime, so you can rotate the master public seeds regularly. What's best for security and performance is to not use bitcoind at all.Generate your adresses deterministically instead, dem libs are out there. Super intéressant, je viens de passer une bonne heure sur wikipedia à lire sur la bdf, la compagnie perpétuelle des indes, le système de law.Je me coucherai moins con.
                               Ce forum                                                        Très lobby     Quelle propagande                   Nombreux médias                                                              Wow Ta participation constructive peut-être (et je ne dis pas ça de manière condescendante ou péjorative).C'est tout l'esprit du logiciel libre en général. J'ai, en effet, une Skoda Fabia (et un Suzuki SV650 que je préfère largement) Uniquement aux agents secrets  Passez prendre un café, vous en profiterez pour vous présenter  Pas d'erreur, ceci dit le lobbying est également connoté négativement.Le mot le moins connoté qui me paraisse avoir sensiblement le même sens est "évangélisation" (au sens nouvelles technologies bien sûr).C'est une bonne remarque. En vérité, je pense que si vous avez du mal à la décrire c'est peut-être tout simplement qu'elle n'existe pas plus que la communauté de possesseurs de Skoda Fabia, ils aiment tous leur Skoda, ou pas, et ont tous des raisons différentes d'en posséder une. Il y a un forum, certes, mais je pense que c'est largement insuffisant pour constituer une communauté. Vous m'avez l'air d'accorder un peu trop d'importance à ce que pensent les gens :-P Le prosélytisme n'est pas nécessairement religieux ou doctrinaire. Détends-toi.Punk à chien, écologiste alter-mondialiste ou plutôt fête de l'huma?C'est parce que tu es encore un peu nouveau ici ;-) T'es bien curieux toi. Les mots ont un sens, le mot que tu cherches est "prosélyte", pas "lobbyiste".Le prix est une des composantes les moins intéressantes du Bitcoin, ceux qui cherchent à s'enrichir finissent souvent plumés.Les premiers seront les derniers. Amen. Rétro-lol.Non, les fonds sur compte de paiement ne sont pas garantis par le fonds de garantie des dépôts. (une des différences entre un compte de paiement et un compte de dépôt, qu'on appelle aussi couramment un compte bancaire).La protection la plus importante est que les fonds sont déposés chez un établissement de paiement, pas dans nos comptes, en clair si on fait faillite votre argent est sain et sauf.Le fond de garantie des dépôts c'est vraiment si la BNP met la clef sous la porte, je pense que vous aurez d'autres soucis à ce moment la.Envoyez moi votre numéro de compte je pousserai votre vérification. Nan. Good one. C'est un peu ça, sauf que l'objectif n'est pas de faire redescendre le prix, mais de revendre en haut. Yes. It is established.Now shut up and listen to good advice being given to you, free of charge.I'm interested in seeing how this Bitcoin Bourse thing will unfold, the guy seems like an absolute idiot with no clue whatsoever. such butthurt                          what faggotrywow        much self-mod Nous allons retravailler cet écran pour qu'il soit plus informatif.L'idée des adresses de dépôt est qu'elles sont prévues pour servir uniquement à des dépôts, dans le sens ou elles ne sont pas prévues pour recevoir un paiement.La différence entre un dépôt et un paiement est que le paiement est initié par un tiers, alors que pour un dépôt c'est à votre initiative.Ceci dit vous avez raison, il serait souhaitable d'afficher plus d'informations. Je vous ai demandé via Twitter de répondre sur un ticket en précisant qu'il y avait erreur sur la gestion du problème, vous ne l'avez pas fait.Ce n'est pas un reproche ou une déformation des faits, c'est simplement que notre staff de support peut se tromper, ce qui a manifestement été le cas pour vous, dans ce cas la, la meilleure marche à suivre est de le leur indiquer afin qu'ils relisent de manière plus attentive votre message.Bonne continuation et bonne chance également. Effectivement, j'ai fini par réussir à lire un bout de votre nom à travers le flou de votre screenshot et je confirme que la photo du pape ce n'est pas vous.Ceci étant dit, si vous ne donnez aucune information permettant de vous identifier, et que vous refusez de suivre nos indications pour débloquer votre cas (répondre sur le ticket et indiquer une erreur dans le traitement) je ne vois vraiment pas comment il serait possible de vous aider.Vous m'expliquez? Je suis curieux de savoir :-) I neither said nor implied that you were a liar.I said that if you favor the display of drama and butthurt over logic then this conversation is over.Go to your room, come back when you've calmed down.
Learn to count, I'll restate them for your convenience. No answer, no conversation.Getting all agitated, and dramatic: much easier than constructing an actual argument that makes actual sense.Oldest manipulation trick in the fucking book. Mostly used by women and children though.You signing-off on it is not required for the earth to keep spinning. No matter how butthurt that makes you feel.It really wasn't necessary to edit your post.Seriously, spare us the "you should be the one caring about where I leave my own money" type of argument. To be fair too, I'm not in the "working on it" phase yet.  Still in the "collecting factual information" phase. I'll try to update you this week.I asked you a couple of questions which you ignored. If you want a conversation, then converse. If you want a monologue then you don't need me.If you, a bitcointalk regular, want to blame me for not finding five minutes in three months to make a claim, then go for it, blame me. C'est assez classique que les montants en jeu sur un ordre soient prélevés au moment du passage de l'ordre, et que le solde soit fait au moment de l'arrêt.Jdcjdr je n'ai pas de compte cryptsy, je ne sais pas comment ils fonctionnent Not really, staff gets paid with cold hard BTC. Investigating the missing wallet cases is on my todo.Correct reports submitted before the deadline will, of course, be treated like proper claims.I won't promise a time frame but be assured my interest and desire is aligned with getting this over with ASAP.Cheers! Après je peux me planter parce que la personne ne m'a donné aucune information identifiante.Mais si je croise tout ce que j'ai, les dates, prénoms, tickets et statut alors je tombe sur ce profil. Un bien crade alors  Ah oui, vous êtes la personne à qui on a demandé de répondre sur le ticket ouvert, et ou vous nous avez répondu "je ne pense pas que ça fasse avancer les choses" c'est bien ça ?Et non, le site est loin d'être récent, vous imaginez beaucoup. Le support est la pour vous aider, si tant est que vous souhaitiez réellement l'être.EDIT: Renseignements pris, votre ouverture de compte a été refusée par notre établissement de paiement pour le motif suivant : "a envoyé une photo du pape en guise d'ID, radié".Pour référence, l'ID en question : Je pense qu'il y a une opportunité pour une place de marché. T'as ton permis A? On peut acheter du cash avec du cash. 1=1. Bravo.  wtf is that? Vous êtes encore la? Je ne sais pas moi, allez regarder la télé, y a pas un truc à regarder sur TF1? Essayez juste d'éviter la dictée de Pivot.Vous pourrez me trouver aux meetups parisiens, sinon c'est sur rendez-vous. Bon, je vous laisse, j'ai du travail.Ah oui, je pense que vous ne vous en êtes pas rendu compte, mais vous l'avez déjà prise la paire de claques  Moi le jour ou j'en ai acheté à 0.80 (le cours était à 0.60$), les gens ont cru que bitcoin-central.net déconnait en voyant passer les trades dans #bitcoin-market tellement ça paraissait cher :-P Tout ça est très intéressant. Ceci dit j'ai à peu près autant envie de parler business avec vous que j'ai envie de parler thermodynamique avec mon labrador.Je vous invite donc à rester à votre place et laisser les professionnels travailler si vous ne voulez pas vous y faire remettre avec une paire de claques bien méritée.Cela a également un autre avantage non négligeable, ça permet d'envoyer à la concurrence les gens qui demandent beaucoup de temps, font beaucoup de bruit et qui monopolisent finalement l'attention du support, au détriment de la majorité des autres clients. En clair, en mettant des coups de boule de temps en temps, on se détend, on éloigne les relous, et on améliore globalement la qualité de service pour tout le monde. Elle est pas belle la vie?  On reproche souvent ses propres défauts aux autres Ben non, le monsieur a demandé, et il a été aidé. Mais bon, y a souvent que les râleurs qu'on entend... Le décalage entre qu'il y a entre la réalité et votre imagination c'est votre problème, pas le mien. Not to nitpick, but after a couple of weeks I wouldn't consider them "brand new" anymore :-)Either way, good luck with all this. Le délai est légalement borné, renseignez-vous. Sinon merci d'enfoncer les portes ouvertes :-) Si vous avez compris cette phrase ne prenez pas la route.
Intéressant, merci d'avoir partagé!Gardez toutefois à l'esprit qu'un mail n'a pas la même valeur qu'un rescrit. Bonne journée et bonne chance également monsieur! Two other possibilities :Your machine is compromised (you seem a bit quick to shrug this one off)Someone at Cloudflare decided to have some hookers & blow  No. You mix up limited liability and the legal system.They are orthogonal issues. La corrélation n'implique pas la causalité, vous surestimez votre pouvoir de nuisance ;-) There is no absolute "proper way", it all depends on what you want to do with it and how you want to use it.The "cute" means there are much, much lighter ways to achieve this, again, depending on your intended usage. Cute Yes, companies act in their own interest, so do I and so should you.Non-broken capitalism encourages proper allocation of capital. In a non-broken system that is not based on debt it usually benefits everyone.But hey I'm just some random retard on some random internet trollboard, read up, become an entrepreneur, see for yourself. Merci pour la source!Quand vous allez demander la seller protection pour une clef USB que vous avez vendu $3000 parce qu'elle contient 3 BTC je me demande ce qu'il va se passer. Ca reste un "loophole" qui ne tiendra pas 30 secondes dès qu'ils commenceront à fouiller. Et PP aura une très forte incitation à fouiller après que son assurance se soit mangé deux ou trois chargebacks.On fait le test si vous voulez, je vous file mon adresse en PM et je vous en achète un 20% au dessus du cours ;-) Investors and shareholders are not these "evil people that somehow live separate from society and profit at its expense and that I wish I'd be a part of". Qu'est-ce qu'il faut pas entendre...S'il reste encore des opportunités d'arbitrage c'est qu'elles sont très compliquées à mettre en oeuvre pour tout un tas de raisons.Que les flux de BTC soient liquides, c'est une chose, que les flux bancaires le soient en est une autre, et l'arbitrage ne peut se faire sans les deux. Simultanément.Il y aura toujours une limite sur la mobilité de l'actif le moins liquide, en l'occurrence le fiat. Ca fait des années que je suis dans le Bitcoin et ca fait des annés que j'entends, "whoa, je me faire trop de thunes en faisant de l'arbitrage".Pour l'administration fiscale, vous allez entendre ici tout et son contraire. La réponse correcte, et honnête est : "je ne sais pas, ceci dit si vous voulez savoir il faut vous rapprocher de l'administration fiscale, idéalement via la procédure du rescrit fiscal".Comme vous dites : "vous avez lu un truc la dessus". C'est comme l'arbitrage, j'en ai entendu un paquet des "whoa, j'ai trouvé le truc pour éviter de me faire niquer par paypal" :-)Rpietila est un allumé. Il a d'ailleurs séjourné un petit bout de temps en HP. Après ses techniques font peut-être sens. Ceci dit pose toi la question de savoir pourquoi il ne le met pas en oeuvre pour lui-même plutôt que de réduire ses opportunités en en parlant si elles sont si bien. Même arbitrer.La solution correcte pour arbitrer c'est d'avoir du capital sur tous les exchanges ou tu veux arbitrer.Si tu n'as pas le capital pour le faire comme cela tu te feras avoir de toutes façon par des mecs qui font comme ca et qui n'auront pas l'inconvénient de devoir attendre X confirmations pour voir leur crédit réalisé.Nous sommes un exchange, pas un wallet, qu'on se le dise :-) The voices may not be real, but they have pretty good ideas. Ravi de vous avoir appris quelque chose, pour la clôture du compte la procédure est indiquée dans la FAQ.Allez, bisous  C'est tous les soirs en effet, par l'heure varie d'un soir sur l'autre et dépend du temps que nous mettons à effectuer l'audit quotidien. Je pense que vous étiez mieux dans la banque, les choses y sont déjà pré-réfléchies pour vous :-)Pour les "achats urgents" (parce que oui, j'en ai vu un paquet passer des "achats urgents") je vous invite soit à vous organiser, soit à vous faire désintoxiquer.On s'en reparle dans six mois, en attendant lisez les FAQs, c'est comme faire pipi, personne ne peut le faire à votre place.À bon entendeur salut <3 Oui oui, le service tel qu'il est ne sera pas facturé, ce n'est pas dans les plans.Ce qui pourrait éventuellement, un jour être facturé, c'est le service (que nous ne proposons pas et n'avons pas l'intention de proposer) de retrait de bitcoins immédiat, par opposition à "sous 24h". Vous cliquez sur "Retirer des Bitcoins" dans le menu de gauche.Vous donnez un montant et une adresse, vous validez. Ce n'est pas exactement ca.Davout il prépare le paiement avec ses petits doigts, il fait les audits comptables, il fait le contrôle du paiement, il l'archive et le tamponne.Et ensuite seulement il l'envoie à une autre personne, physiquement éloignée et dont l'identité sera tenue secrète qui, elle, fait le paiement à partir d'une des adresses de cold-storage.C'est une des manières qu'on a de se prémunir contre les attaques au "5$ wrench", on a aussi d'autres procédures d'urgence incluses dans celles que je viens de décrire (et dans le détail desquelles je ne rentrerai pas) pour faire en sorte que même sous la menace physique le vol soit impossible.C'est toute l'idée de ce que je te disais quand je t'expliquais que la sécurité réelle est plus dans l'organisationnel que dans le technique, je te réexpliquerai lundi :-)Non, ce que je veux dire c'est que la fonctionnalité de retrait instantané, qui n'existe pas chez nous, sera progressivement rendue payante chez notre concurrence.Si nous implémentons un jour ce genre de fonctionnalité ce sera probablement payant.
Une décision mutuellement profitable!Vous bénéficierez de l'insolvabilité et des délais de virement légendaires de nos amis de chez MtGox et moi j'aurai moins de support à faire pour des gens qui ne lisent pas la FAQ, et viennent s'en plaindre après. Au plaisir ! ;-)Dire qu'on sait de quoi on parle dans le Bitcoin parce qu'on a des rudiments de Java et/ou de Cobol vous avouerez que quelque part c'est assez drôle :-) Il y a comme un léger malentendu.Vous avez autorisé votre transaction hier soir à 23h, c'était trop tard pour partir dans le paiement du mercredi.Vous partirez dans le paiement du jeudi qui sera fait ce soir, comme indiqué dans la FAQ, et dans mes réponses. Absolument, il faut utiliser son propre wallet pour bénéficier de toutes les possibilités de : - contrôle des délais - contrôle des adresses d'expédition (ce qui rend les remboursements plus simples) - etc.Les "hot-wallet" vont progressivement disparaître, ou être facturés à des niveaux qui reflètent ce qu'ils coûtent réellement, il y aura notamment :  - des coûts de sécurisation (ingénierie, infrastructure etc.) - des coûts de gestion (combien laisse-t-on dans le HW, qui le remplit, à quel intervalle, qui le vide quand il se remplit trop) - des coûts d'assurance (statistiquement x% des fonds seront volés annuellement, il faut bien que quelqu'un paye ca) - des coûts de commissions au réseau (qui deviennent rapidement exorbitants sur des petites transactions fréquentes, surtout si on laisse bitcoind gérer tout ca)Ma prédiction : les hot-wallets intégrés aux exchanges vont progressivement disparaître, et ceux qui resteront seront facturés chèrement pour un service rapide. C'est comme cela que nous fonctionnons, c'est indiqué très clairement dans notre FAQ.Pour des raisons de sécurité, nous n'avons pas d'intérêt à proposer des fonctionnalités de type 'wallet'.Ce que me dit ma base de données c'est  - Demande de transfert à 17:15 - Autorisation à 22:59À 22:59 le paiement du jour était déjà figé et en cours d'audit humain.Il est parti, comme d'habitude, peu de temps après : https://blockchain.info/tx/17d8da4c47513a013c0892e03b9ceb61a84278b8d5f247ce445f22e9a318ccf8Je vous invite sincèrement  à vous renseigner sur la manière dont les différents services fonctionnent avant de les utiliser, ou, au moins, avant de vous en plaindre. Je ne sais pas ce qu'il vous a dit, donc j'aurais tendance à vous dire de lui demander.Mais sinon je peux peut-être tout simplement vous aider ?Nous étions ouverts entre Avril et Septembre pour les retraits de fonds, c'est pour ça que cette histoire m'étonne un peu.Envoyez-moi un MP ou un mail sur david@bitcoin-central.net pour commencer si vous le voulez bien Je peux vous aider ? Where do you think the "company" word comes from ? :-) BonsoirDe manière générale :  - Les virements peuvent prendre du temps au départ, cela dépend de beaucoup de choses, banque d'origine (non, ce n'est pas parce que vous êtes débité que le virement est parti). Par exemple la banque postale est notoirement longue - Les virements peuvent prendre du temps à l'arrivée pour tout un tas de raisons, nous en recevons des centaines tous les jours, les erreurs et omissions arrivent - C'est notre partenaire financier qui fait les crédits, nous n'avons pas accès au compte en banque de destination - En cas de problème nous informons notre partenaire qui fait les recherches et suivons les demandes, si nous ne revenons pas vers vous c'est habituellement que nous n'avons pas d'autres informations, - Si nous ne revenons pas vers vous il est possible que vous soyez passé entre les mailles, n'hésitez-pas à vous rappeler à notre bon souvenir, tant que ce n'est pas toutes les vingt minutes on ne vous en voudra pasMaintenant les cas spécifiques.Vous avez ouvert un ticket de support ? Écrit un mail à support@bitcoin-central.net ? Vous m'avez contacté en MP ?Déjà trois options de contact, envoyez-moi un MP avec votre numéro de compte et j'irai voir.Vous surestimez votre pouvoir de nuisance. Réfléchissez un peu plus vous verrez que ça n'aurait aucun intérêt de fonctionner comme ça.Oui, on traite les problèmes, vous n'êtes pas le seul. Ceci dit si vous posez poliment une question on vous répondra.Dans le cas contraire quand nous pensons que le problème a été résolu nous passons à autre chose.Nous sommes la depuis 2010, vous êtes la depuis une semaine. Faites vos expériences et revenez dans quelques mois.Vous n'êtes pas chez mémé. Posez une vraie question, formulez une vraie accusation ou tenez vous correctement. MerciBullshit, nous faisions les virements sortants et transferts BTC sortants même pour les comptes non vérifiés jusqu'à mi-septembre, date de notre réouverture.Si maintenant vous êtes coincé avec un compte non vérifiable il faudra attendre notre interface dédiée, mais vous pouviez demander une sortie bien avant. Bon, les kikoolols et accusations diverses ont été splittés dans un topic séparé : Bitcoin-Central, discussion, accusations, les réponses sur ces sujets se feront la bas. Comment ca que les gens partent en courant ? Il y a déjà du levier dans une option, par définition. Haha, les Chinois du FBI ?Voous *pouvez* shorter, pas sur BC, mais sur des sites comme CoinBR vous pouvez acheter des PUTs par exemple. Hehe, j'avais pas vu non plus!J'ai posté un truc dans le board staff, ça a pourri pendant deux semaines mais ca a fini par être pris en compte Moi je veux bien bouger les posts mais il faut me les signaler :-) Welcome to the tautology club. Oui c'est ça, les commissions sont prélevées au fur et à mesure de l'exécution, au prorata du montant effectivement échangé. (et non, ce n'est pas une question bête ) En me donnant votre numéro de compte en PM :-) C'est exact! Trois points pour Gryffondor :-) Un numéro de compte en PM ? :-) Je pense qu'ils ont été fermés parce qu'ils ont été considérés comme des doublons.Bon, je vous ai fermé le troisième mais rouvert un quatrième en vous expliquant le problème et en vous donnant la marche à suivre pour le résoudre.TL;DR Il manque la pièce d'identité de votre hébergeur.
I have a few, all work, just wasn't sure if my e-mail was publicly visible. Dear Bruno, please forward all the information to me by e-mail.I have no interest in entertaining your false dichotomies. See, my whole point is that it would not help at all, whatever is meant by "help".I publish some numbers that magically add up to whatever, what's the value of that? How does it "help", if by "help" you mean increasing my trust score with a select subset of bitcointalk forumites? The only thing it'll achieve fooling some idiots into the illusion of transparency.That's like people sending GPG-signed e-mails being like "see! you can check the signature on this message, I've attached the public key". The claim ID is character string labeled "Claim #" on the claims page. Non je pointais du doigt le fait qu'en l'occurrence la citation que tu fais de l'article n'était pas de la désinformation, dans la mesure ou effectivement, aucune autorité ne garantit le Bitcoin. Évidemment que pour le reste il y a pas mal de FUD et de confusion, pas la peine d'enfoncer des portes ouvertes.Pour ce qui est de préciser que les acteurs qui font place de marché sont autorisés sous réserve d'avoir un agrément d'EP je trouve ça vachement positif. En fait, la BdF ne pouvait pas raisonnablement dire "allez c'est la fête, on dispense tous les exchanges de la législation existante, because bitcoin". Donc je persiste, c'est quelque part vachement positif venant de la BdF, elle aurait très bien pu dire "allez c'est de la merde on ferme tout ca parce que terro-pédophilie du darknet".C'est plus clair ? Oui tu as raison, en fait ce qu'il faudrait c'est orthogonal au MO, c'est qu'il te laisse spécifier ta limite ET (montant BTC à acheter OU montant EUR à dépenser) Too bad, I'm not a talker Ah oui, on a aussi une API websocket publique. J'ai un pet project de moteur de trading en ruby + eventmachine qui traîne et que je reprendrai quand on aura un volume qui justifiera de passer sur un moteur en RAM uniquement, je te le partage si tu veux. Mais effectivement c'est assez fun à écrire! (bon c'est un peu moins fun à debugger )Oui ça on sait c'est pas très pratique. Ce sera résolu quand on ajouter les market orders, pour l'instant on a fait exprès de pas les mettre en attendant d'accumuler un peu plus de liquidité.Je pense qu'on va pas tarder à les activer, quitte à mettre une estimation du taux moyen anticipé pour validation par l'utilisateur.Ouais faudrait que je m'en occupe.Yep, à vrai dire il n'y a que ca. Le site web n'est qu'un client.En fait tu peux aller la reverse-engineerer avec Firebug ou autres, ca marchera c'est sur, ce que j'ai dit c'est que les signatures d'appels pouvaient être amenées à changer à la marge avant qu'on sorte la documentation complète. On a juste deux choses à faire : documentation, authentification (OAuth2)C'est écrit API-first donc tout ce que tu peux faire avec le site tu peux le faire avec l'API de manière simple (dans le sens ou notre dev front frappe notre dev back à coups de pelle si c'est pas propre).C'est un chantier qui est ultra-prioritaire parce qu'il aura un impact direct et immédiat sur notre volume :-) C'était ça ou l'arrondi de bourrin à la Bitstamp :-) Oui, ce n'était pas comme ça avant, on avait un seul compte sur lequel des opérations comptables étaient passées au fur et à mesure.On a changé le comportement pour deux raisons : avoir un compte de trading rend le moteur beaucoup plus rapide, évite des problèmes de race condition quand un ordre s'exécute et qu'on fait un retrait au même moment, et ça permet de mieux exploiter les transactions et les fonctionnalités de locking au niveau BDD sans trop dégrader les performances.Et pour le compte EUR on a une contrainte supplémentaire qui est que le solde de ton compte de paiement(*) doit toujours être égal à ton solde dispo. BC, en d'autres termes les opérations comptables qui sont passées sur ton compte EUR sont synchronisées en temps réel avec notre partenaire financier via l'API pour que le solde BC reflète le solde de ton compte de paiement LW. Sachant que le compte de paiement LW ne gère que les montants à deux décimales on ne peut pas passer toutes les opérations relatives à une exécution d'ordre dessus. On se contente de passer une opération de verrouillage (compte normal -> compte de trading) et puis au débouclage du trade une opération de déverrouillage (compte de trading -> compte normal). C'est aussi pour ça qu'un fois ton ordre exécuté ou annulé tu as très souvent des poussières d'EUR qui restent sur ton compte de trading (elles ne peuvent pas être transférées sur ton compte normal). Ces poussières restent disponibles pour les trades suivants.(*) Le compte de paiement tenu chez notre partenaire Lemon Way This is the french section, french language is expected. Passwords suck, passphrases rock, they have a much better rememberability/entropy ratio.With a 10 words passphrase you get approximately the same entropy as your 20 characters passwords and it's much easier for a human brain to remember, we're simply wired that way.Like you said the quality of the generation process is of utmost importance. Non, facture de téléphone fixe, eau, électricité, avis fiscal récent, facture opérateur internet, opérateur câble Après en avoir bien profité, la queue a en toute logique, réduit. You forgot to translate this part, teh funny bit :-) Ca devrait n'être que temporaire, c'est pour ca qu'on laisse en l'état pour l'instant.Pour ce qui est du personnel oui, c'est arrivé, ils ont encore un peu de mal, mais ils arrivent à traiter ~250 dossiers/jour alors qu'on plafonnait à ~60/jour il y a encore deux semaines.C'est la première fois que je vois la queue des vérifications en attente réduire :-) Les factures de fournisseur d'accès à internet sont acceptées.Les avis fiscaux récents sont également acceptés. I just had a superficial look at your passphrase utility, it sounds pretty neat!My passphrase was generated with diceware + raspberrypi + bitcoin-ruby + copying everything with pen and paper.I think it's really nice to make this level of security accessible to noobs too So you want to make some money off of that big rainbow table you just generated ? :-)
I don't use the ignore list. I can ignore you without it just fine.Either way, if you submitted proper claims (which means visiting your wallet URL and providing a payout address during the claims period), you have exactly one option: e-mail me their IDs, with the corresponding wallet URLs. Le délai moyen est d'environ une à deux semaines ces jours-ci. Envoyez-moi votre numéro de compte en MP j'irai jeter un oeil. Vous l'avez fait quand ? Ce n'est pas couvert par leur banque, c'est un des inconvénients du modèle P2P par opposition au modèle de tiers de confiance adopté par Bitcoin-Central.Sauf si le compte bancaire expéditeur est chez Fidor j'imagine.Si la discussion continue sur bitcoin.de ca vaut le coup de faire un thread séparé. Yes, c'est une protection pour les vendeurs contre le SEPA recall.En même temps c'est assez facilement contourné si tu commences par un petit transfert qui ne se voit pas sur le relevé avant de vraiment commencer à exploiter un compte phishé.Après je ne suis pas client de bitcoin.de, si ça se trouve ils ont des mesures complémentaires. Pas de blocage, les transferts ne sont cependant pas immédiats et sont effectués sous 24h en semaine. Let's dig this one a little further, what's the principle at hand exactly?That you should get a free, unlimited and unexpiring deposit insurance?Such a thing does not exist. Even so we committed to guarantee payment of all valid claims up to 50 BTC regardless of the amount left after the theft. A couple of days ago I took time to send you a detailed explanation of the why and how of the claims process, did you get a chance to read it?Please, feel free to tell me how you would have handled things had you been at my place. Ben, en quoi est-ce de la désinformation ?C'est la vérité, aucune autorité ne garantit les dépôts en BTC.Et pour me faire un peu l'avocat du diable, la BdF mentionne quand même que les services d'échange sont autorisés sous réserve qu'ils soient agréés en tant qu'établissement de paiement, ce qui est, quand on y réfléchit, logique et plutôt positif. Surtout pour un service comme Bitcoin-Central ! Tout le plaisir est pour moi :-) Well, Jav kept IW safe for a year (2011-2012), which is pretty much what we did too (2012-2013).It might also be worth noting that the first thing I did when I discovered the theft was to fly him from Germany to France at my expense so he could provide his insights and help us deal with this in the best possible way.It'll come back, I'm not going anywhere :-)Like I said, if you show me that there exists a way for me to produce a complete financial report that can be independently cross-checked I'll be all over it.But apparently you have no problem entertaining this circular logic of yours.Well, I don't have a crystal ball, I can't magically guess the e-mails associated to wallets.For the last time, had there been an e-mail address on file everything would have been different, we would have simply given everyone a proportional haircut and contacted everyone for an exit Bitcoin address. Je n'ai ni le temps, (ni franchement l'envie) de faire ou refaire ton éducation sur la manière dont fonctionne un ordinateur à bas niveau, on est en 2013 l'information est largement disponible. Les termes de recherche qui t'intéressent sont entre autres : BIOS, UEFI, interruption matérielle.https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/personal-incredulityTu peux toujours essayer, mais tu vas vite te faire remettre à ta place :-) Quelques petites confusions apparemment.Le BIOS est une couche d'abstraction entre le soft et le hard, il peut être bypassé par l'OS, mais sert à beaucoup plus de choses qu'au boot, et présente par conséquent une surface d'attaque exploitable après le boot (je sais pas ou tu as lu qu'il fallait booter dessus) [1]Écouter le signal "plus loin dans la chaîne de l'information", tu dois regarder un peu trop la téléLe signal qui fuit par le réseau électrique il est noyé dans tous les parasites, ceux qui existent naturellement et ceux qui sont émis par les autres machines sur la même ligne. Bon courage pour extraire le signal du bruit. La recopie d'écran à distance ca fonctionne parce que tu peux localiser en 3D la source des émissions EM et que la puissance des signaux n'a absolument rien à voirAvoir une partition cachée c'est rigolo mais ça reste du bricolage et ca ne résiste pas à la clef à molette. Ce qui résiste à la clef à molette c'est une procédure claire avec un split des signatures.Voila, ma conclusion c'est que tes Bitcoin personnels sont probablement en (relative) sécurité.En revanche pour ce qui est du service que tu proposes c'est très mignon, mais c'est fondamentalement foireux à pas mal de niveaux.[1] http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/meet-badbios-the-mysterious-mac-and-pc-malware-that-jumps-airgaps/ Non, c'est toujours pas le cas ?Il faut combiner tout ca en un seul PDF de votre côté avant de l'uploader. Entre linux et la clef, il y a le BIOS, les failles du BIOS sont donc exploitables.Le BIOS fait interface si tu préfères.Comme dit, c'est sur Ars. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ars+technica+airgap :-)Euh non, si quelque chose est crypté c'est crypté sur le disque, c'est dans la RAM que c'est temporairement en clair.Pas besoin de normes et tampons, une cage de faraday c'est faisable par n'importe quel lycéen en 1ère S.Les professionnels préfèrent la cryptographie, l'audit et des procédures organisationnelles claires au bricolage ;-) Ca devrait passer. Le JDD doit bien évidemment être à votre nom :-)Ca dépend essentiellement du délai de validation, les autres étapes se font en quelques minutes chacune. HelloI'm afraid it's too late to file a claim, the claims submission was possible for three months with a deadline in July.There was a detailed explanation of the whys and hows of the claims process (and more specifically why there had to be a deadline) posted in this thread, it might be a little hard to find buried in the 40 pages of this thread.Kind regardsDavid I can't wait for your free exchange that deals in every possible currency.Also thread locked to prevent random morons to necro it for random reasons. I am interested in pursuing legal action against this pankkake individual.His vicious trolling caused considerable harm to my business.
Il est impossible de créer une transaction sur un poste offline sans connaissance des "unspent txout", le solde seul ne suffit pas.Pour ce qui est de transmettre un virus via clef USB l'assertion "c'est secure car Linux n'exécute rien" n'est pas tout à fait correcte, il est tout à fait possible que la clef exploite le niveau d'en dessous (le BIOS) via un buffer overflow, une backdoor ou autre joyeuseté et remonte à partir de la, ça c'est vu.Des virus qui sautent les airgaps via d'autres techniques sont possibles théoriquement et exploités en pratique (voir Stuxnet par exemple), un autre exemple assez édifiant est la transmission de données, via des ultrasons émis par les hauts parleurs internes, et captés par les micros de postes connectés au réseau. Le coup des ultrasons c'est pas du délire paranoïaque, il y a un article dans Ars qui vient de sortir la dessus qui parle d'un PoC, et qui référence un autre article ou un chercheur en sécurité l'observe en live! Le débit est faible, mais largement suffisant pour sortir les 256 bits d'une clef privée ECDSA.Ce qui semble tiré par les cheveux aujourd'hui deviendra demain de plus en plus courant avec une valeur en constante augmentation, autant monter le niveau de paranoïa dès aujourd'hui. Donnez moi votre numéro de compte et on va revérifier :p Diceware is the best way to create high-entropy passphrases, mine is ~128 bits for ten words, remembered it in 10 seconds, a 256 bits entropy passphrase shouldn't be much harder to remember. Any kind of shell company will be just fine. The fact that my cert sits AES encrypted on my production servers, in clear in its RAM and nowhere else.In the security/convenience trade-off I'd rather get DDoS'd from time to time than to get MITM'd permanently.EDIT : Assuming of course that the service doesn't work simply by looking at the encrypted traffic flow, in which case you can obviously disregard the previous comment :-) Chill out, I'm not interested in drama.I was referring to the *other* threats. I'm not going to waste my time on the nonsensical ones like you just did.The CA system is bullshit, banks manage to somewhat handle it with chargebacks and wire recalls, Bitcoin deserves much better, and sometimes "much better" means "nothing at all".This merchant stuff solves an imaginary problem in a broken way, what's next in the core tree? Discount codes? Loyalty programs? It's kind funny you'd say such a thing, in this very thread.All these threats exist and the vulnerabilities will be exploited eventually, better do something about it.For my part I'll look for a flag in the Makefile to disable the whole invoicing crap, if there's none I'll patch it back to oblivion.If it happened the way theymos described it's a waste of time, except maybe for getting the cert revoked.If the DNS was changed it won't be a fraudulent request from their PoV. Hah, guess I re-quoted my misquote and dropped this bit :-) Yet it's being built right into bitcoin-qt... :-( I just did, you're partly right, I'm partly right too.I think this is where you're wrong, I'd assume (the reference doesn't say) that the CA wouldn't sign the certificate without at least the DNS of the domain pointing to CF. They wouldn't simply sign *any* certificate.Could have been achieved with any CA that validates ownership of domains with the insertion of some validation token at an arbitrary URL on said domain. Bullshit. So, what's the story here ?Also :No you're not, you want to check your account for changes, payout addresses especially and any other sensitive information that might have been altered without your knowledge. Both options are a massive MITM vulnerability. This is factually incorrect.Using cloudflare for anything bitcoin-related is a fucking heresy.As a matter of fact there is exactly one venue that could use it safely and it's MPEx. Don't worry it's safe, they just reinvented SSSS. dem lulz http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html C'est pas impossible.Je pense que c'est de la prévention de la fraude, mais bon je peux me tromper hein.Sachant qu'à ma connaissance ils ne sont pas EP ils n'ont pas de diligences prudentielles du type KYC à faire.Si tu as phishé un gros compte bancaire et que tu veux couper la piste en passant par la case Bitcoin le vendeur prend un gros risque d'annulation de virement (10 jours pour annuler un virement SEPA).Y a des gens qui se sont fait avoir sur localbitcoins aussi.Du coup oui :-) nonÇa par contre c'est faux. Le bitcoin n'a pas de statut particulier en Allemagne, c'est une déclaration de leur ministre des finances qui s'est, par la magie du hype, transformée en "l'Allemagne reconnaît le Bitcoin".La vraie raison pour laquelle ils font ca c'est pour éviter la fraude au virement SEPA (aka le SEPA recall).Parce que théoriquement ils n'ont aucune obligation de connaissance du client, ils ne touchent à aucun moment au flux en Euros.C'est bien vrai :-) A quelle heure ?
Your avatar suits you well. Mais non, sinon je vous aurais demandé si votre câble était bien branché. Vous avez confirmé la transaction (mail d'autorisation) ? https://blockchain.info/tx/7c624079e13f12c33a6fda84538c53b74210ff10dc4813b82d4ef8419d5f1981 Non non c'est peut-être juste qu'ils se plantent et que vous avez raison.Envoyez-moi un PM avec votre numéro de compte et je regarderai.28 octobre normalement c'est bon, un PDF téléchargé ca aurait du passer aussi. Non Ptet qu'on a un client bitcoin à mettre à jour dis donc dis donc On a pas de notion de "exactement".Ca se fait en entre 18h et minuit en général.On va peut-être twitter cutoff une heure à l'avance, ca vous serait utile? Oui L'algorithme de Google Auth est public, vous pouvez faire un script en Ruby qui vous sort les OTP, c'est tout à fait possible. On va mettre à jour la FAQ et ajouter une mention sur la page de dépôt.Vous avez un numéro de compte ou de ticket que je puisse aller voir ?De manière générale pour le traitement des vérifications ca doit notablement s'accélerer très prochainement à l'arrivée de trois nouvelles ressources dédiées. Dans ce genre de cas envoyez un mail au support (support@bitcoin-central.net) en re-confirmant les informations liées au compte (nom, prénom, date de naissance, téléphone, adresse) et on vous enlève authenticator manuellement.Si le compte présente un solde significatif on demandera le renvoi de documents d'identification. Moi non, mais vous le pouvez si vous le souhaitez. L'intérêt de la limite c'est qu'il y a un délai de 24h entre l'augmentation de la limite et la prise en compte effective. Tout ça dûment notifié par mail.Oui. Ca ne vous aidera pas si vous vous êtes fait phisher votre compte bancaire, un des autres intérêts de la limite de retrait.En fait on est même allés bien plus loin que ca puisqu'on a presque tout refait, la technique, et les procédures opérationnelles.1. Parce que ca n'a pas un très grand intérêt d'une part et que ce serait complètement ingérable techniquement d'autre part.2. On a système d'approbation par serveur tiers déjà en place. J'y reviendrai plus en détail plus tard. En l'état, pour vider votre compte il faut à un voleur votre mot de passe + 2FA + accès à votre e-mail, OU compromettre nos serveurs d'application et ceux d'autorisation.3. Dès qu'on peut dégager un peu de temps pour le mettre en placeLes virements entrants ne sont acceptés qu'à partir du compte bancaire déclaré à l'inscription. As a matter of fact France has signed a cooperation treaty with the USG, three days ago, (not that this is in any way relevant or interesting).We have some US-based customers that signed-up when our previous financial partner told us it was ok.Our current financial partner doesn't want anything to have to do with US residents (US citizens residing in Europe are considered kosher though).Bottom line, I don't care about FATCA, I let my financial partner care about it. And they seem to care.What happens shortly is the following : - we collect payment addresses for all the accounts that we have to liquidate ( - we pay their outstanding balances (converted USD + BTC) to their Bitcoin address - we wish them good luck in their future endeavoursThere's some work on our end to make it happen, please bear with us while we come up with some dedicated interface. Around 1300 people.Around a hundred are processed every weekday but we should soon be able to have three times more handled every day. Your reasoning flaw is here, the site can not, and should not have to guess whether the request is legitimate or if a scammer is trying to get a refund on an attempted cheat.It makes perfect sense from a business perspective to take a very clear position should this kind of stuff arise. Seriously, how would you handle the case "someone sends an unconfirmed TX right before the bet ends, TX confirms after the bet has been decided" ?Refund?You want to discourage scammers, not have to guess every time whether the request is legitimate or not. Thank you. I am amused. Your opinions are your problem, not mine.Instawallet was never designed to operate like a bank.We provided a free way to store spare change, not accounts. Compare it to a free deposit box if you want but not to a bank.This was answered to in my previous post, did you miss it?It's "is arbitrary", either way yes it is arbitrary. I looked a bit around teh interwebz at the time but found no definitive reference on "How to design a proper claims process in 7 days".You were welcome to make constructive suggestions at the time the claims process was designed, instead you chose to throw shit at us and post your wallet URL publicly, boo.You misunderstand, it wasn't an incentive for him to come forward, it was a protection against him stealing even more money by claiming wallets based on his inside knowledge. "Would you download a car?"
Ne le prenez pas personnellement, à minuit les heures commencent à être longues à travailler après une journée de bureau :-)Je vous ai répondu.Je sais que le phénomène du vol d'identité est assez répandu aux US, en partie à cause de leur numéro de sécurité sociale lié à leur credit rating si je ne m'abuse, mais je ne savais honnêtement pas que ca commençait à se développer en France. En y réfléchissant j'ai un peu de mal à voir ce que je pourrais faire avec quelques scans, sans me présenter en personne pour ouvrir un compte et/ou demander un crédit. Je suis sincèrement interessé par des exemples de mode opératoire, et non, ce n'est pas pour les mettre en pratique ;-) I think this has been answered before, but it doesn't really matter, the answers are probably buried in this thread among giszmo's butthurt and tvbcof's irrelevance.We've been hacked and got proof that the hacker got access to our database in read/write. (and no IW didn't leak wallet URLs, if anyone is interested I can link the proper humiliation I gave Roger Wehbe who was trying to peddle this nonsense for weeks, meanwhile begging for tips, anyway, I digress).So our hacker got access to our database, meaning access to all wallet URLs (and all the information you have provided for that matter). So if you follow that meant we *had* to define a specific claims timeframe.Had we allowed the claims to run forever the following would have happened : - legitimate users claim their funds - six months later, when no one cares anymore the hacker comes and picks up what's not been claimedWith a deadline we were forcing the hacker to reveal himself if he tried to claim wallets, we figured most decent wallets would be claimed by their users and that a double claim would immediately raise suspicions (especially if they were coming from the same/a weird IP or if we fingerprinted the same browser on 100 large duplicate claims).So that was the first reason.The second reason to have the 90 days time frame is quite simple too, as you know, Bitcoin wallets after being hacked are quite often insolvent. So the reason for the fixed time-frame is that it allowed everyone to file a claim without rushing in a bank-run like scenario where the first claimants would get paid 100% and the rest would get whatever was left. By having a fixed time-frame we managed to accurately determine whom to pay and how much at the end of said period.Since we had to set the payouts in stone before actually paying it also meant we'd have to start paying everyone at the same moment, so when we had to determine the time-frame length 3 months seemed the appropriate number in order for people to get access to their money in a reasonable time-frame while at the same time leaving a reasonable delay for people to place a claim.Does this answer your question ? If you have submitted your claim through the interface you should have gotten a claim ID, please send it to me in a PM.Submitting your claim through the interface means that: during the 90 days claims time-frame you visited https://www.instawallet.org/w/YOU_WALLET_KEY and gave us a bitcoin address for the payout along with an e-mail address.If you have simply e-mailed one of us to claim you got answered to use the interface in the way I just described.So basically : - If you have a valid claim visit your wallet URL again and confirm the claim to give us discharge - If you didn't submit a proper claim I'm afraid there isn't much I can do.There is no set limit for approval of claims that were properly submitted during the initial 90 days period but weren't approved. With the claims interface ? Look, there is a very precise reason a proper claims process with a proper claims interface was set up.There is also a very precise reason why the claims period had to be limited to a fixed time-frame.There is also a very precise reason why claims were only processed when people were able to provide the correct URL to their wallet(s).And finally there is a very precise reason why the claims were processed through this interface and not by e-mail or by teleported napkin bits with half a URL written on them.I think you fail to understand at least one of these reasons, tell me which one and I'll explain. I talked with you by PM a month ago. You have been answered. If you have a claim to approve you need to visit https://www.instawallet.org/w/YOUR_WALLET_KEYIt won't work if you did not submit a claim during the 3 months time-frame that was advertised many times, here and on the instawallet website itself.The Eiffel tower is pretty neat.Other than that you'll have to request an appointement.If you want to buy tasteful clothing in bulk then yes. Go make a religion or something Read the fucking thread, the guy did not use Bitcoin-qt. Oh wow, half the posts disappeared in this thread, did TKeenan somehow manage to sober up?So, how're you you today tvbcof?I sense a lot of ungiven fucks in your aura, so I figured I'd keep you company a bit :-) I registered on these forums in 2010, before 98% of the users around here.So... if I follow your "reasoning" you can associate me with whatever scam took place since then, right?Apples, oranges.If BB used your unconfirmed TX output in the bet payout it'd be retarded because one scammer could fuck with the validity of the complete payout (a in "for everyone", not only for his winnings).So the correct course of action for you is : - Think, - Understand the why of the policy, - Get over it, - Pay more attention next time Si vous avez compris cette phrase, ne prenez pas la route.Ok, et si vous commenciez par m'envoyer votre numéro de compte en PM ?Vous avez lu les conditions d'utilisation ?Regardez sur le site de votre banque et dites-moi si vous en voyez un :-) Oh fuck, I lol'd. Non.Même s'il y en avait 5000, quel serait le problème?Dans la nouvelle interface ce sera groupé sous un item "Vous avez acheté X BTC au prix moyen de Y", et vous pourrez déplier pour voir le détail exact.Ce sera beaucoup plus clair, parce que vous ne verrez plus "ce que le système à fait", vous verrez "ce que vous avez demandé". Notre interface n'est pas très claire pour l'instant, c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire.On a une nouvelle interface qui arrive d'ici deux ou trois jours et qui présentera les choses de manière beaucoup plus claire.Pour les explications, vous avez deux comptes dans chaque devise un normal, et un dit "de trading".Quand vous placez un ordre, les fonds nécessaire à l'exécution de l'ordre sont "verrouillés", ils sont passés de votre compte normal à votre compte de trading, ensuite, au fur et à mesure de l'exécution de votre ordre (qui peut s'exécuter contre un nombre illimité d'ordres opposés) ce qui est sur un de vos comptes de trading diminue et ce qui est sur l'autre augmente, une fois l'ordre complété, ou partiellement complété puis annulé, ou pas complété du tout et annulé, tout repasse sur vos comptes normaux. SAUF les poussières d'EUR qui, elles, restent sur votre compte de trading, la raison étant que ces poussières ne peuvent pas être reportées sur votre compte chez notre partenaire financier qui gère les montants sur deux décimales uniquement.Votre ordre peut s'exécuter contre un nombre illimité d'ordres opposés parce que si vous achetez 1 BTC vous pouvez très bien acheter 0.1 à Riri, 0.2 à Fifi, et 0.7 à Jean-Claude.Les commissions sont prélevées au fur et à mesure, sur 8 décimales, une commission par ordre opposé, au prorata du montant échangé.En clair et en résumé : on ne fait pas ça exprès pour vous donner mal au crâne, mais pour pouvoir compter au plus juste tout en nous intégrant avec un partenaire financier qui ne connaît pas les poussières d'euro :-)On va très bientôt avoir une présentation beaucoup, beaucoup plus claire. On a l'infrastructure pour, on est pas contre, ceci dit la priorité numéro un en ce moment c'est la validation des comptes Don't forget to pick up your "haters & whiners club" membership card on the way out. I've rarely seen so much butthurt in such a small mind. Envoyez-moi votre n° de compte par PM je regarderai ce soir si je peux faire quelque chose. Vraiment c'est variable, l'objectif est de faire un envoi par jour en fin de journée, entre 20h-minuit.Ca peut-être un peu plus tôt comme ca peut être un peu plus tard, voire le lendemain si notre audit comptable lève une alerte et qu'il faut aller enquêter.
Can someone point me to the page of this thread where the "Random people holding funds" VS "A multisig address" was debated ? Vous savez je n'ai rien fait de particulier pour qu'elle confirme depuis le moment ou je vous ai répondu :-)Uniquement ce que vous envoyez.Le client Bitcoin vous la conseille, je n'ai plus les recommandations en tête, ça dépend essentiellement de la taille de la transaction (pas du montant). Au plaisirSi vous passez par un intermédiaire non-agréé limitez vos risques et ne laissez juste pas vos EUR traîner  De toute façon LW ne prend pas les permis de conduire français :-S Oui ca va bloquer.Voir PM.Oui, envoyez moi votre n° BC en PM.Apparemment la transaction n'est toujours pas confirmée.Vous n'avez rien à faire, c'est au réseau Bitcoin de le faire.Nous avons inclus une commission dans la transaction, ca devrait donc finir par confirmer. Your troll : 2/10 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t_c45byLLQ Non, c'est fait manuellement, entre 18h et minuit.C'est variable parce que tant que notre audit comptable n'est pas bouclé on n'envoie rien.Le batch d'aujourd'hui part dans moins de 30 minutes.Ah oui mais ca c'est pas possible :-)Si vous nous envoyez des fonds il faut qu'ils aillent sur un compte de paiement à votre nom, et la vérification est un préalable à l'ouverture de compte du côté de notre partenaire financier. Si seulement... Ce n'est pas nous qui faisons les vérifications, si c'était le cas il y aurait exactement zéro personnes en file d'attente :-)Vous le faites déjà en virement SEPA en ajoutant votre nom de compte (BC-U...), non ?Pour ce qui est de la CB on y réfléchit, mais ça demande une intégration technique super propre pour éviter les chargebacks en faisant du 100% 3DS. Parce qu'il y a du monde (+ de 800 personnes en attente) et qu'il n'y a pour l'instant qu'une seule personne à plein temps sur notre KYC du côté de notre partenaire financier.Deux personnes supplémentaires à plein temps arrivent dans le courant de la semaine, ca devrait graisser un peu les rouages. Vous avez bien envoyé le virement depuis le compte dont vous avez donné le RIB ? Bitcoin-Central has a partnership with a PSP, Paymium, the company running it (and where I work) isn't a PSP itself though. The money is kept by the PSP (not on Paymium's corporate accounts), BC just moves it around when trades happen.The funds are safer in the way that Paymium going belly up would have no impact on the customer's funds, the accounts opened by the PSP are in the customer's name, which means that if there ever is an issue the customer has someone to turn to. The risk of having bank accounts frozen (and customer funds with them) is also non-existent compared to exchanges who use their own corporate accounts to store customer funds. Normalement horaires de bureau un peu étendus.Le problème des dépôts est un peu récurrent en ce moment, je travaille dessus en ce moment même, il y a plusieurs transactions qui restent en état "non confirmé" ce qui est probablement ton cas, et ce qui est, nous sommes bien d'accord, gênant pour nos clients. Oui, et c'est légitime.Oui, une API est prévue, elle existe déjà (c'est ce dont se sert l'application web pour parler au backend)On a prévu de la documenter ASAP, en attendant il n'y a aucun problème si vous écrivez votre client en regardant comment le front-end parle au backend. Oui, si vous êtes majeur et hébergé vous pouvez en mettant sur le même scan de justificatif de domicile PI de l'hébergeur, JDD de l'hébergeur et une attestation manuscrite attestant de l'hébergement en question. Not reallyBitcoin.de works more like a centralized version of localbitcoins, it matches a buyer with a seller, they settle the transaction among themselves with a bank wire, and when the seller receives the wire he releases the coins from escrow.Bitcoin-Central acts as escrow for EUR and BTC, not only BTC.Both approaches have their advantages and inconvenients. Oh look, my two favorite haters, I won't have much time for you today, if this persists I'll make sure to hire someone to come feed you some drama and harvest the lulz from time to time.@NickNick : Stuff that breaks usually doesn't warn in advance :-) On a saturday?

Je pense que tu t'abuses, même le virement SEPA peut-être annulé dix jours après avoir été émis. https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/personal-incredulity S3052 est un vieux de la vieille qui propose son analyse technique moyennant finances.C'est un trader très sympa basé à Zurich. Il n'y a pas de question idiote, la paranoïa est la bonne attitude.Le RIB est exigé par notre partenaire financier pour avoir un document qui justifie que les fonds proviennent et retourent vers un compte qui est à toi.C'est un peu redondant avec ce qui nous arrive en méta-données bancaires, mais bon, c'est comme ca.Un prélèvement nécessite en théorie une autorisation de prélèvement signée.Par ailleurs un prélèvement c'est la porte ouverte à la fraude massive, c'est tellement facile de faire opposition dessus.Rassurer un parano... Bonjour la galère :-)Non, rassure-toi, il y a pire, et de très loin. Tes questions sont valables et appellent une réponse complète.Il faut que tu précises quel exercice comptable que tu regardes, une startup en perte c'est pas non plus un scoop :-) Le problème de base est maintenant réglé. Yep! On a reçu Thomas Lelong chez nous pour parler avec lui.Il nous a envoyé un mail il y a une paire de semaines en disant qu'il aimerait vraiment faire un sujet plus en profondeur sur le Bitcoin, et que c'est surtout la la direction de la rédaction qui souhaitait plus de sensationnel.Wait and see. J'ai lolé ma race. Some kind of disk flushing maybe? Disregard the morons questioning your question.If you really want to get to the bottom of this I'd try : - asking #bitcoin-dev - moving the floppy unit to another computer try to confirm the behaviour - trying from the same computer on a different OSAre you positive you have no viruses on your box?Maybe it could be some sort of malware looking for a *coin-qt process and scanning all disks for wallet files.Do you keep balances on the clients ?Do you get the same behaviour with your CD drive if any ? Floppy drives, stopped being cool in 1998, started being cool again in 2013.I totally want to transfer data to my airgapped boxes using floppies, easy to hear when accessed, easy to fill with random junk so no malicious data crosses the gap, trivial to destroy: kill it with fire.5 internets to you OP.For your question, no idea, that seems really weird. Getting other people to confirm this behaviour might be slightly tricky :-) Voila voila.C'est fait! Merci pour la suggestion! Yup, I'm loving it. But do you see the morbidly obese crowd you're used to in said lines? Nah. Why would that be?Sometimes I get cold fries, I go to the counter, I say "could you change my fries, they're cold", which I usually follow by "please" and conclude by a "thank you" upon reception of additionnal fries in the acceptable temperature range. Oh, and every fucking time I forget to ask for extra salt, so I have to go back, stupid me.Look at the mtgox withdrawal delay thread, these people have reasons to be angry!But you... Seriously, you're waiting in line like everyone else for a few days more than advertised and you get all agitated and all "approve my account or else"?(And for the record, despite your account being locked on our side your verification process went on with our partner and you have a verified account with them since a week or so)Haha, that Napoleon complex thing again? Do you know that saying? "The flaws we see in others..."No fucking way. I don't disclose identifying information about past, current, or to-be customers, and certainly not to make some random point on some random internet message board.That's what it'll be to you unless you get invited back in :-)Look, you're new here, no problem with that, for now you just need to know that tvbcof has some sort of weird obsession with me. Go figure.Right. Now I'm going to thank you for your visit and genuinely wish you luck and happiness, you know where to find me. The fight club has two rules, Instawallet had only one : "He who has knowledge of the secret URL is the legitimate owner of the funds".Wait a second, you made your wallet URL public before the fucking claims process was even started, and then you come bitch about us not paying you?You jump to conclusions right after we get compromised, throw shit at us before we're even done piecing the claims process together, act like an idiot by voluntarily publishing your wallet URL on bitcointalk and then you come complain that handling your claim isn't as straightforward as the others?Look in a mirror and get real, you shat on your own feet.The correct and logical course of action now becomes crystal clear, we'll pay both claims half of the outstanding wallet balance.Do you have further questions ? J'ai passé ton message :-)https://twitter.com/Bitcoin_Central/status/400991927689940993 Do her.Sort the rest out when you get coverage. It'd get picked up instantly on the dev IRC and handled promptly, refer to what happened in march.And even if it didn't, the price wouldn't drop in five minutes by some random number you just pulled out of your ass. People actually reading the notification, seeing past the bullshit would see an opportunity to buy the coins dropped by the clueless panic-sellers.Lurk more, think harder. Side note for those who want to create more elaborate schemes with improved theft/loss/collusion protection : use Shamir's shared secret sharing, available as the unix utility ssss. Désolé, on a encore des petits problèmes avec nos notifications de transactions, on y travaille pour éviter ce genre de désagréments.Normalement les transactions doivent-être créditées après 2 confirmations, si à 3 vous n'avez toujours rien il y a quelque chose à régler de notre côté.De manière générale, pour ce qui est des adresses de réception elles sont valables une semaine à partir du moment ou elles ont été générées. Pour plusieurs raisons : - On ne veut monitorer qu'un nombre limité d'adresses, impossible de scaler correctement sinon - Si nos clefs privées sont compromises il n'est pas souhaitable que les utilisateurs continuent d'envoyer des fonds sur les adresses associées (au passage je tiens à préciser qu'il n'y a aucune clef privée sur aucun de nos serveurs)Une fois qu'une adresse est invalidée elle cesse d'être monitorée, bien évidemment on conserve toutes les clefs pour pouvoir récupérer les fonds qui y seraient envoyés après la date d'expiration.Ceci dit, la page de génération d'adresse est vraiment très sommaire et ne donne pas toutes ces informations, vous ne pouviez pas vraiment savoir. On va améliorer ca en priorité, aujourd'hui si possible. Je m'occupe de vous. Trolling is a art that you do not seem to master. Or maybe you're actually unable to perform a basic google search, is that so?Oh god, it doesn't even require googling, most decent browsers will take you to paymium.com directly if you type "paymium" in the address bar.So my question here, is "Finally what?".You seem confused. If the difference between a private investigator and a police officer is unclear to you I suggest you go find out.Please, let me know by PM (or publicly if you so wish), if there is a way for us to compile an accurate financial reporting document that you can independently cross-check without trusting us. Describe all the information that should be included and how it could be cross-checked independently.Now let us go back on topic, which, for the record is "I was scammed because BC's verification process took more time than the advertised general time-frame", a particular case of the more general problem "my fries came cold".
An unlicensed money business, ignorant of FATCA (read: they'll get anally raped as soon as they set foot in the US), that can't properly round a fee, that is being effortlessly MITM'd by the NSA (yes cloudflare I'm looking at you), run by a couple slovenian freshmen? Hah. They have a very successful lemonade stand, good for them!This is rather cute coming from a pretend-lawyer whose website comments section advertises penis enlargement products and leaks your contracts templates all over the internet ;-)You're such a priceless little fella.And that's why no one gives a single shit about your "knowledge".Go back to the newbie jail, or the self-moderated section, you'll avoid getting yourself bitchslapped back and forth :-) It doesn't really do much anymore anyway: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2228 Truth is, there's no ideal solution that'll be safe, practical, and easy for your offspring/spouse should something happen to you.My suggestion is: add some paper to your mix. I'm interested too! See, you finally have a valid point. If you pursue your reasoning, based on the assertion you made, and with which I fully agree, the correct course of action becomes clear : don't test them, don't do shit that'll get you on their radar.If you think you're safe using PGP in PMs you're wrong, they'll own the forum, exploit your browser, exploit your machine through some zero-day and use it a side channel to pull the keys from your machine and work from there. Not saying that PGP is broken, just saying a technical protection measure is never a security silver bullet, they could entrap you, they could use black bag cryptanalysis or whatever they do to get their shit done.There's already tons of fun and interesting stuff to do legally, be safe and let others get in trouble. That has already been said had you read the thread before proceeding to give me a good laugh.Lurk more, it's not about performance.It always surprises me to see what some people will masturbate to.Ok, let me get something straight here, the words I say mean something, probably not what you think though. When I say "software project" I don't mean "things", I mean "software project" which has much more to it than "fine tuning nginx", throw 600k, some developers and half a ton of cheesy poofs into a room, what usually comes out isn't a working product someone cares about. It's usually more around the lines of a couple homemade frameworks, and fattened developers.Things have a proper name, the proper name for md5 and sha1 is "a hash function", repeat after me: "a hash function". And I may even precise it further "a broken hash function". It is used mostly by confused PHPtards who have no idea about what they are doing. So if someone asks your opinion next time, point them at bcrypt, no fucking exceptions.That seems to be the reason of your confusion, the correct way to make decision is by "thinking", thinking may or may not take your original gut feeling into account.See, we have one fine example of mental confusion here, using PGP when sending PMs about sketchy shit won't protect you from getting entrapped by the FBI if they are, as you say, lurking inside. Hey Goat! What's today's reason for being butthurt?Nobody said OP's question was invalid, he's just looking for answers in the wrong places, namely this forum.My suggestion would be to skip the forum's trust system altogether and use bitcoin-otc.com which is much simpler and straightforward and doesn't have the bizarre concept of "default trust". No, your Bitcoins would be recoverable from your private seed by independently calculating the relevant private keys.No offense but you have some homework to do Your question seems to imply that I'd have some way of knowing. I don't. I do know that money does strange things to people, so the correct course of action is to avoid the problem altogether by ensuring your very own safety.You'd want the benefits of being your own bank without having your own bank to protect? Electrum combines all the balances for all addresses it generates from the master public key up to {gap limit} unfunded addresses.If you want to get the same balance reported in blockchain you'd need to manually import all the relevant private keys there, which is by the way strongly advised against as it may leak information about the private seed.TL;DR: What you're trying to do doesn't make much sense since blockchain and electrum work in very different ways, and it might even be dangerous. Sale/purchase of forum accounts is openly permitted, hence the indirect rape.Just don't trust the forum.Stick to development, you're not ready for management.If there was a magical open source silver bullet it'd be used already. Otherwise it has to be tailor-made, see previous post.Everyone is responsible for their own safety, knowing that nobody will ever bail you out, or protect you is a much saner mindset than the "let's protect dumb people from their own stupidity and incompetence" fantasy.What? Obviously not, but at least you have a realistic assessment here. It's just that XSS doesn't work that way.That is true, dumb people will get raped, probably not by theymos though. Or at least not directly.TF looks like he's been sloppy, probably not malicious though. But that's just my opinion.I think there are far more plausible explanations the one you're suggesting.You seem to assume that transforming money into working software is easy and frictionless. It just isn't, managing an IT project is a full-time job.You shouldn't need to trust him if you use a different password for all sites you care about and if you assume no PM privacy.Bottom line, if your security depends on trusting theymos I suggest you review your security instead of looking for reasons to trust him. That's probably because you are trying to build trust the incorrect way. Good job sherlock.Bad job sherlock. YesYes That's not really what the log shows.Also do you the six degrees of separation theory? The one that says that basically you know everyone on this earth through at most six hops? Hey, sorry about that, we actually checked it and concluded that there wasn't anything to fix on our end, apologies for forgetting to answer. It seems to be a font aliasing issue on your side, I found a Vista system to test it on and couldn't reproduce the issue, wasn't reported by anyone else either. Look into your aliasing settings and tell me if it helps.If other people experience this issue they're welcome to comment.Seek some help. It's kind of bizarre that people assume this kind of thing, you could also be denied entry, get your ass kicked or whatever.Thank you, finally someone speaking some plain old common sense!Words of wisdom :-)Yup, other exchanges work in a sort of flawed way where the user deposits are considered to be corporate property, and can be seized, frozen and whatnot, for whatever reason, like it happened to mtgox in France (without much consequences), in the US (making them insolvent), and like it'll happen eventually to bitstamp.I'll assume your address and my compass are accurate, so consider it just happened.You made me chuckle :-) Pretty much. You must be new here.
Never use again an exchange that advertises "DDoS protection" The serious security problem is very well known about.They use cloudflare, which pretty much equates to a permanent MITM attack. It doesn't take muchHere and there, no comprehensive how-we-roll kind of post yet though.When it's published, some of the internally developed tools will be open-sourced too, talking is easy, actually implementing stuff is something else entirely Whether you read it correctly is irrelevant since it is factually incorrect.I have, as usual, no particular interest in your suggestions. I have a comprehensive forensic audit report sitting in one of my drawers, made by a decent IT security firm.There's no perceived interest on my side to share it with bitcointalk though.Well then, lurk some more I'd say, and comment if you have something interesting to add, instead of rehashing the same stuff over and over.Nobody cares about what you want. It is however in our plans to publish some procedures at some point, maybe some security-related code too. If your security model depends on not having one or more servers compromised it's probably flawed anyway.A correct security model depends much more on thorough continuous auditing and business operations procedures than it does on technical considerations.Designing your system to fail gracefully without financial consequences is far more important than designing it not to fail or get compromised. Drop the butthurt, start the thinking. I failed to locate the slightest clue in your message. Who said so? I don't discuss my business with random whiny forumites for the same reason I don't discuss quantum physics with my golden retriever, neither is mentally equipped to understand the very basics of the subject at hand.Which basically boils down to "the coffee didn't come with a temperature warning, I therefore burnt myself. I am angry about it and demand that someone pays attention to my whining".Don't hate your betters, learn a lesson.The lesson is : "please" works better than dumb threats when you're seeking assistance.You apparently did not learn anything here, however you did demonstrate your inability to distinguish a fast-food from a correctly operated money service business. You're not ordering fries here, you're requesting an account to be opened in your name with a licensed financial insitution performing legally required checks and correct due diligence on their new business relationships.Sit down, make yourself a cup of tea. Now think, think harder. Good! You just realized there may be a connection between this fact and your previous request, which was : "close my account".Your account has been closed, your data archived. You have been blacklisted and will be refused service from now on. Before referencing something I suggest you actually read it. Les comptes dits "courants" ouverts auprès d'établissements de crédit sont des comptes de dépôt au sens du CMF, ils sont différents des comptes de paiement ouverts dans les livres d'établissements de paiements.On aimerait beaucoup pouvoir proposer ce genre de service pour rendre l'utilisation du compte de paiement plus pratique.Par contre cela dépend de vraiment beaucoup de choses, si c'est possible on essaiera de le mettre en place.C'est une très bonne question, très franchement je n'en sais rien. Je vais essayer d'avoir une réponse. You're right, it's probably a scam. I suggest avoiding them altoghether and limit my interactions with them as much as possible. Let me take the liberty of quoting the FAQ for you: Your account has been unlocked a couple of hours ago, you should be able to sign-in fine. Could mean the growth potential is located a couple of feet below instead. Merci! Il a reçu le coup de boule qu'il méritait :-) Hey tvbcof, how is the quest for relevance coming along? Make a blog or something, maybe someone will care.And to answer your question, maybe the particular internet tough guy you mention grew a brain at some point.Well, not everyone is a paranoid nutjob.Hello!I was the one who answered you. My answer actually meant "you may address us in French". Maybe I was a little quick to assume you spoke French since you declared residing in France. We get quite a lot of French users that don't know we're actually located in France, so we answer in French to those, who're actually quite happy about it.Of course you got answered in English afterwards, maybe you didn't see the answer mixed in all the rage mail you sent us in the five minutes that followed. Nope, quoting my thoughts. In this thread : people confusing price and value.
Curious to see your French. I say he's looking for a plumber. Freedom is taken, not granted. Bitcoin is about monetary freedom, the disruption of the payments field is anecdotal.Bottom line : if there is demand it'll work. Yeah, because that worked so well with illegal drugs. Juste pour préciser : nous avons mis en place une confirmation par mail pour les transferts sortants.Cette confirmation est obligatoire pour que le transfert soit exécuté, le mail contient un code généré par un serveur tiers, les serveurs d'applicaiton peuvent vérifier le code de confirmation mais ne peuvent pas le recalculer.En clair : à moins de compromettre simultanément les serveurs d'application et le serveur d'autorisation (bonne chance) il n'est pas possible de faire des retraits frauduleux (à moins d'avoir compromis un compte client BC *et* sa boîte mail associée, d'ou l'intérêt de ne pas utiliser les mêmes mots de passe sur ces deux services).Bisous. This is correct.Currently no.However, we will make it possible. It might take some time though because in some cases people that aren't able or willing to verify have some outstanding fiat balance, and we want to give an exit option to these people too.So the process will be something like this : - We convert remaining fiat to BTC for these accounts - We build a small interface dedicated to the liquidation of the BTC balances (that, of course, doesn't require verification or identification to be provided)  No, the problem is that the importance of the "idea" in any successful business is vastly overestimated. That's not how "idea guys" work. They usually don't work at all. Maybe he's the guy that has "an idea" You seem to be new here.Consider the costs of having your money frozen at an exchange holding an imaginary license such as bitstamp, include it in your calculation, conclude.I hope for you that you reach the correct conclusion in time, unlike the people who had fiat sitting on gox when karpy got bitchslapped by the DoJ.You either have lots of imagination or a problem with the use of plural.I am not a jealous man.Refer to #1.   I chuckled a little. J'y ai presque cru. You must be new here.The correct answer was : bitcoin-otc  The man has a point +1Oh yeah, and only dumb morons threaten to bring lawyers in for 10k, nobody buys that bullshit. Going to court would probably cost you five times that amount in lawyer fees. It's not instant payments that's new, it's instant credit.Dwolla was already doing instant payments.And yes, nobody cares, and nobody should care.
Je sais pas, toi tu penses quoi du dernier Mario sur Wii U? Mieux ou moins bien que mastercoin ? faut arrêter de feeder les trolls les enfants Pourquoi ? Milles excuses, je pensais qu'on parlait de money as debt. Honte sur moi. https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominemTu attaques la vidéo avec des qualificatifs péjoratifs sans donner aucun argument qui supporte cette vision.https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/no-true-scotsmanTu connotes la "vision ultra-libérale" sans argumenter cette connotation, tu l'associes au propos de la vidéo et tu en tires une conclusion implicite erronée. Entre autres : - https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem - https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/no-true-scotsman Take your meds and PM Boussac your claim ID (as has been answered politely to polite people for the last thirty pages of this thread). There's probably a few percent of our GDP that evaporates in bureaucratic frustration every year...In full honesty I'd say wait a couple of weeks and resubmit your request.We understand we should respect the wishes of people who want out (and we will of course honor your legitimate request), but our number one priority is to help the people who want in. Dear Robert,As you've probably guessed we don't ask all this because we have some kind of weird documents fetish.We have to work with the financial regulator, and currently that is the way it has to be.You'd get asked the same documentation if you were to open a bank account in any French bank.I understand it sucks for our customers (especially the ones that have been around for a while like you), and I would feel the same in the same position.However remember that so far we're the only exchange that provides its customers with actual and legal individual payment accounts.I'm really not worried about that, Rome wasn't built in a day, got burnt, rebuilt, and proceeded to conquer a shit ton of other cities that weren't built on such a rock-solid foundation.Thank you for your feedback! Sorry, you must use a bigger font for your case to be handled. Yes. When we're done fixing the issues with verification. Does correct grammar come at an extra cost ? That's kinda cute. We'll have a look at the dates thing, regarding verifications you're right, 10 days is way too long, we're working with our partner to improve the speed and communication around the process. Ah si vous faites ça vous allez pas être déçus du voyage côté rapidité de traitement :-)Bon sinon nous travaillons sur les lenteurs de vérification (travailler avec un prestataire financier n'est pas toujours simple et nécessite un peu de temps pour roder le processus), nous comptons déployer aujourd'hui ou demain les pièces manquantes au traitement des transferts sortants. If we got a satoshi for every internet tough guy ... *sigh* You should slow down on the LSD. It isn't available yet, it's not planned for the immediate short-term but it's still on our roadmap. Please note how I refrained from responding with a Breaking Bad finale spoiler joke. Actually there is only an API, the frontend is simply a ligthweight JS client that relies on it.We need to document it for third-parties to be able to use it.Our new partner requires a proof of residence which wasn't required before. All documents that were submitted previously have been properly migrated for inclusion in the new verification process.That sounds about right, your shared secret was saved along with the rest when we migrated and a new one was generated when you reset the whole thing.
C'est en fait une disposition légale (les établissements de paiement agréés ne peuvent offrir leurs services qu'aux résidents de l'EEE, dont la Suisse ne fait partie), notre partenaire financier précédent nous avait d'ailleurs demandé de clôturer les comptes des résidents Suisses juste avant que nous interrompions notre service.Ca nous ferait vraiment plaisir de vous faire plaisir, mais sur ce coup la on ne peut rien vous promettre.Ceci dit si une équipe de Suisses souhaite ouvrir un exchange local on peut très facilement leur fournir toute notre infrastructure en marque blanche ;-) Nous ne pouvons malheureusement accepter que les résidents de l'EEE, ce qui exclut les résidents Suisses.À noter que c'est bien la notion de résidence qui est prise en compte, pas celle de nationalité. The PKI is still horribly broken, if I read the FAQ correctly (correct me if I don't) it means that currently anyone compromising a CA (as in any of them) can easily MITM and steal your money. Mircea Popescovitch has his chances as a rabbi. https://twitter.com/Bitcoin_Central/status/382585017789972480 Ca arrive, encore une heure ou deux et ca devrait être bon.Pour ce qui est du partenaire financier c'est un nouveau partenaire. In this particular context the transaction exists in the DB, it will be properly returned by a getrawtransaction even if it is not a wallet transaction, 404 is not the best return code for this particular context.404 might be appropriate if the method was named getwallettransaction, not gettransaction OR if the transaction couldn't be found in the general transactions DB. No, 404 is appropriate if the transaction isn't found, as in it does not exist in the blockchain.422 means "I understand your request, it is legal, but I can not process it for whatever reason".500 is definitely wrong though, there is no internal error happening, as in "unexpected error". HTTP 422. On est un peu en retard Mon cerveau a interprété "réouverture de BC = facepalm" en ouvrant le thread  It's this guy : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19ZUCoK_FP8All your bounty are belong to me. In the alternative case where you are a criminal, the bank will magically know and present you with a different form asking for more personal information. Makes complete sense.OP : try Singapore. Percentage fees are a thing of the past.They won't last much longer, because when you think about it, in a truly open and competitive market they make no sense at all. You're probably right. Didn't think about that. Nah, much longer than that, CC payments can be charged back for 13 months AFAIK. Since PP charges your CC it can't be shorter. Well, for now you don't know it for sure.If what you say is true it does look like it though. I assume you've notified SWC, but there's nothing said on the frontpage.IIRC it's owned by FreeMoney lol C'est une question de jours maintenant
e-cig = gay. You'd be suprised. Well, last time I checked it's the miners that were hashing, and therefore making the rules.Of course without users the whole thing is pointless, but without the miners have fun forking anything.That's exactly where you're oversimplifying, because it isn't. If you 51% attack bitcoin, chances are you're going to hurt confidence in the network and therefore the value, thereby changing your expected gain. You're forgetting an important unknown in this equation.So basically you're chasing a moving target, one for which it's also extremely hard to know whether you're even close to it.I never said it should be low. I didn't reply either, I pointed out that even though the question might have a theoretical answer it's not in our reach and therefore not very interesting to pursue any further. Of course, the more hashrate the best, there simply is no way to accurately declare the network to be "secure", or "insecure" without resorting to wild guesses and approximations that make the whole exercise pointless.That's not what I said, as a general thing I try to refrain from using "we should" or "we shouldn't" when it comes to Bitcoin.Good. So we're on the same page, forgive me but I'm not the kind to dig through histories and I didn't happen to encounter this particular string of words in your previous posts in this thread. If I count correctly there has only been one hardfork and it was merely a bugfix.You're oversimplifying by forgetting the fact that someone with such hashpower has an incentive not to mess with Bitcoin.But basically that's my point, there might be such a value (setting aside the added incentives), but it still makes no sense to talk about the network being "secure" or "insecure" since, as you said yourself, you have no idea and no way to know about the threshold.I don't know, and the "lengthy" discussions are here to prove that a consensus is far from reached.Why would 3tx/s not be enough with most transactions being off-chain transactions and the chain only used for settlements between account hubs ?I mean, if you're a miner you'd be tempted to use your voting power to not make too easy to get into a block.You can speak like you know the future as much as you want, I won't join you.What happens next isn't our call, it's the miners call.The day it's harder to get all the pool operators on #bitcoin-dev at the same time you might see that pulling a hardfork might be much harder than what you think. There is no "really needed" hashrate threshold that you can compare a subjective appreciation to. The question is flawed in itself.That's your opinion. Mine is that miners will decide what is theirs to decide. If a group of "core developers" or the "foundation" wishes to hardfork its their problem.There have been quite lengthy discussions about the existence of god too.As in "magically"? or by a hardfork? The context in which you're answering the question isn't Bitcoin anymore, it's a fork of Bitcoin. Sure :  - the switch to tx-fees-only happens - nothing extremely special happens - the market adapts, eventually - the network is responsive and secureThe end. No, what you call "security" is a subjective appreciation of the hashrate, compared to a perceived "necessary minimal hashrate" that is by no means "required". They just ignore them altogether.If you do work with them.And Karpeles didn't lie to a regulator, he lied to a bank. They have accounts in Europe : harder to reach.They're on thin ice too though. There is no "us" Neither possible nor happening. Not true.In these immemorial times mtgox was still unctional, at some point accepted paypal, and credit cards through liqpay. Ask people to be nice to each other.Jesus tried that already. Guess I probably missed the "Let's make up some laws, be creative!" thread in my few years here. I am David FRANCOIS and I approve this browser extension. My message did not refer to Germany, see the "<insert country here>" part.Also, just because a minister says something does not make it a law, merely an interpretation. Maybe the next minister will say the opposite, who knows.It is a guideline, not a law. In order to become law it has to go through the regular circuit.I would remain cautious about the whole thing, because right now it's still quite blurry, nothing has been said about the licensing requirements for example, do people who exchange BTC for EUR professionnally or semi-professionnally need a financial license ? Because if you extrapolate the opinion you easily reach the conclusion that yes, to exchange financial instruments as a business you need a license. This sword has two edges.There has been a ton of hype around this, but the taxman doesn't do hype he does law. I concur that this is a great thing though, but I'm mildly impressed by this whole thing because once you remove the hype varnish there isn't that much left in terms of cold hard law.It's a great start, but it's just a start. Dean, Washburn, Ibanez, ou à la rigueur SG, voire Les Paul (Epiphone s'abstenir) si vraiment j'en tombe amoureux. If, as a company you sell something, the taxman doesn't care whether you actually collected VAT, it's irrelevant to his mission of collecting VAT on the money that came in by the means of sales.If you do not charge VAT on a sale then it's a net loss for you, unless of course your margin is higher than the applicable VAT rate.The thing you need to understand is that there is no such thing as "unclassified", if it not explicitly classified, then it is classified in the default shitty category of you-pay-vat-on-each-sale.And no, we moved the money to France in June 2012 and got a proper financial license through a partnership in December, we'll still be operating legally from France when we reopen. If you're doing EUR in, BTC out then you're not proxying.And if you combine EUR-in, BTC-out AND BTC-in, EUR-out that's equivalent from their PoV to EUR-in, EUR-out.And if they said there is no need for regulation for you ATM thing that's extremely surprising, I suspect they didn't understand the question, because the money laundering implications of such a device are quite massive. "Oh hey, I can just come up with stashes of dirty cash money, and teleport it to Singapore". Do you have something in writing about this ? Do they actually have authority to exempt you of it ? I'd really recommend to be very very careful. Because they won't care until they start caring because they suddenly changed their minds... Are you implying that a normal tax authority could decide on its own to pass on the option of collecting more taxes ? :-)
Nope, you're wrong, you always have the option to sell them to another company, no need to remind you how VAT works, and how companies don't care about being sold stuff with or without VAT if they can afford to front it up :-)It's something that all tax authorities have in common.When we sold bitcoins through instawire.org we did. Other than that we don't sell them. But we do pay VAT on fees collected in BTC in exchange fees. It's not conjecture, until Bitcoin gets a legal status you *have* to consider it to be a generic good/service.Here's the write-up : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=78978.msg880342#msg880342 If you are a company you are a professionnal, the position you're taking is *extremely* risky. That is correct, but you're opening yet another can of worms, as "proxying money" is something that is heavily regulated and requires a financial license.I made a complete write-up in these forums a year or two ago on the state of these questions in Europe, maybe I'll find some motivation at some point to go fish it up. It'll become a real issue as soon as it starts actually mattering. If you're small time nobody cares, if you start getting big time you won't find an accountant to sign on your stuff.Until it starts to matter.If you're doing business seriously you need to consider all foreseeable risks, and that is one of them.Because just because you didn't get in trouble today doesn't mean the taxman won't come tomorrow knock on your door and bash your company to nothingness.That would be specified in the law, in France for example it's around 50kEUR/year which is not much.You do not reason with the taxman by using common sense, you use laws.FTFYThere actually is one correct and sensible way to handle this situation, it is to use the procedure that is present in France (and I assume every civilized country), to ask the tax administration for a formal and binding opinion on a very specific question. In France it's called a "rescrit fiscal" where you ask the taxman to clarify something and take a position. That's where you need to word the question extremely carefully :-) If and only if you also have a good passphrase on your key.You get the convenience too by using ssh-agent. No, do thisCode:$ openssl rand -base64 45 He just took that back, when SMF tells you in red that a reply was posted while you were typing it's for a good reason ;-)Same here. You get VAT exemptions under certain thresholds, but these conditions make building a business around selling coins infeasible in practice. But if you dig just a little deeper you'll find the situation to be even shittier, since a corporation, selling coins through an exchange would, in theory, be required to pay VAT to the state for the sales. Stocks and gold are not monetary instruments. Financial instruments maybe, monetary instruments I don't think so.If there hasn't been anything specifically said about VAT I would be extremely cautious, the tax administration might have a very different interpretation of what we both think is common sense. Where did you hear that the VAT issue was solved in Germany ?Where did you hear it was categorized in the same way as gold ?Maybe I'm wrong here but I don't think that it was part of the whole Germany-recognizes-Bitcoin-as-private-currency thing. I personally use Ubuntu LTS or Debian stable for servers I manage, and as far as I know they don't have g++ 4.7.If you're targeting sysadmins (which I think is great) it would be good to have it build easily on these versions.I really like the idea of having ligthweight tools that I can use on my servers instead of running a resource-hungry client, but if I need to fiddle around to get g++ 4.7 or run cutting edge versions that's kind of a turn off.Then again I don't know shit about C++ so I have no idea about the difficulty of working around the limitations of g++ 4.6.3 which is present on Ubuntu LTS for example. This is a very important question that smart people have been asking themselves for a couple of years now.Theoretically the VAT applies to the full face value. À titre personnel je pense que Ripple a beaucoup de potentiel comme système de paiement.C'est même un système de paiement largement supérieur à Bitcoin à bien des égards.Ceci dit, voir les XRP comme réserve de valeur, comme investissement, c'est un peu comme voir les timbres comme investissement ca me paraît un peu futile.Rien ne dit que demain il n'y aura pas d'autres sociétés qu'OpenCoin pour vendre leurs propres timbres que les processeurs du réseau Ripple seront libres d'accepter ou pas.La chose qui me gêne dans Ripple est qu'OpenCoin souhaite justement se financer comme ca.Je pense que Ripple pourra vraiment émerger le jour ou il sera entièrement open source et que des modes de fonctionnement un peu différents pourront-être envisagés. Tu l'as pris pour toi ? Merci d'arrêter la vulgarité à outrance, cela n'apporte rien et c'est franchement désagréable à lire.L'OP propose un deal que des adultes majeurs et vaccinés ont la liberté, d'accepter ou d'ignorer.La vulgarité et la grossiereté en elles-mêmes ne sont pas un problème. Un soupçon, accompagné d'un peu d'esprit c'est même très rigolo à lire. Prends exemple sur MPOE-PR, elle défonce les idiots avec juste ce qu'il faut.La, en l'espèce ça devient un peu lourd. I'll just leave this here.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IdCwtIijOA The funds have been converted and sent to ICCF. Have you lowered the g++ dependency? Probably because this person wouldn't be invited inside.

That was just me subscribing to the lulz-party. Obligatory : http://trilema.com/2013/the-stuff-all-good-conspiracy-theories-start-with/ Especially when they are :-) Mais en fait, ce que vous décrivez c'est le wiki :-) Hello Phinnaeus, you seem to have some sort of issue.It is commonly seen as a constructive thing to clearly express a problem in order to find a solution.The faggotry of suggesting statistical anomalies without backing them up with numbers, stalking me on the blockchain, and generally loitering around while giving us the evil look never achieved anything for anyone.You seem angry, do something about it.How do I put this... You've been paid, in full. Yet you keep questioning us, making half-assed theories without ever accusing us directly. You don't need to be a frenchman to see how that's extremely rude and inconsiderate. You also seem to expect us to provide you with some sort of additionnal information, I'm unsure about what makes you feel entitled to such a thing.You have every right to be paranoid, but this is not the place for it.If you are happy about the way we handled things feel free to express it here.If you're unhappy about it, or have complaints, express them here, or privately, whichever you prefer.If you have questions feel free, if you have suggestions, feel free.Now, if you have conspiracy theories either go make a proper scam accusations thread, or go make a my-conspiracy-theories one and see what happens.TL;DR : Please take your rude and off-topic bullshit elsewhere (and that one's for you too Phinnaeus). I'm on Firefox and it works just fine... Others will click on "add security exception" (and you should probably do the same).This question was already answered a few times. You may not agree, or you may not understand but the answers are here.And since I've seen this  idea fly around here a couple of times : no, it's not designed to filter-out people who have a legitimate claim but don't pay attention, people with significant balances do pay attention, and insignificant balances are, well... insignificant.Like I said, feel free to re-read the answers posted earlier. I can understand how clicking on a single button can become a nightmare in this context.But you can't really blame that on us, can you ? Umm...We're talking about clicking a button here : Good. Go have a look at your claims. Thank you! None, except that we're working on things. Lolwut? The confirmation interface is up. Just visit your wallet URL.Don't hesitate to your questions ask here, by e-mail or on IRC. Moi ce qui me rend fou c'est les fautes d'accord. Using a salt to protect a password from being looked up in rainbow tables is useless. Just because bitcoin-qt does something doesn't make it correct.Yes, thing is, that's not really how passwords are cracked nowadays.I strongly encourage you to read this and this, you'll see how it actually happens.Usually when you do something thinking "it can't hurt" it means that you don't really understand what you're doing.Yup, and that's precisely why the "should we use salts" question is completely outdated, you don't hash, use salts or whatever, you do the right thing, you use bcrypt.We actually switched to bcrypt before you even registered on bitcointalk. Nah, you don't "claim your claim".You check the corrections we might have made to your balance.An example of a case that needed a correction : if you've sent money out just before the site was taken down it didn't actually get sent but was deducted from your balance.You should be able to get a refund based on a claim for the full amount, not the amount being deducted of a transaction that never happened.So basically you check that we have made the corrections that we had to do and if you're ok with it you sign it off, there is no Ctrl+Z with Bitcoin, when money is sent it's sent. That's the reason we're going on the safe side.Yes, it was an error. As explained you'll have 3 full months to sign your claim off. But if you do it during the next couple of days you'll get paid next Friday.The sign-off interface should be put online today, is it that big of a window ?If someone reports a massive mistake on our side during the first seven days we'll have to recalculate everything, if not we're good. If someone reports such a mistake afterwards we'll have less latitude to fix it so we'd really like it if we could send a massive transaction next Friday and forget about it.Yes, the bulk was already handled.Guess what, I don't know, I don't have access to the claims DB directly. The work on the Instawallet claims is clearly split among multiple people to ensure proper oversight. If you're still using salts in 2013 you're an idiot, no exceptions.
170 Rue Raymond Losserand, 75014 ParisOther questions ? You're welcome to drop by our office and explain to us how we should securely handle the distribution of a couple million dollars worth of virtual currency to a flock of anonymous users.Any better ideas than having the users sign-off their claims themselves to ensure that everything is correct before sending out tons of money irrevocably over the internet ? Seriously, go for it, I'm listening. Certainly not.If you use cloudflare on anything remotely BTC-related you're a security dumbass. Yes, in 24h. You'll have to visit your Instawallet URL. Only in the unlikely case we did everything wrong and a lot of payouts need to be recalculated.In the extremely likely case that we did not make mistakes, or if we made small ones that can easily be fixed you will get paid next friday.To summarize the announcement : - starting tomorrow evening you'll be able to confirm your claim, - next friday, if you confirmed your claim you get paidSimple, isn't it? Thank you! It's not exactly new though, it's been operating since 2010 with the notable exception of the couple last months :-) They don't "switch" to corporate accounts. They never really had proper segregated accounts in the first place.There is exactly one bitcoin exchange that has segregated user accounts (to be perfectly fair it does not appear to be necessary in the US where an MSB license, or a partnership with a registered MSB is sufficient). Holding client funds on corporate bank accounts is already and in itself illegal.But it's not like this hasn't been repeated over and over before. Yes, it might work a little differently though. Some things are best kept as a hobby. I'll do it for 1 BTCAlso pro-tip : look at registration date http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5PvBzDlZGsThat is correct.We'll be closing the claims at 10PM CEST (that's actually a 91 days claims process to be very precise).We'll also post an announcement in a couple of hours detailing what happens next, and how exactly it happens. LELz. No discount for a bitcoin payment ?Looking at the ad, the price offered for Bitcoin payment even seems 10% higher than the regular price... People being required to demonstrate the ability of not having financial issues before voicing opinions sounds like a very good thing to me. Well, the root cause is obviously the Mac, right.The bug on bitcoind's side though, IMO, is that it forces you to go through hours and hours of reindexing redownloading when this kind of stuff happens instead of handling it more gracefully. The steps that I used to reproduce it before giving up on bitcoind on the Mac mini : - Have a good evening coding around, listening to some nice music and stuff, - go to bed - come back to computer with cup of coffee - fail to bring computer back up from idle/sleep/suspend or whatever a mac does when you leave it alone for a while - hard reboot it - rage at bitcoind casually telling me that the blockchain is corrupted and that i need to reindexConclusion : in the presence of coffee, leveldb spontaneously self-destructs. It's not a laptop it's a Mac Mini that simply goes idle from time to time, for example at night when unused.And bitcoind should probably be a little more resilient than "oh really, you let your computer go idle, let's just re-download the whole chain".If you think bitcoind should only be resilient on Debian stable in a well-connected datacenter you're going to keep seeing the general decline in nodes that is being experienced.If you reason this way why would you want to implement pruning at all? After all if bitcoind runs fine on a server with an i7, 1To disk, 32 Go RAM and a 1Gbps connection that's the most important thing right ? Exactly, so the reasonable course of action is to refrain from assumptions and wild guesses.A court examines facts in deciding of culpability, nothing else.Good, so basically smart people understood, and haters hated. Nothing very surprising here.Thank you. Most is already wrapped up, we'll communicate on the exact next steps in a couple of days.
This. Again, an assumption, by some sort of logic backflip gets transformed into factual information. Did you read the results of our independent security audit? You did not. Did you bother to string a few words together, have them translated and shoved in a mailbox? You did not. Do you make up factual information on the basis of your imagination? Looks like it!You were explicitly told about the switch, and chose to keep your funds there. That's exactly where the scope of "your business" ended in a small poof of "i don't care", apathy is not, and will never be an excuse to anything. Oh, and you still didn't say how it could be in any way relevant to the matter at hand.We did it as a courtesy, because communicating on open cases to some angry mob is not usually how it's done.I guess I didn't notice the tact among the threats, internet policemen and the "let's streetview the fuckers" being thrown around.I'm sure teh forums will get right on that.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go do some actual doing. No, what is being said is that there is no such thing as a deposit insurance that is both free and unlimited, which is quite basic common sense.I don't really see how that is: for one any of your business, and for two remotely relevant in any way.No, actually what is a hard to comprehend is how some users manage to keep insinuating stuff after being shown the police report we filed, and being told in this very thread about how they can independently associate themselves to the official investigation.Do it or don't, but don't complain you're not given the keys to independently inform yourself, we already have more than enough talkers in bitcoinland, but it's doing that makes a difference. Guess I missed the part about publicly displaying the values, and not keeping them hidden and using the hashing as a catastrophe prevention measure in case of a server compromise, or even a limited blind SQLi.How would a salt even work in that case ? If it's different per IP you'll get different hashes, which sounds useless in that use case.Overall it doesn't look like a very good idea (hashing+displaying IPs), too easy to get wrong and limited usefulness. Discussed this with you a few weeks ago.Happens to me every single time OSX ML fails to come back up from suspend.Pretty much the only reason why I stopped running a node. There's this common misunderstanding that salts should be secret. (and also the common misunderstanding that salts should be used at all).Salts protect against rainbow tables, nothing else, and they do not need to be secret to achieve this purpose, only different for each value that gets hashed. Google Auth is an implementation of a open standards called TOTP and HOTP that you can use on a regular computer (or theoretically with a watch, a pen and a paper). Hurr'durr'ing is hardly justified here.No other site than mtgox itself can support the Yubikey they send you. If you see a site claiming that they support gox's keys too you should run.The reason is that a yubikey contains an AES key that is used to generate and validate OTPs, with a regular key you can validate OTPs against the Yubico servers since the AES key is filled in by Yubico itself. At mtgox they flash the keys and replace them with AES keys they only know, making the key effectively unusable anywhere else than at gox itself. Don't be such a meanie, that's what the mods are selected for ! Were you asleep in December ? Haha, 0.1 BTCMuch smarter to keep the major flaw for yourself and exploit it once you get traffic. So the hash becomes the password, right?If the hash is intercepted can it not be used to authorize bogus requests?I mean if the server never sees the password in clear it can't check it in any way, if it checks the hash, and the hash is intercepted it can be used to forge requests.Thumbs up. Isn't the salting already built right into bcrypt though?If I was you I wouldn't underestimate the ability for an attacker to tell a decoy apart from a legitimate account given enough time, access to your traffic, access to blockchain data and access to basic taint-analysis tools of wallet fundings. But since I don't really know anything about your specifics I won't comment further.The approach we'll outline is more systematic and doesn't use tricks such as decoys, honeypots and other traps, I think you'll like it when you read about it.Feel free to answer in another thread and point me to it so we stop diverting dooglus' thread. You mean the one at the end of the SSL tunnel seeing passwords go through it in cleartextWell, at least you're not using cloudflare :-)Anyway, I got a little concerned about the whole "let's integrate inputs.io" thing, thinking about JD leaving some of the user funds there.Got reassured about it knowing dooglus had that insured with some sort of bond.Ended up removing my coins anyway because I wanted to take some time to calmly review the whole thing and decide how much I'd be able to deposit and feel comfortable losing should anything go wrong.To go back to this Linode thing, if your server gets compromised without you getting knowledge of it you can have your user passwords progressively harvested and bogus transactions authorized. When BC comes back online we'll demonstrate a setup that gracefully handles a fully compromised frontend AND (N-out-of-M) compromised backend nodes. It relies on the crypto we all know and love and mechanisms for decentralized transaction clearance and audit.Cheers! Wise way of implementing it.No rush at all. If it's 24h that's fine too. Dooglus, thank you very much for the ride, it was fun, I do think just-dice is great idea, but right now I'm out.Apparently your hot wallet doesn't have enough funds to withdraw my balance, so if you could manually send it to my firstbits I'd be very grateful !I'll very probably come back at some point, but right now I'd feel more comfortable being in exclusive control of my own funds. For one : what's special about it ?For two :Code:$ dig NS inputs.io | grep linode LOL http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6uXGSTfz_4Where is your god now ?The door, now. So, if I read this correctly you're saying you can only send outbound transfers once every month ?If you could please give me the dutch term I'll will look it up, my written dutch is quite terrible but I can read it just fine.Sure, like I said if you give me the dutch terms I'll look it up, my pleasure.Never heard of any such thing in France. On the other hand I have never heard of haring, paling, oliebollen and other dutch delicacies in France either.If such is the way it works I assume that you have to be transparent in your ToS about it, so your customers know exactly know how their money is being handled. So far your transparency level is pretty much : "don't worry, I'm from the Internet". Anyway, that's an assumption, guess I'll make a more complete opinion about your setup when provided with something I can research against third-party sources.Sure, if you reason like this you might as well do your exchange with pen and paper. Duh.Also PSPs have something that's called "insurance" which is there precisely to cover such risks, making the overall setup much much safer.Well, I actually can give you two pieces of advice to your, ahem, "security experts" :Don't use cloudflare, ever. Just because Bitstamp does it means it's a good thing.Don't hash your passwords with SHA2, ever. If I ever hear anyone say the word "salt" I'll stab him in the face (protip: it doesn't solve shit).Let's pause for a minute and use our brain jointly by starting with nr. 1 shall we ?What is an SSL certificate for ? It's to prevent MITM attacks and eavesdropping. Ok, so far so good.What does Cloudflare do ? It sits between you and the Internet, essentially being a massive MITM in itself, you even give them your SSL cert.So, why the fuck would you want any Cloudflare employee to be able to sniff the passwords of your users as they travel through their servers ?Gosh, what were you thinking ? "Bitstamp does it, must be cool!". Guess what, it's not.Now for the second thing : do not hash passwords with SHA2, MD5, SHA3 or any such function, and salting doesn't help, at all. Let us take a minute to examine why this is, and has notoriously been for a while a terrible, terrible security practice.What is SHA2 ? It is a hash function. What is it designed for ? It is designed for hashing arbitrarily large chunks of data to a fixed-size fingerprint. And it is heavily optimized to be *fast*. Yes, fast. That means that of all the hash functions, you picked one that actually *helps* the bruteforce process by being heavily performance optimized. Gosh, it's even massively parallelizable! As in "the whole Bitcoin system is based on efficiently bruteforcing the shit out of it".Once you use your brain the correct solution becomes quite obvious, it is to use something that is designed to be *slow*, and to adapt its slowness to the performance of common computers.So look up bcrypt, get your stuff straight, and come thank me after your first pwnage, because I'll have avoided a lot of password leakage.But either way, don't bother to change the SHA2 thing unless you also drop cloudflare, because if you don't, your passwords are already pretty much travelling in cleartext over the wire.So I'm interested in reading more about your setup. But I encourage you to do something about your glaring security flaws. When you're done with that maybe we can talk security, maybe. I lol'd :-) I guess you have a point.
A dead's man switch is typically something that you can automate. Not in your case ? Your IQ is already there, waiting for you. Run Forrest, run! Just make a greasemonkey script, you'd already be done if you'd started it instead of this thread  Are you guys running OSX ? I beg your pardon. March's fork. Merci.Par contre, j'aime bien savoir qui est derrière les sites sur lesquels je fais volontairement de la com. Enfin jdcjdr. It starts with "The", and ends with "Bitcoin conference". Re-read yourself :-) Remember those days when there were no alt-coins? Thank you for your answer!Since you do not seem to mind, and that being transparent about your setup is generally perceived as a positive thing let us dig a little further, shall we?Ok, so does this particular kind of bank account have a name ?Who exactly has authority to pull money from it ?I understand. In the case of a notary he has an account and maintains an accounting system that is necessary to keep track of funds ownership. Obviously you have such a system too, otherwise you could not have a functioning exchange, my question is : "who has the authoritative accounting data ? Is it you ? Is it some third-party ?"If a curator is needed to perform such a task it means that you're holding the funds directly and have full access to the bank account holding customer money. Is this correct ?I'm not really talking about assumptions, but about factual information that I learned over time while doing what I do, and which you seem to have some knowledge about. I'm doing you the professionnal courtesy of sharing some of it with you, make the best out of it. Next time I won't be the one asking the questions, next time you'll be sitting in front of a few not-so-funny people wearing not-so-creative suits.Let me pause for a minute here and re-read this. You are saying that because you use the same infrastructure you can ditch all the capital, reporting and compliance reporting requirements that a PSP has ? Maybe you could enlighten me regarding this particular point.I'll interpret that as "we have a good relationship with our account manager". Might be wrong here though. It would seem extremely weird and unusual though that they open "the same bank-account structure" as a PSP for a regular corporate client that has no particular financial license whatsoever.We actually are, we're wrapping up some details before relaunching though. If you actually come to get some experience in this field you'll very soon learn that there's where the devil isIt's a little presumptuous to assume you could run not only one, but also help with a second exchange business at the same time, don't you think ? But hey, smart people are always welcome!Absolutely, that's why I'm more than happy to challenge you on important issues. It is quite important that we have reliable exchanges. And if you don't do your legal background work probably you're up for a lot of pain down the road, not at the beginning, but when you'll start actually picking up some business. Which will make it even harder to handle.Like I said, the important thing is reliability, not gadgets for speculators. If we want half-baked corporate structures that'll fall at the first nod we already have Mark Karpeles for that. I strongly encourage you to document yourself about his problems with French banks in court, because right now, I kinda feel you're walking right in his footsteps.Looking forward to your answers ! No, to be precise it is not the case. Yes you can, happened back in march  Let me just re-state my question if you do not mind. (You don't mind, do you?) Good luck then! Merci! So you're an idiot.That wants to play internet detective too.How original. Actually, nothing was changed, announcing July 1st was simply a mistake on our side.To be honest, I would have rather it be today than July 11th, want to get it over with so we can all get back to more interesting stuff, among which rebuilding Instawallet. Word. Well, have a seat.
He has some points! PI c'est Pierre Noizat, aka Boussac sur le forum qui présente Cet article est un ramassis d'énormités. Good, your vegemite isn't welcome here though.As in "not caring about a non-issue ?".Probably because it's a non issue.Now that's out of the way here is what is going to be published any minute now on the instawallet.org frontpage.I'll be around in an hour (time for me to get home) to answer questions, on this thread, and probably on IRC too. Be gentle. Four posts up. Non, personne n'a du mal à récupérer son argent.C'est simplement qu'on ne laisse pas de hot wallet en ligne pour les 2~3 BTC qui sont retirés en moyenne par jour.On rouvre bientôt pour info...Ceux qui ont déjà un compte seront invités en priorité, et nous rouvrirons les inscriptions peu de temps après. Spell it out for a noob, that's how he'll thank you... Should've let you educate yourself. The answer is : "they use another program than Google Authenticator, the same way they can use Firefox instead of Chrome". http://dustwell.com/how-to-handle-passwords-bcrypt.html Why is your browser called Google Chrome? Derp. An update will be posted today. It's an open standard that's in no way specific to Google. How are you legally set up ?If you did your homework correctly you should know that holding funds on behalf of third-parties on a plain corporate account is not only dangerous for a lot of reasons but also illegal.So, I assume you either have a payment service provider license, an electronic money issuer license, an actual partnership deal with ING (which I'm a little doubtful about) or that you don't know what you're doing.Care to enlighten me ?(And sorry, I meant to post this in the dutch thread, but my written dutch is terrible) Planning on a GPG-signed investor contract ?That would be nice, you're on OTC, you have a key, use it, that's what it's for. Als je geen Euros ook houdt hoe kan je een wisselkantoor zijn ? Proceed... Why would you want a solution when there is no problem ? Zou ik ook willen weten. Un envoi est prévu cet après-midi. You don't "gamble slowly".Either you gamble and take your chance against unfavorable odds.Or you let the numbers work for you, but the more you wait the less you gamble.
Which is actually a good thing. It starts with "goo" and ends with "gle". Weet ING dat het een Bitcoin exchange is ? DOTT is the best game ever made. Merci ! Was the begging thread split from the discussion thread? What you are trying to do is quite equivalent to creating a bank from scratch by starting to wonder about what your logo should look like. Crystal clear :-) It would be very nice to have a preview of the fee calculation before divesting.Something that updates dynamically when you change the content of the "amount to divest" field would be terrific. Great, now someone just got to make it look like it's somehow some sort of forbidden cheat xD I think the best that could happed to JD is someone coming up with a martingale script/bot. Words of wisdom. J'approuve et désire ce troquet. How about actually calculating the likelihood ? Doesn't sound like it would be something extremely hard to do.Also thank you Dooglus for your comments!Let me just insist on the GPG thing and develop it a little. The point is not to add some artificial trust by the means of some technical artifact (a GPG-signed commitment is still worthless to you if made by someone you do not trust). The point is simply to very clearly separate what is part of the contract, and what is not. I do not recall addressing you. Ok, so then I'll add another suggestion : "when people lend you their money you don't get to change the rules underway", which intersects quite nicely with "make a GPG contract that I can review and hold you accountable against".I call it simple, issue shares, IPO them, problem solved. Shares are an investment in the management, lending money to the pool is a rational gamble.And that obviously doesn't prevent from using some raised capital to fund the pool (depending on how the IPO is made and the shares issued), at the management's discretion. Oh look, another "let's code first and think after" thread. There are multiple reasons for this view to be incorrect.Firstly, why would I automatically be interested in a growing pool ? It does not necessarily increase my profits, it just reduces my variance.Secondly, this idea does not need advertising, just like bitcoiners have a natural incentive to spread bitcoin, investors have an incentive to promote JD.Thirdly, accounting expenses against the betting pool transforms the value proposition from : - Reverse satoshidice (I'm basically betting my investment with a negative house edge) which is predictable on the long run, to - Reverse satoshidice, with unpredictable expenses, maybe. So if I'm smart I just divest when the forum auction for advertisement space starts and reinvest when it's done, or I'm buddies with the operator and divest before expenses are charged and reinvest afterwards.The correct way to do it is to account for expenses against the site profits (the 1% commission on profits), it doesn't matter whether the 1% commission becomes 2%, it just needs to be predicatble. I'm not investing in a company, I am lending money to it. Apples and oranges.Oh, and last thing, the description sorta contradicts itself :and I would really like to see this cleared up ASAP so I can decide whether I want to throw more money at dooglus or divest.Oh, and last thing, a proper GPG-signed contract for investors would be nice.Overall the idea is terrific, I just think it needs some polishing on the edges. I'll probably convert when it is necessary that the money be sent to Bram.No real interest in converting before. Was this :originally present in the description ?I would like to restrict the usage of my money to funding the pool.
Wow, nice.FTR There is some truth to this  Free money ? Hit me : 1600.How do you define "end of the week" ?In France we're monday right now for example, probably not yet in the US. This case was already settled in post #2 anyway :-)I'm just here for the free popcorn Les gars, le minage c'était cool y a trois and, on est en 2013 la Je m'en souviendrai toute ma vie de mon aller retour à montgallet de novembre 2010  Ok, my initial understanding was incorrect. Learned something today :-)Thanks for enlightening me. Great work! What Loozik says is irrelevant, what is relevant is what Loozik initially promised, as detailed in the OP. Loozik's troll is made even better with his avatar Also OP has yet to prove he is a US citizen and didn't simply provide some random picture like I did before, which would in OPs logic, prove that I am in fact the French/Russian Gérard Depardieu actor. FTFY  Ok, so I'll use the opportunity to clear it up for me, because I apparently misunderstand the way MT works...So, with MT you only have one base currency, and all the rest is expressed in terms of positions on currency pairs relative to your base currency ?Is this correct ? Ou alors les gens se disent que le ROI deviendra positif à posteriori avec une montée future du cours.Ca reste toutefois illogique, car dans ce cas il aurait mieux valu acheter des BTC directement au lieu d'en miner. Sending a picture of a passport does not prove anything.I can send you pictures of hundreds of real passports, I have but one identity.So was it (A) or (B) ? Hey OP, was it (A) or was it (B) you said ? I can't recall.Burden of proof is on you. You did not. Unless you physically showed up before JohnK and showed him your passport.So let me ask again, was it (A) or was it (B) ? This whole thread is about defending your point. So is it (A) or (B). If you answer (A) I will go verify, if the answer is (B) you have just been logically cornered, can drop this whole thing, and move on with something more productive to do with your life. I'll quote myself since OP seems to have missed the precise question here  Dear OP, two choices here :(A) - Have you physically met JohnK ? (B) - Or did you send him a picture of a passport that you claim is yours ? (with possibly someone on the picture that you claim is you)Is it (A), or is it (B) ? The promise requires you to prove that you are a citizen, not that a citizen exists. No, that's purely subjective. Citizenship is an attribute, a title if you will, not something that implies specific contributions and whatnot, liabilities maybe (like pay taxes and stuff), but certainly not any kind of contribution. Nowhere do you get your citizenship removed from you because you fail to do X or Y.I am not a moderator here.Also you still fail to prove the point I brought up a few times in a row Loozik I give your troll 8/10, kudos.Viceroy I give yours 1/10, booo. 
AFAIK MT does not make assumptions about how you get money in and out.If you have questions about it, you should ask kakobrekla on #bitcoin-assets, he's behind bit4xAlso, like I said, the tech is about 5% of the work required for an exchange, and you already seem to have lost quite some time by re-doing everything yourself, the business part is the tough part. If you have to learn it by yourself then so be it, but I strongly suggest you pay very close attention to this particular piece of advice. For one I don't care. Also even if I did, it would prove to me that you sent the picture of a passport to JohnK, not your passport, which you have yet to prove. A US passport does prove it, so does a French passport, but that's just for the sake of being exact  The burden of proof is on you to prove it is your passport, not a passport.So far you have provided no factual proof of this particular claim you are making. I think you're wrong here (but I'm definitely not a MT specialist), MT does not make assumptions as to which pairs you're trading. See previous post, if you want to nitpick, nitpick all the way. Showing a picture of someone holding a matching passport does not prove that you are this person, which was my point, thank you very much.The premise (and yes OP, that is the correct spelling) behind the concept of an identification document is that it authenticates someone physically holding it, the important word here is "physically". I removed it because I felt it didn't sound very good in this particular context, but if you really insist I'll try to re-use it in a better suited context. And it won't be long before it happens if you continue to behave like such a butthurt punk bitch  No offense, but you have pretty much all your points wrong. Any questions ? A smart person would have pointed out that nothing proves that the ID you showed is yours   You already failed the first test : "you should not reinvent the wheel", especially when quite a few open-source wheels already exist. So ? Fun, we shall have some.  L'objectif que nous nous sommes fixés est une réouverture "soft" pour mi-juillet suivie d'une période d'une semaine ou deux avant l'activation des tambours et trompettes.Si tout se passe correctement nous pourrons tenir ce délai, si pour une raison ou pour une autre ce n'est pas possible notre nouveau partenaire financier ne pourra nous mettre en production que début septembre.Nous sommes impatients égalements :-) The good height is when the feet correctly touch the ground. Why are you so butthurt? Your link is quite interesting. If 100$/year is too expensive for you, I strongly suggest you rethink your whole project.
Let me be slightly more specific : - jp.peatio.com -> jp.peatio.ok = DODGY - jp.peatio.com -> peatio.jp = PERFECTLY FINE, but it's usually the other way around That's pretty much the definition of sovereignty.It's the first time I hear such a concern...That would look dodgy as fuck and be counterproductive as hell. you guys still waiting for op to deliver ? How is it that most people do not realize that Bitcoin is somewhat already regulated by all the laws around barter and the various stores of value and that no specific regulation is required for the state to claim taxes on your income/transactions ? The meds, don't forget them. My avatar is Django Reinhardt your argument is invalid. You must be new. You're going to have a bad time here if you don't assume 90% of the forum members are trollish fucktards like our mentally challenged Coinseeker friend. Priceless There are, increase your awareness.I'd be tempted to say it's the other way around, "when the IPO structure is released your business plan will be clear". That'd be assuming dishonesty though, let's not go down this road now.Well then, it's not 100% public owned. Appears more and more misleading the more we start scratching the surface.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_capital and no, it's not a good question. Quoted for later. So, it's 100% publicly owned ? Because the shareholder own it ? So how is it any different than any other exchange owned by its shareholders ? FTR bitcoin-otc.com Make a fuss about it, everyone will care. You must be new here. Parce que tu comptes en faire quoi de ton équipement spécialisé si le cours tombe ?Le revendre à des mecs qui n'ont pas encore appris la nouvelle ? Karpeles is a genius, he creates the panic, which in turn generates volume, which in turn generates fees, which in turn makes him solvent again. <Poof!> Yeah, do just that. That's not a problem with Bitcoin, it's a problem with you. what makes you think lost btc are a problem?
Ah, oui  Vrai. Du coup tu en fais quoi de ce domaine ? Problem with these is that it's hard to get a seller to let you try them out for a ride  SV650S here.Hopefully next one : GSX-R1000Be safe Si tu t'arrêtes à ça tu vas pas aller très loin. Sure, you'll end up in the Roger Wehbe folder if you're lucky. At least you seem gifted with imagination. I was after an executive summary, not a couple of links I could've googled up :-) What's that ? Oh yes, she will. You must be new here A terrorist is usually smarter than a patriot. FTR : http://iccf-holland.org/bitcoin.html Quelle est exactement la question ? Parce que j'ai parcouru ce thread en diagonale et j'y ai surtout vu des âneries.Il n'y a rien d'illégal à miner du BTC sur du matériel d'entreprise pour ensuite le vendre, il n'y a la non plus rien d'intelligent, car vendre du BTC directement implique de facturer de la TVA en sus. Bonne chance pour être rentable avec un différentiel de compétitivité de 20% par rapport au marché.Si tu achètes du matériel sur des fonds sociaux, que leur seul usage est le mining et que tu vends le produit du minage sans passer par ta société c'est de l'ABS caractérisé. Si par contre tu fais ton minage sur des systèmes qui ont par ailleurs un usage "social" je ne vois pas à quel titre on viendrait t'emmerder. This thread is lulz, wonder why the Bitfinex source Bitcoinica source hasn't been re-leaked already. Vous voulez faire ca à quelle date ?Je viendrais avec plaisir, en plus, la moitié de Paymium habite vers Oberkampf :-) Polling = fail Relax. And go do something of your own. It depends on what you call a floating rate exchange. As soon as you touch the clients funds you need a license because you're escrowing them, aka holding them on deposit.The alternative is "we buy from the seller, and sell to the buyer in the very same operation, the money on deposit is just a pre-payment to us" but then the whole VAT mess sneaks back in.So your thing is "Bitcoins aren't sold or bought, only their 'property titles' are negotiated" that's really interesting. I'll look into it  Surprisingly, becoin is right, if you sell stuff there's VAT.Oh, so that's where you were going, be a fixed-rate exchanger, sell BTC, pay VAT on sales but find some sort of category that benefits from a VAT full/partial exemption and get lawyers to make it fit in said category. Right?
Just for the few people here who seem a little confused : Bitcoin is legally neither currency, nor electronic money. Yes, email me. Have fun decrypting my encrypted traffic. Et dans le fond il n'a pas tout à fait tort. Ceci dit, AMHA le problème vient plutôt du fait que toute notre société est basée sur l'usure, plutôt que sur le fait d'accorder trop d'importance à la finance. Sure, as long as you rate me on OTC afterwards :-)Bram said he would publish it on the vim mailing list, I didn't subscribe so I don't know if he did it yet, he asked if he could publish the address on the ICCF website which I advised him to do.Either way, if you can't wait to donate you can e-mail him directly and/or ask Mike Hearn for confirmation (he helped convince Bram, they know each other IRL, they both work in Google's Zurich offices).What does everyone think I should use to get the funds converted ? Since BC isn't back up yet I'm thinking about either Bitstamp or OTC (my heart goes towards OTC ) Actually it is not possible. Probably watched too much "Lord of War" and never actually went to Africa. You don't need to pledge anymore since there is now a donation address, you can donate directly.I don't think there is any amount needed per se, the more the better, it goes to kids in Uganda (see http://iccf-holland.org) Think about the overlap in Unix geeks/Vim users. I believe it's big. I also believe that having a Bitcoin address on the splash screen of Vim (where you already get prompted to donate to kids in Uganda) will be a curiosity-igniter for some geeks that didn't know about Bitcoin, and a reason to think again for those who previously dismissed it as scam/ponzi. Je passe mon tour, merci pour la réponse! En gros t'as 300Mhs pour combien ? Okay so I got a positive answer from Bram Molenaar (a few days ago actually).For the time being I will be collecting the donations and handle the exchange part.So people who have pledged, and trust me, may already send their donations to 13UUaGK8ZDLxjY7RYu2bKEabqjww2KDyxDIf you want to have your name published on the Vim website you'll have to sign a message with one of the addresses sending the donation.I asked Bram Molenaar if he could confirm this in any way and will update the thread accordingly. I guess it's just the coupons then. There are the coupons, but you also transfer fiat when you exchange. Nonsense, volatility is actually reduced by an increase in volume.The difference in price that is observed is due to the fact that the MTGUSD is declining in value after the US-seizure ongoing shitstorm. Aaah, j'avais pas vu que ce serait sur Bruxelles, une prochaine fois pê :-)Je prendrai la journée pour l'occasion LOL, this Yo, so what.I give you 2/10 I'm in. Last edition was lots of fun, got to talk with quite a few interesting people, all this in Timisoara which is a very nice city. Si quelqu'un organise je viendrai :-)
Cet article est un torchon fourré de contre vérités et de d'affirmations factuellement incorrectes. You must be new here. There was no cgminer back in 2010, aticonfig did the job just fine. Your Bitcointalk account. Not sucking, pretty much Dear Edan, could you please explain what "recognizing crypto-currencies" means in the context of an "unregulated" country.Why would you even need to recognize crypto-currencies in any way if you're keeping the book of law as thin as possible ?Hardly makes sense to me. But I'm genuinely interested in the answer.An unregulated country would need two basic laws "Don't do to others what you wouldn't want them to do to you", and "mind your own fucking business". Other than that I don't really see any other things that could add value.Guess we'll see what comes out of the conference, but feel free to answer here nonetheless :-) They are allowed, it's just not smart to do it France is unregulated too.You can do whatever you want as long as you don't get caught :-) To whichever mod deleted my post featuring a perfectly on-topic racist joke : Please proceed to getting a clue.The accounts feature does not scale in bitcoind, once you pass a few 10k accounts it starts slowing everything down.These problems instantly go away as soon as you start doing the accounting externally. Don't use the "accounts" feat. it doesn't scale.Manage accounts yourself in whatever data store you're using. Because they've finally gotten a hold of someone at the Baker&McKenzie offices ? :-)Because they decided to silently cover it with their pile of cash ?Who knows ?  That's what brokers do, not exchanges.Bitcoin brokers exist, look them up. Lol wtf. You don't magically "solve" the network effect.Especially if your forum nick was registered three months ago.So much stupidity in here it hurts. +1Not at all.People usually start with small deposits and move on from there, if you can deliver trust is usually not an issue.The problem is the network effect, liquidity is attracted by liquidity. This can be mitigated by a couple of things : affiliate programs that get you lots of subscriptions, and cutting deals with market makers, or market making yourself. You just decreased the signal/noise ratio.I'm analyzing the exact right thing. I e-mailed Bram Molenaar this afternoon suggesting he should put a donation address on vim's splash screen so people who loved vim could help him help children in Uganda.In his response he basically said that he didn't really know Bitcoin, that he thought not much people used it, and that he didn't think it would stick around.So basically what I want to do is to collect some donation promises.So if you love vim and want to promise some amount, whatever it is, just state it here.I'll start and promise to donate 5 BTCEDIT :  There's also a Reddit post that you may want to up vote :-)TL;DR : Vim donations address : 13UUaGK8ZDLxjY7RYu2bKEabqjww2KDyxD Donated : 6 BTCPledged but not received yet : 5 BTC That isn't a MSB, it is a company that sells something that falls in the default category of goods/services.To be specific, what they sell is the service of digitally signing chunks of data that have some mutually-agreed-upon properties. Here you go, all the documents I have related to this case :https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52452135/MACARAJA_DOCS.zipYou'll want to look at the last one if you want the conclusions.What do you mean by your last question? Yeah, the document I linked basically says "we'll settle it on September 13th", can't seem to find the document for that though, I had it at some point, if you want I'll have a look. The story *will* repeat in Poland, and in Slovenia as a matter of fact.It's not that they're doing anything that I'd find morally wrong, it's that they let themselves be completely vulnerable from a regulatory PoV.It's not in anyone's interest. I wish them the best too, because the more people share the Bitcoin pie, the bigger and tastier it becomes.
Yes, if it worked like mtgox (escrowing the funds in the middle) it would qualify as a money transmission business.It's not specific to Bitcoin at all. It could have been the exact same with Magic the Gathering playing cards.Keep in mind that this issue is more specific than that, it targets only the US subsidiary, not MtGox itself.There are other resources, mostly in French though - http://www.fs-reboot.eu/static/2011/09/Ordonnance-de-Référé-31-août-2011.pdfIf you find a way to read French I'll help you find the other available documents.That time they got out of it OK because the plaintiff was the bank, not the government, and they simply ended up kicked out, not with funds seized/frozen.And it was exactly for the same reasons, like really exactly, Macaraja argued that they were simply an "intermédiaire commercial" and not a money transmitter which the judge found to be nonsense according to the facts presented. The example is badly chosen, but the gist is right, it does not matter whether Dwolla was involved, it would have been the same with bank wires, with whatever. They transmitted money, without being licensed and that's the problem. Whether or not Mark Karpeles lied is largely irrelevant, it's not the bank that's going after him, it's the DHS, and not for lying, for doing things that require a license without having said license. And trust me, MK knows exactly what he's doing and the risks involved.And of course transferring money is legal, but you need a license if you're a corporation doing it for clients...It doesn't change anything. Had MtGox gone through an american bank instead and accept wires directly it would have been the exact same. Just because the entry point is licensed doesn't make the whole thing licensed. If they wanted to do things properly they should have had Dwolla itself hold the funds. Again, whether MK lied or not is not really relevant here, if he had he answered "Yes" instead of "No" (and assuming for the sake of the argument that the bank would still have granted the account) he would have been in trouble the exact same way today.Just because you put a proxy between yourself and the customer doesn't change anything. Look at it this way, had Dwolla been a bank it would have been the same, had Dwolla been instead multiple banks sending wires around, each one proxying the other, it would have been the same.And after all Dwolla was accepting funds on an account in Mutum Sigillum's name. Which means that Mutum Sigillum was accepting funds.You don't make sense. Re-read what I wrote, it'll sink in.So what? I just explained to you what I discussed with MK, there's really nothing more to it. The rest of the discussion was about Yubikeys and other unrelated stuff.Like I said, mtgox did in fact eat some dirt in France in 2011. Like I said for the exact same reasons.Do your homework, google it. Still not. Dwolla is MtGox's financial services provider, not the other way around. The proper way would have been : - All US customer funds held at Dwolla, - Your MtGox USD balance being merely a simple display of your personal Dwolla balance - MtGox moving USD around *among Dwolla accounts*If not it doesn't fall in the "simple technical provider of a licensed financial entity" category.And again MtGox wasn't transferring funds in order to sell Bitcoins directly, but to intermediate the sale and purchase of Bitcoins. And no, the fact that the money transmission was relevant to a sale doesn't apply here, re-read what you quoted and see the little detail : "by the person who is accepting and transmitting the funds."Is it clearer this way ?Guess what, it could perfectly have been planned. Because for one you just need to use your brain to figure it out, and oh, I also discussed this very topic with Mark in... wait for it... July 2011.Any questions ? Could have been true, but only if funds were going in and out *only* through Dwolla. It wasn't the case.That would have been true if mtgox sold you Bitcoins directly, which wasn't the case since they aren't counterparty to the transactions (see their ToS, it's also plain common sense)So no, gox doesn't fall in either category, for the reasons outlined.What mtgox sells is the service of matching buyers with sellers, they do not sell, nor buy Bitcoins.Like I said this is wrong, mtgox makes its money from selling you an intermediation service, not Bitcoins.You can't possibly be serious. Look up the 'CIC v MACARAJA' French case. In this particular case, MtGox got in trouble for the exact same reasons.Apparently no lesson was learned, because they're getting in trouble in the US for the same reasons, and will eventually get in trouble in Poland, again, for the very same reasons.What is even more naive is to believe that rules don't get bent over multi-million dollar market shares. Especially if MK had the intention to sell his US activity to coinlab. You can get away if you lie, but you need to have an exit strategy. Obviously the exit strategy failed.What do you think this coinlab deal was about ? Yes that's right, it was good for coinlab because they'd have bought a good source of revenue, and it would have been excellent for mtgox because it would have allowed them to move out of the US market and this legal nightmare.Whether you use a stick or a gun to hurt someone makes little difference, you're hurting someone.Whether you intermediate through Dwolla or not doesn't change anything. EXCEPT if everything goes through Dwolla and mtgox only moves funds between Dwolla accounts as part of the trade settlement process.The reason why they didn't accept wires directly to their US account is (I assume) that it would have raised a shitload of AML red-flags at their bank.I don't think it is. The prediction is quite simple : if you break the law you'll eventually get in trouble.Yup, and it's not even relevant to this cases. They didn't say the Bitcoin side of things was relevant at all. You assumed that.What is relevant is the unlicensed money transmission. Read it again, it is written very clearly.It performs a currency exchange each time it matches orders with different currencies. That is factual.Whether random people on the internet think it is important or not doesn't change that.It is not because some X thing is judged more important than some other Y thing that the Y thing immediately disappears.If you want to discuss legalities it's best to remain factual. So what, it mentions "currency exchange" which is what my point is about, they exchange currency automatically because their trading engine is built that way, USD orders could match EUR orders and it would transparent for the users.Which is technically brilliant, but legally stupid.See previous comment, you miss the detail, their engine does it *automatically*.I'm not saying that it's what they're being charged for, but it's one of the things they *could* be charged for if a judge bother to look into the details. I think you are wrong, their multi-currency engine does it implicitly.Devil is in the details. 1. si ce n'est pas urgent ca attendra2. oui, comme vous le mentionnez vous-même BC et paytunia sont la même application, vos BTC "Paytunia" sont accessibles par Bitcoin-Central Whoops Nice ! Réessayez, on a apporté une correction.Tenez moi au courant. Les stops ? Si c'est ca oui j'aimerais bien  bitcoin-otclocalbitcoins:-) Ce sera possible quand nous relancerons le service, ce qui n'est pas prévu avant au moins un mois. Oui.Aussi.C'est exact.Non, dès qu'elles sont validées ou rejetées les pièces sont cryptées avec PGP. Seule la clef publique est présente sur le serveur.Dans les cas ou il est nécessaire de ressortir une pièce cette dernière est téléchargée cryptée puis décryptée localement. Nous avons du retard dans le traitement des virements sortants et dans le traitement du support.Ce retard est du principalement à l'afflux de nouveaux clients qui n'est pour l'instant pas suivi d'une augmentation des effectifs du support. Les tarifs n'ont pas changé :-) Tout dépend de la date d'exécution du virement par votre banque, ce n'est par ailleurs pas parce qu'il est marqué "traité" dans votre interface qu'il est à proprement parler "executé" au sens bancaire. Pour l'instant ce n'est pas prévu, nous aimerions revoir notre interface en profondeur ceci dit, je pense que ca pourrait faire partie du package.Ca existe, vous avez une case à cocher dans vos préférences de compte.Non, si vous êtes inactif pendant une demie heure il semble normal de se faire déconnecter.Non. No.We can pull them for you if you request it.It is being used in production, but the API isn't considered stable enough yet to be properly documented.Could you be a little more specific ?
Un code de confirmation par mail peut-être intéressant, ceci dit j'ai un peu peur que cela induise un faux sentiment de sécurité.En effet si votre boîte mail est compromise votre mot de passe peut-être changé, et le code de confirmation ne sera d'aucune aide puisqu'il sera envoyé sur une boîte compromise. Vous l'avez :-)Vous avez GA, ou Yubikey.Les Yubikey mtgox sont compatibles uniquement avec mtgox.Si vous achetez une Yubikey chez Yubico directement elle fonctionnera partout, sauf chez mtgox.Il n'est pas prévu pour l'instant de mettre en place une authentification par SMS, mais c'est une bonne idée Si vous avez un compte vérifié ce qu'on fait dans ces cas la c'est qu'on redemande le scan de pièce d'identité que vous avez chargé.Si vous n'êtes pas vérifié on procède de la même manière en vérifiant que la pièce correspond à des virements entrants/sortants passés sur votre compte.Quand vous activez GA vous avez dans la pop-up le secret partagé qui est affiché en clair en complément du QR code, si vous le sauvegardez vous aurez tout ce qu'il faut pour re-paramétrer GA manuellement.Pour ce qui est des lenteurs sur le trading on a apporté des modifications hier après-midi et hier soir pour améliorer la situation. Le lag devrait-être considérablement réduit. No, I'm saying money-related businesses in Europe are regulated and that these regulations are unfortunately not optional. Yep, if you don't care about your funds being protected they're perfect  No. If you want to remain fully anonymous we're not the right place for you, sorry about that.Just remember that, as soon as you use the banking system your anonymity is gone, no exceptions.Cheers! The ECB doesn't have the power to introduce compulsory stuff.They can pressure very hard but not make anything mandatory.Just saying :-) nbsp -> non-breakable space oOThat's like... by design That's because when the last maintenance occurred your wallet had a zero balance.If you haven't sent funds to the old address all is fine, use the new address and the old one.If you did send funds I'll have to fix your balance manually.We archived a lot of addresses to alleviate the load on our bitcoind, the site was becoming extremely slow, the addresses are just archived though, no funds are lost.And no, we can't simply re-import the private key, it would block the client for the time of a whole chain rescan. :-)So send an e-mail to the support if something needs to be done on our side.Cheers! Il y a une limite par défaut a 500 EUR/jour mais on l'augmente sur simple demande si vous le souhaitez.C'est plus une mesure de protection de votre compte qu'une mesure de limitation. These boards are full of really weird people.I like it here. Thank you, he almost got me.You're like squidward in a delicious spongebob thread. I'm about to get a yoshimura exhaust on my SV650S but if you're offering I wouldn't mind to keep it for the GSX-1000R you're getting me :-) Toi je sens qu'on va t'inviter à venir prendre le café chez Paymium dis donc  They did offer, a long time ago, the option to fund your account through the LiqPay credit card processor. It has also been dropped a while ago obviously Casascius did it a long time before you. You're funny.You probably didn't even know how to spell "Bitcoin" when MtGox started accepting credit cards for account fundings. Ben au moins il s'intéresse, mieux vaut tard que jamais :-) Numbers : they're cold, they're hard, but they have their uses.I hope for you that you don't do finance the same way you do your estimations. Well, I'm just pulling assumptions and figures out of my ass like you just did.All the sock puppets probably compensate for the people that are active in Bitcoin land but don't have an account here.It's still better to use available figures and pull *some* things out of your ass rather than pull *everything* out of your ass. Stinks slightly less, deal with it.  - 2806 * 30 accounts on btctalk - 3282 WoT accounts~4% of BitcoinLand is in the WoT. Just saying.
You should add Bitcoin-Central.net for EUR and Bitstamp for USD  No worries, thanks a lot for suggesting this useful feature !The trigger for displaying the message is "have you been redirected to a wallet (existing or not) directly from a referrer other than Instawallet itself".For example the warning will trigger even if you're redirected to a wallet that didn't exist before, but with a key already embedded in the URL.With the increase in price it becomes more and more important to provide additional security features since people seem to ignore the fact that Instawallet shouldn't be used to store large amounts of coins. Bonjour Tivoli c'est de l'histoire ancienne, maintenant BC est simplement intermédiaire et paie à l'état Français de la TVA sur la commission de trading. TVA que vous pouvez récupérer si vous avez un compte entreprise via les factures qui vous sont données.BC est maintenant géré par Paymium, société Française.Bitcoin-Central et Paytunia sont deux front-ends pour la même application et partagent exactement la même base de données.A terme il n'est pas impossible que BC soit entièrement remplacé par Paytunia, mais cela n'aura pas d'autre conséquence qu'un changement cosmétique. https://instawallet.org/w/howaboutcheckingifithasntalreadybeenimplementedbeforeasking  Hahaha, you're awesome, I love you! Like most things it's a trade off, you need to trust blockchain to not feed you bogus data and you need to have your use case covered by their API.Oh, and like any service they sometimes have outages, but on the other hand maybe you'll have outages of your own bitcoind.If you can avoid running the client locally I'd advise to use the blockchain API. I don't really know OKPay that much, do they have anonymous debit cards? if so it's doubtful that the funds be segregated. But hey I don't know, I'm not OKPay, so it's purely speculation. Hey, just out of curiosity, are there actually some people who still think they're going to deliver ?Are they the same people still waiting for a pirate payout ? Bitcoin-Central rocks. Try us out.There's also Bitstamp. Bitstamp isn't financially regulated so you have much less legal protection.Disclaimer : I'm part of the team that operates BC :-) You have an account there, you get shaved, OK pay doesn't get taxed, the customer does.As much as the shaving is retarded the fact that the customer pays is plain logical.There's just one thing, the accounts should be segregated so the lower tax tier should be applied. L'émission serait le 26 mars si j'ai bien compris, donc ca colle pas trop avec le meetup de toute façon. BonsoirBizarrement on a eu pas mal ce problème avec les banques belges.C'est bien sur complètement illégal, illégitime, tout ce que vous voulez.Par contre vous y êtes également quand même un peu pour quelque chose dans la mesure ou vous n'insistez pas vraiment. Avez-vous tenté d'écrire au médiateur, envisageriez-vous de déposer plainte ?Accepteriez-vous d'être un relais local si nous déposions plainte contre la BNP pour entrave ? I didn't spit on anyone, I just considered myself lucky, that's all. But I do love your proverb.Sucks for all those that got a haircut.And you're definitely right, nobody is immune. wow, glad I did not follow up on their e-mails to integrate their service into Bitcoin-Central Not the first one, not the last one. Yo. (unfortunately I was unable to locate a "internet high-five" smiley) It's not a matter of "if" it's a matter of "when".Don't hold euros, period. Whoops, forgot to answer this one.If your question is : "what prevents the state from shaving the exchange's account the same way Cyprus shaved its citizens accounts" the answer is : nothing. Dear Bruno,Instawallet has always worked like a shared wallet, nothing has ever changed in this respect.The fact you used to see coins remain at the deposit address simply means that : - there used to be less coin turnover, - the cold storage was less used, - any combination of the previous reasons.Some stuff does change though, you used to get your transaction ID back immediately when sending coins, that's not the case anymore, sends are now asynchronously handled by a background worker. That's much more secure in terms of potential race conditions, much more robust in terms of infrastructure, much more maintenable (since now I can simply stop the worker, do some work on bitcoind and switch it back on).The traffic also increases a lot, to give you an idea, our average weekly turnover is around 10kBTC in, and 10kBTC out, it recently peaked at around 50kBTC/week.Your wallet has exactly the amount you expect to be available, you can't rely on blockchain.info to tell you how much is available in an account on a shared wallet.This is how your balance is calculated :Hope it's clearer  We don't do ads, we do interviews.You confuse cynicism and irrelevance.By the way, welcome !That what she said ? mister big ? ;-)Yea, these too.You forgot to add French specials !
Guess I should You probably mean your own IBAN, right?Well, it's coming. As you may or may not know this kind of project requires a very tight integration. And that's neither easy nor instant. We're working on it and are eagerly awaiting the possibility to roll it out.I know! Me too! I really can't wait to close all my bank accounts, have my debit card and IBAN at Bitcoin-Central/Paytunia and only touch fiat currency when I really have no other choice.In fact there is already "bank accounting" going on. If you have a fiat balance with us that means you have your own named sub-account in our specific segregated bank account. Like I said in the original announcement, lots of the work we do is unseen  Sorry for the earlier rant, that was uncalled for.I could have expressed the same thing without being so aggressive.My apologies.Lesson : never post when you did not have your first cup of coffee.Have a nice day all, and don't hesitate to notify me of any issue. Ahem, you don't want PHP, C++, or {insert whatever language here}You want something that serves a specific purpose, ease of maintenance, performance, etc.Why not Ruby+Redis ? Why not Node.js+Mongodb ? Why not Erlang+Cassandra ? Why not PHP+MySQL ?It's not the tool that matters, it's the skill with which you use it. If you're developing exchange software with all the features you mention integrating Bitcoin is the easiest part.Get your swaps/forwards/options working and then we'll talk  Sorry, that's actually completely wrong. Transactions *do* happen, even between Instawallets. Bitcoin-Central.net is offering a Cyprus special. Bitcoin is something that markets itself, don't worry about the world it'll take care of itself.People from Cyprus won't need us to educate them about Bitcoin when their accounts get shaved off of 5% to 10% (not sure about the exact figure), trust me, they'll find out about it :-) During the next two weeks any new account opened by a citizen from Cyprus will enjoy a 0% trading fee on his two first deposits ! Salut,Toute la doc pour l'API est ici : https://github.com/paytunia/api-documentationVa voir à "Read the market depth", par contre, pour ce qui est des quotes, le taux garanti est calculé avec un algo propriétaire qui n'a pas nécessairement de lien direct avec la profondeur de marché.Pour ce qui est de l'adjudication du carnet d'ordres c'est relativement simple, si tu précises ta/tes questions j'y répondrai avec plaisir. That doesn't do anything, transactions between Instawallets happen in the database and are not broadcast to the network.Also, regarding your issue : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6785.msg1630660#msg1630660 Hey, why don't you open an additionnal 10 threads complaining about this issue ?Don't forget to send 5 PMs and 3 e-mails to the support. Oh wait, you can also tweet and facebook it.Hey, and maybe you want my personal phone number to text me every five minutes about your 50 BTC ?And you know, my personal address to stand in front of my door, knock every 30 seconds and wonder if I'm taking care of your issue.Protip : If you have an issue with Instawallet send an e-mail to the support, and look at a calendar, if the current date is a saturday or a sunday, chances are I am currently not working, so kick back, read a book, get some flowers for your wife, do something interesting, go have a walk, get some good time. You will be taken care of. Nagging about your issue using every possible channel is just incredibly rude and useless.I work almost every day to take care of stuff and help where help is needed, Instawallet is a free service, so I'd appreciate not being constantly harassed by people who think waiting twelve hours is too much and that they're the only ones to need attention. If you don't like this please go store your coins elsewhere.Thank you very much for your understanding and consideration. Pas vraiment, car en faisant ca il prendrait le risque de se faire pincer avant d'avoir vidé les clefs. Tu pourrais me rétorquer que le site blockchain.info peut toujours injecter du code malicieux qui renvoie tes clefs sans que tu le saches.C'est une des failles de blockchain.info, ceci dit il faudrait que ce soit vraiment délibéré de la part du propriétaire de blockchain, en cas de hack, si un hacker change le code JS envoyé à ton brouteur tu seras alerté par l'extension côté client qui vérifie le code (cette extension est optionnelle).Et même si le propriétaire de blockchain.info injectait du code de cette façon il ne pourrait voler les utilisateurs qu'un par un. Il ne pourrait pas partir avec toute la caisse d'un coup.Donc un modèle de sécurité qui se situe entre le shared wallet, et le client standalone. C'est beau Bitcoin, y en a pour tous les goûts :-) Tu cliques sur "Retirer" :-) C'est incorrect. Les wallets blockchain.info sont cryptés avec AES, ils sont décryptés uniquement dans le browser avec ton mot de passe, toute la partie crypto se fait dans le browser.Ca n'enlève pas toute possibilité de vol, mais le modèle de sécurité est quand même très avancé. Why not, I don't know much about litecoin at all though. Way too busy with Bitcoin Is it getting very popular ? Le client standalone est le logiciel que vous installez sur votre ordinateur qui télécharge toute la chaîne de block.Par opposition à un client web qui vous donne une ou plusieurs addresses mais ne nécessite pas ce téléchargement.Oui, c'est ce que je dis :-) What I say is in the context of French law. If you are billed a purchase that was unauthorized the bank *has* to refund you, you do not have to prove the transaction was not authorized. The rationale behind it is that if you did not input your PIN for a transaction the burden of proof is on the merchant, not on you.What I'm trying to say is that your bank would probably have refunded you even without proof because (at least where I live) they are legally obliged to.I think it stems from the fact that credit/debit cards are inherently insecure because you can pull money from them simply by knowing some digits, there is no authentication in the payment mechanism when you simply pay on the internet. I assume this legal obligation has been lobbied for by Visa/Mastercard because if it weren't so the insecurity of this payment scheme would be extremely obvious an no-one would want such a card.Of course, I don't know anything about the laws in your country but I'd tend to assume they are somewhat similar in this respect.From the consumer point of view it is much harder to reverse.Which is exactly what 3DS is for.Yes, well actually it's the opposite, you can prove that the transaction authorization was done with 3DS.You are correct for Visa, however, in MasterCard terminology it is called MasterCard SecureCode.Keep in mind that the protection offered by 3DS varies with the country of the buyer. If you want to guarantee a payment, simply relying on 3DS is not sufficient. Please comment only if you have something interesting to say, and do add which legal framework you are referring to.It is false to say that only legal tender is "recognized" by law. E-currency is not legal tender, yet it is considered money by European regulation.The distinction between e-currency, virtual currency, stored value, etc. is definitely non-trivial and doesn't care for mere opinions, in Europe they all have specific regulatory requirements and definitions.For example, Paypal is e-currency in Europe, because it is a claim on its issuer expressed in fiat. So no, just dealing with Paypal does not shield you from the regulatory burden.
We don't specifically care about Tor on Instawallet (or any of our services actually). There's nothing wrong with it, the only thing is that we have automated security triggers that will ban IPs that run port or vulnerability scans at the firewall level. In this case you'll end up with a timed-out request. Which is probably what you are experiencing.EasyWallet isn't quite the same as Instawallet, the base concept is the same but they have (I assume) a lower volume, but also original features that set them apart (oh and they're not free, but I don't think that should be the main thing on which you should base your choice). And it's run by a nice guy. Je vous conseille très fortement la v0.8Beaucoup de changements liés aux performances ont été apportés dans cette version qui devraient accélérer les temps de chargement.Par ailleurs il est normal que plus le téléchargement avance, plus il ralentisse. En effet, le nombre de transaction par block croit avec l'usage de Bitcoin dans le temps, et par extension avec le numéro de bloc.Si vous voulez accéder rapidement à votre argent sans attendre le chargement vous avez toujours la possibilité d'exporter vos clefs privées et les charger dans un wallet blockchain.info.Personnellement je n'utilise plus le client standalone sur ma machine, je n'en vois tout simplement pas l'intérêt. Congratulations !If TC leaves you some time and you're looking for a job in Europe drop us a line with your resume  Yep, they moved to Poland after getting sued (and losing the case) in France by the bank they had there.Actually they don't have any kind of license at all, do you see a financial registration number on their website? Me neither. (And Bitstamp is in the exact same situation)That might come as a surprise to some folks, but in order to collect deposits from the public and maintain a fiat balance on their behalf you need to comply with certain licensing and auditing requirements.The advantage of the licensing is that the customer are legally segregated from the company's funds. MtGox didn't get heavily fined in France, good for them, but if they had been fined the money would have been taken from their French account because it would legally belong to the mtgox company, not to their customers. When things are done properly, the company holding the fiat funds on behalf of its customers can go bankrupt without the client funds being in danger, because legally it does not belong to the company itself, but to its customers. Complying with the law gives the customer a much better protection. That's just because they don't have a proper license to do what they do in Europe. And they know it perfectly well. Je me permets de changer le titre de ce thread étant donné qu'au fil du temps il se transforme en questions/réponses/discussions autour de Bitcoin-Central.Si l'OP n'est pas d'accord avec ce changement qu'il me le dise et je remettrai le titre original. Stop your spam.I received like five copy-paste mails at each of my addresses.Apparently you also spam irrelevant threads. J'en serai. At the exact moment I was about to go to bed I check my mailbox and I have this e-mail from a Bitcoin-Central user that I know, basically says "SHUT YOUR BITCOIND NAOOO".Which I did. There was a chain fork due to a bug in 0.7 that was triggered by 0.8. The choice was made to have chains converge on the 0.7 version.Since instawallet runs a patched client that is 0.6 it isn't affected and will work fine as soon as the chains converge, until then transaction confirmations will slow down. Critical: Current Bitcoin network fork. Action needed by mining pools. Merchants should hold transactions.Valid reason ?But apparently our bitcoind version is not affected. Should be back to normal in minutes. Excellente réponse, je dirais par contre que dans le cas des VM c'est la plus value qui est imposée.Pour ce qui est de la TVA en tant que particulier ce n'est pas applicable, à moins d'en faire une activité "habituelle", de toute façon je pense qu'en dessous des seuils de CA de l'auto entrepreneur le risque est faible.Je ne pense pas que Bitcoin puisse être considéré comme un compte bancaire, ni d'ailleurs un compte mtgox étant donné que mtgox n'a aucune license bancaire ou financière.Idéalement ce serait considéré comme une devise, on peut toujours rêver.Pour ce qui est du rescrit c'est une excellente idée, mais ca reste limité parce que tu proposes une interprétation et l'administration approuve ou pas, si elle n'approuve pas tu n'es pas plus avancé parce qu'elle ne te donne pas de réponse.Le sujet mérite d'être creusé, tiens nous au courant de tes démarches  La traduction usuelle pour une collection de clefs au sens crypto est plutôt trousseau de clefs que porte clefs.Ok je sors. Merde, la porte est fermée à.... clef.BADUM-TSSSSS SEPA should theoretically be one business day.15 days? I say fractional reserve. I think what he's trying to say is that wardrivers will also go around randomly and infect people with malware through whatever vulnerability they can find. Honestly I haven't heard about this and I think it's doubtful that this is what happened. By the way, can someone change the title of this thread ?You don't have to trust me, but if you want to accuse me, do it in a scam accusations thread. Be careful, you'll end up with customers. Whoops Someone quick sell me earplugs for BTC. Instawallet works fine.Have you been recently pounding hard on the API ? On Bitcoin-Central's API ?Have you been running vulnerability scanners against either of these ?Because if that's the case you'll automatically end up with your IP blacklisted in iptables. Not really, if bank isn't legally obliged to take money out of its pocket it won't.That's what banks do. They'll sometimes go around this and waive some fees for example, but that'll be because you're a high value customer to them and that they expect to make it back somehow.
Unfortunately banks just don't work that way. Well, that also goes if anyone tries to access the https wallet directly through http.If you access the base URL with http it will redirect you first to the https version before redirecting you to a wallet.Because I love customers Also psy is right, the previous owner wanted to sell it, it wasn't going to close though, other buyers were interested. In France you're not liable if 3D Secure wasn't used. Banks try to avoid taking responsibility but they legally have to.Hopefully the law is similar where you are.I'm not really sure about the liabilities when 3D Secure was used, but that's not really your case. It's kind of weird that they'll still issue EUR codes, because if they did want to comply with European regulations they'd stop those too.And actually if they really wanted to comply with said regulations they'd stop servicing EUR customers too. There are numerous possibilities, unfortunately and AFAIK, nobody notified the support about this problem. And without any way to identify the wallet there is obviously no way for me to investigate. Let's have a look at the facts before starting to guess.People debating about the security of wifi forget that the traffic is SSL-encrypted anyway.I'll add as a kind reminder that SSL sits on top of TCP but under HTTP, meaning that the secret URL is never sent in clear over the internet. The few affected wallets display a big red warning, but if you don't have access to this wallet and only the URL sure, send the address and I'll tell you if it's one of them.Well, actually the best solution would be to have one single wallet with tools to efficiently clean it from time to time.Yep, and it's red too. Your bank wouldn't know that.It's more likely that your own bank is blocking transfers to bitstamp's account because fraudulent transfers from your bank occurred with bitstamps account as destination, and your bank sees it's easier to blacklist bitstamp's account than to actually improve their own security and prevent fraudulent transfers to happen in the first place.Go to your bank manager, make a fuss about it and your transfer will be sent. Trust me on this.That's the way we do support at Bitcoin-Central, we'll even help you to use the competition  Rescanning the chain against a very large wallet takes a very long time, a long time you have to multiply by the number of keys to import.Quite a long time during which Instawallet has to be put into maintenance mode. It should now be fully fixed.What happened is that for a few hours the backend was talking to the wrong bitcoind. That's purely my fault, I messed up a configuration setting during the course of a routine maintenance.Wallets created against this Bitcoin client will have to be discarded as their private key is unknown to the main Bitcoin client. Therefore it won't notify incoming transactions properly, affected wallets will fail to see their balance properly updated.At this point their balance should be correct though, I fixed it so affected users can move their funds to another instawallet or to any arbitrary address.If funds are still accidentally sent to an affected wallet they will have to be accounted for manually.I apologize for the inconvenience to all affected users. SSL encryption, makes it impossible to compromise a wallet by sniffing traffic between the client and the server. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6785.msg1605228#msg1605228 I'll keep it short : - It's not isolated, other users are affected - I'm working on it - No funds were lost, it's not a hack, - It'll probably take another hour before affected users can access their funds What for ? To compact them ?Still sounds like a good thing to me  I really haven't given this topic that much thought, so I don't really have an opinion.The idea of giving an incentive to compact outputs is sounds pretty good to me though, but clearly, it should not be the only thing to consider.I don't think your example really adds up, correct me if I'm wrong but in order to be able to "repeat" like you say, you need to be able to re-create a lot of outs, and if the fee increases by the number of outs, you'll end up paying a lot in fees. So unless you have access to an unlimited number of unspent outs the process you describe simply does not work.Thoughts ? Hi all.Just a few of things : - We didn't steal coins, the thread title should be changed OR it should be moved to the "Scam accusations" board. OPs call. - Security isn't as straightforward as almost everyone here seems to suggest. OPs machine was compromised, in which case it doesn't matter whether you store your coins on Instawallet, Blockchain.info, on your local Bitcoin client, a paper wallet, or a multiple factor authentication setup. Compromised machine = stolen coins, period.That being said I want to re-state very firmly that this kind of theft sickens me on multiple levels, that I feel very sorry for OPs loss and that Instawallet will cooperate fully if the OP decides to file a police report or investigate this himself. Well, isn't compacting the amount of unspent outputs a good thing ? Great article!Guess Matonis changed his mind about the whole regulation thing  I don't really get why all this fuss, I can't really figure a valid reason for such a patch at this point. I have an absolute neutral opinion about SD, I don't use it and don't care either way.Let's get back to reasons for such a patch : - Saving CPU cycles - Saving disk space - Saving bandwith - [other ?]Saving CPU cycles ? Meh. Read Mike Hearn's excellent article about scalability for the figures.Saving disk space ? Your patch doesn't help, SD txes will eventually make it into a block. (Unless of course everyone is using your patch).Saving bandwith ? Come on. You still using a 56k ? Shits given = 0. Happy?The french chick inside you must be expressing herself, because you're making ridiculous amounts of drama about such a useless and pointless thing. International woman's day was yesterday, you're a bit off schedule. Redeemable code = ability to transfer money between accounts = you're a bank or a payment institution.Took them quite some time to realize that 
Yes, I can.I'm saying it's retarded, not questioning your right to retardedness. See the difference? If a system is broken, fix the system, don't blame the abuser.Yup, let's ask abusers to be nice to the system and stop abusing it, because you know, it's not nice.It just doesn't work that way.EDIT :  Also this patch is pointless, you probably spent more CPU cycles browsing this thread than you'll spend verifying SD txes for a full year. You're wrong Setting up a socket.io stack isn't trivial.It got easier with the last version of nginx, but as far as I recall it has always required some fiddling around.Socket.io doesn't support SSL natively AFAIK, so their setup probably uses stunnel to run the WS traffic in an SSL tunnel.And stunnel is not exactly what I'd call stable. You should reword your title, you make it sound like Prestashop is somehow using MtGox or endorsing it, when actually you're just releasing a PHP plugin.EDIT : Also what do you mean exactly by "free" ? Yeah, that's what I thought  You can speculate as much as you want, even no additional information is disclosed  QFLulz Probably not, gold has a specific status in a lot of countries.Treating it like any random physical asset is probably the way to go for now. rpmHQfVUAVmCCYVqAm3c3WMnQAn86gq8Tj J'ai ri.Bienvenue ! QFT That's pretty much the whole point of the internet. Hey allThank you for all the offers we've received.Thing is, it seems like I underestimated the required budget. I was planning on around 20 BTC per wrapper.Looks like I was a little short here.I'll be developing the Ruby wrapper you'll find it here.Given the fact that this Ruby wrapper will work as a command-line tool too I feel it'll be much more cost-efficient for everyone to simply use it as a shell executable instead of developing wrappers for every possible language out there. Non, ce n'est pas le même compte.Le RIB pour Bitcoin-Central est au Crédit Mutuel Arkéa TL;DR  - The state now pays ~20% of your trading fees if you're a corporation.We're rolling out an interesting upgrade to the Bitcoin-Central.net and Paytunia.com services letting our users setup corporate accounts.The main advantage of a corporate account is that any European corporation will be able to claim a VAT refund for the fees it paid.We now issue monthly statements showing everything needed to properly account for the VAT claims.The statements are available as PDF downloads on each user's profile, if you wish to upgrade your account to corporate please open a support ticket.EDIT :  The trade fee already includes VAT, so if you claim VAT you'll end up paying ~0.4% instead of ~0.5%. I call built-in what's part of the standard library of a language. So to me it's built-in the languages I listed but not C++ or PHP for example, because these require an external library.But yes, I don't know of any language that will natively interpret a numeric string as a decimal type without explicitly telling it to. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.htmlhttp://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/bigdecimal/rdoc/BigDecimal.htmlhttp://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.htmlIf I follow you, languages shouldn't provide standard interfaces to do network I/O, because you know, that's computationally expensive and slow. I guess I won't follow you... That just means javascript doesn't support decimals, only floats.Using floats for display is fine in most cases, using floats for accounting is terribly wrong. The question isn't really about whether the language is good or not, I'm sure Perl is.It's about whether your module will be used a lot or not. I have yet to be convinced about Perl in this particular case High priorities are a PHP lib, a Java package, a Ruby gem. In this order. Are you a skilled developer in any of these languages ? You want to make some BTC ?Good! We have an assignment for you.The objective is to create API wrappers around the Paytunia/Bitcoin-Central API.The wrappers must be very simple to use,properly documented with whatever is good practice in the target language,packaged as a nice library,have its IP transferred to Paymium who will in turn fully open-source the code,implement the documented API calls,support HTTP Basic and OAuth2 authentication,feature a comprehensive test suite (again with whatever makes sense in the target language),callable directly from the command-lineUsing third-party libraries is encouraged as long as their license doesn't conflict with the final target license (MIT, GPL, AGPL or whatever makes sense).For example, for someone using the libraries it must be very easy to code a trading bot or a shopping cart interface.Payment in BTC or EUR bank wireIf your work is really good you can expect a job offer.Since there are quite a few languages we'll work the following way :If you're interested PM a preliminary offer including the price for the whole thing, we'll tell you if it works for us,if it does we'll create a repository for you to store the code,you'll then commit a working implementation containing a "view one trade order" demo API call (authenticating with HTTP Basic),we'll review the code, the associated documentation and tests,if we like it we give you the go for the whole thing We don't support INR anymore, your URL is correct though, it'll work for USD and GBP currently, but these are going to be discontinued shortly. We'll focus on EUR.
Some folks still don't get it apparently.Floats are represented with a sum of powers of 2, any integer can safely be represented in binary since 2^0 = 1.So for example 0.75 can be exactly represented in floating point representation as : 2^-1 * 2^-2But some other numbers can not be represented exactly in floating point format, no matter how much bits you use.Use a decimal type, it's internally represented by an integer times a negative power of ten.0.75 in decimal is represented as 75 * 10^-2.Any decimal number can be exactly represented this way. Probably just some other hack, move along folks. Aah, the joys of PHP and echo'ing SQL statements carefully crafted by hand  You'd act more like an exchange than a broker if I understand correctly.Also if you want to offer leveraged trading that means that you'll have to issue credit lines, right? Which in turn means, from my understanding, a massive regulatory framework ? Thinking about it it would fall into the broker category. So I guess you'd be a broker AND an exchange. Even though I'm not familiar with the US financial regulatory framework it does sound like a lot to handle.Well then, good luck! You have no idea how fast our logs fill Even if we wanted to keep them we simply wouldn't have enough disk space (we don't have that much of it anyway because all our servers have SSD hard-drives) Because some folks will pay for it even though it doesn't add much value compared to Instawallet.Wanting 0%-taint is stupid, if you want to mix coins you're after plausible deniability, not 0%-taint, I guess that's just marketing. Interesting.If it's purely for display purposes I'd say a float is an acceptable approximation. But of course it really depends on the specifics of your problem, what works for me might not work for you.You'd probably better in-depth advice if you gave a bit more context Use a decimal type of which you explicitly set the precision to whatever required. Don't confuse floats with decimals, they are completely different, a float is by definition an approximation, a decimal stores an exact value.Don't ever listen to anyone suggesting floating point for financial calculations, they don't know what they're doing, no matter how much precautions and care you take floats are and remain approximations that are not suited for monetary amounts.If you know the difference and know what you're doing there's really no need to use integers as storage type and handling type. Using an integer to store a decimal value in a high level language would show that you don't know exactly what you're doing.The reason MtGox will return integers in their API responses is because there is no way to discriminate between decimal and float types in JSON, they are represented the same way. Therefore, if your parsing lib parses these as floats instead of proper decimals you're boned. But if it parses them as integers you have an opportunity to post-process these as proper decimals before actually using them. Good to see that !Couple questions : - what are the implications in terms of US regulation of having a leveraged trading platform that trades an asset that's hardly legally defined ? - Will you guys need a blessing from the securities exchange commission ? Je n'ai jamais dit une chose pareille.Il est bien évident que quand un acteur économique profite du système ou en tire un avantage disproportionné ou inéquitable, c'est du côté du système qu'il faut regarder.L'état dans lequel se trouve cycliquement notre économie est lié au recours systématique au crédit, crédit qui n'est pas mauvais en soi, mais qui est pratiqué dans le cadre d'un système cassé (des entités commerciales ont le pouvoir de créer de la monnaie ex-nihilo et on ne laisse pas disparaître les acteurs ayant mal pricé leur risque) FTR it affects only older versions of Rails, if you have upgraded after the last CVE you are not affected. Non, ca ne l'est pas. Fixer un taux d'intérêt c'est évaluer un risque. Indépendamment du coût fixe lié à la gestion de l'octroi du prêt.Dans un marché parfait ca marche, les marges tendent vers zéro quand la concurrence et l'efficacité du marché augmentent. Les banques ont une double incitation : te proposer un taux bas pour que tu leur emprunte, mais pas trop bas pour ne pas qu'elles perdent d'argent si tu fais défaut.Pourquoi considère-t-on le business d'un assureur comme étant simple à comprendre alors que celui d'un banquier ne le serait pas ? Fondamentalement ces gens font le même métier, ils mettent un prix en face d'un risque.Sauf que dans les faits, et en particulier en France, le taux d'intérêt réel ne reflète pas vraiment le risque puisqu'il est difficile de se déclarer en faillite personnelle. La banque prend peu de risque par rapport au taux d'intérêt demandé.L'exemple de Bob ne tient pas vraiment, certes la banque a mangé une perte sur la dépréciation de la valeur de marché de son collatéral, ceci étant dit Bob perd également ses autres actifs, et pas seulement la maison, en se déclarant en faillite personnelle.Le système financier actuel a oublié les fondamentaux et ne laisse plus sa place aux équilibres de marché. Ou est l'incitation à l'efficacité quand on ne laisse pas les banques libres de faire faillite ? Que devient une gestion saine quand les profits sont privés et les pertes publiques ?Les banques profitent d'un avantage qui est l'énorme barrière à l'entrée dans ce marché et leur proximité du robinet de la création monétaire, elles ont l'opportunité de profiter des avantages de la planche à billets avant que l'inflation correspondante ne produise ses effets.Enfin bon, peu importe, si nous n'avions pas tous envie de voir un système financier équilibré ou l'efficience est récompensée par le profit et la mauvaise gestion par de vraies faillites, eh bien je pense que nous ne serions pas tous ici en train de discuter. What part are you having trouble with ? You seem to have a couple issues with the English language yourself.Thread title :Additionally it's "peddling", "pedaling" is another word.And finally, since when did a "forum environment" become a reference and example for proper English?Oh, and bonus points for not respecting typographic conventions when inserting a space before your question marks. this Newbies don't have reputation for the same reason you don't use eggs to make those delicious chicken mc nuggets. I'm loving them. One thing is for sure : this guy will cash you out. Can interest you in a pre-order ? I happen to have some lying around, have skype ? XD Can I interest you in some testnet Bitcoins ?
Import the keys you use into a blank wallet, you'll just need JSON-RPC I'm not sure of what you mean.If it doesn't work that way it's hardly Instawallet anymore, is it ?Theoretically I could test for every possible crawler and serve a search-engine specific page, put I don't like the idea of having some sort of massive "if search_engine" clause before serving each request. And in addition to not liking it, working on Instawallet's SEO is probably at the same priority level as fixing Bitcoinica's leaked source on my TODO. Alternative clients is for alternative Bitcoin clients, the MtGox app is simply a MtGox client  OP, if you have a problem with Instawallet, e-mail support@instawallet.orgExplain your issue and provide the factual information you have. It has lots of value in terms of traffic and positive image. You'd be surprised at how traffic we get on our other services coming from Instawallet by just putting four little links on the bottom of the page.You nailed it.Instawallet does not provide absolute taint removal. It however provides more plausible deniability than any paranoid Bitcoiner could ever need IMO. Alrighty. Thanks for the info.I was looking at various options to set up some sort of block explorer clone, having a built-in wallet would have been a plus but it's not that important.I wish bitcoinjs was maintained, looking into ABE too.Feel free if you have suggestions. Is it 100% open-source ? Or are there only parts of it freely available ?There's this repo : https://github.com/zootreeves/blockchain.infoBut I'm unsure of what exactly it contains and the license this code is released under. Looks legit. Why is this in alternative clients anyway? Slightly overkill for the OP if you ask me.While you're at it you might want to add that everything should be hosted in a nuclear bunker. On Mars. I met the author personally last week in Paris, cool guy, has lots of ideas.Regardless of whether this qualifies as press or not it's always good to share and encourage people that write about crypto-currencies in general and Bitcoin in particular. I don't really have a specific book in mind, but if I see one I'll be sure to update this thread.Part of the "growing pains" you mention is "growing", and growing takes time and patience I wish you luck ! I recall hearing 13 months in France. Chile I reckon. Well, e-books would qualify as books in my view.I guess what I'm trying to say is that if the OP is asking such general questions on an internet forum, it can mean that he simply is not ready to undertake the task of thoroughly securing his server.So my general advice would be that he document himself about the general principles, the different security layers, understand all the trade-offs and design choices that impact security and come back with a solid plan.The OP seems to have interesting ideas (on which I already commented) but a serious lack of experience. Lacking experience is allright as long as you know it and have the brains to think for yourself.Two general security principles :  - You can't have your cake and eat it too, there is *always* a trade-off between security and convenience, no exceptions. - Don't code security-related stuff yourself, someone has probably already done it, and done it better than you. Use libraries as much as possible, not fancy ones, but mature ones. Don't hand-escape SQL, don't hash passwords yourself, etc. You get the idea. You know, people write books about this subject. I suggest buying one. That sounds about right. Slightly dirty but I guess it would work.Maybe you can parse the debug.log as it's written to and check that the block index and wallet have been loaded. Maybe it's time to brush up grandpa. Keeping a decryption key on the same server that holds encrypted data is a bad security model. This is factual, you can't have your cake and eat it too, security is about tradeoffs, if you want security you have to give up some convenience.If someone tells you you can get a 7% weekly interest on your deposit he's probably a scammer. If someone tells you you can encrypt data in the DB but automatically decrypt it at will he doesn't understand security. Slam dunk case of security-by-obscurity.This is not about your little ego, it's about facts. What about transient objects ? (that exist in Rails, and in any framework that uses an ORM for the matter).What makes you think I don't know anything else than Rails ?Assuming OP is using a compiled language.Assuming it's not trivial to decompile any kind of language to extract constants or do a memory dump for anyone who has the slightest clue about what they are doing.Your security protects you against script-kiddies? Great! Now let's go back to real security that works with everyone.Making it slightly harder to get the keys doesn't make a flawed security model less flawed.
Exactement, en plus il me semble avoir fait hurler les sirènes quand bitcoin7 est arrivé Ce n'est pas une solution miracle certes, mais ca transfère le risque, si du jour au lendemain Paymium se fait poursuivre en justice, redresser fiscalement ou matraquer légalement, les fonds des utilisateurs ne sont pas touchés. That's actually terrible advice, that means you need to maintain your separate fork of bitcoin which will make it much less straightforward to apply patches and security fixes as they come. Choose a strong password for the RPC calls, listen only on the local interface and add some iptables rules on top of it just to be sure. MUCH more secure. If you keep the "send" calls disabling other calls is pointless. If you don't keep them you might as well run a wallet such as armory.If you have proper passphrases on the private keys it is a good idea.Don't reinvent the wheel, use a framework or a lib that does that for you.Good.No, because if someone can mess with the DB they can mess with the hash.If you really want to go down that road keep backups and run periodic data comparisons to see if historical data has been altered.Encryption is absolutely pointless if you keep the decryption keys on the server.That doesn't make sense at all, if you need to query on a column chances are the application needs to be able to decrypt it at will for display or other purposes, meaning you'd have to have the keys on the server which defeats the whole thing. I agree with Blazr here, there's probably high demand so if you want a boring job fixing bugs on hotel and flight reservation systems go for ASP.Net If it means the same fractional reserve requirements then I'll pass. The people on these forums have serious issues. Oh, and don't touch ASP.Net with 10-foot long pole. Ever. No exceptions. You'll end up with a boring job. Yes you did Absolutely.OP, start with PHP, but don't stick with it, learn Rails (or Django) removing the little wheels from your bike is scary at first, but you'll never look back. Instawallet and Bitcoin-Central remain unhacked and untrolled. Any further questions ? Yep, that's what I thought.You can not possibly be serious. No day is like another, and that's what I love about it.My advice is : Learn PHP, learn MySQL, learn Ruby on Rails, forget about PHP.Keep practicing Photoshop.Keep your mind open.Oh, and don't be a web developer, be an app creator. There's this hot topic in Europe right now about separating bank acitivites between "retail" and "investment" banking (advertised as legit vs. casino banking).There really is no difference between what you call retail and investment banking, banks are allowed, to a certain extent, to balance debt obligations from borrowers with monetary creation, effectively realizing the money-as-debt paradigm, the debt is money, therefore it is perfectly logical to create as much money as people are willing to borrow.Look at it the intuitive way, do you really think people collectively deposit enough money into banks for all the houses they collectively buy and borrow money for ? I have no desire to prove anything or convince you of anything.If you desire knowledge or proof you will find it.But I mean, simple question, what does "personal banking" even mean ? Like loans to private individuals ? I'm simply enquiring about the state of your previous project since you locked the relevant thread, that qualifies as mindful IMO.You can't just lock a thread and pretend it never happened. Well, it is. Oh hi!How is the fully-legit-bank-incorporated-in-a-country-can't-spell-the-name-of coming along ?Cheers! No @MatthewLMI think the work you're doing is awesome and I thank you for putting your skill and intelligence at work for the common good.  Might want to change the post title : "Instawallet support great success"   Antagonizing your bank over a withdrawal limit when you're not actually financially licensed in Europe. Smart. Have you emailed the support about it ?
You should have gotten a response, have you looked in your spam folder ?And no, nothing's been hacked, money moving from your address is normal, Instawallet is a shared wallet, you don't withdraw the same coins you put in. Awesome! So, open-source or not ?Didn't find any kind of source link on the website. Nice !Is it open source ? Getting these a lot too. I'm enjoying this thread. It's spelled "Sweden", or alternatively "Nigeria". That's interesting. But just FTR, keeping a list of members is already doing KYC. And yes, bitcointalk does feel much more responsive. I get none. InnoDB has lots of tuning options that can dramatically impact performance, especially the buffer pool size, but you probably already know that. You'll find a complete run-down of what is happening here, also if you sent an e-mail to the support you should have gotten a response by now. This message is being sent to the people impacted by the address-change issue : What will happen with wallets that got pruned a bit aggressively is that we won't be able to import the private keys and reinstate them, that is because for each import, bitcoind would trigger a full chain rescan. What will happen instead is one of the following, depending on what works best for you :Either we move the funds to another wallet with another address,or we give you the private key for the address so that you can keep using it as is We're having a few cases where the wallet was pruned where it should not have been.If you are in this case just e-mail the details to the support and we'll have it fixed today. Instawallet underwent a maintenance operation yesterday that completed this morning, for a number of technical reasons it took a long time to complete.The maintenance was successful and Instawallet should now be much faster.We apologize for not properly scheduling this maintenance, it however had to be done as the load on our servers was becoming too large and was leading to general unresponsiveness.Should you encounter any kind of issue do not hesitate to contact the support (support@instawallet.org) stating all relevant information and data (public wallet address, transaction IDs if relevant etc).The support does not need your private wallet URL and will *never* ask for it. FTR Rails 3.2.x series isn't affected. Il faut se déplacer, le cours que vous proposez n'est pas particulièrement intéressant, à moins d'avoir des certificats personne n'est sur de la qualité de l'argent, et le bitcoin monte en ce moment.Pas vraiment étonnant que ca ne se bouscule pas au portillon. But... I can't leave, you and your credit union are so adorable!Here, if you ever need to purchase ATMs for your customers to use. One could say so I guess.
 You have registered a corporation. Kudos. You win a potato and half an internet. Welcome back, massive kudos for the PP election, and drop by our office if you start looking for Bitcoin-related professional opportunities  Fuck yes. There is already a website made, chances are the graphic design is already there. None taken.Instawallet is extremely slow these days, almost to the point of being unusable. The number one reason is that the Bitcoin client is showing its limits. The wallet.dat has outgrown the blockchain data in terms of disk space usage. Now, in order to simply start up, the Bitcoin client takes an hour, an actual hour, just to load the wallet file. When creating a wallet it synchronously requests the creation of a new address from the Bitcoin client making the request block while the Bitcoin client is working, which takes a lot of time (between 5 to 10 seconds). Some sends very often timeout, that's why they're all handled asynchronously in a background queue now. Anyway, the problem is not Rails here, it's that I need to purge the wallet, keep only the active private keys and perhaps make more Bitcoin client calls asynchronous.Bitcoin-Central is another story, it needs a hardware beef-up and some performance-oriented refactorings (more caching, more asynchronicity all over the place, etc). But that's ok, Rails is all about refactoring your apps as they grow, that's what fat automated test suites are meant for.So it's really not about the framework, you can shoot yourself in the foot or write beautiful, maintainable and tested code in any language. Usually, the people who are the most vocal about Rails are those who wouldn't know how to "hello world" with it. This. FTR Bitcoin-Central.net, Instawallet.org, Instawire.org are built with Rails.Sucks though that the OP was simply looking for a developer and this thread turned into a my-penis-is-bigger-than-yours contest. Stop deluding yourself, you're not important, just extremely obnoxious. Nice job! Care to remind me which you operate ?Rails is awesome, deal with it. You'll need to read the "Pagination" section. You need to disable Google Authenticator in order to be able to authenticate against the API for the time being.A second authentication factor is useless from a security point of view if you can bypass it by hitting an API instead of a web interface.I'm looking into this issue as we speak, in the meantime the only way to use the API is to disable Google Authenticator. Are you sure you're curling it right ?Here's how I do it. Does it work that way for you ?Code:$ curl -X POST https://bitcoin-central.net/api/v1/trade_orders -d '{ "amount" : 1, "type" : "buy", "currency" : "EUR" }' -u 'david@bitcoin-central.net:***' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'{    "amount": 1.0,     "created_at": "2013-01-24T18:34:03+01:00",     "instructed_amount": 1.0,     "price": null,     "state": "pending_execution",     "type": "buy",     "updated_at": "2013-01-24T18:34:09+01:00",     "uuid": "d5455fae-0002-4046-a91b-83909b445a7a"}$ curl -X GET https://bitcoin-central.net/api/v1/trade_orders/d5455fae-0002-4046-a91b-83909b445a7a -u 'david@bitcoin-central.net:***' | python -mjson.tool{    "amount": 1.0,     "created_at": "2013-01-24T18:34:03+01:00",     "instructed_amount": 1.0,     "price": null,     "state": "insufficient_funds",     "type": "buy",     "updated_at": "2013-01-24T18:34:09+01:00",     "uuid": "d5455fae-0002-4046-a91b-83909b445a7a"} You'll need to unlock it from the web interface.Currently the only authentication mechanism is HTTP Basic, but that leaves out everyone using a second authentication factor.OAuth2 will be implemented shortly and should solve this problem as well as allowing a much better control over the API security. What makes you think you'd get a sound conscience by participating ? The new API is live.The remaining calls will now be progressively disabled now that the API v1 is deployed and documented.You'll find the documentation here : https://gist.github.com/4593591The online version of it will be updated shortly.

In Europe Bitcoins can be defined as virtual currency (I'm not even sure it has a legal definition), but they do not fall in the definition of electronic currency as electronic currency must represent a claim on the issuer expressed in fiat. Oh sorry, I forgot to also fix this other one for you.
Actually it looks like you're doing pretty well with just a spine. It depends on how your business relates to Bitcoin, and more importantly on whether you will store other people's money on their behalf.Again, it depends on your particular business. As with anything, telling the truth is usually the safest.Not really, I'd suggest picking a bank branch that's physically close. It always help to be able to just walk in. It actually makes sense   I wonder what the actual motivation is.Fixed that one for you. I beg your pardon. MFW Life is full of disappointments. I'm sure we can find much funnier. Bitcoin is not recognized as a currency.Therefore you never made a payment.Therefore you are not entitled to a refund.(oh and thanks for entertaining me while my test suites run)Has it ever occurred to you that people might find entertainment in feeding trolls ?I know there is really no point in throwing a stick for my labrador to fetch, there is really no productive value in it. Yet I do throw sticks. And I expect them to be fetched, for this has high entertainment value to me.  Maybe you should stick with PayPal   Let's invite this Micon guy in this thread and all leave at the same time. FTFY I lold. Vous nous avez viré sur notre ancien compte du CIC. Il faut maintenant utiliser notre compte du Crédit Mutuel Arkéa. Legal tender laws in the US = private debt can always be settled in USD. Vous avez eu une réponse il me semble.
You might want to get your facts straight.The judge telling the CIC to keep the account open was only before the court could actually settle the matter by hearing both side's argumentation, which basically went like this :CIC : We want to close their account because they're operating a business for which European and French regulations make a license mandatory.MTGOX : We don't need a license for keeping people's funds on deposit.JUDGE (to mtgox) : are you fucking kidding me ?The case had *nothing* to do with Bitcoin, it had to do with operating an unlicensed wannabe fiat bank, it would have been the same if mtgox was operating a trading platform for say... magic the gathering playing cards.And just because they managed to open a bank account in Poland doesn't make them compliant with European regulations, it's only a matter of time before that account gets closed, for the exact same reasons. They got bitchslapped by the judge for running an unlicensed financial business. You might want to give a little more details about your project, some people might already have built similar stuff, or building blocks might already be available.Why do you require it to be done in Ruby ? What do you need it for ? I think you used the magic words to summon mtgox's natalie.(A Japanese Natalie somehow always makes me think about http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8oytatiahQ) You're cute and all but I was talking about CC chargeback. I'm saying the promise of BitPay to merchants is to eliminate CC chargeback risks (by using an alternative payment system obviously).Of course you can accept BTC without BitPay, but not every internet merchant wants to know about Bitcoin, or understands it enough to feel comfortable accepting them themselves. Bitcoin-Central.net sera probablement le plus adapté. Convenience. It might not make sense to you, but it could make lots of sense for people who just want to sell stuff over the internet.Also you're taking the wrong perspective here, BitPay removes the risk of fraud, chargeback fraud, that's the promise. The idiots were. There are substantial amounts of idiots around these boards. You're comparing a language and a framework. Boo. I fail to see how it's news that accepting 0-confirmation is dangerous.Anyway, I'm interested in the specifics. Read the beginning of the thread ? yo Did you switch servers ? It's the truth. That's just scheduled maintenance We deployed the fixes within five minutes after receiving the notification from the Rails security mailing list. Tu peux donner un peu plus de détails ? Please see this thread for an important announcement regarding the API. Dear allToday I'm rolling out a new version of the Bitcoin-Central backend.It introduces heavy architectural changes to the way things work : - The precision of the trading engine is pushed to a full 8 decimal places - The execution of trade orders becomes asynchronous - The execution of outbound transfers becomes asynchronous - Bugs are fixed on the way depth is shown in the order book - E-mails are sent asynchronously, leading to better overall responsiveness - A private websocket over HTTPS user specific channel is deployed, allowing to listen for account events as they happen - A public websocket endpoint pushes the ticker updates as they happenUnfortunately, due to the deep nature of these changes it is not possible to keep the API as is (responding synchronously to calls).As a consequence, some calls (transfer money, place trade order) won't be usable until they are replaced with asynchronous versions.A new API will be progressively rolled-out, it should be much simpler to use and comprehend, it will be versioned, be OAuth2 compliant, and expose much less of our internal data model in order to be much more intuitive.Please in this thread to tell me which API calls are the highest priority for you. That would be https://bitcoin-central.net/order_book.json
If someone knows the HMAC secret and you're using cookie store someone can mess with the data in it, that's a feature.The vulnerabillity is that it could be used as a vector to exploit an SQL injection vulnerability (didn't read the details, just religiously applied the fixes).I recommend against using cookie store anyway and switch to Redis/Memcached/ActiveRecord for storing session data. Yea, pretty much all Rails apps will accept XML params by default.Both seem quite severe and I think everyone using Rails should just religiously apply the fixes (which are trivial btw)Apparently I made it sound like I didn't feel concerned about it, but that's not the case, Instawallet, Instawire and Bitcoin-Central were immediately patched when I received Aaron Patterson's e-mails through the Rails security mailing list (which I encourage every Rails developer around here to subscribe to). Send a postcard from the afterlife! I fail to see how terrible PR increases security in any way. You got it!  Data can still seriously be messed up with, and in subtle ways that won't make it look like something is wrong when you manually approve outgoing transfers.The source code your platform is based upon is stolen as everybody knows, the data model is pretty much public, and even if it has been altered since, SQL injections would let an attacker reverse-engineer it easily.So come up with a better answer, one that includes a pinch of humility and an answer as to whether the fix has been applied would do just fine <3 Avec un service de la qualité de Bitcoin-Central.net qui sert également de wallet, les français n'ont pas vraiment besoin d'avoir leur wallet standalone  find_by_* finders are fine. Also you're mixing up the two vulnerabilities.What are you even talking about here ? What ? Because the wallet is massive This one is CVE-2013-0155Only applications that accept XML parameters are vulnerable The main issues with the whole MtGox code thing is that MtGox is not financially licensed in any way I know of. It makes the taxation status of these codes unclear, it also requires us to come up with a reasonable and safe way to fit them in our accounting.The second issue is that we need to be 100% full-reserve, each user must have the same balance displayed by Bitcoin-Central as the EUR balance that's actually on his sub-account inside the Paymium account. That means that we'll actually need to front the money until mtgox pays us. There is obviously demand, rolling out the feature out is easy, (it's been in the code for weeks). Rolling out the feature properly is non-trivial  In the next deployed version it will. IBANs for accounts will be available when the technical project is complete on Aqoba's side, I'd say the ETA is a few months.Acceptance of MtGox codes is in the works, it might be only available for deposits though. I reported this one a while ago. The mobile app rounds sent amounts to six decimal places. I think it should be considered a serious issue because it can mess up a lot of use cases where sending an exact amount is important.(The Google docs thing is irrelevant, the reason it displays weird amounts is because it's internally handling floating point data types which are suited to represent approximations but not exact values.) Bonus points for putting it up on soundslice25 BTC for this one on soundslice : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Onjh6YjnSd8 This.It's unreasonable to assume that code is a sufficient spec. For someone with your background maybe. But for the rest of us probably not.A spec would allow for progressively fixing all inconsistencies such as the OpenSSL incorrect behaviour you mention by either documenting them as part of the protocol (and including this behavior in alternate implementations) OR by adding a consistency check at the Bitcoin level.Mike, simple question, what happens when OpenSSL fixes the buggy behavior?Bitcoin hitting 1.0 without a complete protocol spec would be a serious mistake IMHO.Oh and BTW, bugs happen, fuckups happen, it still beats the alternative of keeping all our eggs in one basket. You're arguing that financial software should be developed and tested carefully to which I agree. I find nothing in what you say that validates the "a specification document is a bad idea" point.So what ?You can't possibly be serious.That's a good idea obviously but it's not what's being argued here.I never said it would be easy, I never said anyone has to do anything about it, we're all scratching our own itches after all.I'm just saying we'd be better off with a complete spec, because it would decouple the protocol from its implementation.Just because something is hard doesn't make it less necessary.Here you're simply saying that the job is a hard one, but just because some folks have failed in the past doesn't mean it's not a necessary and useful thing to do. MtGox (and any shared wallet actually) should do exactly what we did with Instawallet and forbid dice addresses as recipients. For one that is true only if miners are to run alternative implementations. Secondly I find your statements a little FUDdy because even in the case of a chain split, most transactions would make it to both chains until it's resolved.Maybe documenting the protocol could lead to fixing said bugs at an agreed-upon block height leading to a clearer and more consistent protocol. I really don't see the harm in documenting what happens under the hood, bugs included.Maybe that's the sign that the specification-software is getting too convoluted, which will ultimately lead to unmaintainable poor quality software.What I want to see are competing implementations of a clearly defined protocol, not a centralized black-box maintained by a few who know exactly which bugs should be treated as features.Putting all your eggs in a single basket is never a good idea (especially when they're golden eggs), what happens the day a critical exploit is discovered in the reference implementation ? Does everything collapse ?Oh, and there's a reason why Bitcoin is still not 1.0 
I disagree with the folks that find tons of reasons not to document. I'm not really surprised though, this has come up a few times already and the answer was already pretty much along these lines.As much as I understand that the core contributors don't really feel like doing it for various reasons (they already write tests and contribute code after all), I'm really surprised that no one really seems to encourage MatthewLM to go forward with it.Yes, tests are good, but add a complete spec and it gets even better. Yes, it's a fact that the main implementation is currently both the specification and the implementation, nobody can argue that. However, arguing that it's a good thing, that it shouldn't change, that a full protocol documentation is unnecessary isn't quite the same thing IMHO. Which bank was it ?Are you located in the same country as the bank you want to open an account with ?Yes. They have no obligation to start a business relationship with you, neither do they have an obligation to motivate or discuss this fact.Worse, they are legally required to not discuss any suspicion of ML when they make a suspicions reports to their overseeing body.Yup.Find another bank, present the business under a different light that doesn't put all the focus on Bitcoin perhaps.To achieve what exactly ?Why would they lose their time if they have already made a decision. They have a business to run after all.Work harder, go knock on more doors.None. Because your definition of "sense" is not the same as theirs  Nous sommes en train de mettre à jour notre backend, en attendant que la mise à jour soit terminée les transactions sont validées par un humain.La mise à jour devrait être terminée d'ici 48h, les transactions seront de nouveau instantanées.Toutes nos excuses pour le désagrément. CVE-2012-5664 for the record We got yanked from the AppStore for using Bitcoin. Hahahah, oh yes please. I don't think so. Water is the answer. For the record I got offered to "rent" the domains, because apparently the .net and .com versions belong to the same person. http://bitcoin-otc.com I'd say use OTC These are not developed yet.I'm focusing on the account-specific channel right now.But the channels you mention will come. I'm extremely amused at this thread, did anyone actually check what happens if you type "bitcoin-central.com" in a browser? Yep, that's what I thought.And ashley, sorry for being rude, but when the thread started I still thought it was all about cyber-squatting, which is provably not, looking at the WHOIS. But you probably got that from my posts on page 1, unlike most of the haters in this thread for which actually reading a thread to get an educated opinion is probably asking too much. The socket.io interface is up and running, the documentation about it is a little outdated because I'm in the process of adding lots of stuff to it.When I'm done you'll be able to listen in realtime for pretty much any event impacting your account.If you have a specific question about it I'll happily answer. I mean if there was no rebrand in the pipeline, how would you have done that ? $1000 is unreasonable.$100 would already have seemed pricey to me. What would have seemed fair to me would have been your actual costs +50%, something like that.What would have happened after, someone offering bitcoin-central.io for $2000? What next, secure-bitcoin-central.net for $500? And then bticoin-central.net for $1500?Hah, no.That's pretty much the point of cyber-squatting, sell a domain to the brand owner with a nice profit.What sets you apart from a cyber-squatter though, is that apparently you owned the domain before I even started developing BC. So there was obviously no intent to cyber-squat. But that doesn't really matter since from my POV the result is the exact same. No name was stolen, a brand got built though, and AFAIK it was here first  Are you seriously assuming that you're the cause of the rebranding ?How would you have "held me over the coals" ?I'm saying $1000 is a rip-off (as in overpriced, not as in scam) when there's already a website and a brand that exist and that it can reasonably assumed that the use that will be made of it will be phishing. My words might have been a little strong, but I still consider that a form of cyber-squatting, which is perfectly legal, but not very respectable IMO.Nobody is implying that you're going to engage in phishing. What is being implied is that the new domain owner probably will, especially if he's willing to shell-out a grand to acquire the domain. Btw a full rebranding is underway, the name is going to change and all.If scamming happens it won't be for long. Lol yeahRegistration date is pretty early indeed yupFTFYAlso go fuck yourself.
No worries!With this solution you can mix some websocket magic to instantly push all balance updates to the browser.That's what Instawallet uses. I thought I read somewhere that the sale of virtual currency is prohibited by their terms. Use the monitortx patch instead, much better.  Yes, that's on the TODO, still hesitating between OAuth 1 and 2.We use these calls to register devices to push notifications using APN/C2DM to our Paytunia apps on Android/iOS.These calls are documented because the people developing the mobile apps needed a clear reference, regular developers shouldn't really use them, consider them undocumented  Yep, pick your phone up and give them a call Absolutely.Thanks! Don't hesitate to give feedback in the API thread. These points are moot since its extremely easy to protect your blockchain.info wallet with  a yubikey. oh. no. wait a second, the yubikey otp check is done in horribly wrong and broken ways and only checks the key id, not the actual otp.Replay attacks ? Go for it ! Instawallet's Bitcoin daemon apparently just crashed.Sit tight while it's starting up again. For the record, the Instawallet bitcoin client takes approximately an hour to start up. Yup, look at the very last API call description.Weird badum tsshh Of course. Life isn't about being as insensitive as possible and not giving any fucks about anything.But still, looking for freedom outside of yourself is delusion. If you're enslaved true freedom comes either from uncoditional and non-judgemental acceptance, or from freeing your mind from the fear of getting killed trying to escape. The reason for this is that true freedom doesn't come from outside yourself. I don't feel less free because gravity sticks my feet to the ground. Even though I'd really like to fly I don't think I'm fooling myself, or settling for a dumbed-down version of freedom, when I'm saying I'm free, even with my feet stuck to the ground Freedom is accepting reality as it is, exactly as it is without any kind of interpretation or judgement attached to it. Recognize ideas and concept, and be fully aware that they're just thoughts that sometimes stick to our egos.Who do you think is convinced of what exactly ?We all live with a different world around us, and there's always going to be something in the way. If I don't feel free because I can't keep as much of my own money as I'd wish, I might as well start to feel enslaved to the weather who is preventing me from motorbiking around bare-chested, I might as well start feeling enslaved to my kid who wakes me up at 7 am a saturday telling me its time to play or the neighbor's dog that prevents me from enjoying perfect silence or [insert something to complain about here] None of these are on our TODO.However, if you actually have a look for yourself and go visit our page on Bitcoin charts or have a look at the trading section in our full API docs you'll find that it's ok since we already offer both of these features.   You could use a pedicure Well, ask and you'll be answered.It's still a good indication, and a good incentive for the operator to have a zero-bullshit policy It will be executed atomically thanks to MySQL transactions now, and it will remain that way because I'm going to roll-out functionality that will queue everything and execute all jobs in an asynchronous fashion.We do as best as we can, and frankly, I think that being better at customer support is the best way to grow.I don't really like doing it, but it still makes me a little fuzzy inside when people give you nice words for helping them without them having to wait a week.We strive to do things right since 2010  Yup, I'm really interested in feedback from people that have this kind of professionnal background.Yes, that's how BC is designed to work, except for the IDs serving the purpose of timestamps. (and having the additional advantage of being absolutely unique unlike timestamps)Yep, absolutely, I don't really reason in terms of older or younger orders for that matter, I reason in terms of "which order is the one being executed, and which one is the order being executed against" but it has the exact same practical implications.Say you post a bid with a 10 EUR limit, no asks. Nothing happens during the execution.Someone else posts a bid @ 9.9 EUR, nothing happens since no matching orders are found during the execution.Someone comes along and posts an ask with a 9.5 EUR limit, that's the order that's being executed, it first executes against the first bid, the trade is settled at 10 EUR/BTC, if it isn't filled it will continue execution against the other order at 9.9 EUR/BTC.Now if it's still not filled it remains by itself in the order book.Now say someone posts a bid with a 11 EUR/BTC limit price, then it will execute at 9.5 EUR/BTC against the only remaining ask in the order book.If multiple orders are at the same price, the older ones get filled first.If it doesn't work that way then it is a bug.We don't offer this feature. The way I see it is that if you change your mind about your order size you lose your spot in the queue. The last published version of the TradeOrder class is 299 LOC long.The code that is responsible for automatically testing it, and preventing regressions is 924 LOC long.The code to test ratio is almost 3. Care was taken. And better, anyone can go check it out independently on github.Hope that answers your questions  It's not possible to change an order for a user, if you wish to do so you may cancel it and re-enter an other one.That's easily achieved by cancelling it and re-entering a new one.I'm not quite sure about what you're asking. Could you be more specific ?There are fees, these are public, and that's pretty much it.The source for Bitcoin-Central has been closed for a while now, but the trading engine code hasn't really changed, so anyone can go have a look for themselves on github When your primary key is an auto-incremented integer you have a clustered index, meaning that the data is stored on disk according to the order of the index, in this case it's the PK.So it's always going to be easier for MySQL to return data ordered on the ID. So, oldest orders will always show first in the list since their ID will always be smaller the newer orders. But it is true that even this behaviour is observed by experience, its not guaranteed by the RDBMS, so point taken, I'll add an explicit ID ordering I think I'll be fine, I spent countless hours fiddling with the InnoDB configs to tune much larger sites than Bitcoin-Central, and there's no way I'd give that kind of fun up :pAnd I don't write SQL anymore, I leave that to frameworks (well, I still keep an eye on the way transactions are handled and run everything with the SERIALIZABLE isolation level).I'm still hoping that at some point I'll have so much work that I'll have to call you  I don't really know about the specifics of your particular order, but we don't distribute the volume accross orders, oldest orders should get filled first.When we execute an order we get a collection of matching orders ordered by descending price, there is no actual constraint on the time the order was placed, but MySQL will still implicitly order on the primary key column which is an auto-incremented integer. In other words oldest orders should get matched first.Let me know if you want to have a look at the source  I think scrubbing unused accounts isn't a bad thing, especially with such low requirements as at least keeping a few satoshis in there.I don't know exactly how MPEx is built but I guess keeping a key in the GPG keyring is more expensive than just keeping a row in a database and that GPG doesn't scale as well as a RDMS when the keyring size increases. But hey, wild guesses here  Just wait for someone to tell Apple blockchain.info is a Bitcoin wallet that can send coins and not simply a "transaction viewer", it'll get pulled in the next ten minutes.
Yep, it sort of implies that the vulnerability of blockchain.info's users to a skilled admin comes as a surprise to anyone  Nuff said. why would we be ?that part is true IMO put it in your public folder, right click on the image to get the public URL and use that as source for the image you post.downside is that if you remove your image from dropbox it won't show anymore on your posts, upside is you have more control and less hassle where are you located ? dropbox is even simpler Populus. I always harvest panties myself. Same goes for math : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom I sure could but can't be bothered Fucking priceless  You're the living proof of the opposite  Oui, c'est juste qu'on a pas mal vendu et que du coup notre porte-monnaie "à chaud" était vide, il a fallu le re-remplir  It means the only freedom that there is to find is in one's mind.Real slavery is not appropriation of 100% of one's productivity.The real slaves are the people who are guided by their ego, their fear, their greed, their addictions, their thoughts and their delusions. Those who expect something else than what is right in front of them, those who fail to realize that everything is already here and that nothing exterior can truly free or enslave them.Look at the poor myrkul, he's enslaved to his idea of what ancap is, what it should be, what it should look like. He's so attached and married to this idea that he starts wasting his time responding in a thread that has the word "trollitics" in the first line. And now he might be raging a little, because I predicted that after ignoring me quite vocally, he'd go out of his way and click the infamous "show/hide" button, just because he's identified himself so hard to this idea and he wants to know what this stupid frenchman dares to say about it. Myrkul, also the game.Bottom line : freedom is subjective, it's not a percentage of whatever. 1. La monnaie virtuelle n'a aucune définition légale2. La BCE n'a aucun pouvoir de régulation, ni en Europe, ni en FranceUn site de poker en BTC uniquement ne pose aucun problème particulier du point de vue légal, il n'y a pas besoin d'une licence quelle qu'elle soit. lrn2freedom Humans are social animals. Deal with it. Corporations and governments are the same thing. The line you draw between them exists just in your mind. Massive corporations evolve into governments.AnCap has already happened, and it failed.Most people don't want to be free. My new book "Trollitics" is about to hit the shelves, let me treat you to the first chapter "We already live in an AnCap world".It's already being run by corporations that have their own private laws, their own private armies, their own private property.You just call them "governments".U mad ancaps?But seriously, u mad ancaps?
Avec du cash en main-propre.Localbitcoins.com Interesting suggestions from everyone :Favicon : yup, will be changed, actually there's a whole re-design in the works, it won't be based on bootstrap, it's going to be really good lookingOwn orders highlighted in order book : not really possible, orders shown are aggregated, ie. a single line can aggregate multiple different orders at the same priceAdding market info on trade page : I take!I want to make the automatic get-a-new-bitcoin-address-for-each-incoming-transaction feature opt-in. It scares the shit out of newbies. Better ? Word.We already do that baby. C'est normal, toutes les ventes passent par cet état. Sauf qu'en général on est plus rapide que vous et vous ne vous en rendez même pas compte  Maybe you can start one in the Service Discussion board with these interesting suggestions ! That's not available yet, it's a project that is in the pipeline on the bank's side, we have no precise ETA, but we know it should be rolled-out in a couple-of-months-ish. You must be new here. Next time I'll post a thread along the lines of "Bit-Coin acquires NYSE Euronext", we'll see who bites. Oh god.They accidentally the whole banking regulatory framework.  Hah, guess you'll remain stuck at 999 then. Don't you have some sort of mental disability benefits ? You seem to have confused Bitcoin-Central.net with InstaWire.orgThey're both operated by Paymium but they work very differently. - BC.net is a full-fledged exchange (and it's not limited to 100/day) - InstaWire.org is a place where you buy Bitcoins extremely easily by putting your Bitcoin address in the reference field without needing to create an account it's just a shell for a bank accountYep, try that, you'll sure get a straight answer  My interpretation is different. BC really has no way to know whether a deposit came from Instawallet or not.Bitcoin-Central and instawallet are different services. They have no direct connection and communicate to each other only through the Bitcoin network itself. In no way. Bitcoins are and remain unregulated. No reporting requirements are imposed upon Bitcoin-only services, and even if Instawallet is operated by Paymium it remains a Bitcoin-only service.We welcome Tor users on Instawallet.What we would do is pull the data we have from the Bitcoin-Central logs. We'd see a Bitcoin transaction incoming. And that would be it.We keep the strict minimum logs for Instawallet so there's really not much to share.If as a company we get a court order, we have to comply. However : - we can only give what we log, which is, again, not much for Instawallet, - it's quite dubious a court would issue an order to surrender Instawallet data "just to see if the transaction didn't originate from there"The beauty with Bitcoin is that you don't have to trust my word. Your financial privacy is in your very own hands, all the tools are yours to use. That's what she said Ah ben non, en effet on t'a pas répondu  T'es sur qu'on t'a pas répondu ?
Bottom line : if you really want to be that anonymous you wanna know exactly what you're doing, so you got to understand exactly how it all works. Read up  I personnally confirm 5828 BTC received from jgarzik. Ok champ, whatever, I shared my experience with the OP, he said it was helpful, so I'm happy about it. Have a good one. I've stated facts, shown you where to check them, yet so maybe you want to check your own tone before complaining that you can't have a "civilized adult conversation". No shit sherlock.Who said you had to hire expensive lawyers to solve problems? A telephone is a very powerful tool when used correctly.See the thread I linked in the first page. That's actual experience. It's in French but hey, it's 2012, so Google translate buddy. Well, read the thread  Your what? If you go through a bank your anonymity is lost. No exceptions. L'absence de preuve n'étant pas une preuve d'absence... Yup, that can happen with regular corporate accounts  They are required to *report* transactions if they believe the funds are of criminal origin, not return them. Quite the opposite in fact. lol, see what you did there piuk It didn't really sound like one, anyway the answers are here <3 Their technical reason is that they are the only ones keeping a copy of the AES key that's in the yubikey, regular yubikeys need the OTPs to be validated against yubico's service who keeps a copy of the AES key. I don't think it makes much sense but that's the technical reason they advertise. nope, well yes, but that's just because blockchain.info doesn't do the right thing and only checks the key id without actually validating the OTP meaning its vulnerable to replay attacks. boo I dealt with banks in both France and Latvia, and always had the same experience, they'll ask you if you're ok to reverse a transfer but they won't do it without your consent. We accepted most reversals because we correctly smellt something fishy going on and locked the funds, but in one case where there was fraud we had to refuse the reversal because that would have resulted in a net loss for us (and no we didn't feel really good about that, but after all, phishing fraud is the bank's problem for having insecure systems in the first place)  Thing is, you can use this attitude and be nice at the same time, just be consistent."Okay, you'll look into it ? No worries at all, take your time, you understand my problem. You call me back in a week ? No problem". And a week later you call back because they won't. You don't have to be belligerant at all. When people feel you won't let it go they'll get up their asses, just to be left alone  Bitcoin-Central : 2 confirmations.Instawallet : 2 confirmations.Never a single Bitcoin lost.Have fun waiting for your Bitcoins on MtGox, on Bitcoin-Central they'd already be on their way to your bank account.
You should have fought harder, they have no right to return a bank transfer without your explicit agreement. We had the exact same problem a few months ago. What happened is that the bank account we used at the time got blacklisted by the Crédit Agricole bank. As a consequence, our customers could simply not wire money anymore to us, this thread followed the issue.That was a retarded situation. But we won and got it unlocked unconditionnally (as I said in thursday's announcement lots of the work we do is unseen).My advice is the following : Leverage all the contacts you have there, we reported some phished bank accounts to the Crédit Agricole before getting blocked, so we had a couple phone numbers. Call these contacts, every day, I repeat every fucking day, don't let go of them, escalate the issue and talk to the boss, talk to the boss's boss. Be polite, explain politely that it's not acceptable, explain politely that you are losing business because of them, insist heavily on this fact. Insist that this absolutely not acceptable, that the issue is on their side, not yours. Remind them of how you helped them improve their security (in our case we reminded them of the money that didn't get stolen thanks to our phished accounts reports). A bank gives no shit whatsoever, but individual contacts will be embarassed, use this, insist, call again, and again, and again. Don't threaten them directly, but make it clear that it is not going to be tolerated, that a solution has to be found. That a bank can not simply shut a legitimate business down by cutting its funding. Use the embarassment of the individuals you'll have on the phone. Call again and again. If they say they're going to get back to you ask them when, and if they don't call back you call them.Be patient, you'll win. It took us a full month, but we won.Yeah, and trust me, we know our shit. They don't have to. The same way MasterCard wasn't aware of the BitInstant debit card, they're the technical providers.Aqoba is a financially licensed entity that is contractually linked to a bank in order to use its technical infrastructure, Aqoba has sole authority to choose with which clients it wishes to do business.  the haters are too busy hating i guess  Help yourself to creating one if you don't like this one That's a quite dubious claim none, pretty much the same way no one *has* to do business with you or me Heh. Good thing Paymium is not a democracy  C'est la même société mais ce n'est pas le même site, instawire.org est un site de change à taux fixe, nous vous vendons les bitcoins.bitcoin-central.net est une place de marché libre, vous échangez avec d'autres utilisateurs.Sur bitcoin-central.net vous pourrez en général acheter vos BTC un peu moins cher que sur instawire, mais instawire est plus simple d'utilisation. Je désire payer beaucoup d'impôts, parce que si je paye beaucoup d'impôts ça veut dire que je gagne beaucoup d'argent. True, I made mine, have fun, make yours Yup  Permission was neither asked, nor granted.There's really nothing to allow or forbid about Bitcoin.There are, however, quite a few rules to handling fiat currency on behalf of third parties without getting in trouble. It actually is true that the smaller the amount, the more worked up people get. Just as much as Satoshi paved the way for Bitcoin regulation by inventing Bitcoin. Goeie poep :3 This reasoning makes no sense if what you want is a sustainable business. Oh god, please stop with this regulating Bitcoin nonsense. No thank you, I had my share for today.
No, her points are retarded.She (He?) is completely off the bat when speaking about regulating Bitcoin, no one ever said anything about regulating Bitcoin. I'll go in a little more depth later about our interactions with regulatory bodies, but basically we neither asked permission, nor sought regulation for Bitcoin.Fiat is regulated : fact.Bitcoin is not : fact.Bitcoin exchanges are by definition an interface between these worlds, so I fail to see how it comes as a big surprise to anyone that in order to be sustainable in this business an exchange has to be licensed for the fiat-handling part.A gummy bears/EUR exchange would probably have had the exact same problems, but probably less stupid fanatics and fanboys running around screaming and calling us heretics to The Cause. Maybe not everyone wants to be their own bank... FTFY  Where are these 16 years old everyone's speaking of ?  Source ? No but you'll fail since you'll be economically inefficient compared to people who do. Thank you! I'll confess a slight bias, I'll watch with the other reactions with interest  No that was Erik's comment on Stuckey's article.You should go read it, make your own opinion about it, I had a good laugh.Also Erik, your article just nails it. Please excuse my naive question (and excuse me if it comes off as offensive, no offense intended), I'm not really into mining anymore and have only followed these ASIC-related developments from a distance, but has this BFL company ever delivered anything to anyone ? Jon, please stop now You know perfectly well that this is not going to happen since the state knows that this would mean instant, free and massive publicity for Bitcoin. Apple and oranges Jon, apples and oranges. Buying Bitcoins through blockchain.info, 6$Posting on the forums accusing a respected service of scamming you out of the price of a sandwich, freeMaking a fool out of yourself, priceless. Instawallet.org like-never-before Necroposting = not cool. Jon, what makes you think I feel one way or another.I'm merely commenting on your article, which points I feel are not of the outsanding quality we're all used to.As for my feelings I actually feel really good about about all this! I feel really good about the support an important share of bitcoiners are showing, I feel good about arguing with the skeptics and I feel awesome about ignoring the haters.I'm sure you can find a couple, that doesn't make my point less valid, especially in the context of a regulated financial entity.Which would be ? No, the truth is, I just live there, not much choice involved You got it !I wholeheartedly agree with you here.If someone tries to get any Instawallet user-data from us we'll greet him with a nice warm cup of back-the-hell-off.Sure you won't have have regulatory or identification issues if you trade on exchange trades Bitcoins against Bitcoins, or gummy-bears for the matter. Things get slightly more complicated as soon as you involve their copy-pastable currency.On a sidenote I'm really curious to see what the Bitcoin foundation has to say about all this, after all this really helps the third point of the foundation's mission statement "Promoting Bitcoin" by making it less scary from a legal point of view to all the businesses who wish to accept them. Maybe thanks to this move we'll score Wikipedia's business, who knows.Talk about it on your next board meeting and let us all know And please accept this so called "internet bro-fist" as a token of appreciation for all the outstanding work you've done for this community and the gentleman argument I'm currently enjoying with you. Irrelevant. Code stolen is still stolen, no matter how many commits you layer on top of it.Why not restart something from scratch with all the experience you gained developing BitFinex ?Bitcoinica was developed in 4 days according to ZT, shouldn't be *that* hard.But hey, you did a good job transforming the demonstrable pile of shit Bitcoinica's source was into a supposedly legitimate meta-exchange I'd still rather look unoriginal than ugly <3Also saying "twitter bootstrap" design is like saying two websites have the same design because they're... websites.Anyway, I was just pointing out my own personal feeling. The good part remains, you appear to actually have a clue about what you're doing, not that I'd touch BitFinex with 10 foot long pole, don't get me wrong, but you seem to be actually be concerned about making your platform into something worthy, and I can only support that. And I'd support it even more if you started fresh. I mean if someone steals Bitcoinica's source, *at least* don't destroy the design it had, I found it quite pretty Sorry, still ugly  If you trade rubber bands on a the open market you'll probably be required to identify yourself.Regardless, if it offends you, you always have the option to pass. So I'm not sure what exactly is offensive here, that we ask *you* to provide identification ? Because we don't. Or that we offer a service that requires some level of identification ?With this move we also offer to any of our users to option to opt-out without providing identification of any kind and get a full, unconditional refund. I really don't see how we could do much better.Unlike certain exchanges I won't name, we won't lock your funds if you don't identify, we'll refund you. And that's exactly what's stated by KYC regulations : "if the financial entity fails to identify its customer it must sever the commercial relationship and return already sent funds to where they came from". Plain, simple, free and based on voluntary agreement.I'll beg to politely differ. Liquidity would be really worse than what it is today if exchanges weren't integrating with the current financial system, regardless of licensing and regulatory issues. Word.I'll leave you guys and go back to casually hanging around in #mtgox on IRC 
I guess the delay isn't as bad as the nagging. Leuk !Eindelijk iets in Nederlands, Sinterklaas is een beetje laat  No chargebacks ? 100% sure ?We've heard this one before But this is quite interesting. You might want to give Bitcoin-Central a try. Any Apple fanboy would also tell you that your bookmarks are synced with iCloud  We're going to work with Aqoba to do as much as is legally possible. Just because some French banks make it hard does not necessarily mean it legally isn't feasible to open accounts for foreigners. That is one thing. The other thing is that requirements are different for bank accounts ("comptes de dépôt") and payment accounts ("comptes de paiement").I honestly don't know what exactly is possible and what isn't. We'll be working with Aqoba, our lawyers and their lawyers to figure out exactly what is possible and what isn't. There is already one thing that is 100% sure : any resident, or corporation from a SEPA-zone country is able to open an account with us.We honestly didn't think there would be this kind of massive interest from Americans and other nationalities all around the world.The exact type of license we'll have for this is "IOBSP" ("Intermédiaire en Opérations de Banque et Services de Paiement"), Aqoba has an EP ("Établissement de Paiement") license (PSP).You seem to be slightly confused here, one of the main points of this move is to allow our customers to trust us less. By this, I mean that the customer funds are safe, deposited in their own name (the customer's name), clearly segregated from our corporate funds. These funds are legally not our property. I can only let you imagine the catastrophic consequences of an unlicensed exchange being sued to bankruptcy by a state, a bank or some other party. If such a thing was to happen to us, all our clients would be safe to the very last cent.The guarantee of the French government doesn't cover our own bankruptcy (as it wouldn't be needed since as I outlined, our funds are legally separated from our customers funds), it covers our customers against a default of the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa which is the backing financial institution. For an unlicensed exchange this guarantee is 100k globally for the comined customers balances, for us, the guarantee is 100k per customer. Haha, smart! Finally, someone speaking some sense.Bitcoin is a vibrant ecosystem with lots of possibilities, lots of options. Localbitcoins by Jeremias Kangas is the first that comes to mind.Bitcoin is not about doing thing one way or another, Bitcoin is about giving people choice to do things the way they wish. I haven't really criticized the foundation as being "more regulation", that would have shown a quite weak understanding of Bitcoin.My opinion on the foundation overally is "Good thing for Gavin, he gets a salary, he deserves it after all. Also meh."I'm however eagerly awaiting to see how the foundation will cover this as it, IMHO, undoubtly deserves at least as much attention as "the banks dirty secrets" I'm not even arguing his opinion is right or wrong, we all know there is no such thing as the Absolute Truth. But I do point out that he's kinda making big deals about stuff that's really not the main point of this news "will we be able to remain anonymous using BC ?", well, you're not anonymous on any exchange as soon as banks get involved. The way he talks about graph analysis forgets all we learnt with Shamir's paper.His statements about how Linux didn't start by integrating with Microsoft are laughable as someone pointed out on Reddit : "Linux did coexist in a sense with Solaris, HP-UX, and other proprietary UNIX(r) OSes, which is the market in which Linux eventually came to dominate."Anyway, let's not waste our time here, I respect his opinion but I think he could've made a much better article out of it.It does matter, because if you act like you're regulated without actually being you only get the negative side and reap no benefits out of it. MtGox was doing AML/KYC when they got kicked out of France, they got the bad side of regulation and still got everyone angry by suspending their EUR business for a while. They neither had nor ate their cake. That's yet to be confirmed by a mtgox representative. You're right, statement removed. This article is a massive pile of fail.My reply Means of payment is legally defined in the EU, not means of exchange.These people pull things out of their asses, it's what they do. And by that I mean : sub. That's sounds awesome. Right Done, changed "as" to "with". Well, MtGox got kicked out of France with the CIC v. MACARAJA case in which it was argued that MACARAJA (the French company representing TIBANNE, the company behind mtgox) needed a license to operate a service where fiat was held on behalf of third-parties. That's all I know.They then had an account in the UK at Barclays, which got closed by the bank a couple of months ago, and they now have an account in Poland which as of today is apparently still up and running.Moving bank accounts periodically can also be a strategy. That's the spirit ! I don't know, am I ?Just because you sit down when you pee doesn't make you a woman.I don't know, use your own common sense, do you think any company can, without any sort of license whatsoever engage in the business of banking (collecting fiat deposits and storing them on behalf of third-parties) ?But hey, what's not legal is not necessarily immoral. The opposite is true, during WWII is was legal to kill Jews because they were Jews, does that make it moral ?
It's the week-end so a press-release from Aqoba will have to wait until next week.Don't count on Credit Mutuel Arkéa to say anything though. FYI SEPA transfers are necessarily in EUR.But if you have a EUR account or can make one easily then yes you can make SEPA transfers, in which case I recommend Bitcoin-Central.net That's really interesting !The can of worms is slowly opening  Dear all,There's been an overwhelming response to our announcement.Unfortunately there seems to be a misunderstanding in the head of some journalist that basically quoted thatThis is of course factually incorrect :Neither Bitcoin-Central nor Paymium got a PSP license, we partnered with one, which costs less but has the same result.No-one became a bank, obviously becoming a bank has unbelievable overhead and requires millions and millions in capital.If France actually regulated Bitcoin itself it would be an even bigger day for Bitcoin, whether good or bad I'm unsure, but still much bigger than this announcement.We have published what could be called a press-release here.The fact remains that we're setting the MASSIVE precedent of operating a Bitcoin exchange within the current regulatory framework. We're setting a precedent where operating a Bitcoin exchange can be done in broad daylight.And yes it's risky, as I was told :FUCK YES, I SENSE SHARK FEAR AND FELT LIKE SOUP ANYWAY.EDIT : And to all the people that are scared, the reason you're scared is probably because you do not fully understand that Bitcoin doesn't care whether it is regulated, it doesn't care how you use it. It's math, and math does not care. Have more faith or learn math, everything's gonna be allright. Sucks that their headline is a massive factual error. Non.Bitcoin-Central.net est une plateforme d'échange opérée par Paymium.Paymium a conclu un partenariat avec la société Aqoba afin que cette dernière lui fournisse un service de tenue de compte en Euros. La tenue de compte en Euros veut dire que les comptes utilisateurs de Bitcoin-Central.net sont liés à des comptes de paiement au sens de la directive Européenne sur les services de paiement. Ces comptes de paiement sont tenus par Aqoba, les fonds sont déposés au Crédit Mutuel Arkéa (à ne pas confondre avec le Crédit mutuel).Le Crédit Mutuel Arkéa est une banque au sens communément admis du termeAqoba est un établissement de paiement au sens de la directive Européenne sur les services de paiementPaymium est une société par actions simplifiée (SAS)Donc non, Bitcoin-Central n'est pas une banque, en revanche, et via son partenariat avec Aqoba, Paymium peut ouvrir des comptes de paiement pour le compte de tiers. Paymium n'a pas de partenariat direct avec le Crédit Mutuel Arkéa. It was what made Instawallet absolutely unusably slow in the beginning of 2012.I used to use it for Bitcoin-Central as a second layer of accounting, but at some point I realized discrepancies, which were due to the silent rounding.Anyway, I don't mind this feature, but I think it's going to be really great when bitcoind uses a relational database that you can query directly. Word. Really? Judging by Google Maps Tokyo's coordinates are 35° 41′22.22″N 139°41′30.12″E﻿, I would have guessed it was Japan based. We already have this feature, it's only available through undocumented API calls yet but the brand new Paytunia iOS app will take advantage of this to transparently funnel EUR through the Bitcoin network. More to come on this in a little while We're going through our backlog (the news brought a *massive* influx of new registrations). But unless your account was explicitly flagged for KYC you can start using it right now. A financial institution has a duty to ensure the origin of funds deposited with it. Care to repeat that ? You know, it's just the beginning  mtgox could open an account with us, but not to store their user's funds. to store their own funds would be OK. We thought about this one, thought about making it a standalone service, however days are only 24h long, so it'll have to wait a tiny little bit. What do you mean exactly ? Haha, it's not the end of the world.It's the end of *a* world. I hear you and that makes sense, I guess we'll find out. Please, go be stupid somewhere else. We're operating since 2010, but thanks for the insight.
Thanks! I can already tell you that there is more to come in the next couple of days  Nice!Will probably be better than stare contests and rock-paper-scissors to solve disputes. We never said we were a bank, we said that we're allowed to do a good part of what a bank does.We're the first to actually be allowed to hold fiat on behalf of third-parties, if it sounds like marketing talk to you maybe you should re-read the threads about MtGox v. CIC.Interfacing properly the current financial system in a solid way has value to me. Giving businesses wishing to accept Bitcoin the opportunity to partner with a regulated entity has value to me.Offering a service where users get both their own IBAN and Bitcoin address within the context of a Bitcoin-aware regulated institution has value to me.If you don't see value here too bad, just don't use us. We're an option, not an obligation. We won't force anyone. We won't try to bash our European competition using this.We offer. You take, you don't take. Your call.No, doing your homework is sufficient. Go do yours, read about this legal case that was settled in France in 2011. All the info is here.Then come back and we'll talk Thank you !We respect all opinions, but as stated in the OP, we'll have to agree to disagree.Peace. As you probably guessed these markets will have to be dropped.It's not impossible that in the future we can offer the same services in GBP through Aqoba, but right it's not the case.It's not really a problem, we're preparing another really good announcement about how we're going to service the US and UK within our regulation framework.Yes, absolutely.You are correct. Hahaha oh godThey can regulate BC (not the ECB though), good luck regulating math  Beat them at their own game, that's the way I roll.Also if they want to lock your Bitcoins they have to define them legally first : no matter the way you look at it Bitcoin wins. ASAPOui, on s'en servira pour faire bouillir notre marmite.Ça dépend plus de nos partenaires financiers que de nous.Trader sur Bitcoin-Central ne coûtera pas plus cher. Il est même possible que le boost de volume que cette annonce devrait nous apporter nous permette de baisser nos prix.Edit from grondilu:  édité par erreur, puis rétabli.  J'espère que c'est ok maintenant.  Désolé You're happily forgiven.I'd love it too!I hear you, it's perfectly possible that things go down that way. But hey, there's only one way to find out.And even if it went that way there would still be another side to the coin, what I see on that other side is massive buzz and raised awareness about Bitcoin.So even if we go down the drain it will have been useful. You may ask.No, right now there is no document that we can publish. However we put all the required legal mentions in the footer of the website.Additionnally you'll be able to see that our EUR bank account information is consistent with what we say when we tell you the funds will be held by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa.There should be a joint press release with Aqoba pretty soon which will then be visible here. Once again, we are not subjected to US regulations. You confuse Paysius with Paymium.As the French saying goes : "who tries nothing gets nothing".Also quoted, let's check back in two months. I don't really see why this would fail, there's business to be made by everyone, re-read all that has been posted about the MACARAJA v. CIC case. The judges had absolutely no problem with Bitcoin, they had a problem with Karpeles arguing that he did not need any license to do what he did.We did our homework, you can never control everything, but we did what we had to.Go tell that to all the people that want to get some Bitcoin.Go tell that to all the merchants that want to be able to accept Bitcoin without their accountant getting a heart-attack.Go make the same stupid comment to the people that are sick of Western Union fees and who just want to send some money to their family.Of course we need more people to accept Bitcoin and trade it directly for goods and services, but that doesn't mean we don't need a healthier exchange ecosystem with established and solid foundations.If you do not need such a service than you are free not to use it. If it's as you say it is indeed a bug that needs to be fixed.If I was you I would simply not use the accounting feature.It just doesn't scale well. To be precise we partnered with a licensed PSP in such a way that we are allowed to do most of what banks do. Abuse will happen, our job will be to adapt. Policies are never set in stone and need to adapt to the evolution of threats.Requiring an ID is already a KYC policy.As per our ToS we may require additionnal documentation from users if the need arises.It is never nice to be in the position of having to submit additional documentation but it can happen.Promising never to do it would be a lie. We can not promise that.What we can promise is that we'll do our f**ing best for everyone to have to most pleasant experience possible.Maybe one day we won't be needed anymore, maybe one day fiat will belong in museums. Maybe one day these regulations will be gone.But that's something that we can only collectively make happen. And I feel that, today, we made a step in the right direction. We're going towards a dual debit card, with EUR and BTC balances spendable.Depositing MtGox codes is on our roadmap, (it's also technically developed) but we haven't rolled it out yet. We need to figure out the proper way to accept them without relying too much on MtGox. We would be in deep sh*t if we were holding a massive balance at MtGox and it suddenly went under. We will do it, but we will do it the right way, probably something along the lines of "Paymium takes the risk of a MtGox default by actually buying your code for EUR/USD when you deposit it". You see the problem ? You're doing a "move" which is not the same thing as a "sendtoaddress".Again, last time I checked transaction fees could not lead a non-default account into negative.I'm not saying it has not changed, I am giving you the result of my experience.Last time I checked "move"s between accounts would silently round the amounts to two decimal places, but it has been fixed since then.The only way to know for sure is to test on the latest versions  Thank you <3We partnered with Aqoba who has been a PSP for a couple of years.PSPs are allowed to hold fiat currency on behalf of third-parties and offer payment services, it's exactly what a bank does, minus the issuing of credit.No, Bitcoin balances are not insured, we, as a company are responsible for the BTC deposited, but there is no insurance company backing it.But we do use cold-storage massively and extreme security paranoia.It is a fiat that is insured. If someone tells you the BTCs balances are insured that should probably raise your suspicion.US citizens can open an account with us, no problem, but as of today this announcement only covers EUR balances (which are 99.9% of our business anyway).We said "licensed to operate as a bank" which we mean as "open accounts to third-parties and hold fiat currency on their behalf in compliance with the regulatory framework".We don't have transfer limits. The only limits are for security purposes only and can be adjusted at will by contacting our support.Our certificate is perfectly valid.Taxpayers don't cover losses, they cover your fiat balance should the Credit Mutuel go under.We investigate these kinds of solutions, but haven't found the perfect one yet. But I do agree that it would be easier for everyone and help reduce our security costs.We are not subjected to US regulations, and French/European regulations do not make provisions regarding US citizens. So on our end we're fine.US citizens need to check whether they need to declare something to the IRS or some similar authority.To be completely honest there is going to be a learning curve on our end too, we are new in this field and Aqoba is new to Bitcoin, so some cases we did not plan for will have to get straightened out as they occur.Yes, as soon as our cards program is ready we will have no problem with that.Yes, when this functionality is rolled out (in a couple of months) everyone will get their very own IBAN (no more pasting account references in random bank wire fields, yay!)Internet banking will be on Bitcoin-Central.netSure! david(at)bitcoin-central.netWe're really blown away by the positive reactions (me, and everyone at Paymium). Nothing else comes to mind than : "Thank you guys!" Vous pouvez prouver au fisc que vous contrôlez une adresse munie d'un solde positif en signant un message avec la clef privée correspondant à l'adresse. We won't have limitations regarding the citizenship of our clients. Bienvenue à toi !
Lots of the work that we do is unseen. At Paymium we spent lots of time and energy talking about Bitcoin to our regulating bodies, the Banque de France, the ACP (French equivalent of the American SEC), TRACFIN (AML French supervising body) etc. We engaged all these resources with one goal in mind : get these people to know Bitcoin, advocate our beloved crypto-currency and listen to them, help them think until they finally reach the same conclusion as we did : there's nothing wrong with people being free.There's nothing wrong with people freely exchanging value, we don't hurt anybody, we're not forcing anyone to use Bitcoin, we simply want to see our dream and the future of money become a reality.After all this patient work and lobbying we're finally happy and proud to announce that Bitcoin-Central.net becomes today the first Bitcoin exchange operating within the framework of European regulations. Since 2010 we kept learning, when mtgox got kicked out of France for not complying with the law we learnt from it, when our banks gave us a hard time we learnt from it, when we discussed with smart people on these very forums we learnt from it.From monitoring the regulatory field we learned that TRACFIN knew about Bitcoin, that the ECB knew about Bitcoin. And that they were both worried.So we felt that if no one went there, and told these people about Bitcoin, they would come to us anyway.We're therefore extremely proud and happy to announce that Bitcoin-Central.net will be raising the bar for all the other exchanges, at least the ones operating in Europe.We're announcing today that Bitcoin-Central.net is getting, through a partnership with Aqoba, allowed to operate like a bank, (or more precisely like a PSP which is basically the same as a bank, just without the debt-money issuing part).Some people might argue that regulation is a bad thing. We respect this opinion, but we'll have to agree to disagree.But this is not only some regulatory detail, it has dramatic implications for us, our users, and... our competition Let's go over a couple of them:Our user's funds will actually be held at Aqoba's partner financial institution under the user's name, they will be separate from Paymium's funds (on the other hand, all of other exchanges funds for example sit in the same account, and are considered by their bank to be their corporate property)Our user's accounts will be protected by the "Garantie des dépôts" which is the French equivalent of the American FDIC (the insurance cap applies to each account individually, and not to the sum of all user balances, so unless your EUR balance exceeds 100kEUR your fiat is 100% insured by the French taxpayer)Each account will in a few months get its very own IBAN number, users will be able to use it as any other bank account, have their salaries and pensions sent there and have them automatically converted to Bitcoin if they so wish)Each user will soon be able to order its own debit card that will use their EUR and BTC balance to honor purchases and cash withdrawalsWe'll have direct access to the banking networks which will let us 100% automate all incoming and outgoing transfersCorporations will have an actual financial institution talking with them if they wish to start accepting Bitcoin and be safe from a regulatory point of viewPaymium will have a much better legal standing and a much higher attractivity for second and third-round investorsPaymium will be in a much better position to make its vision become true : make all our transactions, be they denominated in crypto or fiat currency, flow through the pipes of the Bitcoin networkBUT, that doesn't mean more hassle for our users, since we know exactly what is legally required we can already tell them that a simple ID will remain sufficient to fully verify an account.It's a big day for me and Paymium, and it's a major milestone for this community. It was written exactly as intended, but thanks  Ca met entre 24h et 48h à arriver. HOE HOE HOE Well, I don't argue that, I'm arguing that they aren't compliant with the European regulations. I'm also arguing that you seem quite clueless about said regulations.Hopefully you won't complain when their bank wakes up, freezes their account and makes it extremely hard for everyone to withdraw their fiat-denominated funds. Fixed surely spending a couple of hours transcribing one has a much better ROI  Just a small precision, you'll need the Scanbook app in order to send from your Instawallet by scanning QR codes. It's being taken care of. I'm on it. Most regulations are now at the European level. Last time I tried it did not work that way, but maybe you're trying with the default account, which is allowed to go negatvie. No, the transaction will fail if a tx fee causes the account to go negative I emphasized the facts you need to get straight. You made your point, now do you have alternative wallets to suggest to the OP ? Where are you guys incorporated ?The "About us" page has lots of marketing talk, but not much actual information.Also 20 EUR for SEPA wires is quite steep.Oh, and don't cross-post. The difference isn't as fundamental as you might think, see here. Comment there if you want, let's keep this thread on topic. Instawallet will work beautifully on iPhones, and it will even take advantage of the Passbook app so you can have easy and instant access to your Instawallet's QR code. He speaks sense to me. You need to get your fact straights.

Comparing Atlas ranting with questioning some retarded ban made on dubious pretenses => apples and oranges if shrödinger could read this he would be in a superposition of laughing and crying statesother than that I think this ban was/is retarded I like Le Monde. Pas de problème, la prudence est saine! Pour info c'est moi qui ai crée ce service, au sein de Paymium, donc ce n'est peut-être pas moi qui serai le plus objectif Ma remarque reste vraie en ce qui concerne les sociétés françaises, c'est quand même plus facile de se retourner contre une entité située dans le même pays s'il devait y avoir un problème.L'idée à la base était de ne pas se les faire indexer, mais bon, au fond ca n'a pas d'importance.Limiter les opportunités de fraude (utilisation de comptes phishés par exemple) et ciblage des débutants, pour le KYC allégé. Pour les montants plus important on redirige les clients sur Bitcoin-Central.Non pas vraiment.Pourquoi aurait-on intérêt à conserver du stock ? Vous virez des fonds vers une société Française, il y a quand même plus risqué  Lightweight clients aren't zero-trust, pruned clients are. You should read the wiki. Nonoui, mais vous ne savez pas dans quel sens ca va changer
Yeah right. I do agree with your bottom-line though that there is some insider trading to be made. Who knows, maybe some folks at wordpress bought a lot of coins anticipating their announcement. yeah well, something happened : we drank champagne  Where are you located ?

Shtylman is in a massive debt towards its users. And not so surprisingly he starts defining Bitcoins as monopoly money as soon as you start reminding him of it. And for some reason a couple idiots follow him...The only reason there are massive bids, is that people want to get out of bitfloor and put as much distance between them and the massive pile of fail it has become.Shtylman, you're dead in this business, so is your exchange. youtube or it didn't happen very interesting read You like R1's?

Yo.Quelqu'un veut qu'on se fasse une block reward halving party sur Paris ?Visiblement ce sera vers mercredi soir 22h. Nous allons annoncer quelque chose à ce sujet dans les prochains jours.Exactement Define "rightful owner" Read the OP before posting You got it Le point que tu évoques ne fait pas débat.Bitcoin n'est pas une monnaie électronique dans la mesure ou il n'est pas un titre de créance ("claim on the issuer").L'affaire CIC vs MACARAJA (Mtgox) ne parle pas de ce point mais se concentre sur le fait que mtgox a voulu exercer, sans licence d'aucune sorte, une profession reglementée. Le point qui posait problème est le fait que mtgox ouvrait des comptes à des tiers pour y déposer des fonds, ce qui est le monopole des banques et établissements de paiement (au sens de la directive Européenne sur les services de paiement, ou DSP).
Est considérée comme devise une monnaie ayant cours légal dans un pays reconnu par la France.Bonne question.Ce n'est pas comme ca que ca marche dans la réalité, du point de vue légal je ne sais pas. Tout ce que je sais c'est que ce problème laisse pas mal de gens très intelligents assez perplexes.L'or est une ressource, il n'est cependant pas passible de TVA sur sa vente mais de taxe sur les plus-values réalisées à sa revente. Je pense que vous confondez SEL et monnaies complémentaires, je suis vraiment pas un expert du sujet ceci dit. Tu peux essayer Instawire.orgEn gros tu te créé une adresse, ensuite tu fais un virement bancaire vers le compte dont tu trouveras les coordonnées sur Instawire.org, et tu copie-colle ton adresse dans le champ "Motif" de ton virement.Quand le virement est reçu, l'argent est converti en Bitcoin et est envoyé sur l'adresse trouvée dans le champ "Motif"Bitcoin-otc c'est super pour faire de "vraies" transactions en pair-à-pair, ca suppose de savoir créer une clef PGP, d'utiliser IRC et de demander une "cloak" au staff freenode.C'est vraiment dans le pur esprit décentralisé de Bitcoin mais ce n'est pas vraiment le plus simple. Ca reste un ensemble restreint de personnes. À mon sens il ne faut pas raisonner en nombre de personnes mais plutôt se demander si cet ensemble est constitué de participants volontaires. Ce qui en l'espèce est le cas.Les échanges sont limités aux biens et services que sont prêts à te proposer des acteurs économiques qui souhaitent transacter en Bitcoin. Pas de problème de ce côté la pour moi.Non, c'est du troc en l'état actuel de la législation. Par ailleurs, le L521-2 concerne les prestations de service de paiement qui ne concernent pas Bitcoin, une transaction Bitcoin n'étant pas considérée comme un paiement.Non.Bitcoin n'est même pas considéré comme une devise... Donc pour considérer un mineur comme un PSP il y a une bonne marge.Un prestataire de services de paiement fournit en général des services autour de monnaies électroniques. La monnaie électronique est définie comme un titre de créance. Le Bitcoin n'est pas un titre de créance mais une ressource numérique.Non le transfert de Bitcoins n'est pas assujeti à TVA, ce serait quand-même fort...À mon avis, la tenue d'une caisse en BTC s'apparente simplement au suivi d'un stock d'une matière arbitraire. Make a list of all balances paired with a hash of the account number.Sign some random message with each private key holding funds.Everyone can check that their balance is correctly reported, everyone can check that the sum of balances is actually under control of the exchange.In order to be fully complete the exchange needs to deliver signed account balances to individual users.

Interested in the answer Good answer A harder one now : What do you think about the whole architecture, to be more precise, about the fact that everything runs inside resque workers leading to potential race conditions, and unexpected behaviour ? Did you make any changes to the way things run and the order in which they run ? Op bitcoin-central.net kan je je bitcoins makkelijk verkopen.En het is ook goedkooper dan de rest. I am inclined to believe you are a fucking genius. Firstbits on Instawire = bad ideaIt has actually been discussed on the two previous pages.
No worries! You forgot to mention that a lot of times the reference field will not only get uppercased but also truncated. But that's covered too.The simpler the service looks from the outside, the more magic happens behind the scenes  Thank you Einstein, please have a look at this little bit of code.Code:class Sale < ActiveRecord::Base  [...]  def self.sales_for(full_btc_address)    Sale.where("(full_btc_address = ?) OR (? LIKE UPPER(CONCAT(received_btc_address, '%')))",      full_btc_address,      full_btc_address.upcase    )  end  [...]endI assume I don't need to show you the door. Nice! let's see if you know what you're doing by answering this :Did you guys change only the database schema or the code as well, and if you changed the code can you give a couple of examples of what you changed ?  Tracfin just observes the money laudndering trends and practices and investigates on the suspicion notices of banks or PSPs.It doesn't really make any statement regarding the legality of a Bitcoin exchange. Yes, we'll look into it and send your transfer tomorrow if it hasn't already been done.Refunds are not automated yet. So it has probably just slipped through the cracks. Sorry about that! Désolé, c'est notre faute.Nous n'avons pas pu recharger immédiatement le serveur à partir du stockage à froid quand son stock de Bitcoins "à chaud" est tombé à zéro.Toutes nos excuses à tous ceux qui, comme vous, ont eu à attendre un transfert qui aurait du être instantané.Toutes les transactions en attente ont été envoyées. C'est normal, les adresses de réception changent à chaque fois que vous recevez des fonds pour vous aider à protéger la confidentialité de vos transactions.Les anciennes adresses continuent, par ailleurs, à fonctionner indéfiniment. Could you add bitcoin-central.net ?There is no real-time feed, but there is a heavily cached bitcoincharts compatible API so you can poll it every second. So PatrickHarnett should either refund 50% of the loan on his own funds or get a scammer tag, because right now, I see only one party bearing the cost of what you argue (and which I do not argue one way or another) is a shared mistake. Moi je m'y perds un peu dans les différents types de clients légers. Don't feed the trolls, especially not the retarded ones. There already is. Si son problème est qu'il souhaite payer anonymement alors la solution n'est probablement pas du côté de la carte mais plutôt du côté de Bitcoin. On mtgox you need to get verified as soon as you want to deposit in euros.It's not really about user-friendlyness here, it's about being able to operate reliably without risking to end up with closed bank accounts.Additionnally 250 without identification seems perfectly reasonable to me for someone who wants to get started with Bitcoins.Don't get me wrong if it was just me I wouldn't bother with IDs and the like, but as an exchange operator I can tell you it's a necessary burden to ensure a pleasant experience for everyone. Have you looked into it ?I think it's an important feature for a wallet to send what its told to, not some other random amount  They're currently disabled but they're on their way back. Nice.How do you handle refunds ?And cases where the customer accidentally sends too much Bitcoins ? Speaking for bitcoin-central.netEverything is negotiable.Yes.No.Usually, wires are credited the day after they're sentThey're not implemented.Free internets and karma points. Apparently neither do you.
I still don't get what you were meaning by the reference to some exchange rate, but whatever, the idea is quite interesting.In your case do you need to type the coupon manually ? Can you scan it  somehow ?Do you get taken to a URL that already has the coupon as parameter ? With printed out qr codes that would be doable and would let people redeem the funds with a simple browser (scan code, get directed to wallet URL, no typing involved).I think there I'm misunderstanding something here, why would there be an exchange risk ? Does your ATM give out fiat ? Or Bitcoins ?It works the exact same if what you give is a funded wallet. You need to trust the person that gives the code or wallet to you until you spend it. Some wood picks are actually really good I could also settle for a pick made from bone. <--- You see this man ? He played with the real thing  You can legally get turtle shell picks if the material they're made from was gathered before they were classified as a protected species.I actually had one, it had a little "compliance" mark on it to certify that the stock was pre-existing to the ban on turtle hunting.I lost this pick and I'm willing to purchase a new one.I'll spend my coins on the real deal, not some substitute. If they were easy to find I would just pay with fiat  That's the thing, I see this kind of use case best served by advanced wallets such as Blockchain.In my view it's not really a use-case to focus on in order to address the mass-market.But hey, I might wrong, nothing is written in stone.I never had any problem with you developing new features for easywallet I might actually copy on instawallet the ability to display amounts in fiat that I find really useful and convenient on easywallet (not implying that I use easywallet :p )Have you ever thought about the fact that a coupon is functionnally the exact same as a wallet URL ?I mean, if you give out a wallet URL that contains 1 BTC it's the exact same as giving out a 1 BTC easywallet coupon.In both cases you need to trust the one who's giving you the coupon or the URL to not spend the Bitcoin before you.Did I miss something that makes them really different ? I would totally pay for a turtle shell pick with my precious Bitcoins Does the iPhone app round sent amounts somehow ?If I'm trying to send say 1.23456789 by scanning a Bitcoin URI what actually get sent is 1.23456700 It seems to me that the easiest way to exchange Bitcoins in a face to face transaction is to use an e-wallet on a smartphone with qr code scan capabilities.For some reason I can't really picture folks exchanging cash for a private key. IMHO that's not relevant in the context of Instawallet-like services. If you are to print something on a piece of paper to hand to someone, you might as well print the QR code for the wallet URL. You skip the whole, scan, redeem, wait for confirmations part.My philosophy about keeping a product simple and usable is to be really selective as to which features you implement. The typical example of this is for example the ability to issue redeemable codes from easywallet. Like, seriously ? Reinventing the wheel when the easywallet URL itself serves the same purpose ? Price formulas ? Seriously ? Maybe it will be cheaper for you to wire funds to our EUR account after getting them converted.(Don't send GBP to our EUR account or the other way around, our bank charges ridiculous foreign exchange fees). Well, read the source. In this case it does He did, not 100%, but again, if you read the source you'll see that the hedge percentage displayed on his frontpage wasn't a fantasy.I think the reason why this will fail is that the operators don't seem to have the slightest clue about what they're doing and what they're stepping into. Correct.Yes, but we've yet to decide whether they are going to be on separate markets like they used to, or merged within their respective fiat markets.No. However we plan on rolling-out a multi-currency trading engine quite soon. That would that your USD ask orders could execute against GBP bids.The feature exists, it just hasn't been rolled-out yet. It's coming soon  Nope, that would be Bitcoin-Central.net, open-source exchange, older than Britcoin (aka Intersango). Operating smoothly since December 2010. Never hacked.Since Intersango is apparently unable to keep it together we're launching a new GBP market. Lowest fees available (free incoming wires, 0.99 GBP outgoing wires, 0.498% trade fee) You can use Bitcoin-Central.net, we just opened a GBP market.You can wire transfer GBP free of charge (no conversion or receiving charge at all) and fast (24h avg. with a SEPA transfer).The trade fee is the lowest you'll find at 0.498%Cheers! The depth chart will start working once there are a couple of bids/asks. I'm happy to announce that Bitcoin-Central now features a GBP market in addition to the EUR market.Intersango and MtGox are not accepting incoming GBP wires to their UK bank accounts due to these accounts being closed/frozen by their respective banks. Additionnally Intersango appears to be going belly up, they are not even accepting new registrations anymore due to their team not being able to work full-time on the service.In this context, we at Paymium, felt that it would be a good opportunity to provide the Bitcoin community with an alternative GBP market.All our fees are lower than both MtGox and Intersango : - Fund your account with a GBP wire : FREE - Withdraw with a GBP bank wire to a UK bank account : 0.99 GBP - Trade fee : 0.498% (special deals may be available to liquidity providers)Bitcoin-Central proudly provides the community with an advanced, secure and open-source platform since december 2010. Please do. If you contribute to providing liquidity and give us some volume we'll definitely cut you a nice deal on the trading fee. Do you like the spread better now ? 
We can't do anything about this chicken and egg problem, the free market will take care of that.The spread will automatically reduce when people start submitting orders and doing arbitrage.We offer lower fees, and, I believe, a much more professionnal service, so IMHO there is no really no reason that some GBP trading volume moves our way. Bitcoin-Central.net has now opened a GBP market.GBP deposits are absolutely free, you wire 100 GBP, you get credited 100 GBP.GBP withdrawals incur a 0.99 GBP fee.The trade fee is 0.498% which is cheaper than *any* other alternative. Bitcoin-Central.net has now opened a GBP market.GBP deposits are absolutely free, you wire 100 GBP, you get credited 100 GBP.GBP withdrawals incur a 0.99 GBP fee.The trade fee is 0.498% which is cheaper than *any* other alternative. This Yes, zhoutong did use floating point numbers everywhere. And he actually lied about that on a couple of occasions.Nobody's arguing that.I'm sorry what are you saying? That it doesn't matter? We're tomorrow, and I'm very interested in the transcript  Did you change the storage of monetary amounts ?Because what I saw in Bitcoinica's source was really the typical example of what *not* to do. Instawallet doesn't really make such a guarantee but getting the same coins you sent is quite unlikely since bitcoind will prefer sending aged coins instead of fresher ones. Also than can be indepently checked, on blockchain.info for example So, any significant difference except for the price ? How does the service compare to using Instawallet over Tor ? What about the infamous race conditions ? Nice, but you could have at least plugged the most obvious security holes of the Bitcoinica source code before re-using it. what makes you think that cc fees are lower than wire fees ? Charlie, you seem, once again, to have a problem with facts.You guys are registered as money transmitters, and not as "Seller or redeemer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value.", and only in NY.So it's either you don't even know what you're talking about, or you're lying. You're a rockstar. Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir have already answered.See previous posts. That's really interesting, the solution might or might not be the best one, but the problem is interesting.On an unrelated note, it's not the first time I see you mentioning costumers, makes me smile each time Makes me think of this :As opposed to this :  Emailed them, got a nice response :And their response : Not really, but if you make a dedicated address you'll track it easily since customers and affiliates are paid in the same transaction.But indeed, you can't really track the clicks currently. I don't know if there are other rulings, I believe not outside of this series (a couple of preliminary rulings were made prior to this one, but they are all summed up in the one I posted which is the final ruling).I don't know if this ruling sets a precedent.What I know is that the legislation is supposed to be consistent accross Europe, Paymium (the company I work for) got some specialized legal advice regarding this matter, and we found that in order to operate the Bitcoin-Central exchange securely (as in secure for our users fiat funds), we had to implement some legal compliance steps that go way beyond implementing some KYC/AML/CTF procedures according to the Payment Services Providers and Electronic Money Services European regulations.I don't believe this to be true, the MSB registration form is fillable online and it's like two pages long. And if Bitinstant did it, and if karpeles threw 10kBTC at the Bitcoin Foundation I really see no excuse for mtgox to at least try it.If you read the whole court ruling you'll see that at some points karpeles outright lies to the court, so I would take his word with a grain of salt.Page 7Oh, and another gem on page 11In other words mtgox is investing your money.Again, these regulations are relevant to licensed financial institutions, and their contractual partners. I have no proof that mtgox is not a contractual partner of a licensed financial institution (absence of proof is obviously not a proof of absence) but I feel that if they did land such a partnership they would have at least bragged about it, and they would be required to include it in their ToS.Again, what bothers me here is not that mtgox is unlicensed, it is that they appear to not even try (remember if Bitinstant did it, why would mtgox fail if it tried). 
Check your facts, a ruling was made in a French court on September 13th 2011.I dropboxed the full transcript here for your records.It is in French obviously, so let me take the liberty of translating a few interesting sentences from the ruling summary on page 18 for you :Why do you think they moved their main operational EUR account to some random polish bank ?(Note : Macaraja is a French company owned by karpeles, incorporated way before Bitcoin was even invented, it was doing software development before starting to serve pretty much the same purpose Mutum Sigillum currently serves) Irrelevant, you missed the whole "MSB" part.Check my source, you'll find Bitinstant, you won't find Mutum Sigillum. Even *they* wouldn't dare to make such a claim.I can't even find their little Delaware incorporated front (Mutum Sigillum) in the US MSB directory (http://www.fincen.gov/financial_institutions/msb/msbstateselector.html)So if you have information that we don't have feel free to share, and feel free to check the facts. Financial institutions have to comply with the AML regulations through the implementation of KYC procedures.mtgox is a financial institution only in the imagination of mark karpeles. It's actually an open source project that's older that intersango, in fact it was launched in late 2010.The address is required by our bank for outgoing SEPA withdrawals. Bitcoin-Central.net Monitoring. Forget these suckers.Make an offer.A real one.Also anyone can sell their signature to InstaWire.org, see here. No, it's related to the fact that there are precise rules as to who can open accounts, and store currency on behalf of a third-party.The problem would be *exactly* the same even if Bitcoin was regulated or if exchanges were dealing with bananas. The reason bank accounts from exchanges get frozen is not that they deal or are related with Bitcoin.It's very precise : - Banks have the obligation to ascertain the real beneficiary of funds that are deposited, with a Bitcoin exchange they can't. - Only licensed financial institutions have the right to open "accounts" for the general public and more generally store funds on behalf of third-parties.The problem has nothing to do with Bitcoin in itself. I'm kind of agreeing with OP, this has been in discussion for a long long time. See the whole account hubs discussion that took place ages ago.It isn't about whether we can, it's about whether we should, what's more efficient in economical terms, what's simpler for the mass, what gives the merchant a contractual guarantee to get paid.Yes, technically we all agree that it is possible, that the network can or will be able to take it, but that's not necessarily what makes the most sense.I have no crystall ball but I'm pretty sure that in the future a good share of the actual payments and transactions won't ever hit the blockchain. They accounted for it, not specifically as change but seeing those as loops to the same owner in the transactions graph. J'ai juste dit de faire attention, pas que c'était nécessairement une arnaque  Le nom de domaine du site a été enregistré il y a deux semaines par un russe à New York qui ne fournit comme contact qu'une adresse tormail.Un bitcoiner averti en vaut deux  The figures about Instawallet do not seem correct, on May 13th there were 103,513 wallets having at least one incoming transaction, the paper mentions 23,649 different addresses (one wallet = one address on Instawallet).Source :Code:SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wallets WHERE   EXISTS (SELECT * FROM transfers WHERE `key` = wallet_key) AND  created_at <= '2012-05-13' Not on my watch Go for it. If you're manly enough Rails is the best choice. Fair enough, now you only see obfuscated e-mails and IBANs, no names anymore. Also since day one we limit the number of address inputs per hour and per IP to 3 making it quite hard to bruteforce.Well, the truth is that humans set the price. There really is no algorithm. Sometimes we'll be a little more expensive than others, and sometimes we'll be a comparatively cheap. TL;DR; -- The documentation is here : https://github.com/Paymium/Paytunia-API-v1-documentationI got a bunch of interesting questions from someone wanting to consume the Bitcoin-Central.net/Paytunia.com API and thought that it might be useful to share it publicly.If you happen to have questions on the API feel free to ask or comment here.Paytunia and Bitcoin-Central are basically two different front-ends to the same application, they are served by the same code and they sit on the same database. The main difference is the UI. Also some API calls, and especially these related to trading are only available when using Bitcoin-Central based URIs.It may seem kind of crazy from an external point of view, but there is a good reason it was set this way. The reason is simply that we tried to get a Paytunia iPhone app approved a while ago, and in order to get it approved we felt that we should not mention any trading at all on the app or on the Paytunia website whatsoever.That's why Paytunia pretty much only has the wallet functionality of Bitcoin-Central.In short : use https://bitcoin-central.net as base for *all* your API calls.If you wish to have French localized human strings use https://fr.bitcoin-central.net, (you could also use https://en.bitcoin-central.net but English being the default it doesn't really make sense).What you experience on the order book is perfectly normal, with a RESTful API you request a resource, and if you do not tell the server which format should be used for the response it will default to HTML. If you want the resource returned in JSON you must tell the server. To do so you have two different options : either you add a .json extenstion at the end of the URL (when using a browser for example), or you add a HTTP header "Accept: application/json". That's explained in the "Required HTTP headers" part of the documentation.Regarding the authentication of calls there are no specific fields you must pass in the body of your request, in fact the authentication mechanism is standard HTTP Basic authentication (see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). The credentials are passed in a header. Any decent HTTP access library will have this functionality already built-in. Check your library if any, otherwise just add the header as described on the wikipedia page. For example if you use cURL just pass a -u 'user:password' option to the command.Our API is RESTful, meaning it's based on resource URIs and HTTP verbs. For example with a trade order, if you issue a GET request against the order URI you'll be given the order representation, either in HTML or in JSON, depending on what you request, you may also issue DELETE requests against the same URI to cancel it. If you want to place an order you can just POST to the URI of the order collection (/account/trade_orders IIRC) in order to add an order to the collection. It's just the REST paradigm. Lots of APIs work this way. Regarding the fact that you have to submit a JSON string, you can also pass parameters in the URL in the following way : POST /account/trade_orders?trade_order[amount]=30&trade_order[currency]=EUR&... or as posted form data, it doesn't really matter, it'll get parsed the same way. Have a look here for more information on RESTful web services : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_servicesWhenever a resource gets created (you post a trade order, you create a money transfer etc.) you'll get 201. For all other successful responses you'll get a 200.Yeah, that's a mistake in the documentation you should query /ticker.json (with the optional currency parameter). You're getting an error because you're implictly requesting HTML but there is no specific HTML representation of the ticker. (we'll fix that in the documentation)Yes, we should define them better. But I guess with the example it's pretty transparent, isn't it ?You can also post market orders. Market orders are like limit orders except they don't have a limit price and will execute at any available market price. Have a look on the trade order creation form, you'll find a link to an in-depth explanation.That's because I want to remove this feature and simplify the logic around trade order execution. Right now, the way it works is that you can not place an order if you don't have enough funds (BTC or currency) to honor it fully, if you place your order and then withdraw currency or BTC leading to a state where you're unable to honor the order completely it gets inactivated. If you then add funds the order remains inactive, if it wasn't so, users could come to a point where they have old outstanding orders that suddenly execute when they add funds, at prices that aren't in line with the moving price of Bitcoins.No, currently if you do not have enough funds, the system will not let you place an order.This logic should be changed because it is not very intuitive and straightforward.
Fair enough, this should now be fixed. Thank you very much for the report !We usually update it once in the morning (unless wild price swings happen during the day), sometimes you'll end up paying a little less on Instawire than the average price on bitcoin charts, sometimes a little more. At the end of the day that's not what Instawire is about. Instawire is about bridging the gap between the traditional banking system and the Bitcoin world in the most possible elegant way Instawire offers no such feature, there are no plans to implement it. That's how we roll.We will probably never support firstbits addresses, think about it for a minute, by inputting someone's address I can instantly find out whether this person transacted with Instawire, what this person's IBAN and name are. Probably not the best idea when firstbits are often part of forum signatures.Additionnally, we rely a lot on bank wire references, these references can get truncated along the way, with a regular address that's not an issue, you can immediately see if it's valid or not and complete it at the moment the user inputs his full address. Truncating firstbits could be catastrophic since truncated firstbits could possibly resolve to a completely different address than the one originally intended. hahaha win Made me rock my chair Take this one : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4mc5R3xuLo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Onjh6YjnSd8 How do i reduce ephedrine without complicated equipment or precursors?

Can I cancel a transaction because the rate has changed between the time I sent the money and the time the rate was frozen ?A. Yes, absolutely.Q. Why are you asking for an identification document ?A. Because we need to mitigate the risk of accepting fraudulent incoming wires (in other words : wires that come from phished bank accounts)Q. I don't like you guys being so nosy, can I cancel my transfer without providing an identification document ?A. Yes, absolutely, we'll send the money back to the account it came from.Q. Do you accept international wires ?A. Yes, but our bank can charge us fees that we'll have to factor in to your sale. Only wires EUR wires coming from the SEPA zone are guaranteed to be free on our end. La réponse est dans la questionC'est un investissement très risqué, mais potentiellement très lucratif. Mais c'est aussi et surtout une invention qui va changer le monde  Just open instawallet.org in Safari on an iOS 6 device. MtGox *does* the hosting, in other words, they can read your PMs. Ok smartass, let me just quote wikipedia for you Oh, and what are you doing here ? How about letting the grown-ups do the talking ? Makes me think about thermos. Coffee anyone ?Mine comes from :davout = davoutplantaire = david + voûte plantaire (sole of feet)Don't ask me why, I'm not the one that came up with it Also my avatar is django reinhardt, see : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6uXGSTfz_4 Ton client n'est pas encore à jour avec la chaîne de blocs. Ton paiement apparaîtra quand ton client aura téléchargé le bloc qui le contient (> 200,000 probablement)Oui, absolument Security through obscurity is not security.Why not ? Say you hash the account identifiers (maybe with a per-account secret), pair them with their balance, sum the balances in a nice report.Anyone can verify they are in the balance list, no one can look my balance up, I can check that the sum is consistent with the amount in cold storage.That can also be seen as some sort of backup if properly signed, I'm sure the Bitcoinica folks would have loved to have something like that lying around. Coming from you it's kind of a really weird thing to say. You do sell 1000 BTC casascius gold coins right ? Yeah, that's what I thought.Whatever man, you're the one that can potentially run away with thousands of BTC worth of private keys and your only comment on this service is that we shouldn't trust banks to properly execute transfers 100 worth ? The banhammer is used only for maliciously crafted requests. And unless you're a jew or a salmon this bear could actually be nice to you ! Um... What? I might start a clone after all  No worries  We pay a network fee if required, we don't want our user's transactions to get stuck in limbo.It isn't really a problem because we have a very large volume that makes us able to use old inputs in order to not pay any fee for 99.9% of transactions.That works well for transactions over 0.01, under that the DoS protection mechanism makes a fee mandatory.What you see on blockchain.info doesn't relate to your Instawallet as far as outgoing transactions are concerned, that's how a shared wallet works.OP, you may want to edit your title, nothing was stolen.
Yes, someone can't just empty your account with the banking information you transmit to an exchange. I feel really neutral about this foundation. Good for Gavin if it pays him a salary. As far as I'm concerned it's definitely not the face of Bitcoin or whatever, Bitcoin never had and never will have a face.I'm personnally not criticizing this venture, grown-ups make the corporations they want after all, with the goals they want to pursue and aren't accountable to this community. On the other hand I'd appreciate this being treated as it should, a service announcement, not something that's going to bring "great stability to Bitcoin". I find it a little weird that one day Gavin wants to be demoted from his global mod position, and the next one he yells at hazek for wanting to move the TBF thread into service announcements.Still, I wish the foundation, and Gavin personnally, good luck and much success! Je suis David FRANCOIS et j'approuve ce message <3 You should now be able to withdraw your coins. And no, nothing was hacked  not sure if serious  It's solved now, sorry for the downtime. If the address we receive is truncated, uppercased or otherwise invalid it gets corrected transparently as soon as the user checks for his transfer status by inputting his full and valid address in our interface.I highly doubt there is any manual intervention in transfers made from web interfaces, and even if there was, I think the risk is pretty equivalent to having your transfer maliciously re-routed to a different IBAN. Yes, except for the shutting down part. Bank wire, about to accept Ukash, unlike some other exchanges, if we're unable to verify your account (if applicable) we send the funds back to the bank account they came from (ie. we don't steal indefinitely freeze them)That makes sense and is a legitimate concern, if you're going to jump through the KYC loops, you might as well want to have your deposits insured along the way  No, I was referring to legal fiat deposit insurance that comes when you deposit funds in a regulated financial institution. As of today, no Bitcoin exchange has insured fiat deposits since no Bitcoin exchange is regulated as a financial insitution nor does any exchange partner with a financial instition for fiat storage.Currently, all Bitcoin exchanges work the same way, your fiat deposits are pooled on one or several bank accounts with no clear funds segregation. To have insured fiat deposits would mean that every single customer has a nominative account with a regulated financial institution (not necessarily a bank though) that could either be the exchange itself, or a business partner.There are both organizational and technical steps taken to protect customer funds : - The people who have full access to the bank account are clearly identified, they have different credentials to access our bank's interface, I personnally have read-only access, - The software has read-only access to the bank account, - The vast majority of our BTC deposits are in cold-storage, with the private keys securely stored in an actual bank safe meaning it's easy to send funds there, but hard to get them out, especially at gunpoint, - We keep very little funds on our servers, they are operating since late 2010 and to date have never been compromised, - We're very serious about preventing fraud and monitoring activity to avoid having bank accounts frozen or other bank-related issuesSecurity is *always* implemented in a combination of organizational and technical measures : - If you have reasonable technical measures but weak organizational procedures you end up with the Bitcoinica fiasco (employee steals the money), or the MtGox incident from June 2011 (an auditor's computer was compromised, had access to data he shouldn't have) - If you have weak technical measures you end up like Bitfloor (unencrypted backup gets compromised), - If you don't have very good relations with your bank you end up like Intersango/MtGox with accounts frozenThat's how we run things nope  Bitcoin-Central.net : open-source, launched in 2010, deals in EUR Bienvenue! This thread should be moved to "Service announcements" since it's simply announcing the formation of a US corporation that's looking for members. Bottom line : Bitfloor already has all the investors it needs, except they don't get either equity, or interest, but only a promise to "maybe" get repaid. In other words : they take the risk and don't get any kind of compensation for it.Clever stunt! Wow wow, hold on a minute there Last time I checked, mtgox wasn't licensed with the FSA (or any other similar body for the matter)And I doubt that GLBSE would be subject to any kind of securities-related laws, at least not before bitcoin gets defined as money.I would assume that the mtgox account got closed (I doubt it's actually 'suspended') because they're having the same problem as with the CIC in France. Probably the equivalent in the UK of the "unlicensed banking business" charges they had to face in France.They're lucky that their Polish bank doesn't seem to care. +=no Bootstrap gets some boring stuff out of the way, and ultimately gets your product faster on the market.

Ca y est, suite à notre prise de contact le problème a été réglé par le Crédit Agricole.Les virements vers notre compte depuis leur banque en ligne fonctionnement maintenant à nouveau correctement. The original InstaWire.org announcement is hereDo you have a blog, website, or twitter?Earn free bitcoins with our affiliate program! We'll send you 1% of bitcoins sold through you. No signup is required, and it only takes a few seconds to setup.How it worksAdd a link to your blog, website, or tweet pointing to:Code:https://instawire.org/?r=your_bitcoin_addressReplace 'your_bitcoin_address' with one of your bitcoin addresses.For example, if your bitcoin address is 1DavouTAsveznCFHsz688xvbrRAq4u2qm8, to create a link using HTML put this code somewhere on your website:Code:<a href="https://instawire.org/?r=1DavouTAsveznCFHsz688xvbrRAq4u2qm8">Purchase Bitcoins directly via wire transfer using InstaWire.</a>That's it, you're done! Now evertime someone buys bitcoins using that link, 1% of the amount sold will be sent directly to your bitcoin address as a reward. There is no amount or time limit for your link!ExampleJohn sees your tweet mentioning and linking to your InstaWire affiliate address. He clicks on the link and decides to purchase 10 bitcoins. After the transaction is approved, John will receive 10 bitcoins and we will send 0.1 bitcoins to your address. We got our first two customers yesterday!And they went through my affiliate link   Blockchain isn't a shared wallet, your coins aren't pooled with other ones there. The coins you deposit will be the same coins you withdraw.Just pick one that lets you connect through Tor, like Instawallet for example  You don't need to become a bank to become compliant. Compliance can be much cheaper than that. Well, apparently BF customers seem happy about it. is it ? BF is pretty much bailing itself out by taking a forced 0% interest loan on people who have coins "on hold" there. Ca dépend du marché, de l'état de notre stock, à quel prix nous l'avons constitué et de notre opinion sur la tendance. So, when are you guys getting a proper financial license ? No, if I did not remove it completely it is a mistake.I'm glad you like it  Yes, unless MtGox decides to AMhell you.MtGox is a really bad pick though because they won't let you connect through Tor and might request your ID.Any big shared wallet to which you can connect through Tor will be fine.The waiting period is important because your funds usually get mixed with hot funds, and not the cold wallet (unless you wait enough), so you should : - pick a fat shared wallet that lets you connect anonymously - wait a couple of days before withdrawing - withdraw in random amounts to random addresses I'll just leave this here : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=112402.0 We're working on accepting USD through Dwolla and other methods, that should come pretty soon.  TL;DR : Paste a Bitcoin address in a bank wire "reference" field. Bitcoins automatically sent to that address. Also refer your friends and get 1% of what we sell.Hello everyone!I'm very proud to announce that Paymium is launching a new original service called InstaWire, it's available at https://instawire.org.It'll let you buy Bitcoins hassle-free by simply pasting your Bitcoin address in the "Comments" field of a bank wire. It's mostly intended for beginners or people who want to buy a few coins from time to time without the pain of registering an account on an exchange or going through AMhell.The price will vary depending on market conditions and include a small commission.We also have a nice affiliation program where you direct customers to us through a specially crafted link containing your Bitcoin address and you are rewarded with 1% of the Bitcoins sold. So if you refer Paul to us and Paul buys 100 BTC on InstaWire, we reward you with 1 BTC out of our own pocket. Just craft your URL like this : https://instawire.org/?r=1DavouTAsveznCFHsz688xvbrRAq4u2qm8 put in on your blog, your signature, get its QR code tattoed on your chest and listen to the sweet sound of Bitcoins rolling in. (Pro-tip : we haven't edited the wiki pages yet to add InstaWire to the lists) Non, si tu veux faire des achats tu peux payer directement à partir de ton compte Bitcoin-Central.net  You don't understand hox shared wallets like mtgox work. You don't even need to trade your coins for them to get mixed. Wasn't that an edit ? Sorry if it wasn't and I overlooked it Yep, but that isn't blockchain.info anymore, that's blockchain.info + a plugin.My mom still has issues with the concepts of copy and paste I do agree, but many people still think it's some kind of security silver bullet where they don't have to trust the operator since he "doesn't have access to your keys". Honestly, how much people do you think use some kind of JS verifier ?
Absolutely, I don't really see why the blockchain should be the one-size-fits-all answer for all money transfer use cases. Now if your opinion is different 'Right' isn't really going to cut it Picture it this way, fast-forward ten years, blockchain is overcrowded, Bitcoin transactions will be much more expensive and slower. What will be exchanged will be Bitcoin certificates, not actual Bitcoins. History repeats itself. But this time you'll have a the choice, this time you will be able to safely store your digital gold yourself, you'll keep some money in an e-wallet and your savings in your brainwallet. I smell some Stockholm syndrome Hosted wallets, account hubs.In the future I see the blockchain used mainly for inter-bank compensation. Bitcoin will be the foundation for overlay protocols, its raw form wouldn't be used by housewives. Hmm. 100% fractional reserve. Fallacy, has been discussed before hereTL;DR : Your bitcoins can easily get stolen if the server gets compromised, the owner threatened or if he goes rogue, and that's simply because javascript is dynamically served from the server, it can be modified at will by anyone accessing the server. Next time you should probably use Paytunia for Android instead of insisting on having actual money actually bound to a phone. Phones get lost, stolen, can break ... Les ASIC ne changeront rien à la difficulté pour la simple raison qu'ils sont déjà en train de miner mais chez BFL (ils auraient tort de pas en profiter un peu!) Maybe you should be scolded too for being equally vague in your definition of "confirmed".  it really wasn't a good idea,and that's precisely why,if you want to mix coins, use a big shared wallet that'll do it anonymously and for free, not a shared wallet hiding behind a Tor veil. Bienvenue ! Just see that as an incentive to create or provide, directly or indirectly, something desirable.Yes, if I really desire these services  The more time passes the easier it seems to juice coins out of fools On a eu des infos de première main, notre IBAN est bien black-listé au CA.Nous travaillons avec nos contacts chez eux pour faire débloquer la situation, ca ne s'annonce pas trop mal mais ca risque de prendre encore un peu de temps. Seems like this kind of stuff is happening a lot lately with them  See : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=105638.0Don't hope too much from posting on the forums, if MT shows up he'll probably try to find some way to sling some mud in your face without bothering to make anything right or answer legitimate questions and concerns.Oh, and don't really expect them to make it right for you when they update their automated procedures because data migration is, you know, "not practical" : Not really, they act as a Payment Services Provider (an almost-bank), they keep your fiat money in a nominative account, you can use them to transfer money around without ever touching the Bitcoin side of things. 10G isn't that much, your plan looks quite smallish  Then talk 
It would be quite foolish if he had a master password unlocking all the cold funds. Je te le conseille pas Could probably run it without sudo'ing but I'm a complete noob at python I stopped right at sudo Good for you ! Polling another box? Connections allowed only from select IPs? I don't see an investor buying a business with such a low entry barrier, a quarter million dollar debt, and (AFAIK) no valuable partnerships or financial licenses. That's normal MT edited his post afterwards to add this, maybe because he felt like somehow diverting the thread from the actual issue at hand was necessary.Right now bitcoin.fr hosts an ad-ridden crappy blog with the last post being months old, see for yourself. We felt that the French public deserved a better introduction to Bitcoin than a placeholder site waiting for the domain value to go up.And so yes, we wanted bitcoin.fr to redirect to a french version of bitcoin.org.The full e-mail exchange is here, judge for yourself.A couple of highlights :Either way this is way off-topic, if there are any questions about this please make another thread, I'll happily comment there.We take full responsibility and stand by our actions. It would be nice to see a bit less mudslinging and a bit more responsibility from a commercial company handling my passport scans. (Read: acknowledge a sub-optimal data migration and unfreeze my account after digging in the AML archive for thirty seconds, if necessary reduce the withdrawal limits to those of an unverified account). Very sorry to hear that.   Will do next time.Oh sorry then, I guess my withdraw limits magically went to those of a verified account, see previous screenshot. Or your very own DB if you don't trust me.This must be some kind of joke. When I trade on your platform I don't find it practical to pay fees, can I skip that ?We all pay to use mtgox, in exchange we all expect some level of service, part of that would be that when you migrate a system, you migrate the data that goes with it even if it's "not practical".Fine, I have no problem with that. Just don't lock down my account, give it unverified withdrawal limits if there are documents missing.Again, my limits say otherwise, and I didn't get notified of anything related to having to submit additional documentation.Pathetic. Last response from the support :My answer : - My account is verified - You have a copy of my passport - You sent a Yubikey to my home address - My account didn't go to an "Unverified" state, it went to "Fully locked". Right now I can not withdraw even a single bitcent.If you want to somehow unverify my account because the documenation I submitted isn't enough anymore then fine, but take me to "Unverified", not "Locked down".Additionnaly if there are additional verification requirements since September 2011 you should have notified me in advance, let me decide whether I wanted to comply or take my business elsewhere. But CERTAINLY NOT freeze my account and lock my funds without any kind of police report or accountability.I do not think it is bad to have stringent AML requirements, it's even necessary. But the way they are implemented in my particular case is not acceptable. I refuse to see my money frozen arbitrarily and instantly.The minute my account becomes unlocked I will repost my documentation because I'm willing to comply with the AML requirements. What I do not accept is the "locked funds" way of bullying people.See my withdrawal limits to check that my account was indeed verified : Does that mean I'll have to get through this each time someone in my office building creates a mtgox account? That sounds like a really useful security feature :|What is definitely is arbitrary is the bullying. Just because you can freeze my account doesn't mean it's ok to do so as an answer to everything that can happen. Especially when the account is verified, and is protected by a yubikey that you sent to my home address. the site is serving executable JS code, you need to trust it too. I think the customer service itself is ok they're nice and, in my experience, quite responsive.It's the rule that's being applied that just doesn't make any sense. Let's even say it's ok to auto-freeze accounts when you detect that the same IP connects to them. In this case the support should simply unlock the accounts when they get the full story : "Oh, you actually have accesses to multiple legitimately verified accounts from the same IP, one is the corporate account, the one is your personal one ? I understand, I'll unlock them for you right now. Have a beautiful day fine sir!" So here's what happened : - was minding my own business, playing around MtGox's API's - tried to withdraw some USD as an MtGox code, - failed and got answer "Your account is pending verification"So apparently it's because Paymium and I both have MtGox accounts, and we're connecting from the same IP (wow, surprise surprise)So because of that my account is now frozen and I'm required to get "verified" (even though they do have a scan of my passport and they do have a proof of address in the form of a Yubikey sent to my home)And apparently MT has too much on his plate to even acknowledge an IRC message.So beware, MtGox won't hesitate to arbitrarily prevent you from accessing your very own money, and a verified account won't help.You already have those my friend.If you migrate your system it is your responsibility to migrate customer data. Freezing accounts until people re-upload what they already have is not a professional way of doing things.I'm quite pissed-off right now. Just because you guys hold my money doesn't mean you get to freeze it at will. There was a small software issue a few hours ago. It's been fixed. You should use Paytunia (paytunia.com), it's really simple, does the job right, you can protect it with two factor, has never been hacked and has mobile apps. You may Sellers will get better prices on BC than on mtgox Software glitch. Fixed now. You should see your coins   You should use bitcoin-central.net
word Intéressant... Idéalement il faudrait que ton agence te réponde par écrit, ca nous permettrait de leur passer un petit coup de fil amical par la suite. Oh god, you made my day Signing a message with a private key doesn't prove anything.Controlling funds doesn't mean they're yours to spend. Haha nice! Happy birthday! dafuck Why don't you just call it bitpay ? I'll do itEDIT : I failed miserably  Ik ga  You make good points but regardless, it will happen if there is a use for it, if it fits in the existing protocol, if it's easy to implement (applying a patch to the source counts as easy), and if it's cost-effective. Some other options are superior, but this one would be good enough for lots of folks.Looks fairly easy to implement, and maybe miners will see an opportunity to charge higher fees. Might not be good for the performance of subsequent tx validations, but that's irrelevant since miners have no economic incentive, that I know of, to facilitate tx validation for other peers.Of course, built-in out-of-band authentication would be neat  I think it's great.There is no such thing as a "bitcoin privacy model". There are steps one can take to improve the anonymous properties of Bitcoin. The green address system is opt-in.That somewhat goes with the "instant transfer" feature, I don't think you can really have this without leaving some key online at some point. You could still mitigate that risk by using a multiple signature address as marker address."conveying information that is only interesting to a single pair of parties" is pretty much what Bitcoin already does. At the end of the day it's the market that will decide what's a fair price for this additional bit of information. It seems logical that instant transactions between green-address aware parties might cost a little more.You just need blockexplorer or a similar tool to validate a green address transfer which is much simpler than validating a detached signature. That same actor does appear in Weeds in the rehab sessions when Celia Hodes gets hooked on blow. Not exactly a crossover but I did feel some butterflies in my belly. Yes absolutely, in the previous example I assumed there was only one open position, but with multiple open positions it's a different story. The house simply gets its loan back by buying back when the price rises when liquidating a short.Actually, the more money you make, the more money the house makes, there is definitely no incentive to force-liquidate positions. The house doesn't make more money when the liquidation of a position is forced as opposed to triggered by the user. If someone is interested in trying out what I've been working on, send me a PM. Visiblement y'en a qui croient encore au père-noël ici... Ils vous ont dit que c'était spécifique à votre agence ?Vous pouvez m'envoyer votre numéro de compte BC en PM ?On va investiguer parce que ce genre de comportement n'est pas acceptable.Certainement pas, quand on fait les choses correctement il n'y a aucune raison que ça coince  On vous empêche de faire des virements ?
Même pour une carte prépayée Visa/Mastercard tu devras t'identifier. Tu ne pourras jamais ouvrir de compte bancaire sans t'identifier.C'est à ca que sert Bitcoin Pierre (aka Boussac) est notre délicieux directeur opérationnel/marketing/stratégie. fear, uncertainty and doubt Le truc c'est qu'il faut simplement choisir une "case" t'y tenir, et avoir une argumentation sensée derrière.Tu peux faire de la poterie à titre occasionnel et vendre tes poteries, elles n'existaient pas auparavant.La France, depuis une compte professionnel tout ce qu'il y a de plus respectable.OuiLe compte sera forcément nominatif, la carte ne fera toutefois pas nécessairement mention du nom du porteur.MastercardTu peux ouvrir un compte dans une banque cantonale sous réserve de rassurer un peu le banquier. L'idéal étant de lui dire que tu veux placer quelques économies parce que tu as peur pour la solidité financière des banques françaises. Le contexte s'y prête. Je ne suis malheureusement pas assez riche pour avoir testé mais je sais que c'est comme ca que ca marche. Wow Il faut bien distinguer deux aspects : - Les aspects fiscaux - Les aspects liés au blanchimentDu point de vue fiscal il y a simplement un risque en cas de contrôle fiscal si tu as reçu beaucoup et si tu n'as rien déclaré. Il faut qu'en cas de contrôle ou dans ta déclaration tu puisses faire rentrer les revenus dans une case. Conceptuellement si tu achètes et que tu revends ensuite je pense que ca rentre dans le cadre de l'imposition sur les plus values de cession de valeurs mobilières (comme des actions par exemple). Tu peux aussi bénéficier du régime de taxation applicable aux métaux précieux si le prestataire par qui tu passes pour acheter et/ou vendre te délivre des justificatifs, à l'heure actuelle, personne ne le fait. Paymium prévoit de lancer prochainement un service permettant de bénéficier du régime des métaux précieux (30% d'imposition sur la plus value OU 8% du montant total de la transaction). Enfin tu peux simplement faire passer ca comme la vente d'un véhicule automobile, ou cession exceptionnelle d'un bien meuble, auquel cas il me semble qu'il n'y a rien à déclarer, c'est ce que je ferais si je recevais par exemple 15000 en one shot.Du point de vue de la lutte contre le blanchiment la réponse est : ça dépend. Ca dépend de tes revenus habituels, de la régularité de ce que tu reçois et du montant. En dessous de 8 à 10000 annuels tu ne dépasses aucun seuil il me semble. Le principal risque est que ta banque fasse un signalement TRACFIN pour un soupçon de blanchiment de capitaux. Dans ce cas il faudra simplement expliquer la vérité et, à mon sens, il n'y aura pas de souci. Il faut faire preuve de bon sens je pense, si tu glisses un mot à ton banquier, que tu reçois une fois 20000 d'une société française c'est pas la même chose que de recevoir 3000 toutes les deux semaines d'un compte en pologne, suivez mon regard Il y a deux méthodes qui permettent de réduire le risque de stress superflu : - Passer par un prestataire qui te permet de dépenser directement ton argent sans avoir à le virer ailleurs (par exemple Bitcoin-Central proposera bientôt des cartes de paiement liées au solde en euros des clients) - Avoir un compte en Suisse. Or you choose to jailbreak your phone, or you choose to have a separate QR code reader, or you choose to build your app from source with xcode. I'm cool with that, and trust me, I do open source.Now you like Android, good for you I respect your choice, I'll personnally pass for now thank you very much. You should add kronos.io -> stalled Vous faites un contre-sens, d'un point de vue du risque fiscal vous identifier auprès de nous ne change rien.Votre identité ainsi que toutes vos coordonnées bancaires sont de toute façon inscrites dans le virement que nous recevons.Quand on vous demande une pièce d'identité ce n'est pas pour savoir qui vous êtes, si vous n'êtes pas un fraudeur alors on a déjà vos coordonnées  Oui elle existe, il y a même une documentation complète Ma prononciation "coin de table" ça écorche effectivement un peu les oreilles, mais bon, tous les goûts sont dans la nature  La raison pour les seuils bas est que d'une part on a une obligation d'identifier nos clients, mais aussi et surtout de nous prémunir contre la fraude.Le type de fraude le plus courant est l'utilisation d'un compte bancaire phishé pour nous faire des virements. Ca crée des gros problèmes avec la banque d'avoir des demandes de retour de virement. Ca se termine en général par un compte bancaire bloqué, le département compliance de la banque qui freine des quatre fers, des clients qui ne peuvent plus retirer d'argent etc. (Ca ne vous rapelle pas l'histoire du compte metro d'intersango?). Si intersango n'apprend pas de ses erreurs ils vont revenir dans les mêmes problèmes.Visiblement ce n'est pas le principe d'une identification du client qui vous embête mais surtout le montant, donc j'insiste sur la dessus : les montants qu'on reçoit de comptes phishés le justifie vraiment, croyez-moi que ce n'est pas la partie que je préfère du job En ce qui concerne la commission de retrait elle est à 0.99 maintenant, les tarifs ne sont plus à jour, on va les remettre à jour avec le déploiement de la nouvelle version du site qui nous prend tout notre temps  I'm interested in your potential findings  We're both right  As a general advice : use LESS and read this : http://ruby.bvision.com/blog/please-stop-embedding-bootstrap-classes-in-your-html Instawallet : never hacked, bitcoin-central/paytunia : never hacked.

I'd advise you to file a police report Second post was by you though.From : http://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm That wouldn't be the first one But still, that doesn't make much sense to me, from a legal POV to disclose very sensitive information to a public internet forum.Absence of proof is not proof of absence, therefore : assumption. Either way my point is that you shouldn't have released anything until contacted by an official law enforcement body. Because doing so would probably qualify as a big fat breach of privacy, decency, and your own very terms.It's not the community's role to investage, nor is it yours. I'm simply arguing that the information flow you're mentioning might not be the most appropriate, it might somehow be in your interest, but I fail to see how it's in the victims best interests.That sounds about right, maybe you should have stopped right there.Let's agree to disagree Ok, so what was the advice ? Publish this kind of sensitive information on a public forum? To achieve what? That's what I thought. Releasing a statement to ZT about his money being frozen : sounds ok to me.Publishing a statement to an angry mob looking for a scapegoat : probably not the smartest thing.I highly doubt that AE's legal counsel advised them to publish anything on a public internet forum.This is an assumption, not a fact.A financial institution has to freeze funds if they suspect illegal activity/ML and report it to the authorities.I'm not saying it would have been smart to release the funds, but maybe it isn't very smart either to release this kind of information on a public forum and not report anything to the police (AFAIK you haven't done that, have you?).The only rocks being thrown are being targeted at ZT. Look at it this way : what has been achieved by posting this info here ? Nothing. Will it help an actual police investigation? Probably the opposite. This.If information has to be released, release it to the police.I'm quite unclear as to why the involved parties are disclosing this kind of information on a public internet forum.At worst it might even harm an official investigation.I'm curious about AurumExchange's and MT's actual motivations for posting all this. It also exists for iOS and it's free to download on the appstore.See : http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/scanbook-bitcoin-address-utility/id536215208?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D2 It already exists for iOS and it's free to download on the appstore.See : http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/scanbook-bitcoin-address-utility/id536215208?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D2 Hahaha, this, a million times. A mixing service on TOR is a terrible concept.Use what already exists.
no The information changes all the time and the call to fetch it is not authenticated.What bothers you exactly ? FTFY Yep, to fetch the orderbook and compute their ticker buy and sell prices. I'm wondering whether what you are coding is a standalone exchange, or an additional layer on top of existing exchanges. I'm talking about fraud, not AML That's quite retarded, why would you need to get identification for withdrawals that are under the AML limits ?Incoming wires can come from phished accounts, but outgoing transfers ? How are these vulnerable to fraud ? This You don't plan on piggy-backing on another exchange for margin trading liquidity ? Nice ! It's resolved now, balances have been corrected and instant update is operational again Hello all,We encountered an issue that prevented funds from properly showing up in Instawallets, the issue has been solved and everyone should now have their exact balance restored.Technical details :Instawallet consists of : - an application layer (a Rails web-app), - A node app (used for instant balance updates through a websocket connection) - A bitcoin daemonEach of these parts is automatically and permanently monitored.What happened was that the bitcoin daemon died unexpectedly, it was then promptly restarted by the monitoring system, but the connection between the bitcoin layer and the application layer was not re-established, funds were then received and sent as usual, but incoming transactions didn't get properly linked to their Instawallets.My sincere apologies to everyone that was impacted by this glitch. this With 1:1 leverage you can let the customer have a 100% loss basically.With 10:1 leverage, you need to force-liquidate the position as soon as there is a small price movement in the opposite direction of the postion in order to *at least* get the amount that was loaned. The house reimburses itself and the customer loses everything. Are there any fees for anonymous transactions?The base fee for anonymous transactions is 1.5% fee + 0.0002 BTC miners' fee.From what I understand the bonus is for ppl who provide clean coins to the mixer There is a fee for anonymizing. This. Also please let the trolls die. A part of me boils with nerd rage when I see some retarded things written about Ruby or Rails but I refrain from answering because it's a pure loss of time.Yes, this is a concern for me. I don't care if floats are only used for display purposes (and not storage), but it starts bothering me when I see them everywhere as a sign of developer lazyness. That pretty much sums it all up I deal with the Instawallet shared wallet, which is probably an order of magnitude larger than Intersango's, and yes, it takes a little while to boot up, but when it's done it runs fine and smooth.Now that I think about it, it might be that they're using the 'accounts' feature of bitcoind, which scales terribly. So guys, protip, use a monitortx patch and let bitcoind notify your backend, just poll the client to update confirmation counts once it notifies you of an incoming block. Of course the Bitcoinica name would be changed for a clone to come online, but first I want to : - finish the reverse-engineering completely (which means understand every subtlety in the algorithms), - understand exactly how it can be properly monitored (the business side, not the technical side), - do an actual security audit (the things I tweaked already were pretty obvious, now I need to go more in depth), - have a solid plan for a GLBSE IPO, - have a plan for the C&D letter case, - start writing my own platform (because the code is not written in a maintainable way, and because I'd have a good incentive to write a fuckton of tests)
I suggest making sure you're not solvent  Maybe you should reduce the font size to save disk space.I guess even "marginally more secure" is always good to take with the Bitcoin Consultancy  I'm interested in the semantics, not the aesthetics. LOL No, it should work just fine.Just e-mail the support with a bit details because it isn't very clear for me right now. You can always wire your pounds to bitcoin-central and trade the euro market  You should change your card image, The PAN can't start with 5 for a Visa, it should be Mastercard  nice No, you'll probably need to scroll down for FB to lazy load the content so you can search for it in the page. Question : what is, according to you, the most secure payment method.https://www.facebook.com/kasperskylabfrance Meh Thank you! See this, that's the platform running BC. The layout (of BC) will be updated soon to match closely Paytunia's and this same info will be available directly from BC. But hey, nice catch Oh, and you'll get our CNIL declaration number too.No matter what you manage to dig up, my point still stands, this effort would be better used updating the wiki than some biodegradable forum thread. FTFY Update the wiki if you want your work to be useful to others. Because it would generate profits that could be, at least partially, allocated to the compensation of the victims.That was my original idea.I'm not sure however that I like the way Bitcoinica actually works (based on my first analysis of the actual matching code see http://pastie.org/4257541) but the reverse engineering task is not finished yet. Started thoroughly studying the trading part, here's my understanding of the trade matching code.My comments start with "D :", there are like 2 comments made by ZThttp://pastie.org/4257541 The more I read the code, the more I see it is very very messy. I think the reason they'd want to rewrite it from scratch would have been for maintenability, not security. It's not possible.But what you can do is repeat the same few steps with different shared wallets or even simpler, just use SR. Use Instawallet through Tor. You can see for yourself using blockexplorer that it gets mixed nicely.
I'd love a C&D notice, I'd publish it here so people know on which door they should knock to get their money back  brb getting server Try Bitcoin-Central, shoudn't be much harder to get money in there Disclaimer : I operate BC as part of the Paymium company, my position being CTO I LOL'd Oh, and BTW, if someone actually contacts me with a C&D notice we'll know who actually owns the IP  In fact, even though the code doesn't seem very secure it is still a fact that the only flaws that led to the thefts were organizational and not technical. As far as I'm concerned I downloaded code from someone who voluntarily published it, and there are no copyright notices anywhere in it.    Interesting.My understanding is that they did not require credit checks on people because they would reimburse themselves by force-liquidating your position once it was getting close to net_worth = borrowed_amountIn my understanding how it works is the following (haven't checked much in the actual code so far) : - For a short position you borrow BTC from the house. If your own BTCs are N your leverage 2, you end up with selling 2*N BTC at price P1, you're now holding 2*N*P1 USD, if price falls to P2 you can liquidate your position with a buy order, you buy (2*N*P1)/P2 BTC. If P1 > P2 you get keep a profit, if P1 < P2 you're at a loss. Your position is force-liquidated when P2 rises so much that re-buying would leave just enough to reimburse the house. - For a long position it's pretty much the opposite. You're just shorting the USD.And since (always in my understanding) you liquidate positions with market orders there is always enough to pay profits.People can approach this as gambling, or trading, doesn't matter, as long as the rule is clear I see no malice in that. BUT my understanding of margin trading concepts is still fairly limited, I'm genuinely curious about it, and ready to stand corrected. cyanide Yep, so that's basically a non-issue  How was the pricing algo an invention ?From what I thought I understood it was simply the mtgox price at a certain depth. Doesn't mean it's desirable  From my understanding there are actual trades happening when users place orders, if they have a long position actual BTCs are bought for example.I'm not really far in understanding how it actually works, until then, calling it a bucket shop (or a legitimate trading platform for the matter) is IMO a little premature. Understood, if you want to read the business logic it is in the app/models folder (each model is linked to a database table), and in the app/workers folder (this one contains all the periodic running tasks) the pricing logic probably resides in one of the workers.I don't think it would be extremely difficult, Ruby is awesome for this kind of things, you can transparently replace code at runtime.See pastebin belowI've added a couple comments, but this is pretty much the raw TickingJob http://pastebin.com/4Ej858a8I love it, and JetBrains gave me a free open-source license for developing Bitcoin-Central.net  I can assure you this one is. The IDE is Rubymine, it's the bomb.If you're a Rails coder you won't have much trouble getting it running, you basically need to install the dependencies with bundler, launch a couple moving parts (bitcoin client, redis, resque, clockwork) and you're all set. Oh, and you need to create a MtGox API key and feed it to the code. With the leak of the code I'm asking myself whether it would be a good idea to setup a bitcoinica clone.Pros :Would make some good moneyThere is demand for gambling margin tradingHalf the profits could go to the people who lost money because of Bitcoin Consultancy/Bitcoinica/[insert scapegoat here]The app itself has never been broken into (even though it's quite surprising when reading the code)Cons :Needs moar reverse-engineering/fixingNeeds moar testing...Thoughts ? I've just started a technical document aimed at describing the way the bitcoinica codebase works, how the trading works and how one could potentially setup a clone. Feel free to help !It's all here haha oh god, no
Probably mtgox codes used at other exchanges. Well then, why not include anonymization network X or Y ?I say do one thing and do it well. but your point sounds about right I don't want no tor in my bitcoin client, I don't want it to brew coffee either. Your assumption is incorrect It uses the bitcoiner gem which is my code (extracted from bitcoin-central) packaged by someone I don't know as a ruby gem C'est exactement ca.Quand le prix de l'ask le moins cher est en dessous du bid le plus cher alors un échange se produit.Pour ce qui est de refaire un ordre plus cher, pourquoi pas, mais ça c'est à toi de voir  The API keys *were* revoked. lol I haven't gotten there yet.Took a bit of time to get every moving part in place to have it actually running. Nice!Do you have hooks for integrating other APIs ? Additionally the app itself has never been hacked (which is a little surprising ) It would be pointless to write this in the wiki, all the Rails security basics are widely available online.If you want your app to be secure it's not the lack of information that's in the way. Count me in baby Do you have an IRC chan? A hashtag? Hmm, I wouldn't really make a web page about it but if someone maintains a dedicated list I'm ok being listed.As for the price it would depend on the context, and on my available time I'm ok with that You can't judge an app on that, tests mean you're protecting yourself against regressions.The app was written in 4 days, I think it is an impressive piece of work despite a couple major security flaws I identified by simply having a quick look.Rails gives you the infrastructure to easily write them since day one. But they don't just write themselves The real facepalm flaw is the fact that production passwords are stored in the code itself. This is plain wrong.You're effectively giving the github (or whatever source control system you use) access to all funds at all times.And it's fucking trivial to get right, just make a deploy hook to copy the production configuration files from the production server, to the production server. I can audit any Rails app. But I'm expensive I run bitcoin-central.net which hasn't suffered a single security issue since it started operating in december 2010, and this despite the source being open for all to see. Here you go : http://pastebin.com/AMrABK66The good thing is that what genjix posted contains a full git repository, meaning we see can all the different ToS versions. Zhou I'm going through your code as we speak, gives me contradicting feelings : - you made a really good app, in an original way, but - your code is dirty and some parts are really insecure (:otp_required in attr_accessible? I don't think so.)But still, kudos for making such a cool app with original features! (and also kudos to giving back some of your profits to people who lost money in the whole bitcoinica thing) 
Hahaha, no Yeah, please don't do that, additionnaly calling others names does nothing but make you look like an idiot. Everyone fucks up, we're all humans, you gave lots.If I can help you in any way let me know privately. En fait c'est très simple, vous fixez le prix maximum auquel vous souhaitez acheter, disons pour l'exemple 7.Vous placez votre ordre, vous rentrez la quantité que vous voulez ainsi que votre prix maximum. Par exemple si vous souhaitez acheter 10 BTC avec un prix maximum à 7 votre ordre sera exécuté en achetant en priorité les BTC les moins chers (donc les 2 que vous mentionnez), il ne restera plus que 8 BTC à acheter pour compléter votre ordre ils seront donc "mangés" sur l'ordre suivant qui fait 50 BTC.Après l'exécution de votre ordre d'achat, l'ordre de vente de 2 BTC aura disparu et il ne restera que 42 BTC sur l'ordre de vente initialement à 50.Concernant les prix auxquels se font les échanges ils se feront au prix de vente dans votre cas puisque c'est vous qui placez l'ordre en dernier. Donc vous acheterez 2 BTC à un certain prix puis les 8 autres à un prix un peu plus élevé.Si votre ordre ne peut pas être satisfait en entier (si par exemple vous achetez 1000 BTC) il restera un ordre d'achat actif qui sera exécuté à votre prix d'achat maximum.(n'utilisez pas l'option 'Market' pour les ordres à moins d'avoir exactement compris ce à quoi cela correspond par contre)N'hésitez-pas si ce n'est pas encore tout à fait clair  I'm not sure about the mobilism store but the APK is now available directly at https://paytunia.com/paytunia.apk I honestly feel sorry for all the people that lost, and keep losing money because of this.I also feel very sorry for all the operators and the Bitcoin Consultancy, errors can have disastrous consequences, we're all humans, we all fuck up eventually.I wish everyone that is impacted gets out of this with minimum suffering and stress. Let's leave the advanced tips for when the basics have been understood  See https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-central to see how you properly store production passwords.protip : not directly in the fucking source code The theft was authenticated using an API token that doesn't require a second authentication factor. That's by design, otherwise APIs wouldn't be able to work in an automated fashion.On the other you can set specific constraints on what the API can do (if you authenticate with an API token you do not necessarily have the same access rights/limits as the ones you have when authenticating with a username+password+2nd factor)EDIT : Oh wait, I misread, it indeed went through the username+password authentication. I don't have words to describe the sheer amounts of fail this represents and how easily it could have been prevented.  Never experienced that, even on Instawallet's bitcoind, and this one handles some decent load  That's not exactly how I define "better".I don't know. I'm still going to try instead of looking for reasons not to  I highly doubt MtGox has an actual legal duty to do so since they are not regulated as a financial operator.They can still comply with regulations they are not legally subjected to, and IMO it is a good thing since we all want the bitcoin trading industry to gain a better legal recognition. And the first step to do so is to honestly acknowledge that, as of today, we all operate in a completely gray area with high legal risk and uncertainty. These apply to properly registered financial providers. Not a plain company running in a gray area with a polish bank account.See this. I would totally donate a few coins for an Armory port to Ruby He isn't very active on the forums, but I think that if he had some advice to give to you it would be : "don't".The actual code that runs the exchange is the easy relaxing part. The hard part is all the rest.Code = easyDealing with banks, accounting, security, customers, taxation, lawyers, monitoring, automation = hard & stressfulMake a solid plan and leave the code thing as the last thing you'll do.And I don't have time to provide personalized code-level support to potential competition  Bitcoin exchanges are not Facebook.You can't just delete all the information that is linked to your account without messing up the accounting.And if transactions remain they have to be linked to an account  IIRC you can receive coins but you can't yet spend them on a multisig address using the stock client.I'm very interested in using multisig too. Reinventing the wheel ? monit baby
Oh god, who made you a mod ? also  I lol'd so hard when checking his website out.People, just don't do business with Bruce Wagner. While you're at it you may want to fix your e-mail validation, it thinks my username+filter@gmail.com address isn't valid. +100I'm sure he gets a very fair compensation for his trouble  Haha, you managed to leave the part I'm raging about. I shall not rage about it anymore. Additionnally I'll add this information calculated field on Bitcoin Central's transactions display since it sounds like a good idea that can't really hurt. I won't argue with you, the idea of having a final balance along each transaction is not a bad idea in itself. It just doesn't add anything when it's done the right way and calculated from the strict minimum stored data (namely the amount). It is (or should be) calculated data.If an exchange does not provide you with your full transaction history, that is incomplete information. So, without arguing on the usefulness or desirability of a "final balance" displayed amount, I maintain that your title is misleading. The way the data is stored internally is irrelevant. The information that is provided to you with or without a "final balance" attribute is the exact same. If an exchange adds a column giving you, for each transaction, the square root of the transacted amount it doesn't convey any additional information. The same information is just presented in a different way.You want exchanges to save you the trouble of firing up Excel to get this final balance, not provide you with more information. This is why your title is misleading. Your title is misleading.What you're complaining about is that some exchanges present their data in a way you don't like, but not that there is actually information that's missing. Wrong.IsStandard is not a sanity check, it's a DOS protection.A transaction is either valid or not, it has nothing to do with being "standard" in the IsStandard check semantics. C'est maintenant corrigé.On communiquera dessus un peu plus tard, parce qu'on va avoir beaucoup de choses en plus sur lesquelles communiquer  Vous êtes mal renseigné, la norme SEPA n'impose pas de tarification particulière. Ces 15 EUR correspondent à la commission prélevée par la Rietumu pour un virement sortant en EUR en économique (crédit à J+1). Le ask est un peu au dessus de MtGox tout simplement parce qu'il y a moins de liquidité.On est en train de vraiment travailler ce point particulier en offrant des conditions plus attractives aux vendeurs. Auparaavant, ces derniers devaient supporter une commission de 15 pour tout virement sortant, en changeant de banque nous avons ramené la commission à 0.99.Par ailleurs nous sommes en train de développer des outils d'arbitrage automatique : en clair ca veut dire que la liquidité sera bien meilleure pour tout le monde, des deux côtés du spread.On vous encourage à le faire, il y a des opportunités d'arbitrage intéressantes et vous donnerez de la liquidité aux acheteurs. Usually happens to MySQL when the partition it sits on is full.  http://xkcd.com/703/ Yes and physical identification.Apparently it became much harder to open a bank account in the US after 9/11 Apparently it is not possible to open an account these days without being resident. badum-tssss I meant 19 pages, I find only 17 pages, with 10 links per page it gives 170 wallet URLs, my point still stands. Google indexes stuff that people publish, it does not do black magic.
You don't really need to have bitcoins on your personal computer to pay someone. Bitcoin-Central is also usable as a wallet.When you have bitcoins on your Bitcoin-Central.net account you can download the Paytunia application for Android and pay directly from your mobile phone.Or you can simply send bitcoins to a merchant by putting the payment address directly in Bitcoin-Central's withdrawal form. Assertion 1 :Your search yields approximately 19 URLs.There are over 250,000 different wallets at Instawallet.Assertion 2 :Google does not magically index hidden wallet URLs.Make your conclusions.  Opening a bank account for a non-resident would be possible, but you'd probably have to visit the bank in person. ben je pensais à hushmail.je vois pas trop l'intérêt de proposer ca en fait Ca existe déjà. +1, instawallet FTW I'm not sure about how the footer looked like when you posted your message, but now it says "Paymium".Also if you use Instawallet on a regular basis and have an iPhone you'll want to download our iOS app  I'm not sure about such a feature.What makes Instawallet's strength is that it is extremely simple and straightforward. I think it is better to focus on core functionality (and add push notifications for balance updates, improve the scanning part...), keep the app simple and extremely reliable. We're waiting for some more downloads, and a few more bugfixes to bundle into our next build before pushing an update. Oui, vous pouvez disposer de vos BTC comme bon vous semble. Je persiste, un virement bancaire n'est pas annulable sauf accord du destinataire. Les virements ne peuvent pas être annulés. When I get that it usually means that the key is already present in the wallet.Try removeprivkey and then reimport. I never said there were no logs kept.Any incentive to remain honest for a hidden service collecting bitcoins instantly disappears when they see that their customer holdings exceed the revenue they could expect from fees over X years.Go for it, I'll happily pass. Interesting, I'm not sure about the fact that it is that important to insist on mobile devices directly speaking the bitcoin protocol, but what I'm sure is that diverse opinions and point of views are a good thing  Tout me plaît sauf le dépôt de cash  Certes c'est entre les Facebook credits, Buyster, Kwixo et consorts mais ca me fait déjà chaud au coeur !http://www.lefigaro.fr/conso/2012/06/14/05007-20120614ARTFIG00693-le-smartphone-revolutionne-le-paiement-en-ligne.php Have fun burning battery while you're downloading the satoshi dice history Bonjour,Bitcoin-Central.net change de banque entre autres afin de réduire les frais liés aux virements SEPA sortants. Pour mémoire la Rietumu (banque Lettone et non Lituanienne) facturait 15 par virement sortant.Cela nous permettra de proposer une commission sur cashout largement inférieure à ce que nous étions en mesure de proposer auparavant. Cela nous amènera plus de vendeurs, donc plus de liquidité, donc, in fine, des cours plus avantageux pour les acheteurs.La charte a toujours été présente, elle a simplement été mise à jour pour refléter les obligations à laquelle, nous, en tant que société légalement constituée, sommes soumis.Fournir une copie de pièce d'identité permettrait de lever les nouveaux plafonds liés à nos obligations. Ceci dit, si vous restez en dessous des plafonds que nous avons documentés nous ne vous demanderons pas de pièce d'identité. Dans votre cas précis votre compte est connu, nous n'avons jamais eu de problème de demande de retour de virement avec vous.Les plafonds restents relativement larges pour des achats personnels : 250 par opération, 3 opérations par mois, 750 par mois, et 8000 par an. En clair, vous pouvez acheter pour 8000 par an sur Bitcoin-Central sans qu'on vous demande quoi que ce soit.Comprenez-bien que ce n'est pas par plaisir que nous mettons ces mesures en place mais par nécessité de nous protéger en tant qu'entreprise et de protéger vos fonds en tant que client.Prenons un exemple simple, sur de nouveaux comptes, le cas s'est déjà produit de voir le compte Rietumu bloqué à la suite d'un virement pour lequel un retour à l'expéditeur a été demandé. Cela peut se produire quand des identifiants d'accès à une banque en ligne sont compromis. Dans ce cas nous avons du produire des preuves de livraison effective des bitcoins afin d'avoir notre compte débloqué suite à notre refus de retour à l'envoyeur. Avoir des mesures de connaissance du client pour les nouveaux comptes est une protection pour tout le monde.Enfin, sachez que si vous refusez de nous fournir ces documents suite à un virement dépassant les plafonds, contrairement à mtgox nous retournerions simplement le virement à l'expéditeur (donc à vous). Nous avons certains plafonds en place certes, mais nous n'avons pas à geler d'avoirs simplement parce que vous avez dépassé le plafond et que vous ne souhaitez-pas fournir de documents d'identification.En espérant vous retrouver sur Bitcoin-Central! Well, the app has been available for a while now it's just that given all what's happening with them we'd rather want have as many people as possible install it *now* 
I fail to understand how it's different, send coins to Instawallet, withdraw coins half an hour later, you won't get the same coins since it's a shared wallet.Repeat this step with a second shared wallet, in another country preferably => coins cleaned. And all this without handing your coins to a onion service that could instantly disappear with all the users funds. You just need to open the wallet, it will update.Works fine with me, what are your iOS/iPhone versions ? Wut, David Birch that was speaking at the European Bitcoin conference ? Didn't know he had anything to do with MintChip Connect to these services through Tor ?Moving coins to and from silk road is a quite original way to get clean coins...Your service is quite irrelevant since going directly to any big shared wallet through Tor pretty much achieves the same thing.  It is not a viable indeed, fortunately that is not our strategy. Fixed, thanks for reporting. We apologise for the inconvenience kthxbye  There is only one full iPhone wallet available on the AppStore, and it's FriendlyPay<keynote parody>It downloads right on your iPhone, it's easy, it receives and sends like never before !It sits on Instawallet and it's gorgeous !</keynote parody> Site hosted on TOR ? Trying to collect BTC to "launder" them...Sounds legit. Sounds like it could disappear any minute without customers having any recourse.Protip : if you want to launder coins, mix them with *clean* coins, not other tainted coins And use a service that has enough coins in its shared wallet fot it to actually work. You are correct, however the trust models are quite different for the official client versus a JS wallet.The official client's code is extensively peer-reviewed and enables multiple different developers to check for the binary hash consistence.A JS wallet dynamically serves code to you, it opens a LOT more possibilities.A bitcoin developer cannot wake up one morning and decide he'll steal funds from already installed clients. A JS wallet operator has a variety of options if he wants to do that. I stand by my words. I don't see how spreading the balance among multiple addresses would make the security model any stronger when they're stored in the same bank safe. But that's just my 25000 BTC. Plus I really like the transparency that it provides.I'm stating precise facts. If a JS wallet operator wakes up one day and decides to steal your funds, he has a variety of options to pick from depending on whether he cares about getting caught or not, whether he has time on his hands or not etc. I think reminding this simple fact is a quite responsible attitude actually, because I believe that people tend to forget it or were never aware of it in the first place.Stating a fact does not imply making a judgement one way or another.If you think you do not need to trust the operator of a JS wallet when you use it, then you need to think again. It's not sensationalist, it's not an opinion, it's not a comparison, it's just a fact. It doesn't mean JS wallets are good, bad, better than X or worse than Y, it's just something that I wanted to remind to people who have an interest in JS wallets. Are you ok with a thorough KYC procedure ? That's hardly a security issue since it gets transmitted with HTTPS. Yes, as you say cold storage doesn't make sense on JS wallets.I'm impressed by the code monitoring setup you advertise.But I disagree on the safest option to store coins. The safest is to use a full client or light client (light client that doesn't get served any code whatsoever). That's the only way to not have to trust anyone. What I mean by cold storage is using offline addresses.Typically, the minimum possible is left on the server to reduce the consequences of a theft, should the server ever be compromised.It requires monitoring to either send excess funds to cold storage, or reload the server if the amount of withdrawals largely exceeds the amount of deposits.When your cold storage address is public, you cannot lie about getting hacked in order to steal user funds for yourself. You can only lie about a hack and steal the funds that are in the hot wallet.The same way, in the JS wallet model, an operator can claim having been hacked in order to steal a percentage of the funds using client-side code poisoning.In both cases, a rogue operator can steal a percentage of the funds by claiming that a hack occurred. Interesting.An hosted wallet operator can hardly claim the cold-storage was hacked when the address is public (see 1frtknx for instawallet's)This one can be turned around : "hey, with a hosted wallet you don't even need to back your wallet up, it's taken care of for you"I'm not very familiar with iOS's sandboxing model, but I would hardly trust a jailbroken phone to keep my data secure. Hey, now you even have to trust the Cydia guys too!Additionnally I tried to install the app from Cydia but I fails to start, which is a pity because it really looks great and I'd most definitely be willing to try/use it.Very nice but irrelevant to the topic.Theoretically that's a good point, but that means you'd have to compare the Github source against what you actually download. Regarding iOS/Android it doesn't change much when it comes to trusting the operator because you're usually installing a binary that has been compiled beforehand.That's very good but irrelevant because you still have to trust the operator to actually deploy the published code.I'm not sure I fully understand the implications. But I guess it wouldn't change much in case of compromised client-side code.  That's a good point.It's not about trust in a person. It's about trust in a model.My point is that the model behind client-side JS wallets also requires some trust in the wallet operator, whereas I often hear and read that they require none. If the operator of a JS wallet wants to get away with user funds and doesn't care about his reputation, he can get a good share of them. Yes it's harder than for the operator of a hosted wallet, but it's doable if you collect private keys over a few days. If the operator claims he got hacked he can only get a small fraction of the funds, which is true for hosted wallets too when the cold-storage is public. Interesting, but it would IMHO make more sense to install wallet as a signed extension, instead of installing an extension that checks that wallet isn't poisoned with rogue code. Maybe I'm missing something here  han, I guess you're right It's quite shameful though to beg for tips when you're not the author of the work. 
zed shaw is the man Let me reword it : "using a JS wallet requires trusting the wallet operator too".You have to trust that : - their servers are secure so the code won't get poisoned,  - they've actually implemented the security measures that you rightfully mention, - more importantly : that they're honestWhich, IMHO makes it not that different from a hosted wallet. Additionally, some counter-measures cannot be implemented natively in a JS wallet, for example cold-storage.If your JS wallet server gets broken in, a carefully timed attack could steal a very large percentage of the user funds unless the code monitoring you mention is implemented and the operator is reactive. With a hosted wallet you can only steal a fixed percentage of the funds.Obviously it all depends on a lot of factors as you said, my point simply being that it's not a simple black and white situation as often depicted. This is true for all wallets that advertise in-browser cryptography.They are all vulnerable to code-poisoning when the central server gets compromised.To properly do javascript cryptography you need to publish a signed browser extension that therefore doesn't get served dynamically and therefore is invulnerable to server-side code-poisoning.Basically, that means that blockchain.info, strongcoin.com, {insert client-side JS wallet here} is inherently less safe than a standalone client, and not much safer than a hosted wallet.Thoughts welcome ! Fixed.Thank you for reporting  interesting You can send funds from FriendlyPay Turn the question around, why would someone do that ? In their own terms "it's up to you to figure out".What would be better is reference some lawyer advice and assert that it is legal. The developer chooses in which jurisdictions apps are to be made available. And how would you do that mr security expert ?  No, we got the same answer from Apple. We're using the appeal process, for the second time, we got stonewalled the first time.We're not excluding a lawsuit since, as paying customers (developer licenses are not free) we believe we are entitled to either : - get told where the legal issue resides, - OR get an official developer guidelines update explicitly stating that Bitcoin is not cool on the AppStore (which would mean lots of press!) In pure shell : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=11606.0 That's actually a pretty common problem that doesn't denote a flaw, the certificate is probably valid. It's mostly just Firefox being picky. That is exactly what happened, sorry about that.The error happened because there weren't enough hot-wallet funds to perform your withdrawal.The hot wallet has been topped-up. Montoring Have a good one too! <3 That's exactly what I did to create this wallet, I took a big bunch of keys, imported them all, and then let the client download/scan the chain. I very strongly suspect the issue is somehow related to imported keys (as opposed to those generated directly by the client).That can happen when the site is down for maintenance, bitcoind receives the coins, but the part where it notifies the backend DB doesn't work. What I usually do in these cases is force a rescan of the events that happened during the time the backend was offline.Thank god most people aren't like the person posting this reddit thread and don't start spreading FUD if don't get an instantaneous reply from the support. I do not, the balance reported by "getbalance '*' 1" is much bigger than what getbalance reports (the calls should theoretically be equivalent), that means the transactions counted have at least one conf.It's logical that "getbalance '*' 0" reports a bigger balance than "getbalance '*' 1" though.Update is irrelevant, rescan was done long before I even thought about posting on the forums, using a new wallet implies that I can transfer the coins which the client won't let me do since it will check what I try to send against getbalance (it won't let me transfer all the coins) I'll bounty 2 BTC for a workaround and 10 BTC for a fix. Code:$ ./bitcoin getinfo{    "version" : 60099,    "protocolversion" : 60000,    "walletversion" : 60000,    "balance" : 698.57338016,    "blocks" : 180489,    "connections" : 8,    "proxy" : "",    "difficulty" : 1733207.51384839,    "testnet" : false,    "keypoololdest" : 1337242670,    "keypoolsize" : 1001,    "paytxfee" : 0.00000000,    "errors" : "URGENT: upgrade required, see http://bitcoin.org/dos for details"}$ ./bitcoin getbalance698.57338016$ ./bitcoin getbalance '' 02883.11218472$ ./bitcoin getbalance '' 12413.11218472$ ./bitcoin listaccounts{    "" : 2413.11218472}$ ./bitcoin getbalance '*' 02883.11218472$ ./bitcoin getbalance '*' 12413.11218472Ok, so what I conclude is the following : there is apparently a bug in getbalance (called without additional arguments), that prevents it from reporting the correct balance. I assume that calling getbalance and passing an account yields the correct balances (I track them separately in a RDBMS).Since I don't use accounts getbalance '' X and getbalance '*' X logically yield the same result.This is very frustrating, if it is confirmed to be a bug in bitcoind (I suspect it's linked with this bug) then I think its priority should be bumped a fair bit since it prevents sending valid funds.Any insight, idea or suggestion from the friendly Bitcoin community will be very appreciated!
I did rescan a couple of times already, and I'm using the getbalance command correctly. But thank you for showing some interest, it is appreciated EDIT : Using listaccounts is a good suggestion actually, gives some more insight, results posted below Code:$ ./bitcoin getinfo{    "version" : 60099,    "protocolversion" : 60000,    "walletversion" : 60000,    "balance" : 62.10626016,    "blocks" : 180481,    "connections" : 8,    "proxy" : "",    "difficulty" : 1733207.51384839,    "testnet" : false,    "keypoololdest" : 1337234612,    "keypoolsize" : 1001,    "paytxfee" : 0.00000000,    "errors" : "URGENT: upgrade required, see http://bitcoin.org/dos for details"}(Gonna do the upgrade later, don't think it has anything to do with my problem.)Code:$ ./bitcoin getbalance '*' 01810.91340447$ ./bitcoin getbalance '*' 11776.64506472The correct value should be the one that getbalance yields.What could be happening here ?? This is driving me seriously crazy. He understands perfectly well. He's just saying that blockchain.info is a really really good wallet, but it just isn't a one-size-fits-all solution.The point is that non-hosted wallets rely entirely on the user backing everything up properly, not forgetting their passwords, not getting a virus infection on their device etc. If that's what a user requires it's perfectly respectable, but that comes at the price of some convenience.(Oh, and if you were planning on mentioning e-mail backups remember that e-mail accounts are most of the time... hosted ) Y a clairement de quoi faire un truc hebdomadaire Yes. But that's ok. You are fast to judge. Nobody needs to be hated. However we sometimes need to ignore some people and feel sorry for them that they're unable to be friendly to others. Because if you're mean, angry, and hateful towards others, chances are you're not being very peaceful inside. You don't have to tolerate insults to protect what free speech is about. Moi je serais plutôt partisan de quelque chose d'hebdomadaire quitte à ce que ce soit un peu plus court. Il se passe tellement de trucs... Je passe personnellement une grosse partie de mon temps à faire de la veille sur les forums, et encore je manque plein de trucs. Being responsible for heaps of cash is a very stressful thing. Interesting.I'm still curious about how MultiBit manages to send coins if it can't do the scripting magic.But hey, thanks for clearing some stuff up! I'm keeping an eye on bitcoinjs it uses nodejs so it'll easily scale, libbitcoin is very promising too Yes Multibit (Java)Armory (Python)Bitcoinjs (Server-side JS)How are these clients failing to fully implement the protocol ? How are these clients even remotely relying on a Satoshi client "backend" ?GUIs don't provide functionality, they provide an interface to a core (or backend, whatever you want to call it) which in turn provides functionality. There are multiple clients that do not use the same core as the Satoshi client. Please explain to me how, say MultiBit for the sake of the argument, uses a Satoshi backend.libbitcoin is very cool, I like the project, but it is an implementation among others that doesn't have anything unique AFAIK. (except maybe for the fully asynchronous architecture, but I think bitcoinjs has that too) Doesn't make sense. Lots of clients exist in a variety of languages, some of them functionnally exceed the Satoshi client. And most of them don't "use the Satoshi code base as it's back end".You could hardly be more condescending.What exactly do you call the bitcoin codbase ? The Satoshi client ? Last time I checked libbitcoin's code wasn't in there.Don't get me wrong, libbitcoin is awesome. But this :is simply not true What about all the other clients ? Aren't they complete as well ? Great info ! They are definitely not allowed to do that. It's good that you're publishing all this.I have a question, do you intend to publish the source code in one way or another ? I'd love to take a look at it   (as a pro Rails developer) Your app looked really good, a pity that some much trouble comes from infrastructure/admin issues. Excellent, fonce!
Not sure if serious... This If you're not in charge, maybe the person who actually is should communicate. /dev/null This theft is not a bug, it's a feature. le hurr, le durr. Haha, headshot I know exactly what I'm doing, I'm using the official (with a couple of patches) bitcoind. It's painful in some respects but much more mature than any other client. I think it is a very good idea that would open lots of possibilities. lame comment is lame  +1 Whoops! https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=81045.0 What exactly are you talking about ? What's also possible is that they pulled it because they felt a loophole was used to get the app on the AppStore in the first place.Their terms forbid apps to make e-currencies buyable in apps. Nothing is said regarding sending/receiving it.(but the whole e-currency thing is irrelevant since we all know Bitcoin is not an e-currency) You should explain exactly what you want. N'hésite-pas à aller faire une tour sur bitcoin-central.net pour en acheter simplement par virement quand tu en auras marre d'attendre que quelqu'un veuille bien t'en vendre pour du PP  I managed to get rid of the ugly DRM.http://dl.dropbox.com/u/52452135/Les%20temps%20hypermodernes.epubhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/52452135/Occident%20mondialis%C3%A9.epub Ugh, just bought them to realize they're full of DRM. You'll need to use Adobe Digital editions to read them. No, because of the way Instawallet works.
YepThat part's not true though, they have awesome products (IMO obviously). What sucks is their close-everything attitude (and also Objective C).They can't indeed, but native apps can scan QR codes and use push notifications which are must-haves.(And don't tell me you can scan QR codes using an external app, that just doesn't cut it )I'll communicate later regarding this statement, some apps of ours are still in the Apple pipeline.Chicken and egg problem ... Non, tous les noeuds voient toutes les transactions, si une transaction t'est destinée ton noeud le verra parce qu'elle est destinée à ton adresse.Un peu comme si tu voyais tous les emails passer en étant capables de décrypter uniquement ceux qui te sont adressés. I don't know why, but they clearly say that an app that allows Bitcoins to be used is not OK. Ok, here's my address : 1DavouTAsveznCFHsz688xvbrRAq4u2qm8 Ok, 3.5 BTC sounds good to you ? (I'd have to pay approx. 12 EUR) Search yields two results, which one do you want, epub version ? I don't think they ever did. I can't seem to find it anymore. Can someone find it ? Yeah, no big surprise knowing how it got there in the first place. It is a unique ID that has no link with the private key of the wallet address.That is how it is generated (Ruby) :Code:def set_key  if key.blank?    self.key = SecureRandom.base64(25).gsub(/[\+\=\/]/, '')  endend Intéressant, je ne suis pas vraiment familier du concept de PirateBox, qu'est-ce que c'est exactement ? (j'ai regardé un peu ton lien sans vraiment bien comprendre) watching Your address failed to validate against the Bitcoin client.Also your amount is wrong, it must be an integer value expressed in Satoshis. If you want to send 0.01 BTC you must send 0.01 * 10^8 (1000000). You got it ! A next version of the Satoshi client will actually let you pick which TX outs (which "from" addresses) you wish to use when sending coins. Instawallet addresses are static. It's a feature, the rationale being that it's extremely easy to get a new address by creating a new wallet.It also allows significant performance gains as the bitcoin client's "accounts" feature doesn't have to be used. (that was making the previous Instawallet really slow) Absolutely not FTFY You're fine.Shared wallets (like Instawallet) aren't compatible, that's by design. Ca ne concerne pas directement Bitcoin mais c'est quand-même très intéressant ! +1
As promised, we're now back on bitcoincharts.com Never rely on "From" address. It's like, the easiest thing to forge. kiba is looking for work, there's a thread, somewhere Interesting, prompted me to read this which really sums everything nicely up. +1 Bumpity bump.If someone had a pointer for this, would help me Hacking manually in the wallet.dat is totally acceptable. (I assume I'd need some sort of BDB CLI client) Gotcha Doesn't the TX get tagged with the account when using the sendfrom call ? What you're saying is that you create a new address like thisCode:$ bitcoin getnewaddress account-xxwhen you send funds to it, the "account" field in listtransactions is correctly populated, but when you send funds from the wallet the "account" field remains empty ?That sounds a little weird, how are you doing the send ? Like this ?Code:$ bitcoin sendfrom account-xx 1davout... 42.86 Try downclocking. Yes, there will be an API update ASAP in order to support it. The bank is the Rietumu bank, it's located in Latvia. To be honest I don't think that a zero-risk setup exists, if someone tells you something is  zero-risk you should pay even closer attention. If Japan starts frowning upon Bitcoin mtgox is dead. The main risk is if countries start to coordinate and hunt down Bitcoin exchanges one after one, in this case I don't think we'd be the first to fall.Also, if everything goes well and our efforts at Paymium are successful, we won't need it anymore because we'll be able to do business quietly and securely in a well-regulated framework. Not every country is the United-States I take responsibility for my actions, I setup everything in what, I and the people I consulted, believe is a legal way.If knowing that, the government still wants to go after me, I can't do much to stop them I guess, except for arguing that we've been honest, open and working jointly with the regulation authorities in order to come to a reasonable regulation framework. On the other hand, Bitcoin-Central.net is perfect for Germans, it's fast, and free. Let me elaborate on that, because that is a really important question.First of all, I if remember correctly the judge of the Tribunal de Commerce de Créteil ruled that the bank had a right to terminate the account because it was not used for its original purpose, which was to be the primary account for a tiny software development company called Macaraja (see previous link). Regarding Paytunia and Bitcoin-Central : Paytunia is a brand of a French company called Paymium that also operates Instawallet, I'm the CTO of Paymium. If you happen to be in Paris you're welcome to visit us in our office (metro Porte de Saint-Cloud) !Bitcoin-Central, on the other hand, legally is a service operated by Tivoli HK Ltd. which is a company incorporated in the Hong-Kong jurisdiction. Legally, what the Bitcoin-Central service is, is the simplest it could be :It buys a digital commodity called Bitcoin from individuals or corporations by crediting a client account, and performing actual payments upon request,It sells a digital commodity called Bitcoin from individuals or corporations who have pre-paid a certain amount of fiat currency,It does both of the previous things at the same time, which functionally makes it similar to a FOREX, but legally similar to an import/export businessPlease bear with me while I go back in time and give some context :When I started BC I accepted deposits on my personal bank account, this quickly proved to be suboptimal, my account balance pretty much exploded. I didn't want to put myself at risk of being rape-caged and fined, and I didn't want my users to be at risk of losing funds.So the next thing I thought was : "hey, there's lots of potential, let's incorporate properly". Problems started when the actual implemtation details had to be figured out. The first tough question was : "what is Bitcoin ?", because the answer to that is the prerequisite : to proper accounting, proper tax-payment, and ultimately avoidance of the dreaded rape-cage.Options were :Bitcoin is currency. That would have made things easy, opening a money-changing business is comparatively easy to the other options,Bitcoin is a commodity. Less easy, that would have meant incorporating as a proper commodity marketplace, which is really hard if you don't have the proper resources,Finally, the conservative and safe option was to treat Bitcoin as a generic virtual good/service. Awesome, that's easy to incorporate for, the blocking point was the Value Added Tax that is due for sales to individuals.VAT is the keyword, its one of the primary sources of income for the French government, so let me tell you that they take it *seriously*. What would the implications of VAT have been for someone who buys stuff from individuals and immediately sells it to others. It's pretty simple, it's 19.6%.Practically, that would have meant that users could sell coins for X, and BC would have had to resell the same coins immediately for (X * 1.196). Users would have had to pay an extra 20% in taxes to the French government to buy coins at Bitcoin-Central. Did not happen obviously.So we're coming to the Hong-Kong thing. Hong-Kong's legislation has a very interesting property, it has 0% VAT if you do business outside of Hong-Kong: perfect fit!That basically meant to me that I could incorporate a company in HK that would buy and sell a digital generic good/service free of taxes, without making risky assumptions regarding its legal nature. Opening a bank account in SEPA zone for a Hong-Kong corporation was a headache but ultimately succeeded (the hard part was always explaining Bitcoin ). This setup enables BC to do the following thing :Buy Bitcoins,Sell Bitcoins with 0% VAT without making risky legal assumptions,Provide users with the convenience of a SEPA zone accountThe main point here is : it's the most legally conservative, and safe setup I think is possible in Europe. Having less users, pay more to intermediates for a more complicated setup, and take the hard path is OK to me if that's what it takes to do business securely. My peace of mind has no price We think being open to users and curious people is a good thing, so if you have further questions, don't hesitate to ask here, or visit us for a cup of coffee  Haha, yeah that is so right, BC used to be there, but at some point they required the API to change which I hadn't time to do at that moment.It just got on top of my TODO  Yep, it is also my pleasure and passion I don't believe there is such a thing. But as long as you find somthing useful in them it's all good.Competition is healthy, if they like Intersango they ought to keep using them, that happens at BC as well, returning customers are the bulk of the volume.Imaginary information is convenient, isn't it ? BC is not making a killing, but it's definitely gaining customers <3 There's no such thing as free stuff, a bitcoiner should know that. What tells a lot about both of us are : our attitude, and our actions. One is contributing, working his ass off, investing his own money to actually get things moving. The other one knows so much better than the acting one and thinks he's so much smarter. 15 > 0, bravo Einstein!You might be surprised to learn that banks do not charge corporations and individuals the same way. You might be surprised to hear that not all banks want to service corporations that engage in the commerce of Bitcoins, because guess what, I'm open about it. I don't want to end up like mtgox in France, they used a bank account that was owned by a company making 45 as a yearly net profit[1] to make tens of thousands euros transit. The result was obviously a frozen account, angry users etc.Man up and use your hands instead of your mouth, you might realize it's actually harder to do stuff than it is to speak about it.References : [1] infogreffe.fr, search for "MACARAJA" in "Dénomination sociale, sigle ou nom" and look at the "Résultat" field Wanted to use multibit, gave up when I realized it thought it was smarter than me by not letting me set a 0 tx fee and instead insist on a 1 mBTC fee. Apparently it's a feature according to Jim :/ Get your facts straight : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area#MisconceptionsOur bank charges 15  for outgoing payments. We add exactly 0  on top of that. Get your math straight : That makes us the cheapest option by far for for middle to large sized withdrawals compared to exchanges who'll charge you a percentage of the amount (even though it's not harder to make a larger transfer, go figure). MD5 is weak, salts are probably stored in your DB, SHA2 is designed for speed which is precisely what *you do not want* in a password hash function, especially when half of this community is actively working on making SHA2 bruteforce more and more efficient Don't reinvent the wheel, use bcrypt, it was designed specifically for that use case, it is designed to be slow which is a good thing for a password hash function.
Or just a smug face on some random photograph if you're French. We get small volume for EUR. But I hear you, there's *ahem* room for improvement There've been a lot of behind-the-scenes improvements since BC isn't a hobby anymore but a professionnal endeavour!I'm working to integrate BitInstant as we speak, Ukash is next, after that the roadmap is as follows : - improve design and usability, - Merge LR with fiat (currently LREUR and EUR are separate markets, seemed like a good decision at the time but apparently users think it wasn't, and users are mostly right) - rewrite of the trading engine to make it execute trades against multiple other trading platforms (= virtually the combined liquidity of all other exchanges) - improvement of the merchant API to take advantage of the rewritten trading engine, with the bigger goal of providing the tightest spreads for merchant/buyer auto-exchangeOur code's been open since December 31 2010, not a single hack. I'll let you reach your own conclusions regarding the quality of the code The only exchange that's older than BC is mtgox (when Jed still operated it). So you can trust the fact that we're animated by passion and here to stay  Tu peux passer quand tu veux chez Paymium à la porte de St Cloud, je me ferai un plaisir d'en vendre pour du cash FTFY I imported a massive amount (~100K) of addresses that way.To import them fast I did the following :Removed blockchain filesLaunched the client with  -maxconnections=0Made sure it wasn't connecting to anyone so the block count remains zeroImported all the addresses almost instantly since there was nothing to rescanRelaunched the client and let it download the whole chain so it would scan everything properlyInstead of re-downloading the chain you can probably simply restore the blockchain files and force a rescan after all the addresses have been imported.Don't forget to issue a transaction that transfers the complete balance to the new wallet, otherwise you wont have all the balances that are stored on change addresses. We're working on alternate designs for Instawallet, dual-currency display will be part of it.Both are deluxe Paytunia is a more integrated approach, it integrates seamlessly with Bitcoin-Central.net, it gives you full account history and a bunch of additional features. It is mostly intended for long to medium term storage of funds, and mobile usage through the Android and iPhone app.Instawallet is focused on "just working", you visit it, *boom* you have a wallet, you can access it on the go with FriendlyPay (released on the AppStore, and soon on Google Play). It gives instant gratification, you send funds to it, it's updated immediately with a comforting cash-register sound. It's targeted to newcomers, and paranoid advanced users (it's very lightweight, making it perfectly suitable for Tor access).The big plan is to integrate these tools (and others to come) very tightly in order to provide a seamless experience for anyone who want to do business with Bitcoins or keep them as investment. There's gonna be more on all this soon  just teasing you <3 Paymium SAS owns Instawallet. I'm its CTO.If you want precise legal information and access to incorporation documents you can have a look on the official French company directory at infogreffe.fr XD The whois shows Jan as registrant, and shows Paymium as technical and admin contacts. Looks correct to me. Watchin' Previously these strings were passed as account names to the bitcoin client. And I think it's wiser not to trust the JSON-RPC API to properly sanitize everything in every possible edge case. I'm currently encountering a weird issue with Instawallet's bitcoind.It is a stock client with a TX/block monitoring patch, but without Jan's previous patches (green-address, zero fee). I have two invalid transactions in it : for some reason, two users trying to send funds generated what was seen by the network as an invalid transaction.They appear when doing a gettransaction <txid> against instawallets client, but they are nowhere else to be found (blockexplorer.com and blockchain.info)So it'd be really nice if someone could grep them out their debug.log to see what was wrong with them.And it'd be even nicer if someone could point me in the right direction to remove them from my client, I haven't tried a rescan because I don't think it would remove them.TX IDs are : - 7dae7272a356d1340d02a81690951e7323823b9f534da1c8b120acb08b106f4c - f0dd9c4847eb6dc0f7ddb021ab8a315fb2653b8d04ff2f39f3e62bce59951177 Yep, just replace SHA256 by bcrypt in my original idea and we're good to go  The point is not to protect users against themselves, I hate it when applications try to do that.The rationale behind it is to protect the backend against malicious input.That doesn't mean we can't create whatever custom wallet ID you desire for you (and for anyone who requests so) if it makes you happy  Yes. That's part of the security improvements. There is bitcoin-central.net that accepts SEPA EUR and doesn't charge any fees. Actually what was happening is that the requests would time out when the previous Instawallet was calling bitcoind.bitcoind is currently unable to handle requests concurrently due to the locking strategy it uses.So the only thing left to do was to delegate most of the handling to an SQL database, and only call the client when really needed.But of course, beefing the hardware up can't do much bad  And regarding the discussions about what would happen in the case Instawallet's service was to be discontinued here's what we would do :A notice would be posted a long time in advance,We would generate a private key for each account, in a publicly documented way, using the wallet URL as seed,We'd compute the public key from the private key,We'd compute the address from the public key,We'd send the balance to this generated address,And that's it!Now all you'd need to regain control of your coins is to follow the steps using your wallet key, you'll get a private key you can import into any client, or into any service.Even a user without any technical knowledge could use a third-party service that could perform these steps given a wallet URL, for a fee obviously, but in perfect market conditions, therefore the fee would always be as competitive as possible.Thoughts ? The connection to Instawallet is always SSL enabled.However, I forgot to add the full certificate chain in addition to the actual certificate which caused some browsers to complain, it's now fixed, you shouldn't see any warnings anymore.BTW, currently our certificate is only valid for https://instawallet.org, and not for https://www.instawallet.org, we're in the process of getting a proper wildcard certificate.Thank you for pointing that out  Cross-posted from this threadApart from a couple things left to do the migration is now completed !Left to do :A very small number of accounts (less than 10) need some manual attention to reconcile operations that happened during the time span where bitcoind was listening but the database wasn't properly registering transactions. The accounts in question are identified, if you think your balance is not correct, and if it remains so after 48h have passed please contact me. The reason it might take up to 48h is that the old bitcoind must catch up with the chain after being shut down during the migration, it does so very slowly since it's packed with addresses and accounts. It must be up-to-date with the chain for transaction reconciliation to be accurate.The current SSL certificate is valid for https://instawallet.org, a new one will be installed that also validates https://www.instawallet.orgWhat has been done :The backend has been rewritten from scratch to make it much more scalable and responsive. It relies much less on bitcoind, which was a performance bottleneck and delegates the accounting to an SQL database. bitcoind is now only used to notify the backend of incoming transactions, generate an address for each account, and send fundsGeneration transactions are now understood, that means that if you're mining at Eligius, your payouts will be available after 20 confirmations if you direct them to your Instawallet (generations usually take 120 confirmations to mature)Balance updates are instant (as previously) but rely on websockets instead of long-polling (if your browser doesn't support WS it will degrade gracefully to long-polling or regular polling)A comforting cash-register sound has been added, it plays when you receive funds (except on Safari for iOS)Instawallet will now tell you about the confirmed status of your funds, previously you'd get an error message when trying to send, but you had no way to know whether funds were confirmed or notThe new API is fully backwards compatible with the original API, it will be deprecated at some point but for now it's good enough to meThe new server is a Intel Xeon 8-cores with 24GB RAM, and a lightning-fast SSD hard-drive. (The previous server had a single-core CPU, 1GB RAM and a regular HDD)A paranoid firewall has been set-up, along with serious monitoring, and monitoring of the monitoring An iPhone app is available worldwide, for free, in the AppStore, it's called FriendlyPay, it's awesome and it lets you carry Instawallet in your pocket, an Android version is almost readyIf there's anything that should be fixed you may comment here, drop me a line by PM, send me an e-mail at david {at} bitcoin-central.net, or drop by at the office in Boulogne, right near Paris !I really want to thank Jan Vornberger, Instawallet's previous owner for being very available and responsive during the whole migration process, having thought of such a cool concept, providing me with loads of hand-crafted documentation, and more generally being awesome. He is a gentleman.Thank you for your attention !
FYI Instawallet actually has a full-fledged iPhone app, it's called FriendlyPay, Android one is on its way, and it doesn't take fees on outgoing transactions. Instawallet now also has a nice websocket API that will push balance updates in real-time without relying on long-polling.We'll definitely keep an eye on you  Cross-posted from this threadApart from a couple things left to do the migration is now completed !Left to do :A very small number of accounts (less than 10) need some manual attention to reconcile operations that happened during the time span where bitcoind was listening but the database wasn't properly registering transactions.

He is a gentleman.Thank you for your attention ! Jan is the name of the person who used to own Instawallet We will definitely have some stats posted later on. can't hear you i'm running!There are no implicit regulations, but that's a really good point, I should write some ToS and mention that because there are a couple of accounts that haven't been accessed for a while. Some accounts haven't been visited since Jan implemented such tracking, but I'm unsure of *when* the tracking was actually implemented.The migration is now complete, and as soon as the new DNS records propagate Instawallet should be back up. It should also be much faster, and handle concurrent connections much more reliably. I'll elaborate on  all that, and provide some statistics after I get some sleep As always, users are more than welcome to report any issues they might encounter at david {at} bitcoin-central.net.To all bitcoiners : thank you having been so patient ! Hello all !Instawallet will be down for a few hours for maintenance operations.It will come back much more responsive and fast than in its current version.Thank you all for your patience ! There's also Paytunia that does good job if you don't want to download the full chain and don't mind using a hosted wallet. monitoring! It times out all the time, because the bitcoin client is choking on the huge pile of accounts it has to keep up to date.It's been re-engineered and re-written from scratch.The new version is already online for testing, be my guest https://instawallet.california.paymium.com I just did the math. Looks like it is ridiculously safe.Time in billions of years it would take to exhaust seed space at 1 billion seeds/second --> http://tinyurl.com/6uy9acmIt is safer than it intuitively looks like I guess  I'm not sure it would be very practical for manufacturers (they'd have to update the chain constantly), for users (they'd have to give up significant storage space), and for cellular networks.I never said it would be a good idea to use multiple seeds.I'm simply stating that using a seed to deterministically generate an potentially infinite sequence of adresses is not neutral from a security POV since you're basically limiting the entropy of your complete key collection to the entropy of the original seed. Which according to you is (by default) even lower than the entropy provided by the random generation of a single address. they have been kicked out a long time ago How would that change anything? (or maybe you're being sarcastic ) You're right! Sorry about that!I personnaly am not a big fan of limiting one's wallet entropy to a single seed, but I'll admit that it's a very clever idea! The blockchain gets recorded in a per-app storage space which is IMO sub-optimal.This leaves three types of possible wallets : - full bitcoin node like BitPak (requires lots of storage, lots of connectivity, IMO a bad option) - key-storage on the device like blockchain.info (good option if you're serious about backups and know what you're doing) - hosted wallet like Paytunia (in beta), FriendlyPay (good option if you want to take advantage of automatic backups and cold-storage, spend limits, push notifications, automatic green address sends, much better integration into exchanges etc.)I don't think that any of the two last approaches is inherently better than the other, they just address different use-cases and targets. I think blockchain.info is preferable for advanced or technically literate users who don't mind taking care of their own security, while the hosted wallet approach better addresses everyday payments use cases and regular users. Both approaches are best suited for moderate amounts IMO. That is correct It does allow sending coins, without the need of an external QR code reader  I wouldn't recommend BitPak, it downloads the full blockchain, therefore it requires lots of time to initialize and storage to store the chain.FriendlyPay sits on Instawallet, it uses the documented API, so it doesn't need to do any crypto.Instawallet is being rewritten from scratch, currently it can be very slow (it relies too much on the bitcoin client which isn't able to handle multiple requests concurrently).In a few days, when the new Instawallet is live FriendlyPay will probably be the best option for anyone looking for a simple wallet for a non-jailbroken iPhone.Disclaimer : I'm now the lead developer for Instawallet, and I know the person who wrote FriendlyPay  Well, there is FriendlyPay and BitPak that are available for the iPhone monitoring
This is aimed mostly at shared wallets that are used by webapps and that maintain a balance right inside the client for every user (or non-user account).The accounts are not permitted to go into negative, only the default account "" may have a negative balance.Getting to pick which address actually sends the coin isn't available without patching the client. I believe MSB licenses are state-specific, apparently from what I read they're (or a partner is) licensed in NY. The suggestion is simply to let users set the tx fee to zero if they wish (after a big bold warning), and not force a tx fee even when a human user nicely asked specifically not to add one. It's just an annoyance I had when testing MultiBit, other than that I really like it. If you're in Europe and ready to work fulltime PM me. For small amounts it's perfectly relevant, for big amounts I wouldn't trust bitbills (or any variant) anyway.Regarding the hacking opportunities you're wrong, pulling off a double spend isn't exactly as easy as tricking the faucet, the ATM will just wait ten seconds in order for the first payment to be properly propagated. Maybe it could be programmed to allow to have only X coins pending confirmation, it would greatly limit the incentive to attempt double-spends.Or maybe you could send funds to the ATM while not being right in front of it, in advance, once the transaction is confirmed you get a receipt that is redeemable for cash at the ATM. I suggest making the transaction fee a real user-settable setting. Le carnet d'ordres montre les ordres actifs en ce moment et non l'historique des transactions passées, tu peux te rendre compte des transactions récentes simplement en regardant le graphe en première page ou chaque point représente un échange. You're not very far from the truth  I'm not sure about the price, everything is negotiable with good arguments  I resent this comment.You obviously don't have the slightest clue about the time it takes to : - review IW's codebase - review every single patch that is applied to bitcoind in order to provide for IW's functionality - properly install, configure, armor, firewall, monitor, optimize, replicate and document a brand new military-grade server - read, review and fully understand the extended documentation jav provided meWhile at the same time : - maintain and improve Paytunia, its Android and iOS apps, - maintain Bitcoin-Central.net, support its customers, most of them beginning with Bitcoin, for free, as alwaysAnd lots of other stuff.For the record Instawallet is currently running on and AMD Athlon server with 1GB RAM, 100MB/s connection, and 2x160GB hard-drive.It will be running on a Xeon 8-core with 24GB RAM, 300GB SSD hard-drive and a 1GB connection, heavy optimizations, a host of security measures, and a rock-solid replication and failover scheme.A really quick glimpse on how seriously I'm taking this server issue :So let me just tell you that : - I'm working on it, fucking hard, - You'll be delighted with the result, - I won't take this kind of shit, whoever it comes fromAnd I even forgot to mention all the heavy testing required before migrating a server that serves hundreds of users with minimal downtime...I really want to take good care of Instawallet because it deserves to be loved, so I will ask you kindly to please bear with us  I got this game for xmas but I haven't played it and don't plan to.I'm not sure whether the version I have is French-specific but I'd be happy to sell it for 12 BTCI think what matters is the CD key right ? Bienvenue ! We can take support requests at support@bitcoin-central.net as we also have access to the current production server.We'll probably keep a mention of Jan in the footer or elsewhere to credit him for his brilliant idea and its flawless execution !Regarding the migration topic, it's in good progress. We want to have as little downtime as possible. Please bear with us while our future beefed-up production server is being heavily firewalled, secured, booby-trapped and set-up for transparent replication to our failover servers. This is even better We have just published a build!If you requested an invite and registered with testflight you can now install Paytunia on your iPhone ! I'll make it 1 BTC Yeah, that sure wouldn't be very much fun.However, the more I think about it, the more an SMS wallet sounds like a terrific idea! I think it really depends on what capabilities we're looking at : - web browsing ? - e-mail ? - what are the possibilities in terms of app development ?I think the most portable wallet would be something SMS-based : - send a SMS to create a password protected wallet, - you're answered with a wallet ID, - you send money to someone by sending your wallet ID, your password, and the amount by SMS, - you're answered with your updated balance I think it really depends on what capabilities we're looking at : - web browsing ? - e-mail ? - what are the possibilities in terms of app development ?I think the most portable wallet would be something SMS-based : - send a SMS to create a password protected wallet, - you're answered with a wallet ID, - you send money to someone by sending your wallet ID, your password, and the amount by SMS, - you're answered with your updated balance
You can store your coins at Paytunia.comThe service itself is new, but it runs on the Bitcoin-Central.net platform which is operating since 2010 without any problem. I don't really worry about the market, I'm sure it can take care of itself  Traders set the price, I'm not saying that mtgox shutting down wouldn't impact it, but simply that there is demand for Bitcoin trading, this demand would just have to get satisfied elsewhere on other exchanges.Just because mtgox has an important influence *today* doesn't mean it is necessary at all for Bitcoin to be traded by the people who want to trade it. If mtgox got shut down bitcoinica would be unable to operate since AFAIK they're simply a layer on top of mtgox.Other exchanges would simply gain volume. You seem upset ah come on, don't be so dramatic! being dramatic "♬ c'est vraiment pédé! ♬" You removed a mistake, but you added another one "♬ et ça c'est vraiment pédé! ♬"Source : http://www.10minutesaperdre.fr/2010/07/02/vraiment-pd/ Making spelling mistakes in a two-letter word, as we say in French : "♬ ça c'est vraiment pédé! ♬" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIQPfeUTtg i think that deep down, you just need a hug Just wait for the next FriendlyPay version  As state of the art wallets you might want to try Paytunia (hosted wallet with iOS and Android mobile apps) it's tightly integrated into the Bitcoin-Central.net exchange and "just works" fast.You may also want to try Instawallet.org for ease of use and increased anonymity.Cheers! Granted, check it out and tell me what you think about itGood catch! I really want to implement it properly though, with optional amount, label etc... So it won't happen right now, but definitely soon! Really nice !But how does that instant SEPA thing work ? Never heard about it, but it sure sounds interesting !EDIT : Oh, I'm so very sorry, I just actually read your FAQ and got it  PM sent ! Thanks!Part of the idea behind it is that we think e-mail addresses will quickly become the standard way of sending Bitcoins to hosted wallets, it would be pretty easy to for example to set-up a DNS record per domain that points to Bitcoin address resolution service.That's how it would happen : - I try to send coins to user@somedomain.com - A DNS query for the "BTC" field is fired for somedomain.com - Answer is "bitcoin-resolver.somedomain.com" - A query is made to bitcoin-resolver.somedomain.com requesting an address for "user" - A bitcoin address is returned - Funds are sent through the Bitcoin network - If the DNS record doesn't exist then an e-mail is sentSimple. Seamless. We're working on it  matonis already answered with a couple interesting links to the Visa developer site  Now available at Paytunia.com send to e-mail feature, definitely the easiest way to introduce someone to Bitcoin !How it works : - Send Bitcoins to an e-mail address instead of a Bitcoin address, - If the recipient already has a Paytunia account then funds are credited instantly, his Android or iOS app gets notified instantly, - If the e-mail doesn't match a Paytunia account he can :    - create one and redeem his funds there,    - sign-in to another account and redeem his funds;    - provide an arbitrary Bitcoin address to which funds will be sent - Transfers are valid six days, after that it is cancelled, the funds are recredited to the sending account and both parties get an e-mail notificationWhile the transfer is pending redemption it is possible for the sender to cancel it. When this happens both parties get notified.Also we still have a couple invites left if you wish to beta-test our iOS application, the Android one is already available on Google Play !Try it out for yourself ! Send interface :Notification : Not to hijhack this thread but...We have on Paytunia  Thank you! That's really interesting!
Just for the record : Paytunia.com has this exact feature, upon reception users may create a Paytunia account, or provide an arbitrary address to claim their funds. If the funds aren't claimed they get automatically refunded to the sender.Also you should remove the 's' from 'fantastiques'  I do really like your design! niceAlso you haven't answered this valid question :... or is it just some sort of hack you're "still testing" ? I work in the same building as some experts in the payment industry, I have asked them this question : "Is it possible to credit a credit/debit card with an arbitrary amount ?"The answer was clear : "No, unless it is a prepaid credit card. The only way to credit a card is to make a refund of a previous payment that got authorized and then captured"So my question is : do you have an independent source or reference mentioning this "new feature" ?Thank you! Get on the bitcoin-central.net train  How is that different from requiring that a wallet should let the user transfer his balance to any arbitrary address, at any time ?So that leaves out all native code applications of your guideline-compliant list ?You're not actually specifying what a good, usable and secure Bitcoin wallet is, but more what a wallet should be to appeal to a paranoid-techno-geek audience. And don't get me wrong, I'm not implying that it is a bad thing. I'm just saying your guidelines target a specific kind of wallets, that appeal to a smaller target than what you're probably intending.Oh, and to comment on your last post, maybe you shouldn't assume that all transaction clearing happens through the Bitcoin network It's not the mission of an exchange to proactively try to detect potential illegal usage of Bitcoin.Entrapment concerns are irrelevant, if I go to my bank, withdraw cash and tell them that I'm going to use it for shady purposes they won't freeze my account.They *might* report me to the police, but they wouldn't be entitled to freeze my account.The only actual requirement financial institutions have is to report suspected money laundering, and suspected tax evasion in some places.Either way, I'm sure that this story isn't as simple as it looks. That's just marketing talk unless you also require it has to be fully open-sourced too, otherwise you'd have no way to tell whether keys are shared or not.The bitcoin network itself is the best interoperability guarantee. I don't really see an advantage in devising extra import/export schemes.My point is that you're listing technical requirements, most of them, if not all having pretty much zero impact on the actual user friendlyness and usability. The xkcd strip sounds more and more accurate the more I read in this thread  If you can pay with it, and put money in it, then it's a wallet.Whether you can pay by scanning a URI, spelling out the firstbits to Siri, or using an overlay protocol gives the same functionality.Whether you fund it by importing keys in X, Y or Z format, or even by photographing dollar bills is too detailed too.Whether the keys are hosted or local seems beyond scope to me as well. Web apps can't read QR codes :/But they can work offline just like a native app when a cache manifest is used along with HTML 5 local storage capabilities. If you try to appeal you should probably mention that bitpak does it already. Could you tell us exactly what rejection message they gave you ? And which section of the Developer guidelines they use to base their rejection ? I don't mean to sting, I'm just stating things as I see them, and as I experienced for some of them.I'm just saying that I have a hard time believing that your primary motivation is what you advertise given what you're willing to shell out. But that's only a reflection of my own state of mind I guess. I'm not in your head so I can't know what drives you.It's ok, you seem to have it all figured out anyway I don't understand how you'd do that.But if you're actually able to, you're probably going to be very successful.I have no desire to convince you or force my opinion upon you. I can share my own experience though : it's very costly (in terms of time, money and stress), but also very rewarding.I'm sorry to hear that, don't hesitate to drop me a line if I can make it right or just let me know what could have been done better.Cheers! monitoring It does sound cliché, especially if you're putting 25kUSD cash into getting it setup, and saying it's not-for-profit +1Maybe that's taken out of context, but said like this it doesn't make any sense at all to me.... is pretty much all I hear from what you're sayingThis just gets better and better.You do not seem to be aware of what things really cost... *monitoring* What's your motivation ? Comme certains l'ont souligné, Paytunia propose un certain type de wallet. L'objectif est de proposer une solution simple et très ergonomique au plus grand nombre.Nous reviendrons prochainement sur les avantages liés à cette spécificité.En tout cas, merci beaucoup pour vos retours et avis <3PS. Nous avons ajouté une dizaine d'invitations pour la bêta privée de Paytunia iPhone, si vous souhaitez en obtenir une les détails sont ici : https://paytunia.com/blog/paytunia-for-iphone-now-in-invitation-only-beta Thank you all for your great feedback!Soon we'll be posting on our blog about the future of Paytunia and its place in the Bitcoin ecosystem.We'll use this as an opportunity to address some of the concerns that have been expressed here.Stay tuned! My bad, I forgot to mention that the code is beautiful too.Not really, we're full reserve and we don't lend out money with interests.We do, however, keep money safe and provide services to our customers, which we think is a good thing. - We're nothing like mybitcoin, first of all Paytunia is beautiful like you said .  - Secondly it's run by a registered and liable French company, my name and the ones of my associates are pretty much public if you care to search a little bit. - Finally it wouldn't make sense to rip a few users out of their money and pass on the opportunity to be an important player in the Bitcoin world.Be my guest, name one that has an iOS version. Yep, that's what I thought  Please open a support ticket from your account.
Let's remain on topic, please. We have nothing against skipping Google Play and publishing an APK directly, I'm not really sure about what the problem with Google Play though, could you be a little more specific ? That is correct, I've logged an issue to improve this. Thanks for the feedback!Yes, we're looking into options to improve this, improvement might come from the bitcoin client itself, with transactional fee handling (ie. knowing in advance the required fee prior to actually posting the transaction), it might also come from us partnering with, or launching a mining pool.The minimal amount constraint will, however, soon be dropped for transfers between Paytunia users.Thank you! If you're asking whether the wallet is also available on the web, then yes, it is available from the Paytunia website.If you already have a Bitcoin-Central.net account you can use it to sign-in. Yes, absolutely, you'll find it hereWe have a couple of options regarding this, whatever happens will be announced way in advance though. Transfers are instant between Paytunia users, if you receive money from the Bitcoin network you will have to wait for two confirmations.Bitcoins are stored in Paytunia's hosted wallet, which contains only a small fraction of the deposits. Your phone is a lightweight client consuming our API, which is compatible with the Bitcoin-Central.net API.There already exists an iOS app that act as a full Bitcoin node, but we think that's overkill given the limited storage amount and network connectivity of such an iPhone.Paytunia does not require 1G+ free space, doesn't take more than a few seconds to get started with, and will notify you of balance updates whether you're on Wifi, 3G, or regular network. Oh, and it's gonna be free too ! Soon !It is dead-easy to use, it doesn't target hardcore users, but a much broader audience, and it is fast.Also it will in a close future be tightly integrated with Instawallet in order to be as anonymous as you want it to be.Our roadmap also has plans to reduce the gap between fiat and Bitcoin, we'll communicate about this in the next couple of months. Yes, however don't hesitate to share ideas and suggestions regarding the Android version  Hello everyone !The Paymium team and I are very proud to announce the launch of Paytunia, our brand new Bitcoin lightweight wallet solution !We designed it to be fast, simple and secure. You can sign-up online at https://paytunia.com, directly from your Android phone or use an existing Bitcoin-Central.net account.We will soon be launching our iPhone app on Apple's AppStore, in the meantime we'll be sending 30 beta invitations to install the application on your iOS device for free (your phone doesn't need to be jailbroken). Use a support ticket to request an invite. First come, first serve.You can read the announcement here.We'd be very pleased to hear about your questions and comments ! Yes, transactions are all logged by the Bitcoin client itself. <3 The trade order interface is indeed a little confusing and will get some code-level loving.Market orders are also available, you'll want to review the order book in relation to the size of your order before posting though given the limited market depth.The trading engine will soon get a heavy lifting in order to simplify the UI and add brokerage behavior (your orders will get executed against orders on other platforms in order to have much better liquidity)Thanks for your feedback! do you really know your bank ?haha, right. This app looks sexy but it's pretty much unusable, I left it a couple of nights on foreground and wifi and the block chain DL is still around ~40% slowly eating more and more of my not-so-plentiful space.I think light clients (server based) will be far more successful. I don't think the fact that the client can hold private keys will be of great relevance since I think most bitcoin payments in the future won't even hit the bitcoin network.It's an awesome PoC but a really bad wallet so far.Looked promising... but no.  I'll be very happy to help your European customers !EDIT : Send me a PM if interested, I don't hang around here very much these days Code:-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1Not sure if I'm still needed here.If an escrow party is needed funds can be sent here : 1GR8kvnAz3sz5F1sDXACPMAL2xn57nj8YU-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (Darwin)iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJO6H9JAAoJEBMojqsBcTQoQ4YH/1VM6DwTqt+Fdcyhf/zA2/s/iHkW95kAUjaxc/MyH1gh/OE02wxOnvhuz/L29Qzu0Mfaky0GzFlrfNgeQRWuckee3Wod23WdSiAkTyF8TwnsaCN+mmiSInW7FVPGIVKrMVAmK/QXW37keXyPUfmCnY2lrq/C0Xmsa1VYvNdbhkpH+N0+5QTAZX7FmB/zz6PBk1y2GFqC+Estdgk20yUpRlWngmyF1XTP/v+U6wqJf0zMHauyhS+SX/aiw6JG1TH7NQYFMLJHXKc0p//GM618/VUbM5xbZiYAFa4xoHsyQR6TpuwODpF/7EEoFj1Zix/UUXvCDsNVREw/2rrQ5g/xsLA==e1FH-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- +1 I faudrait essayer la chose suivanteCode:$ bitcoin validateaddress ADRESSEle client te dira si l'adresse en question appartient à son wallet dans le champ "ismine" Quand je dis tous les fichiers c'est tout le répertoire bitcoin au grand complet.

+1 ! As-tu supprimé le fichier wallet.dat ? Ou les autres fichiers .dat du répertoire bitcoin ? There's no such thing as "WE" This is an ordonnance de référé, it basically means it is an emergency ruling.The gist : Isn't it a way to differentiate testnet addresses also ? Well, I'm not really impressed if they're using some currency conversion scheme.I'm really fucking impressed if they're using some sort of "trading path" algorithm. I'm impressed. Change your avatar  Well, "retarded" might be a bit strong, I mean that it can be a good idea in *some* cases, but for an exchange it is not. A hackathon is actually a pretty retarded idea since nothing guarantees that flaws will be reported instead of being exploited after the launch. Maybe you're already planning it this way but these should behave like tags, so you can attach multiple tags to a business/service. The mere fact that you mention some sort of "cake", some sort of advantage you'd lose by fully exposing your concept puts this whole thread in my TL;DR stash. That's a weird way to make a rep... Hi my name is David and I don't mineWelcome!  Aww, can I have one too please ? <3 i know the allinvain story. I'm just giving this person the benefit of the doubt  If I was the bank I wouldn't open the bitcoin can of worms, instead, I'd focus on the mtgox USD.Clearly, *that* is an e-currency : - It's issued by a central authority: Tibanne, - it is an instrument that represents debt, the creditor being the user, and the debtor being tibanne, - it is redeemable against fiat currency, - it is transferable to a third party using an mtgox code He stated he lost his forum account...Who are you OP ? Of course he doesn't, IBB doesn't do usury 
Yep, the SEPA EUR withdraw option disappeared, this sucks, I have a USD balance that I got before the new markets got rolled out.So you're saying that now, additionnaly to the 2% fee I'll also have to pay a currency exchange fee ? IBB ? change yourself, the universe will follow Actually a couple of lines : the genesis timestamp, nonce, merkle root, and the actual block hash that you need to compute. But yes, it's not very hard, also don't forget to remove and hardcoded checkpoints  Ce serait une excellente nouvelle, le capital requis pour ouvrir un bureau de change n'est que de 38k.Mais aucune chance que cela n'arrive  I beg to disagree, I feel that the less bitcoins circulate the more value they lose.If it's used like a currency, if it circulates, if people are trading with them then mechanically more people will use them, more people will accept them, they will necessarily gain value and remain stable.Waiting 20 years won't make them anymore valuable if everyone hoards them...Somehow I feel it's like a self balancing mechanism  Thanks to the OP for the log graph, pretty interesting way to look at things!Most people that bought coins to hold them, imagining they'd make a x100 profit were mistaken about bitcoin's very nature... Can you try to be a little more vague please ? Hmm, okay i'll spell it out... slowly... if you pick a package up, it shows you ordered it. If you get a package in your mailbox containing drugs the police will not be able to prove that you ordered it, someone could have mailed it to you with malicious intent.If you pick a package up from the post office at a "poste restante" it makes it clear that : - you were expecting the package - you took steps to hide the link between the package and you Hmm est-ce qu'avec ces histoires les retraits SEPA sont effectués en ce moment ou alors ils sont mis en attente ? Hmm, même avec tes nouveaux marchés ? Je peux pas par exemple t'envoyer un virement en euros et ensuite demander un retrait en dollars ? Je pense que ca peut être risqué de soutenir que tu ne remplis pas une mission d'agent de change si c'est possible de le faire indirectement via mtgox.Tu seras présent à l'audience ? Tout ca promet d'être très intéressant ! Oui this is a cheap price to pay to make an example Wanna show up for the ruling ?I'll be there  Because that makes the receiver vulnerable.If they go pick a package up at a post office they can't claim it was mailed to them without their knowledge in case the cops are also at the post office. lol, PHP in itself is a crime against good code Alors ? J'ai faim  Ah j'oubliais, MT devrait peut-être se méfier et faire vraiment attention, parce que la banque avance qu'il exerce illégalement la profession d'agent de change... Je ne sais pas si il permet l'échange de devises entre les 15 nouveaux différents marchés qu'il a ouvert.Ca promet d'être intéressant! Personnellement j'essaierai d'être à l'audience du 13. Y a déjà deux threads sur le sujet, poste plutot tes infos dans le thread en francais. Et puis le titre veut pas dire grand chose, ca n'existe pas un compte bancaire en bitcoins. La loi est très claire : bitcoin n'est pas une monnaie électronique.Je pense que la ou MT peut éventuellement être embêté c'est pour détournement d'objet social de Macaraja, peut-être au niveau TVA aussi...J'ai aussi lu dans l'ordonnance de référé que Macaraja ne "faisait pas de paiements au public", ca m'échappe un peu, parce que jusqu'à présent, à chaque fois que j'ai demandé un virement, Macaraja en était l'émetteur.Affaire à suivre 
Hit me, I'll polish the code. If you do it yourself can you request a pull ?Payment received  There is lots of interesting info in that PDF ... Specific about what ? Here you go. - https://rubygems.org/gems/liberty_reserve - https://github.com/davout/liberty_reserveIt makes use of nokogiri, features some tests, documented with RDocLet me know if you'd like some changes/customizations.You can install the gem simply withCode:# gem install liberty_reserveYou can send the payment here : 1HH3ex26ZQ8HQ8GbghJw9CQiiLPYTnRjHf There's already bitcoin-central.net with a 0% trading fee What goes around, comes around... Maged deleted it, see the staff subforum. I'll do the Liberty Reserve gem. It'll be ready sunday at 8 PM GMT. Effectivement, je peux pas bannir, des fois ca me démangeN'hésitez-pas à utiliser le report  That's not really news, these declarations have been around for a while. Non, son raisonnement est bon, c'est la prémisse qui n'a rien d'une vérité absolue."Je suis le premier à trouver, donc ça m'appartient" c'est tout à fait arbitraire. Tout comme "Tu es un métèque, je suis un Grec, tes droits sont inférieurs aux miens".La propriété privée n'a rien d'absolu, elle dépend du contexte et de l'observateur. Les indiens d'Amérique n'avaient pas le même concept de la propriété que les colons, ça a pu créer quelques légers malentendus  I hope nobody minds if I chime in ? Yes, some sort of revenue will take place in the middle-term, there might be a fee on trades, but it will always remain significantly lower than the competition.There are other revenue sources that have to be taken in consideration when deciding whether a business model is sketchy or not. For example, an exchange service can remain free forever if it manages to keep its operating costs lower than the interests it is getting just to let its users deposits sit at a bank.In case some of you didn't know, Bitcoin-Central.net is also a showcase for the eponym open-source exchange platform that also powers some other popular exchanges. So there is also potential revenue in expert consulting.Oh, and if someone has concerns about security remember it's fully open sourced (the version you see on github is the version running on the server). Let me tell you that being aware of people reading your code over your shoulder is the best incentive to write secure and clean software  Thank you for bringing this to my attention. PR is OK, spamming can't be tolerated. I think they'll eventually get bored  Yep, sometimes you do wake up in the middle of retarded threads though, like the ones debating whether it's ok to replace random data with religious random data, you realize that you might as well be posting in "should my dog wear a kippah on saturdays?".A lot of early forum members still lurk the forums with pleasure though, and most of us have a keyboard shortcut that pastes "this is probably because your client hasn't finished the initial blockchain download"  LOL, gtfo Thanks a lot ! Offering new currencies is easy, allowing people to fund their accounts locally with low fees is the hard part  Monitoring this Can someone whitelist user Amit@bitcoin-central.net ?Thanks Hello everyone !We are excited to announce that Bitcoin-Central.net now officially supports trading in Canadian Dollars (CAD) and Indian Rupees (INR).We've worked hard to provide the community with cheap funding and withdrawal options :Canadian DollarsRegarding CAD you can fund your account for free by making a cash deposit in one of the 1070 CIBC branches in Canada, you can also fund your account using an Interac e-mail transfer with a cheap 1.5 CAD fee. Withdrawing can't be much easier either, you can withdraw using an Interac transfer for a flat 5 CAD.Indian RupeesFor INR you can deposit the money by wire transfer to our bank account in India with low fees.Instructions for deposits are here : - Canadian Dollars - Indian RupeesWe're also proud to announce that another European bank account will soon be opened, the withdrawal fee will then drop from 15 EUR to a fraction of a percent of the requested amount.Trading is still free of commissions ! Open an account today and start trading right away, use our Google Authenticator and YubiKey two-factor authentication features for easily added security.Don't hesitate to drop us a line !
You can import it directly in the client using the "importprivkey" command, however, this command is not yet part of the official client, you need to compile sipa's fork to get it (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin.git, showwallet branch) it will rescan the chain, and the coins should be spendable from there. Captcha, OTP, mouse typed pin What we do at BC is simply put transfers in pending state when there is not enough to cover instantly, we get notified, fund the server, from there a periodic task processes pending transfers. Or the operator can manage to have enough funds online to satisfy the withdraws while at the same time keeping most of the funds secured. If the online funds are stolen, the operator must eat the loss, the risk should be compensated by the fees.There are better ways to prevent keyloggers from withdrawing from your account, mouse typed PINs, captchas, one-time passwords, etc.These days everyone has a smartphone, generating OTPs on a smartphone is a really good and secure way of protecting accesses and ensuring that requests originate from humans. Reworded : this is the only place where a user is not automatically protected by the cold storage measures that should be in place by default I'll take the bitcoin-central example. The vast majority of our holding are in cold storage, we make it completely transparent to the user.Users shouldn't have to worry about that, and they shouldn't have to pay either A regular bank doesn't tell you that you have to choose how much of your cash should be in the safe as opposed to simply lying in the cashiers drawer.Even mentioning cold storage communicates the idea that your regular storage is insecure.Just my 2 satoshis I think it is a much better idea than somehow attaching btc to an email, as far as cutting down on spam is concerned.Sometimes, ideas don't make it to the masses, not because the idea isn't good in itself, but because the masses aren't ready. http://www.hashcash.org/This is much better if your objective is to cut on spam. Well, let's change that then  I doubt they allow orders to be placed with such precise amounts.Anyway I'm not TH so I should just step aside and let them answer  Um. why ? Feeding the same troll hundreds of times is usually not a sign of bright intelligence  I'd have done the same. Si tu ne trouves pas preneur pour ton paypal tu peux toujours faire un virement en euros sur Bitcoin-Central.net Ce n'est pas utilisé dans l'immédiat.I est envisagé de valider à terme l'identité des gens qui envoient de l'argent afin d'éviter de recevoir des fonds provenant d'un phishing de compte bancaire. We've already seen the security part, we're still waiting for margin trading from the R&D team. And I think that the interests that are generated by the money being deposited can fund the maintenance part.I'm not worried, the market will regulate it and make it much more efficient. Meh, I think 0.4% is still way too high since you usually don't buy/sell the same coins only once. RubyThey are. And you better make use of the serializable isolation level. Give them to the faucet. Are they the ones you generated pointing something comparable to the NASA computational power at testnet for like two hours ? Testnet has been reset since then  There's also the testnet faucet. Both approaches work.On bitcoin-central.net, rows are edited. I'm thinking this should change at some point since you end up losing information, not information that is useful for performing the trading, but history that could be interesting for a trader to have.Source code is here : https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-central/blob/master/app/models/trade_order.rbLine 138 is where the magic starts to happen.
Personnellement je ne suis pas intéressé. J'essaie de tout faire pour justement rendre les premiers achats simples sur bitcoin-central.netAprès si tu as des clients qui y trouvent leur compte c'est très bien pour toi. Ben, à 3,5x le prix je suis pas sur qu'il y en ait justement XD Et donc quoi ? On doit pas aller sur les mêmes marchés  Stop polluting the forums with your nonsense. Nobody cares.Quit being such an anal whiner and get busy doing stuff that actually matters to the community, you know, just like luke-jr. Rien reçu Alors ?Quelqu'un a essayé ? On arrive à quel taux globalement ? C'est super étrange...J'aurai un téléphone Android sous la main demain, je testerai avec.Envoie moi de quoi identifier ton compte à l'addresse du support et je désactive l'OTP, si tu as accès dans l'appli Android à ton secret partagé envoie le moi également et je vérifierai que ca correspond bien. Bitcoin-Central.net accepts european bank wires for free, and doesn't charge a trading commission, might be the easiest for you if you can wait 24 to 48h for your bank wire to clear. Etrange.Ca marche chez moi sur iPhone. T'es sur que ton OTP est pas expiré ? Le timing est super important ils ne sont valables que 30 secondes. Seen in your FAQ, just sayin'  Come have a beer in Paris  Well, yeah, bitcoin is peer-to-peer...You don't even need to, you just need to check that once you start using it, you receive blocks built upon it, or ask a few peers for block hash at height X and check that it matches your chain.But I guess the fact that it's PGP signed can't really hurt  If somebody explains to me how to setup an offline downloadable block chain I'll happily host it at bitcoin-central.net  It is, IRC is used to find the first ones to connect to. Probably because it's not easy Also IRC is used for bootstrapping connections, bittorrent has central points of failure too, the trackers. It's not a dumb question, private keys can be encoded in a variety of ways.* davout looks for his bitbill to tear it apart I don't really get it, how can I possibly protect others when the binaries I serve can potentially be malicious and I can potentially have malicious intentions ?Should I post checksums ? Doesn't work : - if I have malicious intentions the checksums will match the malicious binaries. - if the binaries get changed without me knowing it means that the server got compromised, the checksums shouldn't then be trusted either - if I post a link to SF, that won't help since some users won't be able to access it and it also could be compromisedLet's face it, if you're truly paranoid, you read the source and then you compile it. Oh wait, you'd need to compile gcc too If you have better ideas than the couple I exposed I'm open. But I'd rather give no checksums than a false sense of security. * davout clears throat Someday, bitcoin clients will simply bootstrap their chain using the bittorrent protocol
No idea, but if they do, the servers will move  No. I trust myself. If you don't, feel free to check the binaries MD5/SHA  Hah yeah, there are more features that I want to implement than hair on my head, and god knows I'm not very aerodynamic  You can add my name if you want, I'll take a .25% fee.At some point Bitcoin-Central.net will also have an escrow feature, but god knows days are only 24h long  The bitcoin binaries are now mirrored and available for download on Bitcoin-Central.net FINE You can now download the client directly from the frontpage of https://bitcoin-central.net Feel free to double check the checksums I don't think this is a really major concern since the sources are available and changing your IP is pretty easy with Tor.However I understand that some people might not be proficient enough to do that. If people express some interest I'll host copies of the binaries at bitcoin-central.net Try this : http://djp3-pc7.ics.uci.edu/codexcaelestis/?p=101I skipped the wxwidgets part altogether Yeah I see that. I don't think it's a mistake from the user, since, as you say, the total for the order is displayed in the trade order input form. The order book display definitely needs some improvement but I'd like to keep the two-column display.Thank you  Yes, a simple support tickets framework is currently being developed (see the support branch on github), and there will be a 48h answer commitment for these. Yup, you were mixing up the "bank account cancellation" problem and the "we can't get a new account opened" one. Different problems, different reasons.That's a great thing, for them, and for all the customers.That's logical, however, when merchants do that, they don't state on their website that "You are trading with other users of Mt Gox. Mt Gox does not act as a counter party to any trades.", it's a clear contradiction.Because ok, you're prepaying the fees part, but if mtgox users trade directly with each other it means that all the money that doesn't pay fees is transmitted to the other party directly, making mtgox a money transmission business. Logical isn't it ?That's also the reason it's not possible anymore to send money directly to another mtgox account from your account, it would make them instantly a money transmission business. The redeemable mtgox codes are a clever and legitimate way to *not* be considered an MSB, because they're accounted for in a different fashion.How surprising I don't think mtgox is doing anything wrong, in the morall sense, but I think they are operating in a legal gray zone and should be a little more transparent about it. Doesn't it surprise you that a web based business that handles tens of thousands USD a day doesn't have any terms of service to be found ? Absolutely not. It is because they were getting fraudulent wires from people with hijhacked/phished bank accounts. I think this is just FUD, if it's taken down from SF it will be hosted somewhere else, and if hosting the bitcoin client binaries becomes problematic I think it'll mean the bitcoin community will have much bigger problems to solve at that point than sharing some binary.Also people who seek the next, next, next experience will probably have no problem simply using an e-wallet. Sources of course, how does one get the cool patches otherwise ? Compiling on Ubuntu : All fun and gamesCompiling on OSX Lion : One of the most painful experiences ever (and I only compiled bitcoind !) You put a link to blockexplorer a few lines after the "don't use closed source tools" warning  You assume bitcoin and paypal (or other payment processors) are mutually exclusive, I think there are uses for all and niches to fill for bitcoin for example. The first one that comes to my mind is the illegal drugs market  It's fixed, thanks again for reporting. Yes, it is Rietumu Bank in Latvia.Working on it right now, should be live in 15 minutes. Thank you for reporting this  Oh, I was thinking that even before I cleared all this Governments might also not care at all, but somehow, I feel that if bitcoin really grows to be something important government will somehow have to do something to protect their control on financial flows. That's what I find really interesting with bitcoin, nobody knows what the next big event or development is going to be  Check out the end of the original grondilu thread, I've shared a script that takes a PEM and spits out the private key encoded as a QR code for easy paper storage.
Effectivement, il y avait une coquille dans l'IBAN, c'est corrigé Je suis dispo demain ou vendredi soir pour boire un pot Nice I think it's right. I predict that after the first one that revolved around security/trust issues, the second Trough of Disillusionment will be mostly about governments trying to shut exchanges down one after another or some major player getting shut down due to legal concerns.Bitcoin is such an exciting adventure, doesn't happen very often to have the opportunity of being part of something really original and new ! For those who would like to contribute, open issues, or just watch what's happening, the source code is at https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-central Toujours J'ai cross-posté en angais ici Hello everyone !I'm really proud to announce that after lots of work, Bitcoin-Central.net, the oldest and best open-source trading platform is finally live and able to process EUR transfers using SEPA wires.This basically means that it just got a whole lot easier to buy and sell bitcoin for our fellow european bitcoiners.What is Bitcoin-Central.net ?Bitcoin-Central.net is the oldest and most feature rich open-source exchange, the project has been started in late 2010 and has started accepting trading Liberty Reserve, Pecunix, and a little bit of EUR in February.All this time I've been thinking about a proper way to legally run such an exchange, consulting lawyers, implementing new functionality for all to enjoy and jumping through a lot of hoops to finally end up with a properly incorporated company and a couple of european bank accounts. This means convenient, fast and cheap SEPA transfers.Why trade at Bitcoin-Central.net ? - Trading is free, - When fees kick in they will remain extremely competitive, - Bitcoin-Central.net will evolve to provide all the bitcoin services in one convenient and easy to use interface,If you're currently in Paris, head to this thread, I want to celebrate, and it's my shout ! Bonjour à tous !Je vous annonce qu'après beaucoup de travail sur pas mal de fronts, la plateforme Bitcoin-Central.net est enfin ouverte à tous et qu'il est maintenant possible de déposer et de retirer des fonds facilement en Euros via des virements SEPA.Pourquoi trader ses bitcoins chez Bitcoin-Central ? - La très grande majorité des opérations, y compris le trading sont gratuites, - Si le trading vient à devenir payant, les tarifs resteront extrêmement compétitifs, - Bitcoin-Central.net est une des seules plateformes dont le code source est entièrement ouvert, - Bitcoin-Central.net a vocation à évoluer vers un hub de services centralisé et pratique (interfaces de paiement, bundle de transactions pour limiter les frais de transaction bitcoin)Pour fêter l'ouverture je paie ma tournée aux bitcoiners qui sont sur paris cette semaine pour ceux que ca tente de faire un petit apéro bitcoin rue des petites écuries  +1 sweet! If you propagate txes to only a single or a couple of mining nodes it could act selfishly and not relay to other mining nodes in order to keep the potential fees resulting in slower tx validation. C'est clair. J'ai failli me m'évanouir de bonheur ce matin en réussissant à faire un script qui me permettait de convertir un .pem généré par openssl en clef privée checksummée importable directement par le client bitcoin Le coup de travailler sans s'en rendre compte sur une chaine en hexa au lieu de données binaires c'est un grand classique... Sinon y a aussi le coup du little/big endian qui m'a bien torturé  Je comprends pas vraiment votre problème mais je comprends votre douleur  Yup, https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-central.gitYou can pull pretty much everything XD Bringing this thread back to life to say I've just put together a small ruby script that will : - take a PEM file such as the one shown by grondilu - process it to extract the bitcoin address - process it to extract the EC private key - format the private key so it can be imported directly with the "importprivkey" RPC call that should be part of the next versions of the bitcoin client - output a nice and fuzzy HTML file containing this data along with a couple of QR codes : (link to the address in the block explorer, private key, address)The code : https://gist.github.com/1139599The result looks like this : http://imageshack.us/f/835/capturedcran20110811144.png/Now my dream can come true : store coins safely and super easily on paper  Yay !It does work I skipped the whole wxwidgets part because I just needed the daemon with a couple of extra patches. After banging my head for a few hours on this I finally managed to get it all properly compiling/linking following your instructions.Thanks a lot ! Testing it right now  http://tinyurl.com/3k4csq8 C'est pas mal pour un suivre un projet forké, sur le projet prinicpal il faut passer par les pull request.Code:git pull --rebaseC'est encore mieux  c'est pour une bonne cause!ca me permettra de sauver un canasson de l'abattoir et de faire plaisir à ma femme en même temps Si c'est plus tard dans la semaine ca le fait aussi, mais idéalement j'ai même pas besoin de retirer le liquide, d'ou le délai serré Au pire, (et comme personne ne l'a encore mentionné) l'algo de hachage est pluggable et remplaçable  Idéalement tu as créé une branche séparée pour ton commit et tu peux utiliser le bouton "Fork queue" pour tenir master à jour
Echange en personne sur Paris/banlieue aujourd'hui ou demain. In plain english : "if for any reason we dislike you we get to make stuff up, close your account based on it, and keep your moniez"WTF... Anonymizing proxies are legal and legitimate."We will sometimes act like we're the cops and moneyrape you if you disrespect that authority"By whom ? An independent party like... Paxum ?Belize is the location of the card issuer for the Paxum Mastercards. Hence, some parts of the agreement are governed by those laws.[/quote]That's just laughable... Next time I'll write terms of service I'll put it under every funny jurisdiction possible and cherry pick the laws I like depending on the situation, each time I have to go to court I'll go simultaneously in Belize and Canada...I'll just quote nanaimogold here, he might actually be right :and Because programmers are human beings and days are 24 hours long. Haven't tried it, but I met Jesse in person in Paris. La "solution du doigt de pied" de grondilu résout tous ces problèmes  Great ! How do you manage to pull it off without downloading the chain ? Headers only ?Is it open or closed source ? Aargh, le son est vraiment pas terrible et j'avais rien préparé :/En fait j'avais compris que bruce animerait et que ce serait plutôt une discussion en anglais avec des bitcoiners francais du coup ca a été grosse impro.@MT : si on remet ca je préparerai un ordre du jour à l'avance et je te l'enverrai, en tout cas j'ai été bien content de pouvoir parler un peu avec toi  Baiscally, any C miner has this code.EDIT : Here -> http://pastebin.com/Ya3604J0 Yes, I will need to find a way to present all the available currencies in a non-overwhelming way though  IIRC theymos stated something around the lines of this, I might be completely wrong here though.I found it on Jeff Garzik's github bitcoin fork, it's funny, I went to check on the repo and I can't find the branch I used to compile bitcoin with the getblock RPC call built-in, maybe it's been included upstream. You might want to look this up because it's a pretty convenient and reliable way to get info about blocks Ok, found it, it's on the "getblockbycount" branch and hasn't been merged upstream.https://github.com/jgarzik/bitcoin/tree/getblockbycount The list of managed currencies is stored in a constant in the AccountOperation model, you need to add your currency code here to start, then you need to add its display in the account balances pages (in the future the currencies will be manageable through the admin interface), start with this and hit me up if you see it starts smoking Update the same constant in AccountOperation (or Transfer in older versions) model and remove them from the deposits and account balance views.Remove the fields from the login page and user account details page and you're all set. There is no simple configuration option as of now.I will comment on this in a few days. better, trust your local data (and abide by block explorer's ToS), use the getblockbyhash patch to pull the generation tx id in order to track confirmations for the block and possible orphan status, see https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-pool for the complete implementation http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#internationalizing-your-applicationMost of the stuff happens in the dictionary files under config/locales/{locale}/There are also a couple of localized views you need to translate, they're under app/views/**/*.{fr|en|...}.html.{erb|haml}To set the default locale change it in config/application.rbWhat do you mean ? https://github.com/macourtney/Dark-Exchange +1 Possible Dans les faits la comission est obligatoire.Toute transaction passe dans un check du client qui s'appelle isStandard qui retourne vrai ou faux.Une transaction valide peut ne pas être "standard" (très faible montant, beaucoup de INs, script particulier avec signatures multiples par exemple). Le client ajoute automatiquement une "fee" pour que la transaction passe le check isStandard, car si elle ne passe pas elle ne sera pas relayée aux mineurs par les noeuds qui utilisent le client standard.Une solution pour créer des transactions toujours gratuites est de modifier le client et de se connecter directement aux miners, et notamment le pool eligius qui ne prend pas en compte ce flag pour inclure les transactions dans les blocks qu'il mine. YesYes, go to your account balances and then click "Deposit funds"Yes, there will be a nice UI facelift by end July, this issue will be addressed. * davout attrape du popcorn Certes, je dis simplement que l'obsolescence programmée est quelque chose qui existe, et qui peut avoir un intérêt économique en raison du fait que le prix des ressources naturelles utilisées pour la production de biens et de services est inférieur à leur coût en termes de "remplacement". Plus une ressource naturelle est bon marché, plus la stratégie d'obsolescence programmée me semble valable.
Je suis pas convaincu...Regarde l'exemple des produits apple, les iphones/ipod en particulier, je pense qu'il y a une très bonne raison pour laquelle la batterie n'est pas amovible  Je suis pas sur que légalement ca tienne, mais l'initiative est intéressante  L'obsolescence programmée est une réalité, dans le monde dans lequel on vit elle est légale (ce qui n'a rien de choquant), et elle est économiquement rentable (ce qui l'est un peu plus, de mon point de vue). https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-central You should be able to, just post something like Code:{  "amount": 10.5,  "type": "buy",  "ppc":  14.867,  "currency": "LRUSD"}toCode:https://bitcoin-central.net/account/trade_orderswith HTTP auth it should just work.If it doesn't it's a bug and will get the fix it deserves The API part is mostly untested, so don't hesitate to drop me a line if you have problems. You can get the full orderbook here :In HTMLCode:https://bitcoin-central.net/account/trade_orders/bookIn XMLCode:https://bitcoin-central.net/account/trade_orders/book.xmlIn JSONCode:https://bitcoin-central.net/account/trade_orders/book.jsonLRUSD orders in JSONCode:https://bitcoin-central.net/account/trade_orders/book.json?currency=lrusdBC is RESTful by design and supports HTTP basic auth. meaning that you can pretty much do whatever you want and pass parameters as a form, in JSON or XML, hasn't been really tested in the wild, so I'll be happy to get bug reports Responses to GET requests usually only support HTML default format, but if you need a JSON/XML response just drop me a line. * davout points at grondilu See this : http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=11043.0 Moi aussi je serai probablement en vélo gris  J'ai déjà un engagement pour le lundi 11, suivant les possibilités je passerai peut-être par la suite C'est dans celui de cette semaine ? Mercredi... Genre... Demain ? * davout n'est décidément pas le meilleur en organisation I don't really the point in having newbie limits, there are pretty much only newbies on the forums these days anyway  They're created automatically when you request an account-associated address. Recently Gavin pushed some first unit tests to the bitcoin source tree, which is really good and definitely needed.It made me think though, that the unit tests are very low level, and that it would be really nice to also have "test bitcoin as a black box using JSPON-RPC calls" approach.So I was thinking about starting a Rails app that does the following thing :Each time a commit is pushed upstream - The code is fetched, and built - The low level unit tests are run and results recorded - If the build was successful, a defined wallet and blockchain dump are put in place - The client is launched and given the opportunity to re-scan - Behaviour tests are run (written in Ruby), for example :Code:class BasicTests < UnitTest  test "should honor credentials" do    response = Bitcoin::Client.rpc_call(wrong_credentials)    assert_equal 401, response.status  endend - Nice reporting and notifications are presented to developers and the publicSo, my questions are :  - Does anyone think this is desirable, - Would anyone be willing to contribute application code and tests code if I start and lead the project ?That'll be all for now  If you need the accounting feats then pass it an account label. Otherwise just use getnewaddress. L'important n'est pas tant le temps exact mais l'ordre des transactions.Le timestamp est toutefois vérifié par les pairs qui peuvent considérer comme invalides les blocks avec un timestamp fantaisiste.Concernant la diffusion de plusieurs blocks au même moment c'est géré sans problème, chaque reçoit un des deux blocks avant l'autre et le considère comme le dernier block valide, ce n'est que le block suivant qui arbitrera en faveur d'un block ou l'autre étant donné qu'il aura pris pour base un des deux ex-aequo.  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification#Addresses Depends on which parts  Oui, c'est normal.Tu fais ton projet en quel langage ?
I feel a little stupid, you're right, the hash of one of the last X blocks could do the trick  timestamps are smaller, and i can see other uses for a timestamp in a transaction, actually there already is a lock_time field, i have no idea what it's used for though Miners already decide the fees they require. I'm not sure I see your point.haha yea, hadn't thought about that, maybe add an extra timestamp field then.nonce and timestamp could be discarded before inclusion in a block, umm wait a second, actually no. Yes, absolutely, I will provide a pool running on testnet so it's easy to see that the payment handling code works as it should, and that the block handling and everything else is also ok.I'll post here in less than 24h. You mean that the current diff should be taken into account to compute a target that would be necessary to reach to pass isStandard ? You don't understand the proposal.They don't sign them, they timestamp them.I like this proposal a lot, it would require an extra field in transactions (a large nonce) and a little change to the isStandard check.Make the target inversely proportional to the amount and it's all good.The problem isn't so much with having them in a block but have them relayed by the network. Maybe he should make a public statement about what he expects Avec du liberty reserve tu peux en acheter sur mtgox et sur bitcoin-central avec du pecunix tu peux en acheter sur bitcoin-central. FYI : Bitcoin-Central.net now supports two-factor authentication using google authenticator.Code is here. @Jered Kenna : I wouldn't really insist on this one if I was you, thanks for bringing it to my attention... Fixed that for you To mint = Frapper de la monnaie. I gave freeborn info on how to setup bitcoin-pool, waiting for feedback to add what they think is missing Ahem, plus la difficulté est élevée plus le réseau est sûr, parce que plus la difficulté est élevée plus il faut de puissance pour pouvoir réaliser un double-spend. Ce serait vrai avec une infinité de décimales. A partir d'un certain bloc il n'y aura plus de bitcoins générés du tout. There is discrepancy between your imagination and reality. Tu peux visiter mais pas poster.Je pense que ce mec était un malade mental, pas un troll Mais c'est vrai que les bans d'IP c'est moyen Les noeuds de sortie tor ne peuvent de toute façon pas poster sur le forum.Je pense que c'est le mieux, on débloquera les IP quand il aura trouvé un autre forum à polluer et qu'il nous aura oubliés  Definitely no.Doesn't mean you shouldn't give the code owner a couple of hours to fix it and advertise the deadline.You can only be sure if the source is open  It's http://blockexplorer.com/Owner is theymos
Quand je dis initialiser, c'est initialiser une structure de données, en réservant de l'espace mémoire.Un bout de code parle plus que 10000 mots : https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-pool/blob/master/lib/bitcoin/block_header.rbC'est une classe que j'ai codée pour manipuler des block headers, n'hésite pas si tu as des questions ou si tu veux la version en C.Grosso modo c'est un structure qui fait 160 octets.Code:# Block header          : 160 bytes  # - Version             : 4 bytes  # - Previous block hash : 32 bytes  # - Merkle root         : 32 bytes  # - Timestamp           : 4 bytes  # - Bits                : 4 bytes  # - Nonce               : 4 bytesLa version ne change pas, le previous block hash, référence la checksum du block précédent (un hash de 32 octets), la merkle root c'est le hash des hash de toutes les transactions enregistrées dans ton block (en gros si tu changes une transaction ca invalide la merkle root), un timestamp qui, une fois figé, donnera le moment ou le block a été miné, je sais plus a quoi sert le champ bits, et enfin le nonce, tu vas faire varier le nonce afin de faire changer le résultat de ton hash de block, une fois que le hash < seuil tu as miné un block. Tu veux dire, quel est l'algo à implémenter pour le minage ?Si c'est ca ta question alors la réponse est plutôt simple et bien documentée (en C, en Ruby ou en assembleur), les grandes lignes c'est : - Initialiser un BlockHeader - Initialiser un nonce à zéro dans le BH - Faire un hash SHA256 du block header et ensuite un hash SHA256 de ce même hash - Comparer la valeur à un seuil - Si la valeur est inférieure au seuil tu as trouvé un block, sinon tu recommences en incrémentant le nonce Les transactions offline c'est en cours.Il y a un post de grondilu qui explique comment générer des adresses bitcoin avec just openssl et une paire de fonctions bash, j'ai trouvé ca très élégant et je m'en sers pour stocker mes bitcoins dans un classeur et les photocopier  Les changeurs sont autorisés uniquement à faire du change manuel sur les devises ayant cours légal ainsi que les travelers chèques libellés en devises. Je n'ai pas le pouvoir de bannir un utilisateur, ni de bannir une IP.Par contre j'ai des liens "Delete" et "Edit" qui sont bien pratiques.Notre ami dérangé se lassera assez vite je pense s'il voit ses posts disparaître et que personne ne lui répond.Donc je ne vais pas m'embêter, j'efface à vue et sans sommations ses threads et messages, ignorez-le, ne le quotez pas, comme ca ca ne fera pas de trous dans les threads quand ses posts disparaîtront.Je vais voir si c'est possible d'avoir un ban d'IP You sound like a .Net developer, you probably are one Yea better store the passwords in plaintext, that'll be a nice performance optimization. FTFY Fais une petite recherche sur ASICS ou FGPA, j'y connais rien, je sais juste que ca existe, que c'est plus lent qu'un GPU mais qu'au niveau conso électrique c'est quasiment rien. Y a du vrai.La solution que j'utilise c'est clef usb + papier pour tout bêtement imprimer mes clefs privées. Tu devrais essayer de proposer tes services sur les forums en anglais.Au niveau programmation y a déjà pas mal de monde, par contre, au niveau électronique je pense qu'il y a beaucoup de choses à faire, je pense notamment aux circuits qui peuvent être utilisés pour le minage de bitcoins, les ASIC il me semble.Bienvenue  Non mais la il a clairement dépassé les limites des bornes De toute façon je suis pas sur qu'on s'en débarasse aussi facilement :/ Justement non. La sécurité est pensée à base de privilèges, d'utilisateurs, de masques, de chroot etc.That's not a bug, that's a feature baby.Citation needed ? Sur une variante de debian, à part l'installation d'un .deb je ne vois pas.C'est de l'open-source, tu es responsable...Par ailleurs ou est l'incompétence ? Recommander SELinux pour résoudre un problème qui pourrait être résolu plus simplement avec l'encryption à la volée du portefeuille ? (autrement dit, recommander un bazooka pour tuer un moustique, n'est pas nécessairement un signe de grande compétence...) J'ai du le mettre dans hors-sujet parce qu'il ne rentrait pas vraiment dans les autres catégories, encore une fois, n'hésitez-pas à me dire si vous n'êtes pas d'accord. Si ton client parle de transaction générée, ca veut dire que tu as le droit de dépenser (tu peux dépenser un "out" de transaction) l'out d'une transaction "coinbase" (génération).La plupart du temps, la transaction coinbase d'un block référence une seule out de 50 BTC, dans le cas d'eligius il y a plusieurs outs dans la transaction coinbase du block miné. Tu peux détailler ? J'ai demandé à ce que papion soit banni.Raisons : - Aggressivité/impolitesse envers les autres, - Détournement de threads assez systématiques, - Trolls permanents thread verouillé, dites au revoir à notre ami papion Le coût du traitement des transactions augmentera, à terme, le montant minimal de transaction (sous-entendu, les transaction fees seront prohibitives), rendant le système peu performant et peu adapté comme moyen de micro-paiement.(C'est en gros l'idée du §, que, à terme, bitcoin ne sera pas adapté pour les micro-paiements)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor Wish granted
Tu prononces ca comment "week-end" ?  Si si, c'est bien ca. Une adresse est dérivée de la clef publique (hash de la clef puis conversion en base58 il me semble). On peut générer une adresse à partir d'une clef publique, mais on ne peut pas retrouver la clef publique à partir de l'adresse. Sauf dans le cas ou l'adresse a déjà envoyé des bitcoins, dans ce cas la, sa clef publique est connue.La raison est que le client est obligé d'envoyer le solde complet d'une adresse à chaque transaction, c'est du tout ou rien. Il peut combiner le solde de plusieurs adresses que tu contrôles, dans la plupart des cas, la somme des soldes est supérieure au montant de la transaction, dans ce cas il te renvoie la différence, en arrière plan, à une nouvelle adresse qui t'appartient et qu'il a généré à la volée, c'est cette adresse qu'il faut avoir sauvegardée également. Ce n'est pas une question de "validité" de fichier. Tu as réussi ton test d'entrée Bienvenue! Pour dépenser un bitcoin, tu dois être en mesure de signer un message avec une clef privée contenue dans un fichier sur ton ordinateur.Si tu perds le fichier portefeuille (wallet.dat), le bitcoin existe toujours mais ne pourra jamais plus être dépensé, à moins que quelqu'un ne génère par hasard la clef privée qui permet de le dépenser ce qui est astronomiquement improbable. Oh, I wasn't really mentioning you I meant that if there are authentication frameworks available for your language you should use them. For example if you do rails, then use the devise gem. Tu développes en PHP ou dans un vrai langage ?  Protip : don't write/rewrite a login system, use someone else's Je ne doute pas que les clefs soient valides, par contre voila ce que je lis sur le site de M$ sur les licenses Microsoft Developer Network (http://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/subscriptions/aa948867.aspx)Voila, si ca se trouve c'est parfaitement légal de revendre ca à des clients, (je n'ai pas lu de contrat de licence en détail pour être franc), je suis pas le dernier à installer un windows cracké sur une virtualbox quand j'en ai besoin, ceci dit je préfère qu'on évite la vente de logiciels dans des conditions à la légalité douteuse sur ce forum.Que tu aies déjà installé des logiciels avec des clefs MSDN chez des clients, que tu sois invité aux salons Microsoft etc. n'a pas vraiment de rapport avec la légalité de la revente des licenses...Donc pour les licenses MSDN on va éviter, je n'ai aucun problème avec le reste, merci  Who whitelisted you ? xD A quel point ca peut recouvrir ce que fait le GLBSE ? * davout raises hand Tu pourrais donner un exemple, j'ai du mal à voir ce que ca pourrait donner concrètement.En gros ce serait une place de marché d'actifs décentralisée dont les transactions sont enregistrées dans une blockchain ? C'est pas dérangeant du tout, moi je pense simplement que s'il ne répond pas c'est que la réponse est oui  You need to appreciate the incredible elegance of grondilu's solution A newb will just copy a wallet to a couple USB sticks. I guess newbs are not the intended audience for this thread. T'es de la police ?  What exactly is the issue ?  un google docs serait pas mal, ou même une page du wiki, il vaut mieux y aller progressivement,personnellement si je dois relire je préfère y aller par petites itérations Honestly I'm a total crypto-newb, this is why I'm watching this thread with lots of interest I guess what you state is an advantage for yubikeys right ? Passwords that are valid for 30 seconds only, generated by an app or a hardware device.Having the database would be of no use in that regard. +1 
How about you don't derail this thread and stay away if you don't want to do business with bitcoin7 ? Thank you. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/305 Thanks a lot, I'll look into it So you're saying that if I want to setup such a mechanism without relying on google accounts I need to modify the google authenticator for every single device I want to support ? (and then maintain the apps). Or am I missing something here ? ca a peut-être changé depuis le temps, mais il me semble que t'es obligé de passer par windows pour modifier les voltages en flashant le bios de ta carte graphique, c'est pour ca que j'ai jamais modifié le voltage de ma 5970  doesn't that only work for signing-in with a google account ?Somehow I really like the idea of optional second step that people can buy from a third partythink harder Yes they do, you can fund accounts and withdraw EUR in SEPA zone for the price of a domestic bank transfer (mostly free).Also, they did offer international withdrawal options if specifically requested. BTW they *are* registered as companies where they have accounts, their US entity is called "Mutum Sigillum" and is based in Delaware. If someone donates a yubikey I'll implement the two factor authentication in bitcoin-central's codebase so anyone can open an exchange with awesome security out of the box.If someone's interested PM for postal address. According to MT the french bank account belongs to a company that simply forwards payments and bills the japanese legal entity 2% of the amount for this service, so I don't really think it's illegal at all.Info about the french company is here.Looked it up a month ago didn't see anything weird, but as I'm looking today I notice the "Société radiée le 29/10/2008" mention, which basically means "closed since 29/10/2008". Really weird, I downloaded the associated legal documents, I'll find them and double check.That's not really a problem, the real problem is to get a bank in a respectable country to open you a bank account. If you incorporate in Belize, good luck finding a bank that'll open you a bank account in France, and if you open a bank account in Belize, good luck finding people that will accept to wire small amounts for huge banking fees, and good luck finding people that'll transfer large amounts to a tax haven using a bank wire (and don't care if they bring attention to them doing that.)The problem is definitely non-trivial  va sur irc C'est probablement parce qu'il n'est pas assujetti à TVA. En France, un auto-entrepreneur peut émettre une facture, il dispose d'un n° SIRET, mais n'a pas de n° de TVA intra-communautaire étant donné qu'il n'y est pas assujetti (dans la limite de 32.000 EUR de CA annuel pour une activité de services). contradictsExchanges need to be registered, I'm running one and the reason I'm not currently accepting EUR wires is that I want to feel safe, and not vulnerable to legal hazard.My opinion is that since bitcoin is not legally recognized as a currency (in France at least) it should either be considered as : - a security (fungible asset) - a generic service (me selling bitcoins to you = me providing the service of signing a transaction we mutually see as acceptable)AFAIK, the only way to legally run a bitcoin exchange is to buy coins from people and then sell them to other people (in a single transaction).So the exchange would have to act as a counter-party to users.It's not feasible in France though. The reason is that if I buy a 1 BTC for 1 EUR from a user, I'll have to immediately resell it adding VAT, which in France is 19.6%.So you'd be buying one BTC from me at 1.20 EUR even though I bought it at 1 EUR (and I wouldn't be making any profit at all). Si tu te débrouilles en anglais, je te conseille d'aller sur #bitcoin-dev et de demander à artforz, diablo-d3 et al.Ils auront certainement des réponses pour toi  I can tell you're not running an exchange... nice Fait, du coup j'ai bougé pas mal de topics.N'hésitez-pas à me dire si je me suis trompé dans le rangement. Well, according to the description, bitcoin tools will output all the keys. But it seems to me like it's much more convenient to put all the coins in a single address before exporting its key.What I like with the print-a-key approach is that you need much less space than actually printing the full wallet. It opens the way to lots of interesting possibilities, for example I can get the key engraved inside of a ring, learn it by heart, you name it.You might also be interested in how to bury some bitcoins without even installing the client (windows users can use cygwin if they really don't feel like getting a real OS ) +1 Check this out, scroll down the page on github, you'll see the usage instructions.EDIT : Oh, and you might also be interested in the big bold "Download" button on the same page.Yup, that is correct.Fixed that for you, because now you know  
Frozen bank accounts are relevant. Tu mets un wiki/google docs en place ? Well, you extract it from your wallet using gavin's bitcoin tools, and then you... print it ?A newbie that knows how to run a plain script with a couple of arguments could do it I guessWell, this thread is about printing wallets to paper, if you're not interested, please refrain from polluting it. +1 to UV ink tattoo  Theoretically you can do much simpler, just print out the keypair after sending coins to the public key  It would have been a violation of their own terms : "mtgox does not act as a counter party to any trades". Interesting, I'm inclined to think that if anyone owned half a million coins, then he wouldn't have stored them on mtgox, unless it felt like home  Entièrement d'accord 1. La revente de licenses MSDN est interdite2. Ces licences ne t'appartiennent même pasThread verrouillé. Merci de ne plus proposer ce genre de services sur ce forum. you made my day Non, mais un minimum d'activité avant de faire de la pub pour une loterie aurait inspiré un peu plus confiance. Tu as du développer ton site un certain temps avant de le lancer, pourquoi ne pas avoir enregistré un utilisateur au moment ou tu as commencé à développer ce service ? Bien évidemment, ça ne prouve rien, mais moi ça m'active une première sonnette d'alarme qui est la suivante : "c'est probablement une identité jetable".Dans ce cas la, fais le bien. Ton e-mail laisse fuiter pas mal d'infos Et puis j'aurais tendance à dire que l'anonyme, c'est l'utilisateur final, pas le fournisseur de service, bon, sauf silk road bien sur.En te creusant un peu la tête tu peux construire un système qui se base sur les hashs des blocs publiés, tu décides à l'avance que le tirage est fait par le bloc N et tu donnes une manière déterministe de choisir une adresse bitcoin gagnante à partir du hash du bloc. En tant que joueur je peux vérifier à l'avance la liste des addresses qui jouent, vérifier leurs paiements dans le block explorer, et vérifier que je reçois bien le bon montant si je gagne (et je peux vérfier que j'ai gagné de manière indépendante). Ca c'est un système qui tient la route. Je pense que tu as eu ta dose en remarques constructives Si l'impression que dégage ton site t'indiffère c'est ton problème. La page est vague, ne donne pas de pourcentage de retour et donne une adresse bitcoin malgré le message qui invite à s'inscrire pour investir.

What is your question exactly ? If you need someone to feed you an already made PHP solution I think you're out of luck :If what you want is use my code you just need a ruby interpreter Je veux bien donner un coup de main. Ca sent l'arnaque Fixed that for you.  Transactions can be pruned under certain conditions, read satoshi's paper if you haven't already. Maybe you should add payment methods progressively and take enough time to thoroughly test them instead of rolling trades back after the fact. Just saying.I'll give you a little piece of advice, I don't mean to lecture to you or stuff but your official statement missed two things : "We apologize" and "it's fixed now". Here's how I would have communicated about that : "We made a little a mistake while implementing this payment gateway, we didn't properly check that the payment was final before crediting the user account. This is now fixed. We apologize to our users for the inconvenience and will do our best to not make the same mistake again. We didn't have a choice but to rollback the trades that came after this bug because <insert bad excuse here (because there really isn't any good excuse to rollback trades)>".Your communication so far makes it look like you threw something together pretty fast in order to get your share of the bitcoin exchange market without taking enough time to thoroughly test the software. Being generally dismissive (towards users, and security flaws reporters) doesn't really help either.My point basically boils down to : change the way you communicate and you will reap lots of benefits in term of positive user feedback and general perception. Yes If I get you correctly, you credited a user account based on the micropayment.de information before it was fully confirmed ?This credit was then used to buy coins before you decided to reverse the trades because the payment finally appeared as being fraudulent ?Is this correct or am I missing something ?  you're merely an annoyance You wish your posts were subversive, they were just vulgar. Bitcoin-Central.net is open source.Handles LRUSD, LREUR, EUR, Pecunix Gold out of the box.Has been using secure password storage since a long time  gtfo We are basically saying the same thing I suggest to not rely on listtransactions to monitor generated blocks.The approach I use is the following : - track shares with upstream_result = 'Y' - calculate block hash directly from the share result (block header) - use the getblockbyhash RPC call to do the tracking and validate there's actually a block that has been generatedI think it's a much cleaner approach
Yes that's right, I guess  I associated bitcoin7 with the e-book scammers a little fast :/So, even though there might be a couple of technical issues on the site (that seem to be worked on), I don't see any reason to question their honesty at all. I apologize to bitcoin7 about that. I just posted code to exploit the vulnerability to show how simple it was. Imagine how much you'd have in your account if you sold a couple thousand coins  Fine, I guess the thread title really is overly sensational. I'll just lock the thread a let this sort itself out. Honestly I have no proof but I feel there's something funny going on, a handful of newbie accounts created for the sole purpose of promoting the site, some weird website having popped up asking you to spam your friends to download an e-book with supposedly an easy way to make bitcoins full of links to bitcoin7.comI don't know, I guess the thread's title is a little harsch, but I would personnally stay far away from it. niceSomeone ban the retarded scammers please, they'll come up with a better scheme next time. Thanks for bumping  There is no such thing, the precision can theoretically be increased. If they happen not to be I'll apologize, I just wanted to share this tingling feeling that gets stronger and stronger with each post I read on the subject of their popped-out-of-nowhere exchange. Stay away from bitcoin7They smell very fishy, there are a bunch of threads popping around about it Haha, yea, don't worry, I'm calmy, coldly and logically coming to the conclusion that bitcoincoom, and maybe you, are the (or one of) the bitcoin7 guy(s). I feel strongly that it's a big fat scam, but that's just a feeling for now. Gonna have some ben & jerry's ice cream and watch the next events with amusement  Yeah that's great man. But what's your interest in this ?If you found such a great mining method you would have kept it for yourself...If you wanted to share it out of altruism altruism you would have just posted your method in good-ol' plaintext right hereOn the other hand, if you tried to get javascript miners injected all over the internet you would probably have registered a couple of forum users, got out of your way to register a domain, take time and create a web page, advertised it on the forum, and... OH. WAIT A MINUTE... No. I saw code that was trivially exploitable.This code got fixed because some honest people pointed it out previously in this very thread. (Did you thank them at all ? ) That just doesn't work. Because not only do your hackers have to be competent, they also have to be honest. And that's a whole different story... * davout thinks that only some 3 random posts newbie makes a positive comment about it, without saying a single word about why it's so cool and how it justifies spamming your friends  -- smells fishy Lots of good ideas here, going to cherry pick a bunch for BCs todo-list.These should go on every single form actually.Yes, it is  * davout wget's the URL to check for malicious code EDIT : Just sounds like a lame attempt to get people to use some javascript miner and tweet/facebook-share some message, (maybe about bitcoin7 who knows)... haven't tried  I don't speculate, I point at hard facts.You were vulnerable to one identified CSRF exploit, you fixed it, good.You still didn't make any statement regarding the amounts storage, the options are : - "We use floats because we don't have a clue about handling money in a database" - "We now use decimals instead of floats because we understand the exact implications""we store amounts very precisely", "we're monitoring the site closely", "trust us!", "we don't want to communicate about it", "davout is mean", "<insert random marketing talk here>" are not acceptable answers.I'm not making any assumption regarding your honesty, I'm making statements about technical matters and I have no problem being corrected if I happen to be wrong (see previous posts).Now I suggest you get your code straight and be open about it.This is an outright lie. It was trivially exploitable.more marketing talk...Check his source, of, wait a minute, only bitcoin-central.net is open source and correctly stores passwords using bcrypt (yes, hashes and salts are good but bcrypt is much better ) it's yours that i'm going to exploit for the lulz It's not that they didn't fix it that's disturbing, it's the fact they don't even acknowledge it is an issue that is.
Well, actually no, they could have said something like "hey yeah that's right, we should store amounts in decimal, not in floats", but instead, the answer was pretty much just marketing talk. please read the whole thread I stand corrected on this one Still easy to exploit.Malicious page has an 1px * 1px iframe displaying the withdraw page, populates and posts form through javascript with the added bonus that it can parse the DOM to figure out your exact (well floating point exact XD) BTC balance before withdrawing it.* davout heads to bitcoin-central.net to add a PIN code  That's ridiculous, the CSRF exploit is trivial, someone logged into your site, visiting a malicious site can have all his funds withdrawn at a whim.something along the lines of this :Code:<form id="maliciousForm" method="post" action="theWithdrawPage">  <input name="amount" value="42" />  <!-- other fields in your form --></form><script type="text/javascript">  $('maliciousForm').submit();</script>And that's only the first thing that has been spotted.Advice : shut down your site, get some professionnals, open it back up when it's finished and secure. People, this already exists, has been existing for a long time.See bitcoin-otc + bitmarket.eu I can totally relate to that !Kids remind us about the really important things in life  It's not a personal opinion, to my honest knowledge, bitcoin is nowhere (yet) considered as money. Had it been considered as money in France I would have gone for the currency exchange license, which is approx. 38k which is not very much.Yes, I think that's how events are likely to unfold in the US.Yes, don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing that one *should* incorporate in the US.That would be really great and very appreciated  Bitcoin is not considered as money in any jursidiction I know of. you are an amateur.some professionalism maybe ? You can see recent big deposits since mtgox moved a shit-ton of coins in a single transaction a couple of days ago, these deposits are probably big dark orders now.But otherwise no. Yes, I concur, an AML policy should be part of any decent exchange. We're back to the basics : get a lawyer. So that's what I thought, you don't have the slightest clue about how to properly handle currency amounts in professionnal applications.Go check the source-code of bitcoin-central.net, that's how the real pros do it baby  that would be really bad dr.bitcoin should first clarify what exactly is only possible in the three mentioned jurisdictions I can buy and sell bitcoins in the EU without any problem, I can even sell to someone and simultaneously buy from someone else with a small spread, what would be wrong with that ? You do not understand the difference between float and decimal do you ? Untrue Now that is an argument that makes lots of sense. If you have enough you pretty much always trade dark, because you usually don't want to move the market either way. So I think it's not perfectly accurate but it's a reasonable assumption nonetheless.You might argue that people put big normal orders to attempt to shift the market one way or another, but they probably even out.Guess only mtgox knows  ctrl+c, ctrl+v, that's not worth 10 btc, that's just stupid meh ?
link ?  The representation is pretty accurate nonetheless IMO, if you assume dark orders are evenly distributed. I feel your pain my friend. Hey, got your PM.The hardest part about setting an exchange up is not the technical part. It's the legal part.I suggest you sort that out first, how will you operate, which jurisdiction, where will your bank accounts be, etc. etc.When that's cleared out of the way, hit me up and I'll help you set up the bitcoin central code base for pretty much free.Don't start by spending time on the technical side of things until the legal side is clear.If you're serious about it, get a lawyer Bitcoins aren't a currency, one could deal with them using the less-than-1kUSD/customer/day MSB license exemption Isn't the whole you-need-X-posts-to-do-Y a bit counter-productive and leading to people posting less interesting content in order to reach X posts ? The question I was asking myself is then why in one big obvious transaction that leaks a fair bit of information ?I don't really know what you mean by "assigned to users accts." but I don't think it was ever the case, even the bitcoin client itself does not maintain links between addresses and accounts. MagicalTux is a smart guy, if he really wanted to consolidate all the coins he would probably have dispatched them to multiple addresses.Because even if highly unlikely address collisions could occur, but a better reason would be to not leak so much information, because with that transfer I can see how much money was sent in, at what time it was sent in etc.Again, I'm just curious There's absolutely no way to know from mtgox's public info that there is a bot hiding the amount of a big order by placing small orders at chosen moments.There's usually no way to tell there's a bot at all.I never said people weren't already. If there is no possibility to place a dark order, then people will make their big orders look small by placing them using a bot, therefore you will never have the information detail level you want. Is it that hard that to understand ?This has been discussed countless times on the forums, lurk a little more. I mean, go make your own exchangeControl freaks are people who say "everyone needs to do this now because blah blah blah" instead of "i'm doing this because i think it's smarter", and I don't usually lose time with control freaks.As for your logic, remove dark pools and people will use trading bots (and then you'll probably start complaining about how 'unfair' they are, and about how they leave you with 'incomplete' information, and how the world is going to collapse if people don't listen to your insightful rants). Stop being a control freak, and put your two little hands at work where your mouth is. Sandwiches... thats such a sick and disgusting perversion Appartently you don't need to have a soul to have a flawless logic Well, what sounds terrible to me are the forbidden "happy endings". But I'll have to admit that  "I'm throwing naked women at you therefore your argument is invalid"  sounds like basic common sense to me. But that's probably because I'm over 17  Probably because you're being naughty. You make no sense. They just have been deposited at mtgox, not bought by it. It's tl;dr and even that looked too longtl;dr : make your own exchange Ugh. for the n-th time, this is mtgox's users money, not its own Can't happen, addresses have built-in checksums. Maybe...This sounds unlikely, the wallet would just have been copied over, consolidating all the funds makes them very obvious.Yea maybe, that's why it sort of looks like some sort of an emergency move...
You seem to lack some understanding about the very bitcoin fundamentals.yes, finally some common sense good question, from a maintenance point of view it doesn't really make sense, well it could, but then it would probably have been advertised in advance.from a privacy point of view it's absolutely nonsensical, now everyone knows how much BTCs are in the bank, and everyone knows that hacking mtgox has a big bounty attached (well not that anyone would have doubted it in the first place, but now there's an actual figure)if thats the full mtgox balance being moved it also means you can pretty much see withdrawals in real time for the next couple of days, that's a nice information leak.i'd be curious to know the actual answer  LOL Trades seem to be happening again  You don't seem to get it, he didn't move *his* money, he moved *my* money.I think it smells funky, because if it was about consolidating coins that would have been a scheduled maintenance, anyway, consolidating coins to a single address is pretty pointless...That's really stupid, my USD balance isn't stored in the blochain. a spine and a finger are sufficient to click on a couple of links in the block explorer Because I know how to read the fkn blockchain. I don't have any insider info, I just know how to read the blockchain. This transaction (432kBTC) is MtGox moving money.Why is mtgox moving so much money ??Compromised server ? Japanese governement raid ? Routine maintenance ?Something smells pretty fishy...I'll be very reassured when trading is possible again and funds withdrawable... This *is* mtgox moving money d'affiliation? Doesn't work. You can copy bitcoins. Oh I see, that makes sense.The answer is that I don't compute the block number.I don't think there is something like a block ID, there can be multiple blocks at a point of time with the same height (same previous block) and (theoretically) multiple blocks with the same hash. Theoretically it's also possible, even if tremendously unlikely, to have different blocks, at the same height, and having the very same hash.I wondered about how finding about it though, didn't find a satisfying solution and ended up dropping this issue altogether since I don't really need it in my context.Please someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think the only way to get the block number without relying on an external service is to simply maintain a linked list of the whole block  chain's headers starting from the genesis block and count the items of the list. Your example only works in the very specific context of two clients with roughly 50% hashing power each.The attack/bug you describe is absolutely impossible with more than two equally distributed implementations.The moment you introduce a C client that has 33% of the network power, a bug in client B will have no other consequences than to trigger a couple of chain reorgs for B miners before someone notices something is wrong in the B client implementation. End of story.That's why I think and maintain that the point you spread is pure FUD. It will continue to operate, I just need to take thirty minutes, wipe the DB of testnet blocks and shares, and plug it on main net  Laisse tomber la GTX, les GPU nVidia sont très largement moins efficaces pour le calcul de hash, ils sont optimisés pour les calculs en virgule flottante, les GPU ATI sont optimisés pour les calcules en virgule fixe/entiers, et c'est ca qui les rend beaucoup plus performants pour le calcul des hash SHA256 Je t'avoue que j'en sais rien, quand je minais, je minais sous linux avec le ATI SDK qui te donne des outils en ligne de commande pour voir tes différents GPU reconnus et changer les options (xfire, oclocking etc)Le seul conseil que je puisse donner c'est utiliser le sdk 2.1 et pas le 2.2, et désactiver le crossfire pour les gpu ATI Tkt, je minais déjà tu jouais encore avec ton caca  +1Quand t'as fait un soft de trading t'as fait 2% du travail.Je vois un cabinet d'avocats mercredi soit dit en passant Ils vont me prendre des honoraires scandaleux  chaque calcul de hash est indépendant, il n'y a pas de sauvegarde qui fasse sens La censure ca ira merci, définis ce qui est bon pour toi, les autres verront pour eux mêmes.Perso je suis fumeur mais j'essaie d'arrêter ><
Source is now available : https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-pool Every method obviously has its flaws, it's up to you to pick what makes the most sense, paper has its own advantages that electronic storage does not have, end of story. Are you serious ?You really didn't know that ?If you were just being sarcastic then sorry If you weren't you should consider using it to properly monitor generated blocks.Are you just polling bitcoind to check for new blocks from time to time ? upstream_result = 'Y' ===> you found a block, NULL ===> wait moar That's FUD and bullshit. Seriously, a wrongly implemented client? "fork the blockchain"? "split the economy"?Alternative clients are a good thing, so is protocol documentation If the mainline client is really complex to understand and hard to read then it would be a very good thing to have a high-level language client which source is easy to read.Mining is not really the point here, if you can check transactions and hash a block header then obviously you have everything you need to mine. So the distinction between clients than can mine and those who cannot is irrelevant. Certainly not, the block hash is derived directly from the share solution, see the class I pasted.Basically you initialize a BlockHeader object, feed it the share solution, from there it gives you accessors on the various block header properties (prev. block hash, timestamp, nonce etc.) and an accessor on the block hash.You can do :Code:b = BlockHeader.new(solution)b.block_hash=> "000000afbcd21..."And this doesn't hit any external service Hah, I'm not really competing Just wondering if you considered taking BCs source to build your very own exchange. I'm ok with that, I think it's fair since we both put lots of effort and loving into our respective contributions to the bitcoin community My version now has graphing too btw Bitcoin central does most of that, care to improve it instead of starting all from scratch ? He'd sell his coins first but then yes, he'd let us all know  That's just awesome.

It does sound like a good idea   The intended audience are developers, and it's perfectly usable for developers  Trojans can't read paper.You can also combine both So you would have to bruteforce your wallet open ?  The crontab looks fine.You can probably run PHP directly if you have the correct shebang line and the executable flag on the file Print the key in plain text in multiple copies then, put it in a couple of sealed envelopes at a notary office T'as essayé de les contacter ? Bitcoin est pseudo-anonyme tu ne sais pas a qui appartient une adresse, mais a part ca tu peux tracer tous les fonds.Ca c'est parce qu'on t'a correctement lavé le cerveau et qu'on t'a fait croire que la seule économie viable était une économie en croissance perpétuelle ou chaque année on gagne plus d'argent que l'année d'avant, que chaque année on consomme plus que l'année d'avant, que notre téléphone de l'année dernière doit absolument être changé tous les ans... etc...Peut-être qu'avec une monnaie déflationniste les gens achèteront tout simplement ce dont ils ont réellement besoin, ni plus, ni moins  You got access to the source code on github, the post served as announcement, everyone has access to the pool.bitcoin-central.net instance.Everyone had to be wiped out because I needed everyone to have a valid testnet address after switching to testnet. Aww, that's cute Ok, so testnet is pretty much another blockchain.As its name states it's a blockchain that is used for testing purposes, it works exactly like normal bitcoin mainnet, except for the coins that circulate on testnet have pretty much no value and are used to perform whatever tests you may want.Currently there are approx. ~30000 blocks on testnet and difficulty is below 100, makes it very easy to generate blocks, that's why I use it to test my pool. I can generate loads of testcoins and see how my pool reacts to an OK block, an orphan block, if payments to testnet addresses are handled correctly etc.To start your client in test mode simply close it and restart it with the -testnet switch, it'll then start to download the testnet blockchain up to its current latest block, and then you're good to go.Bitcoin block explorer and the bitcoin faucet both have a testnet mode that is very useful to view your generated blocks, or to get 50 testcoins sent to you. Well, to me you're making an analogy between the taste of salt and the sound of the ocean. That doesn't really make sense does it?Anyway, my point is that sometimes you can't compare stuff and you just have to accept that you're in front of something unknown and intriguing I have white hair and a balalaïka, your argument is invalid.I like the shakespeare sample Yeah, not arguing thatHahaha I was right you were wrong, I proved it to the world, I'm so much happier now than I was before!Well actually, I don't really remember where this started from I don't usually read english litterature, but I *do* have some shakespeare in english, guess I should read that instead if arguing with the rest of humanity on an internet forum  People sell coins to other people who buy them, they both have acceptable price they're willing to buy/sell for mtgox simply reports the trade that happened Je vois, la différence avec une assurance est que l'assurance fixe un prix en fonction du service attendu (plafonds, franchises etc.) mais aussi, et c'est ce que ne fait pas la SS, en fonction du risque que tu représentes, un homme et une femme cotisent de la même manière, ils ne paient toutefois pas le même tarif pour leur assurance auto, toutes autres choses étant égales.Intéressant, il n'en reste pas moins que le peuple pourrait le dénoncer s'il le voulait. Il me semble qu'il n'y a pas vraiment de consensus dans ce sens.Oui, mais dans la plus grande légalité T'as intérêt à planquer ton nintandoCa c'est juste, faux.C'est exactement ce que je dis, quand tu poses une question à l'administration fiscale par LRAR, la réponse s'appelle un rescrit fiscal, cette réponse engage l'administration, et supprime les 80% de pénalités en cas d'abus de droit. (tiens je l'avais oubliée celle la, ce bon vieil oxymore, l'abus de droit.... beurk)L'administration a 6 mois pour répondre, mais par contre, l'absence de réponse vaut réponse favorable il me sembleA mon avis, c'est pas demain la veille que le bitcoin sera reconnu comme devise, il n'a cours légal nulle part. A mon avis il tombe dans la catégorie des instruments financiers, à laquelle je ne connais strictement rien soit dit en passant.Avec un peu de chance il pourrait bénéficier du même statut que les travelers cheques et, à ce titre, être échangeable par les bureaux de change (simple à ouvrir, 38k de K minimum), ce qui serait le bonheur Hey slush ! what's up ?Can you please look the other way for a minute while I shamelessly hijhack your thread ? Thank you my friend !Ok, I just wanted to get a couple of nice souls help me finish the testing of my brand new to-be-open-sourced pooling platform !A couple of Gh/s pointed at me for about 30 minutes/1 hour should give me more than enough power to mine twenty or thirty blocks on testnet and allow me to test the payout code and reward splitting code.As said, the pool is currently mining on testnet, no reward at all here, only the pride of taking part in a delicious FOSS adventure !The pool supports long polling, please do notify me if you get lots of stales.Thank you very much for your help!And thank you slush for coding the only pool I've ever mined on ! <3 <3 <3EDIT : You will need a valid testnet address, go here  -> http://blockexplorer.com/testnet <- click around, and grab a random one EDIT2 : Point your miners at pool.bitcoin-central.net Personne ne se leurre à ce point rassure toi.C'est pareil pour l'or, si quelqu'un découvre un jour la pierre philosophale ta femme changera d'avis et préfèrera les diamants comme par hasard.Si tu as acheté de l'or au moment ou les cours sont hauts et qu'il corrige tu es dans le même cas que le BTC.La limite arbitraire au nombre de bitcoins n'est d'aucune importance étant donné qu'ils sont divisibles à l'infini, 42 aurait marché de la même manière. Ta cotisation SS dépend de ton revenu, pas du risque que tu représentes, ce n'est donc pas du tout une assurance.C'est le peuple qui l'a octroyé à l'état via la démocratie.Oui, mais ca on est au courant dès le début que certains reçoivent plus qu'ils ne donnent et inversement. Ce n'est pas une approche moins valable que l'approche américaine, elle est juste différente. Encore une fois, on est au courant à l'avance et on a la possibilité de choisir de ne pas jouer à un jeu dont les règles ne nous conviennent pas.Pour moi ca reste simplement des niveaux d'imposition scandaleux Le vol implique que tu n'as jamais eu le choix de partir ou de rester, si tu restes tu ne peux t'en prendre qu'à toi-même.Pour moi la première des libertés c'est de se rendre compte qu'on est libre, regarde MagicalTux, il a l'air très content d'être parti pour le Japon.Des risques légaux pour les utilisateurs et entrepreneurs. Par exemple en obtenant des rescrits fiscaux, en publiant des avis d'avocats, en mettant l'administration devant ses responsabilités en établissant des précédents. Les idées sont les bienvenues! These are two example configuration files, one for pushpool, one for blkmond which is used to notify pushpool of new blocks when longpolling is used It is not. If you make a coin that is 50% gold and 50% lead and you try to deceive people into thinking it is 100% gold that is forgery, not double spending.If you spend this fraudulent coin once the coin is then not in your physical possession anymore, therefore you cannot spend the same coin it a second time.Double spending = making a valid spend, waiting to collect its benefits, invalidating the first spend by making a double spend.Wait a bit, repeat. You can double spend for ever since you can have as much identities as you want.Of course, thats pretty obvious, it doesn't change the fact that at that point you will have spent the *same* coins twice (spend = give coins in exchange for a valuable benefit).Yes, unless you do it smartly and combine that with isolating nodes. We do agree that it's very unlikely/impractical.You fail to see the obvious "acceptance" point, bitcoin has the potential to be much better than gold as a currency, but as of today you're much more likely to get gold accepted as a payment in exchange for whatever good/service you randomly pick on the surface of the earth, if you fail to see this simple truth you're deluding yourself.
I don't feel bad about it, it was the price at that moment. makes sense, just note that rails has this awesome capistrano tool that everyone uses and that makes deploying on tons of server as easy as typing a command and inputting a password (litterally!)Also I've added you to the bitcoin-pool repo if you feel like looking at the source, just don't publish it please Don't feel bad, I sold 5K for 1500 I gave everything to the faucet, however I did set your address as payout address for testing my mining pool (http://pool.bitcoin-central.net) When the block count reaches 128964 you'll see the donation if you got the address from your client since the transaction was recorded in that block Je ne pense pas comme ca, j'étais bien content le jour ou la sécu a payé les milliers d'euros facturés suite à l'hospitalisation de ma fille, je suis bien content que la France prenne à peu près correctement en charge les handicapés, je serai bien content d'avoir droit aux ASSEDIC le jour ou je perdrai mon travail.Ceux qui ne sont pas contents n'ont qu'à partir ou voter, mais se plaindre et dire qu'on se fait voler n'a, à mes yeux, rien de constructif ou respectable.Oui, il y a du gaspillage à bien des niveaux de l'état, oui l'état intervient beaucoup, oui je préfèrerais payer moins de charges. Mais je suis un grand garçon, si je ne suis pas d'accord avec les règles du jeu, je ne joue pas au jeu.Si je cherche des solutions légales c'est pour que moi et mes utilisateurs puissent dormir sur leurs deux oreilles, pas grapiller 30% d'IS. Use autogen I don't actually own over 9000 At some point I did but not anymore  Oh I see, guess it's the closest approximation of the yen amount?So do the funds get wired back and forth from US/Europe to Japan ? Let me rephrase : what happens when US, France or both decide that bitcoins, and businesses involved in them should be shut down ? (i think the current silk road controversy makes this question more relevant than ever  ) That makes sense, so the 1000 USD limit reason is needed to allow the commercial intermediary to not fall under MSB regulations requirements, right ? Does it also imply that the funds wired in the US or France actually move to Japan at some point ?+1, mtgox is doing us all great good by remaining legal What are towncoins ?Use Ruby on Rails, I can't talk about Python/Django, but I know for a hard fact that Rails is to web frameworks what bitcoin is to fiat currency.Bitcoin-Central.net is also written in Rails and is already open sourced I have a question for you Mark (if it's not already birru-time in japan) : when are japanese and american laws relevant to mtgox operations since there are at least two companies involved in mtgox operations, one in the US and one in Japan ? Because it's considered a store of valueI think it is. Oops, sorry -> http://blockexplorer.com/testnetJust click around and grab a random addresswat?For now, nowhere, in a couple of days, from github Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous, not mtgox.Because if mtgox makes more than 1000 USD worth of transactions per customer per day it has to register as a Money Services Business under american law. And this is even making me wonder how they can legally "raise the limit" for certain customers.This is a legitimate complaint though.This has nothing to do with AML it has to do with getting an MSB license.I asked a question about the limits on some other thread, as of now I didn't get any answer even though subsequent posts were addressed. On a more general manner I think mtgox should be much much clearer about how exactly they operate, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they're proactively hiding this information, I'm saying that nothing is done to make it clear. To be completely honest, MagicalTux did answer pretty straightforwardly when asked about how transfers to their french bank account were managed. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specificationAlso, it's important that the client has no problem running on any arbitrary port. I tried to change the default port to have a mainnet and testnet client on the same box but the non-standard port client didn't get any connections. Maybe it's me that did something wrong, jsut saying.Aren't a bunch of node IPs already harcoded in the client ? (haven't got a clue about this one, but could be a good temporary fallback)IIRC jgarzik was arguing that the protocol version could be differentiated using a set of flags instead and that the protocol version field should be frozen, can't find that pull request anymore :/EDIT : That was in OPs post...

Through borders for example ? Yes, fair enough. But you seem to fail to realize that the first desirable property of a currency is acceptance.And *currently* gold is much better than bitcoin in that respect.You're describing making fake gold, not double spending gold. Bitcoin is much better than gold for forgery protection.Yes you can.There is no such thing as the absolute "true chain", it's all relative to a point in time, owning the network enables you to switch which chain is regarder as the "true one" at will. All first spends in double spends will reside in orphan blocks. No limit here.Theoretically there is absolutely no way for you to even be aware that the network is dominated by someone with >51% of the network.YesI'm not saying that gold is a better currency than bitcoin. I'm simply arguing that on this shitty and rainy 7th of June 2011, gold has much better currency properties than bitcoin.

Otherwise a simple keep-only-a-fraction-of-the-funds on the frontends will do just as well as the more complicated scheme that you outlined.I've read a fair bit of Bruce Schneier thank you  Haha good news, i totally need one. What makes you so sure about that ?Singapore also sounds like a nice place to hide money
Private URLs = security through obscurity,If you implement some authentication mechanism for accessing these URLs from the front-end server it makes the system dependent on the front end security (ie. compromise front-end, steal auth. keys, profit)If you implement some manual validation scheme, that is subject to transaction amount limits for example, then it can always be cheated by stealing the keys and submitting requests that wouldn't trigger manual validation.With this kind of schemes you're vulnerable to a vast array of MITM attacks.This problem is non trivial to say the least  meh If the difficulty remained constant it would be certain that solo mining would always be more profitable in the long run.I'm not sure that if you take difficulty bumps into account it's always more profitable, even on the long run, honestly I don't know. Fire him, hire me, I'm much more experienced, I know bitcoin-central's code by heart and I accept BTC  This is a mainnet address, you need a testnet address to receive testnet coins Bitcoin-Central.net does that out of the box.And good news, it's open source.You'll find the source here : https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-centralAnd a live instance here : https://bitcoin-central.netThis is a tricky problem.

Hmm, it appears it didn't get them...Hope I didn't accidentally send 15K real coins to the faucet XDAlso people, saying that you could use test coins is no big help, just post and address and how much you need, I have 5K left, I'll keep 1K for testing but the rest can be given away.tx id 43dc988e3f5cc08373720de1932c727d2d3a11a01d40ceebaea8896b675a2ad2Dunno about attacks, I've been mining @ 600 Mh/s against it for approx. 12 to 24h.That's also why I prefer giving away test coins than having people generate them, makes my testing faster  Ummm.

I argue that a mandatory minimal transaction fee is not the Right Thing(c) to prevent spam, keep load under control.This is a misconception, bitcoin is self regulating in this regard. If the block reward is zero and no fees are collectable the miners simply won't mine until people want transactions processed and start adding fees to their transactions, this point has already been discussed thoroughly.the Right Thing, copyright 2009-2011 Gavin Andresen
As I showed, the person who pointed that out can't do basic math, on average a GPU hashes 30 times faster than a CPU not 1000. http://blockexplorer.com/tx/5da8cf5ba4866b68f02c464b94cd1d87d11a1808dd8a0390997e439d205eb746Have fun  Did you try the faucet ? I think paper can be a very good storage medium that doesn't suffer from that are specific to computer storage.It's not a complete answer, but it has very interesting properties to store BTC.Implementing a QR code output is pretty trivial. I suspected it, but thought that only non standard txs weren't relayed, I guess that if a small transaction without a fee is considered non standard.However I don't think that the amount of a transaction is a sufficiently accurate heuristic to classify it as spam.It's obviously pretty hard to find good ones to tackle this problem, a couple of ideas : - go back to the grand-father of bitcoin and implement a hashcash like system with a hash target that decreases with the amount the transaction - statistical comparison of transaction amounts with the averages/medians of the last X hours/days etc. - simply limiting the amount of small transactions that can transit through a node in a given timespan Automatic transaction fees were put in place so that the network isn't DDoS'd, I argue that they should be removed from the client and the responsibility of charging for transactions should be passed to the miners.If someone really wants to DDoS the network they simply modify a couple of lines in the client.So I don't think it's an effective protection against anything if the miners themselves don't enforce the presence of a fee depending on the transaction they are processing. Yes, a hash of the hashes of the transactions is hashed in the block header, so if you add a transaction it invalidates your hash.However, when the block reward decreases miners might only start mining with sufficient transaction fees piled up. I like this idea, you should give more details about what exactly you want to do. I think this is a very bad decision too.But you just don't call people morons, especially when they give their time for building software you probably use. People unhappy about the default client settings are free Omg, run for the github repository, make a pull request, if you can't code, pay someone to do it, if you don't feel like it don't use this client.Either way the people who code the client don't owe you shit. Too much "should", "need", "we", too little "i've contributed", "come test my addition" etc. You need to wait a little more.The current block count is 128,782.To check for your transaction google "bitcoin block explorer" and then search for the bitcoin address the funds are supposed to go. Why only PHP ?If you're building apps from scratch there are much better alternatives. Open source trading platform :https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-central Hopefully results will speak for themselves  I'll release the fully functional app by tomorrow evening for a 24h test session against testnet and then it goes live.The app is ready, I'm busy on heavy automated testing right now. ArtForz does too AFAIK wow, finally a little bit of sanity in all this PHP mess  Do yourself a favor, do the switch to rails  OP is obviously a bitcoin forum summerfag.
You're right, I meant 10,000 KH/s or 10 MH/sSo yes, a rough approximation is that the average GPU is 30 times faster than the average CPU.That's why I like claims served with a side of nice numbers  1 decent GPU ~ 300 MH/s1 decent CPU ~ 10 KH/sWe probably don't have the same definition of "thousands". Wow, didn't know about that flag AFAIK the current GUI version still has the option to generate coins.It's obviously good for the network as a whole if you keep it on, but they're much more efficient ways of doing that.So yes, it's good, but it won't bring much extra safety to turn on generation on a stock client. Well, go for it, if you're confident that you can handle these issues it might be a nice opportunity.My gf plays sudoku on her iphone whenever she gets a chance : there is a market  Read "the restaurant at the end of the universe" you might then want to review your statement  +1 this is a pretty sweet PoCFTR grondilu is the man who started a full shell script implementation of the bitcoin client  Cheating is like an intellectual game.At some point you might just end up with a sudoku grid that hardly as readable as a captcha. Or you can check with requests.log +1 I would *not* do that. In a more general manner, store coins (long term) on a computer that has some sort of internet connection.The more I think about it, the more I feel that the best is to print your private key and store it in a safe in switzerland (or multiple keys for the matter, a key collision is highly unlikely, but you better be safe than sorry) i don't see how you could connect to pushpool with blank query logs Your miner has problems connecting to pushpool, check worker credentials when launching, and in DB, check worker query.Check query logs. And because I'm nice I'll tell you the problem is in the pushpool config file  try to run pushpool with$ pushpool --debug=2 --config=[your config file] --stderr --foregroundcheck your logs, normally /tmp/shares.log and /tmp/requests.log see if something funny appearscheck your bitcoin client's debug.log to see if pushpool sends getwork requeststriple check your DB configdouble check the filesystem permissions for the log files directoryif all of that fails direct your friends to an existing pool and erase system32 directory, it makes your computer fasteralso post your pushpool config, bitcoin config and the command line used to run a remote miner, maybe there's something obvious here upstream rpc error = pushpool has trouble connecting to the bitcoin client401 = wrong credentials I'd suggest to wait a little bit, I'll submit my contribution pretty soonGo for it  explain your problem better.can you launch the bitcoin daemon ?do you get a result when trying a command such as getinfo on the command line ?if yes, your bitcoin daemon is set up correctly, take this info, copy it in pushpool config for "rpc.user" and "rpc.password"this appears pretty clearly in the pushpool example config file tell them to use an existing pool  Definitely not, if you have have some spare cycles why not use them.
No, you have a problem with your passwords somewhere Nope, that's normal. Where is my cherished BBE ?  Yes, you need it only for long polling tho Here we go, if anyone is interested in the ruby BlockHeader class.Not very elegant, but it does the job : - Extracts block header fields - Computes block hashhttp://pastebin.com/y0sMZSbi  Thank you very much Hey !thanks for all the input !I found this piece of code, it's been really useful, now I manage to decode the block header and extract the different fields, I don't think it's a necessary step to retrieve the 2xSHA256 checksum but I just felt it would help my understanding. Thing is I'm doing something that shouldn't work, yet it somehow works... I can't get my head around it.So for example, to retrieve the previous block hash from the block header I thought I would have to do this : - Chop the string between position 8 and 8 + 64 to get a hex representation of the previous hash in little endian - Swap bytes to retrieve big endian representationSo, to swap bytes I first tried to reverse the string with chunks of two hex chars, "ab cd ef gh ij kl mn op" becoming "op mn kl ij gh ef cd ab". Didn't work out well.But for some reason I don't understand, doing that in chunks of 4 bytes (8 chars) yielded correct results ("ab cd ef gh ij kl mn op" -> "ij kl mn op ab cd ef gh")Looks pretty straightforward in the example code (which yields correct results btw when I hardcode my data sample) : - Take previous block hash in big endian - Swap bytes without chunks - Hash along with the rest of header dataMy code (missing the checksum part, and mysteriously succeeding at extracting merkle root and previous block hash) : http://pastebin.com/yVvvwRUd Or alternatively you can check the PID file that's configured in the config file This is pretty frustrating,  I'll pay 3 BTC to the person providing a Ruby solution (or that helps me code a working one )EDIT : Maybe there's something to do with endianness ? You can use an SCI of an existing bitcoin handling platform - MtGox - MyBitcoin - Bitcoin-Central.nethave it Maybe I'm doing something wrong but it doesn't really seem to work ...The original solution :Code:irb(main):038:0> str=> "0000000150c549978a44e3ef671a4ed3f5b922195ebde0fbbccfdb5900e6827000000000c8a03dfb42fa04d47e9fbfd3e6afcb3d0df2b516eb86f4e64d09fe53cc397b6c4de61f4c1c069652a228e13d000000800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080020000"I strip it down to the 160 first charsCode:irb(main):039:0> stripped = str[0,160]=> "0000000150c549978a44e3ef671a4ed3f5b922195ebde0fbbccfdb5900e6827000000000c8a03dfb42fa04d47e9fbfd3e6afcb3d0df2b516eb86f4e64d09fe53cc397b6c4de61f4c1c069652a228e13d"irb(main):040:0> stripped.length=> 160I pack it to a binary string :Code:irb(main):042:0> binary_data = stripped.to_a.pack("H*")=> "\000\000\000\001P▒I\227\212D▒▒g\032N▒▒\271\"\031^\275▒▒▒▒Y\000▒p\000\000\000\000Ƞ=▒B▒▒~\237\277▒▒\257▒=\r▒▒\206▒▒M  \376S▒9{lM▒L\034\006\226R\242(\341="Hash it a first timeCode:irb(main):043:0> first_pass = (Digest::SHA2.new << binary_data).digest=> "\025\\2\245▒ҏ\260\211\016D/▒ 0TM$T\aç=▒X\"\251▒▒+\001\276"Then a second timeCode:irb(main):044:0> second_pass = (Digest::SHA2.new << first_pass).digest=> "\276▒*{▒`h▒▒S▒4\230\254h\004n▒▒G\234;^\a\207M;5\016\250t"And then finally unpack the result back to hexCode:irb(main):045:0> second_pass.unpack("H*")=> ["bef9bc2a7b896068f9c253f23498ac68046ec9f5479c3b5e07874d3b350ea874"]Doesn't match the block hash...I feel like a total clueless noob on this one Any ideas ? Thanks a lot! I'll try that and post the results. Did you activate all the debug options ? (--foreground --debug=2 --stderr)  From my understanding you'd need to active blkmon so it monitors new blocks.It should then send SIGUSR1 to the pushpoold to notify it No one ? TL;DR : Share solutions, how do they work ?I've installed jgarzik's pushpool and it's successfully running against a bitcoin client running on testnet,Pointed a miner at it, generated a few blocks, now I need to track them, and link them to the share that provided the right solution.So I have a share where pushpool's result is "Y", upstream result is "Y", seems like it generated the block http://blockexplorer.com/testnet/block/000000000055825d01acc3dcc80d02671c2e75ab5b692940446e9b8615ea3824I do own the address and the logs show a share submission time that is the same as the block timestamp.The recorded solution for the share is Code:0000000150c549978a44e3ef671a4ed3f5b922195ebde0fbbccfdb5900e6827000000000c8a03dfb42fa04d47e9fbfd3e6afcb3d0df2b516eb86f4e64d09fe53cc397b6c4de61f4c1c069652a228e13d000000800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080020000and the block hash is Code:000000000055825d01acc3dcc80d02671c2e75ab5b692940446e9b8615ea3824So my question is, how do I get to the block hash from the submitted share solution so I can track these properly ? PHP coders are funny when they talk about security XD You're saying the server doesn't even ping ? Fixed that for you ecdsa
I do have something in the works, I'll put something online today.Maybe the bounty can be split if we release something in the same couple of days, maybe his feature list isn't complete yetWe'll see  It's not like there are 50 lead developers and 20 implementations of the client  Nice job !Do you plan on implementing the missing features so you can claim the bounty ? Is the regexp supposed to magically guess a meaningful name from a two or three letter variable name ? What about delayed statistics ? haha yrz, everything that can reasonably be approximated to the concept of "a client" induces this kind of frustration  What about score based rewards ? XD That's why your gf can't be interested in bitcoin, she's busy making them for you xD Yes, comments on the feature list are important if multiple projects are competing  Nice job!If I was you I'd expect people who made statements to stand by them  What do you mean "you don't see much interest in this project" ?People seem to have started working on this, I have and I'm planning on delivering a result.So either you honor your word, or you don't. FOSS -> Free Open Source SoftwareThe BTC part of the bounty will be enough for me.I think it'd make an awesome reference platform for anyone to build upon My deployments are avg. 15 seconds  One command to type, asks you for the server password, boom! deployedRails being complicated to deploy was true a few years ago, now it's just a myth. You just need apache + mod_passenger (just like mod_php, just apt-get it) and a database.Anyway, still waiting for the people who have advertised a BTC bounty to show up.I propose that the first project who manages to fully complete the feature list I posted gets the bounty. The person who escrows the bounty would be the judge.I'll resume working once the bounty is secured, I trust Rails so I'll let all the PHP guys get a head start  go for it, if you don't feel like it/can't then ... bounty! yay Well, I might be missing something here, but ultimately the point is to track generated blocks, along with their shares in order to calculate payouts.So monitoring solved blocks is pretty easy, it hardens a bit when you actually need to pay people based on their work. Yes, and at the end throw an extra 200 BTC bounty so all the features are integrated together Makes senseThat makes sense but doesn't help you link found shares to the block they are relevant to, does it ? It might start as one, but when the day comes it's possible to buy a pair of expensive shoes with it will be the day I encrypt my wallet  yepI approve of thisThis is fine too, just put an address up, once it reaches 130 BTC I'll publish the git repo.Like me ? I was asking myself the same question, but right now I only spent like an hour on it, I can manually register a worker and pushpool will correctly record shares.You might want to ask jeff garzik and have a look at this : https://github.com/jgarzik/pushpool/blob/master/example-blkmon.cfg : looks like there is some sort of block monitoring mechanism.If you get the block hash (see first question ) then I'd poll the client, or have it notify me on each block so I can track the confirmation status of the one that was mined by the pool, I'd pay some extra care though to correctly account for blockchain forks.If you want to throw in some funds then please use BTCs, if you don't have the 14 BTC then use your USD to buy yourself some, and if at this point your balance is 14 BTC then you should spend them in the economy or save them Yes, do yourself a favor, switch to ruby on rails  OTC is over the counter -> http://bitcoin-otc.com/People will rate you if they trade with you Not necessarily, but usually yes.I've heard people saying that you can charge paypal back only if you pay with a credit card, this might be completely wrong, feel free to call me an idiot. But if that's true it means that someone who transfers paypal credit to you that hasn't been funded with a credit card won't be able to reverse the transaction if something goes bad.In the opposite case you're putting yourself at risk.(Feel free to correct if my understanding of paypal is completely wrong)If you want some reputation maybe you should do some OTC trades.
I don't do paypal, I just don't really see what benefit you'd get out of it.

Work will start as soon as the bounty is sent/escrowed + 21 000 000 C'est pareil partout  LOL Funny we got that in french newspapers too yesterday. Heh, I would like the idea that it would be possible for every human being to hold one  Yup gavin's in France, NPR still managed to chase him down for an interview even in Paris  I would favor something different : when the decimal place is moved in the default implementation we just call "a bitcoin" whatever happens to be the smallest integer value after the decimal shift.Happened in France the other way around when we switched from "old francs" to "new francs" with a "new franc" being worth exactly 100 "old" ones.After a couple of weeks of slight confusion, everything would be back in order  You should change that, you're vulnerable to cheating calculating rewards this way. Yes you could definitely try something like that, just because windows declares it's corrupted doesn't necessarily mean it is. I think you stretched it as far as you could It was really awesome meeting all of you guys, I had a great time !yay! thanks a lot! [/quote]I don't think this place should be seen as a place to advertise bitcoin, if bitcoin succeeds it won't be because of good marketing, it will be because it solves a problem, because it puts the control of money where it belongs, in the hands which use it.If people desire a new subforum with different rules, why not ? But I don't think that project development should be removed and that too much attention should be given to marketing and PR.I don't think this place is about PR, and I'm also amused at the obvious "this is not a ponzi scheme anymore since i just told you it is one" paradox  Weren't you guys limiting transactions at 1000 USD per customer per day ? +1 I vote a plain fat no.
It was a pleasure Good luck with your business ! If it's too long, it should be structured, not removed Didn't try it but it does look simple and clean, always happy to see alternatives, especially a US based one.I found that implementing a robust trading algorithm being actually harder than I thought, so I don't know about testing frameworks in PHP but I do recommend heavy unit testing and particular attention to rounding bugs.I also recommend heavily using the transactional features of your RDBMS, not using MyISAM at all when using MySQL, and also pay attention and explicitly set high isolation levels. Someone reverts ? Sometimes it's a positive sign, for a website, to be able to survive despite a not-so-pleasing design  The first rule of tautology club is the first rule of the tautology club. This sounds like a very interesting project, I'll definitely do it. I'll post my conditions, requirements and a brief RFC tomorrow before going to meet with gavin and some fellow bitcoiners in Paris. Ask scrooge mc duck to buy 70k worth of BTC then  Just a (hopefully constructive) comment : you don't really see black backgrounds like that on well designed websites anymore, and in this specific case it's even likely that it's not going to fit at all, for a simple reason, it's not the best color to present auctioned items. Even more knowing that most of the times the items are shot with a clear/white background.Black would be perfect for an web browser sci-fi game, I would not choose it for an auction site/web shop. I perfectly understand, and would probably react the same way. I also completely agree with you, but taking offense and reacting like that when a ~50 posts user pokes them with an obvious unfounded claim/troll is IMO way more damaging than just plain ignoring the comment, isn't it ?I politely point out that when I quote someone, the quote is enclosed in quote tags.Wow you're much better at corporate talk than graphic design. This is not about your reputation, not at all, it's about your incredible ability to remind me of times where comic sans ms and blink tags were still ok.Take care, drop the corporate talk, and relax (seriously)  What this makes me think about : And here is a user testimonial : I have used your site a while ago, I don't remember encountering usability or functionality issues, but I definitely remember that your design striked me as being pretty unpleasant. And it's a well known fact that the user perception is never rational and objective, it's influenced by purely subjective factors such as color, layout etc.So maybe instead of "demanding documentation" and feeling threatened you should use this opportunity to improve and gather user feedback in a friendlier way.Just my 2 bitcents, take care  Wonderful, I'll be there at 12 probably, I'll wait smoking cigarettes and being an annoying french person Try downclocking a bit bitcoin is real cash, paypal is promise of debt money if you're nice Here you go, please indulge in a delicious github wiki : https://github.com/davout/bitbay/wikiIf you have a github account I'll add you as repo collab I don't mind giving a hand and donating some hosting.But first I have a couple of things on my list : - a killer feature for bitcoin-central.net - a web interface to jgarzik's open source pool if you're speaking about coal miners then you're on the wrong forumif you're advocating in favor of bitcoin miners cooperating i'd actually be against it  I don't do PHP, sorry try again  Language ?
http://www.biddingpond.com/EDIT : Not sure if serious... which is wrong as well Next step would be making a keyboard shortcut  The half is relative to a total amount which is arbitrarily set to 21M, a valid coin can be checked by going all the way back to its generation.And please do read the FAQ before thinking 21M isn't a very big amount Also welcome here http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf + Read FAQ please  Moi j'y vais, j'ai posé ma journée lol https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tonal_BitcoinAlso 6M BTC in existence, not 12  ITT : people that wish the US govt would ban BTC for all the free publicity  1st post on page 3 Yes, the more languages the better !When I code I'm able to maintain the french and english localizations, but that means some maintenance work has to be done on other localizations as well since functionality and thus strings get added/removed over time.When I have some time I might hack a little tool together that would show what parts need to be updated in the non english and french translations.Anyway, thanks again for the translation!I personnaly think esperanto's main use are the esperantist conventions. But if you feel like doing the translation I'll happily pull it in  +1I vote we don't give a fuck about bitcoin.com  US banning BTC = lots of free publicity = increase in usealso banning use of BTC = limiting freedom of speech = not gonna happen It does sound horrible What ?As I said no consistency is guaranteed by design, so the question of the OP is answered."Why doesn't the CAP theorem kill Bitcoin ?" :1. Because theorems don't kill things2. Because bitcoin does not guarantee consistency.Bitcoin only guarantees that it will try its best to make any inconsistency be solved eventually. Hey!thank you for the translations but the bounty was paid a fair while ago (see previous posts and githubs repo frontpage)Remember it's all open source, feel free to keep contributing, they are very appreciated ! Issue two notes with same barcode. boom! fractional reserve banking. Bitcoin does not guarantee this. LOL ...asks the sr. member  Enabling the option should be enough to start generating.But don't get your hopes up, you'll probably never generate a single block that way (depending on your hashrate (shown in the client))Google 'bitcoin calculator' to find out about your odds
Please read the FAQAfter that, if some things are still unclear feel free to come and ask. If VAT is charged on currency exchange, it would logically be charged only on the comission part, not the whole thing. Tout le monde utilise le chiffrement asymétrique, sans nécessairement le savoir  Il me semble que ca existe déjà. Your vessel will probably look somehow similar Bien sur que si, il suffit de créditer un compte pour faire un prêt.Elles peuvent prêter plus de bitcoins qu'elles n'ont en réalité, tant que tout le monde ne vient pas retirer ses fonds en même temps. Yea I understand, that's also pretty much why I'm still mining solo, I want the delicious smell of a freshly printed pure money to appear in my house  well i mean that the 10k tx out might have been used as an in for other txes along with other ones.Let's say the payee then spent 20k coins using two 10k ins and creating a single 20k out, then those 20k have half the original pizza smell go tell numismats all over the world they're all morons  This idea is amazing. But I think it's not really feasible, they have probably been thoroughly mixed with the rest of their little buddies  This idea, if implemented seriously, might have a non-negligible impact on global warming. please accept this picture of a potato as a token of friendship * davout is looking for a way to inject javascript on facebook The ad does sound kind of scammy Well, as long as it sparkles debate it's all good You'd be on your own The fundamental flaw here is comparing BTC with credit cards, bitcoins are comparable to cash, not to credit cards I bought around 600 worth of coins @ 0.8/coin when they were around .75$/coinCan't say I regret  Private property is not something obvious and universal.Are your organs private property ? You seem to imply so, but in most, if not all, countries you can't legally sell or rent them. Still private property ?There are multiple theories of property, and multiple conceptions of it that vary vastly through time, culture and countries : human beings could at some point be owned as "private property", owning land means different things in the US, France and the UK etc.So my point is that private property is imaginary in the way any mental construct is.Just be nice to others, and whatever your views are, you'll have a good time here  Yeah well, I still feel bad about picking on the socially challenged  Yeah, accept my apologies, that totally came out of nowhere. Thank god my brain is safe, doesn't seem like a vital organ in your case.
I need an improbability drive in my 5970 Had to deal with going abroad for work with little to no internet connection, and no family for a bunch of months.Can't say I aren't happy about having family and bitcoin community back Big big kudos to what you've done with the GLBSE ! +1 20,999,999.9769 BTC actually.Strength is to be measured relatively to the current technical possibilities, there's no such thing as "sufficient global hashrate".Please feel welcome here, help yourself to some lurking, let it rest a bit, realize that wanting to limit the hashrate of certain clients is pointless and its technical feasability is doubtful.Implying you're... Bitcoin does not enforce anything else than tx out collection. For the rest it's auto-adjusting. If that's the only reason then you should make it public anyway, it might always help someone.But I don't really get what all that FGPA thing is all about, AFAIU you don't get much Hashes/$ but you do get lots of Hashes/Watt amirite ? Why not have an even *strongerer* network then.Please, read and think about this thread -> http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=1332.0What are you talking about ? Oh I see ! I remember people complaining about how closed source GPU miners are so unfair to those mining with CPUs.Now everyone mines with a GPU we end up with a much stronger network. Not sure about that, testnet can be reset. how is it vile? it has a question mark at the end... private property is an illusion working on this one  Natural selection is here for a reason. Doesn't affect "legitimacy" at all.The bitcoin calculator doesn't take into account the future difficulty jumps, so you'd generate 2$ the first two weeks and then less every 2016 blocks.1. The figures probably add up, can't be bothered to check 2. No, why would there? You'd like the network to somehow guess that the computational power is "legitimate"?3. Define "viable" I think bitcoin's success also depends a lot on the collapse or partial collapse of the financial system as we know it. Obviously it works with *some* websites, the front page of google obviously won't do...Again, you pick a website for which you don't have to guess.... Again, a famous newspaper will do.If you want to nitpick go for it, the point is there are much easier ways to solve a not-so-common problem (you'd first be worried about the person actually sending the goods wouldn't you). This is why I specifically mentioned a newspaper website, not a physical newspaper.If you can scan a QR code and verify a signature with a smartphone, chances are that you can access any newspaper website. I don't really see how that's more convenient than photographing your baseball card with the nytimes.com in background.Oh wait a minute, the nytimes.com solution doesn't require you to scan any sort of fancy QR code.My point is that your idea doesn't really solve any problem in a much more elegant way than the outlined solution. 2-3 days will be enough if I reuse large chunks of bitcoin-central source code 
One of the best features of Ruby on Rails is Ruby. "woah". Any further questions ? Yea I know, it's for grown-ups  This again is an estimate that is based on data samples (avg. interval between blocks), you might want to wait a little bit for a larger sample to get more accurate projections. Heh, didn't mean to make fun of the OP, I just opened this thread, read the post and was like "holy shit, that's a lot of mining power ki-- oh wait a minute, dammit" Funny how every time there's a diff jump the hashrate calculation approximation has to be re-explained  I'll do much much better.I'll set you up a full fledged web store powered by spree with a bitcoin checkout integration.For free, no catch, PM me for more details. I'll do it for 200.100 if the resulting app is open-sourced. That's ridiculous, there are much better reasons to be ashamed of being french I won't donate coins, but I'll definitely give time to code an open source web interface that manages a backend.I'll also provide a fat server to test it.If you're interested drop me a PM as I don't check the forum every day. LOL IMO lending for interest can work in a sustainable way with a deflationary currency. La fiscalité est identique dans les DOM/TOM  Pas en France, une association peut emettre une facture, un auto-entrepreneur peut émettre une facture, aucun des deux n'est assujeti à TVA (mais ne la récupère pas non plus) I think the main benefit of using a bitcoin bank in the future will be : - Cutting on transaction confirmation time when transfers happen inside the bank - Cutting on transaction fees, still when transfers happen inside the bank This is one of the reasons I like bitcoin  Maybe you should give some precisions about price and shipping  Tu devras probablement déclarer la plus value comme revenu +1 ==> http://acaba.typepad.fr/.a/6a00e54efb082d883301156f407a8f970c-pi

Yup it's still moving, and there's much more to come  Work in progress pour ceux qui sont intéressés : https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-central/wiki/Association Hello all,The bitcoin-central.net website will undergo technical maintenance starting on Friday the 13th of May at 10:00 GMT for approximately 30 minutes.The goal is to deploy some improvements as well as changes in authentication, the details of the changes are available at BC's github repository (https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-central). The main change will be switching from SHA2 in passwords encryption to bcrypt.You will need to confirm your e-mail address, as valid e-mail addresses will now be required (rest assured that you will get e-mailed only in very specific circumstances).As a result of the encryption scheme change it won't be possible to login anymore with your password, so you will have to use the new "Password forgotten" feature after e-mail confirmation (I purposefully never had access to any cleartext password).If your address is not valid and you fail to modify it by then you will still be able to e-mail me to have it changed, on this occasion I might ask you to confirm your password to manually check it against its SHA256 hash before updating your e-mail address.Thank you ! Si tu es assujetti à la TVA tu achètes tout TTC (donc HT + TVA), tu mets le HT dans un compte de charges, la TVA dans un compte TVA à récupérer,quand tu fais une vente tu factures TTC (HT + TVA) tu mets le HT dans un compte de produits et la TVA dans un compte TVA encaisséequand tu payes la TVA à l'état tu fais la différence (TVA encaissée - TVA à récupérer) et tu verses cette différence à l'état, normalement elle est positive si tu vends plus que tu n'achètes et négative dans le cas contraire.dans le cadre d'un site d'échanges la société achèterait du BTC à un particulier en échange d'euros mais devrait facturer de la TVA aux acheteurs de bitcoin, ceux-ci étant des particuliers ils ne pourraient pas la récupérer ce qui équivaudrait à une commission de 19.6% en plus de celle prélevée par le site d'échange !à terme ce qu'il me semble le mieux c'est d'opérer en tant que bureau de change pour que seule la commission facturée par le bureau de change soit soumise à TVA (-> donc 19.6% de 0.2% de la somme échangée par exemple) Une lecture intéressante : http://www.ffme.fr/espace-association/ressource/fiscalite.htm Uniquement sur la plus value ou sur le montant total ?Entièrement d'accord, dans mon idée le bénéfice en euros dégagé servirait à financer les frais de fonctionnement, à promouvoir le bitcoin, et à protéger le bitcoin, ses utilisateurs et les entrpreneurs en clarifiant son cadre juridique et en créant un précédent. (et aussi supporter financièrement le développement de plateformes de trading open source ) Je n'avais pas pensé à ca, c'est intéressant Absolument !Plus j'y réfléchis plus je pense qu'association à but non lucratif c'est le mieux. Je pensais demander à bénéficier du même régime que les travelers cheque. (un moyen d'échanger de la valeur copiable et sécurisé que certains commercants acceptent en paiement)Sinon effectivement c'est la TVA qui flingue tout, on peut s'en débarasser mais du coup le CA est plafonné à 32k...Je me demande s'il existe pas une loi ou un article de loi pour les cas ou un bien/service est acheté TTC à un particulier qui permette de n'appliquer les 19.6% sur la... valeur ajoutée ...Sinon y a aussi l'option asso. 1901 avec salariés et prestataire technique. Bonjour à tous,Je réfléchis aux solutions légales qui s'offrent, en France, à ceux qui voudraient mettre en place un changeur BTC/EUR de manière légale.La piste qui me semble la plus réaliste à l'heure actuelle est celle du bureau de change, le capital minimum pour en ouvrir un est relativement faible, il faut ensuite demander une autorisation à la Banque de France et ensuite c'est parti.Contrairement à l'agrément bancaire, il ne me semble pas que les dirigeants d'une société qui fait du change manuel doivent avoir un quelconque diplôme (pas de casier par contre).Il y a toutefois deux points d'achoppement :  - le capital minimum : 38 000  (faible par rapport aux 5 000 000  minimum pour un agrément bancaire) - la reconaissance du BTC en tant que devisePour avoir une certaine sécurité juridique sur le deuxième point je pense à demander un rescrit fiscal pour l'administration prenne position et confirme que le BTC est changeable comme le sont les travelers cheques (voir réponse de l'IRS qui est passée sur ce forum il me semble), que les changeurs manuels sont habilités à changer.Concernant le premier point je serais intéressé par monter une structure légale avec des associés pouvant apporter du capital et/ou des compétences.Commentaires et candidatures bienvenues ! One block isn't statistically significant, plus I wouldn't see where the interest would be. Wouldn't really make any sense it if was true.If the global hashrate is computed against an average of *past* block intervals and *current* difficulty it can't be accurate right after a difficulty bump.
Care to share the price estimate, maybe the bitcoin economy can not only be fast, but also efficient and competitive  SEPA wires are =~free, it's the currency exchange part that is heavily charged I just put up some install info on the main github project page + wiki, PM me if you need more info. registered will someone hit me with a stick if i ask how to collect the shares ?  What I did : - set up ubuntu desktop - have gnome auto login - have a shell script run in console at startup of gnome - in that shell script have a screen command (or maybe run gnome-terminal remotely and tell it to run screen) - whenever i want to use a miner remotely i logon using ssh, issue a "screen -dRR" - the screen instance i get is "aware" of the x server running and i can launch a miner using itanyway, the goal is to have an user logged in to gnome and a screen instance that is "aware" of it to be able to run mining softwarehope it helps Si une conférence se fait, quel que soit l'endroit ou l'évènement, je veux bien participer en aidant à la préparation, la logistique, et le financement I have a couple of ideas which basically revolve around "we sell you bitcoin central credits for 1 EUR each, you exchange these credits online, and when you're fed up with them we buy them from you at .98 EUR", the main problems with that is : - VAT paid on sales (someone pays 100 EUR + 19.6% French VAT to get 100 EUR worth of credit ? --> Not going to happen) - If you sell 10 kEUR worth of credits you know you'll get 200 EUR profit (assuming a 2% withdrawal fee), but in the accounting books it appears as a net profit (unless you use creative accounting techniques) until you buy the credits back from the users --> 33% profit tax, not going to happen eitherHow are you going to manage the legal side of things, is polish law very different ? Doing very well!I have to say last few IRL months didn't leave me much more internet access (and more generally time) than : "anyone wants to withdraw money? if yes send", "is the bitcoin client dead? if yes restart" and then back to IRL...I now officially have much more time to take care of the bitcoin central business and compete with your new fancy exchange From what I just read you found a legal way to run the exchange acting as an escrow but not have real time trading the mtgox/bc way ? Hey, just saw this thread and registered, the site looks really nice Wish you lots of success!Just a thing, you should put a time scale on the main page graph. Did gavin confirm the date ?I'm fine with anything as long as the date is confirmed so I can take a day off work and the place has beer and space enough for all of us  Just sent you a little something  From my experience you need X to be running. Shipping to europe ? Quartier de la bourse ? I will totally show up Thanks a lot !E-mail sent, sorry about the delay, IRL business will probably calm down now, back to the bitcoin forums, yay! ITT : someone complaining about bitcoin being an anonymous currency XD I'm actually planning on adding whatever people currency want by letting people emit e-currency of their choice and then just acting as the trading platform. LR is usually instant, sometimes, for an unknown reason it can take up to half an hour to clear, from my experienceIt's usually the bitcoin client crashing XD http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEnfy9qfdaU
appears the bitcoin client crashed for some reason so thats why no addresses could be generated, no funds withdrawn and sent funds weren't appearing.can someone confirm LR and Pecunix auto deposit/withdrawal status ? chill down, i'm herehave been pretty busy lately though.no money frozen at all, going to have a look at the withdrawal problems  Heh, I took no time to make an admin interface, my admin interface is mysql prompt or rails console prompt Come on... He'd get them as fast as his client can write blocks to the disk.Difficulty adjustments would be irrelevant, so would network latency be since the network would just slowly catch up after the fact. How about you read the entire fucking thread ?I'm monitoring it  J'essairai d'être la, j'achèterai une visière de comptable pour l'occasion, avec une calculatrice qui imprime aussi, et un crayon sur l'oreille.Très important le crayon sur l'oreille. Really ?   interesting Probably Not very much at all. And it'll probably stay like that unless I find a viable solution to handle incoming/outgoing money other than "balance it between your own personal accounts"   I think these drops are healthy things just correcting a bit  That's pretty clever. What I'm offering to someone interested would be the followign thing : you buy BCEUR in bulk and resell it charging a fee.Why ? Because accepting wires from people eats time, because I'd rather get one or two significant wires than lots of small ones over the same period. Yes sir.david@bankbox:~$ ruby -vruby 1.8.7 (2010-06-23 patchlevel 299) [x86_64-linux]david@bankbox:~$ gem -v1.3.7 nice! +1 Nice. 
Heh yeah, scared people VS people who feel that no matter what happens, bitcoin or one of its clone will free humanity a little more  After reading the posts here, my final opinion is : no rules, no CP, mirrors  you are funny. let go a bit off of things, of the control-freak attitude, you'll feel much better and live a much more peaceful and happy life  I stated clearly that IRC wasn't a replacement for easier communication means.I'm a host, I offered to host a mirror, check the poll.See the mirrors thing.Christianity started by being underground, has been illegal too, did it kill it ? or did it make it stronger ?Check a history book.Check the technical state of Debian against your claim, acknowledge failure See the mirror offer.Check how the "hurr durr terrorists hate my freedom" argument leads to more and more control, more and more regulations, that it is a process that does not stop, and realize how much you can do with your own freedom.I really dislike this "i know what's best for you" kind of attitude, which often goes together with "if you disagree you're short sighted/stupid/childish".You have the option to open your own forum with your very own rules and make it politically correct if you feel it's the right thing to do.And these are not just words, one day I found out that mtgox would start charging trade fees, and now we have an open source exchange. Freedom is what I preach, and it's what I do. market will do its job  Bitcoin is money of the free, let this place be its forum I'm strongly against any rule other than "be respectful to others", and I'm willing to support that by hosting a mirror in case something goes wrong. Firearms are legal in the US, some drugs in the netherlands, prostitution is legal in some countries.Bitcoin is money for the free, the forum just reflects that, the way it's run is not mine to define, but I nonetheless agree with its rules.There is always a starting point to censorship, but there's never an ending point... Why not ban everything remotely controversial ?I'm not saying IRC *replaces* the forum, neither am I stating that simple communication means accessible to most internet users are useless.The forum would just change host.Drugs and fire arms sales can be too. It's all relative.Attention is always in favor of bitcoin.Technical development mostly happens on github and IRC, and that's only counting the main client.To people who are unhappy, uncomfortable with the way this forum is being run, it is your right to feel that way, but you'll always get better results and general satisfaction by using your own freedom to make something that suits you (start a new forum with your rules, emphasize on what *you* feel is important, have links from this forum to yours etc.) instead of asking for other's freedom to be limited. Stuff happens on IRC.This forum is nice to have but definitely not critical. More than enough.Already hosts bitcoin central, some other sites.IIRC it's a Xeon octo-core with 16Gb RAM, 2Tb HDD and 1Gb network connection.I'd do the admin and deployments, you wouldn't get SSH access (a phpMyAdmin on the DB and a JSON-RPC access to the client could be available if needed/requested) Haha yea that's right, the year 2000 bug totally destroyed the internet, so will the ip4 shortage. Sounds like a true coder  Why would one laugh ? Yes it can.Store amounts with more precise representations. I'll make it 100  No worries What license will you want it under ? Regarding the development costs, I will be able to give an estimate if there is a rough spec draft made.Lots of the bitcoin-central.net will be re-used in order to minimize the development time. I think it's the volume since midnight (don't ask me the timezone ) Normally, highest priced buy orders are matched first.Code is at https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-central/blob/master/app/models/trade_order.rb (lines 82 and 137) feel free to have a look. Hmm, don't think so, the book looks consistent to me right now.Would have been buggy if there were outstanding matching orders left. BD intéressante, créer une monnaie locale est une bonne chose qui n'implique pas d'exclure les autres 
Probably not until tx fees become the main generation incentive. Anonymous is mostly people who don't know about IT and won't give a damn if they can't point their LOIC piece of shit at bitcoin Each node mines for a different set of transactions, depending on the topology of the network.I definitely disagree strongly with this point of view. I don't trust government run "stress tests" What's the point of going up to hackers and be like : "ok guys, go for it, attack us, but please think inside the little box we defined for you" Very easy to setup, don't hesitate to ask me the day you feel like installing it. I'm not a big fan of the try-to-break-it-but-be-gentle kind of approach. So you're going to buy/sell with a spread ? I can personnally testify that as an exchange operator it is a fair bit of work to answer e-mails and perform transfers. How do you know the damaged party actually got damaged ?I doubt the scammer will be like "oh yea buddy i totally tried to scam you there !" I sold almost half of my coins two weeks ago for approx. 1.5 kEUR, I'll let you do the math  facebooker gem does that well.I'd rather get money upfront money than promises.That's what the capital is for after all  That's basically an escrow service.You're assuming that the dispute can always be resolved, how are you going to handle that ? I'm applying for the coder position. Do I need to present what I've already developed ? That's like saying you'd rather host PHP websites using WAMP because mod_php needs testing ... Or you can just install mod_passenger for apache to run Rails apps as easily as PHP ones. I'll make a professionnal install and add two currencies of your choice for a modest 100 BTC fee (not counting SCI integration though).Why get a copy when you can get the original ?!  To me that means, "ok guys, I'm broke, obviously no way that I'm going to repay you all, here's my stuff, now let's have a fresh start"Guess it doesn't sound very funny if he owes yo money...Also to me it somehow raises the whole question of lending in a deflationary currency. Just go bankrupt buddy No worries, some people have that tone AND are seriousYou don't need to explain that, your resistance only makes me harder. It is just as easy to transport 2000 bitcoins than 0.00002 bitcoins.When money is immaterial it all boils down to notation conventions. 21 million, purely arbitrary.Also, you don't track units, you track available balances which conceptually allows for indefinite division, there's no such thing as a conceptual atomic bitcoin unit. Otherwise what ?Omg, they're gonna generate so much we're going to get so screwed.Sometimes I don't understand how people can find so many reasons to be scared...If someone fucks bitcoin up then good, means it wasn't strong after all.If someone tries and fails then good ! Means it's strong.Both outcomes are profit.
so, why are you coming back, and edit your posts if you don't care ?  Why would they even care? If there is a vulnerability it won't disappear just by hiding it under the carpet.... And really, really, you can say whatever you want but the images are distorted. Never got 2.2 to work ...  Wtf ?We accept bitcoin...This looks like an ugly copy-paste of some random porn site. Go for it, you can either : - put a bounty up, - do it yourself  They usually have good graphic cards, and it's all that matters. As you know, there is no such thing as transaction for which you are forced to pay a fee.There are, however, transactions that won't get relayed by the standard client due to the fact that they're probable spam.We should just put a setting for the user to decide what the minimum amount a transaction should have in order not to be considered as spam, and included in mined blocks. Well, first of all, they would have to pay loads of money in this scenario.The more they would buy, the more deflation there would be, the higher the price of remaining coins.Unlike physical currencies it's not a problem to divide coins more and more to provide for the exchange needs. Move is probably not the right word, what you mean is covered by the -rescan switch, which will be available from 3.20 Is it possible (not necessarily in the CLI, a function in the code could do too), to rescan against a single key ? Y a un peu de ca oui, ceci dit j'ai pas envie de vendre tout mon stock, et il n'est pas infini  Ca dépendra du cours constaté à ce moment la.J'avoue que je vois plus ca comme une occasion d'échanger, discuter avec les gens, signer les clefs PGP plutôt que de vendre des tonnes de bitcoins, je pense que je vendrai aux alentours de 0.8. J'ai pas d'ordres à placer, je viens avec un gros tas de bitcoins, je m'assois dessus en sirotant un cocktail (avec un petit parasol) et j'attends qu'on vienne m'en acheter, et je discute tranquillement avec les gens qui sont la. Would you download a bear? Hmm, ok.Samedi prochain ? Would you download a car ? Really?Freedom is not given, it's conquered... Faut trouver un endroit avec wifi alors, et le mac do, ca va être pas très sexy...
The method to achieve that is :1. throw away the code that rounds everything at two decimal places2. prevent the main client from *relaying* spam transactionsProblem solved.It was the case on bitcoin central until I noticed that the account functionality of the standard client was broken, when trying to move amounts between accounts, I noticed that the client was happily throwing away the subcent bits, which led to wrong balances. Depends on what you want exactly, with the accounts thing as described originally, it's pretty hard.Just exporting a key, and rescanning upon re-import is not that hard. Mouais, moi pour les ventes je pensais plutôt me ramener les poches vides, collecter du cash et envoyer les bitcoins une fois rentré à la maison. The topic line should be edited and "[SOLVED]" added  It's important that the client handles, sends, and moves (between accounts) amounts at any arbitrary precision.It doesn't harm regular users in any way, and allows for very precise account balances. +1 TrueTrue, however, this just means that the output selection algorithm should be restricted to some outs instead of all available outs when sending coins from an account.So, there *is* such a thing as an account private key, it's just that the client does not take these in account when spending coins from an account. It does. See "getnewaccountaddress". This thread is really interesting... Then, please quit whining, and go make your own, where people be required to behave like respectable grown-ups and content will be MPAA rated.People mostly disagree with you, mod told you to get lost, what are you still doing here ? I do not say that.If what you're saying is that "If the Internet as it is disappears, then bitcoin is doomed" then kudos, you're a genius. You don't point out any facts that would "doom" bitcoin, I don't really see how to explain further.I won't use a data center, so I can still keep using bitcoin.The adoption by Joe whatever is irrelevant to the success of bitcoin.Most people fail to see that bitcoin is already successful, it works, period.Some people trade stuff for them, some people speculate with them, some people save with them.What else do you want ? It will simply grow in scale over time *if* the properties of bitcoin make it possible no matter how controlled chinese citizens are, and no matter how brainwashed some masses can be. Testnet has been reset in the github source tree, in other words, if you compile from source you'll have a testnet with ~1 diff. Should be much easier to test  +1  Maybe you should contact mtgox before spreading FUD like this.It is all documented in the API page, requires a POST (not very clean but well...) to be sent and the path is encrypted.And you seem not to have a clue about them  Thoughts? Not a problem. You don't seem to get that people can be free grown ups and that the world is not going to crumble apart.No, it will simply become a board of 4chan.Except for you're not daddy, now please GTFO and take your FUD and morals with you.I didn't know you owned it.Implying that fucking the government is a bad thing...Bitcoin is the most free currency that has ever circulated, if governments have a problem with freedom it's not bitcoins problem. Just as your little fears are not the mods problem.You obviously fail to understand that legality of bitcoin is irrelevant to its use as a currency.If a government makes bitcoin illegal, it will shed massive light on it, and lead to massive adoption, and in turn expose the contradictions of said interdiction. So. What? Yes it is.However, this kind of URL is easily used in CSRF exploits. Yea, because browsing the bitcoin forum instantly makes you a criminal....
A piece of paper is cheaper than a usb drive ......... +1 Of course it's not, he still does things that require a banking license where I live, safeguarding people's money, allowing people to send money to each other etc.I have no idea about the best possible solution, I think the network of exchangers is a good first step, nefarios idea with the credit cards is really creative but I don't really see it scale well. There are not a lot a "lot of stupid laws" being broken. There's one big fat law probably being broken, that's conducting the business of being a bank without the proper license.That can't exist when one uses bank wires. Money has to get in, money has to get out, dead simple. You can't have something global and scalable using cash.It will hit mtgox eventually, and it will hit hard. And it might probably hit me too eventually if I don't find creative solutions  I'm actually starting to wonder  Il faisait super bon aujourd'hui, je pense qu'on a loupé une occase  It all boils down to MtGox printing the mtusd currency, and backing it with a basket of other currencies, one of them being LR.That's one of the things I disliked in his way of doing things, not saying it's wrong in its essence, just that it has a little fractional reserve smell to me.As far as bitcoin central is concerned, the sum of all LR balances is 100% covered and my balances are public, I've used my real name and address for the account, there's not much more I can do. No Right now there's absolutely none, feel free to edit the github wiki.Questions welcome Grrr. Mistake != Non-american convention Bitcoin Central now features a full fledged API that allows any user action to be fully and securely automated using XML or JSON posted data.Authentication is possible using the user and password passed as parameters or a timestamped token. Here you go https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcointools1Fw6r8ooPKTEPuoKMQhUuFFB1PP43ktLcL This is not 4chan   Comes from a stupid french play on words : "davoûte plantaire".EDIT : Later realized that a big parisian street was named boulevard Davout  Yay!I'll remember to send you a PM next time I intend to break the API (yes, it was entirely my fault  ) That's nice of you!I'll let you know when the string extraction part is done so you just have to translate some strings in a file. Moi je veux bien venir et vendre du BCEUR contre du cash  Your username is there, so you don't need to sign your posts  Sure, but two things, the <blink> tag won't work in most modern browsers, it's definitely not a regexp that'll do the trick. Maybe the best would be to clearly document how to setup a different testnet.I'll document what I did to reset the current test net, let's start from there.
wtf? incredible! I think chmod755 has started something, it would be nice if he could confirm here Yes.From what I understand, there are two different things testnet is used for testing generation -> you need low difficulty in order to make testing easy, testnet also has to have the same rules than main net, otherwise tests can't be very meaningful.If you need some long running tests, you might as well test with a couple of main net coins.I don't mind doing the coding associated with this task once in a while when difficulty makes testing harder.Patch is here Hey! Thanks a lot for the complementary explanations!For this, just add ?locale=XX at the end of any URLOr use git rebase LOLThat would be awesome!I still need to setup the staging enviroment  I'm in!Somebody up to take the business opportunity of selling stamps ?  Hello all!I'm putting a 100 BTC bounty for some translation and localization work.What does it involve ? - installing rails on your machine, - check that the bitcoin central code works correctly, - extract all strings into an english yaml dictionary, - translate it into a language of your liking (i'd prefer russian, german, or chinese but the main goal is to make it easily translatable)Do I need to know Ruby/Rails ? - No, however, without knowledge of HTML it'll be hard for you How much work does that represent ? - Probably 3 to 4 hours work.Since code is usually better than explanations I've commited an example which shows how it basically goes. From all of what I just read, the reason why it was forbidden was because of the riots that would have ensued from distributing cash in the street, *not* because writing something on currency is illegal. The point of testnet is to make tests that are significant and reproductible on main net, if the two have different rules you might as well not test anythinggood question Don't remember that. I'd love to read about it I'm not even sure it's illegal. +1 or just a simple "this is not money, visit bitcoin.org" Would sound nigerian to me. Still running? i get a problem communicating with bitcoin RPCJust changed the address, port, user and pass from the script I use to pool with slush Not that I know of.Answer I found is unelegant polling.Also iirc there was a consensus on the fact there had to be a point at which you decide that the transaction won't be reversed and consider the payment as valid.Something I should implement in BC is check that confirmations keep going up for every transaction. If the number of confirmations for a given tx stops going up even though the block count increased means that the transaction got invalidated and should be taken care of specifically.* davout opens a git issue  Because I don't want to sign a transaction with five PGP keys, a fingerprint and a sample of my DNA each time i want to buy some coffee. I bought some here a little while ago -> http://www.tamponsgautier.com/ I'll probably answer this evening when I get a hold of a computer that knows my PGP keys Also sorry for all the people that sent e-mails that I haven't answered to, not ignoring anyone, just been really busy with hardening the code, integration of pecunix and real life  What language/framework are you going to develop your app with ?Also, be aware that accounts tracking is unreliable as of now since it will silently discard subcent amounts, that happened on bitcoin central, people had a reported balance that was different when asking to the DB and to the client.The bitcoin central code is open sourced, you can study it to see how it's managed. Or just spend them where people won't care.Deposit them at the bank, if the numbers are visible they won't say anything.
Plus it'd be totally worth it.You get fined for stamping bills on bitcoins ? It will be free advertising, you'll probably make the amount of the fine with the mere increase of value of your BTCs  Ca pourrait être intéressant, plutôt sur quel thème? Ca reste à prouver  Personnellement je suis un habitué de linuxfr et j'ai trouvé l'article de grondilu Might still be a good idea since it isn't possible to prove that you're the one that stamped them Let's make it a policy to reset testnet every month/release/whatever.Problem solved, same rules for both, difficulty will stay really low since no one will want to mine for TBTC since it will be clear they will never be valuable. that sounds like a pretty good idea actually! There is no such thing as intrinsic value It depends on their intrinsic qualities I guess, a plain straight fork of bitcoin made by Google would have the huge advantage of google's advertisement power.It all boils down to the market, and what it wants... Depends on what uncle Sam asks google to do Assuming Bob places his ask before Carl the following would happen on BC.Alice buys 10 from Bob @0.9 for a total of 9. Alice has an outstanding bid of 10 @ 1.1, bob's order disappears from the system.Alice buys the remaining 10 from Carl when he places his order @ 0.95 for a total of 9.5, alice's order disappears, Carl is left with an outstanding ask of 10 @ .95.If Bob and Carl place their asks before Alice, then when Alice comes along the order is matched against the bids with the lowest price first. You get to decide how trades get executed, is it at buyers price? sellers price? median price?Choice is yours.Bitcoin central and mtgox work in the same way : the one who sells bitcoins is guaranteed to get the price he asked for when placing the order, the one who buys them is guaranteed that he'll buy from offers with a lower or equal price than the price he input when posting his buying order. Yea, just do it in a smooth way and tickle curiosity rather than have people think how it's a scam/ponzi scheme/etc.   You should edit your post and add a link to some of the simple explanations of what bitcoin is EDIT: and also give a sample of exchange price to USD, so people clearly understand they'll be able to cash them out PM sent You can submit a patch if you'd like If it was as simple as that I would've done it already, the hard part is not to replace the hash function, the hard part is update the passwords that are recorded in the database if you see what I mean  Better, tell him to switch to an open source backend, so everyone will be able to inspect his source  you can also : - put a bounty for specific functionality, - fork the BC code, i'd help you out on implementing that if you want There's lots of things I'd like to do on BC, this sounds a little out of the scope I imagine for BC though. That sounds like an interesting idea done!See herejgarzik, you should confirm your BC account number so I can credit you the gold I used for testing.
Bitcoin-Central.net now supports Pecunix gold trading.Users can add Pecunix gold grams to their accounts, from there they can trade them for free for BTC, and send them for free to other BC accounts (sending to e-mail addresses in progress  ).And of course, it's completely open source.Withdrawing gold will be manual unless I manage to get Pecunix to activate the API for Bitcoin Central.Thanks a lot to jgarzik for his bounty (original thread) and the 2 grams I borrowed from him for testing purposes! Tonal system sounds pretty complicated...Is it a base 16 system ?How do you count to 10 or 100 (decimal) with it ?  There is no such thing as a fee-requiring-tx, the default miner won't mine for some transactions, but the warning message should not imply that it is the protocol that prevents very small free transactions but merely the default implementation of the miner. I'm not sure I get people's points right, my opinion, summed up is : - GUI and JSON should allow every operation with full precision, - It's the responsibility of the miners/clients to decide which transactions they want to include/relay - No transaction fee should be auto-set, but not relaying free subcent transactions seems like a reasonable default I think that resetting testnet once in a while is a good thing, it will mean resetting the difficulty too, so specific difficulty rules for testnet are not only useless but adding complexity and prone to introducing bugs (this for example) Well, I think it's kind of weird to have different rules for testnet than main net...Usually, a staging environment is kept as close as possible to the production one.Resetting it is not a bad thing per se, having different rules for each net is definitely not a good thing IMO. What if tomorrow we decide that testnet should have extra X, Y and Z features because it's more "convenient" ?Maybe the lessons learned with the overtaking of test net should be applied to main net too, if one individual took test net over, what can an organization do ? And how can we anticipate that ? What I vote for is the following : - reset testnet with the same rules than main net, - commit to the fact that the only difference between main and test are the port and the genesis block, - anticipate a way to deal with main net being overtaken by someone who decided it was worth doing itA simple solution I can think of : - If no block has been generated for 24h,, 48h or whatever divide difficulty by 2I don't think that : - accepting that main and test have different rules, - not anticipating this particular kind of attackis a good thing. You can't be serious... Yes, this is not supposed to happen, it should be completely transactional. Usually, when you create an order, it is executed and trades are created if matches are found, the order amount is updated accordingly, and it is saved for later execution. What do you mean ?I still have a little regression on some trade orders execution, should be fixed tonight.Yes, that would be nice Yes, that is normal.If you post a buy order, the matching orders are : - sell orders, - with a =< price - with a different user id than yours - orders for which the seller has sufficient BTC balanceThe trade happens at sellers price.Think of the price you're inputting for a buy order as the maximum price you're willing to pay for a single BTC. Thank you !You need to input my BC account number (BC-U313785) to transfer LRUSD to me.Bitcoin addresses only work for bitcoin transfers, it will remain internal (not go through a bitcoin transaction) if the address is owned by a BC user. Just came back from my week-end, also I've been able to reproduce the bug.Seems linked to bitcoin accounts functionality. Yea, that's nice, but will we reset the main network the day someone pulls the same trick on it ? Captcha problems are now fixed.A more general update can be found here http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2519.60 Bugs have been fixed.Adding LR and withdrawing it, as well as BTC handling should work fine in full automatic mode.You are now able to transfer money to other BC users using their account numbers (sending funds to an e-mail address does not work yet though).All balances should be OK.If you ever encounter a problem, or notice that your balance is not what you expect please e-mail the support@bitcoin-central.net address, use it instead of PMs.Sorry for the inconvenience and happy trading. Hey all,well the balance update should only be manual for wired Euros, Liberty Reserve handling should be 100% automatic.I think I've introduced a couple of bugs when deploying the last version, I'm going to fix them this morning and will update everyone here in a little bit.  Ok, so that just means PGAU withdrawals will be manual Do you mean that they don't have an SCI ? what? A challenger appears.To what precision are gg usually traded ? No, not yet, that's planned, but what you get for now is the ability to transfer funds other users.Like, you can make an OTC deal and exchange LREUR for LRUSD for example.If I give you my account number you can give me money for free 
Yay!Bitcoin Central now allows its users to transfer any currency directly to another BC account.This will allow buying and selling BC EUR credit in an OTC fashion. Shipping to France ? I'm glad someone uses it, do whatever you want with it, and re-license it the way you like  Doesn't work like this, you have to know the transactions you're processing *before* hashing.You can't find a winning hash, wait for a tx fee and then release, including th tx in our block will invalidate the merkle root and therefore the whole block.Are you sure ?Adding a transaction is extremely cheap. This just blew my mind.  Haven't gotten anything so far  I think what would be perfect is a way to add that functionality into the main client, with the possibility to register public keys as people you trust for alerts.I was actually thinking of coding a big red "Panic!" button into the bitcoin-central.net code so it could be shut down from a distance by me sending a text message, or a set of trusted users. Yea, actually he did speak about it, guess I should read better  Maybe there should be some norm that the closing price is at 00:00 GMT. Would you open source it for a 400 BTC bounty ? The OP did not mention generating at all But as others explained there are lots of options to make payments expressed in BTC.If you're a merchant mtgox or mybitcoin (and very very soon bitcoin-central) will provide for a merchant shopping cart interface.If you're a shopper any of those will do if you don't really feel like running the client. Nobody "owns" them, the keypair is in your keystore or it isn't.As for the User ID you should stick with something unique, account number, random hash, whatever and use the key for authentication (but not for identification). Because ideas matter  I have a 700~750W PSU for a single 5970.According to ArtForz, I could put a couple on a 1KW PSU I don't really see how you'd get a positive ROI if you factor in the previous assertion "the price would plummet"  You could progressively make that content exclusive  Yeah, for some success on digg i think the article should look something like : "10 reasons your banker won't like bitcoin", "5 reasons why ron paul would totally support bitcoin" Psychological barriers can be strong too i guess Also make sure *not* to use ATI stream SDK 2.2
I disabled crossfire on my 5970 with aticonfig.david@xxxxx:~$ env DISPLAY=:0.0 aticonfig --lscs    Candidate Combination:     Master: 0:0:0     Slave: 0:0:0     CrossFire is disabled on current device    CrossFire Diagnostics:    CrossFire can work with P2P mapping through GART    Candidate Combination:     Master: 0:0:0     Slave: 0:0:0     CrossFire is disabled on current device    CrossFire Diagnostics:    CrossFire can work with P2P mapping through GARTalso, just in case,david@xxxxx:~$ env DISPLAY=:0.0 aticonfig --help | grep crossfire  --lscc, --list-crossfire-candidates  --lscs, --list-crossfire-status  --lsch, --list-crossfire-chains  --cfa, --add-crossfire-chain  --cfd, --delete-crossfire-chain  --cf, --crossfire={on|off}  --cfl, --crossfire-logo={on|off} I almost got a heart attack when it first happened ot me xD Downloaded the paper, it's nice!Maybe there could be some kind of market analysis included too ? upped You need to disable xfire using aticonfig, don't remember exactly how to, but aticonfig can do it Head to #bitcoin-dev for more info.Also you need ATI stream SDK 2.1, and *not* 2.2 Dugg! There's a -rescan switch in the works  That wouldn't change anything. This is really nice and clearly summed up Our energy might be abundant, but it's definitely not that cheap.0.11 EUR/kwh.

Deciding whether to run untrusted code is your responsibility, the mere fact a project is open source doesn't mean someone can compile and distribute a rogue binary to people who won't bother to compile themselves.Is your online banking interface under AGPL ?No. Doesn't mean it can deal with money, you use it because you trust it to work as advertised.Nothing wrong with having a different opinion, however there's no technical reason why the source should be under GPL rather than MIT.It doesn't really make a difference. What matters is the protocol, not the mainstream client. So everyone who'd like to join the discussion and debate on your paper has to pay 1 BTC ?Meh. Yea... I've been generating json by hand which was probably a bad idea, guess I should fall back to the nice Hash#to_json method Also I'd need a DTD to validate my XML against, I guess the whole API is going to need some attention. I was only half-joking about the JS miner,even though the hash speed would be pretty laughable the numbers could make up for it,Could be a nice way to monetize popular content. Put a javascript miner on the faucet page  Inverse les rôles de la nana et du mec, ca fera un peu genre Cerise de groupama t'explique la vie  Yes.But beware, if you backup at block 120,000 and you move the wallet to another client that has block 120,000 it won't pick up your balance right away.You'll need to remove the block chain data in order to force a re-download of all blocks in order to force the client to scan them against the wallet that has just been put in place. énorme.je pense que ce serait cool si c'était les rôles de l'homme et de la femme étaient inversés.aussi une adresse correspond à une clef publique, pas privée. Done  For those who didn't know it yet we accept bitcoins for trading against EUR, LREUR and LRUSD at bitcoin-central.net.Maybe it could get listed on http://bitcoin.org/trade meh I think crema has a problem with his browser because he gets warnings visiting https://bitcoin-central.net/ even though my certificate is properly signed by my certification authority. I think you have a problem with your browser. Well, that information is kind of outdated, since it was written it became much harder to generate coins.If you're really serious about mining come hang out on #bitcoin-dev for help  It's not like there's bug-free accounts functionality available in stock client   Do like me, start with labels =)https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32That's really all I feel comfortable with (well actually not, I was wondering whether I should update locale files...) Me = big key pool + hourly cron job + PGP + e-mail to gmail boom Well, but if you account for the shares you get just before a block is found it statistically evens out.That's true mining solo, coop mining you get paid proportionally to your shares.[/quote]Share = easy block, it is the exact same This has been discussed in depth in many threads. Go read, lurk a bit, educate yourself before expecting people to "address your assertions".Not gonna lose any more time with you kthxbye No. Why would it need to ever get online  ?Theoretically you don't even need the client, you can just create keypairs, hash the public key, boom, you have an ultra-secure address that never touched the internet.
I think the safest option is a bank that stores bitcoins on addresses that are part of an offline-wallet, transfers would have to be done manually, but IMHO you can't beat that. Wow gene, I really missed you!You successfully demonstrated that "bank notes" != "bitcoin", I'm impressed. There's no such thing as a partially completed share... If you're mining at 10 khash/s you're basically playing lottery 10,000 times per second.  / 0 That's pretty stupid... The funds circulating on the actual network *are* the implicit bounty for cracking it... J'accueillerais bien volontiers un blog en francais/anglais sur bitcoin-central.netA bon entendeur... You can add EUR to your account by : - wiring them to me (cheap/free in SEPA zone), - meeting me in person in Paris, - sending cash in the mailYou can add BTC by simply sending them to any of your bitcoin-central addresses, and withdraw them to any address of your choice.For EUR withdrawal I can wire/mail/give them to you.Contact the support@bitcoin-central.net address for inquiries/details, please use PGP encryption for funding related concerns.  And maybe other services we didn't think of yet  Il est aussi possible d'en acheter/vendre sur bitcoin-central.net et mtgox.com, les deux acceptent les virements bancaires en euros.Grondilu, j'aime bien ton script, il fait le boulot sans fioritures mais je suis incapable de le comprendre  Nice !Didn't listen to the show, just hope he didn't mention "world renowned cryptographers"  My goal would be to eliminate the need for trust, that what I'm aiming for Hehe, it isn't really *my* baby anymore now Yeah, I'll educate myself some more about Ripple before actually coding anything I don't think it would be such a big problem, because : - There probably won't be that much hubs, - A scheme could be designed where deposits don't have to be given to each connected hub, A pays to B, but B hasn't a deposit for A, but C has a deposit for A that it acknowledge it will give to B would A fail to finalize the transfer (didn't think this one through but could be something like that) - Deposits would be required only to chop off the statistical variance of inter-hub debt (assuming accounts and transfers are ditributed evenly accross most hubs) - Amounts could get smaller and get adjusted with average transfer sizesSo yes, I think there's more thinking to be done to come up with an elegant and rock solid scheme but I think this could be a good way.Yea, but account hubs can vanish and pop back up in no time, I think the trust-and-debt path is a dangerous one, and I'd rather avoid it.  Bitcoin Central now completely switched to jQuery and jqPlot instead Prototype and Protocharts.Charting code a little cleaned up, still some work to do, but tweaking should be much easier now. bitcoin getnewaddress Maybe, I know my code well, so I'll start from there Natural selection will do the restI think (but I can be completely wrong here since I'm too lazy to go find out) that ripple is based on debt, I'd like a system where there's no inter-hub debt involved.I thought about the "@hub.tld" part too, it could be a nice optional convenience to help the payee's hub with the task of finding the payers hub. His statement doesn't contradict it, just misses the "SEPA" between "domestic" and "transfers".A eurozone transfer is not necessarily SEPA, I would assume SEPA transfers to be much cheaper. Yes my friend, you're missing the distinction between - Necessary, and - Nice to have The rest of your discussion sounds pretty complicated for a pretty much basic flow :1. Identify which hub the X account belongs to2. post a request for payment or invoice to the paying hub3. redirect and have the user confirm4. paying hub sends payment through the network (no need to send transaction data back since propagation is almost instant on the bitcoin network anyway, and could even be really instant by forcing hubs to interconnect directly)5. payment is backed by paying hub deposit on payee's hub until the transaction is confirmed enough, deposits won't be required if some level of trust exists, otherwise they allow zero-trust policyYou don't need complicated things like identity federation or things like that, it all simply boils down to "i'm hub A, i need to map this account number to another hub so i can send it an invoice, do i know the mapping from my own database? yes? fine, confirmation, invoice. I don't? fine i broadcast the request to other hubs, they'll know for sure"This is all a pretty simple extension of an SCI, which is btw on top of my list now  He'll remain alive in my wallet Eww, centralization.I have better, let us, for the sake of the argument, assume that the bitcoin central code knows how to connect to other instances of the bitcoin central code (which i should probably rename to bitcoin-platform, anyway)It becomes pretty easy to clear payments between two of these entities based on : - trust, or - Instance A maintaining a security deposit at instance B, sending a payment from A to B implying taking first from the security deposit, then wait for the transaction to get properly cleared to get the deposit back to its original status.I'll be working on something like that 
Yup Well, what I'm saying is that if the bitcoin client is freely accessible from a script on my page, I can poke admin/password at every single visitor that passes and manage to rob 2% of them. Here we go, for those who would like to localize the code for their particular language I've commited an example at https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-central/commit/e135135f3f7a1062104b7e59ae36701a94559123In this example I've localized a template into french, so you can see that it basically involved removing strings from the template and putting them into a translations dictionary.I've also added some locale switching code, so if you want to change locale at run-time, instead of modifying the core config file you can just pass a ?locale=pl GET parameter in the request and your session will start using the locale you passed.If you want to translate large chunks of text dictionaries are cumbersome, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#localized-views to see how Rails elegantly manages this one too.As a final word, would you want to start translating into a language that doesn't yet have a locale file in config/locales you'll want to get the base translations from here https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n and add them into config/locales before starting the actual extraction/translation work.Have fun and request pulls (on the integration branch)  Thank you!But that's like 83.3 seconds worth of mining on a HD5970 It also needs more cowbell What are you talking about exactly?You just need to issue the "bundle" command for it to automatically fetch/install everything that's needed, you might need to install the bundler gem first but that's all. I wouldn't recommend that. payment did not work... Yay, I see it in gray in my account Ok, so if you want to localize the code, Rails makes it pretty easy, also it would really be an incredibly useful thing to do to pull out hardcoded strings and put them in localized files.The locale files reside in :config/locales/*.ymlhttp://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html this is a must read if you want to start localizing it properly I suggest, that if you want to see a quick result you fork the projet, create a polish locale and start easy by translating the model attributes names I would be really more than happy to answer your questions about the code or rails in general, even if you don't have any previous experience with itFeel free to ask, open issues on the tracker, experiment send pull requests  I like jokes, it's a nice!  What are you implying? And you pledged 250 BTC  Simply telling rails it should accept xml/json input too, and *boom* API APIs pretty much come for free with rails and it's delicious restful way of doing things, throw in a hashed token based authentication and machines will speak to it as easily as humansHmm... Let's play a little game, start documenting your API and see who implements it first Haha yea I'll pass on the american coffee :p Instead of opening the source up on Feb 1 as promised I'll open it up right now,grew bored of coding by myself and wanted to gather comments and pull requests too Have fun!https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-central 1. is not set in stone2. so is cooperation3. this is not specific to any implementation4. can't argue with this one i guess... Well, just implement a trusted bitcoin central instances list in the BC source and you're good to go Nice! Why redevelop a bitcoin handling platform from scratch ?Why not re-use the bitcoin-central source code and simply tweak a couple of things to suit the AH spec ?If you want to do that you'll have a couple more skilled coding hands.Just saying ... j'achète 11 napoléons pour 9,125.00 BTC 
YesI see it merely as a convenience for people who think it does matter, placing a dark pool order is much easier than writing a trading bot that will progressively place bids/asks until their need has been satisfied. http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?search=support%40bitcoin-central.net&op=indexhttp://xkcd.com/364/ Please e-mail support@bitcoin-central.net for inquiries.Bonus points for PGP encryption. Bonjour et bienvenue à toi   If no why ? Because fiat currency, gold and silver coins do the job much better if all you want is have a beer  Bitcoin behaves like cash in the digital sphere, not in the physical world.Trying to have bitcoin behave like physical cash is like trying to stuff a $10 bill in an e-mail. Good luck with that. Is this going to be enabled by default ? Yup, that's right.Minimal size is 3k BTC for a dark pool order Just as you can accept the promise of that person to send you the 50 BTC when he gets a hold of his computer. That could work, you'd just need some problem that's massively parralelizable. I'm discussing the practical side, I don't care about morality.I would make money from money of I could, but I wonder if such a system would be sustainable in the very long run.Yup, makes sense Not really, my point was basically that by repeating the action an infinite amount of times you end up with all the money owned by the bank.Yes, that makes sense, guess the thought experiment is valid only with a single bank. The corners of the sphere ? XD Only part of it, the rest being invested either as capital or lent for... interest  Could you elaborate on the "interest rate decreases" part ? I tend to think that interest rates with a fixed will eventually lead to all the money being held by the bank, assuming it's profitable.Ok look at it this way : - 21 billion BTC circulating, - Bank makes a 100k BTC loan, - Bank eventually gets 105k BTC back, - Bank pays its expenses, it's left with 102k BTC ,[...] - Repeat ten times, bank took 20k BTC out of circulation.Lending with interest works, it doesn't really seem that sustainable to me on the long term, I guess it'll probably all boil down to "hey, let's try and see what happens!" Arrangements are always possible, not for free though  Maybe this could be somehow modular, I assume that the people who will find the most use to this kind of feature are running the client on a server anyway, I'd also assume a Unix flavor in most cases.Maybe a windows client should include the GUI + whats necessary to run an external miner but not the advanced features such as this one. None. At all.
Being afraid of sending cash in the mail is understandable if you've never done it.Personnally I was pretty skeptical about until I received some bitcoin-central.net account fundings  Hah, that would be a fun bounty!I pledge free translation services! yup Brb, inventing hypercube scam scheme +1 Yep, until someone by an incredible chance hit generates the very same address. That's really cool bruce!Why don't we have an european bruce wagner?? Lol, I was like wtf too  Just buy before asians get in  It's going to be pretty nice and strengthening to have all debian geeks putting their sleepy boxes to mine  Yea, I will definitely improve the user profile thing, however I need to code something up quickly for a nice admin interface.Shouldn't be long just have to do it. Ummm yea... That makes good sense, but I feel like it would get hard to compare against other markets.Maybe I can just have both !  Oh god, what have I done There's a reason why sales and engineering are two different jobs. I'm an engineer I think the open sourcing of my code is the best I can do to grow the pie.Also yay!First trades in cash EUR after some people sent cash in the mail/wires!Also S3052, I think I might get loads more volume if I set up dark pools, which are basically in my understanding trade orders that don't get publised anywhere.Oh yes, API has been updated to take EUR currency into account. Maybe the problem won't really be the "how to set it up" but more "how to get enough BTC to satisfy the demand" if it is successful. Cash in the mail I got rid dof the "invalid or stale" messages by slightly downclocking my GPUs. Submitting a block you've generated would be pointless, they'd credit the coins to you since they wouldn't have the private key to your address A test suite would be pretty useless because you'd pretty much be testing either : - the bitcoin client (and that would tie you to a version to some extent) - one of the http, addressable and json libs which would be pretty useless too...Anyway, that's what's being used in production in bitcoin-central.net, flawless so far.I have some tests for the address validation but these are pretty obsolete, they were made when I checked for address validity myself and didn't rely on the client to do it, guess I should remove them  What I do is the following thing :grep debug.log for the "generated" string from time to timeIf some positive result comes out then i grep for "hash:" and check the hash against BBE, if it finds a block in BBE using my hash it means it made it into the blockchain, at that point I usually pet my cat with a satisfied smile on my face.
Check your hash on bitcoin block explorer, and check whether 120 blocks have passed.Generations have to mature 120 blocks before being available in the client, check the FAQ for more info. No, unless you're on a system that uses some sort of accounts and pools deposits. Oui tu peux, de la à en raccorder plusieurs je ne sais pas si c'est une bonne idée.Les miners appellent getwork sur le client qui leur retourne du travail à hasher s'il retourne le même travail pour plusieurs miners différents ce sera du gaspillage.Si le travail renvoyé est différent ca ne pose pas de pb.Mais sinon au pire t'installes le client sur chacun des PC connectés, parce qu'à moins de miner sur des gros GPU tu vas perdre ton temps à mettre tout ca en place.Il y a principalement deux threads sur ce forum qui sont orientés pooled mining, peut-être qu'un des deux est open source. I'm located in Paris, with a couple of newspaper sheets mail is fine, browse a bit the forums you'll see that it's pretty common Well, if you have a french/european bank account it's probably the safest option, send an e-mail to support@bitcoin-central.net if you want to do that.You'll have to go on #bitcoin-otc on IRC, these are the over the counter trades, people might take it.Liberty Reserve is like PayPal except it can't be reversed, no chargebacks = safe bitcoin trades for the seller. Are you french ?You can send some cash in the mail or bank transfer to bitcoin central and buy some bitcoins with these funds. You can mail cash if you have euros though  Yay!First chart is up!Help me make it less ugly! Trade some more  Also seehttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=578157 Sent  Assuming I base the EUR prices on USD conversion which is not the case, EUR prices are fixed by the market, there is no EUR -> USD conversion whatsoever.The price is for one BTC, not for the complete amount, 500 BTC would then sell at 112.50 EUR @ .225 EUR/BTC And maybe other bitcoin exchanges for the matter  For example the ones that allow you to trade LRUSD/LREUR/EUR/BTC for free   Oh forgive me, I could really not help it XD Hey all,Would someone volunteer to make some intro text and/or a mockup of what should go on the welcome page of bitcoin-central ?First it was a "Forbidden" page... Crappy.Next it was the FAQ... Which was even crappier.Now it's the first question of the FAQ shamelessly copy-pasted from the very bitcoin.org website.Any ideas welcome. From the first post of this thread :It's already on github If you want to contribute patches or look at the source send an email at support@bitcoin-central.net and I'll give you a tarball. (my plan is out of private collaborators) Googled it.I shall bake this for 250 BTC.It will feature delicious vanilla from madagascar.An extra 20 BTC for home-made whipped cream.The cake is to be ordered a day in advance and will be delivered any place downtown Paris or close western suburb. Guess I should look a little more into low-res issues Howso? Move to first post, read first post.Done.Should be better now. Looks even better now! http://pizza4btc.com/Damn, it looks in construction, there is a record of a previous Pizza/BTC trade. Wish granted 
New order book is here, comments welcome.Also the API changes a little bit, pass a "separated=1" GET parameter in URLs if you don't want orders with similar price to get aggregated together. I also added some fields in the API output. If you're interested in trading LRUSD for BTC you might have a look at http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2519.0 Your positive comments can count as donations.You can, I just have to code it up.Thanks, I'll use it as a useful example ! Well, then the bitcoin client might have to mirror all the functionality that's available when doing SQL queries against a full fledged RDBMS.I don't really see how, if you're talking about scalability issues that would get solved by nice bitcoin callbacks.Okay, so here's how bitcoin central handles it.It polls the client at regular intervals and does exactly what lucky said, it INSERTs unknown transactions, and updates the confirmations of the known ones (and no, the tx_id is not defined as unique  )It polls the client for each account, not for a global listtransactions (which doesn't really seem to work anyway AFAIK).Yes, this approach is sub-optimal, but IMO it's the only one that allows enough flexibility in the ways you want to deal with the data.I'm completely conscious of the limitations and possible security flaws of this approach, and that's why the bitcoin central code *also* takes advantage of the accounts functionality, providing a second security layer.That, IMHO is the best possible approach for a web app. I'm a total noob at bash scripting, it looks like a very manly way to code xD You just became my new god. Just wait a week or two, you'll see it on BC, with the option to auto forward funds, or auto sell them /w a market order or a minimum price.  Sorry, you'll have to have a soul to be able to connect on bitcoin central XD I guess I'll have to implement penile biometric identification on bitcoin central with a modified fleshlight. I've decided to fully opensource the code behind Bitcoin Central.Someone (he'll make his name public if he wishes) specifically requested it and donated a respectable amount of bitcoins to make it happen.The source has already been released to this person and will be publicly released under the AGPL Free Software Foundation license on February 1st.If you are a Rails developer and you want to study/improve the code behind Bitcoin Central feel free to send me a PM or an e-mail at support@bitcoin-central.net in order to get early access to the source tree.Hopefully, this move will help build a better platform for everyone to use in setting up local/global exchanges, and in the long run, improve the bitcoin economy and awareness as a whole.Hopefully it will also bring a much tougher competition to the bitcoin trading/exchange market It will also enable Rails developers like me to collect bounties on specific feature requests.I have to say I'm really really proud of the work I did and I hope others will find it useful and contribute to it ! As a result of people requesting to fund their accounts by sending EUR in the mail, bank wire,  WU, and the insane difficulty/fees to get a hold of LREUR I've decided to add support for EUR currency and start accepting these funding methods.If you want to trade your BTC for EUR send an e-mail to support@bitcoin-central.net for more information.Currently, no fees will be charged other than the fees charged by the bank for sending money to me.Once your account is funded you will be able to trade for free and get EUR wired back to you free of Bitcoin Central charges. Modern web based keyboards probably base the positioning of digits on some random seed and only POST the positions of the pressed buttons along with the random seed.I'd like one of those  It's nice but you're doing it wrong.Looked at your code, here are two comments : - You're relying on executable calls, you should send HTTP requests instead - Instead of duplicating every possible method call in your code you should simply rely on method_missingSee http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2435.0 for my approach Fixed and deployed. We need to make a nanoCoin wiki page... Nice! I can reproduce what is happening.I manually activated your order, manually checked your balance, manually triggered execution, the matching order got inactivated when it shouldn't have been, the same probably happened to your order.Thank you very much for reporting! I'm going to have a look and keep you updated very soon. My troll attempt failed I guess. Is hoarding wrong in its essence ?
Ticker data is now available at :  - https://bitcoin-central.net/trades/ticker.xml - https://bitcoin-central.net/trades/ticker.json I manually re-activated your order. Don't know why it was still inactive.Probably just forgot to manually update your data after deploying the code fixes.I agree on better separation of currencies, I got confused myself. I can think of the following options : - Replace LRXXX by LR$ and LR - Color code - Tabbed order bookI like the first two, what do you think ? I'd like to collect the bounty with the open sourcing of bitcoin-central.net Awesome!Ticker API and charts are the next high-priority features on my TODO.Should be done by the end of the week-end if I manage to find a couple of hours when I'm sober  Trade data is now available in JSON and XML at : - https://bitcoin-central.net/trades/all_trades.xml - https://bitcoin-central.net/trades/all_trades.jsonIt sports the same format as http://mtgox.com/code/data/getTrades.php, it just includes an extra currency field.All timestamps are UTC.Please PM me with an IP as I will eventually restrict the access. Fixes have been deployed.You can now trust the order book. You're not getting 404's at the given URL's, you're getting 302's (forbidden)The 404 you see in the message means that your webserver can't find an error page, like - failed to access the page - try to find an error page to render - oops, not even an error pageDouble check the file system permissions of the directories you're trying to access. You're doing it wrong Divide your balance by zero. Pooling hard and soft cash together is an interesting approach... You ask the same question 3 months ago. That's because they're not removed upon completion.Also you might wonder why some orders that could be matched still appear in the order book, that's just because one of the parties doesn't have the required balance to complete the trade.So the trading works fine, it's just the order book that needs to get some attention.Fixes are almost ready, they should get deployed tomorrow around noon UTC.A couple of charts and all the interfaces will follow promptly. check the webserver logs to see which file it's trying to serve unsuccessfully Right now I haven't really thought about all that.But maybe you can give some advice about how it should go ?Please bear with me while I'm hard at work polishing rough edges, crossing some t's and ensuring that everything is rock solid  Gold will be backed by bitcoins someday. кирпичи нагадил? Keeping things in RAM doesn't make anything safer, at all, understood that the day i downloaded my first Diablo trainer. +1, also there already was apache 1 that they got lots of experience from.+1 on coding first, actually, +1 on "start coding failing tests first" I don't mind opening some parts up.I basically have a wrapper for the client that's based on method missing and making use of a nice yml file for credentials, ports etc.Code:b = Bitcoin::Client.newb.get_balance user.id.to_sIs an example use case.Then I have a whenever schedule that feeds the transactions into my DB, updating confirmations every couple of minutes.Nothing very complicated, i'll share it if you find some use to it, but right now all my time goes to smoothing trading out  In my private repos Idk, never really thought about it but it represents quite some man hoursMy pleasure, I hadn't found such an exciting rails project since a long time, also all the cool kids have opened their BTC service 
I see, I'll start adding more of these once I've ironed the first quirks out, I love Ruby on Rails and it's "if your test suite is strong, go nuts with refactoring" Sure, just give me a couple examples so I can just mirror some API you're already being fed.I'll look into that, it has its official github issue Yea, I'm thinking that it could be really nice It might become very easy when the bounty for an open source trading platform raises a respectable amount  http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2519.0  That is because the seller/buyer doesn't have enough balance to complete the trade, this is an issue, I will fix it promptly I raised the bar a little to 3 confirmations which was the original setting, do you like the "your funds are here, just wait for it a little more" instead of "F5, not yet, F5, not yet, F5, phew, finally". You can hover over the amount in the account history to see how much more confirmations are required.Fixed, thanks for bringing that to my attention Thank you very much!Fixed, it now gently redirectsIs there really that much demand for it ?See previous answer, I'm going to fix this ASAP, it is confusing indeed, I'll inactivate orders when they fail to complete due to lack of funds and try to reactivate them after each successful incoming transfer.You got the "server error, something went wrong, i'll eat your family" page ?I'll check the logs and try to reproduce, thanks for pointing it out.Yea, I know I want to start supportign LiqPay, that would also allow total noobs to buy with a plain old CC. But I'm afraid that would be against their ToS and that I'd end up gang raped by angry users if my account gets frozen. I'll see when I've ironed the rest out.Maybe they got caught for not complying with banking regulations or sthg? I guess it wouldn't be too risky if I always maintain a <2~3k balance on the bank account.You can donate by bank transfer though :pI'll deploy the fixes in an hour or so.Thank you very very much for your comments and positive feedback !! I would love such a spec be put together, that might mean if bitcoin-central.net, my new baby fits in i'll get to collect the bounty the day i feel like opensourcing  Yes, that's right, some extra competition in the bitcoin trading field!Features : - A nice interface, - No need to send XX.YZX bitcoins to the ABC address, use any of your addresses! - Trading, for free, as in beer, good dutch beer, - Trade for EUR and USD (liberty reserve for now), - MyBitcoin like features to come (MB interface compatible SCI) - Bootstrapped with a couple of interesting trade orders, - Oh, did I mention trades are free ?Sign-up and stay tuned for more delicious features !  you mad?  it's funny that you're selling gforces  Define "plug in to mt gox" Absolutely, but that's a very serious limitation when dealing with addresses that are very often generated and then used only once.But maybe that's acceptable depending on the use you want to make of such a feature.Yes, look at a raw block with at least 2 txns in it at BBE, you'll find answers  I'm merely presenting two sides of the same coin and two reasons to not worry about something that is in no way an issue.Nobody knows whether it will actually matter, maybe bitcoin will be used the same way as gold, to store value, maybe it will be used everyday by my girlfriend, maybe it will be used to back other currencies.What could really harm acceptance is a weak economy where it is hard to get a hold of real goods and service in exchange for your currency, no matter whether this currency is called "bitcoin", "bitcent", "nanocoin", or "john mac douglas the third".I never said users wouldn't notice, I said they wouldn't care, as long as they get to manipulate almost-integer values.It's not how many bitcoins are issued that matters, it's whether it's possible to order 24/7 sushi with them that matters.Educate yourself about the protocol, you'll discover that it's future-proof in lots of ways.You're free to keep worrying, that would suck though, I don't like worrying.  http://progit.org/book/ was my best friend for a week  Nice, I didn't know they were selling outside of France.They have pretty good and professional service.They answer the support tickets very quickly.A bunch of months ago they auto-opened a support ticket on one of my servers stating they had to check "cpu cooling" (yes, generation is CPU intensive XD), they promptly fixed everything.So I don't know about this particular server, but OVH is reliable I don't really see how to get a public key from it's hash. Sorry, but... L.O.L. When I mentioned double spends in my first post I was merely speaking about the following case : - I buy an item giving a copy of my wallet (first spend) - I spend the coins contained in the original before the payee does (second spend) Whether merchant X or Y supports bitcoin is up to them, if they see a profit opportunity, they will make it happen, no matter how many decimal places bitcoin has.You guys are worrying about something that could only happen if bitcoin was widely adopted, fearing that it would prevent its adoption by new users. You see how it is a non-issue ? Het is niet makkelijk, maar mijn is bijna klaar Wilt iemand testen ? You misunderstood, nanoCoins would be integers displayed to the user handled under the hood as 1e-9 BTC.Transferring 1 BTC to this client would display a balance of 1,000,000,000.This really shouldn't be worried about My point is : I do not think bitcoin will be good at handling lots of micro-payments, it is by design. Nor do I desire this capacity. Of course, if someone removes limitations without impacting the core functionality, sure!But from my experience and the information I gathered from different sources it seems to me that it can't be achieved in such a way, therefore I think micro-payments will be handled by bitcoin banks, not by the block chain. And from my experience, this position seems to be a consensus amongst the bitcoin community.
which provider is it?dedibox or OVH ? just hack the user_balance table or whatever table inserts  This is a non-issue, make a client that displays your balance in nanoCoins and BOOM, your supply is now 21,000,000,000,000,000 NTCProtocol and client evolutions will introduce 10 extra decimal places if it ever becomes a need. I don't know what your desires are unless you express them.Perfection would be nice of course. But it would be just as nice to me to have mechanisms handling that outside of the core mechanism.That's not realistic, you'll always have trade-offs.Yes, there is a documentation of the protocol. Yes, a bitcoin bank would make money off of internal transfers transaction fees in my opinion, not on loans, future will tell  I found $199 You might want to hash a payer/payee's address to see if he's reliable or not before conducting business, and the aforementioned might care about his/her privacy. Ja, ik hoef ze niet maar ik zou graag een mtgox-like website openen met LRUSD and LREUR opties.En sorrie voor mijn nederlands, ik gebruik it meestal voor nederlandse-toerist mindfuck als ze in frankrijk komen  See http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf chapters 7 and 8You seem to assume that it is desirable that bitcoin be good at micro-payments, I don't think it has any importance whether the core protocol is inefficient at it or not. Zouden jullie bitcoins kopen voor LREUR ? As long as the block size is irrelevant That transaction processing is subject to the market does not eliminate the requirement (in my view) to understand its algorithmic performance characteristics.[/quote] - I'm a client, I broadcast a transaction to the network and all of its miners, - I'm a miner, I get the transaction, I include it in my merkle tree (inexpensive), and I keep mining. The mining algorithm is basically brute force SHA hashing on a fixed size message, so it's o(1) in relation to the number of transactions that are included in the currently mined block. - If I find a block I broadcast it (see research on P2P technology in relation to performance/thoughput/you name it) - A block is broadcast to me, I update my merkle tree and root and I keep crunching (every 10 minutes on average), I would (maybe naively) assume that the merkle tree update is o(n) in relation with the number of transactions that were previously included in the candidate blockHmm, writing this post I'm starting to think it might be nice to have a full fledged, peer reviewed, detailed, and thorough analysis of all the factors that need to be balanced for optimal performance but that doesn't change my main opinion which is that bitcoin won't be good at micro-payments. Could anyone educate me about the interest of coding a bitcoin client in shell script ? (protip : "just for fun" is a valid answer:) ) Increasing everyone's wallet value = people get to decide what is "good use" = democracy = you're against democracy = you're a fascist = you're probably a nazi = godwin point = /thread  Deflationist currency + "don't reduce wages below contractual value" = /thread  It does not scale well for micropayments as every single transaction has to be written down forever in the blockchain stone.You are mixing up different things. - Performance of the bitcoin client algorithms used for transaction verification - Performance of transaction processingThe former is described in satoshi's PDF.The latter is, by design, subject to the market (see transaction fees)You have to define more clearly what you mean by "completed" for a transaction. Bitcoin transactions are broadcast instantly to the network and currently propagate pretty fast (seconds). Is that a "completed" transaction ? Or is it "completed" when it's buried under three, six, a million blocks ?I think the community is eager to get reviews on satoshi's paper, I won't call it peer review because it has never been stated anywhere (to my knowledge) that satoshi is a researcher, he might even be a group of people.See previous answers, and welcome  See previous posts in same thread, bitcoin banks will handle that much better than any blockchain. More ecological but the result would be different as my wallet wouldn't be worth more  People care about privacy, also http://tinyurl.com/366mf2y You'd fail, hardReally?You're funny
Yes it will Sounds like a job for a hacker king  Why are you guys so obsessed with paying taxes in the first place ?  A cleaner way could then be to send someone an already signed transaction that would just be broadcast whenever the bitcoin network becomes reachable. Well, it doesn't solve the double spending problem much better acutally. But I mean in the friends use case, why not simply promise the coins and transfer them once the network is available ? jimbobway, your solution makes sense for small amounts where there is some level of trust (I'd rather not be expected with a shotgun next time I go buy cigarettes), but there would then be the problem of employees being able to easily steal from the shop by simply copying a file. just let me screencap it before XD how would you prevent double spending ? We seem to have a woman in this very forum.And she just contributed a patch.Need I say more  +1I don't trust satoshi, I trust the math behind bitcoin. The nonce overflows very often, but the timestamp changes often too , and even if it didn't the merkle root can Just randomly generating a key that was lost and held lots of money  Nice work, haven't tried it myself, here is what I use so far in a Rails app.Can't be bothered packaging it into a gem right now though.Bitcoin client, autostrips underscores for more pretty codeCode:module Bitcoin  class Client    def initialize      config_file = File.open(File.join(Rails.root, "config", "bitcoin.yml"))      config = YAML::load(config_file)[Rails.env].symbolize_keys      @client = JsonWrapper.new(config[:url],        config[:username],        config[:password]      )    end    def method_missing(method, *args)      @client.request({          :method => method.to_s.gsub(/\_/, ""),          :params => args        }      )    end  endendCode:module Bitcoin  module Util    def self.valid_bitcoin_address?(address)      # We don't want leading/trailing spaces to pollute addresses      (address == address.strip) and Bitcoin::Client.new.validate_address(address)['isvalid']    end    def self.my_bitcoin_address?(address)      Bitcoin::Client.new.validate_address(address)['ismine']    end    def self.get_account(address)      Bitcoin::Client.new.get_account(address)    end  endendmy JSON wrapperCode:require 'net/http'require 'addressable/uri'require 'json'module Bitcoin  class JsonWrapper    def initialize(url, username, password)      @address = Addressable::URI.parse(url)      @username = username      @password = password    end    def request(params)      result = nil      full_params = params.merge({          :jsonrpc => "2.0",          :id => (rand * 10 ** 12).to_i.to_s        })      request_body = full_params.to_json      Net::HTTP.start(@address.host, @address.port) do |connection|        post = Net::HTTP::Post.new(@address.path)        post.body = request_body        post.basic_auth(@username, @password)        result = connection.request(post)        result = JSON.parse(result.body)      end      if error = result["error"]        raise "#{error["message"]}, request was #{request_body}"      end      result = result["result"]      result    end  endendA validator for proper bitcoin addresses (validate :foo, :bitcoin_address => true)Code:class BitcoinAddressValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator  def validate_each(record, field, value)    unless (value.blank? or Bitcoin::Util.valid_bitcoin_address?(value))      record.errors[field] << "is invalid"    end  endend Yea, that particular edge case makes it pretty hard to track payments and map the transactions to database records  you have to wait 120 blocks before the coins mature,otherwise you might spend coins that were generated on a chain fork As far as I understand, the client won't pick up the balance available to a wallet if you just drop it in place of another wallet.So, is there another way other than simply discard your blockchain and force a re-download ? Or maybe I missed something  We don't want our gold to be taken from us again and sold for bitcoins  I would vote with my CPU for a miner that allows non-standard transactions including fixed-size arbitrary data for free.As far as I understand, since recently the standard client won't mine blocks including such transactions but will nonetheless recognize as valid blocks that include them (hence the vote for a particular modified miner) You must be young if you only learnt that today  http://tinyurl.com/2bkyorr That's nice !So, what is the output going to be like if the transaction is sent to one address and if it is sent to multiple addresses ? Let's make it happen :1. I sell you my bitcoins2. you buy them for 1$ each3. 4. profit and parity !!
Here they are :https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcointools If bitcoin claims they are spent, then one must simply hold the key to the address they were spent to.If the key is lost, yes they are in limbo, but spent limbo  As I said, there is at least the need to be able to export the keys, which isn't possible with the current client.Other people have also expressed interest in this feature, so let's just see where it takes us You can use gavin's python tools to export the keys and fiddle with them externally and that is good since you can achieve the desired functionality, but there's no guarantee he'll have time to maintain them and keep them compatible with future versions.I think it's an important property of cash to be able to show without giving, don't you ? You cannot prove you hold the funds associated to a given address with PGP, that's what I want as a feature.Whether I only get to extract the key from the wallet to use it with another tool instead of directly from the bitcoin client is irrelevant.Identification is irrelevant here...i don't doubt you triedaccounts are very different things than addresses, lurk a little more Nothing is stuck in limbo, it's either spent, or not spent. want Yea, you're right, but that is time-consuming and involves taking legal risks.I vote liberty reserve and liqpay, I'm definitely very far from an expert at e-currency though, maybe nanaimogold has some tips.Yes, it's a bit confusing, but nonetheless market regulated.I don't really like dark pools, I think BTC rate would be much lower without them, but then again, if people want to buy/sell without the transactions getting advertised it's theirs to decide I guess Theoretically, it should give the exact same results.Yes, we'd better get back on topic or gene might lodge a formal complaint  I'd like to implement matchmaking using e-currency rather than accepting bank wires from people, I think it's way too dangerous to accept wires, if it gets successful you're bound to attract bad government people and face money laundering charges. But that's only my opinion That's if you want to be an exchanger and make a profit by buying and re-selling currency, not exactly what I want to do, additionnally, I think the BTC/EUR rate should be purely market-regulated which makes things much easier  just generated a block of my own, felt like joining the pool for a little while again too  I'm pretty sure that once the block chain is up to date you'll see your transactions. I'm thinking about creating an European exchange.Any ideas about what should be implemented in the process ? I think it doesn't really matter whether the transaction fee is .1%, .65% or 10%, there is a psychological effect to having a fee no matter how much.If people really want to buy/sell it doesn't really matter that much, but for people merely playing with their bitcoins like me it made a huge binary difference  It is not redundant, balance is linked to a bitcoin private key, not to any PGP one.No you do not need any trust. Don't take it bad, but please educate yourself a little bit more about bitcoin internals. You can still concur  Would you guys trade with LREUR ? PGP is cool, but how about signing data with your bitcoin private keys ? Oops, you can't (well you technically can with gavins python tools).One of the properties of cash is that I can show you the money before you go get the goods, I'd love to be able to do the same thing with bitcoin in a simple way. I'm not OK with the previous UID-whatever post and I don't associate myself to that.However, I think you owe slush an apology. (Oh yes, you should also remove this thread from your signature, OR make a big fat clarification about slush's honesty) Lots of people are thanking slush for his work, since you're not complaining anymore it can reasonably inferred that people have all been paid  This is what you are getting wrong : - your bitcoin address is derived from your *public* key, there is not point in signing anything with this key or with your bitcoin address - you sign outgoing transactions with your *private* keySo if you're able to sign arbitrary data with your *private* key that means you get to spend whatever amount is associated with the *public* key (or its derived form, the bitcoin address) that is visible in the bitcoin block explorer.There is no need for anyone to trust you to be Helmut, and additionnally trust that 123456 is Helmut's public key.
Well, I can think of plenty of cases where I want to check that someone actually has the funds he claims before conducting some business. None of them involving taxes.You seem to think that such a signature would be valid only at a certain point of time, it isn't the case. If I sign arbitrary data with one of my private keys, it just basically means that I get to spend the funds associated with the bitcoin address, the available amount to an address is publicly visible from the blockchain.So at the time of signature i can say "okay this person has 10 BTC available", I can also come back two weeks later and see that the signature only credits its owner with 1.42 BTC. It's still good and can be re-checked at any time against the block chain data.That's basically what's being discussed here, being able to use the bitcoin wallet as a keystore, which it ultimately is.Also, as stated earlier, signatures prove you own the private key that matches an address, an address balance can be checked at any time.No trust is involved, at any point.The point is not to sign the keys, but sign using the keys.That is pretty much what is being requested as a feature.Performing the signatures or exporting the keys pretty much solve the problem of easily proving ownership of funds.I would like to see the signature part in the main client, it does not add overhead to the protoco/blockchainl *at all* and can be forked and patched by you if you disagree with the consensus that seems to emerge.You are overlooking lots of things and you should probably spend some time reading about how bitcoin works. It does, you should check the command line options, they'll allow you to specify the number of threads you want running, usually one per core.Also you can try the other options and see what works best for you. Proof of ownership of the actual funds.You can't associate a key with an account. They're managed internally by the client.Point is you can prove ownership of funds by signing arbitrary data with a private key, so I see this feature as very useful. Yes, sorry, I think it's the other way around, I think slush should apologize to you for being so slow in fixing the free service he's providing to you.I'm sure he didn't find annoying and insulting at all to get called a scammer by someone whining because his 4.53 BTC didn't arrive fast enough. He's probably even thankful to you for helping him get up and do some work. Some people will owe you a nice apology when they get paid... That's a unix principle, not a bitcoin one.I like this feature, it's not overloading the protocol in any way and I can see a bunch of potential uses.Opened a git issue : https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/issue/6 I think you'll find if you search on "one radio network bitcoin" or something like that, brucewagner also gave the link, but I'm too lazy to search  +1, git being harder is a misconception, it's just differentit handles lots of things much more intuitively than svn does.but that's kindof off topic  Well, 87% of the surveyed women said that bitcoin did in fact reduce their wrinkles. +1* davout gets back to coding   I'll let other judge for themselves as to the merit of your earlier commentsyou're not being ripped off buddyI do. However, experimental software have their glitches, programmers need sleep, and there seem to be other pooling initiatives around. I should think you would also understand that.Maybe buying some off of MtGox would then be a good idea.I'll beg to differ, and you know it  Wrong, we worked on the issue of my miner randomly sending bogus data.Maybe you should be a little patient in addition to being so careful and diplomatic.I was actually adressing davidonpda who was talking about charity. But now I can start to see why he was reacting like that. People getting something for free (namely access to a pool) acting like they're owed speedy service, instant answers and complaining that people are "condescending" to them can get pretty annoying...The questions you are asking seem to have been previously answered...You're just going to make a fool of yourself and appear like an impatient and annoying person Imagining that people will scam you for such tiny amounts is just... funny... in a pretty sad way. People seem to expect some level of transparence because they're contributing something. Seems normal to me.What are you talking about ?Pooled generation is a good way for newcomers to get excited about something.I contribute ~600mh/s to the pool, am I more entitled to ask questions ?Chill down and be nice to newcomers, they are the ones that are going to turn an interesting experiment into a real economy.Feel free to do just that in your own pool...Why don't you just let slush answer anyway ? He's always been helpful to me and sent the balance that was displayed in my account.I don't really care either way, generating by myself or in a pool, I find it a fun experiment that has the potential to interest newcomers before they get to realize what bitcoin is really about.People asking questions should also chill down a bit  That sounds really good!Simple question : why not drop svn altogether ? git does a much better job, it's easier to follow, easier to forkAlso I think a really good thing would be a test suite, it would make it much easier to check that some pulled patch doesn't break anything, also it could be really useful for bug-fixing, having submission of a failing test and submission of a patch being two required steps for a fix inclusion in the source. So grondilu votes for anarchy XD I was getting the very same messages even before trying pooled mining I'm getting these too, didn't get them at all before git pulling latest miner version... Seems like there are problems with 5970's and apparent flooding, I think I'm going to hang out a bit on #bitcoin-dev  Hey slush, that's exactly what I get in my logs?enky, what are you mining on?overclocked GPU ?
I was talking about the "show profile" thing also PMz  Little question, is it by design that i have to go through the login step each time i want to check on my shares ? but it should absolutely not be relied upon as security measure Radeon back in the pool =) There is obviously no need to open the code, I mean, it's not a trust issue, like I want to *check* the code.I'd love to *study* it tho, and maybe *improve* it  +1I'd like to see where my 600mh/s are going  You don't seem to know what you're talking about  Guess I should at least have opened the source up hey slush,do you feel like opening the source of your web interface ?could give you a hand with impementing some stuff and polishing itit's Rails isn't it ? Which version ? Did you build it yourself ? did someone manage to connect jgarzik cpu miner windows build to the pool ?getting work decode failed when i try :/ Hey, going to throw in my Radeon 5970 for fun  wait a couple of hours and you'll be over 2Gh/S Hey momchil, i'm getting loads of these while running your latest git code, weird thing is that I'm getting these messages on only one of the two cores of my 5970, I don't really know what it means, should I downclock it a bit ?Code:16/12/2010 23:57, 1a8eed81, invalid or stale16/12/2010 23:57, 68c13670, invalid or stale16/12/2010 23:59, 910435fc, invalid or stale290592 khash/s @creighto : you never back that "only a nation could overpower the network" statement. Let me throw some numbers in.At current difficulty it takes 80 Gh/s to generate a block evey 10 minutes (source : bitcoin generation calculator)Last 24h, the network generated 7.71 blocks/h (bitcoin watch).That leads us to a network crunching roughly at (80*7.71/6) => 102.3 Gh/s which is roughly 171 Radeon 5970's crunching at full speed.You can fit two of those in a PC, so if bought in bulk we can assume we could buy a PC with two Radeon 5970 for, let's say $2.5kSo you'd need $213,750 to match the networks power, round it to $250,000 to have a comfortable margin.It's nothing remotely comparable to the resources a nation, or even a reasonably sized corporation has at hand. You mean when using listtransactions <account> ?If so, that's good!I'm still kind of worried about the duplicate ID thing, ok, here is an example.A single transaction credits A and B addresses, both addresses are on my app on different accounts.Things are starting to get bad if I try to use the tx ID to match transactions that the client spits out to the transactions I record in my database since an ID isn't unique anymore.Maybe a composite ID would solve the problem, anyway I think that if something is called ID it should be guaranteed to be unique (or collision likelihood should be limited to the probability of a hash collision)What do you think ? That would be awesome, it was the case in the previous unofficial patch.The rest is scary though.So that basically means that if you're relying on listtransactions to track incoming transactions to a web app account you're in deep trouble...You just need someone to forge that kind of transaction, sending 1 BTC to an address that belongs to his account on the web app, and 99 BTC to one of his addresses for him to be able to withdraw 100 BTC :/Even if such a withdrawal doesn't pass the "sendfrom" checks it's going to mess some things up like the account history display.(Assuming i'm regularly synchronizing the transaction history into my database).+1, that sounds like the most intuitive output"different things sharing the same ID" sounds really bad to meit could also be that each entry of listtransactions shows a composite IDAnyway thank you for your precisions  Sweet thanks a lot +1 it sounds sensible Is there a way to restrict the movable funds to funds with a certain amount of confirmations like the send* commands ?Didn't find anything like that in the wiki. I can't see a way, using the latest API to get the address that received funds.I can list the transactions for a given account, but even if I use gettransaction I can't see which address received the funds, nor can I see the transaction timestamp.
Si c'est vrai, alors on doit avoir un paquet bitcoin sur ta distrib Sur debian ca avance http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=578157 Of course not.The same is valid for gold mining, early birds got to mine big amounts easily.Putting coins into circulation doesn't have to be "fair".People who are still massively generating invested money into hardware and man-hours into converting the CPU miner to a GPU miner, you should be thankful to these people that they shared the GPU mining code for free.Conversion fees are market-regulated and are bound to go down. <shameless troll>That's already in the code, you're just not aware of it</shameless troll> Hé y a pire comme troll : vendre une action ebay en usufruit XD Ubuntu est une vraie Debian, en mieux  It's a client limitation and IMO lots of miners will remove it eventually. 1.00000001 BTC I trust grondilu to honor his promise =) 0.00000101 BTC No You got my point perfectly ! Transferring to MtGox is a perfect counter measure since everything gets pooled.However mt gox would then be aware of that. But that might be acceptable.Just wanted to point out the fact that the one-address-per-payment solution is a good start but definitely sufficient to achieve a good level of anonymity As soon as the person receiving donations spends the coins in larger amounts than the donations it will be possible to link the addresses together with the BBE. you could also schedule something like - ensure you have a sufficient keypool for your needs - every day/hour/whatever compress and encrypt the wallet, - send it to your gmail, NAS, whatever This is kind of surprising.You should let it download the chain, then switch the generation on, and finally see if it still happens.Maybe the part where it checks the blocks is the one that overheats... What exactly are you trying to acomplish here ?If you use the accounts feature of the bitcoin client you can generate as much addresses as you want for a given user.If you want example code you should state which language you want the example in  Fixed 1269.64380952381 1269.64380952381 Yea, took USD-EUR exchange rate, 20 CHF Swiss coin day price, last mt gox USD-BTC rate, and mixed the up  I vote for "it should", 0 should be the answer for when an account balance is actually zero 1163.418 BTC That's very honorable, but I still think it's not the case for a vast majority. Just my opinion tho, I don't have any numbers to support that I have no idea about the meaning of your acronyms  Anyway, I think things tend to sort themselves out when left to mature for a little bit.  
Haha yea I know, I was just using that formulation to avoid sounding like "hey that's cool but what are you guys waiting for to make a test suite?"It could be deterministic if using a set block chain, well anyway, useful and elegant testing is pretty hard but sooo useful  Didn't read the actual code either but it's really cool you took on your time to do these refactorings.As an addition, do you know if it's possible to write a test suite for C++ code? Please leave. He's looking to buy I think, not to sell. No. http://tinyurl.com/2ee2u2x Nobody cares whether wikipedia is more popular than bitcoin.Feel free to leave if you dislike what is being said here.Again, nobody cares. People write articles about what they care for.If it wasn't the case I doubt it would have very much content. Grondilu, maybe you should decide on minimal increments.650 btw   Why would you want it to be "unbeatable" ?Where is it illegal to donate to WL ? Didn't see it was in off-topic   I don't think this is the place to repost every bit of news you find relevant to money. 600 BTC Geen probleem, mag van mijn vriendin ook niet   Because you'll be the only one breaking only your only little subsystem, the network keeping to happily mine and transact while not caring at the same time. I always get 10 kilos of dutch food each time I go to Maastricht, or Amsterdam (stroopwafels, gouda, erwtensoup etc.) @ Albert Heijn.Can't bring back 10 kilos of my other favourite delicatessen, namely weed and sometimes hash, so yea I'm wondering whether we could conduct a small experiment of this type.Weed might be way too smelly but a little bit of dutch hash for christmas would be heartly welcomed  Anyone willing to make a few coins by sending dutch thingies in the mail ?  French version of the article hasn't been removed and seems to have less sources Maybe I'm missing something here, but I'm confused... How would getting knowledge of a public key be even remotely dangerous ?  Yes, that's basically what I'm saying, this vulnerability is "by design"   Thank you for the links!After reading the discussion, I wanted to say I like the idea of an opt-in safe mode, or remote kill switch.@satoshi : what do you call a longer invalid block chain ? like a longer one but representing a smaller PoW ?
Since keypools were introduced you don't need to backup after each address generation anymore.Your client generates a bunch of adresses in advance and feeds them to you upon request. Yea, you're basically rediscovering a known vulnerability, that anyone having over 50% of the computing power controls the network and gets to create all the blocks.If you have less than 50% it statistically just doesn't work (meaning its more profitable to be a honest node)Also, by doing that you'll quickly be discovered and therefore undermine the value of your own wealth.Even if a government was attacking bitcoin using such means, the rogue nodes could get identified by using a couple of simple heuristics and get ostracized by the rest of the network.  Can,you provide some more details ?Or a link to some documentation about these changes ? AFAIK, cracking SHA2 does absolutely not mean you can fake a transaction signature.SHA2 security ensures that miners actually throw in some serious CPU resources.If SHA2 was broken tomorrow, there would just be a freeze in the network, replacement of SHA2 and then back to business.Seems like such an emergency case has been planned in advance by Satoshi by allowing broadcast to all the *official* clients of a message signed with his private key. Or you can just edit poclbm source for a quick slightly securer dirty hack http://www.bash.org/?837510 +1 torrents woukd provide for a much better bootstrapping That calculation is pretty pointless anyway, they don't take in account how the value of a BTC will evolve.Also it doesn't take in account that maybe in a year the 5970 will be used for... gaming =) Yes, it's pretty easy to prove you actually sent X coins to an Y address yea, just zip your discarded wallet and check it back in ten years, see if something arrived by chance =) umm, maybe you should read the faq Personnaly, when I have annoying crumbs in my wallet, i just donate them to the faucet It's cool how the generation is instantly dispatched Yea that makes sense, so if I sum it up, with accounts : - (-) I can pretty accurately tell if some other address belongs to the bank pool (even if I'm not able to check an arbitrary address) - (+) I can send coins from addresses that didn't originally receive the coins, making them very hard to track through BBESounds fair! (S3502 + 1 ) 500 ArtForz just did the math for you http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2196.0It is very profitable. Even if you take my 700W power unit consumption as basis.The miner uses both GPU cores, each one crunching at +300mh/sThere is a problem /w ATI SDK 2.2 that prevents from running on both, but 2.1 works perfectly J'en ai jamais entendu parler.Je doute qu'on puisse avoir des CB anonymes, si tu trouves un lien je suis très interessé Should be fine, I remember reading something about what creighto mentions about compacting merkle trees in satoshi's PDF
That's out of the box performance.Overclock them with a twist of a commandline and you easily reach 600mh/s.I reach 620mh/s at the price of having to stay around since it loses some stability (perfectly stable at 600mh/s)Add 10mh/s from the i7 CPU and you can redo the math :pGenerated 2 blocks today, yay! Generated two blocks today on my 5970 Maybe I'll get an extra one before difficulty skyrockets, you also get free heating with these littlefat marvels That's what would qualify as "inefficient" in my view.Well, actually, when i say not efficient, what i mean is that i run the client on a fat linux box and this one is fine. *but* i also run a windows client at office, and each time it downloads a significant amount of blocks my hardrive sounds like it is going to burst in flames any minute.Code:david@bankbox:~$ du -sh .bitcoin/124M .bitcoin/This should not take 10 minutes to download on a reasonably optimized P2P network, not much longer.Bitcoin's network is probably not optimized for that, maybe we should think about using the bittorrent network to distribute fat chunks of the chain.On windows the harddrive sound is reaaally annoying, my colleagues even get curious as to wtf I'm doing with my computer Might be the debug.log flushes or the block chain, I honestly have no idea, but what matters is the result, isn't it ?Also it's a very frequently asked question : "when will my faucet coins show up ?" so it could be interesting to investigate. Consider yourself lucky not to be rolling on the floor slobbering with a blue screen in your head. You guys seriously expecting an accurate answer ? It does parse, the AST just looks a little funny too... lazy...  I hope the initial blockchain download is not going to remain as inefficient as it is today  s/money/sandwich/ It's just not as fun ! I would love a ruby bitcoin client so much !! as long as the fundamental properties of bitcoin remain there could be a lady gaga sextape encoded in the blockchain, i wouldn't care Funny how so much people are scared of what could potentially happen.So daddy doesn't want his young son to get out and go party like all the older currencies because he's scared ?Fair enough. He'll just go over the fence, have fun and ultimately grow up like all kids do.Bitcoin is in essence a subversive currency, let it be subversive, if you don't like that you're probably going to be less stressed out investing in gold.Also it's neither satoshi's neither anyone of us to decide whether wikileaks should accept donations. I'm still puzzled at how scared lots of people here are. No offense intended , I asked questions that probably seemed stupid to the people that answered me.Now I'm happily crunching at 600mh/s thanks to the people that helped me out.Maybe you should simply clone the git repo so you can transparently get upgrades and forget about this kind of issues altogetherYou need to apt-get install git-core and thengit clone <url>and then you can just git pull from time to time to upgrade. mind. blown. i like the word money  If one can, everyone can.Hoarded coins are irrelevant to the initial question Oh come on, if you really want to generate get yourself a nice Radeon 5970, you still generate a block a day with that I don't like IndentationErrorsNot gonna criticize what I don't knowI'll leave you the bob = new InstanceLocatorFactoryProxyWrapper<GenericInstanceBuilder>(); i wouldn't mind tipping to see what i'm thinking about  +1
Sounds like another use for a tip jar  It's actually reassuring that free money isn't very easy to get  Depends on too much variables to be relevant I think.You have to take into account the exchange value of a coin, the price of electricity, the state of the network (how much computing power is competing with yours for generation) etc. Bitcoin is supposed to be what users say its supposed to be. lol I wrote a bitcoin daemon wrapper in RubyFully extensible since it's heavily based on method missingEDIT : Made it for Rails so it includes a lovely initializer and a sweet yml configuration file Looks like no I was going to say I liked little men but figured how it could be interpreted XDSo, yes, thanks for your explanation, makes things very clear.However, that would allow someone holding an account at some online wallet site to know that some address belongs to the wallet system, do you see what I mean ?That might be problematic for privacy, maybe there should be an option to force the previous transaction selection algorithm to choose only transactions to a given account (which could also fail meaningfully when trying to send funds from an account that came themselves from an account transfer).As far as I know it can't be handled at the application level.Well anyway thanks for the accounts feature, it works very well ! Accounts with significant balances are likely to be closely monitored as I said, so there wouldn't be much to gain.Also this can be easliy beaten by having to publish a list of opened/closed accounts, so everyone can check the counts match, if suddenly an account is missing in the global balance sheet then that means that it has to be accounted for somewhere else where it can be scrutinized.If a bank wants to hide an account it has to take the risk that someone is going to find out their account has been claimed as closed. Not worth the risk.That would be plain stupid, it would make for an even worse reputation : "we do banking, our software is buggy, yea you can trust us".So that's a non issue.Even stupider idea of them to do such a thing, the day someone double checks they're dead.Point is you can't If you advertise the fact you're not fractional reserving, and you put such control mechanisms up there's no way you could effectively cheat and gain something worth a tenth of the risk out of it.The good part about that system is that it can be automated and checked by a third party who has no financial incentive in addition to random skilled people checks.A whistle needs only to be blown once I need to go do some fiat currency paid work :p So, how is the balance of an individual address managed ?Lets say two accounts have an address each, i send 100 to address 1, then move the funds between the two accounts, will bitcoin actually use the first address for sending when sending coins from the second account ? Maybe someone should mention http://www.oneradionetwork.com/money%10finance_-_podcasts/the_economy/the_new_digital_money_-_bitcoin_with_bruce_wagner_-_12-02-10_201012021972/ Hopefully the place where i put my saving lasts more than one year so that's a non problem.also s/inactive/inactive after an arbitry amount of time has passed/No, because that would be a basic accountability rule : publish a report, on demand that shows anonymized accounts along with their respective balances. Skewing statistics is irrelevant here because such a report wouldn't be about statistics, we're assuming publishing *all* the account balances are published since it's part of the hey-check-it-out-for-yourself-we-don't-do-fractional-reserve set of rules.Of course not, if a user sends funds to another user, the sum of the balances of the full account balances report will still end up as the exact same figure.With a couple of honeypot inactive account this system just works. (Or even if the "bank" thinks there are going to be honeypot accounts). I just read your description of the cleaning process.I think that instead of decoupling wxw from the code you should drop it altogether and just make it easy (JSON-RPC is easy  ) to implement one as an extra layer. If you're bored you should learn some Ruby it's really sweet ! Nope, you couldn't really cheat like that because maybe I deposited 10 BTC in an inactive account to catch you red-handed.And you could only do that with accounts with small balances therefore reducing your cheating ability.So high risk of getting caught, not so great benefit.You don't even need the BBE part to check for the absence of fractional reserving anyway.You'd need BBE to check that what you send to the address that is given to you remains as balance of that address, which should be the case I guess with the accounts functionality of the client. No, the users can collectively verify that the data is good :hash of my account id lined up with my balance is easily verifiable.If one single user comes up and says "i didn't find my account id hash, or it had incorrect balance" you know the bank is cheating.How do you cheat that ? A single "this is our safe" address + BBEEDIT : + a published list of anonymized accounts with their respective balances, every user should find his own and the sum should be equal to the balance of the "safe" address And probably not the best thing to send bitcoins through email at all.Look at it this way, they have no incentive to setup any spam prevention measures : domainkeys ? ugh that's complicated.Meh, natural selection will do its job. Well I might be wrong here, but I heard that under traditional islamic laws, usury, and thus lending for interest are forbidden.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_bankingAfter seeing that money as debt video, that sounds like a pretty good thing ! I'm not sure about cold selling bitcoin to people using the e-mail send feature.I think having people make a small committment by downloading the software is an important step to go from : - hmm, whatever, i already have some habbo dollars, to - wait, wtf, there can be... money? on my hard drive?Mybitcoin is cool but it's an online banking experience, the bitcoin client is something different, it's a real dematerialized cash experience and I think it makes a biiiig difference in how people perceive what they're being gotten into 
mtgox is obviously not full reserved since LRUSD and bank wires aren't dealing with the same currency, and you can fund your account with both. Oui je me suis un peu renseigné, ca existe.La raison pour laquelle je me suis pas lancé dedans c'est que c'est nominatif et qu'il y a des frais de départ il me semble.http://www.bnpparibas.net/banque/portail/particulier/Fiche?type=folder&identifiant=Carte_cadeau_BNP_20071017103315 Il faut que tu regardes les cartes supportées par opencl et le ati stream sdkma radeon 5970 est supportée Just wondering about the following example :I broadcast a transaction, sending X coins to some address.Doesn't get included in blocks for a while because I don't include a fee.Do I have a way to cancel it and broadcast it again with a fee this time ? Qu'est ce que tu veux dire ? You're forgetting block hash collision Thanks for doing the math, I didn't manage to get Mathematica working so i dropped the calculation altogether.Guess p is much smaller than I expected  true Yea but that has nothing to do with bitcoin You already have that They're too busy bitching You should generate on your GPUs, CPUs are pretty uneffective for generation.  didn't read that part, yes you can, just use the sendtoaddress command and it will bypass accounts alltogether Where are you located ?Maybe there's someone next to you for a face to face transaction. No, the address won't be valid anymore, there's a built-in checksum You probably won't find anyone to buy them with such a short posting history Nothing has intrinsic backing, except the food i can put in my mouth  You should submit a pull request through git to gavins fork No chargebacks, no comebacks XD Yes, that's right.I don't see any way to get a list of accounts. However getbalance will show the global wallet balance whatever the accounts partial balances are associated to.
The SVN version includes the graphical GUI.Just use your wallet with any copy of the client and your coins should be available, accounts are irrelevant here. C'est juste qu'en comparaison avec un GPU, un CPU est inadapté.Ex :  - sur mon core i7 je tourne à 10mhash/s -> 40 jours en moyenne pour générer un block avec la difficulté actuelle - sur ma Radeon 5970 je tourne à 300mhash/s par GPU, sachant qu'il y a deux GPU dessus je génère un block toutes les 16 heures en moyenne.La génération avec GPU marche à merveille sous linux, c'est ce que j'utilise. You have my war-lemurYes, absolutely.Or when a big pile of LRUSD is thrown at them I wouldMy fear is bitcoiners over-fearing if that makes any senseAs long as SHA256 hashes are still legal in France I'm fine with everything  That sounds like a great idea. There is no such thing bug-free software, and there is no such thing as weakness-free protocol.You might plug a couple of holes by investing a lot of resources but you will never have any guarantee that there aren't any remaining.Waiting for perfection before confronting reality is the best way not to acomplish anything at all.Wrong. A "tiger team" tries to think and anticipate very hard on what will happen when the actual confrontation takes place.Time will tell I guess Yep ~/.bitcoinIf you're using command line go for cd ~/.bitcoinIf not go for ALT+F2 and then type .bitcoin in the dialog box Well, that also means giving time to a government to catch *us* off guard.It's a self regulating system, the more attention bitcoin gets, the stronger its network becomes, the more resilient it gets to any attack, and it seems obvious to me that if we got loads of PR tomorrow, people would fire their GPUs before the NSA schedules a brainstorming session.I'd rather get out of my room and get creative with the girl I like instead of trying to anticipate everything she could say, try to guess what she thinks about me, try to come up with a master plan or anything.Same thing goes for bitcoin, I'd rather see it getting out there confronting itself to reality rather than sitting in its room trying to imagine what the NSA people will come up with. Time is also on NSA side Of course there are lots of governments around the world, lots of NSA-like organizations, that's something that shouldn't be forgotten You can't just shut bitcoin down, you can shut an american exchange down, but once you've done that you won't be able to shut the european one.You can overpower the network, but thats just temporary.And if a government were to try these kind of tricks that would just be free PR bringing new users, strengthening the whole system as a result.Anyway, it's nice to hear other people's opinions! I wouldn't be too worried about that.DefinitelyI think you're over estimating the risk of government attack while underestimating the benefits of lots new people getting to know bitcoin and contributing to the strength of the network.I'd rather find out sooner than later.Anyway, that's just one of the PR opportunities that we have now, I think the other very promising opportunity is getting a headless bitcoin client included in the debian repos. I think it should focus on handling its own evolution elegantly. Protocol governance anyone ? XD I disagree, deeply.Wikileaks get lots of sympathy from lots of different people, mostly people who care about freedom of speech and freedom of information.As for exchanges, closing one will bring ten other exchanges to life and stimulate decentralized exchange innovation.Confronting ideas and beta versions to reality is the best way to harden them.Just as kids grow up by getting experienced falling and getting back up bitcoin should get the most possible attention, if it doesn't get destroyed in the process it'll mean it's rock solid and will greatly benefit from the advertisement.If it ends up getting destroyed it'll just mean something need to be tweaked in order to make it better before rebirth.Satoshi is over protective, see for yourself, just check out the thread about including listtransactions in the codebase.Fear is always a bad counselor, but I guess it's proportional to one's wallet weight. See this as an opportunity, not a threat.As far as I'm concerned I'll support such initiatives by donating and/or accepting donations for wikileaks. We seem to have a different definition of a donation.You'd have to give me 100 BTC to eat sugar free cheesecake anyway. +1Debug logs are not very useful most of the time and should be opt-in. You could also add the possibility to define how bitcoins get split in case of dispute.Example : You could say that instead of a full chargeback in case of dispute you only do a 80% refund, merchant gets 20% How does it feel to get your dreams destroyed ?(as a side note i highly recommend http://www.food.com/recipe/dutch-apple-pie-omas-appeltaart-128732) Sounds great, exiting the client and copying the file would certainly do, there also is a JSON RPC call that can be used, but I wouldn't have any idea on how to do that with the GUI since I don't use it.However, you don't need to delete the wallet you just backed up, just explain clearly that using a wallet copy is like using the original. Coins spent from a copy will "disappear" from the original wallet.You might also want to insist on the fact that coins can be sent without any problem to an offline wallet.So if anyone wanted to protect their funds big time they could generate an address from a wallet, store the wallet on a usb stick in a safe and send funds to that address without ever having to bring it online, (only for spending the coins of course). timestamped waffles ftw Ce n'est que la vérité.Et puis ca l'encouragera peut-être à se renseigner sur la manière de générer sur GPU  Right now it doesn't really exist as far as I know.The bitcoin development workflow and the protocol governance are not very mature right now in my opinion.Also development efforts are mostly geared towards the internals, not really the GUI part.I guess you could always open an issue on gavin's fork (https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git), but honestly, I don't think much attention will be given to the allow-me-to-delete-an-address functionality.You can also fork gavins fork, code that up and submit a pull request, but again, it goes against bitcoins way of doing things to delete an address, but it's no big deal anyway. I don't personnally need it.If you really want to clean things up you can just make a new wallet with a single address, send it everything and delete the old wallet.(And I wouldn't delete the old wallet, I'd save it on a cheap usb stick and check it ten years later to see if any coins were sent to these addresses)
No, you're not the only one.Bitcoin would greatly benefit from getting included in the official debian repos.There is currently discussion going on, on the debian bugtracker, see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=578157The bitcoin code is also tightly coupled with wxwidgets too, and that's not a really good thing for inclusion in debian..You should fork gavins git repo and build up from there, you'll get the svn commits he regularly pulls into his fork along with a couple of very useful patches.I would love to see a headless client making it to the debian repo and I'll support it by donating (I'm a failure at C++). I can understand that there should be a way to mask an address in whatever client.But, it has to be clear to you that an address is merely a private key (not exactly, but thats a good approximation).Sending coins to an address actually means, publicly acknowledging that *only* the person holding the private key linked to that address can spend the sent coins.If you understand that, you'll understand that is it possible to send coins to an address that is offline, or even send coins to an address that hasn't ever been created by anyone.If some coins were to be sent to an address that no-one has the keys to would mean they'd sit in a no man's land for pretty much ever (or until someone by incredible chance generates the right address to claim them). That's a misconception.Getting an incompatible change in the protocol to be used by 51% of the clients will just lead to two distinct block chains, not the 49% remaining "accepting" the change. Absolument, ceci dit, la génération sur CPU n'a pas vraiment d'intérêt non plus. La génération partagée n'a pas d'intérêt si tu as plusieurs machines.Tu arriveras exactement au même résultat en faisant générer toutes tes machines séparément. In my opinion, the governance of the protocol and its versioning are two sides of the same problem.Once it is decided how the protocol is governed, versioning is pretty trivial.I don't think a single individual should be in charge of that, I'd rather some not-for-profit organization be created and some procedures get agreed upon. I think it would be a great step towards making the protocol much more stable, predictable and transparent. Ca n'a rien a voir avec de la génération partagée ce que tu fais.Ce que tu fais c'est simplement forcer la connection avec un pair particulier, et c'est assez inutile.Tu cherches à faire quoi exactement ? Tu parles de quoi exactement avec tes slaves ? Yea, I agree, also it's much harder to confiscate bitcoins The..... INTERNET What do you mean ? And it would also advertise strongly that bitcoins are immune to government regulations. And also, such a thing would be lots of free PR for the bitcoin concept XD Let's wait and see But, as you said there's a lot less the governement can do about bitcoins than about e-gold. Also some thought should be given on how the protocol should evolve.What governance rules should be put in place ? +1 and kudos to brucewagner for doing PR work! I don't really see on what legal grounds there could be a ban on exchanging numbers and information. +1 on replacing the client version in the handshake by a protocol version.actually both could be sent, protocol version as number and client signature as string Good idea, but I don't really see that scale very well lol, my bad
Yep, probably a very important application.Probably a very good reason for outlawing bitcoins altogether too I guess.How about chilling down for a second, sit down, have a puff?Yes, bitcoins make money laundering, drug trade, etc. much much easier.It's a fact, not an opinion that should be silenced because of fear. I think it's randomly initialized.http://stackoverflow.com/questions/827393/default-value-for-bool-in-cThey're not talking about the static case tho.Nonetheless this code looks really really weird certainly missing lines or context.// Okay let's initialize a variable to a fixed or random value// If it's true   // Set it to true,   // then do somethingReminds me of facepalming hard when reading stuff likeif (v == true) {    return(true);} You all seem to assume that bitcoins will remain legal  What gets louder as it gets smaller? A baby in a trash compactor. Sometimes, publicly voicing concerns puts more pressure on the service owner to fix it. Probably not, I still owe him half a coin though XD You don't even need to distribute a rogue client. A plain virus will do...Head towards the wallets, fetch the private keys, once you have the private keys you can spend the money.Rule of thumb : your wallet.dat is named like that for a reason And yes, the checksums, actually the SHA1 hashes are on the bitcoin.org frontpage (is it me or does the bitcoin community have a bias towards hashing everything XD) Yes, thanks for pointing that out! The best idea I could give you is : switch to Rails my friend  You made me smile... Long answer short : consensus. Because it's part of the widely agreed upon rules.You can create coins after the limit is reached, however, no-one on the network will recognize the blocks creating them.However, in theory, if the majority of the users agree on the fact that bitcoins should keep being created without a limit it wouldn't be a problem (except for the part where you convince lots of people to accept a diminution of their assets value  )I know it's going to sound pretty anal, but I think it's really important to clearly distinguish an implementation from the protocol it is implementing.Just to complete the answer, I could build a client that doesn't implement that check, but, after the generation is over, none of the blocks I'd generate would be recognized by the network, and the reason to that is simply consensus  I'll start, the rules are simple, someone tells a joke and has/posts a BTC address :  - you smile -> .5 BTC - you laugh -> 1 BTC - you ROFL -> 2 BTCI'll start with one, courtesy of redditIf you cheat, it's your karma points A horse walks into a bar. The bartender asks "Why the long face?" The horse does not respond because it is a horse. It can neither speak nor understand English. It is confused by it's surroundings and gallops out of the bar, knocking over a few tables. C'est pas très compliqué.Si tu programmes en Ruby ou Ruby on Rails je peux te filer le code que j'utilise pour parler au client bitcoin.Si tu codes en autre chose n'oublie pas de compiler la dernière version sur git (et pas sur SVN) pour avoir tous les derniers goodies.Est-ce que quelqu'un sait comment ca passe en compta d'acheter des biens/services à un particulier ?Les numismates, les trocantes sont des entreprises, et elles achètent à des particuliers.Mais légalement comment est-ce que ca marche.Vendre des BTC à des particuliers/entreprises ca poserait aucun problème.Par contre en acheter, je vois pas comment justifier ca comptablement, comment est-ce que la TVA s'appliquerait ?Je pense que si une solution existe, le mieux c'est d'être en auto-entrepreneur pour pouvoir facturer sans avoir a reverser de TVA à l'état, mais ca ne résout pas le problème de l'achat il me semble. No worries, the idea is just randomize the path of the funds through the system by mixing them up with lots of clean funds, so ultimately, instead of being able to say : - These 100 BTC are dirty, they come straight from a scammers addressYou'd be able to say - These 100 BTC aggregated to have 0.1% likely to be dirty (depending the proportion of clean/dirty funds you mixed in a single receiving address before redispatching them)Yes it is! It was safe for me, not for my bananas That'd be really cool if you implemented that, I don't have time to do it right now, but if I did I'd put a big fat picture of a laundry machine, a receiving address, and a big fat text box where people would input like a hundred of their addresses separated by spaces, commas, lemurs, whatever for them to receive their funds back in random chunks.The same would go for the people providing the clean money.Ideally there would also be a way for the scammer to set the fee he's willing to pay, the more he'll pay, the more people will get incentive to provide clean funds, the more mixed and randomized his laundered funds will be. You obviously didn't get anything about my idea.The idea is to prevent tracing coins by using the block chain, not your wallet/client/whatever info.Being immune to subpoena is easy, as long as you don't store customer IPs (access through Tor for example) you could give the FBI full access to your server it wouldn't be of any use to them.Maybe I'll be the first one to launch it after all  Absolutely none.Irrelevant. Make it accessible through Tor and you could host the service in washington DC. I think you should re-read the idea I gave in the other forum thread (http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=428.20), you seem to have missed a couple of key points...It doesn't make *any* sense unless you actually take deposits, pool them together in one address and then send random payments to everyone.mybitcoin provides the same service as yours but without the 1% fee =) Altavista was first too =) Glad you like it I think you're missing some key features though Going to be pretty impossible after I launch this service Scammers, send your funds to an address,people seeking to get extra coins send 5 times as much clean money to the same address.Funds get redispatched between lots of addresses with random amounts,scammer pays a percentage fee, I get a share, people who provided clean coins get their share
This makes me think I should definitely open an automatic bitcoin laundering service.Pay a small fee and get your bitcoins nicely laundered! I fully agree with grondilu, as of now bitcoin is absolutely not ready for what you call end users.And even if it was, I'm pretty sure they'd keep their coins in an online bank, not in a not-so-practical local wallet.Doesn't mean there shouldn't be any GUI, just means focus should be on getting popular with computer literate people first by getting into popular distros repos and on clearly defining and refining the protocol. Source code is good, source code implementing a clearly defined and documented protocol is much better. As far as i remember i just used an svn checkout patched with m0ms getwork.I've made a mass save of all my wallets and replaced them by new ones, i just plan on using them against an older version of bitcoins in a couple of months to check if coins arrived to one of them and then send them to my new wallets.I haven't seen any half-done accounts patch around, just built from git source when gavin announced the functionality on the forum.Anyway, if I'm the only one impacted it's a non-issue  -1, completely disagree here.Label functionality should be handled at application level (specific application that is).What if I wanted to tag my addresses instead of label them, and allow multiple tags for one address ?No, definitely, that's the application responsibility, whatever the meta-data you want to associate to an address you shouldn't rely on the bitcoin client to handle it.Accounts, on the other hand, provide with the very important functionality of enforcing a positive balance.Of course, that should be enforced at the application level too.I check for data integrity at the application level, but I still define referential integrity constraints at the database level, and I think it should be the same approach when interacting with a bitcoin client.

Dude, it's just a currency  AFAIU fractional reserve banking and margin trading are two very different things. Moi aussi je suis habitué de linuxfr, j'avais pas fait attention que c'était toi l'auteur  Tu génères sur quoi ?Moi radeon 5970 There is an IRC channel for over the counter trades.You might also get in touch with Valerius, he's buying BTC for liqpay, see http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1935.0 I think it's the best way for newcomers to get a hold of bitcoins.When I discovered Liberty Reserve and opened up an account I looked for a "Get LRUSD with your credit card" link for like 2 full minutes XD I think there have been fixes with handling of debug.log writes recently.IMO the debug log should even be disabled by default. Using 128-bit UUIDs as primary keys is definitely not a good idea.Even if collisions are highly unlikely in most cases it still is a really bad idea for clustered indexes.There can only be a single clustered index, and it's usually the PK.In other words, on each INSERT statement, the RDBMS will statistically have to write in the middle of the table.As for collisions, they might be more likely than you expect, especially if bitcoins get to grow old. Time will tell I guess.Also I'm getting really frustrated about this because I want to back and check all this with numbers, and except for Mathematica there is no tool that'll let me make interesting probability calculations. And I don't have Mathematica installed >< You're probably downloading the chain.Also downloading the newest client will probably fix your problem.If it still doesn't, symlink the debug.log to /dev/null  I think I opened a can of worms suggesting that Also,I'm ok with the client being self contained, if i really need to go read the DB I'll find myself a nice little BerkeleyDB wrapper On a side note, I'm really curious about how blocks and transactions are uniquely identified inside the client, through their hashes ?They're not guaranteed to be unique, and, over the course of time I think it's almost certain collisions will happen. I was wondering about that when asking myself what column to use for primary key... A really sweet thing would be the client storing its data in a MySQL DB I think the .65% trade fee made the market way less liquid than it used to be.
gavin maintains a git repo with a clone of the svn repo synced almost realtime.he also maintains some feature branches and a merge of the aforementioned.It would indeed be very nice if commits took place on git in the first place, i'm sure pull requests would flow.But then again, git is scary when you're used to svn.I once migrated a project i was working on with another dev from svn to git, i got loads of insults the first week, questions the second week, and the third week everything was going much smoother. This particular dev now has like 20 projects/forks on git  Would you guys use mt gox more if it provided a liqpay option like it did before ? Btw satoshi, you should give a shot at git, it's so much better than svn, especially with lots of patches and forks going around =) That's really nice.Will it be a drop-in replacement a patched client already used by GPU miners ? I'll go for 90.I'm able to pick it up in Paris, so less postal fees = even better bid  Yes, you're certainly right about that.I'd like to see an interview of satoshi, then again, satisfying my curiosity and explaining bitcoins to my wife are two very different things  The paper describes a protocol, the source code describes a client. I personnally used LP successfully.Just bought some coins trough mt gox when they still supported LP.Didn't try to get money credited back to my account though. I'll beg to differ.Often, people who aren't aware of all the technical internals are able to explain things in simpler ways.There's a reason why engineering and sales are different jobs  Ok, I'm just a little confused as to how the network will be able to validate the transaction since balances are associated to addresses and not to accounts.Like, how does it work if : - address A has 100 BTC available  - address B has 50,  - they're in the same wallet but owned by different accountsLet's say 100 BTC are moved from account to account to B's account ends up holding 150 BTC, how is the network going to allow address B to send 150 BTC to another random address ? Will call to sendtoaddress automatically use move behind the scenes if the two addresses belong to two different accounts on the same server ?Will that require a normal transaction to be broadcast ? Oh gavin, you know how to speak directly to a developers heart.  This is such a incredibly sweet change! It's good news for everyone, it just means it gets harder and harder to attack the network.People expecting easy free money are fools anyway =) J'ai compté toi + moi comme parigots Un site web.Pourquoi pas un RDV hebdo dans un bar parisien en complément, mais l'idée principale c'est bien un site web.Pour les rencontres physiques pourquoi pas, mais a ma connaissance on est que deux parisiens sur le forum.

Yea right  Yes, but it would also be very nice for non-technical people to be able to download miner binaries for their platform/GPU.Personnally, I already crunch at +600Mh/s, so it would mean I make less, but it would also mean greater incentive for newbies to commit into the system and secure the network as a whole.
Yes, of course I'm talking about databases, as stated earlier I don't do PHP (anymore).Suggesting to use strings says a lot about your coding skills/experience.Extra question for mtgox : correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think LR allows more than two decimal places when expressing LRUSD amounts, so, what's the point of storing more decimal places for LRUSD balance ? Rounding should be done at trade time, not display time, so no-one ends up with unusable dollar crumbs.Also, an easy solution for the which precision should be used for displaying i see two easy answers : - "You don't have that much USD" error message changed into "You don't have that much USD, your balance is XX.XXXXX" - Display full precision when amount is hovered by the mouse, pretty easy with title attribute I liked liqpay Une clef privée apprise par coeur et tu transportes ton argent dans ton cerveau  Thank you for pointing it out!I'll drop this piece of code anyway, I'd much rather rely on the bitcoin client implementation of the check.Was fun to learn some Python while porting it to Ruby =) You have it wrong, floats are not supposed to be used to store exact values, decimal types are designed for that purposeJust as a good math student can compute a block's hash with a pencil and some paper if he needs to. Anyway, that's absolutely not the point, I respect PHP for what it is, a performant language that's really easy to learn. Personnally I switched for Rails years ago.Anyway, I think the rounding issues probably would have been the same if coded in RoR without careful design and knowledge of the exact values handling good practices. Also *never* use float column sql data types, when storing money values decimal is the way to go.Edit : <troll>Also never use PHP</troll> See screenshot, this kind of stuff happens a lot. You'll probably end up writing way less code and get upgrade/bugfixes for free with an Ajax call. You get it for free as JSON-RPC call in new versions of the client.Otherwise see https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-bank/blob/master/lib/bitcoin/util.rb which is a shameless port of some python bit of code I found lying around in the forums, if you find that thread i'll add some comment giving credit.I would, however, rely on the JSON-RPC call now that it is implementes, gonna drop this snippet in favor of this simple call. Or maybe in some distant future people will refer at 0.0001 BTC as being "one" bitcoin Everyone can see the balance of any bitcoin address, this is by design.Someone correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think multiple addresses can "own" the same coins, the first one spending them invalidates the coins on the other address, so that's why, in my understanding lightweight clients based on balance sheets can't check transactions validity for themselves.However, if you use a new address for each transaction, or if you dispatch your coins on different addresses it'll be very hard to make a link between them.Basically, all transactions are public otherwise the bitcoin protocol wouldn't be possible. I'd only be interested in bitcoin-bank.comRegistered bitcoins-bank.com and a couple of others, also planning on actually opening a bank there. just registered a couple =) Doesn't' work like this.Your wallet holds a set of private keys, regardless of your wallet being 'online', the network will credit you with the coins.You need to put your wallet online only to sign outgoing transactions with one of your private keys, the network will recognize the transaction as valid since it will be able to check the signature with the public key the balance is associated to.So theoretically you wouldn't even have to ever go online with a massive wallet, you'd just have to sign a transaction on an offline box, and then take it to an online one to broadcast it.You might have to download the up to date block chain to put on the offline box for the standard client to credit you the correct balance, that wouldn't be necessary with a custom client that would let you create transactions regardless of your balance. I have If it is just because of lack of interest from the users that's sad, I found it to be the easiest way to buy bitcoins. Well, maybe someone will pick it back up. Sounds like a mission for Ruby on Rails/Django =) Create a new wallet somewhere, generate an address, put the wallet offline, send the bulk to this address.Your private keys will remain inaccessible since they're offline.You can keep sending coins to the offline wallet at anytime, they'll show up in your balance whenever you use this wallet with an online client. In France, payment cards charges are reversible.As for the liqpay thing I think both points are true : - They can't be charged back - They do get charge backs,So as I understand it, they get some of their payments reversed, but these reversals never reach the merchant.But if that is so, then why did mt gox drop them ? (or why did mt gox get dropped by mt gox ?) too many chargebacks on liqpay's side? Hey theymos, jsut discovered your awesome tool.If you feel like releasing the source, it'll be very appreciated =) AFAIK liqpay transactions aren't reversible, someone correct me if i'm wrong
  Go to sources root and then :$ patch -i -p0 < /path/to/the/patch Curiosité de voir ce que tout ca va bien pouvoir donner =) I think the more CPU power the better, if lots of people mine on GPUs it will be harder for anyone to overpower the network. I merely stated my opinion about a design decision that doesn't go much further than an implementation detail seeking the opinion of others.I didn't say it needed to be fixed ASAP, if I did I would have submitted a patch altogether.The same goes for example for the decision not to include the listtransactions method in the json api, I think it's a wrong decision, some people agree, but satoshi has the final say on what goes into his svn and what doesn't and that's fine with me, as we say around here "c'est le jeu ma pauvre lucette". If I really want listtransactions I compile a patched client, thanking people who actually got the patch together in the process.Wouldn't forcing standard clients to generate at 5% or 10% CPU be a big step towards security ? Maybe that would help ditribute more evenly CPU power and thus rely in a more balanced way on different implementations of the client ? If you call me an ignorant i think it's up to you to point out what i misunderstood.I'm not requesting that you explain stuff to me, just that you elaborate on your blunt and aggressive statement.So please point out my mistakes but keep your politeness lessons to yourself and don't yell at someone who actually did read the archive yet disagrees with the design decisions that were made, and would like to share some thoughts about it.So please do not feel like I'm asking you any sort of favor except for basic politeness when it comes to back the statements you abruptly make.Again, if you feel offended by the way i voice things feel free, absolutely free to ignore me altogether.Someone with super duper computing power would simply generate coins to make a super duper profit In my view bitcoin is also about complete independence from anything else than network consensus, the bigger the network, the stronger the security (and not the more hardcoded checkpoints, the better the security). I agree with you, it's obviously a minor concern about some implementation detail, I just think they are unneeded and could potentially create more problems in the future than they solve. Some people disgagree and thats fine as long as they elaborate =)I agree, but you'll have to admit that hardcoding the hash of any particular block is going to protect against that. Having a hash enables you to check some block in the chain, it doesn't address the problem you're talking about, chain lost, is lost whether you hardcoded some hash or not.Yea, I mostly agree, it's not a problem to hardcode a block hash from time to time, make sure someone doesn't generate a bogus chain from a bogus release etc. Now, making a policy to hardcode the state of the chain in *each* release is something different, of course it is an implementation detail that does no harm, nonetheless as you said the network is very very very secure the way it is and as a software developer i know that extra unneeded features sometimes bring more trouble than solutions.If I had craploads of CPU I'd generate + collect tx fees my friend =).I wouldn't try to break something as fascinating as bitcoin ! I see.Thanks for the answers ! Because it's peer-to-peer, you connect to multiple other nodes, each one of which will send you info about the chain they see as valid, your client picks the longest, simple and beautiful =) Ok I see, so it only makes sense if you re-sell them shortly after, amirite ? I'll probably be both dead and alive simultaneously when quantum computers actually show up brb, building quantum computer I symlink'd the debug.log to /dev/null  No block chain would ever be lost as long as at least a client holds it. What I see as a feature is what some people see as a vulnerability : the fact that someone could make a longer block chain by overpowering the network in massive proportions, but that's very very very unlikely to happen.And also I think you're mostly wrong about the reason for the longest-blockchain-wins rule. This rule means that the blockchain that required the most expensive proof of work wins. In other words, you can get the network to accept a forged chain, if it's longer than the chain it currently sees as the "good" one. However, that would mean that it took more CPU power than the whole network to generate and therefore the more powerful the network is as a whole, the more  the likelihood of this happening decreases.So no, this rule's justification is not to handle a marginal simultaneous generation case, but it's at the very core of the whole bitcoin concept.That's my understanding of the reason for this rule. I don't get how you'll be able to hold people accountable for negative balances Yes. But I think it's pretty unlikely, but who knows, if bitcoins get really widespread and they're very fractioned, lots of addresses might end up with positive balance, thus increasing your chances.However I'm way too lazy to even think of putting figures in front of such a statement  I'm not complaining, just pointing out something that doesn't really seem consistent to me. [advertising that the longest blockchain wins VS stating hardcoded checkpoints will be added at *each* release]If a block got hardcoded from time to time to avoid some bug then I agree it is a good thing. I don't really agree with the fact it should be a policy to hardcode blocks at each new release, and by doing so, endorsing an *official* block chain.And yes I know, I can fork the project, make my own client... no worries, i can svn co, up from time to time, keep a couple of patches around and compile my own stuff, that's not really my point, my point is simply to get people's opinions on what they feel is right. Because, even if what tentations statements seem really exaggerated to me, I still think he raises an interesting question and I thank people that actually tried to be constructive and didn't suggest I didn't have a clue about what I was talking about without backing their statementsAnd yes, the SVN example was really bad =) Ok sure, if you'd be kind enough to point out my misunderstandings. Oh silly me, you can't.If I didn't trust the blockchain I wouldn't be here.Also, feel free to ignore me.So, what happens if they go rogue ? (protip: satoshi is a human being)If the SVN repo gets hacked ?Yep, that's called open source, and I happen to like it a lot, just as I think voicing concerns about potential problems is part of it. That's a feature.Also bitcoin advertises there is no central authority, and that's obviously untrue, this code should either be dropped or its effects should be stated clearly in the docs according to me.Yes, absolutely. In some very rare exceptions a check for a particular block should be hardcoded.However, it should be the exception, and not the norm as satoshi stated in some previous thread that's referenced a little higher.The protocol is safe without it, it is thus unneeded and should be removed since no one should claim authority about whether some particular block chain is valid or not.Longest, hardest to compute wins. Therefore I completely agree with the thread title. The client, or the way it is advertised should be changed to reflect that.People suggesting to submit a patch are silly, if it reverts some of satoshi's code he'll never accept it.People suggesting to fork should be slightly more patient  thank you,i still disagree with it tho  EDIT : Fixing = reverting some of satoshi's code, for some reason I don't see that happeningAlso, no one actually answered as to why there was a block chain lockdown hardcoded, it doesn't solve anything, not even CPU overpowering attack on the network.
Yeah, they're called backdoors, an exploit is something completely different.An exploit is a documented and reproductible way to use a particular vulnerability in order to get to a given result (privilege escalation, DOS etc.)Smartly engineered backdoors can be very difficult to spot. The linux kernel is made by lots of smart people, that didn't make it free from any vulnerabilities. I think so too, but as of now, nobody has come up with a valid and sensible answer about why parts of the blockchain are locked by the standard client.The possible answers are : 1. In order to prevent some possible unknown vulnerability 2. In order to prevent some government to overtake bitcoin instantly 2. In order to cover-up for some known but not published vulnerability of the protocolSince, in my understanding, the protocol itself does not allow any other vulnerability than "beat me up with boatloads of CPU power" (which in my opinion is a feature, not a vulnerability) such an extra unneeded lock-up seems kindof suspicious.So I'm still waiting for a sensible explanation; if the protocol is as secure as I think it is, the lock is not needed. If the protocol is not that secure, then some exploit needs to get published and the protocol fixed.Either tentative is just trolling and trying to manipulate the market, or he needs to post some facts or outline of an exploit. This makes me really curious as to why it was implemented in the first place ?The near impossibility of forging a longer chain of PoW makes the system secure in my understanding without the need to add random "insurance" checks.The more code you have the more potential vulnerabilities, so why add code that is theoretically not necessary?I think that tentative is basically implying he could break bitcoin without these checkpoints if I understand well. I'm interested, now prove it, code is public, point out the lines, in my understanding the longest blockchain wins since it has the most expensive proof of work.Do it.Do it.Fix what ? Why not, i bet lots of people would be interested in protecting their assets or be the first ones to start generating in a "fixed" bitcoin brand new blockchain.Now facts please. Thank you very much for the answer, actually I was just kinda wondering. I actually only used liqpay for depositing like 20$ and buying some coins for that amount.I was only kind of surprised the other day because I wanted to try my brand new LR account to withdraw some MTUSD and it didn't work, I thought that the USD balance of my mtgox account would be backed by LRUSD on your account when you switched to LR, obviously it doesn't seem as simple as that.I was surprised you dropped liqpay, it seemed pretty secure to me, when I added the few bucks not only did it check my phone number but it actually, at some point, redirected me to one of my bank's pages that asked me about my birth date which in turn confirmed the whole transaction. I found it pretty convenient to use, seemed to me they had the advantages of PP without the chargebacks inconvenients.Just out of curiosity, why did you drop them ?Anyway, thanks a lot for the offer and the sweet exchange platform! That's really weird, so if I added 20$ with liqpay i can't get them back at a 1:1 rate? be it on LR? I don't really see how a trusted list of PK's and their balances isn't sufficient to decide whether a transaction is valid or not.You wouldn't be able to go check each individual transaction relevant to a single balance, but as long as the balance sheet is signed by some trusted authority, or some hash of it is spread on the network I would be ok running such a generating client.I'm assuming that when a transaction is made, both public keys are somehow broadcasted to the network so a complete credit list can be computed incrementally.amirite or am i still missing something here ? solde => balance The title says it all.Very often, when buying coins, i find myself adjusting the price to have an exact match with the available balance, but pretty much each time I get a message stating that even though I get the exact same figures displayed in my balance and in my order total I have insufficient funds...So wouldn't it be better to show numbers with an increased precision ?Am I the only one to get that ?Apart from that, I love mt gox  sweet! Yep, assuming block generation reward won't decrease, and that the bitcoin economy will be very liquid with lots of transactions...In my view, if bitcoin gains momentum and credibility, most transactions will take place inside dedicated services (some BTC bank credits the merchant account while charging the customer for example) and won't be going inside a block.I don't really see how suggesting that a program, running in the background, and taking 10% CPU on really low priority is a silly idea. If 20% of the people actually close it, 80% will just click the cross, send it in the task bar and help secure the network without even knowing it. As long as the fan doesn't go nuts and my desktop remains responsive I personnaly don't care about 10% CPU more or less. So I'd be really interested in some elaboration on the sillyness of this idea.And when I'm speaking about mandatory, I'm obviously speaking about the default widespread client, not about what the protocol should enforce.Why would a generator need to check for double spending ? Actually, a client needs more disk space than a generator.The only thing a "pure" generator needs is the hash of the previous block whereas a client that receives payments needs to actually check for double spending, be it with a trusted balance sheet or with the complete block chain.So that's a non-issue.EDIT : Well I guess a generator needs to check for double-spending when including incoming transactions, but that doesn't really change much since that could be solved with balance sheets, simply by network rejection of blocks that contain invalid transactions after they've been generated, or by a much smarter solution =) I didn't think of. You're missing my point, I'm just saying it would be pretty easy to overpower the network as a whole, and even make money doing that.And yes, maybe a couple of geeks will run to the store get a couple extra GPUs to get the fat transaction fees, but my opinion is that the network would be much safer with mandatory generation on the client with at least 10% CPU dedicated with low priority. What license are you releasing them under ? I think generation should always remain on, the only thing that should be tweakable is the CPU usage.People will do GPU mining until they realize that it isn't that profitable anymore with difficulty ramping up, electricity bills coming in, and an unexplainable urge to turn the loud fans onf their computers off.I think that getting noticed enough, for a government to dedicate a 100k$, budget probably doesn't take as long as you'd imagine, and then I don't really see what the bigger problems would be.If the difficulty ramps up a lot, and the attacker stops generating suddenly, having to wait hours between each block might be a problem. Transactions will be slowed down a lot and might get very expensive.You're making two assumptions : - In the future you won't be able to generate without the complete block chain - In the future every transaction will hit the bitcoin networkI think both are wrong : - There seem to be lots of solutions around that address the disk space problem - In the future, most transactions will go through service providers, like when bitcoins are bought or sold on mt gox, no transaction happens, happens only at withdrawal/funding time.My point is that, it is, and will certainly remain dangerously cheap to do so. Much cheaper than what seems to be thought around here. Maybe this is something that has been discussed before, but, what if a government, any government really, for any reason, decided to take down the bitcoin network or simply DOS the hell out of it ?My calculation might be incredibly naive, but if I take the figures from bitcoinwatch[1], and fiddle a bit with the bitcoin calculator[2] : - Right now (block 88894), 180 blocks generated during last 24h - that's a block every 8 minutes on average - average of 8 minutes for block generation would require 25 ghashes/sSo if my logic isn't flawed, the network as a whole crunches at approximately 25,000 mhashes/sSo, that's 42 Radeon 5970 graphic cards if i take the advertised figures here[3].So anyone with a little spare money (let's say 100k$) can successfully :1. generate at full speed with tweaked client,2. stop right after difficulty increase, significantly slowing down the block generation and transaction handling3. repeat after difficulty decrease,4. sell generated coins,5. increase crunching power6. finish by undermining trust in bitcoins, (advertise your attack, refuse to include transaction in generated blocks etc.)I don't think there's much incentive for regular people to donate CPU time which would make such an attack really hard : - On regular computers, with most widespread OS, generating gets the fan to be really noisy (might seem like nothing, but I personnally hate loud computers) - Generation rate is really slow unless you know how to get your GPU to do the workI think bitcoin security could come from millions of people donating a few khashes/s and not a few people giving a bunch of mhashes/s. My point is that I don't really see an incentive for regular people to generate.Is my logic completely flawed or should I just dump my wallet on mtgox and run ? =) European directives are not legally binding you until they have been translated to local law.Haven't heard anything like that in France for now. maybe missing font packages that make one font valid on a system and invalid on the other one ? I don't really see the point of copying the public key to the online machine.In any case, in my understanding, you can receive money on an offline wallet, if you just copy the up to date block chain to the offline machine the correct balance should appear for your wallet.Your safety measures become moot once you copy the private key over to the online machine to make a payment.Still in my understanding, the most secure way of making a payment would be to get a fresh block chain to the offline machine, somehow export a signed transaction to a USB stick and then broadcast it from an online machine, this way, your private key *never* gets in contact with the internet Maybe it's a little naive, but why not generate some addresses on a wallet held on a USB stick, safely store it somewhere and then send coins to these adresses ? the risk would be limited to someone actually getting a hold of the physical stick.or for more safety, do it on a bunch of them, but store the wallet encrypted and learn the private key by heart =)
