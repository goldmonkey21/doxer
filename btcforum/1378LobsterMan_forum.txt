This site is being spammed all over the place the last few days, I would stay far away from it... probably a scam, not to mention being spammed all over the web  (and darknet) "two weeks"Sorry, couldn't resist   I have blk001.dat - 003 and index in my main Bitcoin dir, then there is another dir Blocks that seems to have similarly named files, these look like they have a more recent last modified date...so I guess these are the ones I want to keep?EDIT: nuked everything except bitcoin.conf and wallet.dat and all seems well; had to redownload the blockchain again but that is no problem I saw these videos last year...I'm still not really sure what to make of them. That bill dude is apparently in jail for the next 3 years or so for failing to register as a sex offender, and the girl he had "relations" with was apparently actually 12 and not 16.So who really knows...the government has been known to use this kind of tactic to smear people it doesn't like; but similarly this bill dude could also be a liar.   My C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin directory has ballooned up to approx. 17 GB and I feel like this is larger than it needs to be...This is an old install that has been running since basically v0.3 and has never been modified or cleaned out.Is there a way I can reduce this file size? and which files would be safe to delete to attempt this? I am ok having to redownload portions of the block chain but I don't want to lose my addresses...obviously (I assume wallet.dat is the only "really important" file I need to keep?)EDIT: Sorry I realized this may actually be in the wrong forum section...please move this topic if it would be better suited somewhere else Isn't there some sort of "minimum" that one must make in order for it to even be taxable?Say...hypothetically, that someone was unemployed during 2010/2011, and did some small time bitcoin mining, but sold those coins back in 2010-11 and made less than $500 total from all the sales.Aside from kicking themselves for not holding them and selling at the recent peak for $260....would the said person be liable for any tax on that "income"? Hypothetically again, if it were conducted via paypal and the sales were done OTC. I get the same errors...I second this, and would love to have an updated standalone package...at least if there is I can't find it  So this will require a "forced switch" to the "correct block chain", but who exactly has the power to do this? I think a lot of the recent mtgox activity has been very shady, and I grow more and more distrustful of mtgox as time goes on...For example, often it will look as if someone buys up lots of ask orders in an attempt to pump the price of bitcoins up, but I think mtgox could be just doing that on their own. They could just, for example, cancel all ask orders below $7 or so, gladly take the bitcoins from the users and deposit these in mtgox's own wallets. Meanwhile they can just credit everyone who had one of the cancelled orders with mtgusd in their account that mtgox can create out of nowhere. This will then net mtgox quite a few bitcoins as well as bump price of bitcoins up too while giving the sellers the illusion of a legitimately completed sale.This is just kind of raw speculation but some recent market trends have me very confused and slightly concerned. When the mtgox price goes up rapidly after a large purchase, a whole lot of very low volume orders (like .05 btc or less) will rapidly be filled and the price will gradually go up as these ask orders are filled (it almost seems like the sum of all the sold coins would not be adequate to change the market price as much as it gets changed?). And then what?...this price increase is only temporary and whoever is buying up all these btc surely isn't hoarding them all only to buy high and then sell low once the price starts to slowly go back down? Maybe there is some arbitrage taking place hereThis is all really just (mostly; somewhat) unfounded speculation on my part....but lots of the stuff going on with mtgox lately doesn't make sense to me...so either I'm being very naive, mtgox is being very incompetent, or mtgox is doing something to manipulate market prices (or some combination of all three?) Yeah....the way this works out the scammer can conduct his scam without even having any capital of his own This has been popping up a lot lately in #bitcoin-otc and #bitcoin-court, I would suggest that this topic be stickied so that we may prevent others from falling victim to this deviously clever scam  Also check the ratings thoroughly. Just because someone is rated high and ident'd does not mean they are legit, there have been speculations about people pumping up their own ratings with multiple accounts It seems that bitcoin 0.3.22 does not work with the 4-28 version of poclbm for mining locally I don't claim to be correct in most of my answers and this is purely my take on things (I also have minimal formal education in economics), but I'll gladly add my 2¢   Well technically there is nothing to back them aside from their perceived worth, and their momentum as a legitimate currency as bitcoin (hopefully) gains more widespread acceptance.Also one could argue that they are backed by the electricity used to generate each one, which is a non-negligible amount. You could even go as far as to say they are "commoditized e-tokens" which conveniently package the use of electricity for re-sale, but this is kind of a stretch and is just sort of how I look at it. I suppose the actual cost of generating each coin is indeterminate, and the earliest coins would have used significantly less energy than the ones generated after difficulty has been 400,000+I think that most of the market force right now is speculation, as it seems there are still relatively few outlets selling physical goods and accepting bitcoins as payment; you can get lots of services for bitcoins though.I think this is still open to interpretation and depends where you live and what you're doing with your coins. If you really want to play dumb it's all just a "game" and you're sending e-tokens to other people that have no bearing in the real world. Obviously this isn't really true and I suppose there are likely tax and other legal considerations to take into mind when buying/selling bitcoins and stuff, but at the same time I think bitcoin still under-the-radar enough that you're not going to get an IRS audit for selling a few bitcoins here and there.From my own personal experience, I've been conducting a lot of my business on IRC (#bitcoin-otc on freenode), just directly selling coins to other people who will give me USD in my paypal account for said coins. Mtgox is still selling your coins to other people, but in a more indirect and impersonal way.Same as above basically; or you can mine them yourselfLike I said above, I think the main market forces are almost purely speculation right now, and this is coupled with the large difficulty jumps recently sort of propping the price up due to short term scarcity. I don't think that bitcoins have enough real world use to really be worth $9 each at the moment, but it would seem that most of the commerce right now comes from just buying and selling the coins directly, and the market is what determines the price..."Falls apart"? I don't think anyone really has an answer to that right now. The difficulty keeps going up which seems to indicate growing interest, and the web traffic to the guides I've written to get started with mining only keeps going up and up. A lot of this may depend on the legal ramifications too, but if governments start outright banning bitcoin that is likely to just make it even more popular. But right now...with the price so high, I would not say that bitcoins are good for a long term stable investment, but they are definitely something to keep an eye on, and make some money on the side with as well if you are able  I kind of agree here...long polling would be nice  Another thought, I think that if you add some sort of instant payout like deepbit has you will see more people using your pool This looks cool, I hope to see more stuff like this  Been seeing lots of invalid blocks lately, more than usual...anything to be worried about? Just chiming in that freenet is awesome and this sounds like a great idea I was using deepbit's pool for a little while while yours was down slush, and I was wondering if you are planning to implement a pay per share model?To me it almost seems like the people who are doing pay per share are getting slightly ripped off, and I much prefer the proportional method, but I am wondering anyway   Eagerly awaiting full status report  
I am also curious why many blocks have a number 0 and seem to be confirmed immediately... No   I just installed the 270.61 nvidia drivers, and it seems to make the drivers crash each time I exit poclbm by clicking the x, if I ctrl-c they seem to exit fine most of the time. Nothing serious yet, but I keep getting these in my system event log:"Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered." With the latest version while mining for myself, I seem to be getting intermittent "problems communicating with bitcoin rpc" errors. They appear and disappear seemingly randomly... I just wrote this guide up on how to use m0mchil's miner with slush's pool (a bit of blog promotion....   ). Please leave any feedback or questions/problems in this thread.http://www.newslobster.com/bitcoin/how-to-set-up-pooled-bitcoin-mining-in-windows Just wrote this article on how to use slush's pool with m0mchil's miner under windows:http://www.newslobster.com/bitcoin/how-to-set-up-pooled-bitcoin-mining-in-windows Not sure if this is relevant or important:I am getting intermittent errors while using m0mchil's miner with the pool on win7-64:Code:21/02/2011 13:34:44, Unexpected error:Traceback (most recent call last):  File "BitcoinMiner.pyc", line 210, in mine  File "BitcoinMiner.pyc", line 187, in getwork  File "httplib.pyc", line 974, in getresponse  File "httplib.pyc", line 391, in begin  File "httplib.pyc", line 355, in _read_statusBadStatusLineCode:21/02/2011 13:34:45, Unexpected error:Traceback (most recent call last):  File "BitcoinMiner.pyc", line 210, in mine  File "BitcoinMiner.pyc", line 187, in getwork  File "httplib.pyc", line 974, in getresponse  File "httplib.pyc", line 391, in begin  File "httplib.pyc", line 355, in _read_statusBadStatusLineThose are both from approximately around the same time, but each one occurred on its own graphics card (I am running 2 nvidia gtx 275 cards).

If you want to just use the CPU, the stock bitcoin client uses the CPU when you click "generate coins".As far as onboard graphics...I'm not too sure, I would suggest trying using different numbers as arguments when you specify --device=XFor example, I have 2 graphics cards so I have one line that specifies --device=0 and then another for --device=1 to use both of my cards. Try changing the numbers around a little bit, maybe onboard graphics is device 1, or even 2? You could take a look here:http://www.newslobster.com/random/how-to-get-started-using-your-gpu-to-mine-for-bitcoins-on-windowsThis requires an initial setup, but once it is verified as working you can let this run all day while no one is at the computer. (I'm not sure if there is a way to use this without actually having a user logged in and the programs launched by them) What do you mean "doesn't show up"? More info describing the exact problem you are having would be helpful.Additionally, does anyone have any input regarding the use of the ati stream sdk 2.2 for amd devices? Some people in IRC today told me that 2.2 may not necessarily be the ideal choice or even necessary for use. I do not have an ati device to test this on and I would appreciate any feedback so that I can ensure my guide is as accurate as possible... My hash rate is actually somewhat higher with the new version, I went from about 50mhash/s per gtx275 to around 58mhash/s, but my desktop is somewhat less responsive with the miners running now where it was not before This may depend on your card... I launch mine via the batch script like:start /DC:\Users\[username]\Desktop\poclbm_py2exe_20101218 poclbm.exe --user=user --pass=pass --device=0 -w 256And it works...I guess your mileage may vary   EDIT: Nevermind I guess I spoke too soon. For some reason the generation didn't register in my client until an additional block was generated, so it showed up at 2/unconfirmed   I just had a miner seemingly drop a block on the live network and this is pretty aggravating considering that I only generate a block maybe once a week....is there anything that can be done about this? Thanks   The new version seems like it may be running at 1-2mhash more than the previous version  
Sort of by accident I located 2 columns in the windows UI which are not re-sizable and are essentially invisible by default. They can be shown by pressing ctrl-"+" which is the auto-fit keyboard shortcut in windows to re-size all the columns on screen to make their contents as fully visible as the window size allows. They appear to the left of the "Status" column in all of the tabs.The first one is a 21 or 22 character string of numbers of the format 0000012345-1-9087654321 (and may contain a final trailing "-0" if it is a transaction where you sent coins).The second is a very long hex string of about 64 characters or so (I am too lazy to try to count them all)I would provide a screenshot...but I do not know if there are any privacy implications in disclosing what my transaction log displays (and specifically the contents of these columns).I am just wondering what these columns are for, and why they are hidden and locked by default?  At the time I am making this post, mtgox is not allowing me to sell bitcoins. Other people in #bitcoin-otc on freenode have also experienced the same thing in the past day.   Added a link to http://www.ozone3d.net/gpu_caps_viewer/ on the blog post, also noted that my setup involved nvidia cards when writing the guide.Are any additional steps aside from the sdk installation needed if someone is using amd/ati cards? Is this the link that I should post on my article? http://developer.amd.com/gpu/atistreamsdk/pages/default.aspx#fiveMy setup was done with nvidia gtx275 cards and I did not need to do anything "special" aside from obtaining recent drivers to get things working, thanks for pointing out that there are additional steps for ati users.Also, thanks for the input, I'd like to have as complete a guide as possible  romkyns, also, if you could post a new comment saying that you got it to work on my site I would appreciate it   A bit of shameless blog promotion....but I felt like writing up a proper guide to use bitcoin on windows since I couldn't really find anything like thishttp://www.newslobster.com/random/how-to-get-started-using-your-gpu-to-mine-for-bitcoins-on-windowsPlease feel free to critique and point out any errors or other problems, also please comment if you like it   Just took the time to write up a long post on how to get this working in windows (complete step by step guide)http://www.newslobster.com/random/how-to-get-started-using-your-gpu-to-mine-for-bitcoins-on-windowsFeel free to add it to the first post or tell your friends or spam this link all over the internet   I run 2 GTX275's, but I think that for some reason, when I specify -v it displays the cumulative hashes as the rate/sec, which is obviously incorrect. It crashes within 10-15 seconds anyway, so I guess nvidia cards just don't play nice with vectors... There was a post on reddit a few days back:http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/e6app/eff_begins_accepting_disruptive_new_p2p_currency/http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/11/bitcoin-gains-legal-protection-through.htmlnot really "notable" from the definition in the original post though..... New version works very nicely, except if I try to add -v to my launch options on an nvidia gtx275It crashes shortly thereafterCode:Faulting application name: poclbm.exe, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x4918019bFaulting module name: nvcuda.dll, version: 8.17.12.6099, time stamp: 0x4cb9d8c5Exception code: 0xc0000005Fault offset: 0x000285d5Faulting process id: 0x480Faulting application start time: 0x01cb8d411389c8bbFaulting application path: C:\Users\[user]\Desktop\poclbm_py2exe_20101126\poclbm.exeFaulting module path: C:\Windows\system32\nvcuda.dllReport Id: 5a9d2442-f934-11df-8ff5-0026185aa540 I think this may be considered money laundering and you may want to check your local laws   (crosspost from m0m's miner thread...but some of the replies there lead me to believe that this may be something that happens on the real network too...)I made a bit of a discovery when testing m0m's latest binaries in -testnet, look at the times when blocks are generated in the miners, and note that they don't all show up in bitcoin's UI:There seems to sometimes be a delay of 1 or more minutes between when they show up in the miner and when bitcoin picks up the transaction, if it picks it up at all.Is this something to worry about, or just a peculiarity of testnet? Other people have said that they "lose" about 10% of the blocks that they generate, which to me seems unacceptable if it takes possibly multiple days to generate a block....is there any merit to these claims? I don't think that is true...some of my blocks have shown up immediately with "0 confirmations" as soon as the miner locates them.That's....not cool   I made a bit of a discovery when testing m0m's latest binaries in -testnet, look at the times when blocks are generated in the miners, and note that they don't all show up in bitcoin's UI:There seems to be a delay of 1 or more minutes between when they show up in the miner and when bitcoin picks up the transaction, if it picks it up at all.Is this something to worry about, or just a peculiarity of testnet?  Thanks  If you want to make a quick launch for your miners in windows, just name a file something.bat, open it up in your text editor and then add a few lines like this, substituting your information:Code:start /DC:\Users\[username]\Desktop\poclbm_py2exe_20101102 poclbm.exe --user=youruser --pass=yourpw --device=0 -w 256start /DC:\Users\[username]\Desktop\poclbm_py2exe_20101102 poclbm.exe --user=youruser --pass=yourpw --device=1 -w 256The above is how I launch for my 2 nvidia gtx275's-w specifies the work size and changing that (use powers of 2) can affect your hashrate, 256 works best for me on my nvidia gtx275's, but your mileage may vary.Also do not forget to make your bitcoin.conf file at:(win7)C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\bitcoin.confor(xp)C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAMEHERE\Application Data\Bitcoin\bitcoin.confcontainingCode:rpcuser=youruserrpcpassword=yourpwwhich is what you use in your calls to poclbm.exebitcoin.exe must also be launched with the -server argument from the command line to use external miners.EDIT: Would still like clarification if simply using ctrl-c is an adequate way to exit these miners, or if there is a more "graceful" way to do so? There is a windows binary for open cl, which I have just recently learned works on nvidia cards:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1334.0 Any chance of getting a win32 binary of bitcoin.exe for 0.3.15 with the getwork patch?   I bid one (1) BTC Very nice, thanks a lot m0mchil, I'll send some coins as gratitude once I start generating some blocks  (running successfully on win7-64 with 2x gtx275's and version 260.99 of the nvidia drivers at present)I fire up one instance polcbm.exe for each of my gfx cards, specifying 0 or 1 to select which device:https://i.imgur.com/uONpy.png for exampleWorking nicely so far giving me 45-50mhash/s per card, vs. just around 4.1mhash for my i7 running @ 2.67GHz.A few questions:-I've obtained the patched bitcoin.exe and I run that with "bitcoin.exe -server", is this more or less the same as specifying -daemon? just that daemon has no gui?-Is there any "proper" way to close the miners? ctrl-c works but generates some weird warnings like:Code:Traceback (most recent call last):  File "poclbm.py", line 144, in <module>  File "pyopencl\__init__.pyc", line 286, in event_waitKeyboardInterrupt-At present is the only way to run these and be able to view your hash rate to have command windows open? I imagine I could whip up some sort of batch script to launch 2 of them, but that is still going to need at least 2 console windows, one for each miner? Just chiming in, on windows, you need to create a bitcoin.conf file and define your rpc username and pw in order to be able to launch 'bitcoin.exe -daemon', then you use the username and pw you specify here to call diablo's minerCode:rpcuser=usernamerpcpassword=passwordlikely located in C:\Users\[your win username]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf in win7And I cannot recall where that would go in XP off hand, but wherever the rest of the bitcoin stuff is storedAlso, I don't think that java is appended to PATH by default, so you will probably want to add that as well to use 'java' from the command lineCode:C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\binwin32 patched getwork binaries at:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1334.0 No longer needed Been trying for a long time with no success myself, perhaps take a look at this thread I made a while back to see if any of the problems you're having are similar to mine?http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1034.0 Any chance of anyone posting compiled binaries for windows? I'm still having a hell of a time trying to get anything to compile
