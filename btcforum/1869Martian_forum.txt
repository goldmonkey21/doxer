That seems pretty USA-centric. It seems pointless to celebrate victory over a single national currency. If it becomes the largest method of payment over the Internet, that might be worth commemorating. By design it's very very fast to verify a block compared to generating. A CPU has more than enough processing power. This sounds pretty interesting. Also, a new site for me to obsessively refresh. ;-)http://witcoin.com/witizens/57 I'd be interested in investing something along the lines of 50 BTC in this if it gets off the ground. At the moment my bitcoins are just languishing in my wallet. And it's a lot less capital to invest than I would building my own mining rig. This is definitely awesome. I wonder if medium businesses would run something like this on their corporate LAN once bitcoin takes off. Assuming it's worth the electricity costs, having company resources earn income while idle could be very attractive.Of course, businesses tend to have terrible pcs, but quantity has a quality all of its own. ;-)One thing is slightly worrying though. If, say, there was a very large global pooled mining server with a majority of CPU power, wouldn't it be able to produce double spending blocks? Hi I'll. I'm up for paying it forward.19HtGLVbfT4F9xxVS7qN7dzseeUcMiLjpa I agree with kiba. I'd like to see more games that take bitcoins. Though I'd prefer a Facebook style flash game, because I have really really terrible internet. I guess I'm a minority in that respect. But at the moment I'd be hard pressed to spend my bitcoins on anything, because they're still locked up it Mt. Gox with the 30 withdrawal time.
