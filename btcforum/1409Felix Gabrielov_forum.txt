bitcoin will never become big (or bigger than what it is already) for 1 simple reason: ANONYMITY.anonymity and money just don't go together. US government and EU won't allow this thing to make a step further.Tax avoidance, money laundering, no control over big transactions... Soon even prepaid cards will be dead, because VISA says it's all gambling money, terrorist money, there's no control etc.ACTA, COICA, DIRECT, Cyber laws etc etc. In it's current form Bitcoin has no future. There's just no green light for it.Â   the way i see it the main problem is that you cannot easily get hard cash for your coins.
