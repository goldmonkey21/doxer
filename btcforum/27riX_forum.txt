Hmm i paid something on a website, but I can't remember what it was. I had the qr code in my qrdroid history though.The qr code text in history is: bitcoin:1GTWuwvEMVLGSWCBgZcnBkBqS9AQER1RF?amount=0.0892..I guess that is according to the the standard.Look at that address and you'll see both the original transaction from the qr code and the 0.0002 top up I had to make.Edit: The qr code was from chunkhost.com Jag skulle kunna hjälpa till, skicka PM isf. Enligt det jag hört från Skatteverket när jag ringt och frågat så beskattas vinst på bitcoin som inkomst av kapital (30% rakt av). Vinsten beräknas på kursen som anges på de kvitton på affärer du bör kunna visa upp, dvs. inte någon kurs från någon exchange någonstans. Man får inte dra av för förluster, och om man minat så räknas det som att man köpt dem för 0. Man får inte heller dra av för kostnader i samband med t.ex. mining.Ovanstående gäller för privatpersoner.Gällande att inte skatta om du bara handlar för bitcoin, så är det inte tillåtet men såklart möjligt, på samma sätt som med kontanter du fått utan att skatta. I noticed a small bug; when scanning a qr code for sending with amount=0.0892, the amount sent was exactly 0.089, so it seems amounts gets rounded somehow.(Wrote this here since apparently Google now requires google+ for commenting in play store). I paid my ticket yesterday. Ett tips är att ringa skatteverket, det är betydligt bättre än att få info från internet.De har en avdelning bara för att svara på folks frågor. Ja bctx har jag aldrig ens hört talas om :pbtcx däremot scammade dig nog inte. Att vara rik är ju relativt, lever du på mer än existensminimum så är du redan bland de 8% rikaste i världen... No, under the assumption that there is no benefit at all, including profit, of calculating hashes you will not publish. Unless he was testing the randomness of the algorithm, but I doubt it.OffT: Why don't we just ask this guy? http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.45.1255&rep=rep1&type=pdf Unless you also hash for the nonces in between but discard the results.. which is of course stupid. In another 4 years people might see your post and say "wow, I wish I knew about bitcoin back in 2013". Note that the poll is from January 2010, bitcoin didn't yet have an exchange rate, some weren't even sure the system would work etc. Mining/generating made your computer slow, so getting only a few blocks every day wasn't really worth it for some.Fun fact is that I used term "generating" since "mining" wasn't invented yet :p When I created the poll I voted for the last alternative, this is still valid for me, but over the years I have gotten more interested in the potential benefits for the rest of the world than I was back then. I definitely wouldn't install that in my computer.First of all, CPU/GPU mining is no longer profitable.Secondly, a zip archive with a copy of the installed application folder of guiminer together with files named *.exe.exe? I haven't checked but this is most likely a trojan/virus. Would there be any drawbacks to implementing nodes so that they would relay transactions they've seen before, with the only addition of extra inputs? I.e the exact same transaction but with an extra fee. Unless there's risk of blockchain spam, DoS attacks or something like that, that would be a great feature to have IMHO. The Chinese are currently buying at above the equivalent of $1100... Rekommenderar att du skickar PM eller i alla fall tar det i en relevant tråd..
I've stayed there, it was ok but nothing special, maybe because I stayed at Kempinski before moving there..  Didn't see this thread before, I'm in for sure  Yes, but not cheaply There is a parking garage right across the street, I think that is 80 SEK/hour, or you can find a spot on a nearby street, which I think is about 15-20 SEK/hour. Priset bestäms tillsammans av köpare och säljare.  Du handlar med privatpersoner som dig själv. En del spekulerar på kursen, andra köper/säljer för att de behöver bitcoin/kronor för att köpa något, och en del vill tjäna några procent på själva växlingen.Själv hör jag till den senare kategorin.Vet inte vad du menar med kick-back.Se tråd om Satoshi Square Stockholm: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=319725.0 Vi kör idag igen, kl 17, och även nästa måndag. Jag tyckte det gick bra, var ganska mycket folk.Jag kom runt kl 18, då var det en del som var på väg därifrån och ett par kom efter det, så det var lite omsättning på folk hela tiden som det var tänkt.Stället var helt ok, risken är att det blir dåligt med sittplatser om det kommer fler i framtiden, men som jag uppfattade det fortsätter vi på samma ställe samma tid nästa måndag. Ok, jag tar bilen in så väntar lite till köerna släppt.. Jag definierar inte 2 btc som en större summa :pOch nej, man tar inte med sig en stor bunt cash, men man kan göra upp dealen på plats och lösa det senare. När du hittat det får vi köra en bitcoinmiddag där som vi pratade om  Jag kommer dit, vet inte exakt tid.Tror dock att det kan vara dumt att trada för stora summor på plats.. men allt går att lösa. Yeah but if you just go to members and click "Date registered" to sort the list, satoshis account has always been showing up on the top before, now it doesn't. If anyone want to buy an account and think it would be cool to be listed on the front page, make me an offer :pI agree with the quote though, I wouldn't recommend anyone to do it. You are making accounts showing up on the first page when sorting by registration date seem less cool Edit: ehm where is satoshi, not showing up in that list?

COMUSDINBTC . COM...And many more, check it out! Maybe now is a good time to make this a priority... En vanlig scam är att någon, kalla denna för person A, kontaktar person B och vill köpa bitcoin för banköverföring.A går med på detta om det är ok att bitcoinsen skickas efter att pengarna kommit in på kontot. A ger sitt bankkontonummer till B.B kontaktar nu person C, och säger att han vill sälja bitcoin för banköverföring. B ger A's kontonummer till C, som skickar pengar till A.A ser pengarna, och skickar bitcoin till C, som nu fått gratis bitcoin.Detta är väldigt vanligt, jag får liknande erbjudanden i princip varje vecka, gick på det första gången.(Jag säger inte att TS skulle vara person B nu, detta är menat som en varning till folk som tror att det är säkert bara för att man får pengarna till kontot först). Det kontrolleras väl antagligen på samma sätt som i Sverige; får du in en större summa pengar på banken så är det farligt att inte ta upp den i inkomstdeklarationen. Skriver du att du gjort bitcoinaffärer med vinst beskattas det enligt gällande regler. Bra Mats För er som inte var med förra året, så var det väldigt bra.Jag gillade upplägget, mer avslappnat och fler får komma till tals än om man bara har föreläsare. Just a note about the "5500 BTC bounty".According to how I've always understood the original thread, those 5500 BTC is how much the forum/Theymos owns, i.e. the maximum available for new investements. That does not mean that the final price will be 5500, especially not now when the value is a lot higher. I hope you don't imply that all of those were promoting him and/or ran a pass-though..
And if you look directly in the directory, there's even a torrent. This should be seeded I think.http://ia800904.us.archive.org/35/items/gov.uscourts.txed.146063/Also, the blacked out info in the 5.1 file can be recovered with a good pdf editor. It said something about repatriation in one of the docs, where they mentioned asset freezing.. Hmm did someone post this already?http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2013/comp-pr2013-132.pdf Yes, twice.. Updated the topic: one more Avalon auction. Why would anyone want that? Trying to figure out how hash sha256? Try setting the clock frequency to auto and the fanspeed to a lower fixed value, might work depending on ambient temp etc. I put a strip of tape on both sides of the "nuts" or whatever they are to hold them in place, worked great. I tried to do it without first too, it's not fun when the last one falls in.. No, they are all the same, but sound pressure adds up like 1 + 1 = 1.1 da wut ? Update 2013-07-16:Ok, here we go again.I once more have an Avalon for sale. Same specs as the former auction below.Just to make things easier, when bidding, state if you or I should pay the shipping and escrow fee, so I can compare the bids.The winning bid was 150 for the last one, but a couple of higher (160) bids also came in after the deal was closed, so let's see what these are worth now just a few days later.Keep in mind that people are working on these all the time, firmware, settings etc. There are water blocks coming, how high can they go with watercooling, 450 mhz / 100 GH?Oh, and the (northern hemisphere) summer will turn into autumn soon enough, imagine the cozyness of having an Avalon warming your feet instead of slippers Also, I'm looking to get rid of this ASAP, preferably sending it out before the weekend.I noticed people are adding pictures, I've been thinking that everyone know what an Avalon looks like, but do you know how an Avalon pile looks?My balcony: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/31pxydp6cf3um1p/-5vxTAY2pn#/Bid list:[private] - July 16 - 130 BTC - sold & shipped[private] - July 16 - 125 BTCOk, so I have received my 6 units of batch #2 Avalons, sold 5 and the last one is hashing away at ~82-83 GH (stable for 2 weeks now).It is currently making about 2.16 BTC/day (based on real pool payout after fees, for the last 10 days).I am however looking to sell it, hand-in-hand in Stockholm or escrowed and sent by DHL express ASAP after the deal. 1 unit is making as much noise as 6 I have a couple of bids already, but of course I want to sell as high as possible. Bids in BTC, public in thread, PM or Skype is fine.Payment by BTC or cash in hand (or possibly some other solution if you're swedish).Bid list:WEB slicer - July 8 - 160 BTC - bid received after closed dealWEB slicer - July 8 - 157 BTC - bid received after closed deal[private] - July 7 - 150 BTC, winning bid[private] - July 7 - 145 BTC[private] - July 6 - 142 BTC[private] - July 6 - 141 BTC[private] - July 4 - 140 BTC[private] - July 6 - 130 BTC[private] - July 6 - 110 BTCWEB slicer - July 7 - 100 BTCEb0la - July 6 - 35 BTCTad3j - July 6 - paying with personal advice (estimated BTC value: 0 BTC)Update:I'm adding bids to the list above as soon as I get them.I will choose a buyer tonight (Swedish time, GMT+2) based on highest price after my costs (unless stated in the bid offer, I'm assuming I'm paying shipping and buyer paying the escrow fee).Update:I have agreed on a deal, thanks for shown interest. Removed Ok, I understand. Where are you located? Shipping from china to USA is 3-4 days after DHL get the package, I assume Sweden->wherever is similar.I've got an idea, PM'ing you now.. Yeah +1, this is exciting.Btw what order # did you have? I have 2 at least, maybe more if I get good prices.I will add your bid to the list. 130 is a bit low for me now though. Hmm sees like the thread didn't bump when I edited post #1.For people who only read ends of threads; I updated the first post. Here's some kind of evidence units are currently shipping anyway: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=206895.0 What is the problem with hanewin? Looking quickly at the code it doesn't seem to contain anything that is not cross browser/platform.Otherwise you have openPGP.js, and they also link to a few other solutions here: https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/wiki/Introduction Oh, sorry about that, I was wrong.I had to read the source to believe you, accounts should really be explained better, and sendfromaccount isn't a very good name then.For the OP: Ok, so the only way to do it with bitcoin-qt is to do something like this:Run listunspent, choose the outputs you want as inputs, do createrawtransaction, signrawtransaction, sendrawtransaction. Make sure you don't forget about fee or change.There are scripts that can do this for you.Or just export the private keys and use something like brainwallet.org if it's a one time thing you need to do. Yes, you can do it with bitcoin-qt, but not through the GUI.Just create an unique label for the address you want to send from and runCode:bitcoind sendfrom <fromaccount> <tobitcoinaddress> <amount> [minconf=1] [comment] [comment-to] You only need to run the batch file if you don't have a bios capable of (U)EFI booting.. if you have a new laptop it will probably work by just copying the files to the stick.
I like both Tails and Liberté Linux, the latter is my current choice since it supports UEFI booting. I also tried calling them on some of the other numbers on both Friday and Saturday:+46 8-28 18 53 - phone company message - "number not in use"+46 76-170 50 40 - call disconnects immediately+46 72-178 73 60 - phone company message - "it is hard to get through right now"+46 72-333 34 08 - voicemail - "welcome to kncminer - we can't take your call right now, but please leave a message"I was thinking about visiting Andreas' house, but decided it would be better to at least speak to someone on the phone first. I live within walking distance from Andreas Kennemar's house (house at google maps / company address)), could easily check it out. Ok, I added a list of bids in the first post, I will update it if new bids come in, if for some reason something happens with the deal-in-progress. A question for bitstamp if you have time to read here now  :When depositing via SEPA, do you manually add the funds to the account or is it automatic?Just trying to estimate if there will be any delays. Another bid at 125 - deal basically done. I have received a few private offers:90 BTC - 1 bid100 BTC - 1 bid115 BTC - 1 bid120 BTC - 1 bidRegarding escrow, that is no problem, but the buyer would of course have to take the risk of the manufacturer not delivering at all, so the escrow would have to be time limited until the Avalon is either shipped or a confirmed scam from the manufacturer. If I had the unit at my disposal right now I would of course not sell it.Also, I have actually ordered a few of these, so for the right price I might be willing to sell more than one. Update: New batch #2 orders for sale!I'm bumping this thread because I am now considering selling one or a few of my own Avalon orders. (I was selling the last one for my friend).I will contact those of you who have bid before and to check if your bids still stand. New bidders are welcome too of course. =)The orders I'm selling now are still batch #2, but not included in the first 20 ones which according to word on the forums have now received tracking numbers.Orders will be escrowed, but the buyer takes the risk of Avalon not delivering at all.New bids:2013-05-16 - 150 BTC - PM bid2013-05-17 - 130 BTC - mgio2013-05-17 - 160 BTC - Skype2013-05-17 - 120 BTC - PM(old) Bids:2013-04-10 - 90 BTC - 1 bid (PM)2013-04-10 - 100 BTC - 2 bids (PM, HUSTLER)2013-04-10 - 115 BTC - 1 bid (PM)2013-04-10 - 120 BTC - 1 bid (PM)2013-04-10 - 125 BTC - 1 bid (PM)2013-04-10 - 126 BTC - 1 bid (PM)2013-04-11 - 127 BTC - 1 bid (PM)2013-04-12 - 150 BTC - 1 bid (Sothh)2013-04-12 - 155 BTC - 1 bid (PM)2013-04-19 - 156 BTC - 1 bid (PM)2013-04-20 - 175 BTC - 1 bid (PM)2013-04-18 - 200 BTC - 1 bid (PM)2013-04-19 - 205 BTC - 1 bid (PM)(I removed the old offer) Ok, since I now get more than 1 request for cracking wallets every day, I'd like to put it a little note here:If you contact me having forgotten your password, which is "somewhere between 1-32 characters, mixed case including numbers and special characters", please, there is no chance, and you probably stole the wallet anyway, or you would have known more.To get an idea of the chance of success, try to make a rough estimate of the number of possible combinations your info about the password will result in. If this is more than one million, I will not waste my time.As an example, the maximum complexity is like 6 unknown digits, or 4-5 unknown letters.Conclusion: raw bruteforce is not feasible, what needs to be done is educated guesses, so unless you have a very good idea of what the password might be, and probably just typed it in wrongly twice when setting it, there is a high risk of never getting that wallet open.Some types of requests I have been able to find passwords for:"The password might be any of these 6 different 20+ character passwords i regularly use, possibly with a combination of two random double letters at the end, like passwordxxyy"."I'm sure I typed in this 50 character password, but it just isn't working"."My passwords always starts with the date I created the account, in format mm.dd.yyyy, and then a clockwise or anti-clockwise circle of keys on the keyboard around some key, and then that key 10 times at the end, like 11.12.2012dertgbvcffffffffff. I know it was created sometime in November or December."That should give you an idea of what is possible. Hey psy are you also doing matching deposits, would be nice I'm only on 38%, so need to speed it up a bit =) Ok, an update:The guy I was referring to did not use wifi when logging in to instawallet at the time the site was accessed to get the qr-code and bitcoins were transferred there, since that event took place in my car.He could of course have checked in between that and the time the bitcoins disappeared.Yeah, it's a possibility that he first tried to connect via http and then got redirected to https, then it could have been someone at the mobile provider.I sent him a link to this thread, and got a reply that "it somehow sorted itself out, not sure how", so this indicates that maybe the error was between the chair and keyboard this time (or chair and phone).davout, if you're interested and want to look into it I could PM you the tx info. This just happened to a friend of mine too, a substantial amount of bitcoins lost from an instawallet account a few hours after sending them there.The only device used to access instawallet was an iphone that he had control over at all times between first accessing the account and the theft, so there is only two possibilities here:There is an iphone wallet stealer trojan or similar in the wild.Instawallet was hacked or the theft was internal.My advice is to not use this kind of service, use something where only you can control the private keys to eliminate one risk factor.If you need to use instawallet or similar services, send the coin somewhere more secure as fast as possible. Oh, and to people not knowing how to check PGP signatures or that someone is authed in IRC:Don't trade on #bitcoin-otc ! You don't have the necessary knowledge to keep yourself from getting scammed. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1****A guy on skype told me.No, my name is not Mathew Harrison.I've now added this link to all my #bitcoin-otc orders: http://pastebin.com/u/riX2000This post is signed with both my otc-registered bitcoin address and PGP key.****Bitcoin signature (text beginning and ending with *****):Hw49okBTCOXsrsJfqIUFmM0OraDNWEUpQptm5UomlWpysqjdIZKdKBuYwEI0DEnvJqgZacHeTM8mQRY FbxjuYaE=-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJRMmjgAAoJEJ8xgCx5ZC8lEQ0H/100C8oROOfIyCzIjSbcg+hAChH9wl/FHfmo9E63U+MYAoYga9FuFk7DrUAt1hZEIMbpxbVoo//kGKFsdpsZ9E06WxyowCNJj05zD1SpjKB2QE8TPhfMEC2IBLdl8qqhxPaqM5iBSfIWIWSxoa5jUddk5awgrQsu3S1yYVwWg/4LFJ4/59H4+ijTTyrwz0IXFnO9CNAQc4vSbaGAlnAqKh7vkbtPRWqQibrIlFFm69W/AYhKXJCDGbwhLLAcx/9hg1/g2pqXjyaOgY/W7HdPf3gi57eEvTLxbXJtdNrq/Bxmm8agM5C71lX94h9xneabU6dgc/6R9SnPIAT4OIpRhyw==eFNZ-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- My account is very much not dormant =) Well, just wanted to say that I'm riX2000 at #bitcoin-otc, and there's been a few cases that I know of when people have been scammed.Some idiot is claiming to be me, sending out links to my otc ratings, and people are buying it without confirming that the email address is correct, not checking that the guy is authed on IRC, not asking for PGP or bitcoin signature etc.I'm going to add a link in my otc-orders to a text telling people to be more careful and verify the identity of the anyone claiming to be me. It might help someone, but careless or stupid people will always exist.I will never fail to send a PGP or bitcoin signed message, and my email is written in the comments of all my #otc orders. Why?The information in the thread is not outdated, and splitting or creating a new thread for someone having the same issue months later would just create a lot of threads where the same information is repeated.I get PM's about this thread several times every month, and have helped some people recover their wallets. Why did I get a "bitcointalk personal message notification" from matthew sent to an email-address not registered here, and no pm in my inbox?Matthew, send that PM again if it was you, otherwise I will treat it as spam. Ok, I don't know, it's probably true.But it might be worth checking anyway unless you're sure, it should not really be any more unsafe to just encrypt the original change addresses, since the ones used in transactions are saved.  unless you did 100+ transactions the change address should be in the unencrypted wallet.
Great, thanks for that info. Did he have a Texas ip? Or Thai? I'm more interested in asset info than liabilities at this moment.That is actually interesting, I'd guess the likelihood of a number being turned off at all times would increase if it belonged to someone a lot of angry people were constantly trying to contact. Yeah, something like that. I basically don't know any cafés or anything in that neighbourhood, so your suggestion sounds good to me. Yes, it's a common name, but my above post was meant as a step-by-step instruction on how to narrow it down to two names.. If he doesn't hide his ip he probably doesn't hide his phone number. No, I don't think all the coins are returned either, I probably would have known. I got all my approx. 0.5 BTC back though. It's not just about the coins, it's about the asset info.

Or even easier: let people download their trade history csv-files from glbse.com, just add a PGP or bitcoin address signature to it.The csv functionality is already implemented, I have my csv but no way to prove to issuers that it's not manipulated. Jag säger de engelska orden, men böjer dem på svenska. Jag säger alltså "miner", "minade", "minat" osv.Detta gäller även andra engelska ord som t.ex "e-mail", "hacker" osv. i stället för de försvenskade "e-post" och "hackare" som jag inte tycker låter bra. Yeah, I'd be interested in a meet-up.Now we just have to find a good place to be, of course some bar or restaurant might do, but if we could find somewhere a bit more private that I think that could be better.Do you Finnish guys have any other plans for the day?And to DeaDTerra, it's November 25th  This affects me in the way that I'm now aware of one of the unwritten rules which might get me banned if I don't follow it.If you think that suggesting forum improvements is a sign of me wanting to quit being here, maybe this place is to intellectual for you, and you should hang more on those other 9 forums you have accounts with.You wouldn't have to state the exact reason, just that something like "user x is banned for y days for breaking rule 4.1".If users don't know the rules, it's impossible to follow them.The same rules should apply to everyone, and in my opinion there are both people who deserve to be banned both more and less than goat, if the ban reason was "He wasn't discussing anything anymore, just restating the same points over and over." I'm not against banning people in general, but I think there should be predefined forum rules, and all bans or other actions should be according to those.Also, when a ban is set, the responsible mod/admin should post stating that he banned some user and which rule was broken.One rule could definitely be "All posts should have content of high quality." (I don't know if this applies to goat).
Or export the private key and use another client that doesn't need to download the blockchain.. like brainwallet.org or something.If it's better than re-downloading the blockchain depends on how easily you learn stuff. Svenskar kan engelska.. Yeah, it seems like DDoSing sites and blackmailing them for bitcoin seems to be some idiots new business idea.(Not that I know if Bitstamp has been blackmailed, but others have).EDIT: http://bitcoinmagazine.net/bitstamp-under-ddos/ - idiots indeed, and 75 BTC can buy a couple of months DDoS protection Bitstamp has been down for some hours now, planned maintenance or what's happening? Anyone sending in copies of their passport should add some text in front of the picture, like a big red "for GLBSE use only" or something.. Then it will be harder for anyone to use it for illegitimate purposes if they get stolen by "hackers" or whatever.Example: http://bayimg.com/CADNCaaeN +10That was the best post I've read today, totally agree. Yeah, we also need troll-tag and FUDster tag. Multiply every payout with [his deposit excluding paid out interest]/[his payout].

Arriving late friday so will probably only attend saturday+sunday. Då ses vi om några timmar då  Good initiative, but you could elaborate and link to some more info, this looks like a hack.. I'd like it to go to something that most mainstream people would appreciate, like medical research or similar. The most important for me is that it is accompanied with lots of positive media attention. Ett tips är ju att boka nu, flyg osv. är billigare om man bokar tidigt. Update: the SMS check started working, I had to buy something first, just loading the card seems to not have activated the balance check function. It takes almost an hour to get an answer though. Sure, I've got tickets, I just hope the people who are angry about bitcoinica doesn't try to ruin it.. A question about the pekao card: I'm having problems with the SMS balance check, I'm not getting any reply. Is it working for anyone else? (Outside Poland).DeanC: I'm not in need of cards right now, I'll get back to you when I am.
I had 776.56 and then the next day it was 776.48. Might be some fee, but I'm sure I didn't buy anything. I haven't compared it with the EURPLN exchange rate but what else could it be? I have noticed that bzwbk keeps the deposit in PLN even if it's a EUR card, since the balance varies even if there is no transactions.. Jag har biljett, kommer fredag kväll och åker söndag kväll. Tar med mig flickvännen också, men vet inte om hon kommer vilja vara med på konferensen eller shoppa =) Fixade en biljett till henne iaf. Do you have any more info about this? Were you able to withdraw anything at all at first? What did the bank tell you when you contacted them? Yes of course, so don't be verified if you want anonymity.. If you plan on doing stuff worse than tax evasion, you need more precautions than these cards. You load them from a bitcoin exchange site.. The deal is not to be 100% anonymous and untraceable, it is that getting sums of money into your personal bank account will alert the bank. Yeah, let's all install Lynx. Definitely easier.Or to be honest, paypal might be as easy, but I don't use them more than absolutely necessary out of principle. +1^(my first +1 ever)Let's just have a nice conference, I don't want to be disturbed by someones butt hurt whether it's justified or not, choose another time and place for that. Order more than one card.. I'm getting my eight soon 1,7 btc ~= 15 EUR just now, that equals 0,6% of 2500 EUR. You won't finder cheaper rates anywhere now. Heh, no, it just changes some table styles to white backgrounds =) Just an ugly hack, the turqoise/blue color it gets over rdp is not looking very work related This is it for now:Code:// ==UserScript==// @name        bitcointalk minifyer// @namespace   blah// @include     https://bitcointalk.org/*// @version     1// ==/UserScript==if(document.documentElement.innerHTML.indexOf('<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=pm">My Messages [<strong>1</strong>]</a>')!=-1){ if(confirm("New PM, view?")){  document.location.href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=pm"; }}if(document.location.href.indexOf("action=pm")!=-1){ document.getElementById("outbox").checked=true;}if(( document.location.href.indexOf("topic=")!=-1 || document.location.href.indexOf("action=watchlist")!=-1 || document.location.href.indexOf("action=unread")!=-1)&&document.location.href.indexOf("action=post")==-1){ var datrs = document.getElementsByTagName('tr'); for(i=0;i<datrs.length;i++){  if(datrs[i].innerHTML.indexOf('class="maintab')==-1){   //datrs[i].innerHTML=datrs[i].innerHTML.replace(<td colspan="2" width="10%">&nbsp;</td>','');   datrs[i].innerHTML=datrs[i].innerHTML.replace(/<td[^>]*>&nbsp;<\/td>/g,'');   //datrs[i].innerHTML=datrs[i].innerHTML.replace('<td colspan="2" class="catbg3" width="9%"></td>','');   datrs[i].innerHTML=datrs[i].innerHTML.replace(/<td[^>]*><\/td>/g,'');  }   var innertds=datrs[i].getElementsByTagName('td');  if(innertds.length==7){   datrs[i].removeChild(innertds[0]);   datrs[i].removeChild(innertds[0]);   dabr=innertds[4].getElementsByTagName('br');   if(dabr.length>0) dabr[0].parentNode.removeChild(dabr[0]);   for(j=0;j<innertds.length;j++){    innertds[j].className="calendar_today";//White_bg   }  } }}And to everyone using this: make sure I didn't put a password stealer in there..  edit: sorry, just changed something before posting, fixed some bug I already have something like this in a greasemonkey script. I also changed the colors so it looks nice over remote desktop (16-bit).Also, it looks a lot nicer if you remove the linefeed in the rightmost column in the thread list (between post time and nick). Yes, you get an IBAN number. You can send from your bank or most exchanges. So are you saying I could get a pesel anonymously for registering? Otherwise I don't understand your point, I can get a card with no fees at all from my bank at home if I show id.. As I told you in PM, being able to use the card online and in stores makes 500 PLN/tx a bit low. You need a PESEL number... You have millions of bitcoins in deposits!??!!?!?! PONZI FOR SURE!!one1 OMG This is the final proof!!</sarcasm> Just for fun: create tables of criminals statistics for sweden: http://statistik.bra.se/solwebb/action/indexKillings by gun 2011 (per 100 000):  <0.5  (margin of error 0.5)Killings by any means 2011 (per 100 000): 2   (margin of error 0.5)I've personally never seen a handgun, except in military service and the ones the police are carrying. I never seen a drawn gun ever, except in shooting ranges.Last year Swedish customs seized 20 illegals guns, a huge increase compared to earlier years, leading to new laws. Original Poster, aka. TS aka. Thread-Starter. I got an unopened envelope directly from the bank.. ordered through one of the top google results..
These cards have been sold online for $19.99USD for a long time.. just google.Also, you can even order them from the bank itself if you use google translate... 15 PLN each. Varför tror du det? Pga. bitcoin? Såg klart på hela, men mer för att träna på danska, stängde nästan av när kamerakvinnan(?) skulle försöka filma skärmen under den sista biten..Sen fick man tyvärr intrycket att det var krångligare än det behöver vara, jag tror att någon typ av manus eller planering hade varit bra om man vill få fram ett tydligt budskap. I'm in too, interesting to see if some random person trusts me.Same as the 1-btc-circle, 155gBnpiBQcpnP6coTX6V7znSK3G73uNjK Right..

Just claim they were mined two years ago.Of course, everything depends on blockchain analysis not holding up in court. From the outside it looks like Mr A sold bitcoins to Mr P. If authorities ask, Mr A says he mined them. Borrowing a lot of btc enables you to create your own btc tumbler, efficient enough that a blockchain analysis never holds up in court. Early adopters might have some coin unused since they were mined, check out the blockchain for interesting stuff.. Tldrifyed: An individual of profession, in order of probable probability, live poker player, carpenter doing some business on the side on weekends, drug dealer or bank robber, has got too much physical cash, and wants to convert his pile into a more legal form, preferably in the bank account of his legitimate business or possibly offshore. He makes a transaction with Mr P, who in turn makes a note in his books about selling bitcoins OTC to an unnamed customer, since KYC requirements is not needed for transactions not involving currency conversion, and btc is not currency as we all know. That the three letter requirement is unneeded is of course in the grey zone, but that's why he's hired a lawyer, making sure not to break any rules, just bend them. As soon as the cash is in the bank, a wire is sent to the individual, aka. Mr A, with the aforementioned profession's tax-paying account, and pays with the very same bitcoins that he bought before, getting a nice sum of about 90% of the former deal. The remaining 10% of the cash goes to mtgox and is swiftly converted into btc. A's got fresh smelling money in the bank, for which he payed 10%, and can now buy cars ans houses. P's got 10% more BTC. The market's got some less BTC, equivalent to 10 and not 100% of the total operation, which is convenient, since it is then easy when holding ten times that to put up a few walls of another kind than those Mr A crafts on weekends to stabilize the rate and not risk too much during the few hours he's in fiat. With P's background as CEO of TLP, Mr O's tool slides right off the stubble. I'm working as an estimator / project manager / designer in civil engineering, more specific post tensioned concrete, mostly for bridges, and also bridge bearings and expansion joints. Extra char..  Did we just see that cup+handle?http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg2zig1-minztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv No, but that's ok, I told him I didn't need any reward. Unless he's got several wallets I would have taken a substantial amount of his coins to increase my holdings with a fraction of a percent.. I cracked it.. Revalins code up above would have done it in an hour..EDIT: Don't know if OP was impressed though, haven't heard from him, no reply to the PM where I sent him the right pwd. He transferred the bitcoins to a new address, except the 0.1 BTC I stole when testing (hope you're not angry about that 1zbtc, I'll give it back if you want ) He had indeed mistyped the password, but I cracked it.. 52 char pwds are not always good, easy to mistype =)
Problem solved...   I'm not really a newbie anymore, so I'll just let the link to my public key sit in my signature.. If you're thinking about coordinating the nonce with other users to not calculate the same hashes, it is not needed, since you have different block data (the address the reward is payed out to). aHR0cDovL2FyY2hpdmUuYmxpc3N0cmVlLmNvbS9maWxlcy8yMDA5LzEwL2xpbmR0X3NlYV9zYWx0XzI uanBn SXQgaXMsIEkgbGlrZSBpdCBiZXR0ZXIgdGhhbiB0aGUgbmV3IG9yYW5nZSBvbmUgdGhvdWdoLg== Sorry to say, but I just found out that we have some really twisted tolls on stuff from outside the EU..

Troligen har jag det. Intressant, jag kontaktade skatteverket för ca ett år sedan, de var då totalt clueless. Vore kul att få mer info om du har det.Jag svarade med en lång wall-of-text som förklarade hur dumma de var, fick inget svar.Det som vore mest intressant är om någon har info om hur mining och värdeökning på köpta / minade bitcoins beskattas. Det mest rätta vore ju om värdeökningen beskattades som inkomst av kapital, och miningen på samma sätt som t.ex produktion av elektricitet.Som det är nu vågar man ju inte skriva något i deklarationen.. slipper ju sjävklart helst skatt öht., men ibland är det ju bra med "vita" pengar också..Ontopic, det finns nog ingen jurist som kan ge ett vettigt svar, man bör vända sig till Finansinspektionen eller Skatteverket, egentligen krävs det nog en dom man kan ha som prejudikat innan det kan ges något definitivt svar.Finansinspektionens sida har dock en del info om vilka tillstånd som behövs i allmänhet för finansiell verksamhet.

questions:Are they refillable?What name will there be on the card?Can they be used in ATMs, if so, what are the fees.Are there any other fees? What about using the cards in countries with other currencies?What info will you be needing for orders? It would be cool to have registration date under the avatar =)I'll send 1 btc to anyone replying to this post within 10 minutes using an older account than mine  Using firefox:go to PM inbox (tab1)open new tab with bitcointalk (tab2)logout in tab 2go to tab 1, refresh pageyou'll see warning+password prompt in tab 1login again in tab 2go back to tab 1, clock "home" linkwatch url field, it will include PHPSESSID=aabbccddee112233445566778899Feels like a potential security risk to me, might be hard to exploit but anyway...Also, can anyone reproduce this, I've only tried on one computer, otherwise it might not be a problem. I wouldn't call it a scam, some people might like to have someone to talk to rather than finding the information themselves.Imagine someone not very used to computers, not many here probably, but anyways. Did you sell it? I noticed it was removed from craigslist.If you do sell it for bitcoins, it would be cool if you could make a video of the transaction or something, might have enough publicity value for your bitcoins to get worth even more =).
I'm interested, do I qualify as reputable?What time frame did you have in mind? You might want to reorder that to make it find adjacent _keys_ on the keyboard, not adjacent letters in the alphabet.Edit: noticed you posted that just before..When I get home from work I can post my script unless you have it figured out by then. I did the same thing two weeks ago, mistyped my 30-char pwd twice, although that was on a 7-zip archive.I made a script that tried all combinations of the keyboard keys surrounding the ones that should be correct, and also upper/lower case combinations for the characters that were adjacent to those that were supposed to be capitals.Found the password in about 3 secs...I have the script, but it's for 7-zip, but it's not hard to fix.. PM'ed you..I want to buy something on my wish list. Where I am they sell for the equivalent of about USD 250-300 depending on number of controllers and games. Price?Where are you located?Do you ship everywhere?  In the future it will be possible to search for photos with the same person in it on the internet using face recognition, the technology exists, an example is picasa.I wouldn't trust anyone just because I've seen their photo.The same functionality can be had with current PGP-based trust-rings, just have someone sign their photo file.The question is, how would you know that the photo is not of someone else? You'll need additional information for that. I'm more interested in a more detailed description, the actual code is not important.Something on the same level as the pdf Satoshi relesed in the beginning of bitcoin. Isn't it obvious from the links I posted? Look at the screenshot, says he sent 50.01 and 400.08 to 1pV8bUCuvJcPP6CaFLuyCLuuLHVha5F2i, those transactions don't exist. Well, the screenshot in his signature is fake...

I'd love to see registration dates under peoples avatars, that alone might be enough to prevent some people from creating new accounts.(And of course it would look nice if you registered early on..

If someone is still interested in buying BTC through western union using the method in post #7 I am prepared to sell up to about $15,000 USD worth.We will have to agree on the rate. Applied physics and electrical engineering, then I changed my mind and started studying civil engineering, which is what I currently work with. if you do a whois search on mybitcoin.com you'll see that the server was hosted at leaseweb.Someone should contact them to try end get some contact info or at least tell them to make a backup of the logs, an dpossibly the database if people need proof later on. That's the impression I've got as well, although I remember thinking there were a few things that got too shallow a introduction, but didn't reflect on it further then because I wasn't even aware that Ringworld was part of a series when I read it.But whatever, now I've started on the Ringworld Engineers anyway - it's supposed to be the best one.
I just got my Amazon Kindle DX I bought for Bitcoins today! (Got it through http://spendbitcoins.com/ - great site).So, now I'm deciding which book to start with. I read Niven's Ringworld last year, so I was thinking I'd go with the next in the series (The Ringworld Engineers), but when I looked it up at Wikipedia I noticed that there is more than 10 earlier books taking place in Known Space.Did anyone here read them all or even a few? Basically I'm asking if reading the entire Known Space series first will add anything significant to the story of the Ringworld series.I'm hoping you'll tell me to just go ahead and read the Ringworld Engineers, but on the other hand I don't want to miss out on something either...My second choice is something else entirely - Santa Olivia by Jacqueline Carey (since I liked the Kushiel series a lot). No, since the transactions are stored in the blockchain and not in the wallet.dat file, there is no need to have the bitcoin client running to receive transactions.To learn more about how the protocol works etc., check out the wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page I bought something through spendbitcoin.com recently - it went really smoothly, and it was almost easier than buying something with my credit card, since I didn't have to fill in the card number and stuff. +1 posts does not add any valuable information to the forum imho. The question is whether we want this to be a place to chat or a place to get information easily.And to comment on the topic: great decision, if people want unquestioned freedom of speech we can create a subforum for that. It's up for me now. I'd need more like 50 btc to write up an article like that.For OP: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=live+cd+tftp There is a law stating that the central bank (Riksbanken) is the only one that has the right to issue banknotes and coins (Art. 14 @ http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_PageExtended____6326.aspx).An unofficial translation of "The Sveriges Riksbank Act (1988:1385)" is available at http://www.riksbank.se/upload/Dokument_riksbank/Kat_publicerat/Broschyrer/riksbankslagen_2003.pdf.There is a law regulating the issuance of electronic currency (https://lagen.nu/2002:149), but the definition there does not apply to bitcoin.An interesting side note is the following quote:This is a big difference between the e.g. the U.S. central bank and the Swedish. I don't know how the Czech national bank works. Which existing law would that be? Please link - the entire Swedish law can be read at https://lagen.nu.I'm not aware of any micropayment option shut down in Sweden. There's no way it will be banned (here) in Sweden, our legal system does not work like thatThe article linked is published in Aftonbladet, which is the largest newspaper in Sweden, but are known to exaggerate and sometimes even make stuff up, in my opinion more so than others. Or you could use any linux (or windows) live cd which you load into ram when booting. You just have to modify it with miner software etc before. There are more than one client, pick one or make your own with custom rules.If you change the limit of total bitcoins in your client, and also includes mining software, you would effectively create a fork of the blockchain. Well, it has a few advantages over the alternatives, which combined with being potentially unstoppable gives bitcoin potential to get very popular.You also have to take into account that if it becomes a significant choice for storing value, the value will be based on the fraction that's circulating and not 21 million. If I remember correctly I actually got about 500-600 khash/s on my desk computer, and something like 250 on my laptop. (In like jan/feb 2010).Of course, I regret not mining and buying more early on, but I think I'll be pretty well off in a few years anyway.. Bill Gates level is fine for me, I don't need a small countrys GDP to have fun in life ;P No, the same as the one that's included in the official client.The reason for not mining would be turning off computer at night, not wanting to waste cpu, forgetting to start bitcoin after reboot etc. Since they were worth practically nothing the incentive for generating coins were low.I generated for a short time when I first discovered bitcoin, but then I forgot about it for some months, and never started generating again, since getting maybe one block every few days was not as fun as getting 5-10 a day. http://bitcoin.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bitcoin/trunk/main.cpp?view=markup&pathrev=1Line 2213.Looks the same.I know at least 10 people who were using bitcoin in early 2009, but I'm not sure all were generating. Storing you keys safely are trivial as shown previously, just make sure not to decrypt them somewhere and not wipe that space thoroughly afterwards.A bigger problem is how to store keys safely while you are healthy, but what if you get in a car accident and loose your memory or worse?How do you store the keys so you and no one else will be able to use them even if you have forgotten the password?And how to make sure the ones you want to have your coins (and other secret stuff) when you are not longer able to use a computer?DataMatrix Tattoo on inner thigh? -maybe some coroner gets lucky.Secret printed note with password at home? -maybe, what if the cause of your memory loss or death is a fire at home?etc..If someone has a good solution to this, I'd appreciate to hear it. cheaper than you..     It would work, but you would have to implement the functionality in the client. Back to topic: I'd sell about 10% of my holdings at 50 USD, unless it was the dollar that dropped. Some people might call that "a large amount". I have the SE Xperia Arc, I like it, and it's thin enough to have in tight jeans pockets.
Do a forum search for fpga, read all the threads. Does it make a difference? Seems like the effect would be limited, since the air would be moving pretty good thanks to the fans on the GPUs anyway. Of course, there will always be unfairness independent of which system that is used.This is because it's impossible to satisfy every persons needs. The most common solution to this is to choose the solution that makes the most people get what they want. I did not say that what I proposed was optimal, but it is way better, in my opinion, to makes the most people get what they want weighted by how much they have thought through their decision, than just letting any idiot vote on issues that are way above his head.I won't go into the discussion about banning all potential hazardous activities, but I just want to comment that the ban on drugs is not primarily based on the health care costs, but the fact that even if drugs were legal, a lot of crimes would still be drug related.It should be. The best answers to questions are what society need. Voting is excercise of power, but the problem is that the amount of power is equal between educated an non educated voters.Imagine a vote on the legality of bitcoin: Should people who have studied economics and the bitcoin system and understand it well have the same voting power as someone who have only read one single article full of wrong facts in some blog? Aldrig hängt på sweclockers.. nu för tiden kan man lätt hänga här på heltid. I agree as long as there is no secondary consequences for the democaratic community, ie. heightened, tax subventioned, healt care costs because you did something in private. That's right, they are stored in the blockchain. Bitcoins does not actually exist anywhere, the blockchain is just a bunch of transactions, starting with a generation transaction with just a receiver and no sender. Your wallet file only contain the private keys needed to sign a transaction from the corresponding bitcoin address.I suggest reading the Bitcoin white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto, the wiki and, if you'll understand it, the source code. Links at bitcoin.org. In my opinion, the biggest flaw with democracy as it is commnly defined today, is that it allows people to vote even if they are not educated about the subject. If votes were weighted by the number of correct answers on some simple test questions about the subject, we would have a much better decision process.Where I live, two very common reasons people give when asked about why the voted on some part in an election is "because I have always voted like that" and "because my parents / friends have always voted like that". You can just send more bitcoins to the vault address, you don't need the key for that. Since google translate don't like https, feel free to use this.

The problem is to make the transactions happen without trust, since you don't want to have centralized accounts. Coding the exchange is easy, that's not where the problem is.What needs to be done is two things:find at least two "currencies" to trade, which can be instantly transferred and is non-refundable.Find a way to decentralize trust, i.e. a decentralized clearing house.The answer to the first point is obviously BTC, and then we have LR, NameCoin and possibly testnet BTC.I don't know if it's worth the effort, all of those are as hard to buy food with as bitcoin.The answer to the second point is a bit more hard to come up with, and is possibly impossible to fully implement.There is two possibilities, both including tradeoffs on the decentralization or function. The first is to have a rating system. We all know how that works, so let's leave it at that.The second possibility is to do it like this:Alice have BTC, Bob have LR.Bob creates a new bitcoin address, and sends the public key to Alice.Alice uses a modified transaction to send some BTC to Bobs bitcoin address. The modifications consist of signing the transaction using both Alice's and Bob's keys in such a way that both keys are required to claim the coins. How to implement this is described here: https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=2728.0.(This will require a client with implementation of the required scripting opcodes).Now Bob can see that Alice have spent some bitcoins, and that neither of them can claim them without having both private keys.This is as good as it gets. Bob can now choose between sending Alice the LR or not sending them.She then has the choice of giving him the key, completing the transaction, or not giving him the key, forfeiting the bitcoins.The possibility of being able to make the other person lose money without any risk will make for some good trolling, so this would possibly have to be combined with a rating system anyway.There is also the possibility of using nLockTime to make the transaction expire after a certain amount of time if someone got scammed, but this is not implemented in clients. A bit off-topic, but the first was actually NewLibertyStandards exchange at newlibertystandard.wetpaint.org... More exchanges can never be bad, and I like the approach.If you open source it would be even more attractive. I don't understand it either. Maybe 500000000 is just some number inserted to show possible functionality for nLockTime, or maybe for returning the same result as 0 when people thinks nLockTime is a block number instead of a unix timestamp. Could someone post a copy of the .exe for investigation?Put it in an archive so no one accidentally runs it. The two last attacks only applies when the attacker have much more than 50%.If he has 90%, he will of course get 90% of blocks as anyone not attacking the network although having 90% should.Having 90% and not including other peoples transactions just means that they will have to wait 10 times longer for confirmations.The only attack feasible is the first one, but it gets harder and harder for every confirmation.If he has 50% of the network, he has 50% chance to reverse a transactions if he starts to reverse it immediately after it's sent. He can then continue on that fork, generating faster than all the others, making it the longest chain.However, if he waits another confirmation before starting the attack, he has to generate two blocks in the time it takes for the rest of the network to generate one, so he'll need 67% at first, which gives him 50% chance to catch up with the real chain having two more blocks, and only after succeeding to create the two attack blocks he can sustain his chain with >50%.For attacking three confirmations he'll need 75%, for four confirmations 80% etc.For n confirmations he'll need n/(n+1) of the network (n times all the others).Having x times the hashing power of the rest of the network gives him a x/(x+1) chance of succeeding.EDIT:As for generating more than 50 BTC/block, that would create a fork, no one else would include those blocks in their local blockchain. Get the IBAN number from your bank, click withdraw @ mtgox and follow the instructions. You can withdraw directly from mtgox to your bank account, your bank will automatically exchange it for the currency your account is denominated in. Check with your bank for conversion fees.What country are you in? It seems like it takes some effort to realize that these rules exist, maybe add a static link in the header or footer instead of a thread? Yeah, probably, so why don't everyone with more than a few k of bitcoins do that all the time? Morals?You also have to learn more about dark pools and how mtgox works.Most likely the transactions lulzsec linked to has nothing to do with them at all.
There's a limit fow withdrawing 1000 usd and the equivalent amount of bitcoins..Some of those transactions of 50 btc originated from generation blocks. Unless mtgox is mining that block probably didn't have anything to do with mtgox withdrawal, just some pool or solo miner moving bitcoins around.Also, if they had come from mtgox, they obviously would have come from _buying_ bitcoins, not selling them off. I sure hope so.. at 500 I'll quit my day job (probably before though). We should start looking at BigMac/BTC instead of USD/BTC.. Might become a good community, but for inclusion on Bitcoin.org, I'd personally only like to see a bit more established sites, it would get quite cluttered quickly otherwise. In my opinion, this forum are getting increasingly hard to read, mostly due to bad "netiquette".Do we need some kind of forum rules? Use this thread to discuss the pros and cons of rules and if you are in favor of them, what rules we should have?Suggestions (in order of my view of importance):The topic should reflect the content of the thread.Further discussion about existing topics should be posted in the existing thread(s).For off-topic discussion, a new thread should be created. (Occasional off-topic posts might be ok).Of course, we also have to discuss the penalties for breaking the rules; suggestions are:Timed ban from starting threads.Timed ban from posting.Account removal (for obvious troll/spam accounts, although it might never be needed, timed bans should suffice).So, do you agree? Who likes five new "BITCOIN CRASH, SELL NOW !!1!1"-threads a day?  It's calculated as new_difficulty=old_difficulty*(time it should take to create (14*24*60*60/(10*60)) blocks) / (time it really took to create (14*24*60*60/(10*60)) blocks), unless new_difficulty > old_difficulty*4 or < old_difficulty/4.See function GetNextWorkRequired in main.cpp. I'm quite sure that the number if _bitcoin_ millionaires <= 2, and never will be any higher. Dollar millionaires however.. Or just make a GUI as a front-end for bitcoind, no need to edit the original code at all, just send API commands to the daemon. Of course, but you need to be very careful to get everything right and secure.I'm sure it's not the client you don't like, but the GUI.Maybe you can change what you don't like and publish some patches for the official client. The block will be rejected if the timestamp is more than two hours in the future of less than the median of the last 11 block timestamps..https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_rules -> "block" messages -> 5, 13 I found Satoshis whitepaper while googling for something like "encrypted money" in January 2010. I had been thinking about how to create unforgeable money for some time, but probably never would have come up with the blockchain solution. People with BTC > 10k like open source stuff.. You need to give more details about the business idea. It will be pretty hard to get below $0.60 USD with FPGAs, I really had the ASIC alternative in mind for my part of the bounty, but I will of course pay it for a FPGA solution that meet all requirements. So you're saying you're still raping her?  We need more forum rules, and someone enforcing them.Those I'd like to see the most are"topic texts which correctly describes thread content""on-topic post content required"Other nice features would be "like/dislike"-buttons on posts to get rid of "+1" posts, and two types of "top posts" lists, one for threads with new posts and one for most viewed threads. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1Great initiative!

I sent you a pm.. Why don't you just make some script to get the file and parse it automatically? Sorry to hear that.Did you use pgp for your communications? The Madhatter has a very good reputation so I feel that something like this need some kind of proof, unless of course he's willing to give an explanation here. Most Swedes are too good at English for this to be profitable.. although some Swedish translation of the wiki would be nice. I'm getting the same error on Android 2.3.2, SE Experia Arc. Or maybe just Code:[B] / [S] or even Code:B: / S: Type in the amount of bitcoins you want to add. You will then get an address to send bitcoins to from you mybitcoin account.

Great idea, but as SmokeTooMuch noted, identical passphrases would generate the same keys, although this could be easily solved by appending some random string to the passphrase.I've actually printed the private key for my savings address.Built in import/export of private keys is one of the features I miss the most right now. Start the client with the -rescan switch. (Or with -? for more commands). You probably don't have all blocks downloaded yet, check your receiving address balance at http://blockexplorer.com/address/insert-your-bitcoin-address-here Or someone made a bad bot or greasemonkey script. Yes.. I notice it too. Sure, 70 incl. shipping. Better to buy a PS3 than wasting them on bad trading :/ No one will or should accept paypal from a new ,untrusted, user.Where are you located? I bid 60 if it includes shipping to Sweden. I was almost about to ask what the point was.. was looking at the wrong piece of text. That's me (see my pgp sig). I would also like to leave it open.Maybe there should be a members only section?
I've not tried the -rescan switch, but running the client from a ram disk when doing the initial block chain download speeds up the process quite a bit. Seems like there might be some inefficient disk I/O going on. If you have free electricity, you could sell it to people who want to put a mining computer at your place.. Easier than to sell your surplus electricity on the energy market, if that's even possible.. Today there was a bot online there.The bot kept adjusting it's order so to always be included in the lowest 500 USD worth of sell orders.It's easy to see if it's online. Gold price = 1430 USD/ozGold content of coin = 0.1866 ozBTCUSD = 0.9Value of gold coin = 1430 * 0.1866 / 0.9 = 296 BTCFreight might be something like 25 BTC.Current bid is 280 BTC. This was how I found it too - if we both thought of the concept of bitcoins before we knew it existed we're probably not the only ones. This is one of the strongest reasons I have for believing in this. Will send 12.5 x 4 = 50 BTC in a couple of minutes. http://www.rovaniemi.fi/Kansainvalinen_sivusto/English/Ylaosan_linkit/Feedback/FAQ.iw3 I want one too!I like the one with the ones and zeroes on the edge most, but the bottom kitten is also nice. Just curious: in which block was this transaction (6) included? The only disadvantage with the professional version is that it needs mono or .NET framework installed. If you don't have the prerequisites, looks at the differences and decide if it's worth installing them. A Swedish newspaper has arranged a chat session with Julian Assange starting 22:45 Swedish time (GMT+1), ie. now.http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article8620721.abMight get interesting. Very nice, you should make a new thread, people will miss it here. The value will always be what the market decides. If everyone trading on the market was making mathematically optimal decisions, your first assumption would be valid.This is the same reason as why salary is not equal to the amount of money needed to buy the exact amount of what you produced by working. But did you get the money originally by trading bitcoins into LR from some man on IRC?Or were you going to trade your LR into bitcoin with this man using Mt.Gox as an exchanger? Do you have sha256?   Did you deposit bitcoins or Liberty Reserve into Mt.gox? If bitcoins, from which bitcoin address? What many fail to realize is that there is only need for a wallet backup if you send bitcoins, not when you receive them.When you send some bitcoins, one or more new bitcoin adresses are created and added to your wallet, to which some additional bitcoins might get sent!As Blitzboom wrote, the wallet contains a list of 100 new addresses, so in theory you could make up to 100 transaction before this would matter.This is a feature that is specific to the official client, not to the bitcoin protocol. You could patch the client not to send anything except what you tell it. That would however reduce the anonymity and make it easier to track the flow of bitcoins through the network. I'll donate 50 BTC each to the first two people doing this if the do it on different days. If they do it on the same day they'll get 25 each.I'm assuming someone will film this.. I have a 200 USD card I bought from bitcoin2cc a while ago which I'm willing to sell...I've had it on the bitcoin-otc, but there was no interest there.I'll sell to the highest bidder, let's start at 220 bitcoins.

Ok I'm in for 1 BTC just to fill the list of voters.(Someone might have to remind me to vote/pay).. I'm using skandway.com, they charge 2.9% (min $9) for bank wire USD - LR USD. In addition to LR's 1% fee this is still lower than anything I've found.The downside is that it's a Swedish language site, and you have to be able to read Swedish to use it. (Although some translation service might do the trick). Feel free to donate to me as well.My bitcoin address is 1NXuu1q2qCy2krk18cnh6yByGsKa8cTG16 I'm in.Come on now everybody, do something with all those bitcoins you've been collecting. Whose rates are those? I have 244 Travian Gold that I am willing to trade for bitcoins. They are transferable to *.se servers only.I will edit this post if I trade them. Yes, hurry, or someone might send you bitcoins   You could, but you'd have to wait for one block to be generated between each one of them. Sweet! I've been looking for something to make some kind of semi-cloud setup, and JSON-RPC looks promising. Keep up the good work! I believe he/she refers to the fact that your formula makes the price proportional to the number of people generating, assuming a fixed energy price. Since we "know" that the total processing power available for generating bitcoins will increase over time, we also know that their value will rise, and hence should take this into account when determining the exchange rate.However, since you're currently the only one both selling and buying, I think your method is as good as any. When more people start exchange services, the formula used by the majority will be the one everyone has to use, since any differences in enchange rate larger than the transaction cost is can be easily exploited by arbitrageurs. Maybe you could mirror the nodelist from the IRC-server over http or ftp if the load's not too high. There's no need for the one to invest real money to be a developer :pWhat would it take for you to sell money or stuff thats worth something for bitcoins?(I was going to write what it would take for me here, but then I started thinking and came up with like 20 vague new ideas, and now it's late here and I have to sleep :p) Thats right =)The price is what people are prepared to pay or what they are willing to sell for.Maybe I shouldn't comment on NewLibertyStandard's reasons for setting his exchange rate, but he explains his current formula on his site..It will be interesting when others start bying and selling bitcoins, then the methods of determining exchange rates will have to take others rates into account... Bitcoin is using ip-adresses, not hostnames, so there's no need for dns. Tor thinks that since bitcoin is trying to connect to an ip without looking it up through tors internal dns, it's using a regular dns.Bitcoin is using port 8333, even though it's relaying it through tor on port 9050..  6667 is irc, bitcoin uses an irc-server to distribute the nodelist. (If you know the ip of another computer running bitcoin, you can specify the -connect option to avoid using the nodelist).No, it's enough if you're just connected to one single node, as long as it's got a copy of the longest block-chain. Why don't you make them send the email before the transaction? Then you could reply to that email with a new and unique bitcoin address. You don't even need to use email, it would be equally secure, although not that anonymous, to announce the customers email together with the bitcoin address on the frontpage of your site.The method you are using now is equal to someone sending you cash in an envelope anonymously, including a note with the time he posted it, after which you send goods back to the first person calling you stating the time and amount in the envelope. (Including the mailman and anyone who has access to you mailbox).  Sending the email before the transaction is equal to someone calling you, getting a unique box address which to send the money to. When the money arrives to that post box, you send the goods to the customer. Yes, I thought it had something to do with that.It would be nice if there was a wallet tool for merging wallet files, removing unused bitcoin addresses and as you say resyncing. (I tried to just re-download all the blocks, but as you know the transactions stayed anyway.)What about resyncing in the future when the Merkle-tree is pruned? I agree, it's risky, mostly because of the low usage.I'm not so sure about the lack of trust however. Since it's open source and using a well known hashing algorithm, anyone trusting that algorithm (SHA), and of course understands the basic principles of bitcoins, only has to trust that the implementation of that principle is correct.Another strength is that if you only trade with your generated bitcoins, you have nothing more to loose than the cost of electricity and possibly some of your time. It's basically free money as long as there's something to buy.This could even appeal to people who normally don't trust digital money at all, since they can get an introduction to online shopping/trading without having to go through that oh-so-scary step of actually entering their credit card number on the internet. Are you generating bitcoins, and if so then why do you see it as profitable?(Unfortunately it's not possible to create multiple choice polls. Choose your top reason.) Wallets already support multiple bitcoin addresses.You should check out "Options/Change your address" in your bitcoin app  No, you can't send a message when sending to an ip, but that's what the _unique_ bitcoin address is for.When the customer places an order, the server creates a new bitcoin address to be used for that order only. (This can be seen as the orderId if you want).When the customer makes a payment to that bitcoin address/orderId, the server will know who it's from.There's no need for a message.
