Of course, you can specify the username and password as part of the URL . Think a BC or two is deserved for that one  - sent. Sunday 19:00+ GMT is awesome for me  Whilst putting some security in is a good idea, it appears the JSON-RPC PHP doesn't support basic HTTP authentication right now. It'd have to be hacked in. Is anyone else using similar libraries going to encounter the same problem?Also, whilst we're on the subject is bitcoind only binding to the loopback interface? Do you buy them to order or keep a selection in stock @noagendamarket ? Maybe we could work together on a bigger combined store?  @jgarzik - Send me a private message detailing:Name of shopURLBitCoin address for paymentsShop software you are using/intend to use - e.g. UberCart/ZenCart/OSCommerce/OtherI'll take a look at your site and get the ball rolling. If you're actually buying gift certificates and you've started a new order go for it . Remember that those vouchers are for Amazon.co.uk and not Amazon.com. If you have any problems give us a shout - I've not stocked many vouchers on there yet as I'm somewhat testing the waters. Forgetting to remove that message there once open for business was slightly silly . I originally put that there whilst I was testing things were working.@davidonpda - To the best of my knowledge UK issued Amazon vouchers won't work on Amazon.com - only Amazon.co.uk. If there's a demand for it I'll look at stocking them - what kind of denominations would people find useful?  BitCoinPay - http://www.bitcoinpay.com/Buy denominations of Amazon.co.uk Gift Vouchers for BitCoin. Currently £1 = 20BC and £2.50 = £50BC. Vouchers automatically despatched upon receiving payment (normally done in about 20 minutes). Hello  I've been working setting up my own payment site for the last few days: http://www.bitcoinpay.com/. I'm currently looking to stock it with a few denominations of Amazon.co.uk gift vouchers for sale, but I also have a generic payment system which does callbacks. You can have a look at example transaction here:https://secure.bitcoinpay.com/checkout/?merchant_id=1&merchant_order=24&amount=1.000000If anyone else is interested in using it give us a shout - it automatically:Generates a BitCoin address for the transactionPresents the user with a nice page (which can be modified to taste) asking for paymentGives one click access to payment services such as MyBitCoin and VekjaKeeps note of payments made to that addressUpon hitting the amount specified sends a callback to the merchantAllows the user to see how much has been recieved along with number of confirmationsThere's an UberCart module in beta right now, and I'm looking to make plugins for OSCommerce and ZenCart.Update: After 2 confirmations the payment is sent straight to the merchant. You don't need to withdraw as such. Isn't the actual sending better handled by the BitCoin interface itself? There's been some talk on here about a URI schema for BitCoin (similar to the idea used by apps like Spotify/iTunes) that allow a link to launch the BitCoin interface pre-filled with address/amount information. It could be web based, but that opens up all kinds of attack vectors that need to be secured - possible to do, but personally I'd feel better seeing the BitCoin UI pop  up asking for confirmation knowing that some XSS attack isn't going to steal my coins  Phew - it's taken a couple of hours but it's now gone through . Wish I could generate coins more easily!  I'm having the same problem - opened BitCoin to create a transaction and possibly exited before it sent out the payment details. Now I have a 0/unconfirmed transaction.Having the ability to resend a stuck transaction would be nice - if no nodes have picked it up yet then surely sending it again won't cause an issue (and if some have then they'll just ignore it right?)
