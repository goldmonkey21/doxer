This is the drupal module that cforge uses.http://drupal.org/project/mutual_credit  I quite like the look of this software alsohttp://www.hughbarnard.org/content/alternative-currency-softwareI especially like the sms and encrypted email bit  [/quote]I'm the main author of cclite, described above, glad you like some bits of it...as I've explained in a private email, the digital cash world and LETS, credit clearing [Greco] etc. etc. are rather different structurally and philosophically. Then 'on top' there are major governance decisions [in the rest of this thread 'trusted issuer' would have some associated governance [banking regulator, appointed by nominally democratic government, for example, or not, that's the governance decision].Finally, most of my 'side', mutual social credit, credit clearing, small currencies, [in my case] multiple currencies usually have a social reform agenda concerning green issues, inequality issues, local area resilience etc. For that reason they are not aimed at global or really-large systems. There's problems with that inter-trading, useful mixes of offer/demand in the system etc. but that's the price they pay for a perception of federated resilience and local accountability. I'm involved in the transition town movement, for example. Cash or digital cash [according to some on the reform side, I'm actually waiting to see a system and its effects, I'm agnostic] won't really work in most of the reform cases described above, though it -may- transfer power from the 'banks' to more democratic groups [or not]. Incidentally that's also why I'm personally wary of re-creating sophisticated derivatives [I'm cool with harvest futures, they have a pretty clear purpose] because my aim is reform, rather than more of the same. So, I think that it's very healthy for everyone to talk and debate, but there are lots of differences in approach and desired effect on society.
