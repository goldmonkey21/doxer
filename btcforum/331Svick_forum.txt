How did you compute that time? 2983 confirmations / 6 confirmations per hour ≐ 497 hours ≐ 21 days.The result is this big because currently, block are generated much faster than one per 10 minutes. Yes, it's a macro defined in util.h asCode:#define loop for (;;) The fees are already implemented, in the case of very large transactions.It is done so that when you create a transaction, you put more bitcoins in than what goes out. The difference goes to whoever manages to create an accepted block with your transaction. If I wanted, I could modify my client so that your transaction is included in the block I'm generating only if it gives me enough bitcoins as a fee. If enough (generating) clients did this, it would be advantageous for you to add the fee to your transactions, so that they are processed faster. I'm no biochemist, so I'm not sure about this, but I think you could do that. Folding proteins is about finding states with low energy (because in nature, proteins occur in the state that has the lowest energy). So you could encode the information in a polypeptide, have some energy limit that you have to fit in order to generate the block and fold the polypeptide until you find a state with low enough energy. Verifying what energy does a certain state have should be relatively fast.On the other hand, such computations probably don't have any value to biochemists, so this would just replace one useless computation with another. Isn't that just because the difficulty increased? I don't think so. I think that if you created a block with lower difficulty than what I think is the current difficulty, I wouldn't accept it. That means I wouldn't accept any coins that originated in a block with this lower difficulty. This would effectively split the network in two. I can't connect to https://www.bitcoinmarket.com/ nor to https://98.168.172.185/. Is the site down? No, block is (as the FAQ says) just a sequence of transactions that happened since the last block was created plus a transaction that gives you the newly created bitcoins. It is just made so that creating this block is quite difficult. There is no central authority in the whole system (apart from an IRC feed used only to get other people's addresses). What I would like to see is lower time to get started  currently, it takes several hours just to download all the blocks, which amount to few megabytes of data.Or does it take so long because my PC has to verify all the blocks? How does that work? As far as I understand it, new bitcoins can be generated only by creating a new block, 50 BC at a time (for now). If the devs have some way to generate new bitcoins quickly, that would pretty much defeat the purpose of having P2P network with no central authority. Instead of trusting banks, we would have to trust the devs.
