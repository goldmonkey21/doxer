Flawless transaction with FreeMoney in a courteous and timely manner. No problems at all. A casino lottery system and an anonymous entity using an anonymous currency online is vastly different. A public business is held to much more scrutiny and if they cheat their customers, they are ruined for life (whereas a person around here can just create a new account the new day after a scam like nothing ever happened)For an internet scammer, 100,000 BTC (Or roughly $6,500 USD per todays standards) is definitely worth the hassle. I'm not accusing you of anything yet, but I'm just stating that it's not pennies and there are a lot of deceitful people that would go for an opportunity like that, especially when they can disappear tomorrow without a trace. 10 BTC isn't that much for one single person to lose, but how do we know that once you get a good number of Bitcoins you wouldn't just run away with the profit? I think this is the biggest problem you're facing and to overcome it would be no easy task. Even if it continued onto the 2nd or 3rd lottery, the feeling that you could take off at any moment would be a very real problem.Of course...that's a very real problem with nearly any Bitcoin venture at the moment...but this is a lot of cash to flow into one persons hand at once and not set an overtone of suspense.
