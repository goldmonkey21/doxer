I love stories with a happy ending. I just bought a bitcoin tshirt from http://somethinggeeky.com a UK site, but some those designs are pretty nice, might need another. Thats my plan for tonight sorted. You should definitely back up your bitcoins  Though you get so few,  not quite pico-bits, they are worth less than the transaction fee to send them anywhere. Ive been a forum member for years, since before newbie jail existed, but only realised i was in it when I couldnt post. bit of both, worried about attempts to make it illegal in future, UK banks already seem to be shutting down anyone who thinks about bitcoins. Hi, I've released the first version of a plugin for BugZilla that will give you bitcoin addresses for every bug in a bugzilla installation to allow people to sponsor the bugs and features.http://bugzilla.darkskiez.co.uk  is my bugtracker for it, so feel free to add bug/feature requests =] This first release may seem intentionally buggy in order to gain some sponsorship, but this is unintended.Plugin is Available at: http://github.com/darkskiez/bitcoinbugzilla/archives/v0.1 Using http://127.0.0.1:[bitcoinwebport]/whatever is a bit limiting, it requires that the user has the bitcoin client, and that the client is running.Using bitcoin:?whatever however allows us to add a uri handler to the browser, so it launches the client with the information if it is not running, or opens a window if it is running.In addition it allows websites to be registered as URI handlers, so people could register mybitcoin or other wallet service providing website to handle the request for them, without requiring the application. I find this a compelling argument to standardise on this style. I'd like to run some bitcoin daemons unattended, and have them generate the blocks but with a predefined public key, rather than a fresh one, so i don't have to check them manually / transfer coins manually.I have made do for the moment with a cron job that attempts to send 50 every hour
