MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 1 000 000 bytes1 000 000 bytes / 1024 = 976,56 bytesSo current (EDIT:) maximum blocksize limit is 976 kibibytes or 1000 kilobytes. That is the source of "976".But not all mines will always produce maximum blocksize blocks. Some even mine empty blocks. It has always been this way and it probably always will. And they have right to do so.By the way, that is the reason why blocks are full right now. Because there will never be a situation when all blocks are at 1MB, because some miners always mine smaller ones. Very well, I have misquoted something in a hurry. Thanks for clarification. Issue update:Peter Todd is starting to have serious doubts if implementing SegWit as soft fork is the right way to go:https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/43bgrs/peter_todd_sw_is_not_safe_as_a_softfork/EDIT: This was said by said by Pieter Wuille:So basically, Bitcoin Core may no longer be safe - and this is said by (edit:) Core-Team supporters.And guess what: Peter Todd actually proposes to do a hard-fork in order to make SegWit safe !Gavin Andersen said long ago that segwit as a soft-fork is worse than as a hard fork:http://gavinandresen.svbtle.com/segregated-witness-is-cool OK great, so that's it.You are officially a troll now and this is how I will treat you.Another troll pretender ?

Incorrect.Not vaporware, code is available, source:https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/693136607659069441Also there are already 48 nodes running, source:http://xtnodes.com/There is no proof whatsoever about what you are saying.The "weak chain" will quickly die, but you will able to move your coins to the "stronger chain" any time. No problem with that.I don't think the words you are saying mean what you think they mean, please elaborate.We don't need such proposal currently. Bitcoin does not need to scale to VISA levels tomorrow. Rome wasn't built in a day.Now, this is some kind of hardcore extreme bullshit.Explain in detail what you mean by "spam cannot be detected" and "stress test never ends" and what does it have to do with Bitcoin Classic or hard fork.0 confirmation transactions were never ever safe.So what is your point ?1MB is no kind of satoshi nakamoto "rule".1MB is simply a temporary anti-spam measure.Everybody knows this and Core developers also know this. Some of them are just too deep in shit with their heads to admit it.Is $50 a "proper fee" ?Once the network starts congesting, not only will the fees go up significantly, but Bitcoin transactions will become unreliable. This is why RBF was created by Peter Todd for Bitcoin Core. The only way you can make transactions fast & reliable with 1MB blocks is using RBF.But RBF is fatally flawed itself, check this out:RBF is optional for sender (opt-in), but not optional for receiver.1. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/42m4po/its_a_sad_day_when_core_devs_appear_to_understand/2. especially: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/42lhe7/usability_nightmare_rbf_is_sort_of_like_writing_a/3. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zju81/rbf_optin_a_man_walk_in_a_bar_order_a_coffe_drink/In short: You can choose whether to send RBF, you can choose whether to mine RBF, but you cannot choose whether you receive it or not."RBF is sort of like writing a paper check, but filling in the recipient's name and the amount in pencil so you can erase it later and change it." - /u/rowdy_beaver (on reddit.com/r/btc).RBF could have the potential to completely destroy 0-conf transactions widely & successfully used today.RBF / Bitcoin Core is a disaster waiting to happen. He has perfect understanding of how things would work after the fork, do you ?He is actually right, I can understand it (I am a technical person, though not Bitcoin developer).Hell, even Bitcoin Core/Blockstream developers can also surely understand it, but I am not sure if any of them is willing to admit that. They may be too deep with their heads in the bullshit, propaganda & manipulation web they have created.I don't think you understand how things work in Bitcoin network function at all.Once Bitcoin Classic wins, Bitcoin Classic becomes Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core stops being Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core will be *THE* altcoin you are talking about.No, this is not what I was asking.Let me rephrase the question: "how do you think consensus looks in Bitcoin world" ?Oh, it is extremely relevant.- Adam Back is the president of Blockstream.- Adam Back lies and manipulates, as clearly proven above- Adam Back condones censorship.- Adam Back has clear conflict of Interest as previously proved in this thread. - Adam Back wants to cripple the Bitcoin network for his personal (his company) gain.So yeah, it has everything to do with what is happening here, because anything that man says can be now treated as bullshit and/or manipulation of the topic for his gain.Let's sum it up.- Consensus is NOT what majority wants- Consensus is NOT what minority wantsLoigically, the only thing left is that Consensus, according to Adam Back, is what a strictly selected group of people wants. And that is exactly what I have stated.So for Adam Back, consensus is what Blockstream wants. Which is clearly visible in his posts.- He thinks he is smarter than everybody- He thinks he always knows better- He actually thinks he invented Bitcoin and it is his to do as he pleases.This is completely unacceptable for me and should be unacceptable for any Bitcoin user.Soe logically by what you are saying is:- Majority cannot override "consensus"- Users cannot override "consensus" (they are the majority !)So everything checks out. Blockstream / Bitcoin Core are the ones who define consensus. That is exactly the same I have said.This is incorrect, and this is not how Bitcoin network work.You are actually talking about how soft-fork would work.With hard fork, you can quickly & easily split 2 incompatibile parts of the network, so the one majority chooses becomes "the Bitcoin", and the other one is abandoned and dies.The separate chains coould obviously work as separate coins, but that is very difficult to maintain and therefore highly unlikely.- Gavin knows this- Jeff knows this- All Core devs know thisThe problem is whether they are willing to honestly admit this, because - as clearly proven above - some of them are lying bastards completely full of shit.Stop this offtopic now.I have proven that you are incorrect. That is all here.Oh, now I get it.You and me are talking about 2 different things.You are all the time talking about a soft-fork "consensus".I am talking about what happens when hard fork, not soft fork is performed.Hard fork is a clean cut. Soft fork is messy, because - as you say - it requires everybody to migrate to the new system, otherwise there may be problems.By the way, this is reason why what Core devs are trying to do is dangerous. They are trying to upgrade the network using soft-fork which requires much greater "consensus" than hard forks do.- To do hard fork, actually 60% "consensus" is enough. (but 75% is of course better) The other 40%/25% will quickly migrate to the winning side of the fork.- To do soft fork (which Core wants to do), 90% may not be enough. Just a quick thread refresh, so we all know what are we dealing with here...Proceeding with the discussion soon...----This is what this topic is about.

Check out yourself.If they wanted the best for Bitcoin users, they wouldn't have to lie, censor and directly attack their opponents. Such actions clearly show their evil intentions and their ulterior hidden agenda. Words are often meaningless. Words are cheap. These days you can actually detect bullshit and real intentions of evil people only by watching their actions.This is at least a 2000-year old truth. "You will recognize them by their fruits" it said in some ancient book.So basically, the side of the debate that resorts to censorship, lying, manipulation and attacks, is 99,99% of the time the dishonest side which is trying to do something evil while pretending to do something good. New archived thread backup (in case of censorship):https://archive.is/eYLZrEDIT:Well, that's enough for me today.Goodnight everybody. Nobody also wants to be on the minority branch. Gavin just did a great piece about what would happen if the network split 80/20.Check it out:http://gavinandresen.ninja/minority-branches (TL;DR: Nothing would really happen)Let's get on the same page. What actually is your definition of consensus ?Nope, I read it again - with context and I still think my argument stands.Please explain your point further because I don't understand what you think I am misunderstanding.Wait a minute... what exactly is your point ?Are you trying to say that if 100% users don't agree to change, then the change cannot happen ? Am I getting this right ?You can do anything and you can even fork Bitcoin in any way you want.If you can convince the majority of the network that your fork is the best and that giving 1000 BTC to poor children is the right choice and network will install your client then by all means - your client will be considered the "true" Bitcoin, and the previous client will be made obsolete and nobody will use it.However the probability you could pull something like this is almost equal to zero.This is basically completely wrong and has no basis in anything. I don't think you understand what a soft fork and hard fork is.Here is a pretty good explanation:http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/30817/what-is-a-soft-forkIn short, I would say that hard forks are the ones that split the network in 2 separate ones - old and new - and make a "clean cut", while soft forks "pretend" to all old clients that nothing has changed, so the old clients can keep working (but important: the old clients are not working 100% correctly while not knowing that anything happened).So basically, hard fork is kind of more open and honest way of doing changes, while soft-fork is more of a "sneaky" way that makes a change and pretends that nothing has happened to the network.I think I explained it right. Well it is not really dangerous. Your money will not be lost.The worst thing that could happen is you get but scammed but - as I said - it is not so easy a scam to pull.Well yeah, but what kind of comparison is this ? USD is not a new, dynamically developing technology.I am sure that after 50 years Bitcoin will also stabilize and become the "boring, old Bitcoin" that everybody knows. But not now, not today.Well sorry, but if some merchant on the other end of the world is many months behind what is happening in Bitcoin world, then that is seriously his problem.The technological landscape & Bitcoin landscape are moving & changing extremely fast. You have to keep up just to stay alive. That is kind of normal.To convince me, you need stronger arguments. The ones you have given are not super-strong and absolute.Well, you could be correct to some extent. What you say may even be true and might happen, but the probability of that happening is rather low.Nowehere I said that you have a hidden agenda.Lately I am becoming better and better at detecting bullshit. I don't see any bullshit in what you are saying. Just average arguments. If they won't upgrade, the new clients will not even sync with the old relays, because blocks will be seen as invalid by the clients.If we are talking about SPV clients, which don't see any blocks, then their money will also not be lost. They will regain the control of their money once all of them (relay/processor + client) upgrade. The money will not be lost in (almost ?) any case.Also, generally when running business it is your goddamn job to make sure that everything is ok. If you don't know that, you should not even start a business.The grace period is actually much much longer, because the whole situation will be widely known at least few months before that happens. So companies actually have months to change, not weeks.Well, I think that covers it. But now everybody will have a lot of time to prepare for such scams.Also payment processors have insurance, so not so big problem really. Exactly.This is why there is a 2-week (or a month - was it ?) "grace period". So, after number of Bitcoin Classic nodes reach 75% it gives few weeks time to everybody to upgrade.Yes, of course - there will be some problems, perhaps even some people will get scammed. But I don't think it will be much.All payments processors will surely upgrade in time, so it will be only single rare cases of users that do person-to-person transactions (but scamming this way would only work if the scammer knew that the person has old version of software).Such scam will not be easy to pull. So relays it is.I will tell you now how to reach hard-fork "consensus" using relays.1. Make all relays (or let's assume 75% of relays) upgrade to the Bitcoin Classic2. The old software that the relays are not using becomes irrelevant3. Miners, seeing that they are mining using outdated software (and thus are/will be on the wrong chain) quickly upgrade their software to Bitcoin Classic, because otherwise they would lose all profits.4. Big payment operators, seeing what is happening, also quickly upgrade their software to Bitcoin ClassicAll happens within days, if not hours.5. All the rest of the network (laggards) upgrades to Bitcoin Classic (this may take little longer time)Boom ! Consensus reached, baby. Also note that the money left on the old version aren't lost. Users just need to upgrade to use them.
Are we talking about clients, relays or miners ? Adam Back lies you all in the face and pretends like nothing has happened.What he says has nothing to do with original Bitcoin social contract designed by Satoshi. The original vision was that majority of miners and majority of users decide. Users decide by running their clients and miners decide by mining the longest chain. If users start using a client with another chain that is the longest, miners switch to that.It is really simple. Users decide. MAJORITY of users decide. Where the hell did he get the "minority" from ?Also, please remember that even if you don't understand Bitcoin technically, you can still vote correctly in the blocksize debate: How ? The only thing that you actually need to consider is the actions taken by both sides of the debate.There is only one side of the debate here that repeatedly tries to stifle discussion by resorting to censorship, DDoSing, outright lying while simultaneously pretending that nothing is actually happening. Check out yourself.If they wanted the best for Bitcoin users, they wouldn't have to lie, censor and directly attack their opponents. Such actions clearly show their evil intentions and their ulterior hidden agenda. Words are often meaningless. Words are cheap. These days you can actually detect bullshit and real intentions of evil people only by watching their actions.This is at least a 2000-year old truth. "You will recognize them by their fruits" it said in some ancient book.So basically, the side of the debate that resorts to censorship, lying, manipulation and attacks, is 99,99% of the time the dishonest side which is trying to do something evil while pretending to do something good. 100% consensus is most probably unachievable because of the ability of a single powerful miner to destroy consensus.I assume we are talking about miner consesus, right ?1. But that is not really important. The last time hard fork happened (because of network malfunction), the network upgraded, resolved itself & reached "consensus" in around 6 hours. So miner consensus can happen almost instantly. Nobody wants to be on the losing side of the fork - that is pretty obvious.2. Lately "consensus" means whatever Adam Back wants it to mean. Check out these links:https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/434spq/adam_back_on_twitter_understand_bitcoin_social/https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/692756252418576384So basically now he claims that consensus is what minority (Blockstream) wants. He has lost it and is completely mad with power.Last time I remember, Bitcoin was all about what majority wants. When minority wants to change rules of the game then it is called a HARD FORK and they go their separate way. You have nothing.A screen that can be really easily faked is not a fact or proof of any kind.Also your inability to post may be a technical malfunction.EDIT:Again, offtopic. Not continuing this any longer. What's with the offtopic making, people ? Can't you really stay straight for an hour ? Arguments.Seriously, are you a child ? Start the arguments or leave the train.Or you can also state: "You are right, my arguments were incorrect" and that will do it.EDIT:This thread has been archived for posterity:https://archive.is/6Oqgk /r/btc is not censored.

Evidence no. 1. Luke-Jr working on Blockstream's project:https://github.com/ElementsProject/elementsproject.github.io/graphs/contributorsThere is more, of course, but do we really need it ?About Peter Todd: seems I was indeed wrong, there is no direct evidence linking him to blockstream. Correcting this now. Can you stop already ?I only respond to logic. You cannot scare me or manipulate my ego with this shitty tactic. Sorry, my mistake.These two are only strongly affiliated with blockstream. Not employees.I will have proof in a minute, working really hard here. Sorry. No arguments, not answering this. Much worse.I am an annoying troll with logic & arguments.Can't stand it, can you ? The 1MB cap is a completely irrelevant temporary thing, which Satoshi clearly stated.At the time of the cap's creation, the proportion of avg. block size to block size limit was over 1 MILLION. So today to keep the proportions, the proper block size limit should be around 1 GB. I don't care what's best for China, I care what is the best for Bitcoin.And what is the best for Bitcoin is also best for China.BTW,Notice it - the guy changed topic again. This may be a manipulative tactic used in order to water down the discussion. This day just gets better and better. Hahahaha.That's a nice downplaying manipulation right there.Actually most of prominent Bitcoin Core devs also work for Blockstream:Adam BackGregory MaxwellLuke-JrMatt CoralloPieter WuillePeter Todd - EDIT: incorrect, my mistakeThat's not all - people above are actually the founders of Blockstream & whole lightning concept.Just a reminder, Adam Back, president of blockstream openly condones censorship:https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3hbpg0/adam_back_openly_shows_his_agreeableness_to/https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3hbpg0/adam_back_openly_shows_his_agreeableness_to/Gregory Maxwell also condones censorship:https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/42vqyq/blockstream_core_dev_greg_maxwell_still_doesnt/And he is a manipulative lying bastard, proof:https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/438udm/greg_maxwell_caught_red_handed_playing_dirty_to/And he openly supports attacking competing projects:https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/41c1h6/greg_maxwell_unullc_just_drove_the_final_nail/...which Adam Back also does. He really likes sabotage, that one:https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/3hc4nu/adam_back_openly_shows_his_agreeableness_to/The arguments provided above should be enough for anybody to abolish Bitcoin Core forever. But there is of course much, much, much more from last year. Hahahaha, that was actually a funny one.Still, not on topic.Anyway, I don't really care about your opinion. Dear Sir.I have provided plenty of logical arguments of which all your posts are lacking.So seriously, what kind of discussion do you expect with me ? When discussing with me:- Stay strictly on topic (I perceive straying off topic as a manipulative & defensive tactic)- Use logic- Use factual argumentsSo please, stop wasting my time and start the real discussion. I will repeat this once more, for posterity:Saying that "bitcoin is hashcash extended with inflation control" is exactly like saying that "car is just horse carriage extended with combustion engine"A person who said such thing must have HUGE ego problems.The source of the quote:https://twitter.com/adam3usMirror in case he changes it: Seriously ?I hope twitter is working for you ?https://twitter.com/adam3us You have no idea who are you talking to, so stop assuming things.You don't know everything about the person on the other side of the monitor.You don't. I am not a young person. I am full aware that I am not very polite on the internet.But with age & experience, I found out that it works better (most of the time) than being too polite.I have my years, but already decided that I will not grow up. Never.I have seen over the years that "growing up" too often means just agreeing with establishment and pretending that "everything is OK" while it is far from it.So no matter how old I will be, I will never "grow up".
Well said. I will repeat it once more:Saying that "bitcoin is hashcash extended with inflation control" is exactly like saying that "car is just horse carriage extended with combustion engine"A person who said such thing must have HUGE ego problems. Please don't.You are so naive and have completely no understanding of the topic you are discussing. It would be a waste of time. Well, using this way of thinking you could say that horse carriage inventors invented cars (because car is essentially just a horse carriage with combustion engine, right ?). Are you actually serious, or is this some form of sophisticated propaganda ?You know, the blocks are actually getting quite full NOW. Also, guess what: in peak hours blocks get completely full (huge transaction backlog).And SegWit is realistically at least 2 years from ready (including testing, implementation in all other clients and so).Lightning Network is realistically at least 3-4 years from ready (including testing, implementation in all other clients and so).https://tradeblock.com/bitcoinhttps://www.google.pl/search?q=mempool+backlog&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=rH-rVtyGKIX1UpKpt6ALYou can't wait for a complex magical unicorn like LN or SegWit for come and save the day, while we have a practical, working solution right now and it can be deployed in hours.This is some pretty obvious stuff, If you don't know this you must be pretty uninformed or you have a hidden agenda. Oh yeah, you are right.Bitcoin Core is the fork that is contentious. It forked off the original vision of Satoshi.1MB LIMIT was **never** supposed to be any kind of economical limit. It was only a quick-fix for DDoS and (at the time) it was at least million of times bigger than average block size.So, if we would keep the ratio, today the block size LIMIT should be at least 1GB.[sarcasm]Why do we need this satoshi guy anyway for ? Adam Back is the true inventor of Bitcoin after all ![/sarcasm] Hah. You are so easy & naive.Obviously, not all of them have to be corrupted for the Core to be corrupted. If only the ones at the steering wheel will be corrupted and the others are not, but will agree to everything the management does, the outcome will still be the same.I mean what the hell are we even talking about ? Are you even familiar with the events of last 2 weeks ? The events of last 10 days should be enough for every good, honest & truthful person to hate Blockstream & Bitcoin Core for eternity !I got the feeling we are not on the same page here. I am discussing very serious issues indeed. Namely, the corruption and obvious conflict of interest of BitcoinCore and Blockstream.However I have no idea what are you discussing. @eric@haobtcThe most important and wise thing for you and all the chinese miners to do is to completely leave Bitcoin Core.Even if Bitcoin Core agrees to 2MB, still:- They are broken & corrupt with power, - They think they always know everything better,- They don't give a fuck (no, really) about what the users want- They (most probably) use censorship to force their view on usersWhether Core can compromise or not, they just need to go. Such corrupt, insane & power-hungry people cannot steer Bitcoin into success.Want proof ? Just check Adam Back's (Blockstream's President) twitter profile. The guy thinks he actually invented Bitcoin ! If that is not insanity, I don't know what is.EDIT:Here, archived for posterity: You even talking to me ?I am not sure, because you are completely not on topic.  Core will not compromise. They think they are goddamn geniuses who know what's better for everyone.They are very much like the totalitarian government you have in you country. Including censorship.I cannot prove that it is Blockstream that organized the censorship thing, but it is highly likely (99% probability for me).Just think for a minute about what future you will have with Core team. They don't even care about your view. They don't give a fuck about your profits. They only care about their business model. I will not even waste my time discussing here with you. People like you will be made obsolete when the hard fork comes. And it will come as soon as the networks starts really congesting.This platform completely sucks for discussion anyway, this is why I don't even come here anymore. Also, this forum is censored - the same as /r/bitcoin - by the small block supporters of which gmaxwell himself is.Oh, and by the way, he also condones the censorship. So essentially you are selling fee-based private sidechains with customer support ?And limiting main Bitcoin chain in order to force customers onto your sidechains ?Wasn't Blockstream supposed to have no conflict of interest with Bitcoin ?Man, you BS guys all are so full of shit. This will not go unnoticed.    Nope. And not planned, really.If you want to compile/build it, check this out:Ubuntu:http://bitzuma.com/posts/compile-bitcoin-core-from-source-on-ubuntu/Windows:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=149479.0My version builds exactly the same way as normal version, so these instructions should work.EDIT:Also, because of latest transaction spam attacks, i would advise against using this fork anymore. I am actually updating it because I do not want to forget and lose this code. So kind of for historical reasons. This is because of banks' crazy-ass AML procedures (suspicious activity !).The banks have gone really mad in the last 2 years. You cannot do anything about it, if you transfer money to the cards from another country few times, any card may be blocked. I had multiple cards blocked before, now I am more careful.I suggest to use LocalBitcoins to purchase and transfer local currency (such as PLN) to the cards, so you don't have to make an international transfer. I confirm that this is a trustworthy seller. Purchased some cards few days ago, all went smoothly  As stated in the first post, probably not.Also, the fee calculation algorithm drastically changed in 0.10, so it may be needed much less than before. I am going to do some testing Soon to check what exactly are the current benefits of using it. If there is very little difference between Core and this then I may stop supporting this patch. 2015-05-10 Update:NFTF - versions 0.10.0 & 0.10.1 released.Fresh tags - nftf-v0.10.0, nftf-v0.10.1 are avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagshttps://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/archive/nftf-v0.10.1.tar.gzhttps://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/archive/nftf-v0.10.0.tar.gzMASTER branch was updated to the newest tag (0.10.1). For that to happen, the total % increase of gold digged out of the ground would have to be bigger than total % increase of goods & services in the economy.It is possible, but not very probably. Why and how population grew is another discussion for another time, you are messing with things that are not related to this discussion.By "deflation" i meant decrease in prices caused by scarce money / goods supply.So productivity and inventions stopped/slowed down in XIX century ? Did the industrial revolution stop at the beginning of XX century ?That is so stupid that I will not even take you seriously from now on. Actually this is blatantly false.Deflation is only deadly to inflation-based economy, which should be kind of obvious. If you base the foundation of your economy on never ending supply of money created by governments & banks, then deflation (as in decrease in the money supply) WILL be deadly. No suprise here, really.Human economy has been based on deflation for the first few thousand years as all resources (including gold, silver, diamonds and other precious things) are finite and cannot be created on demand. Only the last century is truly inflationary. 
If you like this, please also upvote me on Reddit:http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2wuybh/inflationbased_economy_is_essentially_a_scam/----------------------------------------------Think about it for a minute, here are some arguments:How inflationary economics works:1. Value of the currency falls -> Saving under the mattress is not feasible -> So we make deposit at a bank2. Because you cannot save under the mattress, you need a loan to invest -> You go to a bank3. Because of taking more and more loans ( see: Money creation, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqvKjsIxT_8 ), a never ending and self-sustaining debt is created in the system. You cannot ever completely repay this debt and it creates otherwise senseless investments aimed at repaying the debt -> Bank benefits4. Because the money keeps losing value, you have to spend it -> This creates stupid, otherwise pointless consumption and production of goods & services, that are not really needed.Cui bono ? Who benefits ? Banks of course.However it works completely different a world based on deflationary economics:1. Value of the currency rises -> Saving under the mattress is a valid way to make money -> Bank loses2. Taking loans is not viable, because you would have to give back more in goods & services (+ interest) than you loaned -> Bank loses3. Investments can be financed from savings, not loans -> Bank loses4. Because money keep getting more value, it is not profittable to invest in weak buisnesses and buying things that you don't really need (it's better to keep the money under mattress) -> This lowers the amount of mindless consumption and increases investments into technologies that make real difference and bigger profits.Who benefits ? Everyone except banks and over-hyped companies.So IMO not only the deflation-based economy decreases banks' power over people, but it also shifts investments from focusing on mindless consumption gadgets into creating real change and things that matter.Maybe the time for this centuries-old scam to end is now. I am currently reviewing if it is still necessary to maintain this fork as Bitcoin Core 0.10 has a new, improved fee selection UI.Perhaps i will request my code being merged into the Bitcoin Core mainline, since now it could be easily done.Stay tuned. This. This is excellent.Good work on explaining it this way.With this post, you have done a great deed to support the Bitcoin long-term. Yeah, I already know about this. Good work, guys. (Yes - you too, Luke - even though i really hate your Gentoo patches). Oh, that is just beautiful. New versions of OpenSSL such as 1.0.0Q and 1.0.0L came out.Are they affected by the bug ? Somebody knows ETA of a fix coming out ? From hardware side:- No Lenovo or HP laptops- No Intel (take AMD)- If you already have intel (i do too, unfortunately), install a non-Intel networking card- Install OpenWrt in your router. But first, buy only routers that support OpenWrt. List: http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/startIf you adhere to above rules, there probability of attack should be diminished by something around 99,9% (lucky guess).Also, if you have Windows + Intel, you are pretty much screwed up. Linux does not have driver support for activating of Intel AMT from EXEcutable file, so it is relatively safe to run binaries not worrying that some of them will contain a trojan which will install itself into AMT. Remember: Intel AMT has its own memory and can run code ! Its a PC within your PCFrom social side: I have no idea. But i will look it up sooner or later. This one:http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2013/08/thoughts-on-intels-upcoming-software.htmlAnother (trying to hack it):[PDF] https://ruxconbreakpoint.com/assets/2014/slides/bpx-Breakpoint%202014%20Skochinsky.pdfIt is currently widely known - so it is not a secret known only to tinfoil-hats. However, nobody cares (or too many people have Intel onboard, so they don't want to believe). Not stable or tested enough yet.People, stop suggesting LibreSSL. One can seriously fuck up his/hers system by replacing a core library by an unstable solution.Once LibreSSL is proven not to be dangerous, it can be used instead of OpenSSL You must be an Intel fanboy, because you are fucking useless. Try reading sources before commenting, because you sound as truly and completely half-wit person. - It has been already proven by a security researcher that the feature is NOT completely disabled after switching it off in BIOS- There is currently no way to completely disable the feature in a way which can be verified- There is currently NO way to reverse engineer what exactly is the AMT even doing, because it's all encrypted to the fucking rootPlease fix yourself and be smarter, because i really fucking hate talking to stupid people. You have no idea what you are talking about.Nobody should have access to my machine without me knowing AND without me having the ability to disable it. AND i should always know exactly what my machine is doing, creating another PC within my PC that is separate and not under my control is simply UNACCEPTABLE from security standpoint. This is just Intel creating a trojan in all machines which either will be or already is being used by somebody to hack you. End of story. This is serious.Anybody knows when is a patch coming ? Intel = NSANetIntel CPUs/MBs older than 2011 are probably completely safe.However, the worst part is - we cannot actually be sure. Intel has hard-wired code in all motherboards supporting their CPUs and nobody knows what the code is or what it does. It is completely encypted and has strong DRM.This is not the work of an honest company. This is an obviously evil plot. I don't know what you should do, but I am surely stopping buying anything from Intel.Too bad I already bought 2 intel motherboards lately. Well, it would be a big waste of money and time to sell them and buy new ones, so i will be installing non-intel network cards on these while leaving the built-ins unused - that will at least protect me from remote hack. Still, i need to be careful when downloading *.exe files from internet, because any of them could be a rootkit. Lucky for me, I don't use Windows too much (maybe just for selected games), so that is not a big problem. Yep, AMT was already hacked once, but Intel quickly patched the hole.But since we have no way of knowing what resides in that special, hidden, encrypted, DRMed software in Intel's AMT, anything could be in there. And you can be sure that NSA will put their nasty fingers in it sooner or later (if it hasn't already).Intel has just created grounds for domination of permanently NSA-FBI-CIA-rootkited hardware on the market (since most M/B chips are Intel's anyway). And their backdoor is extremely sophiscticated, there is nothing else close to it on the consumer & server market.Intel cannot be trusted anymore. Still better than waiting for unknown hacker to steal the key and do the same in secrecy ?Once sources and keys are published, the AMTs in Intel chipsets can be patched (and disabled) by the Open Source community. Now it is not even possible to fix the problem. Also, we don't really know what the embedded code actually does, since it is not open source. That is not true.Any Windows application which contains proper Intel's keys and SGX code can activate the mechanism.So it is essentially only necessary to make you download an *.exe file, which will activate AMT and install rootkit into it. It's a beefed-up version of SONY's rootkit. But this time you have no way of detecting, controlling or removing it.What's even better is that you have really no way of detecting what is inside of the *.exe ! The content of the application is completely encypted ! Isn't it simply beautifully fucked up ?Source:http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2013/09/thoughts-on-intels-upcoming-software.htmlIntel has all of us royally screwed over. I would advise against buying *ANYTHING* from Intel, until they publish the sources and private keys or abolish AMT alltogether. Simply encrypting anything won't work. The Intel AMT's processor has full access to everything your normal CPU has. And it has higher privileges !As previously stated, using a non-Intel network card inserted into PCI/PCIe slot should at least disable the possibility of remote activation.However, once somebody working for NSA/CIA/FBI/other TLAs stays with your machine in the same room, you have to essentially throw the mainboard away, as there is absolutely no way of either detecting or disabling a rootkit once it is installed in Intel's AMT.A rootkit can be installed via USB for example. USB is vulnerable - regardless of what operating system you are running. My reddit thread got silent-removed even though i had like 50 upvotes ?How the hell does reddit moderation work ?Should I start to believe in reddit conspiracies or something ?
Apparently for the remote control to work, you also need to have Intel network card, so not using any Intel network hardware should keep you safe from remote attack. We don't. But apparently, even if they have something, it is nowhere near the level of complexity and sophistication of Intel's technology.Intel has a goddamn separate CPU that you can run apps (think rootkits) on. And this special CPU has higher priority when it comes to control of the system than normal CPU. This is disgusting. This is probably one of these "Elephant in the room" topics.Everybody knows it, but nobody talks about it. Most of new Intel chipsets have a deliberately built-in backdoor that allows : Remote access to your machine even when computer is turned off (but plugged to power & network socket). Intel's AMT is actually active when computer's power button is OFF. Hiding code of some apps & malware from the running system using sophisticated DRM scheme Installing a rootkit / trojan that cannot be removed even if the disk, RAM memory and BIOS are all wiped out clean. Run signed JAVA code outside of CPU !What's more: It works outside of the control of CPU, system and BIOS It's closed source (obviously) Intel doesn't want to say how it works Intel (so NSA & US govt too) has secret keys, using which they can totally control your machine with totally no way of you detecting it It cannot be turned completely OFF (there is a BIOS switch, but as proven - it does not work fully)Please upvote me on reddit:http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ri5a9/if_you_are_using_newer_intel_mainboard_with_intel/ (reddit thread got silently mod-removed again !)Sources:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technologyhttps://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/active-management-technologyhttp://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2013/08/thoughts-on-intels-upcoming-software.htmlhttp://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2013/09/thoughts-on-intels-upcoming-software.htmlRelated:Discussion on polish Bitcoin forum: https://forum.bitcoin.pl/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=16562One of polish biggest IT news sites: http://www.dobreprogramy.pl/Komputery-z-procesorami-Intela-sa-kontrolowane-przez-Intela,News,60132.htmlhttps://twitter.com/rosyna/status/550702351703875584PS.Intel has been working on this technology for over 15 years, so their hands are deep in shit.

WARNING !TL;DR; The Polish Bitcoin Community had a very long and very painful discussion with Crypotoworld's Support about existing critical bugs in Cryptoworld's architecture.Response from Cryptoworld's support team was in short essentially "it's you who are stupid and trolling, we will not talk to you".Their support is aggressive and unhelpful, they refuse to even acknowledge their mistakes.Link to original thread on polish Bitcoin forum: https://forum.bitcoin.pl/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=16028My (and Polish Bitcoin community's) advice: Stay as far as you can from this "business". ----! UWAGA !TL;DRPolska społeczność Bitcoin miała długą i bolesną dyskusję z obsługą serwisu Cryptoworld na temat istniejących krytycznych bugów w architekturze ich serwisu.Odpowiedzią obsługi technicznej było w skrócie "to wy jesteście głupi i trollujecie, nie będziemy z wami rozmawiać".Ich pracownicy są agresywni i niepomocni, odmawiają przyznania się do swoich błędów.Link do oryginalnego wątku na polskim forum Bitcoin: https://forum.bitcoin.pl/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=16028Moja (i polskiej społeczności Bitcoin) opinia: Trzymać się jak najdalej od tej "firmy".   2014-10-05 Update:NFTF - version 0.9.3 released.Fresh tag - nftf-v0.9.3 is avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsMASTER branch was updated to the newest version (0.9.3). Yep, coming (this weekend probably). OMG, I am now a ★LEGENDARY★ member !!That feels great man ! Nope, unfortunately NFTF is a very minor patch, only changing one small aspect of client's behavior. NFTF fork causing crash ? Well, this is highly unlikely. There is no significant change in the code that could cause the crash. Please compile the standard client (without the patch) and do a test in *EXACTLY THE SAME CONDITIONS* to find out if it is really the fork causing the crash. 2014-08-10 Update:NFTF - versions 0.9.2 & 0.9.2.1 released.Fresh tags - nftf-v0.9.2, nftf-v0.9.2.1 are avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsMASTER branch was updated to the newest version (0.9.2.1). Try polish Bitcoin forum https://forum.bitcoin.pl/ No, no. And - most importantly:No.Stop making stupid threads please. Oh, I was afraid it could be something like this...Great, that thing again. Im lovin' it (NOT). Just had an idea.What if instead of mining just single valid block per 10 minutes, miners could mine (for example) 100 blocks simultaenously with 100 - times lower difficulty, which would then be treated as one single block in the blockchain ?What i mean in detail:1. Miners can mine X blocks simultaneously, all of which can be valid and added to the blockchain, but2. Difficulty is X times lower (or insert proper difficulty calculation algorithm here)3. Block reward is split by X. Each of the small-block rewards goes to the miner who mined it.4. X adjusts automatically with difficulty Y. The bigger Y is, the bigger X becomes and the more pieces are produced each 10 minutes.5. After all the small blocks are mined, they are merged back into one normal-sized block, which then is inserted into the blockchain.This way, mining pools are not really necessary, every miner could mine solo (or in tiny pools). The biggest problem i see now with it is deciding which mini-blocks get included in the final big block. Am I making any sense, or is this one hell of a crazy idea ? Please bear with me. Already said that.Read *anything* before you post, please. I will just for once assume that you are asking seriously.Because making any bitcoins worse than other would destroy fungibility of Bitcoin, could possibly create endless chain of dependencies which could then pollute "clean" Bitcoins and, most importantly, would require a hard fork therefore ultimately and completely obliterating the whole idea of Bitcoin.Making any coins worse than other because of somebody's stupid desires is a no-go and I (and most of early adopters) would leave Bitcoin the minute somebody tries something like this.Was that clear enough for you? Wait... Is their payout directly based on the number of posts, or is primedice this some kind of ponzi scheme?
OP is a troll or an idiot or has a very specific agenda. Ignore mode on.EDIT: BTW:Let's do even better: AVENGERS ASSEMBLE! No.You were talking about mining and now you are pretending that you weren't so that everybody here doesn't think you are a fool. But you are and it is too late and everybody here already knows that.Stop lying, stop pretending, stop misinforming, stop this bullshit and just admit you were wrong. This is the road to improvement of your weakness - face it, do not run from it, coward. Somebody mentioned on reddit that GetBlockTemplate does not actually solve the problem completely.Well, too bad. Read with understanding, nowhere i said it solves "51% attack problem". I said it solves the current 51% crisis - big difference.Getblocktemplate does not allow a pool operator to easily execute 51% attack even if he controls more than 51% of mining power, consisting of many individual miners. It seems the solution to our 51% crisis has been already created and is called getblocktemplate.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Getblocktemplatehttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0022https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0023Or am I wrong somewhere ?Another question is: Why aren't the big pools using it ?Yet another question is: Why didn't Gavin at least mention it in his Bitcoin Foundation blog post ?Also, check out (and possibly upvote) me on Reddit:http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/284frp/solution_to_51_crisis_getblocktemplate/ If Bitcoin becomes REALLY expensive, the developers will have to lower the fees in the core client anyway (or finally create a dynamic fee calculation/voting algorithm). You and the only other guy using it.

Ripple is NOT Bitcoin. And will never be.It is not even similiar to Bitcoin. Nuff said. Ripple is finally dead. How wonderful. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect[/TOPIC]Seriously, this topic can now be closed. There is nothing more to say here. And your point is ? Because porn was one of the most inportant factors in winning BetaMax vs VHS and BluRay vs HD-DVD wars.If porn industry heavily adopts some technology, the technology becomes unstoppable. Like with prostitution. Ah, so I was (partially) right after all.Well, that's right - you can still make longer fake chains. OK, nothing more for me to do here.  Well then, wouldn't it be possible to put in checkpoints containing parts (or hashes) of the historically valid chain, so it becomes impossible to supply a longer fake chain ? Now I am confused (apparently).Weren't checkpoints supposed to contain hashes of specific blocks so it would be impossible to supply entire fake blockchain that is ahead of the real one ?Didn't Satoshi implement checkpoints for such attack to be impossible ? They should, but not in my experience with Electrum.Already done several times, not working. Bumping. Offtopic: It is nice to finally see you taking matter in your own hands instead of walking around and complaining.Respect. Well Ripple is not completely dead, but the hype has burnt out and people have seen through its premine centralized bullshit and apparently want nothing to do with it.
OK, i found out how to fix the issue. It was really trivial.In the network connection dialog, change the connection type from "SSL" to "HTTPS". Problem solved. Or rather - this is only a workaround.Apparently, some electrum servers are no longer providing the "SSL" service and moving to "HTTPS" instead ? Am I understanding this right ?Can we get some official from Electrum staff to answer ? Actually nowadays fixing a transaction potentially(still, low probability) broken by using my fork is getting easier and easier.For example, you could probably undo a broken transaction (with not enough fees included) using Bitundo:http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/234iem/bitundo_allowing_you_to_undo_bitcoin_transactions/Of course, you can always do it using raw transaction API, but that's complex. Oh BTW, this is what I am getting in console, don't know if related:Code:"sni-qt/3402" WARN  10:48:23.875 void StatusNotifierItemFactory::connectToSnw() Invalid interface to SNW_SERVICE  That is weird, one day Electrum was connected normally and everything worked. And then, i closed it and started again. After I did that it never worked anymore.There were absolutely no changes made to the system Electrum version (it was 1.9.7 and now it is 1.9.8 - still the same issue). I have tried different servers on the list, I even tried connecting to IP (as I read on the forums that it may be a DNS issue).The system is Linux Mint 16 (based on Ubuntu).Any ideas ? What world are you living in ?Bitcoin is currently approaching mainstream. We need a lot more work before it will be easy to use for average Joe Sixpack, but it is only a matter of time.Also, HitBTC, you are VULNERABLE to a HUGE OPENSSL flaw.Please 1. Shut down your service immediately as you are potentially leaking your sensitive data & your users private data to attackers2. Apply patches on the software3. REVOKE all your previously and currently used SSL certificates4. Get new certificates from your issuer5. Restart your serviceI am dead serious. More information:http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/22gq5e/heartbleed_bug_major_openssl_vulnerability_could/http://heartbleed.com/http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/#hitbtc.comRemember, just applying patches is not enough, you should treat your SSL keys as already stolen, since there is no method of detecting this attack ! The issue seems to be fixed, i have received said emails. Thank you for quick reaction. Any idea when it will be fixed ? I have tried to deposit some money via SEPA transfer today, and all i got was:Code: "You have successfully submitted the form. Please wait for an email with bank transfer instructions." Sadly, the email with instruction never arrives, while emails from support arrive properly.Am I doing something wrong ? Can I make the audit myself using the tools given ?Or do i need access to the database of Kraken ? Wow, i haven't noticed this earlier. This should be named the post of the year.  OMG, i think what you described is a serious material for next Bitcoin-level breakthrough... Definately this is a great concept. I think that in spite of existing attack vectors, it still is useful. Well i haven't been following the discussion as well, but for example https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/ already supports it.It seems the implementation is not very widespread across Bitcoin clients however. Hello @etotheipi,Any plans for BIP38 in Armory anytime soon ? Awesome, i was waiting for a post like this.On the topic, programmers nowadays have very powerful tools like IDE's, Diff/Meld, Version control software such as Git, which makes putting a backdoor into anything more difficult than most people would think.Most changes are not so big and are incremental changes, it is easy to review them by an experienced programmer. Man that is an EXCELLENT JOB !I warn you, I am going to throw Bitcoins at you ! (or maybe purchase some stuff on your site). @k99I was thinking about the name of your exchange and i think you should seriously consider naming it "BankRun" (or "BankRunner" - so the name won't interefere directly with name of bank run concept).After all, why pretend anything and dilute the reason for which the app was made ? What i mean is, the banking system is broken beyond repair and i think we should be bold saying it out loud. If there existed such an easy way to compute private keys, then Bitcoin was doomed from the start. Well, actually - maybe the whole Internet would be doomed, as no SSL or SSH session would ever be safe.Luckily, that's rather improbable. 
Yep.If a hard fork was done to print more coins, i would definately leave Bitcoin...Some rules are meant *not* to be changed. You can't just print gold out of thin air. Bitcoin is the new gold. An action like this would literally destroy Bitcoin. You still didn't get it. You are right, this post was a waste of time. This is an excellent week for Bitcoin.The death of MtGox (FINALLY !) is great news alone. There are more adoptions, more good news from previous adoptions. I don't see much bad news actually. The transaction malleability was a minor bug. No other exchanges except of MtGox were affected. What is sad is that you played with people's money on a Stock Market, lost it and expect that nobody cares.I mean, WTF is wrong with you ?Shut up and get some humility, since you currently are a fraud and con artist.(I really hate insolent people). OH FINALLY, THEY ARE DEAD ALREADY !!I couldn't wait. They spoiled enough blood.  WTF, I already did. Look at my sig, genius.And that is NOT what I am talking about. I am actually criticising piotr_n for coming to this thread and complaining, instead of coding it himself. And (as he confirmed himself) he could actually do it, he just does not care.I cannot code CoinJoin anyway, too complex for my skill level. Ok then, so you prefer to sit and wait for someone to do it for you.WowSo lazinessMuch not giving fuckSuch a shameWow Piotr_n, you seem to be an intelligent and experienced low level (C++ or lower) programmer.Wouldn't it suit you better simply to write your own CoinJoin implementation instead of just talking about it ? After studying your posts on these forums, I am fairly certain that you have the skill. The question is, whether you want to do something with it, or just keep discussing the topic ? Not bad. But what about bitswap.io ?Anyway, at this point in the project development (almost) any name you choose will be OK. People will simply get used to it and with time they will associate the name with the function it created. So i guess we need this (and CoinSwap/CoinJoin/CoinControl) in reference client ASAP ? Would it be difficult to do ? Well, in the EU we have the "Cyprus business" (HINT: EU plans to allow the Cyprus way in any country), so that wasn't very lucky comparison.  By normal wire perhaps ? Wires aren't blocked AFAIK. Only direct deposits.Collateral can obviously depend on the trust level between participants and other parameters/circumstances. After preliminary analysis, this idea seems pretty amazing !Who needs Ripple, when you have Bitcoin ! O_O. Truly epic. I wonder...- Is the author even maintaining/supporting this project in any way ?- Does this thing even work ?- Why did first post get deleted ?And NO, i do not want to read-through all hundereds of posts to find this out. Zerocoin is also cool, but CoinJoin + Coinswap should theoretically provide the same thing without unnecessary bloat.Anyway - the more, the better. We need competition in everything.I dream about living in voluntaristic or semi-voluntaristic society, where you won't have to pay taxes if you don't want to (however most people still will pay taxes, but because they **WANT TO**, not they are **FORCED TO**). Freedom FTW. Then they probably weren't very smart.And DPR was a complete and utter idiot.Both of them (and especially charlie) were a public persons, so they should be more careful of what they do publicly. Enough of this foolish conformist bullshit.We can use CoinJoin, CoinSwap, CoinControl.We can use GPG.We can use Truecrypt.If you let them read your email and steal your money, that's just your choice. They cannot force anybody to give up their Bitcoins. They cannot even prove that (careful)somebody has Bitcoins. * ShadowOfHarbringer is watching this. * ShadowOfHarbringer is watching this.
2014-01-26 Update:NFTF - version 0.8.6 released.Fresh tag - nftf-v0.8.6 is avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsMASTER branch was updated to the last tag (0.8.6). Well, it would seem i have to retest my fork for these new conditions.For now, i will keep updating. When majority is already using new rules, i will check if there is a point in continuing my fork. Hahahahahaha Splendid post, milord ! Exactly.I wonder how were this guys not marked as SCAMMERS in the first place. This page has invalid SSL certificate. Can you copy/paste the certificate fingerprint, so I can add it to permanent exceptions ? One of the better SciFi shows running currently, actually. The ratings (8.4) also confirm that.However it is too close to reality for me, so i watch it lazily. But that's just me - I like SciFi Series which do not resemble current reality. What I am worried about is that the relaying nodes (not mining nodes) will keep broadcasting the transaction forever, and thus - it will be stuck in a limbo.However you should be able to fix such transaction using Raw Transactions API by rebroadcasting it with a (larger) fee.Somebody with greater knowledge of Bitcoin-QT code should step in here to clarify that. This is not what i referred to.I refrerred to the part of your answer which stated that "it worries you that i don't know that there is no chance of losing coins".Sure I don't know, because I have not studied the Bitcoin-QT code in detail - I didn't need that in order to create my fork.Are you sure about that ? Won't some other nodes keep relaying the transaction so it will be forever stuck in a limbo ?Is there a time limit for how long a transaction can be kept in memory before it becomes obsolete & is removed ?[Citation needed] Actually i would like to see a citation (or a snippet of code) for that. I don't have time to study the whole code. Ask the core Bitcoin developers. The code which asks you for a fee in that case has not been changed in my fork.This fork is merely 3 lines of code which turn off a single limitation which forces you to pay a fee even when it is not absolutely necessary. That is not rocket science. TO THE SUN ! I join the question. Please format the date accordingly, non-americans can't read shit like "12-31-13".PS.When are you Americans going to adopt proper metric, weight & date/time systems like rest of the goddamn civilized world ? Yep, it takes longer but it works. That is the exact reason I've built this fork - because i think that the default algo sucks donkey's balls as it requires fee for coins that could be easily sent without. Actually, it will never be a problem because modern computing technology is still extremely inefficient and there are no signs that it will improve anytime soon.Most of the power (I don't remember exact numbers, but it is at least 75% or more) that CPUs/ASICs use is still wasted as heat.So we can use the heat produced by CPUs, GPUs and ASICs to heat our buildings.Problem solved. NEXT, PLEASE ! Just use a Linux LiveCD to access the USB stick, and be done with it.Next ! There can be multiple reasons. Like:- You have received money from a lot of inputs- The coins do not have enough confirmationsFYI, this fork does not remove fees completely, it only relaxes the fee requirement algorithm. If it does not allow you to send without fee, probably very high risk of losing the coins exists. You can still send them using RAW transactions API, but i wouldn't go for it if I was you.Also, recheck 3 times if you are using binary built from my code. You may be using other binary. Why is this thread in "Bitcoin -> Bitcoin" instead of in "Speculation" or "Bullshit" sections ? Hmmm... * ShadowOfHarbringer is watching this. Yep, already done. Several times.But (obviously) stop Bitcoin client first.
Already done. So you can't be remembered as such, because somebody already did it (or will do it soon) ! Do you get the logic ?CoinSwap. CoinJoin. CoinControl. ZeroCoin. BlockChain info's CoinJoin implementation.Hello ? Sergio ? You there ? Actually since CoinControl, CoinSwap, CoinJoin and even ZeroCoin are already coming i think that your invention is not so of a big deal anymore.However obviously everybody would surely welcome yet another way(tm) to anonymize their wealth.EDIT:What I meant to say was that releasing it today would not mean much because we soon will have other means of gaining complete financial privacy. This could be the next revolution.The blockchain could become 1000x smaller making it possible to run full nodes in low-power devices. I mean, that would be something. Nothing needs to be done really except improving Bitcoin clients & websites so Bitcoin becomes more scalable, easy to use, secure and anonymous.If we do so, it will just happen. This is an unstoppable force of nature (or force of mathematics). Well, this is not strictly Bitcoin article, but related. Also, some Bitcoin in comments below the articlehttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-20/pboc-says-no-longer-in-china-s-favor-to-boost-record-reserves.html Honourable member of Staff, we welcome you !Any idea if we could have outgoing link verification on these forums ? (You know, it would really help to mitigate attacks like this one) Oh, I think that nobody outside the foundation trusts or likes him anymore. Oh, please. This belongs in the Speculation section. Would you care to elaborate ? Zerocoin is pretty complicated comparing to the Bitcoin alternatives: CoinJoin, CoinSwap and CoinControl which offer practically the same functionality.I don't think we need ZeroCoin anymore. Yep, it's that easy to get scammed.One misclick and your account is fucked (then scammer can use your verified & trusted account to send even more scammy PMs). Actually, wrong aaaand... WRONG again.What about CoinControl, CoinJoin and Coinswap ? The first one is being merged into Bitcoin-QT, second is being worked on and avaiable already at blockchain.info's wallet, and third is at the concept stage.These are all new ideas, give it time.Actually AFAIK for now it's just Mike Hearn from core devs, do you have proof that other core devs are also working on it ? Look at the PM I just received :[ WARNING FOR NOOBS: DO NOT CLICK THAT LINK BELOW ! ]This is a scammer, trying to harvest Bitcointalk forum's logins & passwords. We should act immediately - perhaps an automatic external linking protection (like youtube) or tagging algorithm adding extra description to every outgoing link (like slashdot) should be added to the forum.Algorithm such as this is easy to write and will save many noobs and people who misclick and don't read website URL's.Also: Somebody please ban this motherfucker (and others like him) before they do a lot of harm. Exactly - this is my whole point. Why keep the "main"/"original" Foundation in the Fucked up Country like USA is ?If we are going to have "the" Foundation, let's have it in the best country in the world for such things - Switzerland. Obviously.Some "groups" have concluded that Bitcoin will go mainstream and it has to be controlled before it can harm their business and powers. Of course it is not 100% neutral. But Close Enough(tm).Sorry, can't change the poll now, the results would be invalid. Nobody is saying that there should be only one foundation.I'm talking about moving this one to Switzerland, because USA is a country fucked up beyond repair (as many many other to be fair). No need to rush into any altcoins, a simple hard fork is all we need. I have just read some of this crap. It is really disgusting.People like that should not have the power to represent or decide ANYTHING in Bitcoin. Mike should be kicked out of the foundation immediately and the foundation should be moved to Switzerland in order to remove pro-government lobbying & political pressure (if that even helps - but after reading I doubt it). Already donated.
Q: Do you want to see Coin Validation implemented? Quoted For Awesomness.Well said, sir. @gmaxwellWHERE IS THE DONATION ADDRESS I WANT TO THROW SOME COINS AT YOU !!!!!!!!11111ONEONE.----(But seriously, give us a donation addr) + 1000Also, if shit-listing ever happens, I am here to fork it. There needs to be a bridge (or multiple bridges) between the Bitcoin distributed/decentralized world and the "normal" world, because the normal one is not decentralized.Foundation should mainly lobby & collect funds for the development of Bitcoin, NOT DECIDE anything.This only shows that the current "foundation" has gone wrong. In light of recent [1] events [2] (namely a member of Bitcoin Fundation suggesting that we should diffrentiate between "Good Bitcoins" and "Bad Bitcoins"), it becomes more and more obvious that the worst enemy of Bitcoin is the Bitcoin Foundation:There are probably strong political pressures from USA which not only has very aggressive AML policies, but clearly is going in the direction of Fascism and Socialism while becoming more and more anti-democratic.So what is the point of keeping Bitcoin Foundation in a country which is (or will be soon) an enemy of Bitcoin ?Perhaps a truly democratic country should be used, such as Switzerland.What do you think ? Then any (such) government is unacceptable to us.Times change, governments will have to either adapt, die or be ignored by the population until they accept the inevitable. If that happens, then...OH BABY, I'M SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GONNA FORK IT AGAIN ! Exactly what I am talking about.We must make coin mixing almost as common as sending them. This way governments will have no choice but face the reality. Another option is to make CoinJoin/CoinSwap really popular. Perhaps make the client suggest mixing like by adding "mix coins with other's users coin" checkbox in the send coins GUI.This way regulators will have no other way than to accept Bitcoin the way it is - mixed and untraceable. Apparently people are plotting behind the scenes to put whitelisting, blacklisting and redlisting and other terrible ideas into Bitcoin.Perhaps we should seriously speed up initiatives like CoinJoin, CoinSwap and CoinControl so people start massively mixing coins and make such efforts unfeasible. This is definately a direct attack on the bare basic fundamentals of Bitcoin.We need to stop it. NOW. Oh man, I'm sooooooo supporting you. If any kind of blacklist or redlist ever happens i will definately create a fork of Bitcoin without the blacklist.I already created and maintain one, so no problem with that there. Yeah that crash was terrible ! OMG ! Bitcoin is definately doomed !I suggest everybody sell their Bitcoins to me immediately for $50 each. I will fix your Bitcoin problems ! You are talking bullshit (as usual I guess - hence the high ignore ratio ?).As of today, world is **not** decentralized or distributed like Bitcoin. So it is obvious that a bridge between the two worlds is necessary.If the bridge we have is a good bridge is a matter for another discussion. But I myself am satisfied with it. For now. This topic clearly belongs in the Speculation section I am thinking for sure Bitcoin could be the beginning of economy based on smart and really meaningful investments.Inflationary economy = You have to spend or you lose, no choice = A lot of STUPID investmentsDeflationary economy = You are not forced to do anything with your money = A lot of SMART investments (people will not waste their money needlesly on stupid ideas because they can earn just by holding them)  [sarcasm]Yeah, that sounds pretty simple.[/sarcasm]Do I also have to perform a blood ritual in order to transfer my soul to the ripple d(a)emon ?PS.No, seriously. That does not sound simple at all. Comparing to simplicity of sending Litecoins from one account to another, this is sounds like crap.What improvement does Ripple bring over Litecoin ? I still can't grasp the concept.
Professional shellfish with delivery, always on time ! Wouldn't it be better for exchanges to adapt Litecoin instead and use that to move funds ? Which version will include support for this feature ? ...not even saying that value would skyrocket by 1000% in a day... or week maybe ? +1Again, +1 QFT. Rich Imbecile Association of America Oh, didn't you know ?Everybody here is running their own version of Silkroad. Havent you heard ? That's what Bitcoin is all about !!!!!!!!1111111111oneoneoneevelen[/NSA/FBI/CIA/ECHELON/PRISM Trolling mode OFF] Don't mistake paranoia with rational thinking.Of course feds are all over the forums. Haven't you read the story of Silkroad ? How they got to the guy running it ?They found one of his veeeeeeeeeeeeeery old topics on this forum and followed the trail further.It would be just moronic/extremely naive to think that feds are not all over the forum after Silkroad case. Obviously they are around. Maybe even in this very topic, who knows. Future will tell if that protocol will be useful, however I am afraid you are right (for now i have completely no idea what I could use it for). This is why i said "IF you were wrong".FYI, I am only moderately paranoid. But in the light of recent NSA-snowden stuff, I think that is completely justified... @gmaxwell, @Gavin Andresen, @Mike HearnI have run out of time and Brain-CPU cycles that can be used for this particular discussion, but judging by preliminary analysis of the topic I will (logically) assume you are right.However i will be closely watching the run of events - If you were wrong, the truth will come out eventually. Actually there is an easy solution for it.There is a minimal version of openssl targetted specifically for low-power embedded devices: cyasslYou are obviously a low-level programmer, so stop wasting time on the forums and perhaps make Bitcoin compatibile with it. Point taken, however this makes the possible ramifications even worse.Because the implementation is so efficient and bloat-free, the risk of it becoming "standard" way of doing transactions in the future is even bigger.So as I already wrote, 15 years from now it may not be possible to buy something using Bitcoin without trusting some CA, which are controlled by government.But well, if using PKI stays optional, then I think I can live with that. Still, I hope most people will not be using this broken (as of today) functionality. But there were several mentions of alternative ways to mitigate MITM problem in this very thread. Is none of them valid ? (I will cite the previous mentions from this thread):- "Rivest's Interlock Protocol can prevent a man in the middle from altering your communications while allowing you to communicate at all.  At most, he is then reduced to an eavesdropper or able to engage a denial-of-service attack".- "Bitcoin already has a solid public key infrastructure in that each and every coin is controlled by a public/private key pair.  If you know who owns a coin, you can compose a message to them and encrypt it using that coin's public key".- "ZRTP: For people seeking trustless key exchange algorithm: it has been already invented (i.e. you can avoid MITM attack without relying on PKI) - ZRTP could be easily adapted to bitcoin payments, changing SAS authentication string to PIN , for example, as it can be only 16 bit number. However, you would have to trust the merchant not to scam you".1. This is not an excuse. Just because some part of Bitcoin is already centralized, should we make it even more centralized thus breaking it even more ? Where's the logic in that ?2. There are decentralized pools (p2pool and such), just not many people are currently using it.So mining is or at least *can be* decentralized.----Other than above, no more questions for now. Can somebody quote my questions, please ?Gavin probably has me on his ignore list again. And i really want my questions answered. @GavinI tried to be as constructive & reasonable as possible (and no shouting/emphasing/whatever). I am getting any of my questions answered ?Once again, the questions were: @Gavin AndresenI'm not shouting anymore, but I am still humbly awaiting for your answers to my questions, please. I am not in a hurry, however I am also afraid I won't receive them at all. @Gavin AndresenSeveral questions:1. In the post-NSA-snowden era, are you sure it is wise to participate in creation of a centralized mechanism, which governments can easily control ? Why would we trust *any* CA ?2. What would Satoshi think of this ? Isn't adding a centralized stuff to a decentralized-by-design system kind of senseless ?3. How do you think will the tinfoil-hatted-extremely-paranoid Bitcoin community react, when they realize you added a broken by design schema to the most important Bitcoin app ?4. What problem exactly  are you trying to solve with this solution ? I don't see Bitpay, Inpay, Coinbase or others complain that they cannot do business using Bitcoin without this feature ? Isn't the invoicing possible to do through third party app or in-browser using SSL ? 5. Why add such a non-critical feature to the core client ? Isn't it supposed to be as clean, fast and efficient as possible without unnecessary bloat ?  I'M GLAD YOU LOVE IT, I WORKED SO HARD ON IT !!!!!1111111oneone----But seriously, i do love to emphase important parts of my posts.
SERIOUSLY, GUYS.One question:Devs, did you anticipate that in the future their new CA-Based centralized protocol may become the standard of doing Bitcoin payments ?And then NSA/USA Govt/World govt/whatever can actually seize the CA and decide who can do business with whom ?I guess that by the time I'm writing this, governments of the world already figured out that Bitcoin cannot be stopped using the easy "conventional" methods. So they may(or rather WILL) try to embrace, extend and extinguish Bitcoin. 1. First by making it centralized, 2. second by promoting the centralized way of doing transactions, 3.  third attacking the single point of failure, thus ending it.You are just in the process of helping them with the step 2. +1000Well, i never thought i would agree with you on something, but it just happened.Adding any kind of "trusted" "root" servers to Bitcoin core totally negates the decentralized nature of the currency. What if in some time, everybody starts to build their buisness solutions of top of this OBVIOUSLY BROKEN centralized scheme and 20 years in the future Bitcoin will turn into another shit like central banks because certificate authorities will control who can and who can't do Bitcoin-related buisness ?+ 1000Adding "trusted" certificates of CENTRALIZED entities into Bitcoin code ? I mean *WTF* ? I have just found time to read this post thoughtfully, and...Mother of Hash... Another genius invention.I mean how brilliant can the Bitcoin community be ? I am now convinced that most (if not all) of current humanity's problems can be solved by genius mathematical algorithms.PS.I wonder if this couldn't somehow be used in file sharing by the way ? Nothing except specialized services can protect you from 100Gbps attack if your normal connection is only 1Gbps.It simply overfloods the pipe - it works in the same manner as water. When attackers use up all your bandwidth, nothing is left for the normal traffic. This may be some serious shit.I am pushing this to another forum.Hm, the name rings a bell BTW.If they are making moves like this, something may be in the air. There is no such thing as "intellectual property".It is an artificial theoretical creation by the rich and powerful to keep their monopoly, thwart progress, establish censorship and make poor people poorer and unhappy.----I just LOVE this McAffee guy (though he may be little crazy). We should really give "idiot of the year" badges to everybody who voted "Yes" and the topic author.It would be so much easier to populate ignore lists later without wasting time for discussion. Positive, but not because of closing of Silkroad itself.The guy who was running it was an idiot, a total asshole and a hardcore criminal (he attempted to assasinate somebody). He deserved everything that came his way.I'm only sorry for some of the poor dealers who are simply delivering goods that people want, I see nothing wrong with this. 2013-10-07 Update:NFTF - versions 0.8.4, 0.8.5 released.Fresh tag - nftf-v0.8.4, nftf-v0.8.5 is avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsMASTER branch was also updated to latest Bitcoin version:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftfEDIT: Sorry, mistake. I did not update master this time. So for practical usage it has not yet been really achieved. That's what i wanted to say.Anyway, it would be extremely cool to have homomorphic encryption as it would enable ultimate blockchain compression (there was a topic here claiming that). I did see the article on wikipedia, and it says that full homomorphic encryption is a scientists' wet dream and it has never been achieved.  Wait a moment.Wasn't homomorphic encryption a theoretical academic thing that has not been proved to even exist (or be possible to perform) yet ?Correct me if I am wrong here, please. Soon. In progress. Quite obviously.Bitstamp should actually care (it is in their best interest) whether they are displayed on BitcoinCharts, so they would (probably) unban BCharts if they could...  This may one day become a historical quote. I think I will print it out using big letters and glue it above the screen of my computer. Whatever works for you.I am happy I can be of service. I am finished with the discussion, I already know the answer. It seem more and more likely that they are bunch of manipulative motherfuckers.Somebody prove me wrong please.
So now that MtGox owns bitcoincharts, they purposedly removed their greatest competitor (bitstamp) from the list.I'm glad they are showing their real face (unless this is some technical malfunction of course). Whatever, still waiting for a real source.EDIT:Wrong, this seems to qualify as a source:Code:[quote]DOMAIN: BITCOINCHARTS.COM    RSP: KalyHost  URL: http://www.kalyhost.com/    created-date: 2010-11-08 02:11:21  updated-date: 2013-06-13 09:00:02  registration-expiration-date: 2014-11-08 02:11:21    owner-organization: K.K.

Don't forget that the Internet and TOR were also started by the US military.Just the fact that they did something does not mean that they still have control over it.Flaws in one of most widely used algos would be quickly found by NSA's/USA enemies - such as China and Russia (Russia/China have some of the world brightest mathematicans & cryptographers).Especially after the Prism scandal.Hiding something like this is simply not possible in after-Prism paranoia world. UPDATE:What i actually meant to say was that Ebay may be looking for *justification* for implementing Bitcoin, I was just missing the word. They tried to contain their enthusiasm, but I would still say this is rather more positive than negative.Seems like ebay wants to hop on the Bitcoin bandwagon and is looking for support or explantation in case somebody (like government or stockholders) asks them "why did you go into Bitcoins ?". It may be possible, but i very seriously doubt they can make it before end of December.This miner is not for average Joe. Its for companies, organizations and wealthy people. Wow, that was unexpectedly fast. "Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety"- Benjamin FranklinAlso, this idea is unfeasible when you create new address for each payment.  Hey, is Tradehill even *ALIVE* ?Why aren't they visible on Bitcoincharts ? No amount of guns / soldiers will destroy Bitcoin (or any, for that matter) code.Even in a completely totalitarian state, you still can't guarantee that there isn't a single copy of some code (or some writing/some data generally) in existence.You can murder people, harass them, blackmail them, terrorize them - none of these things work. And it has been already tried many times thorough the history.I hope this is the kind of answer you expected. If you treat your security seriously, you simply don't use windows for important tasks.Windows is useful for me as a gaming machine, but i wouldn't dare run Bitcoin on it... @gmaxwellI'm saluting to the unquestionalble genius of you and (almost ?) everybody else in this community.Do you have any plans to start working on this feature soon ?EDIT:OK i read your post completely and appears that you are not.  This may be the most fucking brilliant idea i have seen since the dawn of proof-of-work (or sliced bread), however I am obviously too stupid to verify if that will work or if that is even possible. 2013-08-19 Update:NFTF - version 0.8.3 released.Fresh tag - nftf-v0.8.3 is avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsMASTER branch was also updated to latest Bitcoin version:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf

Unless you pay in cash. This problem has been already solved by somebody.http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/plausible-deniabilityNow they have to prove that you have a wallet at all first. In short, Karma is a Bitch, Vice(b)oy. I already accomplished it.This thread is enough evidence that you are a manipulative, hypocritical motherfucker. For now it seems the biggest liar & manipulator in this topic is you.So perhaps you should shut up and get some humility. Trolling ? No.Spreading some propaganda ? Yes, why not. That is possible. "Why Internet will never reach mainstream". So basically you created another ZeroCoin, but working using obfuscation technique and easier to perform (without requiring a lot of code) ?Is this brilliant or what ? Ad personam again. How old are you ? 13 ?I will not even comment on this.Discussion with blockheads is a waste of time. I'm going to sleep now. Bye. Of course you did attack me. The fact that you don't even understand this speaks further against you.You didn't attack the argument. You attacked me. That is why it is called "ad personam", smartass. Just so you all know, Viceroy just removed another post of myself from his thread: Oh yeah, the "ad personam" argument. Great.Apparently you just lost the discussion. Also, results of the poll agree with me.BTW,If you haven't noticed, my topic is **NOT self moderated**, so at least I am letting you speak. That says something.PS.Listen kid, I really don't have time for this. List of my other posts in Viceroy's thread removed by him, for evidence:1. 2. This is a reply to "Is TradeFortress breaking the law?" topic. I started a new one, because Viceroy (in my opinion) is an outright coward afraid of the truth and logical reasoning.He obviously made the topic a self-moderated one. Why make a poll self-moderated if you want to know the _REAL_ opinions of other people ? I mean what the hell ?Also, check out the post of mine he deleted from his thread:And his reply: What does this have to do with anything ?Ripple is a scam anyway (unless they stop lying and prove otherwise), the evidence is everywhere, whether TradeFortress is a criminal or not. Just write the damn dates in the correct format and stop talking bullshit.If the dates are not in the correct format, this subforum quickly becomes totally unreadable. We want clarity so that in the future it is easier to see the succession of events. I had just the same thought.But once coin control is incorporated in the mainline client, this no longer will be a problem. Then you will be able to select which exactly coins you send to what address. +1This is great news.
Surely, I admit they suck a little, but you are overexaggerating.I've seen worse. Yeah, go for it. Hmmm.... Absolutely wonderful.However, is there a chance we will be seeing this in the default client ?Or will everybody who wants to use this channels be forced to use bitcoinj ? Confirmed. Coin control.  Country: PolandVote: Against Seems like a modern-day honeypot to me, but only time will tell, I guess. At first, somebody bought a Bitcoin for fun, because it was cool & nerdy/geeky thing to do.But once the man realized what he bought has real value, he didn't want to sell it so cheap - so the price rose.There you have it - the beginnings of free market. Looks like a honeypot to me, but only time will tell...  Nope.- Chain is not forked- Transaction relaying is unaffected- Everything except amount of fees when sending **your own money** is unaffectedThis is a minor patch, nearly identical to official client.You can simply send money paying less fees, but with higher risk of transaction not making it into a block (fees might not be enough).I created this fork, because i didn't like the decision of the devs to raise fees some time ago without giving user any choice (a configuration option for God's sake !).  You are a guy in a tinfoil hat. Again.Thanks to code analysis tools (and there are many powerful, free & extremely expensive commercial ones) plus git, such a mistake can be easily spotted.Remember that you don't review whole code at once (large). You just review latest changes (small).There are many smart (and i even dare to say: genius) people looking for backdoors in the Bitcoin code , so that wouldn't be very smart to add backdoors, even if you are a genius yourself. This sounds **marvellous** !Where do i sign up ? My thougths are whether you are some retarded kid who thinks he can do monies now.I mean, seriously, this is not funny. 2013-06-23 Update:NFTF - version 0.8.2 released.Fresh tag - nftf-v0.8.2 is avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsPLEASE NOTE THAT UNTIL MAX BLOCK SIZE PROBLEM HAS BEEN SOLVED BY DEVELOPERS, SOME FREE (WITHOUT FEE) TRANSACTIONS CREATED BY THIS FORK MAY CONFIRM VERY SLOWLY OR NEVER.PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING BEFORE USING THIS FORK.

I do not understand this...
It will not work on everybody. It will not work always.EDIT:Actually the wiki article you have given says that always-working truth serum does not exist.Read first before you copy paste. First they have to prove you do own any Bitcoins at all.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniabilityhttp://www.truecrypt.org/docs/plausible-deniability Well, we were waiting for it since the dawn of Bitcoin. I don't really think people will be too surprised here.It would be more surprising & unexpected if they didn't try to fight us. It will work with everything that the mainline client works with.Well, except paying more fees of course. 2013-06-11, not 2013-6-11  Is this stable enough for everyday usage ?I'm considering installing it. Rubber hose is useless if they cannot prove that the data is there.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniabilityhttp://www.truecrypt.org/http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=plausible-deniability Awesome post, DeathAndTaxes. Thank you. Want decentralization ? Use P2Pool. Convince other people to use P2Pool. This one has not been confirmed.And thousands people probably already looked at the code, because the case is like what 5 ? 10 ? years old ? Oh, you were serious.For "what i know", check links in my signature.This topic has been discussed so many times...In short:- Ripple is not either open source or decentralized- Their website lies about the truthNo more "truths" i know. About Joel's wife ? A lot, I bet more than he knows himself. No, but i beat yours, and man - she likes it.So are we going to start insulting each other instead of just discussing on the topic ? Schizophrenia tends to do that.He probably thinks he is 2 different people simultaneously. The hashing majority will have another choice. If they don't like the changes, they will not upgrade their clients to new version !But right now it seems most of people, EXCLUDING YOU is supporting the change.What the hell are you talking about ?What have you been smoking ?Where have you been the last 6 months ?Yes, this issue has been discussed for AT LEAST 6 MONTHS. This is not "some decision done on the desert of LA", dumbass.Please, stop wasting our time with this pointless discussion. All of your arguments have been proven to be wrong.  Then you believe it is just "OK" to lie in that manner to get more people in the project ? +1Also, banning of ALL ENCRYPTED TRAFFIC by ALL GOVERNMENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY ?I would say the probability of this is almost astronomically small, like < 0.0000001.You can't get all governments to agree on probably any topic you want (choose one at random) and piotr_n would like us to believe that all of them will agree on such an important issue ? Quite correct.Exactly as it is wit Bittorrent, creating an effective law against Bitcoin connections/nodes will require cooperation of EVERY GOVERNMENT IN THE DAMN WORLD (because internet is by its nature decentralized).And that will never happen and has never, ever happened in history. So yes, amincd's argument is correct.The only other thing that can be done technically is shutting down the Internet.Actually "they" would like very much to shut down the Internet, as this video shows:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct9xzXUQLuYBut "they" CAN'T. Too bad, I almost feel sorry for "them". Wery well, but first i need to find it...EDIT:I checked all of your posts in this topic and it is not there. Please point me in the right direction. 
* ShadowOfHarbringer is watching this. We are back to the essential/contentwise discussion already (I'm done insulting piotr_n), so i don't understand what are you talking about. Exactly - maybe he knows about pruning, but he chooses to forget just to keep the discussion going.That's what i hate about some people - they choose to IGNORE SOME ARGUMENTS so they can "win" the discussion (or at least they think so). WTF. Stop right there.You clearly know nothing about anything. Have you heard of pruning ? If not, please educate yourself and come back here.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalabilityhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=10663.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=88208.0When pruning is implemented, the only thing you need to run full node is a fast internet connection which is ALREADY CHEAP in many countries and will be WAAAAAYY cheaper in a few years. Then we will run nodes: - On I2P, TOR- On Mesh networks- On dedicated servers in countries that don't care about U.S. law- In rented apartments/basements with fast internet connections in different countriesPossibilities are endless.Of course they would... if they could.For now, they cannot even stop Bittorrent/P2P and you expect them to stop Bitcoin ? Please... Actually, one more argument:- Huge, full Bitcoin nodes can be run on dedicated servers in different countries. The servers are now extremely cheap and will be getting cheaper every year. You don't even understand what I am talking about and you apparently know shit about the protocol.Obviously, transactions are CURRENTLY free only for "old" coins that haven't been moved in a long time and only until there is a block reward. When the block reward stops 100 years from now, transaction fees will be the only thing that keeps mining profitable - so there will be no free transactions anymore.And how do you make transactions free forever with today's Bitcoin protocol ? That is impossible and that is NOT what i meant.Just how did you come to the conclusion that free transactions = centralized infrastructure ?Arguments:- Huge nodes can be run on I2P and perhaps TOR.- Huge nodes can be run on Mesh networks.- If Bitcoin becomes really mainstream, huge nodes will be run by companies/corporations, academies, governmentsAre you assuming that Bitcoin will be a geek - only currency forever ? If that is so, then centralization will not be a problem, because there will not be any scalability problem.Logically:- If Bitcoin does not become mainstream => Scalability is not a problem anyway (little amount of transactions = low bandwidth/storage requirements)- If Bitcoin becomes mainstream => scalability is not a problem, because governments, companies & academies will be running big nodes.So your logic is fatally flawed. 1. I don't really have time to go through the whole topic - sorry. So please tell me which of these propositions you think should replace the increase of block size.2. Transactions are supposed to be free - that is the foundation of Bitcoin. That is how Satoshi envisioned it. He also said very clearly that the block size limit is a temporary measure to protect the network from DDoS.The way i see things is that you want do a hard fork and completely change the basics of Bitcoin instead of doing the thing that is natural and already designed by Satoshi - increasing the block size. And i think that is one hell of a dumb idea.Why create a new untested solution when we already have a solution ? Wait a moment.So what are the OTHER safe & reliable methods of "addressing scalability issue" without increasing the block size ?What are the other propositions ? And I mean ones that do not require re-writing whole protocol from scratch, by the way.If you are criticizing this way, you need to provide **an alternative**. Hey Joel, let me understand something. Why all the lies ?Why don't you just update the site and wiki so it reflects **the truth** ? That would shut the mouths of all critics.I mean WTF ? Is that really so damn difficult ? This has nothing to do with trolling.I am making a pure ad hominem argument that you are a very impolite person and also an imbecile with stupid arguments so nobody should listen to anything you have to say.Still on topic.Sorry for that, I usually lose my control when somebody is an über-asshole.He deserved it anyway.By the way, my condolences. Hey, piotr_n, I have prepared something for you:Don't be silly. She was a bitch anyway.Raped ? Don't be silly, everybody knows she fucked everybody around. She liked it and she wanted it.Don't be silly, I know your neighbour and he is a cool person ! I am sure that it was your dog that was mad.Don't be silly, that car was crap anyway.Do you like it ? "Don't be silly" is simply not a proper way to reply to somebody whose a person in the family has recently died.You must be a sick piece of bastard (or a psychopath) if you don't know that. Now you are just being a rude son of a bitch (not a troll).Step down with your tone or GTFO, motherfucker. I will not be having a discussion with such a bastard.And I mean, seriously - no trolling. Nobody is trolling here, seriously. We are just pointing out that your arguments are idiotic. That is not the topic of the discussion, so i ignored it as offtopic. The funny thing is I don't even remember being angry in the last 72 hours...Well, I guess that jdillon knows better what i feel then. Well perhaps there could be a configuration settings in the normal(non-miners) clients for that too.So then we could threaten miners that we won't accept/relay/confirm their blocks if they don't comply with our demands. Actually, no. Individual miners have freedom to choose a pool which suits their interests better or simply use the P2P pool.OR start a new pool and convince enough people to use it. Only $1000 ?I'm not selling to them for less than $10.000 !
+n, n->∞I actually was under the impression that we are libertarians here and we should push for any solution that decreases centralization.No block size limit = free market decides the proper sizeBlock size limit = central planningCentral planning never works and is bad. Aren't 300+ million casualties of communism enough to prove that ? Well, good luck with that. Completely agreed.However it will be difficult for me (and many people) to switch, as I am used to BTC. But I will try to adapt. For an experienced programmer who reviews Bitcoin code on a daily basis it should be trivial to spot such a backdoor.Git is such an extremely powerful tool to review exactly who does what and when. It will be almost unfeasible to put a backdoor in Bitcoin, currently. Correct link:http://www.coindesk.com/top-5-bitcoin-tweets-for-may-27-to-june-2/ This is not a problem, really.Dedicated servers are so cheap these days you can easily set up a machine in a random country.Check this out:http://www.ovh.co.uk/dedicated_servers/REALLY CHEAP. Probably.The question is: will it really happen ? OK, whatever.What ? We are talking about RELIGION now ?Do you actually understand that PEOPLE, not only banks will be able to run full nodes in their basements even if block size is 50MB, right ? So what the hell are you talking about ?As for mining, it is already unfeasible to mine if you are not a specialist with resources anyway and the situation will only get worse - no matter if block limit is 1MB or 100MB. That is also compatibile with definition of freedom.People are free to buy more powerful hardware and internet connections.But freedom does not mean that everybody has to afford it. You are free to work hard & earn money to buy a more powerful computer and more bandwidth. 1000 times this.I know rationing from my personal experience living in a part of the USSR. Imagine standing in line for 6 hours with your mother just to get meat for Christmas... I would advise anybody who does not get what "rationing" means and what it leads to to try that. It should be an enlightening experience.The less centralization & control, the better. Let the market decide. I don't normally like you posts, but this is actually a pretty damn Brilliant idea.However the forum should not be called "Scam coins", but "Untested / Unproved AltCoins". Seriously ? I always thought they pay you for writing these stupid posts.OMG.Who cares what you believe ?The FACT (not belief) is that they can(being centrally controlled & closed source) ISSUE AS MANY XRPs as they want AT ANY TIME they want.Correct - you are seriously working for the scammy opencoin bastards.  Kiba NEEDs moderation rights in this forum ! Please stop calling me "friend". I am not your friend. QFT. I'm not talking to myself. I am talking because that increases the probability of reversing effects of your stupid propaganda. Yes - let's just assume you have no arguments and that you are wrong. And then we can stop.And what is the threat, exactly ?Bitcoin full nodes are currently run full time mostly by hobbyists/geeks anyway. So what is the difference ? Bandwidth ?  Like 150 Mbit down / 10Mbit up you can already get in most developed countries ?Computing power ? Like Beowulf cluster you can build at home ? Like Core-I7 ? Dedicated FPGA's ? Extremely powerful Graphics cards ?I don't see ANY PROBLEM AT ALL here.Obviously, soon not everybody will be able to run a full node. It will be a job for geeks, academies, non-profit fundations and companies. And that is completely normal.I, for one will obviously run a full node.Mining is a job for geeks/nerds/hobbyists/companies/institutions and not for average John Smith. Sorry for that. Ok sorry - it actually will - my mistake. I actually meant it does not change the "core principles of Bitcoin" like block reward.Why exactly is it "not ready yet" ? Last time i checked, they even encouraged usage of P2P over I2P.And in a maximum of few years time, mining over TOR will be impossible anyway. 6 transactions per second is simply NOT enough for any serious buisness, so the max block size will be increased anyway. The question is not if, but when and how big will it be. Yes, I actually plan to do that.Few terabytes is not a problem and i think that we will have working tree pruning in the next 5 years.
There is a difference.Change of block reward would create a HARD FORK of Bitcoin. It is the most "sacred" variable of Bitcoin, it cannot be changed without hard forking and disagreement in the community.Changing block size OR default fee will not create a hard fork.And what is stopping you from using a LITE client over an anonymous connection ? Why the hell do you need a FULL client over TOR for ?Also, there is a network which can handle such traffic - I2P.We have (or we will have) tree pruning for that. Not everything has to be stored.And hard drives capacities & internet connections speeds will be improving over the years. These are just variables. Variables can be changed.But the CORE Bitcoin protocol allows ANY number of transactions per second. The only REAL limitation is the speed of the internet connection and TFLOPS of processing power.So why the hell people keep shouting "Bitcoin is not designed for microtransactions" ? This is just a big piece of Über-Bullshit. Oh my, this is so much of Bullshit.You actually mean that the current Bitcoin client is not designed for microtransactions.But future clients may require multiple computers or a cluster to run a single client (like BitsOfProof supernode).It is entirely possible to write a client which will be able to process 100.000 transactions/second with today's technology and internet connections, so why the stupid "BTC is not designed for micro.... blah blah" talking ?WTF is wrong with you people. Obviously, Bitcoin IS DESIGNED FOR MICROTRANSACTIONS. There is NOTHING in the Bitcoin protocol design that would not allow microtransactions. But it does not contain CoinControl. However it is centralized - so it is possible for FED to close it down pretty easily or dilute the XRP supply like they do with dollar. Good work.I will soon release my forked version of this so people can send more free transactions. You clearly have no idea what "Open Source" means."Open source in future" is NOT Open Source. Period.If it were for me to decide, you would be marked as scammer together with Ripple for doing PR for them. That is NOT the definition of Open Source. Bullshit.Which means exactly that it is CURRENTLY centralized.Double Bullshit with Extra Chips.It matters, because they lie about it.Bullshit #3 with extra Onion.But it has "units", which could be counterfeited. For example, by government seizing ripple central servers.4 Bullshits plus cola and mashed potatoes.Does not matter as they claim otherwise on their site.Bullshit #5 with some butter.Who cares. They lie, they profit, they scam. Bullshit #6 with italian pasta and salami.My post is intentionally spreading the truth about the CURRENT STATE of affairs so less people will be scammed by lying Ripple fuckers and their propaganda tubes, like you are.Total bullshits counted: 6Will it be card or cash, sir ? Oh great, another Cripple discussion.Let me just put this here:Dry facts:- Ripple is NOT open source- Ripple is NOT decentralized- Ripple does NOT use "the same underlying cryptography" as Bitcoin- Ripple is NOT counterfeit proof- Ripple CAN PRINT as much XRP as they want (they already did actually).For more, check http://ripplescam.org/ and this topicAlso check out this lies on their website, while you still can.(Yeah, like that GitHub repo is the WHOLE source)Lies, lies lies, lies. Goddamn lies everywhere. Right after BitTorrent  If banks & governments are starting to fight Bitcoin, then this is a good news.It means that Bitcoin REALLY IS a VALID competition to them (if not, then why fight it ?). And if it is a valid competition, that means we can win this.Not like this is a surprise, anyway. We were expecting this since the dawn of Bitcoin. Kiba, please ask admins about moderation rights in the "Press" section.I mean, seriously. Apparently, quite long. I know, I do not believe in "intellectual property". But still, lawyers & governments do.Which has nothing to do with what I was talking about. @ElectricMucusBy the way, you talk bullshit and your signature is complete bullshit. So fitting. Again, [citation needed]. There is nowhere said that you can freely distribute all the code (daemon too, not just client). So you cannot and you have no freedoms RMS talks about.Oh yes they do:(Yeah, like that GitHub repo is the WHOLE source)Lies, lies lies, lies. Goddamn lies everywhere. Sorry, not close enough.Somebody please delete this topic. And that is related to Bitcoin... how ?This topic should be deleted or moved. No. You do not understand what "open source" means. Open Source is not when you get access to the source.Open Source is when AUTHOR publicly states the license it is on, no other way.Otherwise author can always sue you for illegally distributing his intellectual property.For example: there is a lot of people and organizations who have access to Windows source, but Windows is NOT open source. It is NOT the same.Do you actually know what you are talking about ?Because i hate wasting time on people who talk random crap.That's in the future (or one of possible futures). We are here and now - let's talk about the present. That's what I am saying. But they are NOT releasing it yet while claiming to be Open Source. And that is simple scam. This fork builds exactly the same way the normal client does. So just follow instructions on building the mainline client.https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-msw.md
Still not Open Source.So ripple is STILL a scam, because they are STILL lying on their wiki & frontpage !They could stop it any time by removing the lies. But they don't ? Why ? Because that is what scammers do.Actually, yeah. He would say that it is not GPL and therefore does not protect user's freedom. Where is the license information ? This is still NOT open source.If they give you the source, it does not mean it is open. It does not mean you can share it, modify it, redistribute it.They can sue you if you use their code against their guidelines / share it with somebody. I did read some of it and i didn't find it.Show me where it is, please.  Yes. [Citation needed]I'm not seeing any "download" button on their page.EDIT: There is only client under the "source code". Once Ripple comes out of beta and opens their sources i will totally stop accusing them of being scammers and remove all links from my sig (perhaps even edit some of my posts).But the **current** state of affairs is that they are obvious scammers. I don't care about the future. I am saying the **current** truth.If they played fair from the beginning and told only the truth (for example: remove lies from their site & wiki), there would be no problem at all. But they are lying from the very start, just as any petty scammer would do.This is disgusting and unacceptable. How is Bitcoin community supposed to gain public trust if so many swinglers try to bend it to their needs ? Vermin such as Ripple needs to be eradicated. Centralized, *closed source* infrastructure.Fixed That For You. Wow, nice to find this old thread active again. I collected new information so i think can bring huge input to this discussion.Well, i know it looks stupid to answer me myself, but i will give it a try."Ripple is a despicable scam that tries to lure suckers into another FIAT central banking system using lies of being open source and decentralized".I think that nails it.EDIT:That is not the real reason ripple is a scam. Ripple is a scam, because they use lies to get you (and your money) into the game, so they can get more profit. Source ? Last time i checked China happily encouraged people to use Bitcoin on their national propagandist TV. And how is that related to this topic ?If you haven't noticed, my fork takes LESS fees than the standard client.Please discuss this in a thread dedicated to the STANDARD Bitcoin-Qt client, not NFTF client.This topic is for discussion & support for the NFTF client fork. If Ripple guys are lying right from the beginning just to get people in the game (and profit from them), then i would say it is the definition of scam. All of the above. HahahaSpot on. Oh yeah, like they can.This is not 1990's and Microsoft is not a monopoly in digital currencies. They will have to either produce something good or die. The open source/libertarian/cryptoanarchist world will quickly kick their asses if they try something funny. Start a new topic. This is not the right place. Wut ?Seriously, this topic is not related to what you said and this is not a place for such discussion. Please start a new topic and stop derailing this one. Ripple is centralized, closed source and it is not based on "the same underlying crypto" as bitcoin.Everything on their site & wiki is lies. In the Bitcoin world, almost eternity  You new here ? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208183.0Take a look in "Press" section sometimes. Quite obviously.But it shows that Russia, similarly to China also hates dollar and would like to get rid of it (FYI: China propagandist CCTV broadcasted 20+ minutes Bitcoin documentary).This may escalate to a full-scale currency war some day, I'm just saying... Right in the spot.Also, ripple is:- NOT Open Source (lies on site & wiki)- NOT Decentralized (lies on site & wiki)- NOT Based on "the same underlying cryptography as BTC" (lies on site & wiki)- Printable/Inflatable in any amount, at any time by its creatorsFor more, check my signature.
I already said this. Ripple creators are sneaky, scammy bastards.I don't care about the future when/if they open the sources. I care about right now. And as of today Ripple is a centralized, closed source, despicable SCAM. Completely agreed. I am only saying that gmaxwell found this suspicious. It is probably some kind of SCAM, there was a warning on the beginning by a high ranked user (was it grondilu ?).So use this code with care.EDIT: Oh yeah, here it is: Then we should only talk when this happens. Eveything here is a waste of time.For now, they are nothing more than petty liars and scammers. They have to either correct the lies on their website or opensource the project, nothing else will change that. Misunderstanding. I did not call YOU a liar, i called Ripple/OpenCoins liars.There is nothing to argue about. It is either open source now or it isn't. And it isn't so it is logical that IT IS NOT.There is nothing decentralized about ripple if they can CENTRALLY print more XRPs (which they admitted themselves BTW).It is simple logic and you are just wrong. Nothing to argue about at all.Bullshit. As long as there is no open sourced server code, the network can do nothing but accept it.It is not possible to FORK Ripple, so how can the network *NOT* accept it ? Does it have any choice ?The only real choice that is given is to stop using Ripple. What you said is completely irrelevant. The current facts are:- Ripple is NOT open source (lie !)- Ripple is NOT decentralized (lie !)- Ripple does NOT use the same underlying cryptography as Bitcoin (lie !)- Ripple can print any amount of XRP they want at any time (especially if government "asks" them to)Regulators will not kill ripple ? It is EXTREMELY EASY for regulators to kill Ripple. All they need to do is force OpenCoin to inflate ripple into oblivion (or they can just send them to Guantanamo - whichever is easier).Also if current Ripple is closed by government and they actually open the sources, the new - open sourced version will be something completely different (as it will not be centralized). All "old" XRP will probably be lost (because of central point of failure). You better check this out:2013-05-17 China CCTV 13 - Bitcoin  I never asked for it and i didn't get PAID, i got DONATED. It is a significant difference. For once, I didn't ask for it and i put the link in my signature long BEFORE i was paid.I don't sell my views for money, you know because I understand what "honour" means. No, we cannot. I am on topic. The OP was asking why are people producing new Ripple clones when there is original Ripple avaiable. I am answering. It is because RIPPLE IS A SCAM. Period.It is not the same algorithm so it is not "the same crypto". Some (more or less) parts of it are similiar. So this is a lie.I am not really into betting - I do not care. You are not listening. I wasn't saying that Ripple is a threat to Bitcoin anywhere.I just want to warn people so they don't get scammed.I also do not care what Ripple will be in the future, after (if ?) they open the sources. I only care what Ripple is now. And it is a SCAM. Oh, maybe because ripple is a scam ? [check my signature]Also, latest posts of yours are a pretty straightforward proof that you work for them. How much do they pay you per post ?Also, did i mention that RIPPLE IS A SCAM ?. If not, then I am saying it now: RIPPLE IS A SCAM. It is neither "decentralized" or "open source". It also does not base on the same underlying cryptography as Bitcoin. Rules can be also changed at will, and they can print more XRP at will.All the stuff on their site & wiki - It is all bullshit & lies.----In other news: Ripple is a scam. ?? ALREADY ??That was fuckin' fast. OMG, it is happening... BTCBTCBTCBTCBTCBTCBTCBTC I CAN'T BELIEVE IT ! China actually broadcasted this on their fucking NATIONAL PROPAGANDA TV !It is exactly as I predicted (a year ago or so) - Chineese are going to fight dollar with Bitcoin !Do you people understand the R.A.M.I.F.I.C.A.T.I.O.N.S. of this ? This is so huge... practically MIND BLOWING. I guess still better late then never...Yep. They are "frontier" only by name it now seems. Actually, creators of "Star Trek" predicted it.- Tablets- Mobiles- Personal computing- Gadgets (IPad, pocket sensors)However part of that may be a self-fulfilling prophecies as Star Trek inspired people to actually develop these things. Ripple is centralized AND closed source. Out of the frying pan into the fire, yeah. Yeah, and you forgot to add, that since they are centralized (not decentralized as their site & wiki says - outright lie btw), they can print any amount at any given time. Especially if a government tells them to do so.Without decentralization and opening sources they are merely any goverment's bitches, just like today's banks are. @HorseRiderOh - there. See the above ?Told ya. They just won't stop lying. They never do. It's how scammers work. They lie, until they gather enough naive & maniupulated people around their... "project" to scam them. He can not.Their buisness model is based on lying to people to get them in the game (as the rest of scammers do). If that wasn't the case, he would have done it already to cut the speculation, wouldn't he ? Another thing:But that is NOT what they are stating.They are stating (on their page & wiki) that they are OPEN SOURCE and DECENTRALIZED *RIGHT NOW*, not in some distant future.So when they get people to invest money and time to the ripple idea, that is an outright scam. I agree that I may have a troll-ish style of discussion (sorry for that) but I also do have valid arguments (of which almost none was really adressed by JoelKatz).
Doesn't matter - that is not the point.My point is that they are trying to sell their idea to the public while lying about what the idea is really about.I don't care about whether ripple is open or closed. I only care about if it is advertised as such.I disagree.When you first lie to get people into your project and then profit from it - that is already scamming, because people lost their funds and their time to use your fake scammy project. That is already scamming. Well that surely won't be me. I don't use "legacy technologies from twentieth century" as somebody stated on this forums. But their page lists a GitHub account (as if that is the source of entire Ripple) and their wiki says that Ripple is COMPLETELY open source and COMPLETELY decentralized, while that is an outright lie. Don't you get my point ? That is a lie. Lying is what scammers do. Why would I make it easy for a scammer to be polite ? So you can win the discussion and convert more people easily to your scammy idea ? "We're not yet as open as you would like us to be" - this is bullshit.You are lying scamming bastards, that's who you are. Either OpenSource and TRULY decentralize Ripple or you forever will be just that. @JoelKatzYou still don't seem to get it, do you ?Lying on your site & wiki that you are OPEN while you are really CLOSED makes you a SCAMMER already.What else do you want to add ?You scammed me, you scammed everybody who was looking for an answer "what is this whole Ripple thing about ?". They aren't really a competition for Bitcoin... I have another question.If you can inflate XRP at will, what is stopping you from printing additional 200% of current amount of XRP when government "asks" you ?If they offer you a choice: either this or Guantanamo, what will you do ? Will you choose Guantanamo ? Will all of your administrators who control central Ripple servers choose guantanamo ? I'm actually mad because of their insolent lying, not because of the closed source.If somebody want's to do closed source, that is OK with me - I don't have to use it. But if somebody produces something closed and tries to sell it as Open Source, then something is seriously wrong. I for one will not trust any "open" currency which is open only in name.I want to have the sources so i can confirm it does what it does. I will not trust a good word from the producer.Lying on their main site & wiki completely crosses out the whole Ripple thing to me. They are not to be trusted if they LIE from day one, damnit ! Interesting. Website links perhaps ?Sorry, I am in central Europe currently, no plans of going to the US...EDIT:Is that it ?http://bitsofproof.com/ This is a valid scenario, but i was thinking more about scaling the Bitcoin architecture by running multiple identical machines so it could handle tens of thousands or even hundereds of thousands transactions per second.Certainly such scenario is not possible with the "single-client-doing-eveything" way. I wouldn't say the system is very flawed. You need to remember that Bitcoin is still highly experimental.You need to wait a few years to get all the features you want. NFTF fork won't help you with this. Well, it may help get lower fees, but completely getting rid of fees will probably not be possible.NFTF does enforce fees in all cases except of one.Also, what kind of binaries you want (what system) ?It is pretty easy to create binaries for everything except Windows, as there is little difference between NFTF and mainstream client. If creating binaries for mainstream client will work, so will NFTF. Actually you can spend these, but you need to use RAW Tranasctions API.However I do not recommend doing it if you are unexperienced. You also risk losing the money if you don't include enough fees. Miners might include such transaction in a block, but they might not - it will be forever stuck in a transaction "limbo", unless you resend it with enough fees (which is also complicated). So quiet ?I guess there is nothing like this going on then. Little explanation:I didn't mean for you to actually "die", but I am pretty damn angry for cheating me this way nevertheless.You are scammers just for the fact of lying on your site & wiki. I hope you realize that. @JoelKatzLIARS, LIARS, LIARS !!Please do something for me: DIE. Does not matter how many times you address it, your website suggests that it is "open", while it is not - Lie #1.Also, it suggests it is world's first global payment network, while Bitcoin is the first - Lie #2.Even after reading your wiki it was still clear to me that the software is open. So I think it is manipulative on purpose. @JoelKatzAlso your website and wiki are manipulative and spreading misinformation.Before this topic, I was convinced that ripple is completely Open Source (after reading your site & wiki). So i had no problem with Ripple. Now i know the truth. And i know that ripple sucks.
No, but still you are not "open".Source code is not "open", you can do what you want in your closed code and nobody can really control you (except governments of course).Also, because you are not Open Source, governments can shut you down at any given time they want. While much has been said kin this topic and i don't have time to read it(or even skim through it), I can say this:This is FALSE. Big fat lie. (Actually, it's a double lie, because Ripple is neither first payment network or open)Ripple is not open. It falsely suggests that it is by using the "open" word and additionally providing link to an open source repository.This is the end of discussion for me. Ripple is not open. Ripple creators (OpenCoin) are liars. End of story.----BTW, I am happy that somebody finally solved the big "Ripple Mystery" for me. I was wondering what is it for and why the hell would i use it (and for). Now I now I won't because it is a scam.Go OpenTransactions, DIE ripple ! Hey, i was just wondering. Is anybody working on a cluster Bitcoin client yet ? And by "cluster Bitcoin client" I mean:- Works using networked sub-clients, each doing only part of the work (transaction signing / relaying / storing blockchain).- Can be run on multiple machines utilizing all their processors and internet connections- Can use multiple Internet connections at once- Can be run on clusters, supercomputers, beowulfs, server farms etc.Or maybe perhaps it has already been written, but I didn't notice it ? I join the question. Now the situation is different. They don't need any personal skills. 1. They will have a lot of money to vote with their wallets.2. They have the Internet using which they can communicate with other people and shape their minds (already happening)3. They will have companies & lawyers at their disposal so they can push legislation they want. Yeah, they can "be had" because everybody needs money, but that does affect their opinions.Just geeks' opinions on technological matters could change the future (or actually: are already changing).Reason: most people don't understand technology, so they turn to geeks when they seek "guidance". In fact, nope. I was In a hurry and I read without understanding. Sorry for that.You are probably right it seems.However most of you people are so pessimistic that I now regret creating this topic in the first place. It only made me feel worse. So I guess Larry Page & Linus Torvalds also got "exploited easily" ? Is that what you want to say ?Of course, not all of the geeks have to be famous & powerful, but they will vote with their (Bitcoin) wallets, and that is enough. Many IT geeks are already some of the most powerful people on this planet. And there will be more and more of them.Also, many of these new geeks will be cryptoanarchist and/or libertarian - type guys, which do not like to be controlled & manipulated. This is where your theory falls short.But the truth is - only the future will tell for sure. OK, so bad choice of words on my side. I was talking about IT geeks, not nerds in general.I changed the original post to reflect what I actually wanted to express. I think the today's definition of "nerd" is no longer in sync with the dictionary definition. When people today think of "nerd", they visualise an IT, mathematics, physics or other science specialist. @greyhawkMan.Hitler and Napoleon as Geek/Nerd examples ? I Mean, WTF - seriously ? What the hell is wrong with you ?By "geek" or "nerd" i didn't mean people who are bullied at school and later take their anger on the world. I mean enthusiasts who are fascinated by new technology and spend a lot of time developing & upgrading it.Examples:Nikola Tesla, Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, Steve Wozniak, Larry Page, Gavin Andresen, John Carmack, "Valve guys", Oculus Rift guys, young Bill Gates (somewhat). That kind of geeks. Well, history is full of surprises. You don't know anything about me. Don't assume anything.Many people who meet me on daily basis think they know me, yet they don't. The above has nothing to do with any fantasy. I'm just stating the inevitable. If Bitcoin will rule the world, so will geeks.Just look at how much rise of the Internet has raised the geek social status. Bitcoin will increase it 10-fold or 100-fold. Geeks will be the new high-standard which everybody will aspire to.I am not actually producing anything so revolutionary here. Geeks are among the wealthiest people of the world. In my country, geeks are the people who earn the most money already. This is already happening Source ? I don't know, ask them. Please elaborate ? During random discussion it finally occured to me: Nerds & Geeks IT geeks/enthusiasts will rule the world in about the next 20 years. In my opinion, it is practically inevitable. It is now pretty clear few basic technologies will be building blocks of the future and among them the 2 we already know:- Internet: It has already changed the world. In the next 10-20 years practically EVERYTHING will be done using Internet to a some degree (if it already isn't ?). People won't know how to live without it. Internet is created & run by IT geeks.- Bitcoin: It its highly probable that it will rewrite the whole financial system from the scratch, and with it - whole economy. And economy rules everything: from people, through companies to whole countries. Bitcoin is also run by IT geeks.Some facts:- Huge amount of financial wealth is already owned by IT enthusiasts because of new IT companies such as Google and Facebook.- Because the IT enthusiasts rule the internet, they influence practically everybody's opinion- The IT enthusiasts (including early adopters) will [probably] accumulate almost inconceivable amount of wealth because of Bitcoin. And people with the most wealth will rule- The old people don't understand the new world and won't invest so much in new technologies (just look at Bloomberg/Fox Buisness interviews), so they will be gradually replaced by nerds on all positions of powerAlso everybody should be actually quite happy with nerds as their new ruling elite. Reasons:- Nerds IT geeks are smart. - Nerds IT geeks are more logical than other people, so are less prone to manipulation- Nerds IT geeks don't lust money as much as most other people (they care about gadgets and IT stuff instead).- Nerds IT geeks don't lust power as much as most other people (they care about doing cool things with IT stuff instead). Which implies greater resistance to corruption.- Nerds IT geeks actually know how to build, run & test complex systems, so if they were to rule globally, that would improve the world a lot (just look what the Internet has done already, and much much more can be achieved)So if you are not an IT geek, you should welcome your new geeky overlords.If you are an IT geek, you should prepare for the inevitable and try to be a good ruler for your future underlings.I know all of this may sound funny, but I am actually quite serious. But Bitcoin economy has much higher percentage of nerdism than normal economy. And many early adopters were nerds. And they will be almost unimaginably wealthy (think WHOLE-COUNTRY-BUYING-WEALTHY) once Bitcoin is globally used to buy groceries. Everybody should be glad the nerds will be the new elite.- We are smart.- We don't care as much for money as most other people (we care about gadgets and IT stuff instead).- We don't care as much for power as most other people (we care about doing cool things with IT stuff instead).- We actually know how to build complex systems, so if we were to rule, that would improve the world a lot (just look what the Internet has done already)NERDZ RLZ. This is extremely paranoid even by my standards and I am quite paranoid.
They are just trying to get Bitcoin accepted by the masses and recognized by official media. Of course they have to be centralized if they ever want to succeed in doing that. I don't mind that the Foundation exists - as you said: BITCOIN CANNOT BE CONTROLLED anyway, so why worry ?Completely decentralized things don't work in the real world - that is why foundation exists: to create a bridge between the two worlds. That all depends......On how much china really hates US dollar. Because BTC is going to undermine dollar sooner or later - it is practically inevitable.China could get rid of the "dollar problem" by either supporting Bitcoin, or simply doing nothing to stop its expansion (very good excuse) . The rest will do itself. Excellent vid, thanks Mike. Yeah, yhou can use Armory for that too.It would probably also work on my fork though. You can try sending it with my fork (look at my signature) to pay a lower fee, but you risk that the transaction will take weeks to confirm or it will not confirm at all (depends on if the miners will like it or not).I haven't checked how such scenario works yet, unfortunately - so as I said: it's risky. Thank you very much, this is highly appreciated & anticipated by many people. I don't know who this Bitcoin ATM guy is, but he was simply AMAZING. He responded to all accusations (almost) perfectly.GOOD JOB ! Of course they are. In politics & media, somebody is almost always paid to say something. Why suicide when it is going to be back to 260USD/BTC in maximum 6 months ?Idiots. Well, natural selection i guess.IDIOTS: STOP SHORTING BITCOIN, IT IS AN UNPREDICTABLE CURRENCY. SELL SELL SELL !!(Or perhaps maybe just calm down and don't let "big media" propagandists/speculators make you lose so that they can buy more)----But i mean - seriously. What the hell is wrong with some people ? Correction was obvious and totally expected. Is there somebody here who didn't expect it ?The currency is young, unstable and unpredictable. As all new things are. Oh, that is quite obvious, isn't it ? It had to happen sooner or later and most people on this forum were expecting it almost since the dawn of Bitcoin. Not bad. I actually like that vid.The old sceptic smart guy is asking very important questions even though he is obviously taking side of FED and governments/central banks. Better fix the date or kiba is gonna eradicate you. I'm just tellin' ya man. There is one reason why it won't work. Because we are already expecting it. Scenario has already been written, and this information will not be forgotten, because the Internet does not forget.And when we are expecting it, we will be prepared.Also I don't think the current rally is an attack by the banks. If that would occur, we would see a prices in range of 10.000-100.000 USD per bitcoin, at least. I mean, they can print money - nothing can stop them from raising BTC/USD price to $1M USD / 1 BTC. It seems there is a lot more people having problems with BTC/LTC transfers on BTC-E...Check out this topic in newbie section:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=170592.0It is probably not safe to do any trading with BTC-E now, until they sort this out. Yes you can.It is impossible/infeasible to counterfeit Bitcoin using today's technology. OK, thank you. Fixed.I will close the topic now. @BTC-E:You better start explaining what is the reason you take 48 hours to deliver Litecoins:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=170302.0Last time I checked you weren't a fractional reserve... I tried to buy some Litecoins on BTC-E.com yesterday.I tried a test transaction first, it was sent immediately. Then, I tried the bigger transaction... several hours have passed and I am still waiting.The support replied to me:WTF is this even supposed to mean ?!Proof:http://explorer.litecoin.net/address/LfkyWuBj9dvaHJ7LNGaoPc4PhzSRmFVZ8Shttp://imgur.com/CS3CsGRAlso they say that Litecoin withdrawals are supposedly instant. Proof:So is BTC-E doing fractional reserve or what ? Are they a scam ?They seem to be big and established market - this is the reason i tried trading with them. I support this.Let's try the simple solution and if it doesn't work, we can try something else.Bitcoin is all about free market, right ? So let's allow the market to decide for us. Configuration setting can be made for both client and miner applications, so users will be able to choose.
This is a revolution. Mankind may be even reaching a human development singularity, who knows.I am happy I got to live through this, experience this and take a part in this. Perhaps i will have a lot of stories to tell to the next generations. Your math is roughly correct, however you don't count the socio-psychological aspect of what would happen and how would people react if somebody started buying massive amounts of graphic cards. 1. Such event may not go unnoticed when you are a big entity (such as government). This could produce news like headlines "Government is going into Bitcoin mining", which would drastically increase not only Bitcoin value, but also create an influx of new users & miners into the network, which would result in increasing the difficulty massively.2. Also, some governments (such as China's) may not like other governments (such as US), so if for example US governments starts fighting Bitcoin to save dollar, China's government may start their own Bitcoin mining program. China really doesn't like US dollar as a global currency, they just pretend they are happy with it.3. After Bitcoin reaches certain critical point as a lot of people will be using it, government will not be able to shut it down without causing certain amount of civil disorder / protests etc. It may be a problem for them. It may be even completely impossible if Bitcoin becomes as popular as paypal.However, my analysis could be wrong for some unexpected reasons. Badly formatted date !Kiba is going to come in storming any minute now... Now expecting 1000$/BTC. This year. I don't have a problem. It's more like other developers also find him as weird...Look what Gavin thinks about the guy: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=62037.0 And they already know that it was DDoS attack responsible even that the currency is so unpredictable ?I would rather say that it is pretty normal value correction, especially for Bitcoin. Weird.You know, i have only 512K upload and none of the problems you described. Bitcoin uses little upstream bandwidth, however it is behind a firewall.I can even play Team Fortress 2 having 50ms ping to the closest server with Bitcoin-Qt & 20 other programs running in background. Yeah, sure. Analysts... @BitHitsYou can use either raw transactions or my fork to send transactions with lower fees than normal.However beware, if you miscalculate and send a transaction without fee that should be sent with fee, it may never confirm.This usually applies to dust or very fresh coins (recently received). Kiba, can't you simply get Title Moderating privileges ?That would save everybody a lot of time and stress... Actually, when it comes to mobile payment technologies, Africa is one of the most advanced (if not most advanced) continent in the world. Seriously, in Africa you can already pay for everything with mobiles paying small fees - like nowhere else in the world. I think that there are great possibilities for Bitcoin not only through mobiles, but also embedded & low power devices, because many africans have access to very little amount of electric power (YET they still have mobile phones - unbelievable, isn't it ?). This isn't exactly what i was suggesting.Expert mode can still have a reasonably nice GUI, like CoinControl. ARRRRRRGHHHHH !!BAD DATE ! It does ?I dont't see an "EXPERT MODE" button with a big, red, scary warning (YOU MIGHT LOSE UR MONIES !!!!!!!!!) anywhere.How do I enable it ? Is water wet ? This idea seems nice, however I am afraid there will be some hidden consequences.Can we have a comment on that from a developer ? Why not have both ? The code is almost ready anyway and may be merged into 0.9. @Mike Look how mozilla solved your "dumb user" problem. Show a big warning, and if the user proceeds, that is his responsibility if he breaks something or loses money.*Learn from the best* This x 100.There should always be an EXPERT mode, perhaps even unlockable using INI FILE SETTING to satisfy Mike Hearn as he is so afraid of complicating things for "dumb end users" (stupid people are usually afraid to touch configuration files).Actually this is the reason i created my fork, because Gavin didn't want to give me control over if i want more risk or not. Why not just make a stupid configuration setting in *.ini file ? This is very little work. Ohhhh yes.You are not forced to use main developer's client. Change the code, make one yourself. Or pay somebody to do it. It is that simple.Actually I have a say in this, because I already did so when I didn't like just ONE decision of the devs.
@gweedo, @Wolf0, @paraipanDo you actually fully understand seriousness of this situation  ? Because I don't think you do.Gavin and other devs either are or will be under enormous pressure when they manage a code that manages **1 billion of USD worth**. And it will only get worse as the market grows.I surely know that i wouldn't merge just any code into the main branch if i was in his situation. Do you think anybody wants to be responsible for people losing hundered millions $$$ ? Nope, one does not. Do you know that banks and large corporations, even today, use code that has been written 10, 20, 30 and MORE years ago ? Do you know why ? Because it has been thoroughly tested, it is 100% stable and it just works.So not only is the "slow way" the good way, but the ONLY ACCEPTABLE way. Keep all the new cool and funky stuff out of the mainline client, until there is absolute certanity that it is stable. [Citation needed]Also, he is probably frightened of breaking something. I know i would be in his situation.We're talking hundereds millions of dollars, this is no joke. 1. The blockchain split was only mildly serious bug. AFAIK nobody lost their money.2. The increase of block size was done to ensure scalability of the network ! So it is stability we are getting. 3. The problem existed not because of bug in Bitcoin, but because of bug in BerkeleyDB. Which was used by Satoshi himself, not by Gavin. Coincontrol and such is a fancy new feature which is not critically necessary to proper functioning of the network. But proper block size is. So it got addressed more quickly, like it should. I don't see anything unusual about that. Definately.I personally, like the slower way better. I don't want to lose money because of a serious bug in the code. Do you, paraipan ?I think this whole thread is therefore pointless. There are and there will be forks. There is armory. If the code is good enough, it will be merged into mainline. OR a lot of people will use it instead of the mainline client.You can have either more features faster OR more stability faster. You can't have both at the same time. It is currently impossible to determimne if somebody holds BTC that are "properly secured".Google: Truecrypt hidden volumeWell, unless they come to your home and hack your computer, but then you can hold your coinz in cold storage on an encrypted USB stick. Well,When you add the wikipedia Traffic statistics [90 days]:Number of transactions on the network [1 year]:And Google Trends chart for "bitcoin" word [90 days]Then you can see that we are going for a fast ride to the skies. Yeah, you can do that even today - that's the beauty of it. Just fork the code. Or find somebody that can do it for you.Of course the market would quickly verify your claims and pick a winner.Doesn't matter. The more money are gaining on value, the better. Deflation is good for the economy, contrary to popular beliefs. And Bitcoin will be the perfect proof of that. Get the government to accept Bitcoin by paying them in Bitcoin... Quite a devious plan. But it might just work. Bitcoin's inflation rate is practically a HOLY rule of Bitcoin.If you ever try to change it, hard fork, major havoc and panic on the market are unevitable.So what you are asking for is impossible to do. I for sure, would immediately leave (or rather: switch to the proper fork) after somebody tried to mess with the holy rule.I don't think you understand what "money supply" actually means. Or perhaps you don't understand what money is and what it stands for at all. The inflation rate will not be changed. Period.Deal with it.  If you don't want me to be an asshole, first stop being an asshole yourself.It has been alread explained multiple times that your arguments addressing scalability of Bitcoin (and also some other) are completely and utterly wrong, yet you keep pushing your opinion trying to convince everybody that you are right even than you are not.Stop spreading your bullshit around like a hippo with diarrhea, and i will stop being an asshole. OK ? I think he has a hidden agenda (which is not pro-bitcoin).Or maybe he is just some stupid kid. Then lets make it scale to that level. We can, for example, make a **cluster client**, which will scale to multiple machines and supercomputers, just like Linux kernel scales. It will be run on supercomputers, graphics cards, and mini-clusters like beowulf.Possibilities are endless. So please stop talking jibberish, because you are not making any sense. 2013-03-24 Update:NFTF - version 0.8.0, 0.8.1 released.Fresh tags - nftf-v0.8.0, nftf-v0.8.1 are avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsMASTER branch was also updated to latest Bitcoin version:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf2013-03-24 WARNING !!PLEASE NOTE THAT UNTIL MAX BLOCK SIZE PROBLEM HAS BEEN SOLVED BY DEVELOPERS, SOME FREE (WITHOUT FEE) TRANSACTIONS CREATED BY THIS FORK MAY CONFIRM VERY SLOWLY OR NEVER.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. Is this problem of block size really so complex ? Maybe you are all overcomplicating simple things. Can't it be solved by using one of following ways ?:1. Miners VOTE for the next block size every X blocks, using special transactions, extra data put in previously mined blocks or whatever OR2. Block size is AUTOMATICALLY calculated every Y blocks using some relatively simple algo (like basing on how full previous blocks were) ?Why is this debacle so long and painful ? Maybe we should do one of these and if it doesn't work, try the next in the row ? Another poll that sucks goat balls... Few critically important missing options. Sorry Vladimir, I didn't buy this.This should really be moved to "Speculation". Well, US would have to start World War III or shut down the Internet completely tomorrow (probably by cutting optical fiber cables like they did last time) if that suddenly happened today. I have nothing against conspiracy theories, but I think you went too far with this one.Remember that Bitcoin is still an *HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL* project. So everything about it is experimental, including different parameters (like block size limit).So it is expected that some amount of mess will be generated for testing/balancement/anti-ddos/security purposes in the early stages. I think that the fixed limit will be removed soon, however. Because it is necessary for the network to scale.
Then this whole topic is useless. Why did you even start it ?For me "the accessibility of Bitcoin investments to general public will be ubiquitous" is worth more like 5-10 billion USD than 500 million USD.Unless you are talking about some stupid startup that plans to create a non-fractional reserve bank, investment fund or FOREX-like market. That may be worth 100-500 million when it starts. And how BIG exactly will be this your "thing" ?Can you at least give us a range - like "from 1 billion to 2 billion" ? Ok so then a smaller thing. 1. He is russian, russians are like that.2. Let me guess... If this is a really as BIG thing as Vladimir is describing it, then I can think of one thing:Russia does not like dollar very much. China also. So do probably other asian countries. They may be conspiring to replace dollar in the role of world's reserve currency with Bitcoin. If that is true, then price will skyrocket to about 100 x of what is it now, and even more. Agreed. If they were really trying to protect their wealth, we would already be at 200USD / 1BTC. But...How much % of pure liquid Bitcoin does it contain ? 65 USD/BTC, with market capitalization (slowly ?) approaching one billion US dollars... Oh my god... Invalid link, badly formatted date.Good link:http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1aoi0s/iam_nassim_taleb_author_of_antifragile_ama/c8zb3d8/Good date: 2013-03-20Could anybody correct these at any time ? Because nobody ever does. I was talking about the fixed 1MB block size.Once we start getting close to it, low priority transactions (low amounts, multiple small outputs etc) without any fee may never confirm. You are so wrong (and ignorant) that even explaining you why you are wrong is a waste of time of biblical proportions.Better go back being a slave of your bankster overlords. That's what you do best, apparently. +1 I will make a fork, however be wary that now that we may be reaching block limit soon, so the transactions you make may never confirm.This fork is kind of dangerous until the block size issue is not solved. It is simply extremely difficult to write a program which will do some "Complex Evil Thing(tm)" (like turning your comp into a botnet zombie or stealing your bitcoins) without the code looking suspicious.It is possible, however highly unlikely. Wrong.You haven't considered that every type of "thing" is for different type of audience. Memes, for example are targetted at young people who understand the internet.It's quite obvious that they won't be effective in getting older and/or more serious people into Bitcoin. For them, we have different arguments. YA, RLY.Trying to hide code is trivial to spot because such code immediately fails readibility/understanding tests.Unreadable or not understable code = suspicious code. Ok, but couldn't we get my topic any more derailed ? There, fixed that for you: Let me check it in the books... Yep, already done.This meme spreads like wildfire. Nobody knows this exactly.The fall of EU will be probably very different from the fall of USSR. Shouldn't you simply get a title-moderating privileges in this subforum ?
This. Incorrect, it is trivial to buy a Serial-To-USB cable. It also works under Linux. Checked myself.Just my 2 cents/satoshis. QFT +1 Borrowed from somebody earlier in the topic: When i read it today, i simply couldn't believe it.They just took people's money. Just stole it.  Just like that.THIS IS UN-FUCKIN-BELIEVABLE. Is the system really already starting to crash ?  This is a strong point actually.The fee system requires some rebalancement apparently. Then you will make a great slave.But don't count me in.They can take your car and your house, but they will still be unable to take your Bitcoins. You can sell the house and car for Bitcoins, and they cannot take anything from you anymore.So taxing people having Bitcoins is not as easy as it might seem at first. This will probably lead to lowering taxes to an acceptable (for almost everybody) level.I myself think that the TOTAL amount of taxation (including all hidden fees and taxes) should not exceed 10%. 10% is a fair amount of taxation which i could bear. Oh, i failed apparently. Don't mind me, nothing to see here. This is huge.If BTC spreads in some small countries which don't like USA and want to be independent, it may become a secondary currency in some of them. Then you don't really know a lot about large institutions, do you ?I would bet that many banks run software written in 1999 or even before, you know why ? Because when huge risks and costs are involved, you don't change something that works properly unless there is a serious reason. Hell, some large companies still run COBOL code written 30-40 years ago !Changing software versions is a significant risk each time it is done. AFAIK libertarians believe that social rules are n3ecessary, but there should be a minimal government.No, but you cannot be against libertarianism either, you have to accept that there are libertarians (and even anarchists & crypto-anarchists) using the currency and live with it.Otherwise sooner or later you will start to fight what you don't like, which makes you an enemy of Bitcoin - that is what I am talking about.Its exactly the same with cash - because of people who are against cash, governments of the world are actively fighting cash, and forcing every bigger money transaction to be bank-to-bank transaction. From the posts of yours i would rather say that you are an idiot, not the devs. And a troll.This is an open source project for a reason. Use the source, luke.If you don't like the default Bitcoin client, make a better one yourself. Or pay for the features you want.(Or you could just shut up & die). Link to video please ? This is just amazing. Also, what is more interesting - check out the headers of this URL:So this document is almost 20 years old !They had more than enough time... Quite probably. In some time in the future, a new poll will be made.You can't make a new poll everytime somebody changes his opinion. OK it seems that poll system on SMF is broken and after i locked voting, viewing results is no longer avaiable...Unlocked it.EDIT:Fixed. Poll is properly locked, but results can be seen. Actually that sentence is outdated.I am no longer sure if the network can function without the limit.
It seems that nobody is volting anymore, so it makes sense to lock the poll.I hope everybody find the results satisfying, I for sure do. I thought I have seen Gavin somewhere talking about adding fees to already existing transactions... am I mistaken ? Error: This sentence contains no actual argument.I cannot work with that, please elaborate.Nope. I am dead serious.If you are an enemy of libertarian principles, then you HAVE to be an enemy of Bitcoin, whether you realize it or not. It is simple logic:Bitcoin itself is much more hardcore than Libertarianism (closer to anarchy), so if one doesn't agree with libertarian principles, one also cannot agree with anarchy/crypto-anarchy principles, so it is logically impossible for that person to agree with what Bitcoin stands for. Unless the one doesn't undserstand logic. Sweet Jesus...I knew that there is something seriously wrong with this guy. Actually, this is what I2P developers already do. So it is possible for sure. Luke may not realize this yet, but ideologically he is an enemy of Bitcoin.What he believes in stands in direct opposition to the ideals which created Bitcoin.Maybe he will realize this some time in the future and start fighting Bitcoin - you never know.As hazek already pointed out, democracy is a battlefield of a sort. This topic has derailed into politics.Sorry, i am not in the mood to do politics anymore.  Oh yeah, now less of people will be working on solving the ACTUAL problem which is Bitcoin's suspectibility to spam.[irony]Great news indeed it is. Thanks, Luke.[/irony] If you haven't noticed, he is proposing for all of us to put pressure on SDICE not to generate spam.And i say that is a foolish waste of time which could be spent by thinking out new, automatic ways of preventing spam. With such a foolish behavior, he is doing harm to Bitcoin.This is the reason i think he is an enemy of BTC.Actually this so good I am gonna re-paste it into the top post. Wrong. Not MY enemy. *Bitcoin's enemy*. Then i wouldn't be able to straighten out his foolishness. Then I say, let's strive for no less than perfection and make it orders of magnitude better than society. Let's make it as hard as diamond and as flexible as chewing gum.But Luke-Jr says, "hey let's make stupid laws instead which force you into not attacking Bitcoin". And I say this is incredibly foolish.We can work on that and make it a perfect democracy. Actually, a lot of people is working on it if you haven't noticed. I realize i went slighly overboard with this poll, but i guess even if 99% people say "No", it will at least raise awarness of the "social punishment vs mathematical algorithms" problem.And i still will consider Luke-Jr an enemy of Bitcoin. If you want to have a discussion, learn to quote better first. I cannot work with that. Yeah, the turn of this discussion into politics was unfortunate, I did not intend it. I only know him on the forums, since 2010.----Just raising awarness and colleting opinions here. No, you misunderstood me.By using Bitcoin you MUST accept that other bitcoiners do that (never pay taxes, defy government) or at least live with that. This is not my personal problem. This is ours potential problem now.So I just wanted to raise awarness of the problem. This statement is irrelevant.Bitcoin is, by definition, a anarchist/crypto-anarchist currency for the simple reason it cannot be controlled by any central authority.If you want to use Bitcoin, you have to live with it.
...and by proposing to socially pressure SatoshiDICE to stop their practices you are threatening the very Bitcoin existence by trying to make it weaker. Well, me and Luke-Jr had a little argument lately. Link to full discussion:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150493.220So I am curious - what is your opinion after looking at the discussion - is Luke-Jr an enemy of Bitcoin ?Should you double-check his commits in the source ?Short transcript of the most interesting parts: However i advise you to check the whole discussion. Veeeeery interesting.EDIT:Also you may want to check this out before making an opinion:Plus this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=133974.20 Anybody can be a miner, anybody can buy ASIC and vote with his own wallet. This is also a part of the free market which is the foundation of Bitcoin. Let me be clear:After this discussion I don't trust you. I do not like where you would take this currency if you had the chance. I think you are an enemy.If some day, by some "unfortunate accident" you become main developer, i will vote for creating a fork without you.Nobody is forcing non-libertarians to use Bitcoin. If they don't want it, it means its not for them.Bitcoin is winning exactly because it is lbertarian. Exactly because its free of governments rules & social rules. Without it, it would be nothing. OK. I saved this whole discussion on my hard drive so that I can show people what kind of person you are when other discussions arise. I hope you don't have a problem with that.Oh isn't it ? You are clearly lost and you don't know what you are talking about.Even Satoshi himself has expressed his political views in the Bitcoin protocol - check it out:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block----What kind of delusion are you having guys ?95% of people (including me) wouldn't even be here if not for Bitcoin special properties making it immune to governments.If a day comes that social rules can pressure Bitcoin, then I am out the next day (or I will switch to a fork). Why would i let ANYBODY mess with my money ? If you are enemy of Libertarianism, the you are an enemy of Bitcoin as well.Because Bitcoin is all about libertarianism and crypto-anarchy ?I don't get it. How come you are even a Bitcoin developer with such views/outlooks ? Isn't this kind of what Bitcoin was created for ?Isn't this kind of what Bitcoin market currently is ?Isn't this kind of what libertarianism is all about ?Doesn't that statement make you kind of an enemy of the whole Bitcoin concept (and libertarian spandpoint) by the way ?You are still with us, or against us, because now I don't exactly see your position clearly ? Bumping for great justice.@Luke-Jr:Would you kindly answer my last question, Sir ? I still await your answer. Ok, I admit didn't make myself clear enough.What i meant the algorithms of Bitcoin are here to stop people from breaking currency-related social rules like the following:- Double spending- Forgery- Thievery (to a level, when combined with encryption / truecrypt)- Money creation & devaluation by governments and banks - which is also thievery by inflationBitcoin solves these things automatically and internally without using stupid social rules, without the need of central authorities and/or lawyers. To be clear...  what is that am I proposing, exactly ? It isn't reality ? Then we can make it reality. Impossible is nothing.30 years ago if you asked anybody and told them about smartphones or how today's internet works, they would probably burn you at the stake.We, the "other nuts" go boldly in the future and fix the world with our crypto-mathematics. If you don't want to be part of it, them I am sorry for your loss.Last time i checked, there were at least three different possible solutions to this problem presented on the forums, so excuse me if I won't take your word for that.Then perhaps you should stop wasting time whining around like a crybaby and try to find a mathematic solution instead.Because your (and misterbigg's) posts are like "OH NOES, SDICE IS GONNA KILL US ALL SBDY STOP THEM OMG OMG OMG !!!!!1111one" If you think that you can pressure ANYBODY into doing ANYTHING in a world consisting of darknets, peer-to-peer, mathematics, hardcore cryptography, crypto-geeks, ancarchists, libertarians, hardcore goldbugs & deflationists, then it is clearly you who is delusional.You cannot tell anybody here (including SatoshiDICE) to do ANYTHING. Deal with it.Wrong on all counts. There are two realities. The "realworld-reality", and "Internet-reality".I wonder how didn't you notice that before. We are creating a new, better world here. A world where free market without government intervention is created and ensured automatically using mathematic algorithms which are better than stupid social rules, because they cannot be broken easily. People are always the weakest link in chain and that is the reason Bitcoin exists: to route around human imperfections.Completely robotic anti-spam is the only way out of this situation.SatoshiDICE is completely nothing compared to an evil, powerful & determined attacker having hundereds millions of dollars avaiable. So if SatoshiDICE is a problem which cannot be solved using algorithms, that means Bitcoin was a failure from the start. This is wrong way of thinking. Your example is not adjusted to Bitcoin's reality and therefore irrelevant.Bitcoin network does not exist in the real world, where some social rules (like a fine for pissing in the alley) must be created to stop socially-unacceptable behavior. We are past that.The Bitcoin network was designed to cope exactly with people breaking social rules. Paraphrasing your example:In the Bitcoin world the valley is completely robotic & automatic so therefore no stupid laws are required to make it work. To fix the problem algorithms of the valley should be changed to automatically drive away people trying to piss in it ! Again: you cannot and will not tell SatoshiDice (or anybody else for that matter) what to do with their Bitcoins.If they can send spam, then it is a problem of the network. The network should not allow them to do that or it should make it unfeasible/uneconomic. If it doesn't do that, it needs to be fixed.----Please, stop spreading your stupid FUD. Oh, I understand this perfectly. But you are not really on topic.What is this discussion about is:- Misterbigg wants us, community to *socially pressure SatoshiDICE into stopping generating spam*- I (and many others) say that this is *bullshit and a pointless waste of time, because network should be designed to cope with that*. And if it isn't yet, it should be. Why ? Because somebody with really bad intentions will start attacking it using this vulnerability sooner or later.  This is such a terrible bullshit. Can you all please stop creating this bullshit and spreading FUD ?You simply don't get the point: If the HUMAN behavior is a problem which the network cannot solve itself using its own algorithms, then the network is useless and doomed to failure.There can be no such thing as human component-based bug in the protocol, because the protocol is designed to cope exactly with that.Bitcoin is still on very early stages. If BTC at this stage cannot cope with such a minor disturbance as SatoshiDICE currently is, then it cannot cope with reality at all and should be either fixed or redesigned from scratch.The point in short:The whole Bitcoin network exists exactly for the reason of coping with human imperfections (like forgery, double spending, thievery and other cons), so if it cannot do that, that means it is *completely useless*.Did i make myself clear this time ? Perhaps somebody should start selling some kind of PCI-Express slot dedicated ASIC coprocessor for such computations to mitigate that bottleneck ?If Bitcoin becomes really popular, such needs may arise in the future - i can see a market for that then. Exactly my point. We should THANK them for exposing it - i would rather have SDICE exploit this flaw now rather than somebody else with really bad intentions some time in the future.No, it wouldn't be nice. If not SatoshiDICE, then somebody will use this flaw in the protocol.SDICE is putting a pressure on the parties interested (miners, devs) to fix this. So I say don't bother SDICE and let it continue until the protocol bug is resolved.For the thousandth time: There is NO "problem". Just a bug in the software.----Also, OP of this topic is simply spreading FUD. This forum should have a red or orange warning box on the top of each topic (placeable by mods, admins & devs only) to warn people of scams and events such as this.What do you think ? This is not "raising awarness". This is whining like a crybaby, and spreading unnecessary panic & chaos.
Bullshit.Not every user of the network is acting in its best interests. On the contrary: there are and there will be many people who will try to destroy the network or simply use it for their own means / their profits without caring about how this affects other users.We need to be prepared for everything, not whine around because somebody is using a known vulnerability. Vulnerability needs to be fixed and that is end of discussion. Ah so you must have very gullible buyers.As somebody mentioned above me: Doesn't this invalidate the whole point of using TOR in the first place ?Isn't this a perfect example how a government-run honeypot would work ? Exactly. This whole thread is complete bullshit and waste of time. I don't have access to TOR where I currently am, so i have questions:1. Is the source avaiable ? 2. Can anybody view the source, or just buyers ?3. Is this a honeypot  ? Been practicing necromancy much ? Are you a professional Lich, or just an adept ?Seriously guys, this forum should have an option to close very old topics. Perhaps automatically, by vote or by owner. If he can spam Bitcoin network that means its a vulnerability. Vulnerability that needs to be fixed.It is pointless to "put pressure" on anybody. On the contrary, its good that somebody shows us what needs to be improved. SatoshiDICE is not our enemy, just an opportunist using an opportunity.If ever governments decide that they don't like Bitcoin after all, SatoshiDICE will be the least of our problems. A real enemy like that will use any means possible (including spamming the network) to harm BTC.So perhaps let's grab this opportunity to harden the Bitcoin protocol instead of complaining...+1 I did an interesting Google trends query today. Well, actually the results were most interesting:http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=bitcoin%2C%20palladium%2C%20forex%2C%20liberty%20reserve&date=today%203-m&cmpt=qNot bad i would say, not bad at all. Highly unlikely. Such things are almost trivial to spot by an experienced developer or even better: code audit - oriented developer/specialist (when you have the source code). I actually checked their sites (WinPoker.com and ipoker.com) on ALEXA and it doesn't seem to me that they are largest poker network.Also, winpoker has bad WOT (web of trust) ratings.Where is the proof that they are largest ? Seems pretty complicated.Wouldn't it be easier to create a RAR archive containing the wallet with enough repair/recovery data, and give only part of the data to your family ?With proper balancement of amount of recovery data, the same thing could be achieved. We are watching history being made live.Also, the Bitpay guys really know how to do their job. Amazing (Or rather: "Amazon" ). Absolutely yes. There is.Still a lot of people who don't yet know about Bitcoin is using LR, C-Gold, Pecunix, Perfect Money etc for their semi-anonymous trading.Making an exchange will help these people move to Bitcoin, so i would say that there will be market for it at least for the next 5 years, until everybody of them moves.I was stupid not to make an exchange like this myself, but now its too late for that. So i wish you good luck and good profits. Hahahahaha.Splendid statement, milord. Yep. yeah, here be dragons Well, in my defense - Gangnam Style is also an "Internet thing" just like Bitcoin. And just like Bitcoin it came out of nowhere, nobody expected it and it drastically changed the world (world of popculture in Gangnam's case).Gangnam style is kind of a revolutionary thing just like Bitcoin - it shows an important thing: that simply anobody today can become famous, start a revolution using Internet and change the world in a relatively short time (before the internet era such changes would take decades or even generations).Both Gangnam style and Bitcoin show that we live in truly remarkable times when just anything can happen tomorrow, growing at exponential speed.(I am serious, this is not a joke) @cozz:This is soooo awesome.I want to express my gratitude for your hard work on this. Is your donation address valid ? This year, Bitcoin may become mainstream almost as fast as Gangnam Style. I hope he isn't doing it only because he invested heavily in Bitcoin and now he wants to keep the BTC price going up... +n, n->∞QFT.//So much truth about how this fucked up system works in just a single topic.
Let me get your point straight: Who should be hit by lightning specifically ?PS.Unfortunately that would be a fork of reality, which is not easily done unless you are the creator. 0.8.0 is coming slowly, probably this week.However i do not use Windows at all and have no interest in it, so you will have to build it yourself.It builds exactly the same way as mainline version does. Instructions for building mainline version are here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5851.msg86700#msg86700http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/587/how-do-i-build-bitcoin-source-in-windows-7 Aye, quite impressive. http://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition-130302/Bitcoin mentioned multiple times, as most of VPN services accept Bitcoin. Also multiple mentions in comments. Probably because 1. He (or they) is afraid of the global elites (and he/they should be).2. He (or they) wants to have a normal life3. He (or they) wants to do other project independentlyNo.No.No.No.I hope i my thoughts helped. You sir, are an idiot.Life is going to constantly kick your butt with this attitude. The funny thing is that you are yet too stupid to realize why are all these things happening to you.Or perhaps you are just some kid. In that case, i hope that when you grow up, you will start to understand things. People like you are one of the reasons why taxes (and almost everything coming from government) have to be forced. You should reduce your assholeness level. I want to be happy with ruling of my government, is that really so much to ask ? I f I am happy, I want to pay taxes, because government  doing a good job means we need more of that good job. If government is doing a bad job, we need less of it -> so less taxes from me.Perhaps we should redesign the version of democracy we are currently using, because it clearly sucks goat balls. Quite possible i would say.You never know what are these govt morons going to do. This is such a terrible piece of bullshit.We do not exist for governments, it's the other way around. Governments exist for us.We should pay taxes because we want to, not because we are forced to. If we are all forced to pay taxes we don't want to pay, it means that something is seriously wrong with our democracy.And actually, because what I said is the case in most countries in the world (except for Switzerland and maybe few other countries) , there is something wrong with the whole world actually. So the sooner the world changes to the situation where people WILL WANT TO PAY THE TAXES (because they will know that the money will be well spent), the better. Woman are not here to make the money, they are here to spend them. (After we become rich using Bitcoins)This is how this world is built.So the smart males who invested in Bitcoin early will be the ones getting the largest number of females and healthiest (& smartest) offspring. I guess that Bitcoin sort of affects evolution of mankind then. Nope it won't as long as 95% of clients will not relay such blocks.Miners cannot raise the limit on their own without the official client supporting all sizes of blocks.Also, i think that some additional code will be needed in order to auto-reject too large blocks, but I may be wrong.Oh well, i didn't read your post completely - just few lines, so no way of detecting the sarcasm. Sorry. No constant blocksize will ever be good, because 1. Market, economy and people are dynamic things. 2. Changing the limit every time we need to is unfeasible. It is better to solve things once and for all instead of changing it frequently to cope with increased needs.3. 1MB was just a temporary solution for BETA period. Even satoshi mentioned that the limit will have to be changed some time in the future.IMO blocksize should always scale with the network/demand, the same way as difficulty scales.So there should be either some blockchain voting process, an automated algorithm which decides proper block limit or even both. It seems lately its more for tech ignorants and "empty" people who are afraid of progress and automatically dismiss everything that does not fit their point of view.Or perhaps, is it just envy ? They envy us and they cannot reconcile that WE are the early adopters, not them. Unfortunately, no. You are giving total control to the miners.And sooner or later they will conspire to decide the block size between themselves. Correct, however if any number of transactions can and should theoretically make it into the block, won't the miners conspire and create their own limits anyway in order to save their profits ? So won't theoretical "no limit" result in practical "miners decide what the limit is" ? 1. After the last Bitcoin will be minted, there will be no incentive for miners to mine, except for transaction fees. When block can be of any size, then any number of transactions can make it into every block, therefore theoretically no transaction fees need to be paid.2. How do you protect the network from dust spam & DDoS without block size limit ? No it cannot.Without the limit, Bitcoin network can't function.  +1
2012-03-11:It seems that nobody is voting anymore, so it makes sense to lock the poll.I hope everybody find the results satisfying, I for sure do. I made a poll specially for this occasion, please come and vote:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=145636.0 Here is the proper poll, please come and vote:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=145636.0 Because the previous poll sucked hard, i made a new, proper one.Choose wisely, your future may depend on it. Therefore, this poll is totally broken.I will make a new one. My answer is: none of the above.I think that the block size should be dynamic and recalculated every X blocks using some well-balanced algorithm.Of course, results of this poll are not going to force anybody into a certain decision. Nothing surprising here.This is normal with any new currency or any new market. There will be speculation, there will be bubbles. Lots of them. Of course technically this is incorrect, but i think it is good that they do that.Some not-very-smart politicans who want to attack the idea of fully electronic currency may go after 2 targets (amazon and Bitcoin) so their efforts will be less effective. THIS IS MADNESS !Onslaught rally comes in 5...4...3...WE ARE ON FIRE !! ...which will unfortunately take much more space than microSD card if the encryption is to be done properly (the paper cannot be too small or the print will become unreadable with time).Yes, you do care. A microSD card can be encrypted in a way that nobody even KNOWS whether it **CONTAINS ANYTHING**. And it is easy, just truecrypt + 5 - line bash script.Try doing that with paper wallet. Good luck.You cannot disguise paper wallet as well as you can disguise microSD card.MicroSD card can be encrypted in a way that it will be impossible to tell if it contains anything.Armory allows this. Nah. Paper wallets suck hard. - What if somebody steals the paper wallet from you ? It is not encrypted.- How is paper wallet better than microSD card which CAN be encrypted, so you can push it to the cloud, make multiple backups everywhere and you don't care if the backups get lost or stolen ?An encrypted Laptop which is used only as Bitcoin-safe is much better.The laptop may even have a truecrypt invisible partition  so you have plausible deniability in case a thug wants to take your coins from you.You only connect the laptop to internet when you want to send coins. (You can use Armory offline wallet for that too)Also for extra security, instead of synchronizing blockchain through running client normally, you can synchronize on a different computer and transfer the blockchain files through other means (SFTP, RSYNC). HOLY SHIT !WE ARE GOING CRITICAL !! BUY BUY BUY !! No.Next question please.----PS.I think that this situation is quite useful for Bitcoin for 2 reasons.1. It disperses attention of governments & banks so that they now could go after two targets (even if amazon coin is not really a threat, they may spend some time getting to it).2. It may pave the way for all alternative currencies into the current systemI wonder if Amazon will take this "coin thing" further, making it a real currency, not just a gift card system.

Who cares ? I don't know, but i know that Amazon doesn't. So I guess we are the other universe then ? Yep, so much fuss for nothing. It's just some giftcard-like nonsense, not coin of any sort.
Only if they let giving coins to other users.Otherwise, it's going to be just like airline miles or BP (british petrol) points. Useless. Can't sell them, can't trade them, can't use them anywhere except on the services provided by amazon. . This.I am all for "let-the-market-decide" elastic algorithms.If you let people select what is best for their interests, they will make the best choices through multiple tries in order to maximize profit & minimize risk. Nobody wants to lose money, and everybody wants to earn the most. Therefore market will balance out the block size and reach perfect equilibrium automatically. Sure, there are some differences, but it still is good enough for me.Despite that, it may work even better than standard democracy. If you are using it, then you are supporting it. You are trusting it. You are placing your trust and your life in the hands of the software you are using, the same as you do with elected officials. And there are different choices: Litecoin is one of them. NFTF fork is also a choice (however differences between mainline fork and NFTF are practically negligible).Sounds like a vote to me. Depends on the point of view. From my point of view, in the world of open source, the mainline client/fork is the elected official, and users are the voters.Every user or group of users can become/create an elected official by creating a fork of his/their own, and other people can vote for the official by using forked version of software.Additionally, in open source every fork/elected official can have all/none/some of the features of all other forks/ellected officials, so IMHO open source democracy is even better than normal democracy. No wait, this is also a democracy. Anybody can make a fork and convince people to download & use his fork (vote) instead of the other candidate's fork. That talk was pretty interesting.Also, *amazing* job Gavin ! Doesn't matter that there are some of them in the opposition.If they would declare bitcoins kosher, that would mean the orthodox types would accept it as money. The better question would be: Is Bitcoin Kosher ?  Because if it is, there could be big money coming at us... WOW, this is huge.What if others will follow ? All the power of MEGA for Bitcoins ? Just imagine... This "fork" is just a simple patch i made for historical purposes.I want to remember and always have access to sending 0-fee transactions easily. That is all. You are incorrect, my fork does enforce anti-spam rules. This has already been brought up before.It does not relay invalid transaction without enough fees. The code i changed applies only to sending your own coins, not to relaying any coins.Done, sorry for the mess. I agree with the general conception in the article, however i think that this "Forbes guy" is coming on too strong.Sooner or later he will make "somebody important" somewhere angry and governments will start "Bitcoin prohibition" campaign.I still think that Bitcoin will win (sooner or later), but i seriously doubt we need this kind of publicity. Nope, it is not voluntary if the mainline client's algorithm decides so.This is why i created this fork, because i dislike some decisions of the client. If I want to send money without fee and risk losing it (but the risk is very very low), that should be MY decision, not developer's decision.Why didn't the devs simply make an advanced configuration setting for that is beyond me. 2013-01-27 Update:NFTF - version 0.7.2 released.Fresh tag - nftf-v0.7.2 is avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsMASTER branch was also updated to latest Bitcoin version:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf I am trying to predict maximum achievable necessary number of units of currency that the mankind will ever need in case of Bitcoin becomes #1 currency.So in an (unlikely of course) case that Bitcoin becomes #1 currency and is still used for microtransactions, then we will need at least 500,000,000,000,000,000 total units (500 of US-scale quadrillions) of currency, and currently we have only 21,000,000,000,000,000 (EDIT: which is 21 US scale quadrillions) of satoshis.To be on the safe side, we should add at least 2 zeroes extra, which makes 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 = 10 sextillions == 10 thousands quadrillions == 10 millions of trillions (all US-scale)Oh well sorry, apparently i do that sometimes.I did not actually realize that this is being an asshole. I will try to adjust assholeness level downwards. You did it again, you did not read with understanding.Of course i Have 2 extra zeros in mine, because i counted the pennys !I did all the counting on a calculator (I don't trust my mind completely as minds are tricky things) so you can be sure my calculations are correct.  According your source (http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/20121108/) : 10122.6 billions (i assume that it's US short-scale billions) = 10126.8 x 1,000,000,000 = 10 126 800 000 000=====================      10,126,800,000,000 + 00 (pennys)Quadrillion (US short scale) = 1,000,000,000,000,000(Current M2 With pennys) == 1,012,680,000,000,000 total currency unitsEDIT:So you are NOT correct.  It is quadrillions.And also, we were NOT talking about dollars, but ALL MONEY IN EXISTENCE. So first read with understanding and then discuss. Yep. I think that USA attacking Bitcoin would confirm that it is valuable and that it is a threat to dollar hegemony.If the Chineese are smart enough, they should then start massively buying Bitcoin to undermine US dollar monopoly. I suspect chineese don't like dollar very much, but are forced to use it, as is everybody. Oh, we all fell victim to a vicious necromancer.
I have an even better propositionconst COIN_DUST_FEE_MULTIPLIER = 0.5;b) Miners who mine with this code will require a fee >= 0.001COIN_DUST toinclude TX's with outputs <= COIN_DUSTc) Normal clients will require a fee >= 0.0005COIN_DUST * COIN_DUST_FEE_MULTIPLIER to relay TX's withoutputs <= COIN_DUST No.Let me add some more emphasis so I am clear: Yep, fail meter is never wrong. Are you sure this calculations are correct ?Also, does "other currencies" contain gold & silver bullions + diamonds ?Even if these calculations are correct then we have roughly 5,000,000,000,000,000 (5 quadrillions in US scale or 5 trillions in normal scale) units of dollars in circulation. If you add 2 more zeros for penny, then we have =5,000,000,000,000,000,00 units of dollars vs21,000,000,000,000,000 units of bitcoinSo no, as you can see - it isn't enough. At least 2 zeros (or better 3) are missing from this picture. If you are asking for a tutorial for making a fork.... then you probably shouldn't make a fork in the first place.What you described is not really simple forking. It's creating an alternative currency, additionally to forking.Forking is what I did, but i did not create new currency with that. Of course it is very unlikely, but that is not the point.The UNIX engineers of 1970's also thought that it is really unlikely that anybody in 2013 will use their code & standards such as 32bit UNIX TIMESTAMPS limited to year 2038 and Ipv4 limited to roughly 4.000.000.000 addresses.This shows that humanity is not really very good at thinking ahead, especially when speed of changes is rising exponentially.So let's design ahead while you can, do not wait for the problem to show up (especially that now it is extremely easy to change something, and with time it will be more and more and more difficult, nearing impossible in few decades). Your arguments are valid. Actually I already realized validness of these arguments before, however I am a hardcore crypto freak and i like if my cryptography is blazingly, incredibly strong. I actually use 4096-bit VPN keys to communicate between some of my servers even though i know very well that 2048 is more than enough.So, now that we have determined that more cryptography is not necessary, what do you think about adding more decimal places ?This is not an unrealistic future problem. If in 30-40 years Bitcoin becomes world's #1 currency, then 8 decimal places will not be enough. Why not simply add them now while it is extremely easy instead waiting for problems in the future ?When Bitcoin becomes widespread, it will be much more difficult to change anything than it was to change from Ipv4 to Ipv6 protocol (because of all the mining hardware).However, that argument is invalid.Bitcoin "may never scale" they said. But it also MAY scale - what's then ?This is a foolish "let's wait for the problem appear, before dealing with it" kind of thinking.Really ? That's a simple problem.We can calculate the minimum unit from following algorithm:Code:# [Total value] = all Dollars in circulation + Euros in circulation + Yens in circulation + CNY in circulation + all the other currencies# Convert [Total value] to amount of smallest units/fractions of the earth's cheapest currency (*excluding* internet currencies and currencies of countries with hyperinflation)# Add one or 2 zeros.There you have it. The humanity will probably never require more units of Bitcoin than that, even if Bitcoin becomes #1 World currency and everybody on the world starts using Bitcoin instead of other currencies.Currently, total amount of the smallest units of Bitcoin is 2,100,000,000,000,000 which is just over 2 thousands of trillions (USA scale). Is it enough according to the equation above ? I highly doubt so. Hardware & human lazyness combined with reluctance to change scales even worse.As i pointed out, it will be at least 1000 times as difficult (& costly) to add decimal places or increase cryptographic keys lengths in the future once Bitcoin becomes widespread. So why not do it now instead of waiting for it to become another "case" like Ipv4->Ipv6 transition. Yeah, i know that if right now everybody on earth would generate 10 random addresses a second for 10 years, then the probability of hitting the same address by 2 people would be like 1 to 66,205,589,862,420,404,716,771,980,897 but still... using longer addresses would be even safer !!  + 1000Yeah, I really hate the "Let's wait until it becomes a problem" attitude.Exactly what I am saying.--------Let me sum up the benefits:- Longer private/public keys = more possible addresses, better protection against money loss due to the identical address generated by 2 people- Longer private/public keys = better security when a flaw in one of the fundamental algorithms is discovered- More decimal places = after bitcoin becomes widespread, it will be suitable for transferring/storing smaller amounts of money- It is 1000 X easier to fix the issues right now instead of later This discussion is also about adding more decimal places *before it becomes a problem* rather after it becomes a problem some 30-40 years in the future. I forgot to add, than we can add just the networking & protocol support for 2^512 & 4-6 more decimal places and wait 2 or 4 years with the actual implementation, so everybody will have enough time to prepare. Yep, exactly."Let's fix it when it becomes a problem" is IMHO a very shortsighted & foolish way of thinking.Especially when fixing it now is extremely simple and fixing it 10 years into the future will be orders of magnitude more difficult because of the reasons i wrote earlier.Of course, 2^2048 is obviously too much, but why not 2^384 or 2^512 ? I don't see anything wrong with that. This is one of possible scenarios.However nobody can exactly predict the future and it won't hurt to prepare for another probable scenarios instead of just doing nothing ?However, the UNIX sysadmins of 1970s also never thought that their code will be used to this day and by so many people and - This is the reason we need to do Ipv4 to Ipv6 transition today.- For the same reason, the UNIX TIMESTAMP does not support dates beyond 2038 (was it 2038 ? or 2035 ? I don't remember exactly), which already causes problems in software today.- The same issue with Y2K problem. The conclusion ? Everybody always thinks that their system will be replaced by something new & better in the future, but it often does not happen, hence the problems we have today. I support this. Additionally I propose we add more decimal places (4 zeros or more) simultaneously. Logical reasons:1. In the future, there may be multiple "mainstream clients", so coordinating between different development teams may be more difficult by few orders of magnitude1a. If that happens, there will also be multiple code bases and changing all of them to comply with new standards will be very difficult1b. Because of that, there will be also much much much more testing required, and many many more possible bugs will be produced because of the transition2. In the future, Bitcoin may be heavily used by many powerful financial institutions and each of them will have its own agenda. They may or may not like the enlargement of decimal places & private/public keys for reasons not yet known currently.2a. Large institutions (including financial, governments) have large inertia. It will be difficult for them to make transition to any new standards.3. In the future, Bitcoin will probably be implemented in many embedded devices (such as ATMs, smart wallets, smart credit cards, "smart bitcoin safes") etc. So it will be even more difficult to implement it4. In the future, it will require much more convincing people to switch to the "new, better Bitcoin with longer keys".5. Just look what happened with Ipv4 -> Ipv6 transition. The same will happen with Bitcoin. It will be extremely difficult to make any changes once it is widespread. It is a good idea, however it will not be enough.There should also PHP-side cache based on Memcached to offload MySQL/MariaDB servers.I don't even use Varnish and still I can serve hundereds of requests per second on single server. You can get performance increase of thousand percent and more. Been there, done that.Check this out:Code:$ mysqladmin statusUptime: 3154789  Threads: 16  Questions: 3738552556  Slow queries: 112796  Opens: 27041477  Flush tables: 1  Open tables: 1482  Queries per second avg: 1185.040This is a single Quad Core server, it contains MariaDB, NGINX, Apache and PHP - all on a single server. It serves total of ~1.400.000 views/day (when you count google/yahoo bots).And i still think i can squeeze out much more speed using NoSQL.Also, my MariaDB tables contain ~15GiB of data, with total of 65 million records. MariaDB contains XtraDB (it replaces InnoDB "drop in", plus it is binary compatibile, or at least MariaDB devs claim so) Also, moving from MySQL to MariaDB could be helpful. "Normal" MySQL is not really developed anymore, as Oracle does not give a duck about it - they only want your money by selling you closed source extensions.I have already moved my 2 servers with 50+ million views/month to MariaDB and I am serving ~35 million views with single quad-core server (but of course heavy caching is involved). Seriously ?Why not simply use NGINX with PHP-FPM instead (If not already using it) ?NGINX is already used by many large sites and is blazing fast - I don't think there will be much debate over it.PHP-FPM is slightly faster than SPAWN-FCGI or custom script dispatcher, but consumes much less memory (as all php processes share memory). And thus Bitcoin became the currency of the internet.
I may be wrong, but i think that the best solution would be to implement @kjj's idea with difficulty automatically increasing exponentially if block chain fork is longer than Y blocks.This is still pure Proof Of Work, not really cementing. It would simply require much more than 51% to fork blockchain after Y number of blocks. Perhaps both This is not how things work. Let me tell you how you should do it, it you ever want something done (as with my fork I have already learned the hard way how things work in the world). Nobody will do anything for you (for free). If you ever want to get stuff done, you must work hard, do it and code it yourself, test it thoroughly and only then - when you are 100% sure that it works correctly, you can try to convince people to merge it to the client. Wow, I didn't think about that. Thanks for clearing this up, @Meni.This is a very good discussion we are having, i wish I did that more often. I more-or-less agree with with the rest of your post, this is the part i have doubts about:How is this different when using cementing ?I mean clients already take longest chain when offered multiple chains or different length.No change here.(Unless you were talking about the majority rule, not cementing itself) Exactly. This already happens, but only once every few months. So why not make it more often if there are no known drawbacks ?Simple solutions are not always bad. Yes, but in no way will this be easy to do.It would require simultaneously VERY significant resources in multiple countries around the world AND >51% Hashing power, AND few million $ to buy Bitcoins to perform an attack.Which makes it infeasible for almost every possible adversary on the planet.Attack like this would be almost impossible to do, even for government of a very rich country (we all know what country I am talking about).So the only time a block reorg longer than 10 blocks will ever happen is because an advanced double spending attack.Logically, implementing cementing after Y blocks (where Y = relatively big number, like 15, 20 or 50) should be an absolutely viable solution to our problems.Unless there are other drawbacks, not mentioned in this discussion.I surely could use @Gavin's opinion here. How exactly ?Also, if we implement cementing after Y confirmations as a quick fix and set Y to something relatively high (like 20), shouldn't everybody be safe this way ?I mean, were there ever blocks reorgs longer than 10 blocks ? Do they even occur naturally?  Because (being only reasonably paranoid) there are and/or there will be organizations which would love nothing more than to kill "our small project".Now we are going slow, but wait till bitcoin capitalization reaches 1.000.000.000$ or 10.000.000.000$ - that is when we will see what Bitcoin really can do. And shit will hit the fan. Hopefully it will be too late for them to try anything. I think you are correct and the main logical reason is that cementing protects 100% of the clients (entire network) at the cost of very small fraction of clients gone bad.So the question we must ask ourselves is: what is more important - (1) protecting the entire network against powerful adversaries, or (2) protecting single (<1%) stranded clients gone wild because of either an attack, or local network malfunction ?For me, the answer will be always (1). What if overriding cementing would require some kind of majority vote ?So every time a client receives a new/alternate chain, which overrides something already cemented, it also checks if majority of the network agrees with this ? This could be done by connecting to let's say... 128 randomly selected peers but limited to single node per 65536 IP block (X.X.*.*).Do I make any sense, or is this a stupid idea ? I am not exactly taking economic viability into equation. I am saying that some entity may execute such attack even if it is totally not economically viable. Then i will expand my thought experiment. Let's say that Bitcoin network has grown, and people use it to trade 100.000.000$ worth of goods & currencies weekly.1. A powerful adversary spends 50.000.000$ to buy 1.000.000 Bitcoins from MTGOX2. He builds his alternate double - spending chain for a week, while in the meantime, people buy 100.000.000$ worth of goods & currencies using Bitcoin3. After a week, adversary introduces his chain fork which double-spends his 1.000.000BTC to his address4. At least 100.000.000$ worth of currencies & goods that were bought through the week are lost5. This causes major havoc in the Bitcoin world, people's trust in the currency is seriously undermined.6. ?? ??7. PROFIT !So how do we avoid this ?If even I have produced this scenario, it is reasonable to think that powerful adversaries may already be working on it.Also, another logical conclusion of mine is that all alt-currencies like Litecoin are useless, because attack like above can be arranged with ease using little hashing power.Yes, but will the client rebroadcast it ? Was such scenario already tested ?Ok, so my logical conclusion is that pruning cannot be implemented, until we solve this problem once and for all.But when they do, there will be no way to fix the mess. So i was thinking heavily and it produced questions which will help me (and hopefully some other people) to better understand how the Bitcoin protocol works. If on any level i have made a mistake somebody correct me please.Suppose that somebody (like Botnet, Russian Mafia, Government or FED) has amassed **significant** resources both in money and hashpower (HP > 51%), and following happens.1. That somebody (let's call im adversary) pays a very large sum of BTC (let's say 1.000.000 BTC) to an exchange2. Adversary waits for X blocks* (let's say 100 blocks), while secretly building his own alternate (double spending) chain on the side. 2a. Meanwhile, the exchange & people keep moving the Bitcoins , so the original sum of bitcoins gets divided like this:3. After block 101 passes, adversary introduces his alternate, longer chain which double spends the original 1.000.000 transaction to an address different than the original address, and erases the original chain which divided the sum to multiple addresses from existence.4. ?? ??5. PROFIT ?* - That is possible because he has >51% of HP, so he can always produce chain faster than the rest of the network. Also @see Meni Rosenfeld thread and whitepaper for details.I have following questions: a) What happens to all the transactions from the original chain that happened after the 1.000.000 BTC transaction ? Are they all erased from existence ?b) What happens if the alternate chain completely drops many other (unrelated) transactions that were previously accepted into blocks and received from 1 to 100 confirmations ? Are these transactions completely lost (I) ? Or perhaps only confirmations are lost, and the transactions are unconfirmed (II) ?b1) If only the transactions' confimations are erased (II), will the network re-relay all the 0-confirmation transactions that were done before ? Will the network keep information about unconfirmed transactions which do not exist anymore ?c) Will the original chain be erased from every client's database instantly the moment when a longer valid chain is supplied, or is there some other mechanism at work here ? OMG, OPEC LOL ? I hope OP is seriously not serious. This better be trolling. So far i keep reading lots of vague information & buzzwords on the net about Ripple, and I still cannot figure what it exactly is and what it will actually do.Would somebody care to explain it to me in few simple words ? HahahaSeriously, you made my day. [citation needed]From what i know, the sun will get bloated and turned into a red giant right before the end of its existence (so still few billions years to go). Yep, like 5 billion years worth of fuel.So "at some point" is pretty far-fetched. I seriously doubt even our civilization and our bodies will exist in its current or similiar form. You are correct, however what other solutions (besides some kind of cementing) can you produce that can mitigate the risk of 51% attack ?Also, i have sent you a PM.
TL;DR (or rather: TL;DW). I watched first 30 seconds and I see no connection.I don't have time to watch the entire video just to get your point. So get to it. I didn't get this. Can you explain in more detail ? If I understood the paper correctly, using the method described by @Meni Rosenfeld, it is possible to double spend as many transactions as one wants simultaneously, thus completely paralyzing the entire network (Somebody correct me if I am wrong).They make sense, if you are a government or a banker with millions of USD in accounts.Few millions is really nothing for destroying your greatest competitor. You are actually right, however my point is not completely bullshit.It will be much easier to gain 51% in Litecoin than in Bitcoin, because there is (and probably will be) much less hashing power, as there are no GPUs in the game.OK, i didn't know that. My point is invalid.I don't think you understand.Because Bitcoin's adoption is wider, if Litecoin had the same algo, all the equipment used to mine Bitcoin could be used to mine Litecoins AND Bitcoins at the same time (with some modifications of course).https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_miningSo i find it a critical flaw that this isn't possible. It that was possible, Litecoin could quickly gain hashing power close to Bitcoin, which would make it stronger. Without it, it may take long, long, long years. This is not a bullshit reason. I was thinking about buying some litecoins myself, but i resigned because of this.Litecoin can be easily killed by creating a simple FPGA or ASIC which will make 51% or even 95% attacks very easy, because there are no GPUs in the game.Don't you see how big of a flaw is this ?EDIT:Also, because of litecoin's blocks are produced 4 times as often, Litecoin will require few times as much bandwidth and disk space comparing to bitcoin. EDIT2:Merged mining is also impossible with Litecoin, as its algo is completely different. Because litecoin's algorithms are built so that mining with GPUs is infeasible, so it would be very easy for a large & powerful entity (US govt, FED or whatever) to build their ASICs quickly and completely destroy Litecoin.Litecoin is basically ASIC-only thing, there is nothing else that will mine them efficiently. I did a little thinking and came with this quick&dirty trick, but it will probably be a stupid idea, so please dont bite me:Wouldn't it be possible to completely disable resending/re-broadcasting valid transactions having X or more confirmations ? I mean if a client knows that sufficient amount of other clients from enough different IP ranges has the transaction confirmed, then it will reject the same transaction broadcasted with different parameters. Interesting... the conclusions presented in the paper seem valid.I wonder if the devs are already working on this, because it seems serious. This has nothing to do with the topic.This is simple logic. IF there is an extremely advanced being who has the power to affect time-space continuum in every imaginable and possible (or impossible) way, then there would be no way of detecting it, unless it wanted to be detected by design. Complete control, complete power.Whether it wants or not to be detected is a topic for another discussion. This is only true if you are an omnipotent master of the universe. It is because only someone who has mastered all the knowledge there is, can make statements like this with such absolute certanity. So you are a god, in a way. I don't think it is always this way. It simply that people who want money, power and women, twist everything around them (including religion) to suit their needs.  Well, New zeland is also not subjected to US regulations, still US shut down perfectly legal service operating there.But I wish you guys best luck anyway. +1+1You would like both options very much, yes. Oh come on. This forum is almost 95% full of paranoid people (No offense - I do realize that I myself am quite paranoid). The devs cannot even lift a finger without somebody on the forum saying "one of the devs lifted a finger" ! OMG they betrayed us !!!!!!!11111oneoneone.So if you want to find vigilant people, this is probably the best forum for that in the universe. You are correct, however...I am also simultaneously correct.That is because in fascist countries, or countries that are heading towards fascism such as USA, big corporations and governments are working very closely together. ...yet there are people even now, massively selling drugs (and were selling arms, but armory is closed ATM) for Bitcoin over the internet. Silkroad is the proof that what you are saying is false.We already have the technologies to protect us from governments. Bitcoin is one of such technologies. We only need to reach for it and use it.Also, you should watch Jay Rockefeller saying that "Internet should never have existed":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct9xzXUQLuYThey are NOT in complete control anymore, otherwise he wouldn't be so desparate to say it. And this shows they ARE afraid of us and of the Internet. We CAN win this. Oh, it is a very simple answer. There are multiple reasons, all of them perfectly understandable:1. My fork (you should call it patch actually) is too simple to be considered for pull-request and to be included in official client2. I'm not a C/C++ programmer, the code i would produce would be shitty. 3. I don't have time to learn C/C++ properly to make a PROPER fork, so i stick with this patch of mine.4. None of the official devs, or even alternative client devs care about the feature I want. Actually, even many "normal" people don't care, so that isn't a surprise.People will always have the freedom to choose if they want to use the official client, or one of the other clients. And there are already multiple clients plus several more clients on-the-way. So you will ALWAYS have choice.And, If you don't like the set of choises you have, you can write/fork your own. If you know how to do it.No surprise there, I know exactly where the world is going - it is going into totalitarian state mode. The difference between me and you is that i think that Bitcoin, together with Internet, Linux, TOR, Freenet, I2P, OpenVPN and many other OS technologies can stop that from happening. Incorrect again.This is similiar situation to the topic of Bitcoin Foundation establishment. And guess what - somebody made a poll asking "do you support bitcoin foundation", and about 30-40% (if memory serves me right) responded that they do not trust the foundation (do some searching, the poll is still on the forum).This is not a centralized project and nobody tells us what to think. Where did you guess that from ? Surely not from my post.FIY, i used gopher and telnet intensively in high school. SSH barely even existed yet (as did internet banking or firewalls) and everybody used unencrypted protocols for freaking e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g. We also played Text-MMO's (called "MUDs") before even the "MMO" name was invented. So yeah, I know how the internet looked before the WWW era.
You don't understand what you are talking about.The internet and WWW are indeed very very very very very different, the same way as roots of the tree are very very very differnet from leaves of the tree.Technically speaking HTTP is only one of the top-level protocols of the Internet, and it is not even responsible for the most of the traffic !Since you don't understand, let me show you. This is how The Internet is built:Hint: Everything below the Application layer comes from ARPANET. HTTP/WWW is completely in the Application layer.When you post a topic on this forums, it goes through multiple layers of technology which all evolved from ARPANET before it can reach the server.EDIT:I found an even better schematic:Also, here is the wikipedia article:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite#Layers_in_the_Internet_protocol_suite None. CERN website is true but still your statement is false and misleading since Internet was created by US Government & Military, not by CERN.Also, it seems you have no idea how the internet actually works and this may be the reason of your invalid line of reasoning. OMG, what the hell you are talking about ?I'm starting to think you're delirious or trolling.Actually, i have perfect proof that what you said above is total crap. This topic. This very topic is the perfect example that proves that it is extremely difficult it is to manufacture consensus in the Open Source world !Look at the "Alternative currencies" board https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=37.0. Forks of the official client spring up even if there is a relative consensus. Ask yourself what would happen if there was no consensus at all ? New forks would be created every hour. There are already multiple alternative clients. Even i created a fork, because i didn't like ONE decision that the devs made. Do you seriously think that it is possible to easily manipulate "consensus" in this situation ? User always has a choice of his client. So why the hell would he choose client that is disadvantageous for him ?I see it this way: either your logic is nonexistant or you are trolling.I will try. This is a complete Bullshit. This is so bullshit that the stench can reach me over thousands of miles of optical fibres & UTP cables.Bittorrent, Netflix, FTP, SFTP, SSH, P2P, Bitcoin, TOR, Freenet, Gnunet, Email and many many many many many many many other protocols have nothing to do with WWW. And they do use IP protocols, which is a child of ARPANET.And i would wager if they don't contain at least 51% (if not 70%) of the total network traffic. This is not completely false, but missing the topic.The IP network protocols that HTTP/WWW traffic operates on were created by US Government as ARPANET project.So you are incorrect. The Internet WAS started by the military.Of course then they had no idea what the project they started would become after many years. If they knew, government would scrap it and it would never see the light. TOR project (AND THE FREAKING INTERNET BTW) was actually started by US Government.So there is nothing peculiar about that.This is how it works:1. Government creates and funds an idea in secrecy (usually for military or intelligence)2. After the project is no longer secret, scientists of all sorts take over & develop the project3. The project is deployed academically4. The project is deployed comerciallyThis is completely normal way of doing things, there are multiple examples - including TOR, The Internet and GPS. You have no idea what you are talking about.And also, you have no idea about how programming (and especially open source programming) works.The proper thing for somebody in your position would be to shut up and never talk again on this topic, but i seriously doubt you are smart enough to do it.This topic is turning into a serious trollfest.  (I don't know if you are talking to me or not, so I will answer just in case)No, development can be done openly even if all devs are known only under their nicknames. IRC, Git, SSH, Email, Web forums - all of these can be accessed using TOR, I2P, Freenet, Gnunet and similiar technologies. @jgarzikI generally agree with you on most points, however there is a logical concept you don't seem to grasp:It may be too late for the long game, since Iranians apparently already know about Bitcoin, and by prolonging discussion in this thread you only increase the probability that even more Iranians will get to know Bitcoin because of viral Streissand Effect which you created with your censorship act.So i would say the thing to do now is prepare for shit hitting the fan once Iranians start taking Bitcoin seriously and US government notices the issue.The question is not if, but when this will happen. So if you are that much afraid of US govt, perhaps you should either move to Europe or disappear from the Internet and return under different, TORified and anonymous identity, just like I2P devs did. Satoshi knew exactly what he was doing - this is why he remains anonymous. This is actually GENIUS. Quite seriously. It turns whole matter around. Not necessarily.Every action you take (like posting, commenting) in the Internet may lead to more people knowing about the issue. The issue spreads faster, and more people learn about it in a shorter amount of time, thus increasing probability that more people (including Iranians) will come across it.Simple logic.EDIT:I believe today it's also called "going viral". And this is what we are doing - strengthening the virus. Let me repeat myself, because it seems that most of people here don't get it:**The longer you discuss on this topic, the more Iranians will eventually start using Bitcoin**(jgarzik should not have censored the guy in the first place, but it's too late for it now)Streissand Effect is a bitch. +1000And to say more, by calling it *THE* Bitcoin Foundation they only made it worse, because it's like saying "Hey, we are the CENTRAL Bitcoin Authority !". Not very smart if you don't want to be first target in case of "some" government decides that Bitcoin is illegal after all. After reading this discussion, my conclusion is that it totally brings down to one thing: FEAR.It is also clear that after this topic and "Iranians start to use Bitcoin" article on Buisnessweek, there is no stopping Iranians from using Bitcoin, and hundereds of pages of posts will only make it worse by spreading the topic further into the Interwebz.So those of you (including some devs) who are afraid of US government should leave the boat now, while the matter has not become "very hot" yet, and return later (or not) under anonymous identities using networks such as TOR, I2P and Freenet. And it is highly probable that this will become hot. Yep, this might be a problem.If the core devs weren't already known, i would suggest them going the I2P-way. Some of I2P anonymous network devs are known only under psudonyms and are hiding behind the network they created. We could have the same kind of devs when it comes to Bitcoin.Perhaps, If for some reason current devs would not want (or could not) to maintain Bitcoin anymore, then some new, anonymous devs could take over, I2P - style. +n, n->∞Big Shots talking in favor of Bitcoin... sorry guys - not gonna happen too often. First thing, i like the idea very much.One small suggestion though:+1Seriously jgarzik, these names are getting more and more confusing.How about calling it glibbitcoin, jgbitcoin or libbitcoin-jg ? +1Also, i could throw few satoshis at julz for encouragement, if only he provided an address in his sig. ...until we invent sub-space communication.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspace_%28Star_Trek%29
Are we supposed to know this guy ? Maybe the font is too small, and there is no actual box, so people don't see it ? Yep, that could also produce a warning.  I was thinking about how to curb the problem of thread necromancy, and came with following idea.1. Show a skull icon like this (but smaller):  on topic list next to threads that are not touched for 3/X months or more.2. When replying to an old thread, show a big font red warning in a box like " Warning: The thread you are posting in is long dead"What do you think ?UPDATE:3. When reading an old thread, show a big font red warning in a box like "Warning: The thread you are reading is long dead"Perhaps bigger version of the icon could be added to warnings as well, so they are more noticeable. Yep, http://tech.slashdot.org/story/12/06/01/1450204/google-highlights-censored-search-terms-in-chinaSeems like Google seriously joined the fight against Internet censorship. Why would they give discount if they have to pay a fee to the BitPay similarly as they would pay to PayPal ?Also, even if they processed the Bitcoins themselves, they would still have to convert BTC to dollars anyway, so there is another small loss in the process of exchange. I find following response appropriate for this occasion:AWWWWWWWESSSSSSOME !! AAAAAAAAAWEEESOMEEEEE ! + 10 ^ n, where n -> ∞ Don't get serious so quickly.We are not complaining, simply suggesting how to improve the product significantly using minimum extra labor. ...and we do it for free. + 1Physical world sucks when it comes to detecting counterfeited items. #MatthewLM:Hey Matthew, does your client allow user to risk re-sending "fresh" coins without a fee, or do I have to fork cbitcoin the same as i forked mainline client ?EDIT:By "fresh" coins i mean just received coins but having 6-7 confirmations. Official client won't allow to re send these, so this is the reason i created my fork. ...but not impossible for a skilled person ? +1This is extremely important because of possible forgeries.I think a youtube video explaining in detail how to determine if the hologram sticker was re-attached using glue or something would be useful. The easy solution was simply to remove the unnecessary boldness from the title."Not-drawing-attention-and-simply-doing-good-job" way was always easier for me, but if you like to do it the harder way, then by all means - proceed as you like. "The route to Bitcoin's future" sounds very bold. It is a bold promise. With title like that people will expect (quite reasonably ?) the best of the best, which automatically generates a pressure on you. Many people can't take such pressure and quit after some time. I hope you are not one of these people and you can live up to your promises.EDIT:I think that one of the reasons Linux kernel succeeded was because nobody expected it to grow so big, so there was no pressure on the devs to "deliver", so they could work undisturbed and do what they like. As the only author, you can license under as many licenses as you want, simultaneously. KDE does/did something like that. They licensed under both GPL and commercial license (for money) in case some buyer didn't like the restrictions of GPL.You can do that, but it will require every other contributor than yourself (if there are/will be any) to completely pass their copyrights to you and give you sole property of their code. Since IANAL and this may be little legally complicated - you would need to do some research on topic how the KDE guys did it exactly.Mozilla also licenses Firefox under GPL,MPL and LGPL.----And BTW, the "nasty bits" of GPLv3 are there for a reason - because big companies usually like to play nasty and generally fuck over everybody (including OSS devs) for profit. I will also donate, just waiting for my client to sync with the net.You know, as it was said above - this project holds tremendous importance when it comes to Bitcoin future, so it probably wouldn't hurt to try kickstarter or something to pay for your time. The swiss people are smart. Both politically-smart and economically-smart.During all the wars, they held gold & other money for everybody out there, including Hitler, so nobody ever dared to attack them.I suspect they are investigating Bitcoin and if they find it "worthy", then Swiss banks may become interested in it. Nobody will attack the Swiss, so if Swiss Bankers became an early adopter of BTC, that would create some kind of "bastion" of Bitcoin and show the world that Bitcoin is the way to go, which is kind of awesome.OMG.... just imagine. The swiss becoming first official Bitcoin - friendly country...I hope that this is the case. If he is the only author & owner of the code, then he can license the code under as many licenses as he can, including GPLv3/v2, BSD, MIT and closed commercial licenses.The problem only comes when/if more people join the project.
2012-11-04 Update:NFTF - versions 0.7.0 & 0.7.1 released.Fresh tags - nftf-v0.7.0, nftf-v0.7.1 are avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tags----BTW, since i got bored, here is a picture of grandma roaming the skies on a dolphin (which is kind of not related to the topic, but who cares): I think the developers are already aiming for something like this.Bitcoind is already kind of separate from the GUI, and interfaces can be made around it using XMLRPC API or command line. And I support this.But the OP meant a much deeper split of the Bitcoin clients into 3-4 or even more elements. This is what i oppose, because it creates unnecessary complexity. Wouldn't that be like one-order-of-magnitude more complicated ?Also, why not use both solutions (collective transaction & coin selection) as they are not exclusive ? You would basically have to write an advanced script or a frontend for bitcoind which would use this feature.Anyway, it's complicated, not everybody has time for this and you don't have certanity that you did it properly. I would probably write my own script if that was easy enough. Even if that is possible, it will be far more convenient (and less time consuming) if it would be integrated in the mainline client.  Well it's not necessary for normal usage and probably won't be used by 99% Bitcoin users, but it is a very important feature still for the uber-geek/cryptoanarchist/other WKWTAD* people.--* WKWTAD people = People Who Know What They Are Doing Any updates on the topic ? Is anybody working on it ? I don't think we need to split the Satoshi client. One should ve very careful when it comes to designing advanced multi-layered, multi-component applications when there is no clear need.Stallman tried something like that called "microkernel architecture" with GNU HURD, and see how it ended up. Linus torvalds went the other way, and designed monolithic kernel with attachable modules instead. And look how it worked out: Linux is the most popular, the most advanced and the most scallable operating system on the planet, and is used now almost everywhere, except on the desktop.In THEORY, microkernel architecture with separate independent layers/modules for every function of the system is very neat conception, but in practice it produces incredible amount of communication, latency and compatibility problems.There is a history lesson to be learned from this: "Keep it simple, stupid!" You don't expect centipede cat.The centipede cat expects you. Awesome.Here is standard-issue gift centipede cat for you: Also, why the hell do you keep changing your avatar randomly ?A psychiatrist would probably suspect that you have some kind of mental disorder as you are so unstable that you cannot decide what avatar will reflect you best. If you are saying that Washington DC is regulated, then you have no fucking idea what the word "regulated" means.Come to the UE. We have laws here that specify the exact curvature a banana must have to be allowed on the market. They also tell us how much milk, cheese and sugar we can produce. That is **regulated**. +5 BTCI join the question and pledge 5 BTC if anybody would want to finish it sooner. There still is one concept you simply can't grasp:What you said above is not how open source projects work. In open source world, once most of people don't like the decision of the "central authority", they make a fork, and majority starts using the fork.Examples are many. Gnome 3 -> Mate, MySQL -> MariaDB/Percona, OpenOffice -> LibreOffice. This really works.And I am not even mentioning completely alternative (not forked) projects... At last, finally somebody made bootstrapping Bitcoin easier.It was a major pain in the ass for people running full BTC client. What kind of "again" ?I hope not "suspicious activity again" or "we get scammed again". ...and lose "undisputable elite" status to the early adopters ? Is any power&money-hungry-bastard ever going to accept this ? That is quite logical, indeed.They will not risk attacking using weapons they are not experienced with, but with the ones they handle well. They will keep using their usual methods, slightly modified for specifics of the Bitcoin economy. Of course we can.When you leave people no choice, they do the only thing they can - fight.A proper incentive is required for everything. For example, when all your wealth, well being and even survival is dependant upon doing a thing, you will do the thing.Because these scammers aren't a danger against Bitcoin in general, but danger only to people who believe in magical 7% a week profits. 
With this argument, you have actually destroyed your previous argument about BTC being broken by banks & governments.We are the early adopters, which gives us incredible power. Once banks take over the "normal" bitcoin, we can still have all the coins we hoarded using which we can rule the market.We will fork, and since we (early adopters) will (i hope) hold most of the coins, or at least significiant part, it won't matter that banks & governments created the mainstream version. Because we can move to the fork, simultaneously causing the mainstream version to die by (for example) manipulating market through selling all coins at very low price simultaneously.More coins = more power. If we have most of the coins, there are endless number of ways we can destroy the mainstream version, while forking and promoting the new, better version. @acoindrSorry, i do not have the will or time to discuss or try to convince you that LTC sucks, you are going to find it out yourself.I wish you good luck, i hope you get very rich by using Litecoins, but i seriously I am not joining that wagon. I do understand what you are proposing.However, Litecoins simply suck and that is why there is no positive feedback.Another problem with changed algorithm is that AFAIK Litecoin cannot be merge-mined together with Bitcoin, which sucks even more. The X11/MIT license of the official client does not give the user ANY KIND of warranty, so you cannot sue anybody.However if the devs fuck up, a lot of people are going to be VERY pissed off, including some mafia and CIA, who will both probably use Bitcoin to pay for smuggled drugs, arms & prostitutes (if they aren't doing that already).Extreme amount of time needs to be taken, because a bad coding decision could destroy wealth of many people and have devastating consequences.Changing software isn't always a serious thing. But modifying a CURRENCY is always serious... there is no room for mistake.I think we should be thankful that the changes are so slow. I do not want them any faster - neither should anybody. It's all our money that are at stake after all. +1kkExactly right.@AtlasStop creating pointless threads & attacking everyone. You are behaving like some crazy Atlas nutjob.PS.I hope that you didn't think that changing the avatar again would change people's perception of your person.----This forum should get a Slashdot-like meta-moderation system, so trolls like Atlas get sorted out. Nope, i don't think so.Why not simply make multi-choice poll with few more options ? The option i would like to choose is not present in the poll, so the poll sucks.There should be at least 3 more options, including "The idea is good, however it has some issues which require improving". Actually i think they are afraid, rather than cooperating with authorities.They do not want to touch anything with undefined legal status Why & how exactly do you think that every user is **forced** to do anything ?PS.Also, why the hell do you keep changing your Avatar ? +1kkI am glad we agree on this.Maybe there simply should be multiple ways of confirming one's identity ?Also, the methods requiring more "work" from foundation (such as meeting new member in public place & exchanging PGP keys) can be more expensive, to cover the lost time.  OK, this is actually a [minor] bug.Well, since this is kind of a [critical] bug, it better be. Soon.Still, it will be much easier for the government & FEDs to get their hands on the servers, since the company already cooperates deeply with the authorities.Actually, i do have a not-so-magical way for confirming one's identity, however it will not work for the Faucet.Simply, if somebody wants to confirm his identity, he needs to meet one of existing, trusted foundation members in public place. And then use PGP/GPG to verify that it is the same person, which has registered on the foundation's website & on Bitcoin forums. This is a 100% sybil attack-proof procedure. Also, it provides high level of protection against government collecting all information about "Bitcoin dissidents" just by hacking/taking over the servers or even torturing/blackmailing people.Yeah, i know this will be problematic, but you can charge additional BTC for it. Severity of this bug is [critical]. Possibility of government action against Bitcoin cannot be ignored.The fear of US is well deserved... after all it US that has FED, it is US that jailed Kim Dotcom without charges, it is US that pushes for Assange's extradition even though he didn't break any laws in his country and it is US that has Guantanamo concentration camp, where they can hold & torture you indefinately without due process or even any charges.Severity: [critical]. Sidetracked ? You are not listening to the critics at all man. You simply don't get it.I think that the foundation is good and important thing, but why not fix some bugs while the thing is small. After the foundation grows big, it will be more difficult to make important changes.Here is the list of bugs to be (potentially) fixed:Not listening to critics is not a good thing. It's like dictatorial stance "we don't give a fuck about what you think, we will do what we want".I also know that Gavin probably has me on his ignore list, because he never answers any of my posts directed at him, which is also not very nice.If Gavin does not want (or does not have time, he is lead dev after all) to answer our criticism, he should at least delegate somebody to "scan" the forums to check what people's opinions are, and then answer them collectively on a blog or something. What makes me wonder is why do the foundation founders think that everything is just "perfect" with their child ?Why can't things outside software world have bugs, just as software ?Aren't the "trolls" just people who see bugs and submit them to a bugzilla (which is what this topic actually is) ?OK, the foundation is a good idea, but it has some bugs which need fixing before pushing clearly unfinished alpha-grade product to everybody around the world...@Core teamYou are supposed to be programmers, so think like one. Well, to be 100% clear, only 3 or 4 of the points are mine, the rest are somebody's elses....but you cannot guarantee that.So this counter-argument is useless. Valid argument noted... Will change to (optional) Updated list of the foundation's bugs:1. The name "The Bitcoin Foundation" wrongly suggest that it is the central authority that controls Bitcoin.2. The hosting company of the BitcoinFoundation.org is (with high probability) a Government-run honeypot.3. There is no safe way for people to have a vote in the Foundation without giving up their identities (which could prove fatal in case of Bitcoin users are declared terrorists, or government tries to confiscate Bitcoins from them). 4. Lack of clear privacy policy. No mention about security of member's personal data (are the servers encrypted or whatever).6. The organization is not for profit which means it can't go bankrupt should it provide a crappy service as long as big businesses are prepared to open their purse they can operate indefinitely. (a scary thought)7. The foundation servers are in US, making it trivial for FED & law enforcement to raid them & gather all TBF member data.(optional) - The CEO of MtGox (with all the problems with anonymity, taint listing, AML shit, KYC shit and arbitrary account freezing in this exchanger) is a founder.(optional) - The lead dev who owns the git access and is a founding member and a member of the board of directors for the next two years is a conflict of interest. For point #2, check out my previous post & response:I will update the list... completely forgot that the servers are in US. @hazekFixed.Updated list of the foundation's bugs:1. The name "The Bitcoin Foundation" wrongly suggest that it is the central authority that controls Bitcoin.2.

Changed to optional.

There is no safe way for people to have a vote in the Foundation without giving up their identities (which could prove fatal in case of Bitcoin users are declared terrorists, or government tries to confiscate Bitcoins from them). 4.

Yes i do.However, for it to work properly, some bugs need to be fixed, just like with software.  So, summing it up, the foundation has following issues:1. The name "The Bitcoin Foundation" wrongly suggest that it is the central authority that controls Bitcoin.2. The hosting company of the BitcoinFoundation.org is (with high probability) a Government-run honeypot.3. There is no safe way for people to have a vote in the Foundation without giving up their identities (which could prove fatal in case of Bitcoin users are declared terrorists, or government tries to confiscate Bitcoins from them). Did i miss something ?@Gavin, @Core TeamAre any of these issues going to be solved ? OMFG o_O !It seems i was one order of magnitude more right, than i thought. Of course they would.Nowadays, everybody who doesn't think like sheep & behave like sheep is a terrorist.Regardless of what is The Bitcoin Foundation normal function, it will act **LIKE** a honeypot, in case they declare that Bitcoin users are terrorists and start arresting.Also, all the servers are in US, so it would be TRIVIAL for any law enforcement to get to the foolish ones who willingly offered their IPs & home addresses. And what exactly is the reason for that ? You think you are so smart, yet you can't read with understanding, can you ?Did i say ANYWHERE that it is a honeypot ? No, what I said is "it works like a honeypot, in case if they wanted to delegalize Bitcoin". Huge difference.Also, this forum does not work as a honeypot. One can use PROXY or TOR to access it. Yeah, it's like giving FED/CIA/FBI/MAFIAA all data necessary to imprison all dissidents on a plate (in case they would declare Bitcoin illegal). I do not like this. This actually works like a honeypot. I wouldn't be surprised if, in case of data leakage (which is quite probable), FBI automatically wiretapped all people on the list...Shouldn't there be an option of confirming one's Identity in-person ? For example by meeting one of "core members" in a public place ?This is totally a serious issue, jokes & trolling aside. This is actually concerning.Why would the foundation need anything else than my PGP signature confirmed with my Forum account ?I am never registering as a member then.What about all the people who contribute to Bitcoin project but would like to stay anonymous ? Stop fooling with me. You know very well what I am talking about.Of course, I meant who did the most of coding AFTER Satoshi left the project.EDIT: Another thing is that, if i remember correctly, Satoshi himself blessed Gavin as the project leader. Somebody correct me if I am wrong. Actually, you should first check the github statistics of who did the most of commits and merges, and only second, speak.Another thing is that, if i remember correctly, Satoshi himself blessed Gavin as the project leader. Somebody correct me if I am wrong. Well, he is the lead developer.What other did you expect ? This is a useless poll.It can be easily manipulated by starting multiple accounts...A proper poll mechanism should be written, which only allows individuals with proper reputation (minimum 2 months on the forum, minimum ~100 posts) to vote.The only other option is to vote by posting posts, and later only the votes or reputable people will be counted. OK, i had enough for today.Good night everybody. I didn't say I know who exactly would have the hat, so don't get so nervous... Anyway, it is inevitable that somebody, someday will try to put a trojan in the code. It is not a matter of "if", but a matter of "when". So let's just stay vigilant, and stop pointlessly complaining about the foundation... Atlas, you are missing the point. **Gavin & folks already do control the official releases**. So there is no difference. Actually i support you this time.Despite everything i said before, I actually think that sooner or later, somebody will try to put a trojan in the code. So let's stay paranoid and review every portion of the code for 1000 times. (Surely people who have invested a lot of $$$ in Bitcoin already do it - thus securing their investment)It's better to be safe than sorry. But this is not the "university world".Haven't you noticed yet how paranoid, libertarian and anarchist Bitcoin society is ?Read this thread, find out. We are extremely paranoid. Trying to manipulate the source now would be a personal suicide for the person who tried it.I suspect that many people who post in this thread actually may have tinfoil hats. Sorry, not gonna work anymore in the era of the internet, especially in the cryptogeek subculture, which sustains bitcoin.You (they) need to think of something much, much better. Raise the bar... You still fail to grasp how Open Source world works.If i don't like the code, I start a fork, I present the evidence that Gavin is cheating, so people start using my fork. It is as simple as that.Actually, I already did that once, because i didn't like official client forcing fees in some situations.In case of such event, everybody in their right minds would use my fork, because everybody would know that Gavin's version has government's trojan. Of course, there would be major chaos at first, but after some period of time, we would be back to "normal". Oh, sorry for that - it's just my opinion. It's getting messy here, so i had to increase the font.
Then You have no idea how internet works.On the internet, anybody can denounce everybody, if they have proof. And it is trivial to get proof on the Internet as the necessary wisdom is everywhere accessible within seconds.Also, programmers don't need lawyers, specialists & other expert witnesses to determine if somebody's proof is valid or not. If somebody marks 10 lines of code, and proves that these lines contains a trojan, it is trivial to asses if he is telling the truth.Also, you fail to see that just one evil move of the Gavin's foundation would condemn it forever, and nobody would trust it (or the people behind it) ever again. Is that worth the risk ? Highly doubtable. He's not going overboard. He is a one hell of a crazy nutjob. Obviously, you have no idea how programming works.Thus, you have no ducking idea what you are talking about.Talking to you is as useful & constructive, as talking to a duck.I'm actually starting to wonder if you are really a nutjob or perhaps you get paid to do this. You are a bloody madman. **Nobody** is centralizing Bitcoin any more through creating a foundation than it was centralized since today. Nothing changed.If we don't like the code, we can start our own foundation, and condemn the old foundation. You simply cannot corrupt and deceit source code, as long as there are enough eyes looking at it.It is close to impossible.The human factor is always the weakest factor. The source code factor - that's another story. Actually, I'm not from USA. But USA government will probably have one of the most important roles in fighting or endorsing bitcoin, so that's where my choice of words came from. What most of the people here are missing is that the foundation got founded, because Bitcoin is going mainstream.It is not possible to go mainstream without any official body that will represent us, comercially & legally. Ever. The real world is not decentralized as Bitcoin network is, so we need some kind of gateway between both worlds.This is the basic and real reason the foundation was created You behave like an illogical fool.Bitcoin foundation has nothing **DIRECTLY** to do with the quality of Bitcoin source code.This move changes nothing in the code. If the code stays working as well as it worked before (or even better), then there is nothing wrong about having a foundation which will speed up the work and create pro-bitcoin lobby in the bloody congress, for example. If anything suspicious happens, I will be the first to abandon the "official" client then.For now, such scenario seems highly improbable. Let me make explain it in other words: Stop grumbling people.This is a great move. If they can keep the foundation working at least as effeciently as Linux foundation, only good can come from it.Linux is also a decentralized project of a sort (as all Open Source projects kinda are), so creating similiar structures should work. At least in theory.If you don't like this foundation, you can start your own. If people will be unsatisfied with Gavin's Bitcoin foundation, they will switch to your one. It is as simple as that. Of course you know you're gonna need a DHD to dial this ? Elaborate ? Oh c'mon !Is this the great and mysterious news ? Why all the secrecy ? I think that topics on this forum should automatically close after a certain period of inactivity time (perhaps 3 months or less) to prevent necromancers from casting their spells and thus creating an unbelievable mess.Who's with me ? Low. Well, the prototypes work as predicted - that is something.However in real world situations, when there are hundereds or thousands of cards in close vicinity with electromagnetic intereference from all sorts of weird devices, things may get more difficult. We already know how it "works" with WiFi - when there are more than 10-15 devices per router, nobody can go online (i don't know about mesh wifi though).  Wow.... their video is simply... mind blowing.However, as much as i want them to succeed, i don't really believe they can. They aim extremely high with all that advanced technology that is supposed to fit into such small card...And I am not even saying anything about the problem of electromagnetic interference... Mintchip is a piece of crap.They haven't even started yet, and they lie already. What a pity. Already answered in great detail. Check this out:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=110868.0 It's lucky that people like you who have no idea what they are talking about don't decide about such matters.
And this is what i call an answer.Maybe it isn't perfect, but at least it is a proper answer.Thank you very much. Of course there is.But for now i have not heard **ANY** real explanation from them. "I would leave if it would be a scam" is simply NOT any kind of explanation. Not good enough.Also, what about the other guy which (was ?) involved in 25M fraud ? Hey !You just skipped answering to REALLY important questions ! Let me re-quote the original post:Can we get an official explanation  please ? Are you scam or not ?  Then what the hell is this forum for ? What do you mean by "they will not bother responding to accusations" ?It's their goddamn job to respond to accusations, ESPECIALLY on this forum ESPECIALLY in this topic. Every public company that wants to have proper reputation has to respond to such accusations, and their response can tell us a lot about what kind of people they are. I will quote this just so more people are warned...Can we get an official explanation from BFL themselves please ? That is more than i asked for.Thank you, dear sir. No nickname there. Anybody could have made that. Not believable. When I'm going to see a photo of it with your nickname next to it, I may believe it. I'm still waiting for someone with proper reputation on the forums to actually show me a photo of a rig he received.Other that that, OK. Can you make a photo with your nickname and the rig next to it, so it can be confirmed that people actually receive these rigs ?I mean a lot of people with low posts counts are saying that they receive the rigs... But i haven't seen somebody with a LONG history on this forum who said he received one. Would it be possible for you guys to post photos of the rigs you receive so other people can see its real ?There are a lot of people with few posts saying that they received the rigs, but i don't know if they can be trusted. I'm just saying... That would be a game changer, and BTC rate would skyrocket 10-100 times in matter of a week.But nothing like this is going to happen. Agreed, seems definately legit.Gentelmen, It seems that giving this unknown guy all our money is the most logical course of action. +∞ This would be actually pretty awesome. 2012-08-15 Update:NFTF - version 0.6.3 released.Fresh tags - nftf-v0.6.3, nftf-v0.6.2.1 are avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsAlso, I may be making a new repo with Gentoo ebuilds avaiable soon, since I am creating them anyway for my Gentoo.So stay tuned. Internet started as a military project in 1962... So it belonged to army for about (23 ?) years before was released to the public ? So half the time internet existed it belonged to the army ?This actually strengthens my point even further. So what is the problem with mining pools exactly ?TCP/IP and the basic (layer 1 & layer 2 - meaning the FOUNDATIONS) protocols of the internet were created by the military. CERN only built on top of that.So it is logical that the military created the internet, and CERN only developed it further. Doesn't matter really. The day they open-sourced it, they lost control over it. Now everybody can benefit from Bitcoin, and nobody can control it without using **significant** money and resources. And I mean multi-billion-dollar-significant (however even that money doesn't guarantee success).The Internet is also a creation of the military. Who cares ?
There is no easy method of shutting down Bitcoin.This thread is going nuts... Haven't tried that yet, you are welcome to be the first  BTW, You just did a double-negative answer which could be understood by me as "yes you are right" (Just fooling around here, don't mind me) Actually i remember reading somewhere that this will be implemented in 0.7.Am I wrong ? WOW, there are monkeys on the interwebz ! I always suspected so, but never had any proof !(Not that i have anything against monkeys, they are great animals) * ShadowOfHarbringer is watching this. Sorry for not sleeping 2 hours a day so I can have time for reading every possible topic on this forum.Unfortunately i have a life and I sleep 8 hours a day.So yes, I am really missing this. What is this coincontrol about exactly ?Is it perhaps what i think it is - I mean ability to choose which coins to send when sending ? * ShadowOfHarbringer is watching this * ShadowOfHarbringer is watching this. I will just leave this here: So you will be better off asking about this the core developers (Gavin Andresen etc).But perhaps it is a common error. Try google first. Try compiling the mainline version and tell me if it produces the same error. This is a misunderstanding.I said:I i wanted to say that I am certain that it is 100% safe, i would say that "IT IS 100% SAFE" or "I AM CERTAIN THAT IT IS 100% SAFE".If that is not clear enough, i don't know what is. 2012-05-08 Update:NFTF - versions 0.6.0.7/0.6.1 & 0.6.2 released.Fresh tags -are avaiable for download as usual.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsTrunk code has also been merged from mainline client:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tree/ It just ignores the fee if there is high probability that it won't be necessary.It is quite safe for everyday usage, if you keep certain rules (eg. not resending money which don't have enough confirmations yet). Sending money which have at least 7 confirmations should be 100% safe, always. Glad i could help. Hmmm... this is indeed peculiar.However, there can be reasons it won't let you send without fee. For example, i believe the algorithm (in my fork and in official client) doesn't allow sending very small amounts, or amounts that does not have enough confirmations.I have not removed all safeguards against sending money without fee, just some of them.If you want to make sure it works as it should, you can build 0.3.21 version of the mainline client and compare the functioning of that with NFTF. If it is the same, then it works.Unfortunately, i dont't have time to test it now, because I am going on holidays. When I am back (about 8 april), I am going to test it thoroughly. Yes, i bring free har for everybody everyday !FREE HARS !! Har har har har....In no way is this a typo ! Don't even think about it ! I am aware of the network effect.My question was rather rethorical.What I am actually asking is: "what have we done do diminish MtGox influence ?"...You are actually trying to start discussion about whether Bitcoin is/will be successful and whether it is a good currency.But this is a matter for another discussion.
No brainer.All that happened in 2008-2009 is bound to happen again, because the old system stayed in place, nothing changed.But when it happens the next time, it will be impossible to save the current system - no bailouts will ever be big enough to help.If your children (banks,funds) are spoiled, then how should you correct them? By punishing them with rod (money cuts, bankrupcies) or perhaps giving them more candy (bailouts) ?OMG, this is going to be one one of the greatest economical collapses of all times. Just sit and watch. + e^xImho that's exactly what is going to happen. Yes, it is quite obvious that SOME of the governments will view BTC as threat. I didn't say how many governments, or which governments. Of course it is not. And we are not even talking about Bitcoin, but MtGox, specifically.But how does that matter to the US government ?They don't care what is and what isn't. They just call you a terrorist, send you to guantanamo and that is all. Stop crying man, nobody is saying that end of MtGox is end of Bitcoin.I am only saying it would be better if we encouraged people to use other exchanges more, so we can decrease the losses once Govt takes Gox over, that is all.Centralization is certainly a problem, but Bitcoin will prevail. Still, it is better to be more prepared for it, rather than sit and wait for the disaster while happily keeping all money at MtGox (which is kind of stupid and irresponsible).We cannot stop governments killing MtGox, but we can diminish the effect it will/would have on our economy. Every action we take counts. Hence my signature. Yeah, i guess you are right, nothing can really be done.Waiting untill shit hits the fan in progress... Because we could do something, and we do not. Doing something could decrease the future disaster which will happen after they close MtGox.The people who lose their money will become a problem.They will keep going around the internet and ranting that Bitcoin is unsafe because blah blah blah (which is obviously false, but still). So i guess we will be waiting until "shit hits the fan" instead doing something (even something small ?).But what is the harm of actually doing something instead of sitting still and waiting until that happens ? Is that a rule that is always fixed in space-time continuum, or perhaps people could actually change that if they started working together at least a little ? That too, but not enough."Normal" people will probably always view darknet as the tool of hackers/pedophiles/sociopaths/money launderers/whatever. OK, since nobody seems to be eager to do anything at all, i will add small ad in my signature.Its not much, but it is something. What i mean is that perhaps something more could be done than we are doing now.We could, for starters, inform all people that there are other exchanges through this forum. Wouldn't it be in the interest of whole Bitcoin economy to place an ad somewhere on the forum saying "Centralization of currency exchanges is bad for the Bitcoin network. If you are only using MtGox, try using some other exchanges like XXXX, YYYY, ZZZZ" ?----And before someone starts accusing me, I am _NOT_ working for any of the other exchanges. (Actually i planned to start an exchange myself, but the stupid law in my country killed the idea) It is quite obvious that in (maximum) few years some of world's Governments are going to start perceiving Bitcoin as a threat.When they do, first thing they are going to try is closing the biggest players (like MtGox, which allegedly is reponsible for 80% of all BTC trade in the world) to force the currency into underground.Taking megaupload takedown into consideration this scenario is IMHO not only probable, but inevitable.I wonder, is the market decentralized enough currently to support transition from big players to smaller, local markets ? I mean, shouldn't we all support different (other than MtGox) services so when government shuts it down, devastating effects of the catastrophe will be smaller ?Government will try to stop Bitcoin, that is only a matter of time. We kind of already know that is going to happen since the beginnings, so why so many people are still using MtGox ? Works for me. Kind of, yes.It took me 2 days to configure DKIM + SPF on one server (3 domains). Of course, I am not the best sysadmin, still learning.Theoretically it is easy, but when it comes to practice, there are A LOT of ways in which it can go wrong, believe me. I get that my arguments against it currently aren't very good. I just get a feeling (a "vibe") from this developer kit, that it's shiny and wonderful on the outside, but they spent much less time making it professional inside.We have a saying in my country - "Krowa, która dużo muczy, mało mleka daje", which directly translates to "A cow which does a lot of noise, gives little milk". Wisdom of the ages. Still current, after all these years. Oh, I'm just trying to be pessimistic here. You are not helping out.OK, it you want some arguments - it looks shiny and beautiful on the outside, but from the looks of it inside will be far far worse. Still, i might be wrong. This doesn't look very professional to me. Oh, it's just people bitching Atlas even though he is right this time.The usual. Lately almost everything lands in gmail spam folder.Their spam filters became crazy.PS.@Coinapult authorSo what about PGP support ? Is it planned at least ?
Q: Do you support sending PGP/GPG - encrypted emails ? They are afraid. Good. 1. Clearly, the technology is not open source2. It is not decentralized.End of story. This is in no way competition to Bitcoin at all.It only may be useful as a suplement to Bitcoin. (Well i guess I'm not used to people giving up so quickly in long discussions, but that's OK too) 1. You completely ignore sociological & geopolitical aspects of such an event. Such a large operation would be a direct proof that Bitcoin is a danger for current establishment, which could cause MASSIVE surge in publicity for Bitcoin, which would bring a lot of new people into mining business.Every action has a reaction, you simply CANNOT ignore that. Let's consider a scenario. Let's assume that FBI/CIA/Other US govt agencies start a new supercomputer, and gain 60% in one day. But there is no action without reaction. China & other countries who don't like USA immediately assume, that Bitcoin is probably a danger to US dollar and because China really wants to get rid of dollar, they put one of their newly built supercomputers into mining Bitcoins, so dollar will fall even more quickly.Also, other "wild" miners join the game - some (ideological) to protect Bitcoin, but most because USA admitting that Bitcoin is dangerous confirms that is it valuable. So not only the attacker's network share drops below 40 or even 30%, but Bitcoin value skyrockets.2. Increasing inflation by sunsetting old coins is in no way solution to this.So your entire reply is decidely not on topic (as is mine, unfortunately). Perhaps some ad servers are supplying unencrypted content.Using adblock might help.Also check out the fingerprint. Correct is 7D.3D.6A9495E4EE23C7A7C590BE1B3750BA84.D3.34 - SHA1 (i added the dots) * ShadowOfHarbringer is watchng this. Works for me ? But there is _NO_ problem. And there is _NO_ hard evidence that it will become a problem. 51% attack won't destroy the blockchain...Also 51% is actually not enough to perform massive scale attack. You should have few percent more, which is highly unlikely (for example, if deepbit became the adversary, large percent of users would stop using it instantenously).And we already have a contermeasure against 51% attacks - decentralized mining pools. If only people used them more often.So increasing inflation by any means is not necessary. What kind of solution is that ? This is common thievery, nothing else. We will return to this topic in 30 years, when it will be possible to verify these claims.For now, stick to the matter at hand. And the matter is, we don't need any fix for a problem that neither does exist yet or it is certain it will ever exist. I see yuur point, but you are not entirely on topic.The topic author is not suggesting to "sunset" coins for security reasons, but for some bullshit semi-inflational reasons, which is plainly wrong and destroys the sancrosanct rules of Bitcoin as Gavin said.Once the cryptography behind Bitcoin gets broken, I am sure that majority will agree that something needs to be done about old, insecure coins. In that case, i suppose it would be possible to re-hash the old coins somehow with new algorithm by sending them to a upgraded address using upgraded client.But that is a matter for completely different discussion. But we need to protect the children ! TOR is a tool used only by pedophiles. So TOR should be banned & deep-packet-inspection filtered out of the internet.Don't you want to protect the children ? Or perhaps you are some kind of pervert ?---Oh, i forgot to add that using cryptography should also be banned alltogether (for the common man at least).Specialised organs willbe providing licenses for using cryptography only for people who are thoroughly tested against pedophilia, perversion, schizophrenia and other mental disorders.After all, if you are a good person, then you have nothing to hide, don't you ?[/irony off, in case somebody didn't get it] So unless some serious event on a massive scale happens, we're doomed.Are people of the world going to become slaves of a new generation of world-wide fascism ?The future doesn't seem very bright for personal freedoms. Can anything at all be done about it ?Will we be telling our children that once wa had the thing called "internet" where everybody could share stuff and communicate freely ? "The news lies"In other news: water is wet and fire is hot.  Yes, I seriously believe that when you make something good, and it is free and open source, people will come and support you.That is the way Free Software works, it always has been this way since the dawn of GPL and Linux. This time is not different.So just make a better currency, advertise it, publish a whitepaper like Satoshi did, and repeat the success of Bitcoin. If your conception is worth it, people will follow. It is that simple.But perhaps the problem is, that the conception is not worth it, and this is why stealing other people's money through "wallet heartbeats" or some inflationary bullshit will fail. I am pretty sure they don't.However I am also assuming that CIA/FBI/Political Establishments/Whatever already have agents on the forum (after all they openly admitted their interests in Bitcoin) who will (probably) use every occasion to spread FUD, misinformation & propaganda.You never know who are you talking to or how many of them is already here. So it is important to stop inflationist lies sooner than later. +∞The moment someone starts to mess with my savings, I'm leaving this boat - and so will do many big players (Assuming of course that chain split wouldn't occur first).I seriously invite all those who want change the rules to make their own currency. I actually think there is a need for another inflata-coin in parallel to normal Bitcoin. But chainging the rules of this environment is absolutely out of the question. Correct.To compete with Bitcoin, any new virtual currency needs to open its sources first.Not opening sources immediately means that we cannot trust the currency creator. The conclusion is that this is another fiat money produced by another government, but this time it looks that they want to create a fully digital currency.However it will be a lot of fun to observe as they get reverse engineered by hackers/cryptographers around the world and fail.
Shouldn't his post be moved to the topic "deflation and bitcoin - the last words on this forum" ?We can't have the same discussion over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, can we ? This actually a totally awesome idea.+10 A mighty wizard we need to put a powerfull anti-resurrection spell a on this forums.I mean all the ancient magical topics get revived over and over and over again by young, foolish necromancers. We can't have this kind of power roaming freely the middle-earth. It may awaken the dead from their graves ! If i don't see source code posted anywhere, then i don't treat a digital currency seriously.Also, +1.MintChip itself is nothing like Bitcoin, but its existence is good for Bitcoin. I see no mention on the website about this.Actually, after watching the video and reading the website i still have no idea what is Mintchip all about.What I see is a lot of marketing mumbo-jumbo, evolution blah blah.  Apparently, they are not even open source.It doesn't look like serious Bitcoin competition to me. Rather an incompetent try to steal some people from Bitcoin environment. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/24/linux_kernel_randd_estimate_u_of_oviendo/It would cost approx. 1 bln of euros (old 2010 data, currently probably 50% more) for EU to make Linux.**And they still would not make it right**.I wonder how much would Bitcoin cost right now ? Hundereds thousands ? Programmers that can code Bitcoin aren't cheap - that i can tell. The issue you are talking about is a non-issue in the Open Source world.In free software world, if you don't like something, and you have valid logical arguments that something is wrong, then you make a fork, convince people and they will follow you (if you are "worthy" of course).The old times are gone. One can be truly free to choose between different software/digital currency systems, if only he desires it.If the things Gavin is doing were really bad, somebody would notice (sooner or later) - the openess of the source guarantees that. And scandal like that would surely fork the project. People would move to the new, better project. Justice is served.----So please, really - stop talking jibberish and give me arguments. Show what is so wrong in the code, that Gavin needs to be fired. Do a code review. Hire a programmer/software analyst/ to inspect Bitcoin's source. But if you have no such arguments, you can also shut up. 2012-03-25 Update:NFTF tags for mainline client versions v0.5.3rc1, v0.5.3rc2, v0.5.3rc3, v0.5.3rc4, v0.5.4rc1, v0.6.0rc2, v0.6.0rc3, v0.6.0rc4 released.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsTrunk/master has also been fully updated to the latest mainline version. * ShadowOfHarbringer is watching this. Gavin, i previously had my share of doubts whether are you are right man on the right place, but now i think you fit the position very well.Linus torvalds also wasn't a world-class genius when he started Linux kernel project. You surely have potential to become Linus of the Bitcoin world. You are completely out of place, mumbling like a small child which got lost and doesn't know where it is.Let me clearify some simple rules for you:- Open Source projects are **NOT** companies, neither they behave as one- Open Source projects are **NOT** ruled by shareholders.- Open Source projects are **NOT** ruled by money.- If you want something done well in Open Source world, do it yourself    - If you can't do it yourself, find somebody who can and pay him- If you don't like a project, just fork it or write it from the scratch (but you still have to convince people to use your version which will not be easy) I don't know if you have already figured it out or not, but if you want something done in Free Software world, you have to either do it yourself, or make somebody to do it for you.This is exactly what i did here, because nobody cared that i do not want to pay fees when they are not necessary.So the best option is probably to start a fork of your own (if you can code), or pay/convince somebody to do it. Well yeah - to be precise I am talking about versions that force fee even when there is high probability of it being completely unnecessary.All versions newer that 0.3.21 do that. This fork is only a simple patch to maintain the way things previously were, before developers introduced a change that is unfair and unacceptable by my standards.I have no intention (or required C/C++ skill) of taking it further.Perhaps somebody else will take up the challenge. 2012-03-21 Update:NFTF - version 0.5.3.1 [critical security vulnerability hotfix] released.Fresh tag - nftf-v0.5.3.1 is avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsMore updates (other tags, trunk) should follow soon. @upOK, thanks for clearing that matter up, guys. Clearly I was wrong, and P2SH is not as bad as I thought. Many thanks @etotheipi.Untill this post (and your other posts in BIP18 topic), i haven't collected enough data to make an opinion in the BIP16/BIP17 debate.Now I have a clear point on the matter: P2SH sucks totally and should be deprecated. A solution which requires backup of wallet after every [P2SH] transaction is flawed by definition. It has always been the standard that making a backup of wallet secures you for the future transactions (unless you generate more than 100 addresses in the wallet and use the 101-th generated address). This was a very good and well-thought over standard created by Satoshi himself. I find changing it highly irresponsible & potentially dangerous for the network.Unless, of course I am misunderstanding something (sb please correct me then). * ShadowOfHarbringer is watching this. Excellent. I will review the code, and if it is what i expect (and it gets pulled into mainline), then i will be able to stop maintaining this fork.Force strong is with you, Luke - big thanks.
Could everybody please stop derailing this topic ?I kind of wanted to use it to inform people about releases of NFTF. "Most cases" is still not satisfactory for me, hence the fork.I like my freedom served fresh & juicy on a plate.When the mainline client gets a proper "are you sure" dialog and/or a configuration setting "Always.AllowNoFees.IKnowWhatIamDoing = 0/1" implemented, this fork will become obsolete. Since then, i will continue maintaining it. The rule No. #1 is: Trust no one.So why would i trust some pre-defined "authority" ? This is like taking a time machine and going back to pre-bitcoin era.We are the Bitcoiners, we trust the code. Middleman are now obsolete. This might work, but using NFTF fork would probably be much easier & quickier solution. I actually made this fork to save "the old way" of doing transactions, so that it will not be forgotten.You can use my code to implement the override properly, as the only thing it does (2 lines of code changed) is it reverts the client behavior to pre-0.3.23 one.It should be extremely easy to add an extra configuration switch/parameter/whatever, so you can choose between default Satoshi-client-behavior mode, or NFTF-client-behavior mode when creating a transaction.I am happy to see that my fork can be actually useful for something important. I'm quite devastated by this topic.It seems that namecoin is doomed from the start. Why didn't the NMC developers account for that ? Yes, exactly.The only mandatory fees that are not-really-so-mandatory are the ones which were introduced around 0.3.23.The first conception of my fork was to remove necessity of any fee. But removing other requirements can be IS dangerous (network would not relay such transacactions or other weird errors could happen) so i dumped that idea. A suggestion - If you want to be really useful, try coding a proper dialog like "Are you sure you really want not to include a fee ? Transaction may never be confirmed !" or/and a configuration setting in the bitcoin.conf file, so that power users/people who know what they are doing can send whatever transaction they want to.Right now, this fork is not a "proper" solution. With a patch like that, it could become good enough to be pulled into the main bitcoin tree perhaps. OMG, WHY in the world did you have to tell me this ?Now i will have to execute a (surely) long, difficult (if even possible) process of changing my nickname on all of the Bitcoin forums !Ohhh the pain... It's unbearable. Surely, this is not all a coincidence.We must remember that CIA is oficially & unoficially "interested" in Bitcoin. That may mean many things. They may be trying to either manipulate the currency to their advantage or destroy it, or perhaps both.These guys aren't stupid. You are absolutely right, however still missing the point.It is my risk to take and whether i still want to gamble and send the coins should be my decision.This is why i bugged mainline devs multiple times for a simple configuration setting or a simple "are you sure" dialog, or both.They are acting like the issue doesn't exist at all. Why is a simple configuration setting such a problem ? Open source is all about choice. @gmaxwellOK, seems you were right. Thanks for pointing that out, i could not notice it myself.Some "weird magic" happened during my git patchwork, and some conflicts didn't merge properly.The errors were so serious though that the program would probably not compile (at least i hope so). Lucky the changes were only visible for a couple of hours.Updated & fixed tags are now avaiable, the old ones were removed. Everything is now merged properly, including the trunk.Also, from now on i will always diff all tags & trunk with mainline client in case of some more merge errors. Actually, I did a 2-level testing.First, i tested the "normal" client to check if it adds fees. Then i did an identical transaction with identical sum of money.And guess what. The mainline client ALWAYS (state as of december 2011) wants a fee when you resend money that are younger than 30 minutes.My client does not. And the transaction produced by my client got confirmed easily (up to 2 hours).Well, actually i think you may be at least partially right here.I will remove the "getting robbed by miners" ad, and replace it with something "lighter".This is interesting.Gitk shows that my branch is fully merged with master, except for my little patch.I will diff it myself now and show you the results in a few minutes.There is a "cautionary" big, red warning in the first post, shouldn't that be enough ? Completely untrue, at least it was few months ago (i am not sure if current state is similiar, because i didn't have time to test it lately).The official client adds fees, even when they are completely unnecessary - meaning they get relayed and confirmed without any fee.Do some testing before you make claims such as this. I did such tests on my fork with only 2 confirmations (and small sums - like 0.02, 0.10) , and guess what. Fees were NOT necessary. Ever.Also, there is a proper warning at the start of this topic.You miss the point.I want to have freedom to choose whether i want to pay fees that may or may not be necessary.This is MY FREEDOM, not developer freedom to decide what to do. This is the exact reason i created this simple patch.Also, as i already stated somewhere in this topic, **this is not a "proper" fork, just a simple 2 line - patch ** for people who value freedom of choice the same as I do.The **proper** fork/patch should implement a dialog saying "Are you absolutely sure that you do not want to include fee ? Your money may be lost in the process".Of course, it wasn't my intention for the patch to remove ALL fees. It only removes the necessity of paying the fee which started around 0.3.23.It reverts the client behavior to the one from 0.3.20.Unfortunately, I do not posess enough C/C++ skill (as i already mentioned above), but i do posess the skills to read&understand C/C++ code (to a certain degree) and do pretty advanced git patchwork.This is all I am doing here, nothing more is really required to maintain a 2-line patch for God's sake.This is your choice. Because you see: It is all about choice. My choice was to create this fork for myself and other people who value individual freedom and are willing to take some risks to achieve that freedom. 2012-02-12 Update:NFTF - versions 0.5.2 & 0.6.0rc1 released.NOTE: From now on i will also include release candidate (rc) tags in my fork.Fresh tags - nftf-v0.5.2, nftf-v0.6.0rc1 are avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsTrunk code has also been merged from mainline client:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tree/ On testnet perhaps ?Gavin said he's already done some testing on testnet, but the question is if that was enough.Perhaps people with considerate mining power should do some more heavy testing. +1 to that.Let's go slow, and do a lot of testing before implementing something that breaks backward compatibility.It is people's money that is at stake here, so there is no place for "we feel" this is good.You must KNOW that something is good and well tested before implementing it. That is OK, as long as the discussion will be completely public. Openess is the fundament of any Open Source project.Perhaps we should create a mainling list read-write for developers and read-only for all others  ?Or it could be done on the forums, so it is even more public. Mmm, somebody with great necromancy powers I sense, yes.Topic so long dead reviving... Which is what i said.Yeah i have seen it, but i don't remember the Topic ID. Could somebody supply a link ? Whoah, this went definately too easy.I mean, how decentralized are we, really ? What if US took over 5 biggest pools and having ~65% the next day we would have massive scale attacks on the network ?That would be a disaster. Perhaps a temporary one, but still a disaster. How long do you think it will take before they try something like this ?Shouldn't we all push for decentralized pools, like P2Pool ?
+1 to OP.The centralization of pools is currently probably the weakest point of Bitcoin currently. We should remember that CIA/FBI/Governments/Banks/Whatever can have extremely large amounts of money & fire/manpower to bribe/intimidate pool operators. This should be fixed as soon as possible. @etotheipiOut of curiosity:What is your stance on BIP 0016 ?https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0016https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=56969.0 You know Gavin - after some thinking i understand that we need to constantly move forward, but you are perhaps going too fast about this.Shouldn't there be a longer wait period before implementation of something that can split chains ?I mean this is a serious change. Shouldn't this be programmed in a way so that it is activated at, for example, block 190.000 ? This way we would lower the risk of splitting chains & stuff.Why the rush ? This may be actually dangerous for the network. Can't we have more time to adapt ? The issue you are discussing is way too complex for me to understand, however i got an idea:Can we perhaps invite all developers (who already wrote "some" Bitcoin code) here to vote on this before implementing in the mainline client ?Perhaps a closed dev-only poll (done with posts) would suffice. I just saw the episode and it is absolutely INCREDIBLE !I mean, of course it had a lot of usual stupidities and simplifications so average american is not bored (like "Mr. Bitcoin is such an awesome haXX that only he can change the bitcoin code and embed something in the blockchain" - LOL), but overall, the episode was much much better than I thought.What i mean to say is I expected it to be far more foolish and inaccurate. They actually got about 90% of the important details **right**, except for that creating currency is not illegal in the US. They even included the currency vs commodity dispute which is often brought up on the forums.I am also impressed by the number of times they actually used the word "Bitcoin" in it. It was like they were really trying to advertise it !I may consider actually watching "The Good Wife" after this, even though i don't like the "law-drama" genre very much. Untrue.Proxychains actually proxies DNS through its chains ! It also works well with TOR (also tested myself).This fancy thing even works with advanced apps (GUI apps). Code:# proxychains ./armory_executable will probably work well on most Linux/BSD/UNIX-like systems.http://proxychains.sf.net/If it even works with SSH (checked myself), it should work with most of apps. Oh, that's a good one. Don't know the answer to that either. Assuming anybody actually reads these things. Leaked Memo Says Apple, Nokia, RIM Provide Backdoor To Governments...so think again if you plan to use Bitcoin on your IPhone.http://apple.slashdot.org/story/12/01/08/069204/leaked-memo-says-apple-provides-backdoor-to-governmentshttp://www.zdnet.com/blog/india/have-rim-nokia-apple-provided-indian-military-with-backdoor-access-to-cellular-comm/838 So people stop creating new ones, messing up the forum.If you read the first post BTW, you wouldn't ask such questions. Excellent ! The right approach.You already did what i asked the mainline devs for (many times), and they never complied, even though making a simple setting in configuration file is not that much coding really.I will give your client some testing and perhaps i will be using it as my default BTC client some day. * ShadowOfHarbringer is watching this 2012-01-07 Update:NFTF - version 0.5.1 released.A fresh tag - nftf-v0.5.1 is avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsTrunk code has also been merged back:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tree/ @etotheipiI am sure you are aware that in the current implementation of the mainline Bitcoin client, transaction fees are forced even when not necessary (which is the reason i created the fork of mine).So, does your client allow no-fee transactions ? Multiple signatures for single transaction ?Simply GENIUS. This is effectively a built-in escrow service ! The ramifications of this will be simply **disastrous** for fiat-money-based economy. Now credit cards & bank accounts "security" looks more like an April's fool joke comparing to Bitcoin.I have just read about this, and i came here right away.Excellent work, Gavin & others. There is a new awesome article about Bitcoin on BitcoinMedia.(A little TL;DR though)My congratulations, Genjix !//BTW, Before somebody asks, I was not asked/told/paid/forced/whatever by Genjix to write this post.//I just noticed it fits this forum, so here ya go. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/30/jefferson-memorial-dancing-arrests_n_868719.htmlhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWeF6lwg4aY Actually last time they themselves didn't know if it was quantum (!!) or not, are they sure this time ?Or did they also invent Quantum Trolling Technology ? +2
Wisdom of the ages...I wasn't aware of this. Me likes this.+1 to donate button. I just looked up your code and you definately do not allow free transactions, just like the mainline client.This is the code responsible (src/wallet.cpp):Code:                bool fAllowFree = CTransaction::AllowFree(dPriority);                int64 nMinFee = wtxNew.GetMinFee(1, fAllowFree);In my fork i change it to following, to revert to default 0.3.20 behavior, which allows sending coins without fee, always.Code:                //Bitcoin NFTF Patch - by ShadowOfHarbringer START                bool fAllowFree = true;                int64 nMinFee = wtxNew.GetMinFee(1, fAllowFree);                //Bitcoin NFTF Patch - by ShadowOfHarbringer ENDHowever this is not a proper fix, but a quick & dirty fix.If you are interested in "good fix", there is a patch for the mainline client created by Luke-Jr here.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=46925.msg639340#msg639340 2011-12-03 Update:NFTF - version 0.5.0 released.A fresh tag - nftf-v0.5.0 is avaiable for download.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagsTrunk code was also updated:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tree/ Probably, however the question is: will this be merged into the mainline client ? But did you merge forced non-zero TX fees from Bitcoin ?If so, then paytxfee setting might not work in some cases.Current bitcoin client forces everybody to pay fees even if they are not necessary.This is the reason why i created NFTF Bitcoin client fork.Is this the case with namecoin ? There is a very simple answer to that.MtGox is building a fractional reserve, trying to make more money on the money they already have. They are very probably investing money of their users using external entities. It's a no-brainer.No, they are slowly killing themselves.It's good for bitcoin, we need more serious exchanges and less crappy exchanges.It is possible to actually create a totally hardened, hack-free exchange without crazy withdrawal limits, but not everybody is competent enough for the job.MtGox will be replaced by better exchanges - sooner or later. It's called free farket. +1I also do have multiple clients on few servers running currently. You must be living in USA, UK or Australia.Here, in central europe ALL wired broadband plans are unlimited and this is considered a standard. Of course mobile/wireless ones are always limited, but i guess that's normal & understandable.It seems that in some things, "developing" countries are more advanced than "developed" countries. Curious. Maybe they want you to think that they are incompetent.Also, there may be other government agencies, which are more effective.The point is, if the CIA is aware of Bitcoin, all the other "shady" government agencies surely are.From my point of view, there is at least 96% probability that this is an obvious hoax.However, you always have to consider all the possibilities. Even the least probable. Perhaps, but they still can put a bullet in your head and get away with it. Also they potentially posess large amounts of money which allows them to manipulate everything. I would not be surprised at all if that was the truth, since CIA openly admitted their interest in Bitcoin, which means one of tho things: they either want to use it for their dirty buisnesses, or they want to destroy it.However I need some proof to verify this as "legit" than text from some forum user who could be God knows who...@Mageant: How do we know you are not working for CIA conducting a psychology study to find out how will we behave if you tell us this ?You never know... However, this would actually also prove that they themselves are looking for ways to manipulate this community into doing what they want... Tricky thing this conspiracies are, indeed. Just a small correction, that was bitomat.pl you are talking about.Unfortunately that is soooooo correct. This is the direct reason of why monopolies & shady buisnesses exist. Because they gained critical mass required for network effect.And when "everybody" uses something, people just don't give a duck about the risks. Typical herd behavior. +1We have to fight our way through, there is a very high probability that it will not be possible to cooperate with the establishment.Bitcoin is the new gold standard. Establishment hates gold, because it is harder to manipulate it and steal from general public using inflation. We are the BitBorg. Abolish your currencies and surrender your banks.We will add your economical and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your economy will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile. Yeah, we had a bubble, it bursted, we lived through.It was kinda obvious that this would happen and many people were saying that over and over again.Now, can such useless topics as this be closed after they become totally & absolutely offtopic ?I mean what is the point of existance of such a long offtopicked topics ? Does anybody even bother to read through them ? I seriously doubt so.Perhaps all topics that are completely "used", should have their discussion moved to another [EMPTY] topic with changed title ? This is exactly what I said, using different words.I also said that in certain special circumstances (as when economy is shrinking while money supply is stable), there a natural inflation can occur.But AFAIK from history, i don't remember it ever happening in the last 100-200 years, and this is why i called it "special circumstances". You have no idea what you are talking about.Inflation IS printing money. Printing money IS inflation. If you don't print money, the average price of everything will not rise in the long term (because when money supply is fixed, and number of goods is increasing, light deflation is a natural thing) , unless there are some special circumstances.This is why gold is ALWAYS rising in the long term - because the supply is rising very slowly, while number of goods which you can buy for it rises much faster (as we are producing more and more faster and faster). OK sorry, misunderstood. I heard some time ago that FBI/CIA stated that they can read data from hard drives that has been zero-filled once or twice.Perhaps you should do it few more times, with random data every time instead of just zeros.
So you are actually serious about writing the software completely from scratch ?This way it will take YEARS to achieve the number of features of the current forum, unless it is based on one of existing forum systems. And you have *completely no guarantee* that it will be in any way faster or more secure than ANY of the existing systems.This is madness. So there could be multiple centralized systems with a different blockchain for each other.... Hmmm.I think I like the idea. Multiple centralized coins =~ decentralization. But how do you make sure that every coin is worth exactly 1 USD ?To control the price, there would have to be an entity who controll the supply of the currency and the currency would essentially become centralized. There is no other way.Who could be such issuer ? More information + Slashdot comments are here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=49726.msg591482#msg591482 I hope you are right, however I am a pessimist or a realist. I hope it is the former, but i fear it is the latter. The state cares.Using anylysis of what books you buy, they can analyse your psychological profile, how you behave, where you go every weekend, or if you are a disident/oppositionist.Actually, I CAN DO IT EASILY if I have enough statistical data (I am a programmer). If I can do it means not only they can do it, but they are already doing it.After they determine you are a "threat", they either make you a non-rejectable offer, or they simply come at night and you are never heard from again.I live in a post-communist country, so i know how this works. At first, they eleminate the handful that oppose the strongest. Then the next, weaker opposition, and then level lower and so on. Before you know it, there is nobody that opposes them (the only left are opportunist carcass and cowards) - and boom, there ya go - totalitarian state.Do you think that totalitarian regimes are made in one day ? No, it is a slow process, exactly as the one that is happening now. I will just leave this here...http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/10/24/1542240/the-147-corporations-controlling-most-of-the-global-economyhttp://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1107/1107.5728v2.pdf Either he is paranoid, or you are naive.There are people who like their privacy and don't want whole world to know about everything they do.Also, I have a famous quote for you: @GavinAny chance for including this in 0.5.x ?https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/570 HahahahahahaThis discussion is getting really fun ! Wait, let me grab some beer. Wait, isn't somebody already working on a "Bootstrap" feature ?Downloading the full blockchain from torrent sites and processing them using client would be definately the fastest option. Torrents also have built-in checksums, so they seem to have enough security.  You certainly have a valid point.However, it will be impossible to keep any order and forums will be a permanent mess with scammers, spammers and such. People will get scammed every day, and BTC reputation will suffer.Which is exactly what is happening now BTW. I have accounts on multiple forums, and the ones that have reputation system are the least messy & spammed.This system can be tweaked, so only posts of people with the worst reputation can be hidden, and only if they are seriously downvoted.System can be tuned so that only obvious trolls are removed from discussion. That is not an excuse for a serious financial institution. This shit is really annoying.Tradehill:Can't you post updates (on your blog) about how the server repairs are coming, for Christ's sake ?I checked yesterday and TH.com was down, exactly as it is today.We can't we behave like serious people instead of pissing on each other ?How do you expect this currency to be EVER taken seriously if you run your buisness like this ? 1. You don't even know how the system works, and yet you speak.2. Also, moderation depends on what majority thinks, and on this forum majority is noobs. So there won't be any kind of "circle" of self-adoration.3. Normal mods would still have greater power than rest of the people4. To some degree, sooner or later every forum becomes a circle of people-with-similiar-mindsets who adore themselves and reject incompatibile mindsets, so your point is invalid. Looks down from here.Just decide: are you going to be the next big scam exchange or not ?BTW,I am really tired of scammers fucking with my favourite currency.Can't people just start making serious buisnesses based on Bitcoin instead of being annoying ?Satoshi (whoever he is) gave us the greatest possible gift, which could liberate us from the central banks, and look what do we do with it. Scams. Watching this.Also, awesome idea. Not necessary.Slashdot-like meta-moderation system is waaaaaaay better.It allows users gaining reputation, stops 99+% of spam, hides 95% of useless posts and can work similarly to FB/Google's +1. I actually can't wait until BTC gets back to $1.00, so I can buy even more at cheaper prices.But somehow i feel that it will start rising too early, and again i will be left with not enough bitcoins....
You still have monthly bandwidth limits ?OMG, and people say that my country is so called "developing world".Currently i have 6Mbit at home & 20Mbit at work, no B/W caps at all.But speeds up to 50 or even 100Mbit (uncapped of course) are avaiable in different regions of the city. Excellent news.For those of you that do not understand this yet: These (mainstream) media (by "mainstream" i mean forbes, i don't know about ars & wired) are our enemies as they support the current (banking) system. Anything they say cannot be taken seriously as it is hostile propaganda. They also were getting us a lot of unneeded attention from large speculators, which could even more destabilize BTC market (again) if they entered it too early.The sooner large media lose their interest in us and stop affecting our economy, the better.When they (finally) leave us alone, we will flourish. What we need is stable, progressive, slow development, not insane speed and insane bubbles (what we just witnessed). Touché. I think you may be both right, it is caused by both of these things.Also another one is a lot of bad Bitcoin-related press lately.As I said, psychology. Trust or distruct does not affect Bitcoin qualities at all.It is just people who do not understand them.Gold is not made significantly less worthy because of any kind of "distrust". Bitcoin is similiar.+1 Only a technological weakness can really kill Bitcoin.The current price craze is only because of psychological aspect of society. Also Bitcoin is a new, developing market so things like this are expected.People's moods are like weather - they change often and with little reason. Zero-days usually get patched on Linux within 24-48 hours, with unofficial patches avaiable within few hours (if we are talking Linux kernel). On Microsoft Windows, it may take weeks, months, or not get patched at all (i think there maybe currently at least one critical thing that has been unpatched for years, but i'm not 100% on that).Whether all the sysadmins in the world really follow & install the latest patches is another story.And that doesn't seem to stop your posting on the forum ? I am amazed. That Microsoft != Security.Using "Microsoft" or "Windows" with "Security" in one sentence is generally not a good idea, unless it describes a failure.BTW, you seem to be a scammer. But you forgot that you had to wait few weeks or months for each of them (including 0-days). Yes it has, because you gave WinXp as an example.WinXP is not a good example of how to call something "supported" or not.Microsofty-supported != generally-supported. To be precise, if something is supported, then that means all security vulnerabilities should be fixed.So it is the latest, in the terms of being most patched, version from 1.x branch.And Microsoft is a very bad example of how to fix security vulnerabilities, that company is fucked up beyond compare. You are wrong, SMF 1.x is still supported, so it was the latest version. Of course you are not aware that Bitcoin Forums has been quite recently hacked, and it was SMF's fault ?I wouldn't say that SMF is any more secure than other forums. I have had default PHPBB 2.x & 3.x installations on my sites for years, and guess what - no hacks at all.So be careful when you post such bold claims next time. Theymos, I say stay with the SMF 1.x, hire a PHP security expert to harden it properly, and build on top of it. That maybe the fastest & most effective solution to current situation.Of course, PHPBB, vBulletin and IPB are much more powerful and have many more plugins avaiable, but this one is not that bad, if you fix all the security problems. Talking perfomance, using dedicated well-written caching you can probably achieve similiar speed in any of the forum systems. I absolutely support this patch.Not allowing me do what i want with my money was the exact reason i created "No forced TX fee" fork.People should be given a choice, ALWAYS - that is all Open Source is about. There should be an expert switch, preferably in bitcoin.conf, and additionally --force parameter should be specified in bitcoind/JSON-RPC when user wants to send transaction without fee/with lower fee - so we can have absolute certanity that the user knows what he is doing.Also, a warning message of some sort could be returned after payment is sent to give user further information about what he just did. WOW, this patch actually fixes the forced TX fees annoyance (which made me make my own Bitcoin fork).Awesome job. I guess I won't have to maintain the fork anymore if this gets into mainline client. What do you mean ?Obviously you are aware that CIA invited Gavin Andresen to a closed-doors conference ? Use google, read the forums. People seriously need to start making real buisnesses instead of fake scam exchanges all the time.I am thinking some of this fake exchanges may be CIA/Govt job, maybe they finally decided Bitcoin is a threat and it needs to be destroyed (they openly admitted their involvement in BTC after all).  Just by the way, to whoever runs that site:The emails shouldn't just be put in plain text out there, too easy for spambots to get them.Perhaps some scrambling or javascript should be used to hide the adresses. You can achieve practically the same using multi-round, multi-algorithm, multiple salts hashing. Makes the hashed password databases useless as long as people are using long (>  passwords.
Sorry, but if i had 100 posts, not 1000, i would still say that your argumentation is a complete bullshit.I really admire kjj and BitterTea for wasting time with you. You just don't get simplest things. Your whole point is illogical, false and based on wrong assumptions and facts.But keep going, just let me grab some popcorn. Can be rigged both ways. That is the point.But i would rather suspect it is rigged "your" way.It's not because you are not getting it.I am not in a hurry anywhere. I think i rather won't cross 2k posts in the next year, unless something special happens.Also, 1k posts in over a year is really nothing extraordinary. Additionally the poll in the topic may very well be rigged, as SMF currently does not support blocking votes of people with less than X posts and registered longer than Y days.Also, it is pointless to discuss with Suggester, as he just doesn't get it. Oh, seriously ?Sorry, didn't have time to read the whole topic in detail.Anyway, scam exchanges are even worse for the currency than badly secured exchanges, so my point stands. And BTC/USD went down to 4.60 right away.Until people (especially exchanges owners) start to take security more seriously, Bitcoin will not take off.Creating an exchange that doesn't have bank-grade or better level of security is a complete waste of time. Actually you are quite right, it's the opposite.After 14 years in software development I can be quite sure that the first version is practically never the best. Sorry, theymos. There is a high condensation of cryptogeeks on this forum, such a feature is an obvious obviousness.Also,  No. You just still do not comprehend how many features that is.Creating your own forum system is a complete waste of time. Unless you want to spend few years creating it, perfecting it, fixing bugs & cooperating with community (the same as you do with Bitcoin), then forget it. 1. I am not sure If you comprehend just how many totally BASIC (no ponies & gadgets, just the basics) features modern forum systems (such as PHPBB) have. It is year of work at minimum for 3 experienced people to implement PHPBB's engine in a secure, performant way. And I am not even talking about the plugins - that's different story.1a. I know it LOOKS easy. But it totally isn't. Building a good piece of discussion software is a tough job, and other teams (PHPBB, MyBB, IPBB, vBulletin) had years and years and years to perfect their engines. You are simply **NOT** going to produce anything better in a short time (unless you are genius or something). Period.2. Another point is that people coming to the forum will expect certain set of features they encountered on other forums. If we don't have them, the forum will simply suck donkey arse from the point of view of users. Trust me, advanced board systems such as PHPBB, vBulletin or IPBB offer sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many features that you are never, ever going to catch up with them. Also, it can be really difficult to avoid security holes, unless there are many very very experienced people working on it.The best idea is to take one of the existing popular ones, add some basic plugins and build on top of them.Also, they can be optimized to be blazingly fast with advanced caching systems using memcache & ramdisks. Slashdot-like meta-moderation system would be neat. I think it is the best on the web.They actually eleminated 99,9% of spam & trolling using it. This could come in handly, as we currently have large trolling, spam and too-many-meaningless-posts problem. Slashdot moderation would probably eleminate them all, mostly at least. Still, shouldn't Bitcoin protocol be more predictable, like there will be exactly X coins in circulation at specified time ?Not allowing miners to generate more than 50 BTC, while simulataneously allowing them to generate less than 50 BTC is little weird from programmer's point of view. Why should  < 50 BTC blocks be counted as valid, while blocks > 50 BTC be counted as invalid ?Why wouldn't this work both ways ? So you are saying that we should allow miners to generate tons of invalid blocks with 0 BTC as output ?What about if a mining pool gets hacked and produces thousands of blocks of which each will yield 0 BTC ? This is a possible attack vector. It is more difficult to compile anything on windows by default.If you want to EASILY compile things, move to an Open Source UNIX-like system (such as Linux), which is designed for ease of compilation by default.However, having a proper ./configure script on UNIX/Linux wouldn't hurt. For now it is not possible to do the following on the Bitcoin client sources:Code:./configuremakemake installWhich is a little annoying. Other then that, compilation on UNIX is not problematic. Having an automatic update feature opens a whole world of possible security breaches and it could potentially damage the network.Consider the following scenario:1. Automatic update servers are cracked, 2. Depending on the attacker (casual thief or government) a trojan OR modifiied client is planted in place of the legitimate client3. 80% of users download the fake clientNow, there are 2 options:4a. The hacker steals wallets of 80 percent of the bitcoin users. OR4b. The hacker uses the modified client to damage the network, split chains, implant child pornography into chain or whatever else5. ?? ??6. PROFIT !Such damage could be fatal to the network and could actually destroy the people's faith in the currency.So no, having an automatic update feature is definately NOT a good idea. + 1 Unfortunately, there isn't anything like that. Read here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=45259.0This is the exact reason why i created my fork. There isn't any way to force sending money without any fee currently. Let me sum up for you what would happen in short IF the developers increased the money supply:1. The blockchain would split into the NEW chain (with more inflation) and the OLD chain (with unchanged inflation)2. Most of people, including me, would abandon the NEW chain and go back to OLD chain3. Bitcoins from the NEW chain would enter a downward spiral until they would become worthlessSeriously, who would want to be robbed ? And that is exactly what increased inflation is - common thievery. Exactly. That could be a serious weakness in the protocol.Why would all other clients accept such blocks ?Shoudn't there be a rule that only allows relaying/accepting of completely valid and "full" blocks ?For example: if a huge mining pool suddenly breaks down and starts producing blocks which earn 0 BTC to the network, then a lot of BTC could be lost in the process. More important questions:1. Was that expected when the Bitcoin protocol was designed, or is this something new ?2. Is it proper for a block to generate 49.99999999 bitcoins instead of the usual 50 ? Where did the 0.00000001 bitcoins go ?3. If it is not proper, why wouldn't the network reject such a block ?
Good point.Why not implement 1024 rounds + 1024 rounds of each of other hashes (like whirlpool, tiger or ripemd) in some next version ? 2011-09-24 Update:NFTF - version 0.4.0 released.Also:- Removed all the messy git tags merged previously from the mailine client- Created new, clean tag for NFTF-0.4.0- Minor cosmetic changes in commentsSo from now on, code will be organized in tags, not versions - as it should be from the beginning.0.4.0 code is avaiable in the tag:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tree/nftf-v0.4.0/And trunk code is avaiable from the trunk, as always. I usually only update it on major version changes or important features/bugfixes, so don't expect me to keep up with mainstream client developers all the time.Trunk: https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tree/Also, i have performed few tests, sending back and forth small amounts of BTC (0.01) having only 2 confirmations, and it seems that my fork is stable enough for the payments to get confirmed easily (up to 2 hours) without using any fees. I can probably easily detect something very suspicious in code when I analyse small parts of it, and I am not ever a proper C/C++ programmer.Imagine what an experienced, "everyday-C++" guy can do given a week of time. Perhaps even review entire code for backdoors. Stop panicking and spreading unnecessary paranoia.This is open source world. The "old" ways don't apply.As long as we have the Bitcoin source, nobody(or everybody) controls the currency. No company can take over an open source project. Ever. Today I have merged back the commit from trunk which fixes an unfairly high fees that have to be paid to the miners sometimes due to a bug re-introduced in 0.3.24.For details see the discussion here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=45259.0The patch is/will be already present in 0.4x version of official client, but i have also merged it back into 0.3.21, 0.3.22, 0.3.23 and 0.3.24 versions - for people who like to use older and more tested apps.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/commits/nftf-0.3.21https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/commits/nftf-0.3.22https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/commits/nftf-0.3.23 (that version already contained the patch)https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/commits/nftf-0.3.24If you have used trunk version, it already contained the patch, merged back from official client.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/Enjoy your no-unnecessary-fee transactions !As always, wait for at least 7 confirmations before re-sending money so you lower the risk of transaction not being accepted by the network. Excellent, thanks.I will merge it into my fork.Hopefully, it won't be too difficult for me to merge it into older versions also (< 0.3.24).Update:I checked and my forked version already contains this patch, but thanks nevertheless.Edit2:I will now try to apply it from trunk into nftf-0.3.24 branch and older versions.Edit3:I successfully merged the patch into following branches:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tree/nftf-0.3.21https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tree/nftf-0.3.22https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tree/nftf-0.3.23 (was already patched)https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tree/nftf-0.3.24I added proper announcement:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=22434.40 Can you point me to the particular piece of code ? Is TruCoin involved in mining by any chance ? Can you please point me to the exact source (line of code) ?I will also remove it from my fork.I didn't know that fee-skimming scams got so serious these days. No, we are talking about not giving user the choice whether he/she should risk his/her money and send the bitcoins without any fee.Also, check out this topic: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=22434.0;allBTW,Today i did a small test. I re-sent 0.10 BTC having only 2 confirmations to another address, without paying a fee (using my modified client). The resulting transaction was low priority.Guess what. It was sent without any problems, got 6 confirmations after about 2 hours.So I wouldn't say that forced transaction fees are so needed. I think that involving lawyers is not so necessary.This is an open-source project, everybody can write their own client. Also, it is a choice of the collective what fees will be enforced. If too many people will be annoyed by fee-skimming, they will move to forked clients, such as mine.The reasons why people are not rioting against it are probably1) Larger fees do protect the network from penny flooding attacks2) This is not annoying enough (yet). Nice !However I will not be using an untested code in prod evironment.I hope it will be added to mainline client in the future. Perhaps.Unfortunately I don't do advanced C++ programming, so I cannot do it myself anyway.Also there seems to be a lot of unwillingness among current developers for working on any solution to this problem.That however does not surprise me, as the major devs probably invested heavy money into mining rigs, so why would they damage their business ?An easy & quick solution could be for example, to return error if transaction fees are set to 0.00, and requested transaction requires a fee.But obvious mining cartel is obvious. That is not a problem really.The method i proposed could work the following way, by "preparing" the transaction:1. Make the rand() and prepare the transaction + calculate fees2. The transaction is stored in a "prepared" or "locked" state - all bitcoins from the transaction are locked, until the transaction is unlocked by user.3. If the user likes the fees, he confirms the transaction, it becomes unlocked, and it is then relayed to the network.This shouldn't be extremely hard to implement. Actually, i am running my own fork of Bitcoin, which does not enforce fees.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=22434.0;allhttps://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/I just wanted to know, if there is a way to do it without using modified clients. Hello,While developing a bitcoin-related app, i have stumbled upon some seriously annoying shit.The problem is that apparently, using the default client's bitcoind, there is currently no way to determine what the transaction fee is going to be, before sending money ! (So i could, for example, tell the user how much will he be paying BEFORE he sends the money).Should there be a method in the API like "checksendtransactionfees <address> <amount>" ?Can somebody correct me please if am I wrong here? Update:It would appear that the unstripped version is not production safe. It damaged the database and now when i try to run normal (non-compiled) client, it crashes with following error:EDIT:Actually, I can only run compiled versions now, the binary version from bitcoin.org crashes every time i try to launch it using the same database. Any ideas ?Perhaps different version of BerkeleyDB on my debian system or whatever ? I have just compiled it and it is also 17 MB...So you are saying this is completely normal, and i have absolutely nothing to worry about, including running that version on production servers ? No. A honest ponzi scheme is no longer a deception/fraud and is no longer morally negative, as bitplane said below:Exactly.Volenti non fit injuriaIf you do something willingly and consciously ergo there is no harm done. If somebody risks his money and he knows what he is doing, then it is his freedom and his problem if he loses the money.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volenti_non_fit_injuria Trolls will be quickly destroyed by lowering their reputation.And also only users having 50+ posts [the posts also cannot be rated too negatively] and registered for at least 3 months will get moderation rights. This way it is extremely hard for trolls to overcome legitimate users, even if they outnumber them many times.Additionally, "real" forum moderators may lower the reputation of persons behaving extremely badly even further.
Make a poll and you will find that this is probably not very good idea.What we need, is a semi-automatic slashdot-like meta-moderation system.It effectively filters out ~99,5% of trolling & spam.Moderation is done partially by random forum users. It works really great. I don't remember when i have read any serious spam on Slashdot last. Let me quote something for you:As you are an insolent fool, which doesn't understand a thing about hashing algorithms and you failed to explain how bcrypt actually works, let me explain you in my own words what this description means.Roughly the eksblowfish is all about creating multiple keys, of which each is mixed with salt, and then each of the keys is applied in each of multiple rounds of the algorithm. Each next (n+1) round begins in mixing the key with salt and applying it to the previous (n) round through encryption. In other words, bcrypt() is simply a recurrent hashing algorithm, where each consecutive round of hashing begins with adding the salt to the result of previous round. Exactly as the algorithm which I have written.You are still a fool, and you have explained nothing. What you have done is a copypasta work from other sites. You haven't actually described in your own words how the algorithms work.1. Learn to read first, before you start talking to me. I have never ever in any post said anything about any "cascade effect". 2. STOP MANIPULATING!. STOP making offtopic so it makes you look smarter than you actually are. You are weak, and you are using cheap tricks of the weak. This will not work with me.It is your job to provide valid logical arguments since you started this stupid discussion. You have failed to do so.Actually, i personally think about incorporating bcrypt() into my algo for greater performance, but i will be continuing this discussion just to prove how stupid, impudent and manipulative you are.  This has nothing to do with the current topic. I am not listening to you, until you explain what is the difference between bcrypt() and my func. Because i keep stating you have no fuckin idea what you are talking about. You are deliberately making offtopic to mask your total lack of knowledge, but this trick does not work with me.I dare you. Explain that to me. Still waiting.Also, about earlier post:Look how easy this is:Code:$hashedPassword = HashPassword::Make($password, 'LEVEL3 SALT', 2048); //Total of 6144 roundsThis will provide stronger hashing than bcrypt() with 12 rounds , as each round in bcrypt() is actually a power of 2 rounds (bcrypt(data, 12) gives you actually total 4096 small rounds if I am not mistaken) .This is just one bad idea, **which I admitted is not the best sollution** in the same topic. But still gives you higher level of security than no virtual machine at all (the attacker has to crack all the layers, which will take time. Also, he has to figure out that there is VM within VM, which he may accidentally not do).But what is important, this has completely nothing to do with the current discussion. @geneWhen you are done trolling and making a fool of yourself and you actually **understand** what bcrypt() does, then we can talk.For now, I find discussion with you a complete waste of time. OK.... so here you go.You have no arguments whatsoever and you are simply saying "hey, I am right because the guy in the article said so". You also have completely no idea how the bcrypt() itself works, as you cannot explain the differences between it and my algorithm in detail.I am sorry, but you are no cryptography specialist or even an experienced programmer. I find it a waste of time to continue discussing with trolls.EOT. Can you please stop talking "I'm smarter than you and I know better" bullshit and show me the difference between bcrypt() and my algo ?Because sorry - there isn't any according to PHP manual.----EDIT2:Investingating the matter further, actually it seems that my function far better than crypt(), as it uses different salt for each layer of hashing, where crypt() only uses single salt for all layers.----EDIT:OK, i have had enough of this.Only a fool uses the argument of power instead of power of arguments.So you either show me the logical evidence that you are correct, or I will officially view you as a fool. I dare you. Here ya go:Code:define('CNF_PASSWORD_SALT1', 'fvuiyt8635t394nng'); //Change this to some random stuffdefine('CNF_PASSWORD_SALT2', 'sdfkofuhnA%^%^23J'); //Change this to some random stuffdefine('CNF_PASSWORD_HASH0', 'sha512');define('CNF_PASSWORD_HASH1', 'whirlpool');define('CNF_PASSWORD_HASH2', 'sha512');//20 rounds by default. Change to more if more security is requireddefine('CNF_PASSWORD_EXTRA_ROUNDS', 20);class HashPassword { protected static $level0PassHash = null; protected static $level1PassHash = null; protected static $level2PassHash = null; protected static $defaultHashRounds = null; protected static function _init(){  self::$level0PassHash = CNF_PASSWORD_HASH0;  self::$level1PassHash = CNF_PASSWORD_HASH1;  self::$level2PassHash = CNF_PASSWORD_HASH2;  self::$defaultHashRounds = CNF_PASSWORD_EXTRA_ROUNDS; }  public static function Make($inputData, $extraSalt = false, $extraRounds = false) {  if (!isset(self::$level0PassHash)){   self::_init();  }  if ($extraRounds === false) {   $extraRounds = self::$defaultHashRounds;  }  if ($extraRounds > 0) {//More rounds through recursion   $halfStringPos = floor(strlen($inputData) / 2);   $inputData = substr($inputData, $halfStringPos) . substr($inputData, 0, $halfStringPos); //This shifts the string on each round -  '123456' into '456123' etc.   $inputData = self::Make($inputData, $extraSalt, $extraRounds - 1); // Recursion  }  $hashLevel0 = $extraSalt ?    hash(self::$level0PassHash, $extraSalt.$inputData.$extraSalt) :     hash(self::$level0PassHash, $inputData);    $hashLevel1 = hash(self::$level1PassHash, CNF_PASSWORD_SALT1.$inputData.CNF_PASSWORD_SALT1);  $output = hash(self::$level2PassHash, CNF_PASSWORD_SALT2.$hashLevel0.CNF_PASSWORD_SALT2);    return $output; }}3 layered hashing, different salt on each layer. Level 3 salting is optional.There are 3 smaller rounds in a single big round, so a total of 20 rounds (default) gives you 60 salted hashing rounds in total for a single password. Benchmark your scripts and change the number of rounds depending of the power of your servers. Too many rounds can clog up the server as users logging in massively will use a lot of CPU.20 big rounds should be enough for everyone for starters.Usage:Code:HashPassword::Make($data, [optional] $additionalLevel3Salt = null, [optional] $changeNumberOfRounds = 20);If you want some serious security, put (for example) user's registration date (or anything else generated randomly on registration) into the $additionalLevel3Salt parameter. It will make rainbow tables attack unfeasible.This is a production - grade code. It should work without any modifications.License:WTFPL License, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL---------------------EDIT:Also, there is a useful list of different hashing algorithms' speed on php.netPlus the lengths of hashes produced by each of the algos:Have fun. I can supply the hashing algorithm, as I have already written it.Give me half an hour, i need to start up the laptop and find it. I studied the topic a little more:Here is the description of the crypt() function from PHP manual, which was specified in the article "Use Bcrypt Fool":Then basically, what crypt() function does, is multiple salted rounds of hashing.So can somebody explain to me what is the difference between bcrypt and my algorithm ? Code:hash_algo1(salt1 + hash_algo2(salt2 + hash_algo3(salt3 + data))) * N recursive roundsBecause, seriously - I cannot find one.  I am not finished.I can also increase the entropy by using extra secret field from the database PLUS the user's registration date which is also needed to generate the final hash.So the entropy is not low (like in the examples shown here) anywhere within the hashing process. If no is the answer, then there is completely no advantage of using bcrypt versus multi hashes with multi salt as I have already written a recurrent function which does exactly the same as bcrypt().You simply use the_hash_function($data, salt1, salt2, salt3, rounds) and basically what it does is it recurrently repeats Code:hash_algo1(salt1 + hash_algo2(salt2 + hash_algo3(salt3 + data))) for X number of rounds, each time salting everything again.Once the hardware becomes more powerful, i can simply increase the number of rounds to Y. I have been a programmer for 14 years, and FYI, i have written from scratch strong cryptography algorithms myself.So please stop talking bullshit and let's have a real discussion other than "BCRYPT FTW, IF YOU DON'T THINK SO, STFU".Wait, just let me get something straight before i continue this discussion.If i generate a password hash using bcrypt with X rounds, and then i increase it to Y rounds, will both functions generate the same hash ?I mean is bcrypt(pwd, rounds = 10, salt) equal to bcrypt(pwd, rounds = 20, salt) ?Am I understanding this correctly ? Actually, you don't need to use bcrypt.You can have exactly the same effect using multiple layered hashing algorithms with specified number of rounds.You only need to increase the number of rounds once hardware gets more powerful - it will have exactly the same effect as bcrypt.Also, i trust multiple salted hashing algorithms more than a single algorithm (blowfish), which is used in bcrypt. Judging by secunia, PHPBB is also fully patched.http://secunia.com/advisories/product/17998/ Apparently.Moving to PHPBB or vBulletin is a solution to only one of your problems.Another one is that the forums are so heavily trolled & flooded with pointless/spam post that it has become difficult to actually discuss about something seriously here.This forum lacks a Slashdot-like moderation system. Slashdot has probably the best moderation system in the world. It automatically filters out all spam & scam messages with high effectivness. Also, it severely decreases the level of trolling. The safest place to put your coins is a specialized machine (preferably cheap netbook) with bitcoin client only and hard disk encryption installed. Disconnected from the internet by default.The machine should be put either in your home or somewhere safe. You should only use it when you want to send money out of it, or when you want to store wallet.dat backups on some storage media (of course, also encrypted with Truecrypt or something else). 1. I haven't investigated Bruce Wagner enough to have a 100% opinion, however after doing some reading i think there is at least 63% probability that he is a scammer. That is my, subjective opinion however.2. Check out yourself how the slashdot moderation system works. It really nicely mods out any spamming/scamming practices very quickly. I think it is the best on the net. Seriously, this forum needs to be upgraded.Also, it could use a Slashdot-like auto-moderation system, so all the buzz, trolls, spam & some scammers are automatically filtered out.It's too loud here to even discuss seriously about anything. A bunch of schoolkids, spammers, scammers & other screwed people are making this place miserable. It should be fixed long ago.I don't know about SMF, but surely there is some plugin like that avaiable for PHPBB. https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/final.jsCode:var cosbyText = $('<p>')  .html('Buy CosbyCoins! <i>(Pay with bitcoin!)</i>')  .css({    textAlign : 'center',    font : '18pt Arial',    color : '#f99',    position : 'absolute',    width : 700  });Can somebody please take care of this shit ? https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/final.jsCode:var cosbyText = $('<p>')  .html('Buy CosbyCoins! <i>(Pay with bitcoin!)</i>')  .css({    textAlign : 'center',    font : '18pt Arial',    color : '#f99',    position : 'absolute',    width : 700  });Can somebody please take care of this shit ?
Oh lol WTF. XSS on Bitcoin forums at a time such as this. Eh. Surely this will further strengthen the people's belief in Bitcoin economy.//Noscript activated. We are seeing massive level scams being made.We need more serious buisnesses to invest in Bitcoin, so that it can gain trust of normal people.A currency cannot gain wider audience if it is mostly used by all kinds of con-artists.Bitcoin is as powerful tool as it always was, nothing has changed in that matter. All the amazing properties are the same, and no new technical weaknesses has been discovered.What failed is the dark part of human nature. And that is what we need to improve. @Mt.FunI agree with most of your points.Despite some heavy criticism, fluctuations and scams, Bitcoin is definately staying.Why is that ? It's because it is an Open Source project. Open source projects never die, as long as there is at least one developer who wants to develop them. Some projects get revived even after years of code not being changed, but i highly doubt that will be the case with Bitcoins, as the development will never completely die. Until today, everybody treated Bitcoin as a get-quick-rich scheme and a way to scam other people. That was the initial level. Now, we are moving into the next level: slow stabilization. The 3rd level is, i hope, fast but stable growth.EDIT:Also, another argument:No technical weakness has been discovered to this day in BTC and it is still superior to any other currency known to mankind before. Nothing has changed really.What we are observing now is just negative parts of human nature exploiting the occasion. I am a bitcoiner and what is this ?DO WANT ! Well yeah... I guess everybody makes mistakes. It's not really "technical", its real.Bitcoins are physically not stored on anybody's computer.The private key giving you access to certain amounts of BTC should be viewed as a digital "certificate of ownership" of bitcoins, not bitcoins themselves - it's completely logical. Actually, no. And that is the beauty of it.The actual balance is stored by the whole network, not on your physical computer. So by "sending" bitcoins, you don't really change their physical localization. It's just matter of complex mathematical computations.By sending Bitcoins, you give somebody else the rights of ownership to the bitcoins, but they don't move themselves. I would say that Bitcoin is not a virtual currency, because it is more like virtual goods.After all, it has all the properties of gold, except it's not physical. So perhaps the law should simply treat it as a commodity. The general idea is very very good, but the current "snapshots" of the network should be put on torrent sites.Torrents offer many advantages over normal ways of distribution:- Automatic checking of authenticity (torrents have checksums integrated)- Greatest speed of download- Decentralization: no central servers needed (same as with Bitcoin)  I guess it will be similiar to http://www.dealextreme.com/ Yep, that is it.We should place Bitcoin in repos of distros like Gentoo, Arch, Ubuntu, or Debian Sid (unstable, "fresh" debian), which have newer versions of packets updated more frequently.But this policy won't work with enterprise-class distros like Stable debian, CentoOS/Redhat etc. This is only true for the first few months/years of the crisis.After that, when monetary economy begins to kick in again, Bitcoin will become one of the most valuable things out there.Of course only if internet will keep existing. Bitcoin doesn't exist without the internet. So if a war / or heavy crisis happens and communication networks get destroyed/disconnected, we need to reboot Internet first before Bitcoin can prevail. WTF is going on ?Is this some kind of coordinated attack, or just coincidence ? I find it hard to believe in coincidences.FYI, Bitomat.pl was the largest Polish exchange, and simultaneously 3rd in the world. There is nothing excellent in not being able to use a logo because of restrictive license...So my question stands. Are these logotypes public domain or Creative Commons ? Bump.Are these logos (especially skull88's ones) all in public domain, or otherwise ? If so, what is the license ? In case of some of you are using my little "No Forced TX Fee" branch, I have updated it to the latest version, merging back all the changes from the mainline client.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/FYI, since I don't copy/merge back tags from the original client, to get exact 0.3.24 code please use the "nftf-0.3.24" branch instead, avaiable here:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tree/nftf-0.3.24Trunk contains latest trunk source like in the original client, not 0.3.24. OK, MtGox finally contacted me and i regained access to my account.Closing topic. The fact is, i have been using 0.3.20 all the time now, and no coins were lost.So i think you are talking jibberish nevertheless.Nobody is saying anything about conspiracy.It is just a "common ground" of most prominent miners & developers. They all invested money in mining, so why would they act differently ?Too bad the side effect is normal users are completely unnecessarily ripped off (for small money but still).And what would be the reason for that ?Can't you just stop talking instead ? First thing i checked.
Sorry, but you have no idea what you are talking about. I find this discussion completely useless & unnecessary.EOT. How do you know it doesn't work ? Did you even try to compile it ?Sorry, still not convinced.----BTW.Project update.- I have merged back all of the current mainline client changes back into the fork.- Between others, Polish translation was added by somebody into the mainline client- Small code beauty & compatibility changes in the fork. This is all i get after trying to recover one of my accounts with 125 Bitcoins on it.I was trying this form for about 50 times already, and i STILL get no email at all (i have a GMAIL address).So my question is: WTF is going on here ?Anybody got similiar experiences ? Very difficult, but not impossible.BTW,Because of Gavin's aggressive responses to my pointing out of an obvious bug I am now more convinced than ever that this is a typical Mining Cartel Scam.Not nice. I am talking about thinking this whole case over, which is already done.And my conclusion is that experts settings should be added for people who want to risk their money. Easy. Add expert settings in config file.So called "stupid" users usually don't know what config file is and how to use it. Problem solved.Already done.Done.Done.Can't do. I can diff, merge, patch, fork, compile, package, change minor things, but I cannot develop things with medium to big complexity on my own as it would be irresponsible & dangerous with my minimal C++ skill.So I think I did all I could here. So I guess no mainline client developer is going to talk to me seriously about this.Somehow, I am not surprised. First, thank you for responding at last.I didn't realize that i will have to make a fork to get your attention.Of course i realize this is not the proper solution to the problem, this is only a temporary fix.As i said earlier in this topic, there should be additional dialog saying like "Are you sure you want to do this ? Your coins may get lost forever", which perhaps only shows up when "expert mode" is selected either in bitcoin config or in preferences somewhere in the GUI.The whole point is, forcing a fee on everybody is so very very, VERY not libertarian. I am a free man, and if i want to risk losing my money, then so be it. That is my choice.I hate when somebody imposes something on me. I want to be given a choice. Always. Isn't this the whole point of open source ? Didn't I say like 5 times in this topic that i didn't touch any relaying code, did I ?This is what I am talking about the entire thread (about the devs not letting me create transaction without a fee), were you actually listening ? You are talking about a "naughty boy" who cannot change the code himself.It will still be easy for all technical types/hackers/people with a lot of money to change the mainline client and send as many spam/dust transactions as they want.-----------I added a proper warning in the starting post of this topic.As of now, this fork is not suited for Bitcoin newbies. Unless i overlooked something in the code, CreateTransaction() is not used for relaying transactions, but for creating them (=sending money) is it ?So what is the problem exactly ?Not all of them are "super low".There is a topic on this forums with a guy which claims that he was forced to pay something around 20% fees for sending 50 BTC of money (I may remember the exact numbers wrong, but you get the idea).But that is of course talking about the old version having 0.01 fee, not 0.0005. To this day i was using 0.3.20 all the time and guess what: no coins were lost. The patch i created reverts the fee forcing behavior to 0.3.20 and that is all it does.Also, on http://bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin/ there is only one transaction that is due 20 days, but it contains coins from unconfirmed transactions. Really bad.So i guess this isn't so extremely dangerous after all, you just need to be a little more careful and only send stuff after you get 7 confirmations or more. Well, whatever are the details of all this, none of the devs seems to care even to talk to me about this.So i find this extremely suspicious.I wonder if some (or all) of them didn't invest heavy money in mining. After all, who would want to intentionally decrease their profits ?There are only two lines of code changed, and the change is very minor... So i **seriously** doubt anything could go wrong currently.No problem. I will keep everybody posted if i encounter any problems. +1, Excellent idea.The same could be done to all kind of cryptographic information in Bitcoin - transactions, public keys, private keys and so.This would make it possible to store your Bitcoin wallet entirely in Your brain ! More:----------You are correct, i will remove the LowTxFee branch.It wasn't my intention to COMPLETELY remove the need of fees.My intention was to restore default 0.3.20 behavior, which didn't force the fee on me when i tried to send transaction that the client doesn't like.----------Also:I realize my current fork isn't perfect, it only reverts creating transaction to default 0.3.20 behavior.This of course isn't the best way to do this.To do this properly, there should be additional dialog saying "Are you sure you want to send the bitcoins without a fee ? Without the transaction fee, it may never get confirmed", and only when the user selects "YES", the transaction should be sent.The way it is now in the mainline client, everybody is FORCED to pay a fee, and THAT IS JUST PLAIN WRONG.But as you can see, nobody cares to fix it, so here I am. Sure i agree it may be little risky, but what you are doing is complaining isntead of trying to help me here. Not very constructive.I bugged main developers many times that 0.3.21 is broken, and they didn't even comment on it - it's like they intentionally ignore the obviousness of the algorithm being flawed.So there is something seriously wrong here.Perhaps, instead of complaining, do something constructive and simply improve the code.I never said i completely don't know what I am doing. I programmed in many languages in my life and I should be able to make minor changes without doing harm. I understand the code to some point.If i tried to do something more complex then it would be irresponsible - I agree.  But that is not the case here.Actually, in the latest update i fixed the AllowFree() to be normal and only modified bool CreateTransaction(), so that dust spam relaying code becomes unchanged.Unless I am wrong, the only thing that is changed now is creating new transactions.Code:In CreateTransaction():Before:                bool fAllowFree = CTransaction::AllowFree(dPriority);                int64 nMinFee = wtxNew.GetMinFee(1, fAllowFree);After:                //Bitcoin NFTF Patch - changed by ShadowOfHarbringer START                int64 nMinFee = wtxNew.GetMinFee(1, true);                //Bitcoin NFTF Patch - changed by ShadowOfHarbringer END Yup. You have a point.But still, most miners accept my transactions even though the mainline client says he doesn't like it.I get many confirmations pretty quickly.So perhaps the intent could be sincere (but i highly doubt it), but still, the algorithm is broken. It should be more dynamic, not fixed like this. Bitcoin is very volatile so making algorithms which are based totally on fixed constants is not a good idea. OK, never mind. I fixed this myself in all branches.AllowFree() returns correct values now.----Ah, one more thing.Incorrect. I just looked at the code and it seems that it only protects against people who don't know programming well enough to change it themselves. And hackers & bad guys usually do, or simply pay somebody who knows.Basically by changing one line of code in the client, you can do whatever you want (and send whatever transactions you want).So i don't really understand what was the point of forcing everybody to pay the miners additional fees if it wasn't necessary.Mining cartel of whatever ? Yeah, i had the same idea that a while ago, but i was either unnoticed or ignored by main devs.Also, i cannot create a new dialog box myself, because I am not really a C/C++ programmer (and i don't have a proper C/C++ IDE installed at the moment) so i can only do minor changes & code merges at most.I programmed several languages in my life and I was thinking many times about learning C, but it always was too time consuming and i never had the time.But if you know how to implement this, you are welcome to do so yourself. This was default behavior in 0.3.20 and it worked fine for me.EDIT: Err i checked in the code and actually it wasn't but if you know how to do it better, you are welcome to try.0.3.21 and later versions has brought me only problems.I can't even send 10 BTC i received hour earlier, because dialog says it needs a fee.So i downgrade to 0.3.20 and poof ! Problem fixed. I can resend the money, and later i get 2-3 confirmations after about an hour.So this is why i said that the algorithm is broken.
I created the fork.Read here:http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=22434.msg281703#msg281703Binary Linux packages will be soon built, also I am currently looking for Windows & MacOS maintainers. Warning: Only use this fork if you know what you are doing. Otherwise, there is a low probability that some coins sent without a fee will be lost stuck in a limbo and difficult to recover.Read details below.-------------------2013-03-24 WARNING !!PLEASE NOTE THAT UNTIL MAX BLOCK SIZE PROBLEM HAS BEEN SOLVED BY DEVELOPERS, SOME FREE (WITHOUT FEE) TRANSACTIONS CREATED BY THIS FORK MAY CONFIRM VERY SLOWLY OR NEVER.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.-------------------Okay, here we go.So as I promised, I created the "NFTF" (short of No Forced TX Fee) section on Github.This isn't going to be anything big & professional, just few lines of code changed comparing to the standard client.I did it, because i was unsatisfied with standard client forcing people to pay fees, even when they are not necessary at all.I wrote many complaints about this on multiple topics on this forum, and for unknown reasons the main developers do not want either to remove this broken algorithm, or to improve it. Mining cartel ? CIA-related conspiracy ? Who knows & Who cares. I don't know and I don't care so I am going my own way.So here you are.Full list of branches & tags is avaiable here:Code:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tagshttps://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/branchesBranches contain code of older versions (from 0.3.21 to 0.3.24).Tags contain newer versions, 0.4.0 and up.---------------- Warning: Use this fork with following precautions (the same as if you would use mainline client v0.3.20 version):- Make sure you get at least 7 confirmations first when resending the money without a fee.- Sending small amounts (< 0.01) without any fee may be risky.- Include a fee when sending money received from a lot of inputs. ----------------2011-09-22 Update:Today I have merged back the commit from trunk which fixes an unfairly high fees that have to be paid to the miners sometimes due to a bug re-introduced in 0.3.24.For details see the discussion here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=45259.0The patch is/will be already present in 0.4x version of official client, but i have also merged it back into 0.3.21, 0.3.22, 0.3.23 and 0.3.24 versions - for people who like to use older and more tested apps.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/commits/nftf-0.3.21https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/commits/nftf-0.3.22https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/commits/nftf-0.3.23 (that version already contained the patch)https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/commits/nftf-0.3.24If you have used trunk version, it already contained the patch, merged back from official client.https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/Enjoy your no-unnecessary-fee transactions !As always, wait for at least 7 confirmations before re-sending money so you lower the risk of transaction not being accepted by the network.----------------2011-09-24 Update:NFTF - version 0.4.0 released.Also:- Removed all the messy git tags merged previously from the mailine client- Created new, clean tag for NFTF-0.4.0- Minor cosmetic changes in commentsSo from now on, code will be organized in tags, not versions - as it should be from the beginning.0.4.0 code is avaiable in the tag:https://github.com/ShadowOfHarbringer/bitcoin-nftf/tree/nftf-v0.4.0/And trunk code is avaiable from the trunk, as always.

Actually, If something can be called a mark of the beast, then it is the crappy fiat currencies with their bank-controlled, crysis-causing & credit-powered baloon economy.Today's monetary system is completely sick. It does not support wise investments, but only mindless spending.Bitcoin is the cure. Actually, i had the forced feee even when sending 10 BTC having 7 confirmations....So i guess this wasn't fixed. OK....I shall be setting the fork on Github this weekend.I will post details here (and in a new topic) once i create the fork. For now, stick to the 0.3.20 version.http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/Unfortunately compiling for windows is not as easy as it is with linux.Also, i don't have any windows installed at the moment.I hope we find some maintainers for other operating systems. You should be able to select an older version via Github.Of course, that's source-only.Also, there are 0.3.20 (and older) binaries on SourceForge.http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/The problem with fork is i can only compile it for Linux, somebody else has to compile Windows version.EDIT:Completely forgot about MacOS.I am not doing MacOS as well. +1I am starting to think seriously about maintaining a "No-Forced-TX-Fee" fork of the main client. Polite bump.Let's ask this question differently: Was the algorithm which decides what is spam and what isn't changed at all since 0.3.21 ? Was the spam-detection algorithm improved since 0.3.21 ?In 0.3.21, even when i wanted to send some bitcoins having 7 confirmations, i had to pay the fee. Downgrade to 0.3.20 fixed the problem, and i could send the bitcoins (and later i got 2 confirmations after 45 minutes, so the transaction was OK contrary to what client claimed).So is this finally fixed or not ? You mean 1 BTC or 10 BTC ?I don't understand how this could possibly work.Is this a troll topic or am I misunderstanding something ? +1Everything that i wanted to say was already said here.muad_dib, you have no idea what you are talking about. There isn't any 100% proof that BSD is either more secure or more reliable than Linux. @muad_dibAt first your post seemed wise, butI stopped reading right here.I don't know who you are, but you know nothing about security. Definately worth of inclusion.+1 You are not listening.He is only talking about the linux package, not windows/macos. Agreed. This feature seems definately cool. Bump for inclusion. Actually, i meant VNCing to the VM from a laptop.VNCing from the same comp would have no sense as the keyloggers/screen capture/mouse movements capture would kill it.But VNCing to the bottom layer from outside should be safe enough.Well, i didn't say this is the most secure way, i just said it is more secure than having single layer protection on a single computer.The "separate minimal machine for Bitcoin only" is of course superior to everything. Actually, it does.You may fool an attacker into thinking that he hacked all the layers, while he only hacked top 2 of them.Security by obscurity + surprise element.Who needs mouse movements when you can connect to a (virtual) machine using  encrypted VNC connection ?The possibilities are endless. VM is just the beginning of the things you can do.Not all of the exploits work on all kinds of VM's.Also, a possible attacker may not be prepared for task of this level of complexity.This is certainly the best way, but having a hall of mirrors is also useful when you are only using single machine.As I said, "the possibilities are endless. VM is just the beginning of things you can do".Generally my thinking is that you can create multiple levels of complexity and every one of the makes it more difficult for the attacker to hack you. Of course it is, because you said so.How can we ever doubt you, you are such a SMART-ASS !Yes, and become easy prey to hackers of all sorts. I am saying about a following scheme:1. Create encrypted TrueCrypt hard drive.2. Put a VirtualBox disk with VirtualBox Linux machine on it.3. Install TrueCrypt within the Virtual Machine4. Create encrypted TrueCrypt hard drive within the VM.================== (LAYER 2) ================== 5. Create a VirtualBox disk with VirtualBox Linux machine on the VM.6. Install TrueCrypt within the Virtual Machine in Virtual Machine7. Create encrypted TrueCrypt hard drive within the VM in VM.================== (LAYER 3) ================== (...)================== (LAYER 4) ================== (...)And so on...
First, I personally would never run "Bitcoin safe" with 25k Bitcoins on a Windows computer.Too big a security risk. Second, even on Linux, to keep large amount of coins on your computer, it should be extra protected with some complex security.A virtual machine with Linux on truecrypt-encrypted hard drive with Bitcoin installed should be enough - it will make life much harder for any keyloggers & hackers to infiltrate it.With computers it is quite easy to do virtually infinately complex system of safes to store your Bitcoins.You can create a virtual "room of mirrors" using VM in Truecrypt in VM in VM in Truecrypt in VM in Truecrypt and such.Such an installation could look like this:Truecrypt(VirtualBox(VirtualBox(Truecrypt(VirtualBox(Truecrypt(Your Bitcoins))))))You can store some Bitcoins on every layer of this onion, but you should only store large sums on the last layer. But why would i want my toaster to have an external IP address ?This is just potential another unnecessary security risk. I want all devices in my network (except servers) to be completely invisible from outside. I do not want _ANY_ interaction between the outside world and these devices. Security concerns.Therefore i find "ip-for-your-toaster" idea foolish. You are completely forgetting about mining pools.Anybody can pay for few months hosting and start a mining pool... There can be very many pools and people can switch from pool to pool if they find a pool is unfair and/or damaging the network.This should fix the centralization problem. You are probably correct, however in many cases still like the NAT-way better than single IP for everything.There are some small specialized devices that simply don't neet their own external IP address.Also, there is the security-by-obscurity concern. Nobody needs to know how many devices exactly is in my network. I don't think that IPv6 will invalidate NAT and therefore UPNP.There are many people who like to have a closed network behind a NATed firewall. I belong to these people.I know a little about network security, and nobody can tell me that giving IPv6 address to every machine in the house is safe. Because it isn't.The NAT-way, where all machines in a subnetwork are protected by additional firewall, is simply better. It would be much better idea to simply allow multiple hashing algorithms to be used in block chain so whole network can make a switch over night.This would make it even more fun. I suppose nobody asked this questions yet:1. Why isn't the site listed on Bitcoin wiki's Trade section ? https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade2. Does the owner have any representative on this forum ? (i especially mean a representative with some reputation)Sorry, it just doesn't look like a service i would trust. I believe you can downgrade to 0.3.20 without any loss.However, do a backup first. Always do a lot of backups. Actually, as chain "checkpoints" are hardcoded into the default Bitcoin client, even with the processing power it is practically impossible to pull something like this off. This thread deserves bumping for great justice.Especially now, that Bitcoin network is growing exponentially.* ShadowOfHarbringer likes this.+1 I think it will be the best just to ignore him.He is either trolling us, he is some kid, or his fucked up & overgrown ego won't allow him to ever to listen to anybody but himself.This thread is a total waste of time. If you would understand the specification, you would know that this is impossible.Even if CIA accumulates 90% of network's processing power, transactions will still confirm. Much slower yes, but they will...Playing "smartass" without understanding anything is the domain of the mindless.So it is clear who is mindless here.I have no more time to continue this idiotic & fruitless discussion, I'm outta here. You talk much, but you really understand nothing about the protocol.We have a saying in my country, which roughly translates to "A cow which makes a lot of noise, gives little milk". And that is the problem in your case.BTW, I support the idea of creating newbie forum subsection for such foolish discussions. I wonder how much longer i will be able to stand this keynesian bullshit...FYI, Bitcoins CAN be created in any moment at will using division into smaller pieces (just like gold). Just add more decimal places and you have enough for everybody. OMG, this thread is still going...I'm starting to think this is a deliberate action to weaken the faith of some people (read: n00bz) in Bitcoin.Since CIA already admitted its interest in Bitcoin, this is a likely scenario.Of course, it is not going to be successful. Market verifies everything. People can discuss all the time and even write essays, but the market will verify their claims. I join this.I think it is very important and quite interesting that we experiment to find the best workin currency model (or perhaps find some ways to improve current model).Maybe it would be beneficial for BTC users for 2, 3 or more separate systems to exist simultaneously.Although this should be done through a fork, not forcing changes on the current chain. The market will decide the rest. If there really is a demand for "StuffCoin", "Inflatacoin", "SuperDeflataCoin" etc, then market will preserve them and they will live their own lives.So Suggester: please go start your own chain. Seriously. (Added to watchlist) Does github have bugzilla-like system of its own ?Because we really need that too. That is an obvious bug, i have written about it in multiple places. http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=10702.msg153527#msg153527http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=10419.msg150844#msg150844http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=8153.msg150444#msg150444Just use 0.3.20 like me and it will be fine.I guess i am lucky too, because all low-prior transactions also send quickly for me (by "quickly" i mean under 2 hours). Omg...I stopped reading after this.
OMG Bitcoin will die - we are all doomed !!So perhaps everybody who wants to escape certain doom, should sell me his bitcoins for $3 each. Do it now, before its too late ! +1I don't particularly believe that this would be successful, but i will surely watch the development with interest.Perhaps even many forks should be created - inflata-coin, superdeflata-coin, stuff-coin, alter-coin - so we can experiment & test which one will be more successful than others.  Totally agreed.When the total economy size will break 1.000.000.000 (1 billion dollars), then it's going to get interesting.For now, modest 76 mil USD will have to suffice  Because this poll is no longer valid as we already broke 10 USD, let's move on to the next one - 50x parity !http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=11339.0 OK, so we broke 10 USD barrier !The old poll is no longer valid, let's move on.It's time to vote for the next one. I don't think the problem is really solved... 0.3.21 calculates the (EDIT: necessity of) fees wrongly. I had the same problem (popup saying i need a fee when trying to send ~10 BTC received within last hour ), i downgraded to 0.3.20 and it let me send immediately. After that, i got 3 confirmations after about 45 minutes. So fee was not really neded at all.Sorry guys, but the new "newbie friendly" fee algorithm is totally crap to say the least. Still, that is my choice to make. Of what i read, it seems that you can't.More than one 5970 do not work on single mainboard. It was tested on multiple mainboards & power supplies (it is not power supply problem) by somebody on this forum.Yeah, its subject to change in the future. Well, who cares ?5870's are the most cost-effective anyway.Also you can put four 5870s in a single motherboard and they will work. 5970's don't work this way, i don't know about 6990. Still, that won't work in the GUI, which is annoying. That's what I am talking about.I had to downgrade to 0.3.20 to get around this. BTW.The fact that the transaction fee is forced annoys me. I am still using 0.3.20 because of that fact.Wouldn't it be wiser to leave the final decision to the user and allow sending a transaction without fees after one more "Are you sure ?" dialog option (or "force" rpc/cmdline command) ?If i want to wait for 10 hours for the 1st confirmation, why not let me ?Not leaving the choice to the user is so not libertarian. Exactly. This automatically turns on the red light for me. This is also the reason why i don't use 0.3.21 yet - because i don't like others to decide for me what i want to do with my money.I think that the fees should be automatically estimated based on by some king weighed average of transaction size OR on the current BTC prices comparing to other currencies.In either case, the decision if the fee should be paid or not, should be left to the users and miners, which make the market. If i want to send small amount without a fee and wait 10 hours for confirmation, then let me - that is my right because I am a free man - and Bitcoin is money of the free people.Perhaps the default client should have a "--force" parameter just like many GNU command line applications, which sends transaction even if it is probably not optimal.----EDIT:Also see my other post here:http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=6189.msg127007#msg127007 Isn't it possible to introduce some automatic downloading & adjustment of current fees depending on BTC prices comparing to other currencies from bitcoinwatch, bitcoincharts or something ?Of course, if none of the servers respond quickly, then the default fee will be taken.I know this is not the best solution, but surely it has to be better than fixed fee. Sounds like fun.Can you disclose how many ninjas will be present on the conference (at least approximately) ? I recall the previous ninja conference was held just before the ninja parade:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtR2m20C2YM  +1 I join the question. Hmmm...Too bad that this doesn't show up when i do # bitcoin --help.Otherwise i wouldn't start this topic.Weird. I'm using the pre-built bitcoin binary version 0.3.20. Is it built with UPnP support then ?If not, then how disabling UPnP could have fixed it ?Why should disabling UPnP make the client reject connections ? This is weird. Shouldn't this be considered a bug ?I have forwarded the ports manually... I said i have DMZ set up.Also, UPnP is disabled on my router anyway (i consider it to be unnecessary security risk), so enabling or disabling UPnP should have no effect whatsoever. But I do want it to listen.Without listening it is hard/slow for the client to make many external connections. With listening it is instant.But the actual problem is broken UPnP support, so the matter is clear now. The older versions weren't affected because there was no UPnP at all in them. UPnP is offline on my router, i have DMZ set up though to the comp with Bitcoin currently.But why should UPnP affect number of connections with external hosts ?----I am trying running bitcoin with "-noupnp" now, i will give you update in few minutes.----EDIT:Yup, you were right -noupnp seems to have fixed it.So this should be more like [BUG REPORT] than [FEATURE REQUEST].
Apparently not anymore.It goes up and up and up - it reached to 117 connections untill i killed it because it filled my bandwidth pipe.Tested on multiple computers on Linux.Also, It does so even after all blocks are downloaded. Hello,I'm having theoretically unimportant but practically problematic small problem with the main bitcoin client: it produces too many connections to external clients and clogs up my bandwidth.On my 2Mbit broadband home connection, after the client passes 100 connections, most of webpages becomes unreachable. Yeah, i know it is a weak broadband because it becomes clogged easily, but still. (For bittorrent it usually takes about 150 connections to fill the pipe up)I would like to propose adding "-max-connections=X" command line argument and/or "max-connections=X" directive to bitcoin.conf.----EDIT: It seems that actually it is UPnP support in the client that causes this. So this is more of a [BUG REPORT] than ft. request . I think that this discussion is not very relevant, because general public will decide which option is the best anyway because of Network Effects.After one option is selected by the most of people, there will be no stopping it. Perhaps the theory is correct, but the practice confirms you are wrong.The 9.95 was sent by me about 1 hour after receiving it using 0.3.20 version and later I got 3 confirmations after about 45 minutes.Perhaps the criteria for requiring transaction fees are wrong ? Yes, i am absolutely certain we got 3 confirmations and i think that 45 minutes is quickly enough, isn't it ? So why require a fee ? This is the receiving address I am talking about:http://blockexplorer.com/address/1LBK2EespTDpcxnR1J4utP9tBtbA6X5SF9As you can see, i received 9.95 bitcoins on it, and then i was unable to push the bitcoins further even though i had 7 confirmations. Gavin, i don't doubt your good intentions when requiring 0.01 fee, but this produces serious issues currently in my Bitcoin trading.Meaningly, when i tried to transfer about 9 bitcoins again after receiving 7 confirmations, i still got the "0.01 fee required because of blah blah" message. When i downgrade to 0.3.20, it does not produce this error.So what is the point of this feature if somebody can "fix it" just by downgrading to a slightly lower version ? Oel ngati kameie, ma oeyä tsmukan Can't we just have a color selection GUI like this installed here ?That should cover all possible colors. Banning Bitcoin by governments would only make it more popular.The real question is: will the governments dare to shut down the whole internet ? Because it is already too late for any other action that could have major effect on Bitcoin economy.No, seriously. Oh. Right. I think will just leave this here: I am confused.When i go to http://btcex.com, it says that the site is closed. But the courses still dynamically change on here: http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/Can somebody explain WTF is going on ?  And where is the option for the transparent race ?This is soooooooooo discriminative !! +1 to mBTCLet's not complicate things too much... Well, we all could just agree that when it comes to BTC, 'nano' means 10 ^ -8, instead of the usual 10 ^ -9. But that may be a bad idea. Dude.No source = nobody is going to trust you. You have no reputation here. Further discussion is pointless.We had enough scammers on this forum already. A lot of money got stolen... So i understand the server/daemon version allows the usage of all decimal places ? Yes, absolutely. The damn decimal point should be moved long ago. Haha i called him a fraud before and people told me that btcex.com is "not strictly fraud".Oh the irony. Of course, but they also want to hear it first hand, form the main developer. It is a complletely different thing to read some technical documentation and hear it in person from somebody who is project leader.You are probably right, however the most prominent CIA guys probably are living in the times before internet & rapid FOSS development, so they don't realize that Open Source projects cannot be controlled even if you buy out a project's boss. That's the beauty of it.Sure they will most likely try convincing Gavin to come to the "dark side", but sooner or later they will realize that this gives them nothing, and they will drop the idea.Sending info is NOT the same as coming to headquarters oneself.Face-to-face communication is simply waaaaaaaaay more effective than any other means.
Also, they could start fighting for their personal freedoms and abolish governments...Did that fairytale have dragons in it ?Seriously, not gonna happen. Stupid people will mostly stay stupid. I did come up with something like this.Code:1 BTC1 = 0.1 BTC1 BTC2 = 0.01 BTC1 BTC3 = 0.001 BTC1 BTC4 = 0.0001 BTCOR perhaps:Code:1 BTCA = 0.1 BTC1 BTCB = 0.01 BTC1 BTCC = 0.001 BTC1 BTCD = 0.0001 BTCetc.People also proposed the µBTC and mBTC, but for some reason i think these won't work. Perhaps because "normal" (non-geeky) people don't really know names of all SI units. My translation was reviewed & corrected many times by polish wikipedia moderators themselves, just see the edit history:http://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bitcoin&action=history Agreed, however...How do you do withdrawals on a closed site anyway ? I never said they will, i just said they can.But I personally doubt it. If they invited Gavin the way they did, they will rather not try an open attack.After all Bitcoin is a perfect tool for easy transfering the funds CIA earns from illegal drugs. Also, they can use it to anonymously fund all of their dark operations without leaving a trace. So i think they are going to use it for their gains. Yeah, they will definately try something.Even if Gavin won't accept money or power, they can still threaten to hurt his family or something.But anyway, the source is still free/open so i don't see many ways in which they could hurt Bitcoin. Open source projects are not governed by the laws that the rest of this civilization is governed by. Open source is like an idea. It is virtually impossible to destroy (as long as there is at least one living person developing). As i have said many times: Market will decide which solution is better.If somebody wants moar inflation so much, they should start their own currency and compete with Bitcoin. The code is free & open - so just do it.I somebody wants to add more inflation into bitcoin then they essentially want to steal from me. I will not tolerate such a common thievery, so i will always be against adding **ANY** more inflation than satoshi envisioned. EVER. Actually you are thinking backwards.Gavin would be a traitor if he went to CIA, took $3000 and didn't tell us (or told us after the fact).It's exactly the opposite - because Gavin told us openly that he is going to CIA (and he openly distributes the Video from the conference later) he is **honest** with us.Liars, thieves & traitors simply don't act openly this way.----EDIT:Also, this is a great opportunity to find out what do they want from us. Are they hostile or not ? Know your potential enemy. I noticed a small thing about your code immediately.Official PHP coding guidelines say to remove all ending tags ?> from php files. This fixes a number of possible errors with output buffering/compression caused by white spaces.Otherwise, great code. Of course you all realize that this topic is most likely definately read by CIA when writing all these anti-governments posts ?I hope they realize they can use Bitcoin for their gains (the currency doesn't care who owns/uses it) and won't try to fight us right away. It seems that everybody forgot about my Polish translation...http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin1NLWBAD7ZD82fJDDawKfp5RAKSR8YWWYd3 Botnet-powered bitcoin mining starts in 3..2..1... So wait, are you telling me that the 0,65% is so much for him that he actually needed to DDoS you... ?Or was it about the BTC/USD rate ?In soviet russia.... money taxes you it seems. Any data can be lost.I have 5-year experience with Truecrypt drives and they are not suspectible to data loss much more than any other/normal hard drive.Unless, of course, you forget the password.But there are ways to easily memorize a long password. What was the actual reason for btcex & other russians DDoSing you ?  Does he claim that you speculate/manipulate market or what ? +1 Yet another encouragement to use Truecrypt. Exactly.Isn't 43,8% a "modest" amount of inflation already ?Bitcoin will have inflation for the next 100 years, its just that demand for it rises much faster than inflation. Exactly.I try to be honest myself, so I am not doing business with straightly unethical characters. Hmmm....Close enough for me. Fraud it is.
Doesn't matter.He encouraged people/hackers to attack a rival exchange. That is enough. This is far from honest business. It is for me.I do not view a site of which owner coordinates DDoSes as a honest business. Therefore it is fraud. As far as i care. This is insanity what you just did.You have made yourself look childish, unprofessional & simply immoral.Also, you completely & totally undermined reputation of your exchange ! I will never trade anything on btcex.com after this has happened...  And i will tell all of my friends to never use it.As of now, I view btcex.com as a FRAUD site.----Also, WTF ? :Where is the REASON for closure ? OMG, WTF seriously... @Topic authorThis has been discussed many times over and over and over and over again.This will simply not happen. If it would, I (and probably most of the people who have Bitcoin now) would simply not use Bitcoin.Deflation is the most important reason why I am using Bitcoin - because i don't want governments or anybody else to steal from me.Go make a fork, start your own version of Bitcoin and stop littering the forums uselessly. I wonder why Btcex admin is not here yet to clear things up ? Do they really ?Well, even if it is so, threatening is far from actually hurting people. Logical inconsitency.Dollars are used both for trading drugs all around the world and by conservative imams in Saudi Arabia (and most other islamic countries since oil can only be bought for dollars)...All currencies can be used for both good and bad things. Using currency for "bad" things doesn't mean that the currency itself is bad. He is safe.If something would happen to Gavin at that meeting, this would be interpreted by everyone here as government attacking Bitcoin.If they are planning an attack on Bitcoin (but i doubt that is their intention at the moment), they would not want to alert the enemy first.The CIA/FBI/Gov guys are not stupid. Surely they will want to explore other possibilities than attack first. For example:a) Exploiting bitcoin for power, using it against other nations, increasing national advantage (perhaps using it to destabilize/manipulate/influence other countries).b) Actually making a profit on Bitcoin, which can be possibly used to fund Military/Intelligence.If none of the above options works, they may try an attack.Just remember that not everything that comes from military/intelligence is always bad. it was military & intelligence that produced the Internet & started the TOR project. That is expected.This whole monetary system runs on debt. No wonder why the bankers want you (and everybody else) to stay so badly.If everybody paid their debts instantly, there would be no money in the circulation, and the system would immediately collapse. ??Explain. Hahahahaha  Absolutely right.I think they are curious how/if they can use bitcoins to their advantage and against other nations.IMHO if/after they figure out they cannot use BTC for their gains, they will attack it.The question is if they can.If CIA has thrown their computer clusters' power into generating Bitcoin, they could become one of early adopters, which could  theoretically give them advantage agains other nations. Can that be the cause for their sudden interest in BTC ? If you were on their payroll, surely you wouldn't write everything openly like this with all the details.I believe you. +1And also -1 to any unnecessary bloat which would put more strain on the network. Cool.I was just thinking that such an imporant infomation should be included in the project site, so this is why I am asking. What is the license ?GPL ? BSD ? Mit ? Apache ? http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/04/05/2243209/Bashing-MS-Like-Kicking-a-Puppy-Says-Jim-Zemlinhttp://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/040511-linux-vs-microsoft.html?hpg1=bnWe won !Let's now make a new goal: Making entire human civilization be run by geeks, and make the official currency Bitcoin !Open Source won with Microsoft, so it is clear that Bitcoin can defeat FED & fiat money system The next era of human civilization will be a geek era !!  OMG, this has been discussed soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many times.It is absolutely impossible to "buy all the coins". Nobody can force anybody to sell even at the HIGHEST price.The human greed factor comes into play here. Right now, If somebody announced "hey, we're buying BTC for 100 dollars each !!", there would be a lot of people who would still hoard the BTC because they would think that the price will rise even more. Great ! Can't wait until that happens. I will be able to buy 100k of bitcoins for almost nothing ! Can you imagine that ?
Can we please lock/close & unpin the original bounty topic so no bloody necromancer can revive it anymore ? Well. Certain things just have to happen, whether we like it or not.The economy as of now is one big lie and manipulation, it has to and it will collapse ultimately.Of course, you can warn your friends.... but since they are hopelessly dependant on the system, it is extremely hard to separate them from it (if possible at all).Don't blame yourself needlessly, you have probably done everything you could without being seen as an insane person / conspiracy theorist / whatever. @SiriusCheck out your PMs. For web-based server side software, you might consider AGPL as a better license.It should protect you better from people who take and don't give anything back. +1Currency should stay a currency. When we involve in political stuff, we risk being associated with one of the sides.Currencies should be neutral by design. Ok, my mistake.Unfortunately, I do not posess this information. Ok.... so Gavin asked me (many times before and now) for the proof that the banking/financial industry avoids floats.And i have found it !!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Minimizing_the_effect_of_accuracy_problemsThe [7] reference leads here:http://speleotrove.com/decimal/--------------I think we can call the topic closed.Let's go string baby ! We can use different names for parameters, like SendCoinsString 100.00000000Instead ofSendCoins 100.00000000That would eleminate such problems forever.If you want to operate on string, just add suffix "String" to every parameter/attribute name. Well, OK. You've got a point.Still, no big deal.After everybody starts using strings instead of floats (and they will, because floats are seen as VERY unprofessional in the industry), we may remove the old float mode completely.However no hurry there, it may wait a few years. Is adding a "string mode" creating a second API ? I don't think so. This is just a switch, how can you call this a second api ? Also, an option for selecting the format of output data through XMLRPC/Command line/Whatever already exists in many modern applications.  Can't we just have 2 separate APIs - one float and one string in the official client ? Or maybe perhaps one API with "string mode" and "float mode" ?BTW, are the floats really so necessary and important that you defend them ? No offense, but while reading this topic it seems that almost nobody here likes floats except you. ...but probably sometimes for some reason they won't be turned on... The best price/power card will be probably 6970, because it has almost exactly the same power while being at least 40% cheaper (last time i checked).However that does not necessarily apply to the best Watt to Mh/s ratio. Paladium, Titanium, Molybdenum, Plutonium, Uranium, etc YES, definately yes.Give him all the money. I actually believe he deserves the money. I just pointed out that the poll was bad.I think we should give him all the money even if little less than 50% of people says so. Too bad that the poll is worhless (no offense) because of lack of security.Anybody can register 100 accounts and vote as many times as he wants.Perhaps the voting should be done in topic, and only votes from people having at least 10 posts, and registered for at least month ago should have a vote.After a week, the votes will be counted simply by reading the separate posts in the topic. Too bad that the poll is worhless (no offense) because of lack of security.Anybody can register 100 accounts and vote as many times as he want.Perhaps the voting should be done in topic, and only votes from people having at least 10 posts, and registered for at least month ago should have a vote. I don't know what your goal is, but whatever you want to do, do it separately from the current network.If your actions will start supplying invalid blocks to the current network, then that may be seen as an attack on Bitcoin by some people (me included).BTW,I don't recall any situation in history where increasing inflation would solve any problem, especially currency stability.So i still don't understand what are your motives in this. You can't make people hoard or not hoard BTC. It is not your call.Hoarding does happen and it will happen. Some people may hoard for very long time, and you cannot do anything about it really.I like the market the way it is now. Sure, there will be ups and downs, but more inflation will not fix anything. If you create new "Inflacoin" and start from scratch, the effects will be exactly the same. The early adopters will start their rigs first, acquiring 70% of the currency before it becomes popular enough so that other miners will want to risk joining.So what you are proposing does not fix Bitcoin childhood problems at all.  And at the moment we are experiencing childhood of the currency, so instability is expected. You cannot fix instability with more inflation !
So is the bounty paid already ? Well, the Bible says something about 10% being fair tax.I guess God (obviously) knows the Laffer curve, and also knows the less taxes, the better life becomes. Not only that.You also need to switch to another network, like testnet.Changing the code you wrote now and running modified client in normal Bitcoin network, should be treated as an actual attack on the network.Inflationists: Go fork and create your own network. It is just few lines of code. Changing BTC to inflationary model will not fix this.BTC with constant block reward will be also very deflationary in practice, and the situations you described can happen as well."Inflacoin" would be suspectible to the "early adopter" problem in the same way as BTC is, because that always happens with a rising currency - there are few people who invest in the currency first and they get the most out of it later - you can't avoid that.And i still think that you have some hidden motive in supporting this.  1. There is completely no problem in creating a fork. If you are on this forum, you should be a believer in free market rules. So I am saying free market is the thing that will decide who is right in the quickest, most obvious way.Also, it will only fragment the community for a short time, but after that, when all doubts will be resolved, Bitcoin will be stronger than ever."Things that don't kill you, make you stronger".2. The discussion is simply not an effective way to decide who is right. The free market decides who is right. Well, even if you are right, it's only safe for the seller.It is nowhere near safe for the buyer.The problem is, you never know if you aren't buying from a FBI/CIA agent.GPS geocaching would be a nice way to at least partially fix this inconvenience. LOL, there exists no incentive given that EVEN NOW people are paying fees even if THEY DON'T HAVE TO ? I call bullshit.I think that you are saying this only because you have certain interest in saying so.Bitcoin was created exactly because of there is practical inflation in all normal (fiat) currencies, and now you are telling me that we should bring back the same shit we just escaped from  ?Sorry, I don't think this is going to happen.I also think the poll results clearly show what is the public opinion on this.Please just take this inflationary bullshit with you and make a damn fork - we shall see what people choose. I will surely choose a currency that promises that tomorrow's bread will be always cheaper than today's bread. I don't see a point in my money being taxed.----This discussion itself is bullshit. Just create the damn fork and let the market decide. That is better option than making a poll. Well, I do have portable ceremonial shrines... 99,99 BTC if you are interested too.But this is a special offer that is valid only today ! silkroad:I think you should take a look at the drug-related discussion in the other thread:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175.msg71515#msg71515 There is a saying among programmers."If it works, don't change anything. Chances are you may break something".Seriously, what every currency needs is stability.I would say that following the rules set by somebody way smarter than you (satoshi) is very reasonable, and leads to the most stable situation for the currency.So unless another genius comes along, i don't see any point of changing something that works nicely. Shortly, I will follow the one who I know is smarter than me, not some random guy i spotted on a forum.Current deflation rate is the best because Satoshi said so. That is good enough for me. Die already, scammer.//BTW, i think this guy is retarded. That kind of currency (50 BTC block reward forever) would also be very deflationary in practice while inflationary by design, exactly as Bitcoin.That is because the number of goods & services offered for it would rise faster than the number of coins minted (assuming it became popular).So it would be very similiar to Bitcoin, but simply worse (because of weaker practical deflation) and IMHO people would quickly abolish it.Pointless. Strong No. 1. I don't know about that, I'm not using FB. But even on FB, people can link to Wikipedia.2. Well, even if that's true, they still have the search bar in their browser.I guess they know how to use it.3. Also, they usually know youtube. FB + Google + Youtube should be more than enough in this case. Thx a lot. Oh, that trick stopped working on Internauts some time ago.Yeah, it may work for some time on normal citizens, but Internet users are much better versed in the terms of internet technologies.Because of the fact of Bitcoin being a P2P technology, the public will associate it with Bittorrent, not terrorism (unless governments claim that using BT is terrorism too, but that won't work either).Yeah, i know what you are thinking. "The public" is stupid. Perhaps, most americans are stupid, but the ones already using Bittorrent, Wikipedia and Youtube (which is quite large percent i think) will very quickly undertstand what is going on and the government is lying. I mean it's 10 seconds on Google to find out what exactly Bitcoin is and what it is not, for God's sake.So no, i don't think that calling Bitcoin users "terrorists" or Bitcoin itself "tool used to spread terror" will work in the information era. That is a relative term.The inflation in Bitcoin is predefined and "controlled" by mathematical algorithm that is known to all parties in advance.So it is "controlled" in a way.Bitcoin is inflationary, and it will stay so until the last coin is mined (for another 100 years or so). Of course, the inflation decreases over time. +1 Bitcoin _is_ a system with controlled inflation.And it will keep being so for about next 100 years.So you are asking the wrong question.I think that the question you want to ask is "Would you support moving to a fiat-like electronic decentralized currency system".EDIT:The question for you is:What or who will "control" the inflation in your idea ? For which version will the patch be scheduled for ? Absolutely.The only viable option is GPS geocaching. Everything else is easily traceable.Using normal mail, there is 99,9% probabilty you will be caught sooner or later.Actually, anything physical (leaving physical traces) or involving third person is easily traceable, because you only need to find weak link in the chain to find the seller. People are usually the weakest links.I hope silkroad realizes this, because if he doesn't switch to GPS geocaching-only, sooner or later he will be caught.
Told ya. That is because the video is too damn fast. It will be impossible to create good subtitles, or voice record in some languages because of that.It should be slowed down at least 15% to make various translations possible.EDIT:Or perhaps you could release the background music and voice separately, so people can make modifications necessary for other languages  I don't wanna spoil all the fun guys, but this belongs in mining. What a load of crap.I didn't even bother reading after the "spyware" thing, LOL. There is no "manipulation".The rise of Bitcoin value is caused by 2 things:1. Slashdot effect, http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4827.msg70553#msg705532. Weusecoins.com / http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo&feature=player_embeddedEvery time the total amount of goods & services rise faster than number of avaiable coins, the Bitcoin will rally. Every time the opposite happens, it's value will fall. It is as simple as that.Therefore, every bigger influx of people into the system will rise the value of Bitcoins, which is what is happening when we are slashdotted / redditted / digged. I think yeah, that is if tsunami didn't kill him... (I mean it would be really nice if he signed in just to show that he is alive) We hit slashdot again today, prepare for the worst  (best) :http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/03/23/0210207/Google-Engineer-Releases-Open-Source-Bitcoin-ClientIt also contains link to a nice interview with Gavin Andresen:http://www.cio.com.au/article/380394/open_source_identity_bitcoin_technical_lead_gavin_andresen/I guess another rally is ahead of us (looking at MtGox's charts - I would say it already started). I meant people in other countries (not speaking english).If you make subs in another language, they will be unreadable. The first thing a viewer notices when watching this video is "damn, this is fast". And that is the point. It's taking the focus away from Bitcoin itself and moving it to the velocity of the video.When i first watched it, that was my first impression. So do you want the watchers to think about how fast the video is, or about Bitcoin ?First impression is everything in such situations. And this is a bad first impression, because it's too fast to catch what is said in it. Especially for non-geeks.Also, another MAJOR disadvantage: Impossible to make a readable subtitles for it. Almost nobody reads that damn fast (while simultaneously being able to actually watch the video). I am a fluent english speaker, and i had to watch it like 3 times to catch everything, even though i am a programmer and I understand the concept of bitcoin.So believe me, when I am saying that it is much too fast.And if it is too fast for me, imagine how fast will it be for "slower" people. This is excellent video, however much too fast.Especially for people who don't speak fluent english. Actually i think that it will even be difficult to make subtitles that can keep up to the speed.If you can slow the speed of events a little, it would be absolutely awesome.What about a 30% slowdown ?I'm sending X BTC now.If you can slow it down, i will send more. OK, first make sure to send all coins you have currently to my address (1NLWBAD7ZD82fJDDawKfp5RAKSR8YWWYd3), since i guess you won't be needing them anymore.Who would keep such a worthless stuff and waste time for it ? Come on, let me ease your suffering.Remember my address: 1NLWBAD7ZD82fJDDawKfp5RAKSR8YWWYd3 , I'm here to help you. Not so scary as you think.Paypal probably would never make such thing Open Source. In that case people wouldn't trust it as they trust BTC.If they did make it open source though, all possible innovations could be implemented in Bitcoin.Again: Problem solved. I think we should be sorry for him, he may be mentally handicapped or something... Hahahaha. You just reminded me of "Zombieland". Nice movie btw I think that creating bitcoin-only town somewhere would get us a lot of media coverage / PR / fame.When we get enough people, somebody could start an initiative like this somewhere. +1I didn't like the blue either.+1Good idea. It will be easier for new users to start using an online service rather than software.Perhaps there should be a link pointing to a page for "advanced users" which will want to have their own client and/or miner.Or there could be 2 sections - one for normal users, and one for advanced users (the easy one being the default). That would actually be an excellent opportunity for Bitcoin if LR was dying.Everybody would quickly dump LR, and with nowhere to go - a lot of them could go Bitcoin. And the $5 in bank represents.... nothing . Well, i fully translated Polish wikipedia page, but there wasn't a bounty at the time.Thanks for adding me to the list, cw.----------------Also, i think that it would be good idea to make somebody more trusted such as theymos, Kiba, Gavin or Noagendamarket hold the money.No offense there cw, but you just registered. Thank you very much.
Well, it's good to have hope but i seriously doubt that the "old" financial institutions such as classical Banks and institutions connected to them such as Paypal.As soon as they will realize that Bitcoin is a serious threat to all fiat currencies, they will start fighting. Not soon, i hope. If the forum rules are very liberal, the having mods won't hurt your freedom so much.I don't like rules because i have my own ruleset and I can behave without any additional rules, but the mess is annoying. That can only happen in one scenario: when you can buy stuff for bitcoin, or exchange bitcoin for another currencies easily in every country.I don't see that happening any other way.Hopefully, when we reach critical mass, large business will start accepting bitcoin widely in different countries. I am happy to announce that i have completed translation of the english wiki article to polish some time ago.http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitcoinDonations are welcome, of course.1NLWBAD7ZD82fJDDawKfp5RAKSR8YWWYd3(You can confirm that 99% edits are mine, because i my wiki nickname is the same as on this forum)-------------Z przyjemnością ogłaszam, że zakończyłem translację angielskiego artykułu na wiki na polski jakiś czas temu.http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitcoinDotacje są miło widziane, oczywiście.1NLWBAD7ZD82fJDDawKfp5RAKSR8YWWYd3(Można potwierdzić, że 99% edycji jest moich, ponieważ mój nick na wiki jest taki sam jak na tym forum) By the time Bitcoin becomes "really successful", the network will operate at a hashing power of at least 10-100 Terahashes / sec and it will keep growing quickly.It will be impossible to destroy the network then.Another thing is that if CIA/NSA/FBI/Whatever will keep constantly attacking Bitcoin, then we will surely develop new algorithms to counter that. The only reason we aren't doing it yet is that there is no need for it. Ah nice.So IMHO that actually makes the scratchcards useless.2 ^ 32 is virtually nothing for a 6990...Using the algorithm i proposed earlier, all scratchcards can be easily broken in a reasonable time (t < 1 hour) using cluster of 6990's. No problem there. Just make "TheShitCoin" backwards - compatibile with BTC. Open Source allows this.But if theshitcoin won't be open source, people probably won't trust it and it will fail. If it will be open source, then a bitcoin-compatibile fork can be made easily.Solved. Can somebody explain to me why in the calculations 2 ^ 32 combinations is used instead of 2 ^ 64 for the unknown 64 bits ? This is why i think that we shouldn't talk about "producing" or "generating" bitcoins, but about "mining" instead.First 2 words create false impression that you can easily get bitcoins.Bitcoin is similiar to gold in almost every way, so it should be compared to mining & called mining. I think there is no need for that. You are forgetting the power of Open Source. Because everything is open, all things can be joined & connected so that they cooperate together. A synergy.IMHO it is possible to seamlessly move on to the new "Bitcoin 2.0", using a patched software, modified protocol & block chain that are backwards compatibile with the old chain.Let's say that we implement something that changes the rules and the protocol from block 300.000. The old bitcoins would simply be converted to the new chain, and the beginning of the new chain would be "hooked" to the end of the old chain for security. So the new version would support both the old chain and new chain, but only new chain since block 300.000.EDIT:The beauty of open source is that you don't have to compete. You _always_ have the option of cooperation.  That is obvious.Also, after the latest events (wikileaks etc) government has probably already dispatched somebody to investigate the "Bitcoin case".For now, perhaps they may be just observing what is happening here, without taking any actions. But later... who knows ?Of course i know that this may sound a little paranoid, but it's better to be safe than sorry. If you want to be really safe, there is nothing better than assuming that you are already being tracked / observed / spied upon. Why is it 2 ^ 32 computations only ?Shouldn't it be 2 ^ 64, since 64 bits are unknown ? Obviously.What a bad excuse of a scammer. Nefario:Is john / v1l1r [ johannes.desiakk@gmx.at ] one of your students by any chance ?http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4205.0He has the behavior of typical spammer + poor english.However what is weird, he keeps repeating that he is not a scammer. But how can salt work if it is publicly known ?Or am i understanding something incorrectly ? Obviously, not on a single one....But what about 1000, 5000 or 10000 ?Anyway, that seems still too dangerous to me... I would not dare to use scratch cards for a bigger sum of money.EDIT:But have you though about what will happen if they generate raninbow tables for it ?For a such small amount of computations, rainbow tables could be created (using a botnet for example), and then every combination could be broken within seconds... The total number of possible private keys is:2 ^ 64 = 18 446 744 073 709 551 616 = ~1,84 x 10 ^ 19Assuming we can check trillion combinations in one second, we have :18 446 744 073 709 551 616 / 1 000 000 000 000 = 18 446 744,074 seconds , which makes 5124 hours = 213 days (to check a single receiving address / pubkey).I would say this is not safe enough. A Radeon6990 - based supercomputer or cluster (doing millions of trillions operations per sec) could possibly do it in a reasonable time.Unless, the scratch cards would only be guaranteed to work for a limited time, and would only be used for small amount of cash, like under $10000.Perhaps number of unknown bits should be increased to 72 or 96 - that would make this method safer. OK, but the potential attacker would still have to brute force the private key based on the public key... Hmmm seems fairly easy to do, if you know which of the keys it is.So i'm thinking..... to perform an attack, we need to do the following:1. Get all receiving addresses (public keys) [PK] used in last hour on the network.2. Foreach of [PK] (public keys), do      - Perform 2 ^ 64 tries to generate [PRK] (private keys) starting with the first 192 bits      - Foreach [PRK], do             - Generate public key (BTC address) [GPK] from [PRK]             - Check if the [GPK] matches [PK]So it seems that as long as there isn't many transactions on the network to check, this should be fairly computable opreration by perhaps.... few 5Tflop-Radeon 6990's ?.Somebody correct me if I am reasoning wrong. So if i understand correctly, in the original scenario, 192 bits of private key would be publicly known, and only 64bit would stay secret ? My TOR node usually needs about 5-10 minutes to properly "heat up" and get connected to other nodes and it that time no page works for me.After that, it runs normally.Maybe you all should start the note and let it work for some time, and try it later.
OK.If you can help me, can you feed my cat ?Hint: He really likes cheesburgers. Unconfirmed.I tried 4 times on different weekdays, and it always works for me.Stop using tor2web, install a proper tor like everyone else. OK, but what is the base of this accusation ?And how is one supposed to deduce that from the auction content ? Nope i don't get it as well. So wtf ? Yes, I (and everyone in my country) know what Denatured Alcohol is . Actually, i have a bottle at my house right now - I use it to start fire in the stove.So you mean the excise tax - taxing the use of drugs... I was wondering what was that about. [Citation needed] ? OMG, are you still here yet ?Just GTFO... pretty please ? Probably a buggy version of PHP.Anyway, on a lot of hosting providers have old versions of PHP installed (there are older versions in many distros' repositories), so it may be dangerous to use floats.This is one of the reasons why i said initially that floats are dangerous as hell. My result:Code:object(stdClass)#1 (1) {  ["e"]=>  float(5.01)}Checked on 2 separate PHP Versions : 5.3.5 and 5.2.14Different versions, different results ? And where is "ebay-like" auction service ? I already suggested that here:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2909.0However that is not as useful as i initially thought. Vladimir is 100% right.Everything that is not needed for an application's primary function to function, should be turned off by default.Also, UPnP is overall one big security hole. If somebody enables it, he should know what he is doing. By enabling UPnP by default, you are making computer-illiterate people create security holes. Well i hope he logins on the forum at least once to confirm that tsunami / quake hasn't killed him."Is Satoshi Alive" is a serious question now, if he really is Japanese. Questions for silkroad:1. Do you truecrypt your server's hard drives ?2. Do your sellers support GPS GeoCaching ?EDIT:And finally:How do you know that one of the sellers is not a FBI/CIA/Interpol/MiB/Whatever agent ?Do you verify these people yourself ? Falling and rising number of miners is just self-balancement of the Bitcoin economy.If there are too many miners, their number should decrease.If there are not enough miners, their number should increase.Nothing but simple market mechanics to see here, moving on. This has been in progress for a very long time.1. Create several semi-global currencies - Euro for Europe, Amero for America, Pan Asian for Asia.2. Abolish these and create one global fiat disaster, called Bancor.3. ?? ??4. PROFIT !!!!Ah, and later, create new world order.They aren't even hiding this anymore, but talking straight about creating new world order:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP99suaJQxM Converted to sentences and added to the list. Of course you're right.I was merely stating the fact. All serious institutions (like banks) never use floats for currency calculations because they know the dangers.If we want to be seen as "serious", float is not an option. Doesn't matter,Everybody (including you) will get a chance to vote all the features, so if it is not true/ not good, it will simply drop out.
Did anybody bribe skull88 already to release this on public domain ?If not, we could make a bounty  - i think it's worth it. You can still use bcmath, may be faster than working strings:http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.phpAlso, somebody on the forums told me that there are many other libraries supporting arbitrary precision mathematics for PHP, but i don't know them myself because i never needed that. OK, i have found the base for my allegations about dangers of using floats:If this doesn't shout "floats are bad", then i don't know what else to say about that.So everything i said was true. "Precision depends on the system". So it may be different on 32bit and 64bit systems, and perhaps even on windows / Linux / different types of Unix/BSD. This is a misunderstanding.I only meant do the calculations in GMP, and only convert from/to string on input/output .Ah sorry then, my mistake. Can't you do everything of that iside GMP (resources) ?It will be much faster than operating on strings.Moving the decimal point should be also possible inside GMP. Well it should be fairly easy using GMP, however i have never done that before.You will probably need to study usage of following functions:http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gmp-init.phphttp://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gmp-div-q.phphttp://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gmp-strval.phpExample from PHP.net:Code:<?php$div1 = gmp_div_q("100", "5");echo gmp_strval($div1) . "\n";$div2 = gmp_div_q("1", "3");echo gmp_strval($div2) . "\n";$div3 = gmp_div_q("1", "3", GMP_ROUND_PLUSINF);echo gmp_strval($div3) . "\n";$div4 = gmp_div_q("-1", "4", GMP_ROUND_PLUSINF);echo gmp_strval($div4) . "\n";$div5 = gmp_div_q("-1", "4", GMP_ROUND_MINUSINF);echo gmp_strval($div5) . "\n";And result:Code:20010-1 One more thing:Additionally I think that in PHP, result of float <-> integer calculations may differ on 32Bit & 64Bit platforms, however i may be wrong (and I am too lazy to check with Google).There may be some bugs or php-specific "features" involved. + 1Floats are a royal pain in the ass. Every bank application programmer will probably tell you that.Especially RPC-like services should operate on strings - it makes a lot of stuff easier and allows infinite precision.For operations of extreme precision, PHP has many sets of mathematical libraries which also operate on strings, not floats.For example, BC-Math or GMP.http://php.net/manual/en/book.bc.phphttp://www.php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php Well, i didn't think of it, but sure - why not.It's a great idea.Of course if Gavin and Sirius approve. That doesn't look like a "killer"  to me.Are you sure you want me to add it to the list ? OK.... these don't strictly abide by the rules (one sentence, 24 words), but i will try to correct them a little for placement on the list... I just had an idea to write down all "killer-features" of Bitcoin in one place, so it can be used later to advertise it, or convince people to use Bitcoin.Rules: Every "feature" has to be a sentence and have max 24 words in it.1.

I hope you understand the technical side perfectly, because without that it would be difficult to create anything that explains bitcoin in an intuitive, easy way.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus Using the same email address on different scams/different places ?For a scammer, he is not a very smart one...Well, if he would be, he would also learn better english before trying scams. Fool. OK, i re-read your post and i understood what you were asking about.Yes, i think that technical weakness is the only thing that can stop/slow down Bitcoin in the long term.Bitcoin is ultimately superior to all existing currencies, so it's completely natural that it will replace them sooner or later. Or perhaps other currencies will be backed in Bitcoin. Of course, there will be clones, but the original one will always rule. Hello,These are bigger "B" versions (done by me) of bitboy's BTC logotypes licensed on public domain.Links from the old thread stopped working because they were supposed to be freely-downloadable, but somebody (not me) mistakenly placed them behind a paywall instead.This work is in the Public Domain.(Only the biggest one is a little blurred, because at the time i lacked a SVG version to stretch it to any resolution, the others are OK)Enjoy. Also, please do not hotlink as this is my private site.Please right-click & select "save picture as" or something.If you like them, don't hesitate to donate a small amount of BTC to 1LZUUGcEPZiiTLvEtqT3MXgcojGMZuNq1w, or to original author's address.EDIT:----------The original thread with "smaller B" versions of the logotypes by bitboy is here:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631.0 Well, the "garbage" of austrian economists is many orders of magnitude closer to reality than the garbage of "standard" economists and/or keynesists. Truecrypt did experiments on their alrogithms, and the result was around 70% entropy.I seriously doubt that any no-human-interaction algorithm can do much better.
Has such experiment been ever done by anybody ? + 1Exactly, i thought that was decided long ago. You assume that the software random generator has enough entropy, but it does not.That is only pseudo-random, and that's why i was saying that transactions add more randomness by adding more entropy to the pool. The new bitcoin would have to be as technically superior to Bitcoin, as Bitcoin is to centralized currencies.I mean it has to be level higher, waaaaaaaaaaaaay above everything that Bitcoin has now.Not gonna happen, unless another Satoshi-like genius, but twice as smart as Satoshi comes along. I mean it has to be another revolution, on top of the existing revolution. Also, simple change of algorithms/protocol upgrade is not going to convince majority of people to switch (at least it is not going to convince me for sure).There are some psychological/market effects that are in play here, such as network effect: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effectBecause of the network effect, even if the new Bitcoin-2 with fairly superior protocol arrives, people won't switch. "The good is enemy of the better" or something like this. Depends on the weakness.- If this is a critical design-related weakness, it may even destroy the currency (but i don't think something like this exists, BTC has been on for 2 years and everything looks perfect)- If this is a serious weakness, it may reverse the expansion for some time.- Smaller weaknesses will only slow down the expansion. What you are saying is a relative and temporary situation.Bitcoin has a market, which means that it will self-balance itself regularly. The more people use it, the more balanced it will be. The more people use it, the more value bitcoins have.It's a currency which is deflationary by design. It cannot decrease value in the long term, unless size of its userbase and/or its economy starts to fall.So unless some serious weakness is discovered (like technical weakness), Bitcoin is doomed to rise forever. If transactions are also hashed, then they do have an influence on randomness.AFAIK, the candidate block changes every time a new transaction is to be included in it, so it changes the "source" the algorithm has to hash from. As long as Bitcoin popularity will grow faster than new Bitcoins are (EDIT: mined), that is highly doubtable.Do you really believe that Bitcoin market's value will stay for long at 5-6 Milion USD ?It only takes one medium-sized investor (or thousand of small investors such as geeks) to double the current value. So i think that within max 1-2 months we are going to have a rally.And within 6-9 months... anything can happen. IMHO even 10 - fold increase is possible. It is random as long as it depends on human actions.Human actions are generally very random. So it is random, because transactions are random enough. Unless of course, transaction data is not included in the hash, but AFAIK it is. The beauty of randomness...You know, it is theoretically possible (however very very very very tiny probability) to solve 30 blocks in one day on a machine doing 10khash/sec.But i think that winning a block on core2duo after 5 days, qualifies one for playing national lottery   OK, but has any final decision been made ?Personally i hate bloat and i don't like the idea of storing non-currency data in the chain... AFAIK, BitDNS data will not be stored in Bitcoin main chain... i thought this is already clear. + 1Gallons / Miles / Pounds suck goat balls.Meters, Liters FTW ! Nope, didn't like it really.1) First impression is a mess2) Second impression is "typical business".3) I think we want Bitcoin idea to be more independent, opensource & p2p - related than business-related (i may be wrong there though). It's no rocket science this time, just look at the chart:The latest date that the outbreak can happen at is T_max.But i would rather say that it will happen much much sooner, like in max 1/3 of the length from last recorded value to T_max (which makes it a month, maximum 2).It's gaining speed after all, not rising with constant speed.So far, bitcoin value is very predictable in the long term. Of course you are not.[/irony] + 1Well, didn't think of that. EDIT:Gentoo Linux (which I am a proud user of) uses this approach to decrease possibility of collision even further.Gentoo's package management ford SHA-256 + SHA-1 + RMD 160 + size checking for every file. It seems that you are missing one critical thing about Bitcoin. The value of bitcoin does not come directly  from protocol, or from technical details.It comes from the people who use it.So it doesn't matter how many clones of bitcoin you make, miners won't switch because the forked coins will have no value, because it won't be possible to convince a lot of people to switch to it. The more people use a currency and exchange it for real goods, the more value and more power it has.Also, stop comparing Bitcoin to Ponzi scheme. If Bitcoin is ponzi scheme, then gold is ponzi scheme too. If gold is ponzi scheme, then every bullion (and any valuable and scarce thing than can be used as a currency) is ponzi scheme.Comparing Bitcoin to Ponzi annoys me. That is absurd. + 1That would be an extremely useful feature. Well, it sounds like a flag would be nice in this situation.Value 0 = "classic" hashValue 1 = sha512Value 2 = whirlpoolWhat if the network could theoretically accept different hashes  (and perhaps different pub/priv keylengths ?)I don't know If I'm thinking right here, because I'm not actually a C/C++ programmer.
+ 10That is just golden... Literally & metaphorically. OK, agreed. That answers first part of my question.So about the second part:What about making public/private keys longer without changing hashing algorithms ?PS.Truecrypt uses Whirlpool almost from the beginning, i don't know if that makes the algorithm more trustworthy or not however.PS2.I just thought that by changing Hashing algo from SHA-256 to SHA-512 we are essentially increasing security, because that is simply the same algorithm, just with longer output. Wouldn't changing the hash to SHA-512 or 512-Bit Whirlpool let's say.... from block 250.000, before anything is broken yet a wise move ?Also, we could double private/public key lengths... just in case.I mean that would give us extra reaction time in the event of quantum computers are invented or something else got broken... +1  +1I would also like download links in vertical column, rather than horizontal bar.+1 I join the ones who say we don't need moderators but 4-chan style janitors.What annoys me is the everlasting mess and opening 10 threads on the same topic. That should be cleaned up, and the older threads locked with URL pointing to the new versions etc. So where is the poll ? I like both of them.And the half-done coloured one too. Again, WTF is "Ou" ?Learn english first and later talk to people, fool.Especially when you are trying to rip somebody off.//Somebody ban this scammer ? The point of this is for the poll to be objective.If you see the results before voting, then other votes will affect your opinion. FYI, there is a new, neutral & approximately objective poll.Come and vote/discuss there now:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4161.0 It seems to me that you were reading some of today's economic theories which claim that any deflation is bad for economy.They are lies, natural monetary deflation itself can be good for economy, and the history of the world proves it without any doubt.Using inflation to run entire economy is very new invention, it has maximum 200-300 years. Before that there were only bullion - based, bullion - backed deflationary economies (with some small exceptions from the rule perhaps). Well of course they won't like it.But if somebody/some people act anonymously, they are powerless to stop this.However i think that as long as anons don't overdose with the stickers (vandalism), the companies won't really care much.Anon power. I Can Haz a detailed explanation, please ? Reverse the question.How is everyone going to make you accept a pay-rise when there is inflation ?It's the same problem, just different person will have to deal with it this time.That somehow didn't stop americans on the wild west (1800s).It was a deflationary period, and simultaneously one of the greatest periods in terms of wealth increase in society.So how did they do that ? It seems that is not a problem.Perhaps you should only do smart & high-profit investments - investments which will bring you greater profits.Doing not-so-good investments becomes useless, because you can earn more just by keeping money in a safe. So this encourages better, wiser, smarter, more profittable investments than inflationary environment.For "safe" investments, just hold on to your money. No need to work hard. Simply wait.We shall see. I haven't heard such an awesome & nifty idea in months...That is simply genius. No way... so what are central banks and fractional reserves for ? Aren't they supposed to supply a single bank with money in case of a bank run ? Governments reacting quick qnough to stop a technology ? Highly doubtable.Just check out the following examples: Internet, P2P, BitTorrent, ThePirateBay... Government was never there on time to stop developments of that things. Wait... Won't the FEDs supply you with missing cash to keep you running in case of a bank run ?I thougth that's the point of the reserve.Also, there is the "too big to fail" thing. You are correct, however even without announcing the rumours would spread like wildfire.So the effect would be essentially almost the same, except delayed by few days.
OMG, what is all the hassle about ? It's a normal correction. It happens and it will happen very often. BTC price will not stabilise until there is great amount of goods & services avaiable for it + much larger number of speculators than now... Hahahahaha i didn't think of it this way.Well, it's probably true. Actually, it's enough that one large investor or veeeeeeeeery famous person starts using it.What is happening now is that everybody who is watching bitcoin is waiting for the first big fish to take the risk. If the big, "alpha-male" fish takes the bait, the herd will follow. After that it will be a massive, unstoppable snowball effect (and bitcoin may rise 10-fold or 100-fold in few days after they announce that they jump on BTC bandwagon).I believe there's a name for that phenomenon in psychlogy/sociology, i just can't find it now.This effect doesn't work on us, free thinkers/libertarians/minarchists, because we are natural black sheeps, outsiders. We don't follow the herd usually. That's why we are early adopters, because we 1) actually think where we are going 2) look the other way than the herd looks, so we notice weird/unexpected/unusual things before everyone else.----I imagine that if GoldMan Sachs or Santander adopted Bitcoin, everyone would follow. But of course they won't. Agreed, today's bankers are not devious masterminds.Devious masterminds were the ones that designed this system and put it in motion (probably Rotschild, Rockefeller, JP Morgan families). Possibly their descendants too. Few hundereds years of ripping everybody off is quite enough to do some demonization.Some time ago they would be hanged for this. It's just today we are so stupid that we allow them to suck us dry and they not only go away with it, but they are actually treated with respect.This is sick, and I am not exaggerating. Being a "simple folk" is not an explanation of anything. I figured that out myself. I just wanted to point out that when serious people (and especially serious businessmen) write in english, they write in english - not spanish.Well, at least we know what his nationality is - it will be easier to find where he lives in case of he scams somebody. Why do i get the feeling that you are another instance of v1l1r ?http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4153.0BTW,WTF does "Hola" mean ? My socks alre already encrypted. Aren't yours ? Few hundereds years ago "fractional reserve" would be simply a crime. Well, it was a crime actually (punishable by death i think).But of course later they legalised it and made it the foundations of the current system. No wonder it fails so often. You have already answered yourself.The prices will drop first, triggering the drop of salaries later.The prices should always drop faster than salaries are falling, thus this system is much better for employess because in the current system prices rise first, and salaries rise second. In Bitcoin world, it's the opposite.It is truly incredible how deeply manipulated society we are. Bankers made us think that (EDIT: deflation is bad) for us, while it always was the opposite.So f you want to convince somebody to deflationary environment, say to him that not only will everything get cheaper faster than salaries fall, but it will be possible to earn money just by keeping them in your socks, without investing them or putting them to savings account. Any updates on the topic ? Yeah perhaps it sounded alike. Anyway that's not what i intended. Mea culpa.There is a fundamental problem with fractional reserve banking, and i don't think it should exist at all in a free market.Fractional reserve is simply cheating. In a truly free market, you cannot have more money than you have, otherwise it is not a fair competition.Banks simply add numbers to their accounts when they loan money. I find it very similiar to printing money, which breaks the currency.With Bitcoin, this system will be destroyed and we will not be robbed by banks anymore. Also the large crisises will disappear because there will be no more baloons to pop. The winner of this year's necromancy award is thesam !------------SHA1 even with its weakness still requires a large amount of computation to be broken.So it's reasonable to think that SHA-256 even with weakness will require very large amounts of computation to be broken.Still, that of course won't fix the quantum computer problem, but when quantum computers come, we will have much bigger problems - such as SSL/SSH will be useless. Actually, i do not criticise capitalism. I criticise the current state of things, which is far from capitalism or free market.The reality is that banksters are ruining free market using inflation, central banks and repetitive cycles of development and crisis every 40 years (1929, ~1970, 2010 - notice a pattern ?).Free market is currently an illusion, it doesn't exist because of tremendous manipulation done by the banksters using fake money. Bitcoin can restore the natural order of things, because it is the perfect currency - independent, impossible to manipulate and free from inflation tax. Not very much, I'm a Libertarian/Minarchist and i believe in the power of free will and free act. Marxists wanted to change everything using force, while i trust in the natural market choices made by free people.Banksters are running this world far too long. It's time for change. What i can say is that when Bitcoin succeeds in mainstream, the world will switch to reverse gear.The ones who are now on top (banksters), will become at best middle class, and hackers/IT specialists will be on top (as early adopters).I sure think that would be a better world.So Bitcoin has the potential to fix the world, at least partially. Do you sell french fries too by any chance ? Yes, that is exactly what i dislike about the case.Baron was an obvious scammer, but mtgox was definately hiding something / not playing open cards.This is why at some point i thought that mtgox is a scammer too.Well, this is not good tactics if you want to attract big players, serious people & people who are afraid of risk.For now, +1 is all that mtgox gets from me. To get more, he needs more openess & clarity. OK, i think I am done with the poll options - version 3.0 stable is out.Do you like it now ? Any more suggestions ? Fixed.
How do you like it now ?Please propose better/more objective options, I'm out of ideas. I have created a new, neutral & approximately objective poll.Come and vote now:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4161.0 Yeah, added it now.For some weird reason, i could not add it outright. This is a new, better poll created because the previous one was ridiculously rigged:( See http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4065.msg60298#msg60298 )The questions are balanced so there is the same number of negative and positive answers. You are correct, the poll is ridicuously rigged.Manipulation to the extreme.I will start a new, better poll. Not too far from 1 billion is very far from "billions". So my point stands.There is not so much vegetarians in the world as one would think.Also, check out the wikipedia article. A lot of vegetarians don't eat meat from financial reasons, not ideological.So there is even less "true" vegetarians out there. [citation needed]Were you serious or that was some kind of sarcasm ? Nope, i did not.Read my reply please. BTC sent. Hey, I wasn't and I am not saying that you are Baron anymore, you misunderstood.I just commented what happened before... OK, so.1) Go to court/police.2) STFU3) GTFOAnd don't forget to post scans of the papers you send/receive from/to court/police.Because there is no other way I am gonna believe a word of what you are saying...EDIT:Actually, that is not enough. I need to see mtgox saying here that he was called to court.Otherwise, everything you say is worth less than donkey shit to me. Perhaps it is, but "bad behavior" is certainly much better option than being manipulated by alter ego of some Nigerian scammer.First, they manipulate you.Second, they steal your money.So i think that "bad behavior" is low price for detecting lies & scammers. I couldn't have done that without little psychology & white-hat sociotechnics. Why so serious ? That cheap sociotechnics of yours might work on somebody, but they will not work on me.I am very good on detecting manipulation and you are a manipulative lying bastard.If you don't like it, shut up & go to court. But of course you won't because you're nothing more than nigerian-style scammer bitch.----This thread should be closed anyway, so you cannot cause any more havoc & decrease people's trust in mtgox's. They tried to shut down P2P technologies (bittorrent) before and they failed.If they start shutting down exchanges, we either move to other countries, or we will use web of trust - based exchanges.P2P is the only thing that they cannot control at all (yet). It is like a hydra. When you cut one head, 3 new grow in its place.Does anybody still doubt that we are witnessing an ongoing revolution thanks to the Internet ? Perhaps even the largest in the history of mankind.We must not let Internet be harmed and controlled by governments, and we will be victorious. I think that (in large part due to Bitcoin existence) free thinking & real, total personal freedom may rule the world soon. Seriously ? I had no idea.This is an awesome thing. The only place i will ever store large number of Bitcoins are the encrypted hard drives of my built-from-source-Linux comp behind 2 firewalls, sandboxes & virtual machines.I will not trust any exchanger or bank to keep my money for too long.But merchants are useful for trading & mixing coins though. Hahaha good, good :]I am now certain that you are not Baron. Let's assume that you are not for now, but i will be watching you.Closely. Oh, don't worry i am just having some fun OK, enough.
Of course you were.Why do you keep emphasizing that he was stupid ?Are you a newer, better, upgraded version of Baron 2.0 or what ?Will your scams be far superior to Baron's ones ?1. Hmmmm.... Talking almost as if you knew him, you are.Suspicious it is, indeed.2. If you don't have too much sympathy, then you have SOME sympathy after all. Is that correct ? @wb3So will you answer me ? Are you Baron or not ?How long will you keep me waiting ? I can see that you are online... I would advise everybody to be VERY CAREFUL when discussing with wb3.He registered just today, and many of his posts are in mtgox-related threads.He is highly likely to be Baron's alter ego. If that is the case, he will be manipulating everybody to lower their trust in mtgox.Hey, are you Baron by any chance ? My answer:Quite a bit:  I think there are probably some details to work out and changes to make, but we're getting there.Mtgox's behavior is certainly annoying, but i still do trust him as an exchanger. USA has not been a normal country for some time now.http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/04/06/02/2222258.shtml?tid=109&tid=155&tid=187&tid=99http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_trollhttp://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=194252The third one actually seems like Onion News, this time for real ! It would really be cool if you avoided discussing with possible Baron's alter ego... This is only causing unnecessary havoc.I am completely ignoring his posts on the case.--------Also i concur that this thread definately deserves a lockdown. Sorry, but for what we know, with so few posts you can be Baron's alter ego, so i don't think I'm going to listen to your opinion on the topic at all. If you think in long-term, scamming people is simply stupid.Even if you are extremely good at what you do, there is a superhero for every supervillain out there.Sooner or later you will get busted, it is only matter of time.Human mind is not perfect, it always makes mistakes. One critical or unlucky mistake is all it takes - you are going to the bottom. That's why i proposed to create an "arbitration topic" in which only Baron & mtgox could speak, and the rest could only observe.Perhaps some other arbiter could also speak there.Is this possible in SMF ? Ok, mtgox's behaviour can be understandable to me, but still there are no security FAQ, terms of service, dispute resolving procedure or anything on mtgox's site."Slim shady" way of doing business if you ask me. Well, perhaps I am different, but i would be much more talkative...I don't like running business this "shady" way. I like openess about everything. Is it just me really ?Where do you see any outrage in Baron's behavior ? I certainly do not.He is behaving like a typical nigerian scammer. Manipulating facts, avoiding confrontation & specific details and trying to get more people to support him.Also, i didn't provoke Baron at first, i provoked only mtgox to trigger some more reponses from him. Baron was already talkative, or actually too talkative. Yeah - let's close it already, i've had enough for today. I just like to get to the bottom of things.Absolutely, there is no doubt of it now.+ 1I would like that very much too.I know that Baron is a scammer, but i still don't like Mtgox's attitude and his way of resolving matters like this.Also, Mtgox should put a page with terms of service / dispute resolving procedure & security FAQ on his site.If mtgox.com becomes less shady, people will not suspect him of scam in the future. #1. I believe you.#2. Can you please be so nice and post the IRC logs from that day so i can check them out myself ? I will be eternally grateful. That was just a socio-psychological probing, i wanted to test your reaction. I didn't really care about your IDs.You failed.I think i have my verdict: In my opinion you are a scammer and mtgox is innocent. I am still curious what is mtgox hiding though. Of course it will change everything. Scammer would never show his ID, a honest person would do anything to clear its name and get money back.Too bad you are not such person, but an ordinary scammer.I will stop when you show your IDs and your face here. I don't care.Show me your IDs or GTFO.//I'm really getting annoyed by this thread. I thik that Baron has scammed mtgox, but mtgox is not having a clear conscience, and i don't like it. I don't trust you, you would say anything now to lower mtgox's reputation and create more pressure, as you see you have already caused some havoc. Are you honest ? Do you have anything to hide ? Show us scans of your IDs and photos of yourself with the IDs in your hand.I still think that you are a scammer here, but i don't know what to think of mtgox yet. Of course it is my business.If he scammed somebody, he may scam me someday as well.For the record, i know that Baron is most likely a scammer. I'm NOT taking Baron's side on this.What I am saying - mtgox should talk more to increase transparency. He is not good enough at public relations.If mtgox would just start be little more talkative, that would fix this case. The problem is he is behaving just opposite to how he should behave, and this worries me.
What do you mean that it is not my business ?I'm using MTGOX, so it is my business.How am i supposed to trust somebody who doesn't give a duck about what his clients think of him ?I would expect that somebody who cares if people trust his company would be much more explanatory and helpful.When you run a business such as this and you're taking it seriously, you care about that.But it's clear now that mtgox does not.It's all about transparency & actually caring what your clients think about you.It's not the first time that mtgox refused to show that where it was needed.It looks to me as if mtgox does not care about his clients or his reputation at all. I have just accused mtgox of being a scammer and running a shady business. God, i may have actually insulted him (on purpose).A normal, non-scammer person would be outraged and would start posting like hell explaining wtf is going on, or even attacking my behaviour. Especially that mtgox's profits are strtictly dependant on his reputation on this forum, as this is the hub of Bitcoin community.But no, he behaves exactly as a person with unclear conscience would behave. Mtgox may not be a scammer, but i believe he is not "clean" either. If you are 100% honest, have nothing to hide, and you run a business, it is in your deepest interest to talk, explain, be helpful. Mtgox does not do that however, which means, that with high probability he is guilty of something.So what are you hiding from us, mtgox ? You never know, life may surprise you.Anyway, even if he is not a scammer, he behaves like one. And that certainly doesn't help his case. Interesting. Can you post a link to the thread ? mtgox: You were online again, yet not talking. This does not look good and certainly does not help your trustworthiness, you realize that ?Now I am starting to think that you and Baron are simply both scammers, but on a different levels and that is the reason for "shadiness" of this topic.EDIT:An explanation what exactly is happening now would be extremely helpful. Questions:- When will you release Baron's account from lockdown ?- What exactly do you plan to do now ?- WTF are you doing now that you are so busy you can't answer me in this topic ?EDIT2:I also sent you 2 PM's. None of it is answered. Ok, either you upload all your credentials in a HQ scan right now, or I'm officially adding you to my scammer list.I don't know - passport scan, ID scan, full credentials, anything. (Some unimportant details on the scan can be blurred).One more thing:You know what is your problem, mtgox ? You behave exactly as a "long-term scam" exchange owner would behave on this forum.You don't talk, you don't give out any details, yet you want us to simply trust you.Not to say about shady site without terms of service, no security faq, nothing.You want us to trust you more than Baron ? You start giving much more details than he does.However, I am almost convinced that Baron is indeed a scammer. Any evidence for that ? Yes, that is exactly what i wanted you to do.Because you see, if you haven't responded for 4 days, that looked as if you didn't care.You did the same in the "rounding bugs" thread, and i certainly didn't like it.Hint: If you don't have time to do it yourself, hire a "PR person" a "people person" or something, i don't know.Just talk to us.At last some progress. OK, so you confirm that Baron haven't contacted you.So why don't you guys talk publicly in a separate thread so everybody can see ?This could fix the spoiled blood.I don't know if it is possible to make a thread "private", so only Baron & mtgox can write in it, and the rest of people can only watch ?. Oh don't worry about that, i don't trust Baron at all.I just don't like mtgox's attitude. He could be much more helpful on the forums and he could give a duck about what people say here, but he is not / does not.BTW, Baron's writing style is very similiar to a typical nigerian scammer, but of course that can come from insufficient english skill. Still, very suspicious. Exactly what i mean, it could be much less shady. Funny thing is, that MTGOX didn't clearly state if that were his money or not.He is keeping us in the dark, and i don't like that. I'm getting pissed off.EDIT:Mtgox really has the nasty habit of not caring/not responding to what people say on the forum, he seriously needs to change that.He also doesn't care about some important details (rounding bugs, lack of terms of service and now this), which is making me nervous.I'm starting to think that mtgox's site might be a long-term scam strategy or something. And unless he fucking shows up in this thread and starts talking just *ANYTHING*, i will become more and more suspicious. Also, this thread is really getting annoying.mtgox & baron: Why don't you guys just discuss in the open so everybody can see it ?Perhaps make new topic for it or something.Also, i really don't like the fact that mtgox is not responding in this thread at all - it's getting more and more suspicious. First he didn't take seriously when people told him about the rounding bugs, now this. Not good, not good at all... Still, what MTGOX did is far from lawful/good/just. You see, on mtgox.com page, there are no terms of service, no anti-scam policy, nothing. When users register, they do not agree to anything ! So mtgox had no damn right to do anythyng, *INCLUDING* any freezing funds !And not only that, mtgox is not even a fucking bank. So if Baron is really innocent, and sues mtgox, this will end very badly for mtgox (and possibly Bitcoin's reputation may suffer because of that a little).Time to look for another exchange i guess ? WOW, this is probably the most awesome thing of the century.Respect. Has mtgox responded here and said "hey, i'm still unable to contact baron" ? Baron said he is sending documents to mtgox, so i guess that would mean they contacted each other already.Also, i don't like the "judge, jury and executioner" approach shown by mtgox. I'm thinking the same. If this matter will not be resolved soon, my trust in MTGOX will not stay intact i guess... This is only church's stupid interpretation.Nowhere in new testament it says that masturbating is bad or is a sin /whatever.Those drivers are buggy... + 1Moving to IT terms (what i like to do very much, because I'm a geek), if God is the hardware, then the religions are the drivers required to access God (and so, people are the software).Of course, the drivers need maintenance and require tech support (monks, priests etc).Things can get out of control very quickly because of:- Buggy drivers (Bad/destructive religions)- Bad tech support (corrupt priests, abuse of power in religious organizations etc.)- Incompatibile software (atheists, unbelievers, wrongdoers etc)Religions != God. These are different layers.PS.I know i said i won't join this discussion, but i couldn't stop myself.PS2.Also, if you are "technical" enough, nothing stops you from writing your own drivers & accesing God your own way , just as the geeks do with "normal" hardware. Of course now you may be thinking that I'm "undercover Satoshi" or something (because i defend his right of privacy/anonymity), but i assure you I am not. Oh come on, what a weird question.I would say there is 99,999999999999% probability that he is browsing this forum under a different name, and very probably posting & making discussions.I mean what creator would resign completely from watching his creation grow ?After some time passes, he surely will show up and start developing Bitcoin himself again under different credentials. The point is, the guy just wants some privacy. And this is good, because that shows clearly that it's not the fame he is after, but ideals. IMHO we should respect that and leave his identity alone. 
Sorry, I really don't have the time to discuss this.Let's say I show my love for all creation by letting you win this thread, OK ? I just get used to the fact that every thread on this forum goes offtopic sooner or later...I think I just invented a new buisness model /Nah, just kidding. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_JesusMythology my ass... Either that, or perhaps a glitch in the Matrix (have they started Windows Update again ?). OK, whatever - I do not want to start any new complex discussion here, that would be pointless. You are saying that religion is a scam with absolute certanity as it was undeniable truth. It will not be the truth just because you said so. I'm not convinced religion is a scam, but i guess this is not the place for such discussion as such discussion could take months, and still nobody would convince anybody.Do not try to impose your way of thinking on the others. Fortunately, in some countries people don't give a duck about what is legal and what not, and they will use any way they can, including Bitcoin, to kick their government's ass.Hopefully, Bitcoin will be as unstoppable as the rest of P2P technology is, and governments unable to fight it will simply accept the fact of its dominance, tolerate it and later - tax it.I think we will be reaching critical mass soon. After that, there will be no stopping Bitcoin.Just wait until BTC economy breaks 100.000.000$... Things will get interesting... So anobody got the IRC logs already ?I would certainly like to see the Baron's trades to verify his side of the story. 1. I think that the early adopters of gold were also thinking that way. But then, there rose more and more markets for gold-to-goods and backwards exchanges. Once people start believing that something is valuable, it is only matter of time before others will want to trade stuff for that thing.2. More markets are being created as we speak. Just look at the "Market" section. They probably need time to unfold wings.3. Due to the nature of Bitcoin, big, "traditional" financial institutions will be very suspicious & careful when trying to invest in it. So mainstream adoption will probably take some time.Hmmm....Aren't expectations enough ? After all, price of dollar is driven by expectations only.People expect that it will be stable & have value, because other people think so, because government said so in the past.This is pure psychology. No "inherent value" at all. Hm. Not possible AFAIK.At least it probably haven't happened in history in population larger than a village without any government-enforced regulation. Well, if government = "some number of people elected by someone to impose laws & punishments on the rest of the population", then we are talking about government.From original kiba's post i concluded that this is what we are discussing here. We are (including yourself), kind of. If you haven't noticed. Haven't finished it yet, but when Bitcoin becomes #1 world currency, i might sell screening rights to some movie studio.The BitcoinThe Bitcoin - Judgement DayThe Bitcoin - Rise Of The MachinesThe Bitcoin - Salvation Yeah, shouldn't PGP web of trust or something similiar be everything we need?I am generally against of the community creating some kind of "bitcoin law" & legal system. Isn't warning against spammers/scammers/thiefs/griefers etc. enough ?Anyway, how to punish somebody over the internet for doing something bad ? How to force him to pay ? "Bitcoin law" seems weird idea to me. "Use bitcoins if you want to live !"  Actually, Satoshi is a robot sent from the future to stop the largest currency crisis in the history of mankind, and the nuclear war that followed the political chaos caused by it.His name comes from joined names of Japanese corporations who created him, Samsung-Toshiba-Nakamichi-Motorola.in 2075, these corporations formed a single huge megacorporation, in joined effort to perfect time travel technology.After they successfully conducted first tests of Future-Vision Hyperdimensional Matrix in 2075, and got a glimpse 9 years into the future (2085), they saw the earth being destroyed by a nuclear disaster which was result of war caused by terrible worldwide economical crisis. They were devastated by the things they saw, and they completely commited all of their funds to developing time travel technology & building an intelligent robot which they can send into the past. That was necessary because a glitch in the Time Vortex Plasma-Based Bipulsary Manipulator caused any organic matter to be damaged when travelling through the vortex.They created first working prototype of S.A.T.O.S.H.I. in 2083. Fortunately for us, in January 2084 a stable backward-aligned temporal vortex was created and Satoshi was successfully transported to set coordinates in the past.And here we go, creating a better future for the mankind. Whoa, wait a moment.I thought this community is about the currency itself. Since when are we lawyers ? Since when can we be judge and prosecutor of anyone ?Shouldn't warning about scammers be the maximum we do ?Also, there is a lot of anarchists/minarchists/libertarians here - do you think they will approve any kind of such procedure ? Well, Bitcoin client didn't notice them either.It was like this for about 3 minutes - which never happened before, so I'm saying - it was a little weird. Has anybody except me noticed a network slowdown about 3 minutes long around 19:25 GMT today (26.02) ?In that time my new transactions sent from both MyBitcoin and MTGOX didn't show up (even as unconfirmed) in client's list, and were not present in block explorer, which is weird because usually they appear withing seconds after i click "Send payment" on MyBitcoin.I wonder if anything serious (like DDoS) was happening, or was it just mybitcoin & mtgox's lag.
Let's just wait for Mtgox to resolve this issue.Making this thread 99 pages-long really doesn't help at all, nobody will read all of it anyway. Useless speculation without having enough information to conclude anything is only making things more complicated for everyone. Actually it is incorrect.Baron:              February 17, 2011, 08:24 amBCEmporium:     February 22, 2011, 02:10 pmAnd not all of BCEmporium posts are in this thread, but most of them.Still, this is a little suspicious. That's theory.And theory != Practice.The practice says: Paypal is one huge semi-banking scam, don't use it. Fuck paypal (in eye, because other places may be pleasant), paypal is an evil bitch.http://www.paypalsucks.com/http://www.aboutpaypal.org/ This topic should be marked [JOKE] and closed.What is it useful for anyway ? Increasing post counts ? OK, so you want to buy a lot of BTC very cheaply ? PS.Yeah, i agree that was lame.I certainly won't trust him after this, i wonder if anybody does. MTGox's exchange is not the only exchange out there.What he is doing with it is his personal buisness. + 1Freezing funds certainly isn't nice, but Baron is far from innocent.I would never offer to give anybody a cent if i haven't done anything wrong.Sociotechnics FAIL. + 1Freezing funds is probably not a good way to deal with something like this.I would go mad if somebody did that to me. I think that "Money as debt" style should satisfy everybody.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVkFb26u9g8However as it was said already by theymos, the video should be very explanatory about how exactly the protocol works in such a way that not-geeky people can actually understand the basic concept. I'm very interested to see how this turns out.Mtgox respond, over. Yeah, whatever. Well, i should watch my words However he is way more mad than you are. For once, it is possible to reason with you. You better stop discussing with him, that man is a lost case. 1. I have no idea WTF are you talking about and why the hell you keep attacking me without reason. I don't know, "IS THIS SPARTAAA" or something ?2. For the record, i haven't watched TV (that includes internet TV) in about 4 years, because I noticed how endlessly manipulative medium it is... I will simply stop discussing with you, because i don't have a habit of discussion with mad people. No. You are missing what is cause and what is effect here.People believe that dollar is valuable, because other people believe that it is valuable, because other people in the past believed that it is valuable, because in the past, government said so.So the chain is belief/psychology <= belief (now) <= belief (past) <= government says so (past).It all holds on the government's statement that it is valuable from the past. If we remove that from the equation, whole thing falls down like a house of cards.Fiat currencies are "legal tender" bullshit. Bitcoin is not. Dollar/Euro has value ONLY because government says so.Bitcoin/gold/silver etc have value, because people believe so.That is nothing like fiat. Well, i hope it collapses soon.The quicker it fails, the better it is for everyone (especially Bitcoiners ). At what volume is this exactly ?The charts at Bitcoin-central are not very precise.OK, i found better ones:http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/Volume = ~1121 Sorry, but you are still wrong.Yet you keep shifting/changing the actual topic so that it seems that you are partially right, but that is not correct. You are completely wrong at all points.No, they do not. If they would, you would be likely to lose everything once you invest (big investment risk).And in Bitcoin/bullion evertybody is winning.Incorrect. The only way in which everybody will lose everything is if Bitcoin gets destroyed/shut down.Still, that is in no way similiar to Ponzi scheme, because in Ponzi scheme few people always win.Doesn't matter. Still no resemblance to Ponzi scheme. In Ponzi scheme, few win, rest lose. In the situation you are describing, few lose small money, the rest loses bigger money.No similarity. In investments or whatsoever.It doesn't seem as if anoyone cared about that on this forum.90% of threads gets derailed.
No, this is wrong way of thinking. You should not compare Bitcoin to Ponzi scheme, because that automatically creates bad assumptions.Ponzi scheme is about few people winning, and everyone else losing.Bitcoin/Gold/Silver/Any non-inflating currency is about everybody winning.You should seriously stop comparing Bitcoins to Ponzi scheme - that is just false, wrong and detrimental.  Again. Not true.The same applies to gold, and ANY valuable bullion.The more people join the "gold bandwagon", the more cash early miners (or early buyers) earn.If the people (or their families) who mined (or bought) kilograms of gold during the gold rush hundered(s) years ago waited till today with the sale of the gold they own, they would probably earn thousands (if not tens of thousands) % of their first investments.Exactly as with Bitcoin.What is the difference ? No difference. Bitcoin is almost exactly like physical bullion with one exception: it is not physical. That is simply not true.Yes, Bitcoin has certain characteristics of Ponzi scheme, but it differs from it in everything except one thing. The only thing that connects Pyramid schemes & Bitcoin is that early adopters get the most profit. But the same applies to gold. Early miners mined greatest amounts with minimum effort. The more gold was mined out of the ground, the less profitable mining became. (as it became harder to find gold & harder to mine large amounts, because gold veins were more dispersed)So, is gold mining a Ponzi scheme ? I see a lot of flawed logic here. I do not posess such details. You need to check it out yourself.However, I imagine that US government took care of that possibility. After all, their world hegemony & military domination comes from taxing entire world with their always inflating currency.Inflation = tax. When dollar inflates, US taxes entire world (because there is more dollar outside of US than inside US). This is the greatest thievery of the century, or perhaps even in history of mankind by the way. Well, this "bubble" dropped bitcoin by about ~22%, so not a big deal.IMHO bubbles like this will always happen, however they should get smaller as the BTC economy grows.I like this very much anyway, because i was just planning to buy more BTC and this is the perfect opportunity. Jesus, where did all that aggression come from ?Did i offend you in any way, did I rape your daughter or kill your little kitten ? I mean WTF dude, i just asked a question politely.I think you just lost a possible customer.If i wanted to google it, i would just google it.I didn't want to google it, because i wanted to hear it from you.It was kind of "what did you mean by this exactly" question. Right, i need something more specific - 1 to 3 links maximum.I don't want to struggle going through all of the links.Anyway, it's nanaimogold that should answer the question. You don't have to. Thread from november 15 ?I guess someone just advanced to Necromancer Level 3... 1. What, you call this (drop drom 1.05 to 0 .82) a "bubble" ? Well, if that is a bubble, then i want all bubbles to be like this.2. Usually after fast rise there is a correction. It's starting to rise again, and this time the rise will be more permanent. Will this patch be added to the publicly avaiable source, or will it be a secret/closed source ? I just did, and i didn't find any links to press articles about Government raiding currency exchangers. Correct,  however i meant that it is similiar in the way that you can easily send money worldwide in matter of seconds.Paypal is a soft currency (drawbackable), so that is what differs it from hard currencies such as Bitcoin. Simple.All countries have to hold certain amounts of dollars on their accounts, as they will always need it to buy Oil. Because they are holding it, they need to buy it from time to time, which creates demand for dollar. And demand rises dollar price and keeps it from falling and keeps it in the market.With Euro-based oil exchange, nobody would need dollar at all, so no country would hold it, so nobody (outside USA) would buy it, so it would have a small fraction of today's value. Hyperinflation. the article says:So it seems that PRODUCTION of heroin may be illegal. Production != posession. They can still jail you for producing large amounts.So I was right: there is no country in the world that would allow sex with (< 10 years) underaged children.Which won't help a lot as i already pointed out. Most governments in the world are either too corrupt or simply powerless to stop people from using P2P, so how can they stop them from using Bitcoin ? Death penalty ? That won't pass.And by the way, the governments work too slow to ban Bitcoin before it reaches critical mass. Unless of course they have another argument like "Bitcoin was created for evil", which is the whole point of banning  stuff on this forum. Personally i believe that Bitcoin will gain critical mass in maximum 2 years, after which it will be virtually unstoppable (unless of course some serious technical weakness comes up). Global domination in progress. No worries.With today's technology you can create a Fort Knox to hold your Bitcoins in your home.Truecrypt + Virtual Machines + Linux are the things you need.With these, it is possible to create a digital safe with multi-level encrypted rooms full of mirrors & traps/honeypots which only you can navigate and only you know if they contain anything.... Possibilities are totally endless.----PS. If you want to go "security", drop Windows & Mac instantly. Go Linux or BSD. Corporations such as Microsoft & Apple can not be trusted. Actually, no corporation can be trusted and that is why we have open source software. No. Pedo-porn with young children (<10) is banned practically everywhere.----Also, i don't believe a country which would allow legally producing (not posessing) heroin exists, however i may be wrong there. I think the scenario depends on type of country. For example:- "Full stop": In muslim countries, penalties for using such technology can include stoning a person to death (or cutting a hand, flogging etc), so Bitcoin adoption will seriously slow down or even stop there because people will be seriously afraid of consequences. - "Little or no slowdown": In a "western democracy" type, little will happen. People will keep using Bitcoin as they keep using P2P. Adoption may be slowed down a little- "No effect or speedup": In post-communist democracies, governments make rules, but people break most of them every day. Nobody gives a fuck about law and curruption is very high. So it will have no slowing effect whatsoever. Even a little speedup is possible, because government banning something will create a free advertisement for it. How do i know this ? Because i live in such a country.  Ceiling cat provides:http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998512,00.htmlhttp://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/CLA410A.htmlhttp://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/RRiraqWar.htmlhttp://www.google.pl/search?hl=en&q=saddam+hussein+oil+euro+exchangeSelling oil for dollar and for dollar only is the only thing, that is keeping that currency from hyperinflating. Question is, how long can this trick work ? Also, when will USA will attack Iran ? A month/week before opening of Euro-based oil exchange. Destruction of dollar = destruction of current US economy. They can't let it happen. Finally.Exactly what i had in mind. Not true, or at least not the whole truth.Bitcoin is simultaneously like:1. Cash in the mail2. Bullion mined from the ground3. Physical commodity4. E-currency5. PaypalBitcoin is many things, limiting it only to money transfer is not very accurate IMHO.Clearly this is invention of a genius, to say the true.
Very good point, i didn't think of it this way.So trading illegals also introduces extra risk of police intervention among exchangers ? Interesting, indeed.However, do you have any links to support this ? I would like to read more. Indeed.As long as there will be influx of new people/services/currencies for trading, there is no chance of such strategy to ever work.The price will be instable, but still rising, which is the whole point. Everybody wants tomorrow's bread to be cheaper that today's bread - this is the reason Bitcoin was created in first place - to avoid government thievery by inflation. +1Let's sum it up:1) Ⓑ is not like any other currency, so perhaps it should have a different symbol unlike dollar $ / euro  which have lines through the letter.2) Ⓑ resembles a "coin"3) Ⓑ looks like the logo (as already said)4) Ⓑ ?? ??5) Ⓑ PROFIT !!  Perhaps.However I may be a realist, and that's what scares me. Still, the less bugging, the better for us. It's a better strategy to avoid confrontation to get more strength and battle later.Every single day, Bitcoin is getting more and more powerful. At some point in the future, it will be not only unstoppable, but it won't even be possible to slow it down.----EDIT:Also, every single day, fiat currencies are getting weaker, so delaying confrontation is a winning strategy for Bitcoin. Still, you won't pay for your groceries in Bitcoin then, so mainstream adoption can be severely slowed down. Well i hope you're right since we already have a Marijuana sale thread in the "Market".It won't take long before new threads will start appearing, and then some "authorities" will start bugging our asses about it.Agreed. I also think this may happen. Or write their own clients. They can afford it after all... ++20This is exactly what i was walking about when i argued that allowing of trade of such materials is bad for Bitcoin's publicity. We - anarchist/minarchist/libertarian types don't have any problem with freedom of speech & freedom of trade.But most of "normal people", when they see something like "heroin store", they just run away and don't look back.So selling stuff like drugs/arms/other illegals on this forum will be viewed by general population as proof that "Bitcoin was created for evil" or some other bullshit. This makes it extremely easy for governments to delegalise it, and kill mainstream adoption for next few years/decades.How is possible to fight government while simultaneously putting weapons into his hands ? As i said before, this is a childish strategy (which is no strategy at all actually). #1. Nah, this sucks - i don't want to get a discount for bitcoin, I want to actually BUY something for bitcoin.#2. I don't like this offer for some other reason of which I am not sure , I just can't put my finger on it. As far as i understand, controlling >50% of the network would only allow some double-spending attacks.However if you want to print money, there is technically no possibility of enforcing "government-controlled version of Bitcoin" on everybody.For example, if you make 60% of the network accept new type of blocks, which will allow printing more money, then the remaining 40% of the network will completely reject these blocks, which effectively will make Bitcoin split into 2 networks: the "new" one which is government - controlled, and the "classic" one.Of course, people will choose the "classic" network (nobody want's his money to be stolen by government), and the whole operation will fail. Unless of course govs make that illegal, and Bitcoin will go underground. I think i see few problems with running a fractional reserve bank with bitcoin:1. In the internet era information flows very quickly, so the probability of a bank run is high if people start to suspect something.1a. It's too easy to call the bluff with bitcoin. If people want to take their funds out of the bank, they can do it instantenously. Much easier than with gold. So it is bank run is even more likely.2. To run a fractional reserve bank in any country of the world, you need to cooperate with local authorities or you will be closed down. And since authorities will not understand what Bitcoin is, there may be problems.2a. The central bank would have to have reserves of Bitcoin for fractional - Bitcoin based system to work.... Nah, too complicated, not likely to happen in the closest future. If they will be hoarding for a long time then the effect will be exactly the same as if there were less bitcoins on the market (less goods -> prices rise).However, now if a major player (or mass of minor players) comes to the market wanting to buy a large amount of Bitcoins, the price would totally skyrocket (5x-10x or more). +1 That's right.They may be using a forum not even knowing that it is called "a forum".BTW, Facebook & Youtube have forum systems of their own - comments is kind of a forum (but simplified) too after all. Nothing new, people are working on this forum on Bitcoin - based implementation of DNS:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.0 Yes, but this are mostly the same people who do not know what internet is.If you are using internet, sooner or later you are going to stumble upon a forum. Nice, but i was expecting that.So no surprise here. At the moment, there is really no illegal stuff on the forums, so this is not a problem (yet). Perhaps this poll should be repeated in few months - after/if such goods become a "major issue"... This is definately the best video about bitcoin that has been made so far.It should be posted on the frontpage as explanation, used as an advertisement and posted to YouTube (of course).
They can't block IP addresses outside of their jurisdiction.DNS is the only part left of the internet that is not decentralized. They are using this weakness. You are not even childish.You're mad. This is madness.If you think that Bitcoin is ever going to take off with "I am the fraudulent currency used by mobs, sex-slave traders, drug & arms dealers" label written all over it, then you must be mad.I was hoping to save for my retirement in Bitcoin, now i see that was a stupid idea. OK, I used all the time i had for this discussion, so the same as last time - nobody is convincing anybody here.After this forum is destroyed (which will surely happen the way you are thinking now - no doubt about it), I will start my own with rules against trading prostitution, drugs, arms etc.BTW, I also offered to host a mirror, so i know what I am talking about - mirror is not the same thing as the real deal.Peace. 1. Perhaps in theory this may work, but i want to see it with my own eyes to believe it...Especially after the US government pushes to the "Scandinavian countries" to do something , like they did with Assange.2. Still, this will be extremely bad for the publicity of Bitcoin... it will be like saying "hey, we think trading XXX, YYY and ZZZ is OK, and this is what we created Bitcoin for".You are pushing weapons right into governments' hands... davout:Let me explain in detail why your stance is wrong for the future of Bitcoin.There are many levels on which you can fight for freedom and fuck government. However you are not fighting on the correct level. The levels are:LEVEL 1 "Script Kiddie" : <- You are here- FUUUUUUUUUU GOOOO DIE GOVERNMENT, WE ARE SOOOO GONNA KICK YOUR ASS WITH BITCOIN. BRING IT ON, BITCH ! Attack government in a frontal assault, and lose (governments are prepared for that). Bitcoin stays underground currency for the next 30 years. LEVEL 2 "Patient soldier": <- I am here- Devise a basic strategy. Be cautious, careful, patient. Work slow, don't attract too much attention, popularize bitcoin among various traders & exchangers, and later, before government(s) realizes, there will be no turning back from Bitcoin becoming a world currency.LEVEL 3 "General":- Devise a "masterplan" for popularizing Bitcoin. Have a net of highly organized group of people, who do the promotion of Bitcoin in background in different countries. Have lobbysts, contacts in press & some PR guys. When you gain enough critical mass, attack with full power and consistently march towards absolute victory. 1. Yes, but you are not going to find a host which accepts arms, prostitution AND drugs at one time, because such host does not exist.Every country in the world bans either some drugs OR prostitution OR pornography OR illegal arms OR gambling.2. It is relative but not everything, at one time in any single country. Check #1Yes, it is always in favor of bitcoin becoming an underground currency.But i doubt that everyone here wants it to stay being underground currency for the next 3 decades.Still, technical development does nothing without publicity & "mainstreamness".Very short-sighted statement.- If we ban sale of something, only the freedom of a small group of people will be limited.- If this forum is closed, then EVERYBODY's (who uses Bitcoin) freedom is limited.How come you cannot see that ? Exactly. This is the "mainstream factor".Just to be clear: IRC is not mainstream. It's viewed as a geeky thing by majority of people.If you destroy the main forum, people who don't use IRC or TOR, simply will not use Bitcoin. USA gov censorship in action again, blocking innocent domains:http://torrentfreak.com/u-s-government-shuts-down-84000-websites-by-mistake-110216/ Well, surely not critical. But still, very nice to have So, If IRC is so good (or even better than this forum), then why not trade arms, drugs etc there ? Again: This has nothing to with morals. It is about reputation & mainstream market penetration.Hey, stop. If "no morals", then why not theft, murder ? What's wrong with it ?[/irony]Disagreed. This forum is the central hub of community - meeting place of everything that relates to Bitcoin.If we ever want this currency to go mainstream, we should not let it die.If it becomes TOR-only, market penetration will be serveral times smaller than otherwise, and it can take decades for BTC to become mainstream. Excellent job, well done Sir !Arnold & Chuck Norris approve this:  Well, i noticed some trauma, but still it was an awesome presentation ! If you train some more, you can become the official Bitcoin's PR face (no need to hire another PR guy). + 1I should print this out and put it on the wall over my desk. Well, i think i remember Gavin (or maybe it was somebody else ?) saying some time ago, that this is not a hard limit, and the protocol/client can be upgraded in future versions to support even 128 digits of precision.Isn't this right, Gavin ? No. Nothing like this can or should be done.It's called freedom of speech, bro.What for ? Whole Bitcoin forum is already like that ;P----However, the only reasonable thing that can be done could be banning illegal arms, drugs & explosives trading on this forum, because there is probably no country in the world which will lawfully allow hosting of such content. So letting whole forum die (or making it TOR-only) just to allow few people trade some illegal stuff is IMHO not very smart. Second network... ? Alternative chain...?The Bitcoin is divisible enough, and protocol supports even more divisibility, so what exactly are we discussing ? I thought this matter is already resolved. What for ? I will stay with the main branch, thank you. In the future, large corporations & countries are likely to become such supernodes.And competition between them should guarantee BTC network neutrality & independence.There also will be other super-powerful nodes of hardcore geeks, hackers & "cyber-freedom-fighters", so i don't think that any of the major players will be able to take over most of the network for himself, not for long at least. Wonderful ! Thx.How come i didn't know that ? Awesome news.Debian is probably the most important distro in the Linux world. Now others will follow...We're going mainstream soon, baby ! Oil prices seem much more interesting to me:Look at the mid-2008. See resemblance ?USA economy is largely supported by cheap oil. If the oil ever goes again to over-130 dollars, there is very high probabilty of next crisis because it will suffocate the economy. If it goes over 140, then financial depression is almost inevitable.And the oil is over $100 and still keeps rising... 
Yes, but this option is ultimately annoying, because i can't have both GUI and daemon running.I like GUI better for now, and i can't use it to backup wallet.So i have to shutdown GUI, and start daemon, then backup wallet.... as i said - annoying. Well, i don't trust all of supermarket's products. I simply choose the ones i trust from all avaiable.I certainly know, that they are trying to rip me off with some of them.1. Supermarkets creating currency-associations... isn't this too far-fetched ?2. I would still have to have an account at multiple places/supermarkets since i visit many supermarkets so no, this is far from satisfactory & convenient... 3. The situation when all supermarkets are associated, will simply not happen. That depends how many possible combinations there is...If it is more than number of atoms in the universe, then OK. Otherwise, hmmmm... Not going to work.Now imaging today having to transfer money to supermarket's account, just so you can go shopping & drinking.1. Would you trust such institution with your money (of which not all will be spent) ? I would not.2. This is not convenient at all Well, that would explain different number every time i check it. As far as i understand, the receiving addresses are generated pseudo-randomly based on private keys which are generated when the bitcoin client is first run.So,1. Is it possible (however veeeeery unlikely / low probability) for 2 clients to generate the same adress ?2. If yes, then what will happen if somebody sends bitcoins to that address ? Will both people receive the coins, none of them or some other weird thing will happen ? Is it ?I have been observing it, and it changes in weird ways. I though it's hourly or something... Does it have "backup wallet" option in menu ?This is the thing i'm most missing in the original GUI client. Doesn't matter. If they are not attached to casing, they will loosen because of higher work temperature.You have to place them perfectly straight, or there will be troubles. We have been slashdotted twice & podcasted lately, so the user base may have grown 200% or something in the last 2 months, which can explain that.This chart should look like that if the userbase grows many times faster than new coins are digged out from the ground, which is happening with high probability.Anyway, even if this is a bubble, then that's even better. I can't wait to buy new bitcoins cheap - I'm investing in the long term  If money supply grew 100%, and number of currencies/goods/services offered for it grew 500%, then increase in value is really nothing unexpected.As there is no 100% reliable way to calculate how much stuff is offered for Bitcoin at any time, then the growth could have been 1000% or even 10000%. Very good idea.Cheers. OMG, this is devastating o_O.Three disadvantages:1. When you will be mining like for few months/years, PCIE slots will loosen and get damaged (because the cards are not properly inserted into the slots, they're bent). You will have to buy new motherboard then.2. The slots will loosen even faster, if you make the case stand vertically. You have to put this horizontally to work.3. When you start mining, this setup will overheat with 99,9% probability. This is not for serious solutions.If you want this to really work and cool off, you should consider flooding entire PC (except hard & dvd-drives of course) with oil and adding some pump, as they did here: http://www.metacafe.com/watch/565060/mineral_oil_submerged_computer/(You will probably need to add another oil circuit going through a car radiator if you want this to properly cool off)However the disadvantage of this solution is that you probably can't properly clean the cards after, so warranty void. There are probably very few people with access to Sourceforge account. So this is not a matter of having no leader.The person who has access should take care of it or comission it to somebody else. And here we go again, seems that history will score a loop.80 years ago we had similiar situation. First, everything was backed, and then value was robbed by government from american people (when they took the gold away after great depression).Will the same happen with bitcoin after/if it replaces gold ? Will it be replaced by fiat currency, of which government says it's backed ? I don't think so. Unless they shut down the internet completely to seize control.Lucky us. Contrary to gold, using Bitcoin one can convert his home into digital Fort Knox and store as much value as he wants in it practically without the possibility of thievery ... So i don't see any need to store some bitcoin-based currency. I choose to store the real deal.That would not have been possible before the internet era.This is truly the century of wonders. Bitcoin - the first decentralized Peer2Peer digital gold standard currency. Yep, I remember discussing it several times...Move along, nothing to see here. The new network would have to be totally technologically superior to the current one.That could work, providing another Satoshi-like (japanese ?) genius happens to come along and make a new revolution on top of the current revolution.Otherwise, IMHO unlikely. Well not that i mind it as a Linux user, but still - this creates unnecessary mess. I agree.As long there is no technical weakness of the protocol and there is no reason to lose confidence in the network from the technical side, Bitcoin is most likely to rise forever (of course with spikes and falls).Only the speed of the deflation can vary, and there can be small or medium bubbles which would be caused by overspeculation, but in the long term Bitcoin should always rise - as the number of goods, services & currencies offered for it will rise.The only thing that can really harm bitcoin is some heavy mathematics or a bug, which would break the cryptography used. 
Well, the slave woman actually could happen. It would probably be a prank though.EDIT:Or, if bitcoin becomes #1 World Currency and you become filthy filthy filthy filthy rich, then this could happen for real  Just started Ubuntu on VM and still no bitcoin in repositories after 2 years of the project activity & dynamic development.Is somebody working on officially pushing bitcoin to central/canonical Ubuntu repos ? This could significantly increase BTC popularity.(The same with other distros) Heyy,I just wandered into the sourceforge site, and it seems there is tarball for 3.20 avaiable while there is only 3.19 on the main site ?http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/So which version should I call the newest stable version - the bitcoin.org one or SF one ? Difficulty automatically adjusts to how many mining rigs is out there.This is very well thought through. Sorry to disappoint you, but something like a meteorite which mostly consists of gold, is very very unlikely to ever happen. Perhaps you should try powering one machine using 2 PSUs.However you need to connect the "ground" wire from each of the PSUs together first, as otherwise it won't work.There are easy schematics on the web about how to do that.EDIT:Oh, it seems there is even some vid on youtube explaining how to do that...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BviJjNYsIag What is the soundest FIAT currency ?FIAT cars/car parts i would say  No offence here, but you look pinguish.Shouldn't you be saying "I have been running bitcoin on my Slackware 64bit computer with full-disk encryption for a couple months now." ?  Definately a weird shit. Probably one of the weirdest i have seen yet. What exactly do you mean ? Your question is quite unprecise.I just installed Bitcoin on 10.04 on a Virtual Machine with /home encrypted and yeah, it works fine.Also, i have been using a lot of apps with truecrypt hard drives on my More-Hardcore-Linux-Distribution(tm), and guess what: they all work. Even data recovery utilities work on TC drives exactly the same way as on normal drives. I guess that if Bitcoin becomes more popular, then AMD GPU selling will skyrocket. That would be not for the URI scheme, but just for general use. NO WAI ! I mean who would expect that ? This creates another problem. You have mili-btc, which is easy enough, but what about 0.0001 BTC and 0.00001 BTC ?You mean something like this but kind of - reversed ? It is quite common that some motherboards are buggy and don't support certain PCI / PCIE setups.For example, my motherboard does not support my soundcard, when it is inserted in the first PCI slot.From what you have said I am 95% certain, that the mobo is at fault. You can shut down the cpu-miner completely, because it's not getting you anywhere.If you seriously want to mine, you should invest heavily in AMD GPUs and GPUs only. Radeon 5870 is bare minimum for today to get any meaningful result in mining. But i would go for 5970.Also, if you go 5970, you will probably need to buy new power supply because old one most likely won't be enough. Agreed - not gonna happen.Hackers / security specialists, "true" geeks and people who know WTF they are doing, are never going to step in this controlled corporational shit.Even if >60% majority adopts it, still a lot of people will be using alternative solutions.And for iCrap, there is a cure - much more open Android.Definately. Internet should be a "black anonymous box" into which you send data, and from which you receive data, not knowing what is the identity of the client on the other side of the wire.Only then people can be truly free from government/corporational opression. +1 There is always some bubble, smaller or bigger. Bubbles lies in the nature of speculation.But i guess that it is normal and one trading bitcoin just needs to take the risk into account. You are putting things on my keyboard that i din't write.I never said that i don't care HERE. Perhaps i didn't care in some other thread.PS.SERIOUSLY dude. What is your problem ? Just to remind you - it was you who started insulting me.We could have a polite conversation but no - you like shitfight better.
Well, i had other proposals.Code:1 BTCX0 = 1 BTC1 BTCX1 = 0.1 BTC1 BTCX2 = 0.01 BTC1 BTCX3 = 0.001 BTC1 BTCX4 = 0.0001 BTCor Code:1 BTCA = 0.1 BTC1 BTCB = 0.01 BTC1 BTCC = 0.001 BTC1 BTCD = 0.0001 BTCor Code:1 BTC-0 = 1 BTC1 BTC-1 = 0.1 BTC1 BTC-2 = 0.01 BTC1 BTC-3 = 0.001 BTC1 BTC-4 = 0.0001 BTC...and variations of above.Yeah i agree - it's not very good looking, but I think it's the most intuitive and probably one of the most logical solutions.Using it we can avoid a lot of mess. Because you seem to have said so of course...FYI, i would NEVER EVER put something like this in URL, because just from the looks of it it's scary as hell.FYI-2 i know "something" about security, but i have no need to explain myself to you. Really ? WOW, what a misfire...WM7 will soon be a dying platform, before it even took off...Open Source RLZ, apparently Why so difficult ?It is very easy to set up a 20-line max shell script or PHP script that will do exactly the same - send money to another wallet. I think logical reasoning can help here...Money gives power => More money = more power =>People who have most money are the most powerful =>People who make money, have absolute power =>Conclusion #1: We're most likely ruled by Bankers.Power corrupts => More power corrupts even more =>Absolute power corrupts absolutely =>Conclusion #2: We're most likely ruled by very corrupt people.Conclusion #1 + Conclusion #2 = We are probably ruled by evil and ultimately currupted banker motherfuckers. (Which by the way plays very well with what the american founding fathers said about banks)EDIT:And because 98% of people has even no idea how the banking system works, there has to be some kind of conspiracy to keep the masses from understanding that. You mean like bitcoin-central.net code is open source ?Where is the tarball for download ? Good, i certainly trust you more than bytemaster.But why does it say 13622.05 BTC ? How do we know that the bounty is safe and the person who started this didn't run away ?Bytemaster has a nasty habit of disappearing every few weeks... Doesn't exactly look trustworthy to me.This thread stinks of fraud. Of course.Also: Libertarianism is terrorism.Please wait comfortably in your chair, Though Police will be at your place in few minutes... Yes, but any of the clones will not have the same trust and good publicity as the original one.Less trust = less value.What your saying is very similiar to "What would happen if i mixed some chemicals (or manipulated matter at subatomic level) and produced something that looks, smells like gold and has every other property of gold".Nothing special would happen. Depending of how scarce is the thing you are producing, and how easy is it to produce more, it would have bigger or smaller value. The harder is to produce a thing = the more scarce that thing is == the more value the thing has. Also if it is easy to divise, shape and carry, then it can be used as a currency. This rule works with everything. Coin selection would be an awesome thing.It would allow more privacy for BTC users. So it is possible for a currency to be strong without the need for a lot of goods to be traded with it ? Sirius: I'm an author of a PHP Open Source project dedicated to optimizing sites against "Slashdot/Digg effects" (well it's not directly for that but that's a positive side effect).Contact me if you are interested in speeding up the site dramatically. I was wondering - why is the site and the forum are sooooo sloooooooow.The answer is here - we are being slashdotted. Again.http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/02/10/189246/Online-Only-Currency-BitCoin-Reaches-Dollar-ParityWell, I guess this is both good and bad.  When all bitcoins are mined, then the big miners will probably move out of the market (if the transaction fees won't be large enough).If big GPU/clusters miners move out, then difficulty will drop so much, that you willl be able to generate blocks easily using a single multicore CPU.Not necessarily. If they won't be paying, and big miners exit market, then it will be very easy to generate blocks.I think the market will self-balance automatically, and determine the best transaction fee. I am not sure, but i guess yeah.However that wasn't "clean case", because FRNs were also "legal tender" so that kind of adds purchasing power the the currency. Just out of curiosity.Can a currency be backed mostly or completely by another currency ? Has anything like that ever happened in history ?I don't know, I'm seriously asking a question - this is not sarcasm or anything. I think that smaller or bigger versions of "tulip manias" are happening a lot on Bitcoin market - it's simple matter of overspeculation.But complete destruction of currency is not likely to happen as with the tulips.I mean even if Bitcoin's value drops 10 - fold due to enormously massive overspeculation, it will still be a usable currency. It will still have all the means to be a currency and drop in value is not going to change that. All the technologies to build alternative interwebs already exist: TOR, I2P, GnuNet, OpenVPN, Mesh etc. The only thing needed is the will of people to switch to that alternative. This is exactly what i meant earlier. The approach of a lot of people here is "FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU, GOOO DIEEE GOVERNMENT MOTHAFUCKAS, BGING IT ON BITCHEZ - WE'RE GONNA KICK YOUR DAMN ASS WITH BITCOIN !!!!!!1111oneone".In theory, this is good, because government deserves to get their asses kicked long ago. But in practice this is a "frontal attack using front door" strategy and it won't work, because government is perfectly prepared for a frontal attack. They are good at this.If you want to defeat government, you have to be cautious, careful, patient. Work slow, don't attract too much attention, popularize bitcoin among traders & exchangers, and then, before government(s) realizes, there will be no turning back from Bitcoin becoming a world currency.But it seems a lot of people on this forum are not grown up enough to understand that.
I can't wait until I see this on RedTube... + 1Definately agreed. Well of course not the same - but still very close.- In mainframe model you had  mainframe serving your applications, video to your screen, processor power, etc.- In cloud computing, "mainframe" or "cluster of mainframes" serves either data, applications, or processing power to clients.The general idea is the same, only details changed.One could say that cloud is extension of mainframe-terminal model.So ? Cloud also has central physical cluster serving certain kind of user accounts which are used for different applications.The same thing, only different layer.Yeah... but that is still very close to client-mainframe model. Only this time on a different layer.Mainframe/Terminal = Operational system layerCloud = The same, but 1 or 2 layers higher (application layer, web layer etc)Oh. I wasn't aware of p2p clouds, thx for the info.You are correct, if we're talking about cloud in P2P, then that's new. But cloud in a mainframe or in a cluster of mainframes - we have already seen that. "World government" was never what you would expect from the term.It would be ruled by Rotschilds, Rockefellers & other fraudulent banksters. So there is nothing good in it for us. Unless you want to be bred, controlled & killed at the wish of masters - like cattle.---------Going back to the topic:There is also the problem of technology vs politics, law & social standards. Technology always wins.Simply put, if cloud computing is worse technologically than "current computing", then it will fail. It doesn't matter how hard it will be pushed.Technology is always ahead of politics, law & social changes. P2P succeeded in spite of constants heavy attacks from every direction possible, because it is just the best way to transfer data. You cannot stop technology with political, moral, legislative or other mambo - jambo attacks. The best tech will ultimately prevail. Here are some thoughts for you: "Clouds" is only buzzword, we already had clouds in the 70ties and 80ties of previous century, the only difference is they were called "TERMINAL & MAINFRAME computing" or something like this.Did clouds work ? -- YesDid clouds completely overtake computing ? -- No, it was the other way around - computers started from cloud and evolved into what we have now.Also it's not like every person out there is going to trust middleman to store their data. Of course, 80-95% of users probably wouldn't care, but still there is geek world, which has low tolerance for clouds and low trust in big companies. Computer specialist will never fully trust cloud, because they know what dangers it creates.Also, cloud has many many many disadvantages - there is even no point in explaining them there, this is obvious. This a very good argument. I'm 97% satisfied and 75% convinced. (Contrary to davout's pseudo-arguments which are mostly empty jibberish).However, i'm still worried that adoption will be postponed by few years because of governments delegalizing bitcoin.Anyway, I see that clearly I'm not convincing anybody here today, so i guess everybody have to learn truth the hard way. Just don't say nobody warned you. This is not an ARGUMENT.I'm not whining, I am simply making a discussion.Perhaps this is why I'm continuing to discuss, because i want to convince them they are wrong.This is the point of discussion, am I wrong ?In your dreams perhaps. I remember no such thing.Definately. I usually get mad when people explode with moronic ideas and defend them as if they were absolute truth, exactly as in this thread. For now, most of people in this thread act as children, so what is the difference.I am just making a discussion. Where did i say i owned it ?You clearly don't fuckin' get WTF am I talking about, so STFU Bitch (yes, i can swear too !)Also:1. Nobody is talking about fucking morals. I'm just talking about Bitcoin reputation as a currency. But it seems you're too big fucking moron (oh yes, i can swear !) to get that. I am sorry for you.2. To be clear: I would happily buy Illegal Arms, Drugs etc myself, but again: NOT on this forum. So morals has nothing to do with this.Again, I am NOT implying that fucking government is a bad thing.In fact i fuck the government on every occasion.Of course, again - you're too stupid (i think i'm getting addicted to insulting you. Mmmm that feels gooood) to read with understanding.Nobody is talking about FEAR. I am talking about REPUTATION.Because, in contrary to you, I care if Bitcoin ever goes "large".WOW, this is the first actual valid argument that is not an insult in your whole post.Still, it if will be illegal, then it will be underground currency. And if it will be underground currency, I won't pay for my groceries in it.No, much worse. And it will be TOR-only, which is a problem. Somehow you're too stupid to see that. Why shouldn't it be for masses of people ?I myself want to save for my retirement in bitcoin. I want to some day pay for my groceries in Bitcoin. What is wrong with that ?Of course it has a market in people trading illegal stuff. But not on this forum.If you trade illegals on this forum, it's like you're shouting around : "Hey, bitcoin was created for paying whores, buying drugs, illegal arms and generally fucking the government"Governments cannot shut it down. But they can hold mainstream adoption by making it illegal.And then, you are not going to pay for groceries with Bitcoin. Ever. No, seriously - why are we even discussing this ? I mean these are obvious things...It's like explaining "don't touch the kettle, you will get burned" to the children, OMG...I'm starting to think this is a government provocation to close this forum up faster. ** Illegal stuff should not be traded on this forum. Period **---------Also:Shut up, scammer. That's maybe because there are not many such threads and there is no official policy or set of rules on this forum yet.But it doesn't mean that somebody (Sirius) can't make one.If there is one-two threads, that is not a problem. But when such threads start showing up in hundereds, this may change.Also, pornography is not illegal in most of normal countries. So it's not a big thing. Just wait until people will start selling drugs & arms here. Hell is gonna break loose. That will definately catch the attention of governments - and the website will be closed faster than you can spell "censorship". OMG, this is serious.These are security basics... But I know these disputants, they are not trolls. Who are you talking about ?Oh no - that thing definately does not work on this forum.Because of lack of moderation, everybody here writes about anything in just any topic they want... Offtopic hell. Which is another problem by the way. So whether you want it or not, it will not be mainstream if it is illegal.It will continue being underground currency.Is that what you want ?Nobody is deluding anybody.I am perfectly aware than governments sooner or later will fight bitcoin.But my point is to move that event further in the future. Now, while BTC is in its infancy, we are vulnerable...How is it possible people here don't understand that ? Is it some kind of bitcoin related madness or what ?Does really everybody here wants to buy drugs & get laid so hard that nobody cares if Bitcoin gets destroyed in the process ? Actually I meant the other way around: Bitcoin forum would be TOR-only because of "illegal content" posted on it... (Or becuse of domain seizures)EDIT:But after giving it some thought, i think that "your way" is also possible using propaganda tricks.- First, they prove that Bitcoin was intentionally created for illegal stuff because authors allow that kind of stuff on their forums which clearly shows their intentions.- Second, they will name Bitcoin "the currency of fraudsters, terrorists, illegal arms dealers, drug dealers" etc.- Third, they make Bitcoin illegal- 4. ?? ?? ??- 5. PROFIT !Classic Problem-Reaction-Solution scheme. OK, so whatever. Let everybody trade anything they want in here - let's see how that will work out.Just don't say i haven't warned you. I don't like the idea of having to use TOR to check out main bitcoin website.----FEDs are closing this forum in 5...4...3...2...1... + 1Great point.That's fine. So the hub can have links connecting whole economy (and illegal content).But it does not have to have illegal content itself. At least this gives us some protection against "bitcoin was created to allow trading prostitution, drugs, weapons & other illegal stuff" propaganda attack... I think you're wrong. This forum is not about the "market". It is about bitcoin support.Strength of bitcoin itself (as currency) is more important than having few niche markets on this forum.Get this: Trading illegals on this forum WILL UNDERMINE Bitcoin as a good currency because it creates a weakness which government propaganda can exploit. Sure, but there is no need to make more buzz about it so govs come here faster, right ?They are probably already creating a strategy, and "useful idiots" like you are putting weapons in their hands.If you want Bitcoin never to go mainstream, and become underground-only currency, then go on - trade drugs, prostitution and weapons on this forum. Right, because they bear.Still, i would say that their will to continue "their ways" is bigger than the artificial social barriers keeping them where they are.It's just that Gypsies have had an dynamic/unstable road travel culture since several hundereds of years, and it won't change overnight. They are just used to they old ways, and because of that it is harder for them to get any normal jobs in Poland, because legal jobs in Poland require that you have a fixed registration of residence (they would have to live in one place).Gypsies here are just imcompatibile with recent (last 70 years) social changes, and that creates problems. They have kept their culture, and their culture is no longer compatibile with the modern world - and i think that is the problem. This is the reason they steal, scam and lie - because they cannot find any normal place in modern society. From one point of view - yes, this may be good. But from another point of view - this is a problem.Imagine now that 500.000 people come within next few years and read this topic. Some of them are either stupid, or simply won't read the topic to the end for some reason / just read the first post.Certain percent % of them WILL BE scammmed by this swingler. This is what i wanted to avoid.
This topic should be closed and thrown out into the trash. Too bad this forum is not too well moderated yet... AFAIK we are discussing free trade, not free speech. Are these two the same or what ? I don't believe you even for a second.Very bad case of false start (or rather: Fail start).Go scam people on other forums, you are going to have a hard time finding many fools here. You apparently don't get why do we want to ban selling illegal stuff on this forum. Let me explain this to you.This forum was founded by bitcoin author, or somebody closely related to him. So if owners of this forum allow prostitution, drugs, pornography etc to be traded here, then governments/courts will view this as clear proof that Bitcoin was designed with thought of doing illegal stuff.Next step - bitcoin.org domain will be seized as illegal, and its creators will be called "drug dealers", "pimps" or "terrorists". Let's not make it too easy for governments to shut us down. Wrong. The other way around.Dude. There is no rule which forbids Gypsies from having legal occupations in Poland. Gypsies just are like this (scamming, thieving, begging etc), and they are doing it for centuries. It didn't start yesterday.I am sorry, but their reputation is VERY well deserved across hundereds of years.If they want to fix this, they should start to behave according to cultures of the countries they occupy. If you want a really professional cooling, you should start building something like this:http://www.pugetsystems.com/submerged.phphttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtufuXLvOokEasiest to maintain, easy to cool (just make a loop with a pump and add a radiator from a car to it).I planned to do something like this myself, if only i had the cash. Of course this is easily solvable using GPUs. So not a bottleneck anymore i guess. Sure, but in my situation believing in racism would be simply idiotic, since I am subjected to racism myself.I know it hurts, i know what racism is and i know what racism is not.Still, that does not prove anything. You may be an exception from the rule.Also while visiting London, i noticed that when Gypsies come to richer countries, they more often start having legal occupations (i personally rented room from a Gypsie in London). Perhaps they just treat my country as a temporary stop on the way to western countries, who knows.And no matter how long we discuss here, 99% gypsies in my country (Poland) still don't have a legal occupation, and this is an undisputable fact. We shouldn't disagree since I'm talkiing about the same thing, just using different words. Well, perhaps I'm not making myself clear enough. Well said, Sir.Promoting prostitution, drugs & other illegal buisnesses should be totally banned on this forum.Let's focus on creating a legit, stable currency, and leave other things to other places. I like Gavin's idea much better than some proprietary PDF certificate which seems to be some sort of weirdness, which people will probably perceive as even more geeky than bitcoin. Theoretically cool idea, however this could create big, government-related problems for the forum owner if somebody starts to sell prostitution, drugs or other stuff there.So the safest place for such thing is probably TOR. I do not despise any "group", so your assumption is invalid. I don't like certain "traditions".There is no point in despising a group of people, since a) not everybody in a group is like the rest of the groupb) people can change their culture - if they want to of courseYou're not listening. I'am not wishing for anybody or any group to be "rounded up" anywhere anytime.I'm just making an observation. Gypsies JUST DON"T WORK LEGALLY here. IT SIMPLY ALMOST DOES NOT HAPPEN. Deal with it.They just don't integrate at all. They beg, steal, lie, scam 99,9% of the time. And i don't need any statistics to confirm that. Just ask **anybody** in my country. Go make a street survey and ask people if they have seen legally working gypsie. You will be surprised (or not).Perhaps there is a way to fix their culture, but at the moment I have no ideas.Also, some gypsies leave their culture and live like a "normal people", but VAST majority do not. It's actually quite absurd to call me racist, because I myself am not white and in my country i have suffered a lot because of racism. But of course you cannot know that so it is not your fault.I understand perfectly what racism is and what it is not, because i have felt it on my own skin.What I am saying is that it does **not** matter what **RACE** gypsies are. It's just their culture which makes them do illegal stuff.In my 30-year long life i have almost NEVER seen a gypsie having a legal occupation in my country, and believe me - there are a lot of gypsies here.99,9% gypsies i know are either professional beggers, thiefs or scammers. In my whole life **MAYBE** i have seen **ONE** gypsie working legally somewhere some time ago, but i don't remember correctly now. So just imagine how many of them have illegal occupations comparing to legal ones. Nice try, but i don't believe this even for a second.----PS. If any of you is careless enough to actually go to Romania or something, I strongly advise against it...Romania is full of gypsies. If this is a real scammer from Romania, there is 99,999% probability that you will get robbed or kidnapped if you go there...Believe me, i live in a country where there is a lot of gypsies, and they usually engage in such illegal stuff. Well actually, I'm Polish.I know a lot of "normal" people, and most of them doesn't know said math prefixes.Well, this is a valid point. Still, i think my way is more intuitive. Bitcoin is a difficult, geeky thing enough itself, and now you want to tech people mathematic notations ?This is madness. It will take people ages to learn that (i mean majority of "normal" people).Notation proposed by me is better simply because it is more intuitive by orders of magnitude than "mili", "micro", "nano" and such (which "normal", non-geeky people do not know). These are simply too "geeky" to be accepted & easily understood by general population.Also AFAIK, these notations were never used in currency. Currencies have their own names for everything. So should bitcoin.This is a simple matter:If you want to make Bitcoin difficult - use the metrics notation.If you want to make Bitcoin easily understandable & intiutive - use my (or similiar) notation.Go on - ask your mother what "micro", "nano" and "mili" means. I wonder if she knows. A "workable default" will only work for some time. And looking and current rally, not very long time.It would be better to make an algorithm instead. Perhaps one based on weighed average trade size. If you have nothing to hide and you're 100% real, then you simply show what you have. It is that simple. If US really had the gold, they would show it and allow experts to scan it, because that would strengthten te belief in US gov & US power in other nations. But they are not doing it for decades, which means they have something to hide.Also, there is simply no country in the world with enough balls to call the bluff on US. Yeah, todays encryption capabilities can make your home a digital Fort Knox, so why use banks ?This is exactly the reason why bitcoin is so awesome.
Not a bad idea, but this value cannot be static.It should be adjusted automatically somehow, because otherwise fees will be too high as soon as bitcoin gains more value.So i guess that if you can propose a very good algorithm for determining what the minimum fee should be, then this idea could have sense. There seems to be a new resistance forming at 0.7.Volumes stays high. Going back to the topic - it seems that we will be reaching parity soon, so perhaps default maximum decimal places should be changed to 0.001 BTC.Also, I propose that the number of decimal places could be set somewhere in the GUI application for convenience. I already proposed something like this before, but easier to read, as "normal" people don't know the mathematics/physics prefixes.1 BTC0 = 1 BTC1 BTC1 = 0.1 BTC1 BTC2 = 0.01 BTC1 BTC3 = 0.001 BTC1 BTC4 = 0.0001 BTCOr with some adjustments:1 BTX0 = 1 BTC1 BTX1 = 0.1 BTC1 BTX2 = 0.01 BTCOr:1 BTC-0 = 1 BTC1 BTC-1 = 0.1 BTC1 BTC-2 = 0.01 BTCOr:1 BT0 = 1 BTC1 BT1 = 0.1 BTC1 BT2 = 0.01 BTCOr something like that. What do you mean ? This is the basic lesson about inflation. The more gold is there in the circulation (fake or not), the less every piece of gold is worth.Making fake gold is the same way of stealing money from people owning gold as printing dollar is a way to steal value from people owning dollar.Inflation == Tax. Making fake gold = inflation = tax. It "doesn't make sense", because simply, there is a strong fetor of fraud in gold matters from a long time...Of course, US and UK will never allow this news to be published in mainstream media, because that would destroy their reputation.Well, i hope that Wikileaks gets them. So i guess gold will be backed by Bitcoin some day after all...http://www.daily.pk/fake-gold-bars-in-bank-of-england-and-fort-knox-14477/This also would explain too highlow prices of gold.They are not doing that since yesterday, it was probably going on for decades... On MTGOX, we almost hit 1 USD = 1 BTC today on MTGOX, but that was probably overspeculation.But i'm thinking we're going to hit parity soon. Exactly my thinking. But once the genie is out of the bottle, you cannot put it back.Now we just wait and see how will the future unfold. Somehow, I'm seeing tremendous increase of popularity of forest sightseeing So here we go, first Bitcoin drug store.We're going into deep water faster than i thought then.I wonder how long will it take for govs to start investigating Bitcoin. Right, i didn't think this through. So i was talking like it wasn't done, and it worked all the time... Stupid me.Closing thread. I just had another revelation:Signing binaries by satoshi usign PGP is no solution at all. Why ? Because when Satoshi's public PGP key will be avaiable over HTTP, not HTTPS, governments/ISPs still will be able to change it on the fly using their proxies/filters.This is a chicken-egg problem.  That's the problem right there. They should be.So if they aren't yet, wouldn't it be like a 5 minute job for site admin to add one static HTTPS page with signatures included ?I mean I'm proposing a quick working fix, and later when Satoshi signs all binaries himself, this will no longer be needed. There are plugins for firefox which alert you every time a certificate changes, just like in SSH.https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/certificate-patrol/And even if you're not using plugins, my proposition is much better than nothing, isn't it ? I have another proposition:There should be a site, like https://www.bitcoin.org/signatures where there are SHA1/MD5/SHA256 signatures of every file that is avaiable for download on bitcoin.org.This way, there will be a 100% cracker-resistant way to know that one is downloading unmodified/unhacked files.For now, the only way to know we have a "clean" bitcoin is to download the source, pull changes from github and review them yourself, which is probably not very good for starters/noobs.After all, latest events concerning Facebook & Tunisia government, show that it's not very hard to imagine governments or ISPs modifying bitcoin binaries to place trojan horses in them.What do you think ? This shouldn't be verry hard to do - i mean how hard it is to setup a single static HTML page on HTTPS ? This is a very similiar situation to a Gold mining rush, and i think this is a good thing because it confirms that bitcoin is a bullion just like gold, not some completely virtual numbers.Bitcoin is the first bullion which is not physical, and i think that's ultimately cool. Because Bitcoin, contrary to other currencies is deflationary, people will choose it for saving money rather than buying stuff.So it is somewhat normal that there are mostly exchange services. Who would want to spend a currency which is doomed to rise in the long term ?I think however that goods trade services are coming to spring up soon. We forget about one thing.It does not have to be profittable at all.It can be used by FEDs/Governments to attack bitcoin. Millions of dollars is not much when it comes to eleminate the threat to all known fiat currencies. Banksters will be mad about this. And they will surely try everything - It's only matter of time.---------Also, i see on weakness in the proposed attack scenario. Bitcoin clients by default only connect to every 1 of 16 bitcoin nodes IPs (or was it 1/8 ?). So if I am correct, the attacker would also have to set up a lot of different bitcoin clients in different IP ranges to successfuly broadcast his fake double spent transactions. Otherwise, when using nodes in a small IP range, the double spent transactions will be rejected by most honest nodes (which will not connect to many nodes in the small IP range, and choose some other nodes instead), thus rejected by the whole network. I don't know if I am reasoning correctly here, somebody correct me if not. It is utter nonsense. It looks that the guy doesn't understand how the network works when he says about "stealing" BTC, and getting 5Million BTC... It is not possible in a reasonable amount of time.
Hmmm let me think....   Government(s) and FEDs ? Of course. If it wouldn't, i would say something. Yes, the protocol still supports it, but the default client does not create such transactions. So it is not the "normal use" of Bitcoin to store binary data in it. Case closed. Well, maybe not completely pointless, but much less useful than i thought, and certainly not much more anonymous. OK, this seems nice and polished. But i have one, very important question:Where do you get your random number / random number seeds ?When it comes to computers, all "random" numbers are really only pseudo-random. And proper randomness factor / entropy is everything when it comes to online casinos.Just look what one of the companies did to get REAL random numbers: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n8LNxGbZbsPerhaps you should consider getting real random seeds from somewhere. Otherwise i don't think the game will be really fair.----BTW, do you know that there are specialized companies whose only occupation is generating random numbers and selling them ? It doesn't matter anymore if you put kiddie porn in chain or not.Because of the default client now does not support any non-standard transactions (isStandard() function), and bitcoin is only specifically advertised & designed as currency by its creators, this case will be classified by courts the same as using a phone for coordinating a bank robbery would be.The telephone operator cannot be held responsible for actions of a criminal which used the phone to do some evil. That is a fair point, why didn't i think of it ?Encryption is pointless, because when an attacker can control enough bitcoin nodes, SSL won't help at all... Simple. So that nobody knows what IP were these transactions created by.And SSH-like connection will be almost exactly the same as a SSL-like connection, but without central certificate authorities. Of course some mechanism of reading fingerprints from a HTTPS site could also be implemented, so people could create "semi-certificate authorities" which would be simply a list of node IP's with their fingerprints. I propose something that has been discussed many times on the forums - implementing connection encryption to the bitcoin protocol.Details: - Like SSH, people will be able to connect to each other securely, using cryptographic keys / identities they need to exchange first.- As in SSH, each host will generate its fingerprint, and set of private/public keys. So nodes connecting will be able to verify each other- Some nodes (like banks) will be able to publish their keys/fingerprints somewhere (like on their site), so that everybody can confirm who they are when connecting to their bitcoin clients- When key/fingerprint of remote node changes, user will be warned & asked if he wants to connect anyway (like in SSH).- To make things easier, one could use openssl library present in every major operating system to implement this.Possible benefits:- Possibility of having almost 100% anonymity for each node. (if some random traffic generator will be also implemented) A third party no longer will be able to tell who is who and which transaction is which by sniffing the traffic coming in/out of a node.- Real security & more anonymity when connecting through TOR (right now the exit nodes can easily sniff/intercept all traffic, so using bitcoin on TOR is somewhat dangerous).- Eleminate man-in-the-middle attacks.- People will be able to create "semi-certificate authorities", which will store each node's fingerprints and show them publicly, so nodes of the network can be verified.- Clients (like banks) could choose to connect only to trusted, SSL-verified nodes, and ignore the rest.Possible disadvantages:- Possibility of centralization of the network ? Everybody will dance as long as they are not exhausted enough to die.There is a real mental illness that makes you do that actually, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_mania I think the improvement would be that wallet could be completely encrypted, so to send or accept any transactions, one would have to give a password.Still, that would not protect against keylogger attacks. Yeah - as i said - breaking into a fully patched desktop Linux with software only from signed repos using a 0-day is itself highly unlikely.+ Add Noscript/Flashblock = Very highly unlikely (A critical 0-day vulnerabilities which do not require javascripts/canvas/html5/iframes/advanced stuff are VERY rare)+ Add Virtual Machine = Practically impossible I know what You mean. I can still either run bitcoin as a different user, or better: run bitcoin in an encrypted virtual machine.This practically takes the risk of any hack down to zero.That attacker would have to 0) Find a MASSIVE way to attack everybody at once before the 0-day is detected (not an easy thing to do).1) Crack my web browser (with Noscrtipt/Flashblock/Adblock installed, so it is not an easy task either)2) Find the correct virtual machine3) Hack into the virtual machine, breaking it's security also.I **seriously doubt** that any 0-day will ever be able to do that.And about Stuxnet: It ran on Windows. I don't put "windows" and "security" in one sentence. Sorry, i just got used to the fact that on every other forum this is viewed as spam.My bad. I don't think this is much of a problem.For example, mastercard has maximum capacity of 140 million transactions per hour. Which makes 38.888 transactions per second.38.888 transactions per second * 250 bytes = 9722000 bytes = ~77,77Mbit. (Though on average, Mastercard does only 22 billion transactions a year, which makes about 2,5 million a hour, and ~700 a second, so there are probably only spikes with high number of transactions, and the rest is much lower)So anybody with 100Mbit broadband/fiber will be fine. Just buy a powerful 6-or-more cores computer, and you probably will be able to easily calculate everything without much strain.But by the time Bitcoin will be so popular to process that many transactions, internet connections around the world will be easily 100-200% faster than currently, so no problem there. Also, you can always buy a decidated hosting connected to 1Gbit pipe (which is less expensive that you would imagine), and You're cool. Doesn't I2P work simply out of the box as it is a java app ?I remember setting it up some time ago, and i could swear it worked without any configuration.I lost interest in it, as it is meant to be a closed network of nodes, unlike TOR, which interferes with the "normal" internet by default. Watched 2 episodes already. Not much propaganda there (or at least not more than in usual US movies). The problem with Chineese is that they may get a bullet in their head for doing something the government doesn't like.They don't fuck around with dissidents in China like they do in democracies. If they even suspect that you're doing something nasty, you get sent to labor camp or worse. http://www.biddingpond.com/No, really - WTF. Will they pay for my treatments if i get eye cancer ? Ok... so basically you're advertising your blog on the forum for free.Great.
It will never be as scarce as Bitcoin. Think logically: You have two currencies which are identical with exception that one has more value which is expected to rise faster. What will people choose ?You mean like allowing each node to print as much money as it wants ?Wouldn't this be a Zimbabwe-style disaster ?-- No, seriously. Why the hell would i want my savings to lose value ?.Saving with hard currency is so easy. No need to buy physical things. You just keep money and they make profit. Isn't this beautiful ? The fundamentary flaw of this timecoin idea is that it is no different from "normal" currencies.What makes bitcoin so special is that it is a "gold standard" currency - it is also a commodity, contrary to Timecoin, which will get inflated forever.Bitcoin is "physical" in a way, because it behaves similarly to physical bullion - after you mine all of it from the ground, it's gone. Timecoin is not like this.Essentially, it's scarcity that creates value. Abundance destroys value.----EDIT:So what You're actually proposing here, is to create a clone of Bitcoin, which has all the properties of Bitcoin, except it has less value than Bitcoin by design. People will never go for this. Mwhahahahahahaha.You just made my day.  Can you post some more details ?EDIT:Never mind, found it out myself: This is really a brilliant invention in so many ways.Unfortunately, most people will only after realize it after the revolution is over - and then Satoshi will be publicly recognized as a genius.We're really lucky to jump on this bandwagon while it's still in its infancy. Perhaps some day we will be telling your children - "I was **there** during the dawn of economic revolution ! Nobody knew then what is to come. But i was there, between the brave bunch of people who created the world of the future". As was already said, current ATI cards will be totally superior over any console.It's almost 3 Tflops after all... No console today can offer this computational power. And the price/power ratio is extremely good (for ATI) as well. Which one ? Well, You have been warned. You can't sue me for any permanent brain damage anymore.I myself suspect this may contain some subliminal messages - I see no other explanation of this hypnotic power. This is completely doable using existing technologies in a reasonable time - you could create a custom Linux distro with specialized scripts & QoS software preinstalled. All the needed software already exists. Shoudln't be very difficult for an average Linux-geek.Once bitcoin becomes mainstream, i guess we're going to see many of these. Actually, that is no longer true. Large corporations have become so powerful, they can kill you if they don't like you, and they get away with it:http://killercoke.org/For now this usually happens in small third world countries, where law is weak and governments are corrupt. But it won't be like this forever. Also, you should probably watch/play some Resident Evil. Well, you've got a point here.I guess that 1) There is still possibility of running Bitcoin as a different user, or 2) Perhaps everybody should keep their bitcoins on an small, specialized system which is not directly connected to internet (can only be accessed over SSH from your home). That would be a kind of "personal digital safe".I think that once Bitcoin becomes really popular, somebody may start producing/selling such "digital personal safes" from 2) and advertise them around bitcoiners. BTW:Did Satoshi contribute anything to bitcoin code lately ? You know, there are already rumors on the forum that he is dead or whatever * ShadowOfHarbringer is too lazy to check himself. Incorrect.Noscript protects against almost ALL possible vulnerabilities, because it disables simply everything that can cause security problems (Javascript, JAVA, Iframes, HTML5 storage and such).I dare you to show me a 0-day vulnerabitilty that will still work after i install Noscript.Also, i wouldn't call firefox a buggy/insecure browser. It is quite secure, because vulnerabilities are very quickly (48 hours AFAIK) fixed. This is the power of open source. I think that we're not too late. All the technologies needed are already there (P2P, Bitcoin, TOR, I2P, Proxy, OpenVPN etc).It is already possible.  The internet could already become one giant gray box, to which you send data and from which you receive data, not knownig where that data come from, and where are the data coming to. But that of course depends on the people and their will to do it. The question is - will the people follow this path ? I certainly hope so, because IMHO the only other way out of the current situation is either a Global Totalitarian Government or war. I sure would pick anonymity & freedom. 1. Use Noscript, Adblock, Flashblock2. Run bitcoin with a different user (making this default option in bitcoin client shouldn't be very difficult, at least in Linux/UNIX), perhaps in chroot.Problem solved. Coming next: - Is Satoshi a zombie ?- Is Satoshi on crack ?- Is Satoshi a super-intelligent animal ?- Is Satoshi a superhero ?- Is Satoshi lesbian ?- Is Satoshi an A.I. ? This is all cool & dandy, but that link no longer works for me. This is one of the stupidest thread of the century. That was speculation. We're back to ~0,33. Personally i simply double-backup my whole partition every day (weird RAID configuration).Also, i backup my wallet on a pendrive every longer period of time.
The current prices are rising constantly high even on a high trade volume. So I wouldn't say this is a bubble.Mtgox BTC/USD is back to ~3,30 currently. I think this is the "normal" price, 0,40 was speculation. Every hacker loves bitcoin. Bitcoin is the ultimate hacker & cyberpunk dream. http://www.kimsufi.pl/ks/Super-cheap dedicated hosting.One core/250GB/2GB/100Mbit starts from about 20 EUR / Month.And yes, it is quite stable/reliable, I'm already using it for more than a year.Here is the french page - it's very alike in matter of pricing & selection:http://www.kimsufi.com/ks/There is an UK site too, but it is little more expensive. Agreed [Common folk MODE]What da hell are ya talkin' 'bout man ?If that was an insult, you're getting your ass kicked today.[/Common folk MODE] If i wanted to cover bitcoin in one sentence, then i would say "Bitcoin is the first virtual, electronic bullion". Hey, nobody is in a hurry here.I was just asking if You can do it at all. I'm not saying about hosting software, I'm saying about a Desktop computer with newest version of Firefox installed.And contrary to some hostings which use such install scripts installing unstable & unsecure shit (by the way, what hosting companies are these ? i will know what to avoid - thx), standard desktops are not so suspectible to infections - of course only if you install software from signed repos and keep updated.That's because "standard desktops" do not serve anything to outgoing world as hostings do. If you're using Linux for bitcoin & only install software from signed repositories & keep system up to date, then probability of infection is almost unexistant.You should be more worried if You're using Windows however. I didn't say that it wouldn't work. I just said it is retarded  This is probably the most retarded idea of the century.You can now claim the prize:http://www.hare-hill.co.uk/pics/bunnies/previous%20bunnies/Pancake%20bunny.jpg (bunny included). Can you provide some historial & economical context ? "Was horrible" doesn't say much. Hey, I like the idea ! Sounds definately better than the current system.Oh, wait... OK, so point out these parts, i am interested what was lies and what was the truth.I myself noticed one inexactness, but i wouldn't call it a lie. I wouldn't call it lies - that would be an overstatement. It is just not very precise.The movie itself is just adjusted so that the masses can understand how the system works without too much thinking, and it does that well. For the ones who want details, they can study Wikipedia, books, or watch other movies.Money as debt is better though. But i have also met people who said that "money as debt is lies" because "it is more complicated than that". But in it's core, both Money as debt and AMERICAN DREAM are right. Central banks (and generally banks in today's sense) are here to steal from us and make us slaves. As simple as that. I seriously doubt that 10% of gold/silver/platinum bullion is lost every year...Once people understand that bitcoin is a hard money & a commodity, they will protect it with their lives, the same as they do with normal bullion. Therefore, i think that 10% may be probable for the first few years of bitcoin adoption, and when masses understand the power of bitcoin, the loses will fall to 3% or less.----EDIT:Also, new, better clients will be created with built-in multiple automatic wallet backups & data redundancy (or it will be implemented in the default client). So the losing of a wallet will become less common. On Linux/UNIX there are network filesystems such as NFS and CODA, which can give you multiple backups on many servers at once. Everything everywhere cannot just go "boom" all in the same time.Not saying about ZFS, SAN/RAID disk arrays, and lots of other technologies which give you multiple data redundancy. You can have as many backup servers as you want... possibilities are endless. Anyway, this is not really a problem, because modern banks all use electronic currencies already, and if their computer systems failed, people would lose money the same way as they would lose bitcoins... OK, actually we're both right, this discussion is pointless.How did this start ? Ah, i said that bitcoins are "backed". Well, wrong choice of words. I should have said that they are valued at their market price like a commodity.Mea culpa  OK, but gold is not also backed by anything itself.So what ?For thousands of years the only reason people wanted gold was because it was shiny, cool & trendy (I'm not talking about modern times when gold is used in electronics and so).So if bitcoin becomes cool & trendy like gold, it can easily become the commodity everyone wants itself. It has an inherent value.Also, if somebody finds another use for bitcoins (the same as gold is used for electronics today), then it will have all the properties of a commodity (except that you can't touch a Bitcoin). This is a wrong way of thinking. Bitcoins cannot be redeemed, because they are not a fiat currency or I-OWE-YOU notes. They are more like a commodity, a bullion. They are almost physical, except that You cannot touch them or hold them.What you are asking me to do is not to "redeem" bitcoins for something. You are asking me to either put the mined gold back to the ground [EDIT: or convert it to power, manhours & devices used to extract it]. But what would be the point of that ?--EDIT: To be exact, you cannot put the mined gold back to the ground in precisely the same way it was previously stored, atom-by-atom. It is impossible with current technology. The same with bitcoins. Once you mine the bitcoin from the "ground", you cannot put it back in exactly the same way it was stored there previously. Also, you can't convert the mined gold back to the electricity, fuels & manpower used to extract it - the same as with bitcoin.--EDIT2:The more i think about this, the more i see how incredible invention bitcoin is. Satoshi & whoever invented the idea of electronic commodity based on hashes are undoubtedly geniuses. I would rather pay money to the site if they publish a bitcoin address or paypal or something themselves. I do not want to send money to someone random spotted on forums.
WOW, so now they have cut away the top of the pyramid, and they call it "a trapezoid" ?HahahahahaGood, good. This is a very nice idea. Though it will only work if you have money to donate...  So is BitDNS officially dead ?Is somebody doing anything at all in here ? Was that the first poll in Your life or what ?  Before i opened the topic i was thinking that CIA is officially tracking bitcoin repositories activity, and when i read the topic i was like "wtf is going on here".OP got me scared. I think i know why we're having this discussion.It's because bitcoin is a completely new invention - nothing like this has ever been done before, so no comparison at all to anything known. Our minds get lost because this is a completely new situation. I believe that bitcoin is not backed nor it is non-backed. It's somewhere in between. Still better than not backed at all. Not really. Not in this country...If you stop paying, you go to jail. Closed loop. + 1.It would be really nice if the OP created a poll btw. OMG, this is probably the most awesome thing i have seen in a year.Great job !BTW,I wonder why don't they have a donate button. I won't buy a DVD, but i can still donate a small amount. Well, then You better check this out:http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gerald+celente&aq=fhttp://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=peter+schiff&aq=fOnes of the very very few economists who have successfully forecasted the financial disaster.Their current predictions are not very comforting either... Not right now, but in the future, probably. So the garden is not in Poland ?Have I totaly misunderstood something ? Well, you're right. It's not exactly "backed". It's more like soft-backed, or half-backed (not half-baked).It's not backed in something physical, but every coin is linked to something intellectual, as a solution to some mathematical formula. It's not physical, but better than nothing.Certainly it's better than just bits on some bank's server. 1. QQ is not a hard-backed currency.2. Bitcoin is  backed by intellectual assets such as solutions to complex mathematical problems. It has an inherent value.3. China issues this.  I do not want anything to do with China government which surelly will control that currency (if it doesn't already).4. It is ultra-inferior when comparing to Bitcoin in almost every other way. That makes me wonder.... Why would you need biometric identification in a kitchen ? Haven't i heard this somewhere ?What is the difference between this and loom ?https://loom.cc/ Poland you say ? What city are you from ?/Polska mówisz ? Z jakiego miasta jesteście ? Coming next: Bounty for big, round, bitcoin logo-shaped costume for the brave one. So how does this work, exactly ? Always happy to help.
BTW,I forgot to add that my horse is amazing.http://www.weebls-stuff.com/songs/Amazing+Horse/(Warning: this stuff can melt your brain, you're opening this link on your own responsibility.) Yes, this is also partially what i meant. The less gold is in the ground, the more difficult it is to mine some gold out of it, as it requires more search, more work, more resources. This is not entirely true. Bitcoins also have an inherent intelectual value, which is a solution to a complex mathematical problem.Of course, that value is probably not very big, but still.Also, bitcoins behave like gold when you want to obtain them. You need to mine them using energy & resources, and the more people is out there mining, the less probability exists you will be the lucky one. Exactly the same as gold: the less gold there is on earth, the more difficult mining becomes, as the "easiest" gold is always mined first and the more difficult one is mined later requiring more resources. Bitcoin is like scarce bullion in many ways... Hahahahaha I'm really lovin' this forum  FYI, it is present in many of current linux distros' repositories as well.I use Gentoo and i have this in repo. More like conflict of Human vs Machine.When comes to security, social techniques are more effective than strictly computer ones. There is already Linux, open source command-line software for just this:http://steghide.sourceforge.net/Checked, it works. You can use it under windows with cygwin.Also, it encrypts the data with a password, so you are fully protected. Human is almost always the weakest link. Then people using bitcoin will simply switch to Linux, or have a separate Linux partition just for bitcoin.If you use Linux only with software from signed repositories, it is virtually impossible to catch a virus.And that is.... why exactly ?Having any better ideas, or just empty words ?Of course, bitcoin will not exist in its current form forever. As time goes on, it will evolve. You just went totally offtopic with this man. The movie itself is not bad, but the voice used is terrible.Also, more details about the protocol could be helpful. Damn, i really hate this as it is very common in my country.You come to them asking for help, and you get your ass kicked instead. I join the question. This is only part of the story.Gold can be largely overspeculated, price spikes are likely, so it is not the best investment. Other bullions are safer. I did not say "stop quoting at all". Just quote OVER the message, not UNDER it. Look at your post, now back at mine.Now back at your post, now back at mine.Sadly, your post isn't mine, but if you stopped bloody quoting under the message, it could be like mine.Is that so difficult ?(Also, I am on a horse) From what you are saying, it clearly looks like it was not fiasco. Government was simply more powerful and destroyed it. It is not a fiasco of currency itself. If you have army big enough, You can destroy just any non-bulion centralized currency by simply invading the country which issues the currency.** Also, please stop quoting below messages. It is annoying as hell. ** This is not usenet or email.  E-gold **FIASCO** ?Check this out:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-GoldIf by "fiasco" you mean being raided by government, then fiasco it is, indeed.Government really hates competition. There is a way, the question is if sirius has time or will to do it. Right, terribly bad poll. What if somebody wants to store all in BTC ? Or 50 % ? Well... *block* size is relevant for 99,9% men and 75%+ women. The rest are either eunuchs or lesbians.
Do you mean sex for bitcoins or p0rn for bitcoins ? There is a difference. Bitcoin solves multiple problems. It is quite a reVolutionary invention.1. Problem of government breaking down money using printing them or manipulating them in other way.2. Problem of centralization - too much power corrupts people too much. In bitcoin, that is not a problem, as there is no central authority.3. Problem of single point of failure - bitcoin will work as long as internet will work. Destruction of multiple banks or data centres will not bring bitcoin down.4. Problem of anonymous transactions (when used properly).5. Problem of divisibility: You can divide bitcoins up to .8 decimal point, like 0.00000001 bitcoins. Actually the protocol allows dividing even to smaller pieces.6. Problem of creating gold standard currency which can be easily sent over the internet.7. Problem of creating an electronic virtual currency, that would not be virtual and would be a "hard" currency. Each Bitcoin has an inherent intelectual value, because it holds a solution to complex mathematical problem. And REAL work needs to be input to produce a bitcoin, just like you need real work to mine gold out of ground.I don't think you are understanding the conception of bitcoin properly. If you would, you would also know that bitcoin can be quite anonymous when used properly.Why would there be any paper trail ?1. Somebody buys bitcoins somewhere - probably on some exchange or market using credit card. Trail starts.2. It sends them to your one-time generated anonymous bitcoin address (yes, Bitcoin supports it) , trail breaks. So how does the trail pinpoint you if nobody knows that the final address belongs to you ?  Well she probably has SOME skills...  Yeah but i wonder why does it say that transaction size is 1K if currently one transaction takes averagely ~275 bytes of storage ?Does it take more bandwidth than storage or what ? OMG, this is just.... not right.I mean... what would Satoshi say ?  Of course, and that is a kind of Steganography, which i already pointed out.Steganography = hiding additional information in seemingly "standard" data, such as music, video, images, and now - bitcoin.But such a transaction is a standard transaction, which is no problem at all because it does not bloat the blockchain with extra data. The problem which i was talking about is people trying to push extra non-currency data into the block chain and mainstream client, making every transaction bigger, which would increase storage and bandwidth requirements. We're not understanding each other.I already pointed it out in when i was talking about Steganography. You cannot stop people from using bitcoin for other means than currency - because there is steganography, but you can limit it using currency fees and isStandard().Anyway as i said, the less unnecessary data is in the chain, the better. More junk = greater bandwidth/storage requirements. And in case of bitcoin goes into micro-payments buisness, this will become a problem quickly. Yes, there is a way. Only put necessary information in the chain. Keep currency-unrelated stuff out, and it will be fine.1. There is a mechanism already implemented to do that. Transaction fees. If there are too many transactions, per transaction fees my kick in automatically. However i don't know how does that  exactly work.2. This cannot be completely stopped, but that is not a problem until bloat is kept out of official chain. As long as the tansactions are "standard", but hold some steganographic information in them, it's OK.You overslept. That is exactly what version 0.3.18 is doing using isStandard() function. It filters out all non-currency transactions unless I am not misunderstanding something. Agreed, this is a small paradox/loop, but it works. My concern is putting unnecessary bloat in bitcoin transactions. Check this out:OK, so 22 billion transactions per year. That gives us ~60 milion transactions per day, ~2.5 million transactions per hour, ~41000 transactions per minute and ~695 transactions per second.Right now, bitcoin requires about 275 bytes of transfer/storage per single transaction, which gives us 190 972 bytes of transfer/storage per second, 687 500 000 per hour, and 16 500 000 000 per day. Yeah, that is 687 MEGABYTES PER HOUR and 17 GIGABYTES PER DAY.If bitcoin is supposed to ever become LARGE like VISA or MasterCard, it has to be prepared to handle large amounts of transactions. And putting some additional crap in transactions will make the bandwidth/storage space requirements become VERY difficult for people who want to run their own clients (and i intend to).If you add for example only 100 bytes to each transaction (not much, right ?), then total amount of space&bandwidth will increase by almost 40%. And 17 Gigabytes per day is already enough. It matters, because he is the original bitcoin inventor and he has IMHO the best vision for this project.Is there somebody else i could trust more ? Not necessarily.You can place blockchain bootstraps in compressed *.zip or *.tar.gz files, and hardcode just multiple (RMD160, SHA1, SHA256 + Filezize) hashes of backups into mainstream client.OR, updated hashes of blockchain bootstraps can be avaiable for download from main bitcoin server over https, in which case it will be impossible to fake them (but this is a centralized solution, so probably not very good). Possibilities are endless. A link to porn addiction curing centre ?Just because somebody watches porn, does not mean he is addicted to it.The same goes with everything. You can be addicted even to chocolate (some women are), but that does not mean that everyone who eats chocolate is addicted to it. Oh my, dat is soo awsum. +10 to dis idea.Can we has dis idea implemented in mainstream client, plz ?I mean how could anybody refuse this soft fluffy little lolcat ? Thoughtcrime detected !Please don't go anywhere, a SWAT unit will be there in few minutes to pick you up. Same here.Merging bitcoin with some other completely unnecessary crap would be the worst idea of the century.I would welcome a fork with open arms in such a situation.If anybody wants to play, he should find himself a sandbox. We're doing serious buisness here, this is no place for toys. No. Only the total computational power of all your computers/servers/cores count. It doesn't matter if you split the power into 2 computers/cores, 1000 computers or do everything on a single ultra-powerful machine. Dollar ? Safe haven ? What cave did you just came out from ?When the **real** financial crisis comes, dollar will be the first to fall.Actually, destruction of dollar will be one of the first signs of collapse.EDIT:Dollar may be collapsing right now, as Chineese have started selling their reserves. In my country we have "Z deszczu pod rynnę", which means roughly the same.To topic author:  What hugolp is saying is right. Stay away from both these options.... it is far from safe investment. Save money by buying silver, platinum and land. Currencies, bonds, treasury bills are bad investments, thinking long-term. This is definition of awesomness.Especially that this could educate the people who don't like to study and read books, or at least motivate them to get to know more about economics.The current tragic economy state is caused by "normal" people not understanding what is actually going on in the economy.
You mean by brute-forcing private key of the wallet owner or what ? It is difficult for just "somebody" to gain enough trust on the interwebs to just start a fork of bitcoin.A value of currency is directly proportional of trust that people put in that currency.Currently, people trust Satoshi. To start an alternative currency, you have to gain trust and build your reputation, which is very difficult. And before that, you need to convince people why they should use your currency, not some other currency. Well, you can have multiple addresses and receive money to the other one, so probably no.And the address is not exactly the same as public key, is it ? Why so serious ? +1 Still, you have to know how many coins he has, otherwise the transaction will be invalid. Am i rigth ?So this makes things insanely difficult.Either you try to brute force private keys with simultaneous sending small amounts, which won't be very profittable, or you can try big amounts and risk producing invalid transactions. Will the private key be enough to steal somebody's wallet ? I concede with Peter Schiff and Gerald Celente, which are among the very few economists who have successfully forseen current financial crisis (google it). Well, Celente actually has like a 20-year long history of valid forecasts.From their opinions, one might conclude that some terrible financial disaster is coming, one which has not been seen in the history of mankind probably.Perhaps the perpetual circle of self - fueling debt will create something very unexpected.... Unexpected even for the banksters who probably caused the current crisis.I hope that this future event will create a chance for Bitcoin to adopt widely.Also, i wouldn't invest in Gold, since it is usually overpriced and suspectible to price spikes as everybody wants it and it is advertised as a remedy for the crisis. I would rather go silver, platinum which are more stable and predictable. Of course the last currency i would ever choose is dollar. I think they can, but knowing a Bitcoin address won't give you the money it posesses.Knowing the asset's address in Loom will. I have just read the FAQ ( https://loom.cc/faq ), and there is one thing i don't understand...Assets are a random hashes, just like bitcoin addresses are. How does loom protect people from guessing assets at random, if somebody for example trues to guess one trillion assets per second ?There will be a small possibility of guessing correct. Is there a limitation of how many assets can an entity request per unit of time ? This is sooooo obligatory...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS37SNYjg8wWomen, know your limits. Actually after giving it some thought, i think the free market's "They are private companies. They get to accept or deny whoever they like" approach is no longer valid.The reason for this is that when government is involved, we are no longer talking about free market.And the Mastercard's decision is purely political, so it has actually nothing to do with free market.This is what happens when government's start to mess in the economy. You are right. But there is not a lot of choice around... In most banks there is only Visa or Mastercard, so it is a nasty oligopoly.If VISA starts to doing the same, then we may have a problem.First they came for the torrents...Then they came for bitcoin. http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/12/22/2113241/RIAA-MPAA-Recruit-MasterCard-As-Internet-PoliceSo mastercard will block payments to sites MAFIAA tell him to, WITHOUT a court order. What's next ? They randomly block accounts of people with a hair color they don't like ? Did we land on Mars already, or this is a purely theoretical discussion ?  Sirius, would you care to create a no-sensitive-data version of backups so everyone can backup it like wikileaks ? Ah sure, forgot about that.Well, there is always a possibility of cutting out all sensitive data from the database to make a public read-only forum backup (nobody will be able to login to it since it would contain no hashes, so just read-only).But i guess that would be probably too much work. Electricity is also limited to the speed of light. Well hmmm...Subspace antennas ? ;P I myself would not ever dare to do anything serious on cyber cafe's computers. I mean the problem is not only the operating system. They can also install hardware keyloggers or sniffers.... the possibilities are endless.The only way i imagine it is using my own laptop. Plus a VPN and SSH tunnel of course. Actually, not only that. The codec they are using only works on low frequency range (11 Khz or something), and the codec is specifically tuned to compress human voice best. It will not carry very high or very low tones properly.So if you won't use correct frequencies, you will fail.
No problem.Are you planning to make some public site from which other people (such as myself) could download backups ?I can setup a backup server too (and act as a mirror backup), as i rent a few servers in datacenters here and there.You could probably setup a dedicated RSYNC server with bandwidth per user limit. There is even no need to give people SSH access actually. GSM networks only support well certain sound frequencies, but I'm sure it would be easy to encrypt digital 0s and 1s when using the correct frequency.This should not be very difficult actually.And BTW, this is an awesome idea. Even if they censor the internet (which is unlikely), we will still transfer bitcoins over phone. This means war. War on freedom. Yes, but it is also easy to do automatic MD5/SHA1/SHA256 signing of every file. So this is a non-issue really.Just add 5 more lines to backup script.Awesome. I can create a backup site myself easily.--------Also, here is the examplary RSYNC command to backup a folder of one server to another:Code:# rsync -rltgoDvzx root@server.1:/remote/backup/folder/path /path/to/local/backup/folder --inplaceIf you want to check what will the command do, without actually executing it, add "-n" parameter, which will do a so-called DRY RUN:Code:# rsync -rltgoDvzx -n root@server.1:/remote/backup/folder/path /path/to/local/backup/folder --inplaceIf the remote sever is on a different port than standard 22, then use this:Code:# rsync -rltgoDvzx -n root@server.1:/remote/backup/folder/path /path/to/local/backup/folder --inplace -e 'ssh -ax -c blowfish -p 40022'This is also a dry run, no files will be transferred. 40022 is naturally the port number and blowfish is type of encryption used for connection (it's the fastest one for transferring files).The "-rltgoDvzx" parameters will make rsync transfer entire directory recursively with all possible subdirectories, without files/dirs from other mounted volumes in the path. Try # man rsync to see what all the options mean. The only thing that implies is that you do not understand how rsync works.RSYNC uses privileges of given SSH user when accessing remote server. So if you create an unprivileged user, only give SSH public keys only to trusted people, and make all backups read - only, really nothing can happen.Also, you can setup a separate server with SSH daemon, which will be used for storing backups... So potential attacker will never have access to the main server.If you are really really really paranoid, You can even set up a chain of servers ROOT -> A -> B -> C, where ROOT SSH-connects to A and stores backups there, then B connects to A to download the backups, and C connects to B to download backup copies. And you only give access to C to the outside world.But i seriously doubt such a security measure will be ever needed. That is not a problem when using RSYNC.By default, RSYNC does not delete files that are deleted from remote server. So ? You can't make ANY "fake" coins accepted without first taking over more than 50% of the network processing power.Well - Actually you cannnot make "fake" coins at all.Even if you take over 51% of network, if any coin does not match the blockchain, it will be rejected by the rest (49%) of the network. The only thing you could do is double spend some transactions. You can use simple automated script to compress the files, encrypt them with PGP or Truecrypt, and then RSYNC them.Simple enough, no need to involve any emails in this. 1. Simple. Because the main server will not have access to the mirror servers. Only the mirror servers need access to root server, not the other way around.Neither the main server, or possible hackers don't need to know anything about what mirror servers are there, or how many of them is out there.2. Once you do one backup, you can create a chain of backup servers, where server A backups ROOT server, server B backups A server, and server C backups B server, making it nearly impossible to hack or even trace where all the backups are. All of this can be done with few simple RSYNC scripts.If you are thinking about government trying to hack or interfere with main site & mirror servers to bring them down, then I'm telling you: not a chance. Just look at the wikileaks case. There are thousands of wikileaks mirrors now. And it is quite easy to create new ones. Very powerful people had interest in killing wikileaks, yet they failed. Internet is already far more powerful & resilient than everybody expected.Even Russia government with all their dirty methods would not be able to make all wikileaks mirrors go offline if they wanted to. The only way to do that is shut down the internet completely. Currency should stay currency, domains should stay domains. This should be separate things.It is stupid to push something like this on the main client / blockchain. + 1, you have my full support. I can help writing some rsync scripts as i am experienced in it, if you're interested. 1. Gmailing backups is too complicated and slow.2. RSYNCed Backups on 10 other servers also cannot be deleted. RSYNC is an extremely powerful, stable, fast & totally command-line-scriptable app. You can use it to create a system of webserver backups. In fact it is widely used for Linux mirrors (Gentoo Linux uses this in its package management system). ....or you can simply use bitcoin for money transfers worldwide. Since I know something about Linux administration (and i have done something similiar already), i think can help here.OK, here is what needs to be done:1. Create a dedicated read-only MySQL or PostgreSQL (whichever is being used) database slave on the main bitcoin server.This slave will be used for doing quick full backups every hour or half an hour. That backups will be automatically packaged and put in a certain folder on the server.2. Create a bash or php script (about 10 lines) that will a) Backup the database and pack it to .tar.gzb) Backup directory structure of the webserver and pack it to tar.gzEvery X minutes.3. Create a low-privileged user on the main Bitcoin server, using which RSYNC/SSH will connect to the server and download backups.4. Setup another backup webserver - with apache/nginx/mysql/postrgre/whatever.5. Create a script that will regularly download current backups from the main server using RSYNC over SSH.6. Create a script that will ping/wget the main server to check if it works. If not, then the script will unpack last posessed backup, and then mstart apache/nginx/mysql7. Setup SSH public key authentication so that RSYNC can connect.8. ?? ??9. PROFIT ! Why so difficult ? Why make it complicated ?Make it simple. RSYNC, a simple-yet-advanced Linux program can distribute almost anything (even whole Linux partition) over SSH from server to server using public keys (passwords are not needed).An automated script ( about 10-30 lines of code) can automatically ping main server, restore last backup and start backup forum once the main forum fails.RSYNC is blazingly fast. It can distribute whole directory structure over SSH, being waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay much faster than any FTP.Quite easy to do actually. And how in the world could this happen ? We're literally like the opposite of censorship and closed mindedness. I confirm. It is at least the same high, or higher. I meant it is in the incubator and meets all criteria for inclusion, so it should be back on main wiki soon.
Article is no longer deleted, this topic should be good for closure. To which idea are you referring to ? The war ? Yeah, that's if people won't push WL to accept bitcoin, because that might also happen. The "bytes" were what i had in mind, thank you. Because almost every nerd is also a fan of Ron Paul. So how much data does the chain contain right now ? Yes, and this time "Bitcoin" is sitting next to "Ron Paul" and "Wikileaks" in the article header.So it is probably going to get hot soon. It maybe too difficult for a usual troll to understand how Bitcoin works.If you don't know anything about something, it is difficult to troll successfully. We have a heavy media coverage. We're on slashdot, again.http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/12/12/0647203/WikiLeaks-Money-and-Ron-Paul.This should be more than enough for inclusion. http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/12/12/0647203/WikiLeaks-Money-and-Ron-PaulSo the war has started.We should prepare defenses, it may get "interesting" soon. Unfortunately it may be too soon. Depends on what you call "mainline" and what you call "bitcoin".If "mainline client" = what satoshi proposes, because most of users trust his vision, then mainline it is. I would.I want a currency, and i don't want to download somebody's lady gaga because of somebody wanted to put it in the chain.Just think what you are saying. Is this supposed to be a currency or what ? Junkyard ?----BTWI hate Lady Gaga. WTF is privacy shark ?----EDIT:(After googling)Ah, this one http://www.privacyshark.com/ Nice job, Bruce.Are you some kind of journalist or something btw ? http://www.google.pl/search?q=bitcoin+wikileaks+pcworld&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.gentoo:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-aAs you said, the genie is out of the bottle. It is all up to wikileaks now.I sincererly hope they don't adopt bitcoin. Yeah, satoshi's and mine efforts may be in vain, because people already catched the idea, and an idea may be extremely hard to stop.I guess we should already prepare for the shitfight - Governments of the world vs Bitcoin & Internet.Actually the Govt vs. Internet is already started, what Internet needs now to become financially independent from governments using a decentralized currency.... such as bitcoin From another point of view: when wikileaks adopts bitcoin, then we will see the true power of it - this will be the ultimate test. If Bitcoin passes this test, then there is no stopping it anymore... Just watch your electricity bill. 5970 is a mighty bitch and consumes around 300-400 watts ?Also, i think that the miner also uses one core, but i might be wrong since i only tried CUDA miner which uses 100% of GPU plus 100% of one of my 4 cores.So yes, the electricity bill will hit you hard. Also, you need a new power supply, since usual power supply of usual Desktop PC will not be enough. What you are saying is either already irrelevant or is going to become irrelevant soon. The world is changing right now.The Open source philosophy & full anonymity provided by the internet (actually TOR, Freenet, I2P subnets etc) started entirely new era in the development of the humankind. Wikileaks case has clearly shown that. From now on, governments will no longer be able to keep the truth from people. And once most of people get to know the truth, they will understand that "traditional" banks are just robbing them of their money working together with governments. Once they learn the truth, they will abolish their opressors.This is already happening. There are massive demonstrations around the world agains the current system. People are tired with paying for banksters' mistakes and being enslaved by them. I'm completely convinced that current economy is going to totally fall within next 5-20 years.This is where Bitcoin comes in. Once the traditional economy is destroyed, "hard money" such as gold, silver and Bitcoin will fill the hole left by it. It is not about being scared.The problem is that powerful lobbying can hold mainstream adoption for decades.I do not want bitcoin to be underground currency forever. I'm saying that we should wait 1-2 years before going into deep water. And wikileaks is not even deep water. It is a storm. It is little discouraging but that is the truth.
Bitcoin is supposed to be currency by definition. Anything in it that is not directly currency-related can be classified as "junk".Perhaps separate protocols can be created for sending additional information based on private/public keys that already exist in bitcoin. Of course, but that is not my point.The point is that if would possible to store extra data in Bitcoin protocol by design, then government would have the argument like "you can store extra data (including kiddie porn) - protocol is designed that way and default client allows it".Taking this possibility away in the default client takes that argument away and makes Bitcoin much more resistant to kiddie-porn-propaganda-attack. Well I spport Satoshi completely in this matter.Leaving a possibility to store data in bitcoin chain is an accident waiting to happen. Just wait until somebody encodes kiddie porn into the chain - it would stay there forever. And the governments would have a perfect propaganda possibility for fighting it. "Normal" people won't use bitcoin at all if it is associated with perverts, mafia, and financial scams. Yeah you're right - when taking into account all costs of heroin addiction, including non-money costs such as health problems, family problems, social problems, then heroin has waaaay higher costs than anything else (but actually only because it is illegal & unclean/tainted). It doesn't have to cost anything.I have recently discovered that i have very strong will if i want to. Especially if i see that an addiction is destroying my body - this is the reason i don't smoke cigarettes even though i stay often in the same rooms with people who smoke and nicotine is present in my blood anyway.The problem with computer-related addictions is that they don't break down your body & mind - especially if you do some sports & care about your physical condition as well. So you don't have necessary incentive to drop such addictions. Also, I'm an IT specialist, so i guess i will be addicted to some game or other computer - related activity forever. that is no big problemthough, as I don't need to do it all the time - I can take longer breaks and it's fine. For some people it's facebook, for other it's World Of Warcraft. For me it is called "Minecraft".I have never played a game which would make me more dependant. I could play it for weeks without noticing external world I suppose heroin addiction cannot be much worse. Nice, but unless there are bitcoin exchangers in every country, such effort will probably have totally no effect.People need to exchange bitcoins for their local currency and do it locally, otherwise bitcoin is muich worse than western union or moneygram in terms of money transfers worldwide. Bullshit.Contrary to bitcoins, which are virtual and are only information bits, It is quite easy to track any physical evidence.There are millions of possible methods using which any "heroin store" or other drug store can be tracked.Let me just point out a few which came to my mind just now. This is surely only tiny part of what FBI/CIA/Whatever can use to track down location of the drug store.1. Analysing paper type used in packaging the packages - where it was bought, where was it produced. It can probably narrow down the search to s section of country (state or land).2. Analysing different residues that exist in the paper due to its previous location. Such residues may include :- Dust from special type of soil existing only in certain territory- Pollens from certain types of plants that exist only in a certain area, or have greatest concentration in certain area- Humidity of the paper -can help narrow the search if the drug store is near water or far from water- Chemicals in the paper (can narrow the search if drug store is located in a city/district with chemical plant, certain type of city etc)3. Analyse organic residues from the person doing packaging & their DNA4. Analyse the drugs themselves - repeat everything you have done with paper to the drugs & more.Just the few methods above will probably be enough to narrow down the search to a small district of a city, or just few blocks... If not, then probably some additional, beter methods exist.----Of course i realise that if you would be extremely, (or actually: INSANELY) careful, pack all stuff underwater to avoid polluting, buy your paper in another country, work in latex gloves all the time, use mailboxes in a different random city each time etc, then perhaps you could successfully stay anonymous for few years or something... But sooner or later you will make a mistake, because that's how human brain works. It always makes some number of mistakes, doesn't matter how hard you try. And when you make the one fatal mistake, FBI/CIA/CSI will get you. Wasn't somebody on this forum already selling some gold coins for bitcoin, just without the logo ? This may be quite a pointless demonstration, since Assange visit to police was appointed earlier and he let himself be arrested by purpose. Also, while bitcoin is in its infancy, we (bitcoiners) should avoid engaging in drugs, prostitution, weapon selling & other semi-legal activities.If bitcoin will lift off using money from fraudesters & gangsters, how in world will we ever manage to promote it to be a serious currency ? There is probably nothing to participate in in this thread, because the topic starter probably took the cash and ran off... This is exactly what I was saying all along, but nobody is listening.Bitcoin is not yet stron enough to take on such a huge task.Pushing bitcoin on wikileaks will kill bitcoin, and still it won't help wikileaks a lot. 1. This will never work.It is quite easy to track down any drug store by conventional means - by tracking the physical sent packages instead of coins themselves.2. (Yeah, i know, that i can't stop anybody from doing anything, but I'm just stating my opinion) Why do You people try so hard to kill bitcoin so quickly before it has a chance to get more audience ?I mean if You try to do every possible "dark businesses" such as drugs, prostitution, weapons through bitcoin, then You will quickly kill its mainstream adoption. Bitcoin will never become mainstream this way because governments will use all possible means to destroy it, the same as they are doing with wikileaks.Why not stay low profile for year or 2, and then hit it will full power ?For God's sake, at least give it a some time before starting half-legal or illegal buisnesses. Maybe by then we will be strong enough and achieve enough critical mass that we can't be stopped anymore...But this is all pointless, i don't even know why the hell I am even typing this... Well, at least i have said it. + 1.Let's just wait and see which one will become most popular and simply use it. Sorry for being too lazy to read all previous posts...But has anybody actually proposed using bitcoin algorithms to create decentralized DNS to Peter Sunde yet ? Agreed, i have already spoken about this in some other wikileaks-related topic (or perhaps this one ?).Engaging in wikileaks before Bitcoin has a chance to unfold its wings may kill it. I feel a disturbance in the force...Is it a revolution coming ? Yeah, that (log) difficulty one wasn't particulary useful.Price vs difficulty is another story. Was anybody here talking about reprap being finished in few years ?Reprap is probably decades from "completion" meaning when it will be possible to print something complex with it, without the need of any human intervention...
As witchspace already pointed out, things that are easy in Soviet Russia are not necessarily so easy in "normal" semi-democratic world.There are many problems:1. The matryr thing - as explained by witchspace2. Streissand Effect (similiar to creating martyrs). The more You want to censor something , the more people will download it.3. The wikileaks insurance (random people around the world may have the key and they will release it when time comes4. Bad PR for USA if they start shooting people from wikileaks. I mean what would be the difference between them and Russia/China if they do this ? None. This could further break diplomatic relations with (semi)democratic countries. Surely a lot of people have the key.Good luck finding them on TOR or freenet. (FYI: TOR is completely untrackable when connecting from one TOR node, to another TOR node, contrary to connecting to/from "normal internet" from/to TOR). If that was so easy as You said, they would have done so long ago. Wikileaks is not here since yesterday.Also, wikileaks has the encrypted insurance file already distrubuted among people long ago (God knows what it may contain ? perhaps 9/11 inside job proof ?). USA may be also afraid of that. That's probably because USA is not Soviet Russia (yet).They started censorship, but there is still long way from that to becoming a true totalitarian country like Russia.If they torture or murder somebody from wikileaks, they really risk getting their asses kicked on the international arena. I like that idea of Yours, however what i don't like about it is the amount of time it needs to become reality.However i guess we don't have any choice, as the "old economy" will never adapt - I concede with you there. Bankers & other people who gain from the current system will never resign of their false fraudulent dream world, unless it totally collapses itself first.No need for that, they cannot really "shut down the internet". They would have to take all the physical equipment away from people - Linux servers, routers, switches, wires, cables etc. And that is not possible at all without some major disaster (nuclear war or something).They cannot take our equipment from us, and with the equipment geeks will quickly build a new internet from the scratch. It's just a matter of little rewiring & changing configuration. Not so difficult as one would think. +1Also, i concede with 98% of opinions stated in the movie. Although it perhaps simplifies some things too much, this is still how the money making works today. Banking industry == Legalized fraud Really is that so ? http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/ worked perfectly for me for the last 12 or 18 hours. I'm only saying that it may be difficult for bitcoin to go mainstream, but i seriously doubt they can stop adoption in general.They would have to shut down the internet entirely, which is not easy (possible breaking ICANN is not enough, we can always use alternative DNS roots).So far they have failed. I hope it stays that way. Overwriting ICANN IP's at ISP level should not be very hard in case of USA starts to really censor the interwebs.Also, it is probably quite easy to do on Linux. http://torrentfreak.com/u-s-government-seizes-bittorrent-search-engine-domain-and-more-101126/http://www.osnews.com/story/24074/US_Government_Censors_70_WebsitesBeginnings of censorship ?USA has finally shown its true fascist face. I wonder if bitcoin domains will be on the list...Discuss. Yeah, but the idea shown in the clip is one thing that i liked about that movie  WOW, now You have surprised me.Paypal is a piece of some nasty shit ! I will just leave this here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-KU7MD_3Hk I think this is the original one:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH_DkBI9Qsk Can't paypal be used with paysafecards and such, to avoid debits & extra charges ? Yeah, but it is not yet ready for an average-guy from what I understand ... ? + 1+100 to that LOL Doesn't bitcoingateway work only for US citizens ? I would. Dark pool ? Nice, i didn't know about it.That may be a good explanation.
Yeah, but could we get back on the topic ?I second this, unless somebody has better proposition.But still, i find the not-so-rising  BTC/USD course worrying. This is a deflationary currency after all. Yes, but that probably means something. There must be something deeper than that going on. There is something weird going on in the BTC market:The volume constantly decreases, while the price remains unchanged...What does it mean ? Are we seeing market stagnation ? Or is the bitcoin overpriced perhaps ? Or maybe large speculators wants to fool us into thnking so ?Can somebody with knowledge of currency markets put this in perspective ? This is at least suspicious. Well FBI / CIA may be able to read the data after you zero-fill it once or twice.To absolutely securely erase the data, you need to do at least several passes, each writing random data on the drive. There is a specialized software avaiable for this, however You can just use this command several times:Code:dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/deviceon Linux. Just boot up an Ubuntu LiveCD. Replace "/dev/device" with the disk you want to erase (eg. /dev/sda or /dev/sdb).Of course make sure first if you are cleaning the right disk - any data will be irreversibly lost: You have been warned. Formatting a drive does **not** remove any data.The data is still there, but in an unorganized fashion.Any undelete software (example: GetDataBack NTFS) can recover the files. It also works perfectly well on encrypted Truecrypt volumes (checked myself).Also, one need to be careful when selling a hard drive, because any data, that hasn't been securely erased or filled with zeros, can be easily resurrected. Well, they are probably safe anyway for small amounts. They wouldn't really gain from scamming small traders - it would only create a lot of bad PR on the web for them.But after reading what bitcoinex said, i wouldn't dare to trade any larger amounts (>$800) with them. I mean that the creator will have to show somewhere to speak publicly... An interview would be nice.A lot of people would like to see the face of the creator. People generally put more trust in things that have a "face" behind them. Thanks for the info, bitcoinex.But i don't think there is an alternative which offers the same level of fraud protection. Why hasn't somebody just opened a service with one time SMS codes like liqpay yet ?Does anybody know similiar alternative ? I did a background google check on Liqpay and it seems ok. There is just one guy on some forum who claims he was scammed by them, but i am not sure if i should trust that,http://exchangemoneyforum.com/entry.php?190-Liqpay-Is-SCAM-gt-gt-gt ,Because the exchangemoneyforum looks to be scam itself on WOT:http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/exchangemoneyforum.comAnd on google:http://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&q=exchangemoneyforum.com+scamAlso, Liqpay scores good on WOT:http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/liqpay.comBut there is also some guy on WOT who complains in russian that "Money received on account is almost impossible to spend. The same Skype, you can not replenish the account.", but I am not sure what he means by "almost" exactly and I'm not sure i should trust that opinion either.EDIT:Did some more checks on site advisors & checked google trends for spikes in popularity:http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/liqpay.comhttp://safeweb.norton.com/report/show?url=liqpay.comhttp://www.google.com/trends?q=liqpay%2C+liberty+reserve%2C+pecunix%2C+alterpay&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0Looks clean to me. Also, it has biggest popularity in Ukraine. I completely disagree.It will never be good for bitcoin PR, if the creators never show anywhere. The truth is nobody can catch the concept & explain the idea better than the creator... Not necessarily.The difficulty only shows the total computing power of the network, which is rising fast. However, that may mean that only small number of tech savvy people is running more and more clusters & gpu miners...However I wouldn't treat difficulty as a good factor for measuring bitcoin popularity in general public.  I think i agree with caveden - having such an important constant hardcoded in bitcoin may be devastating at some point when the network changes significantly or grows much larger than it is now.Generally, almost every important value in core of bitcoin algorithms should be a non-constant elastic variable which can adapt to changes.Anyway, I still really would like to see Satoshi's & Gavin's opinions on this. Some people might use noscript, adblock and other blockers for increased security/privacy.Have you thought about that ? The feature You are talking about seems like 50-100 lines of PHP or bash shell code to me.Why not just write another application which will communicate with bitcoin via RPC ?If it's so easy, merchants can do it themselves. Liqpay is probably the way to go from all soft money.It has the best anti-fraud protection. From my googling it seems that it is almost fraud-free. More like "i wonder what colour should i paint my space shuttle ?". WOW, it's even better than i though.PHP has actually **TWO** different libraries just for doing arbitrary precision arithmetics ! This is awesome. PHP FTW. Actually, i think that BC_MATH extension is compiled-in PHP in most Linux distributions. If I am wrong, then You will probably have to compile a version with that yourself.I don't remember ever selecting "bc_math" extension in ubuntu/debian when installing PHP anyway, sho it should be built-in. I cannot confirm this for sure, because I'm not running debian/ubuntu now. Can somebody else confirm this ? ...not in PHP.
I'm not saying the prices should stay the same.By "stable" i meant actually "rising in a predictable manner".You are right about this: If the BTC/USD or BTC/EUR course stays in place, that will mean bitcoin economy is dying. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency by design, and if BTC value does not rise, it will mean that something is wrong. The situation seems to have been stabilized.Large speculation is no longer changing the BTC/USD course lke crazy. I agree with all of these suggestions.Trading should be done with (almost ?) absolute rounding precision, if possible. No, you have it wrong, because You are talking about databases, not PHP. PHP does not have something like "decimal types" as far as i know.But PHP has the strings, which can store almost anything with any precision you need. Actually I think i remember Satoshi or Gavin saying that it actually is a quite easy change as bitcoin was designed so that decimal places can be added indefinately. Precisely, i believe that in PHP it may be best to store floats as pure strings, and convert them when necessary. There were some nasty bugs in float-to-float comparisons in PHP, i don't remember if they fixed them all. I don't know if mtgox knows or uses this, but PHP has special set of functions for this kind of things - it's called BC_MATH.http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.phpWith it, it is possible to count any number with any needed precision. I propose a new way to distinguish between bitcoins with different decimal numbers - BTCX.1 BTCx0 = 1 BTC1 BTCx1 = 0.1 BTC1 BTCx2 = 0.01 BTC1 BTCx3 = 0.001 BTC1 BTCx4 = 0.0001 BTC... and so on. I know that it may look weird, but i think this is the most intuitive way describing different-sized parts of the same currency.Unless somebody knows a way to further improve this.EDIT:Perhaps some other character that looks better can be used instead of "X" - for example:Code:1 BTC-0 = 1 BTC1 BTC-1 = 0.1 BTC1 BTC-2 = 0.01 BTC1 BTC-3 = 0.001 BTC1 BTC-4 = 0.0001 BTC This is theoretically good, however it is not enough. When bitcoin goes into 6th or 8-th decimal place, You will run out of prefixes which can be recognized by more than 1% of general population... So we have the explanation.Just use some good (and paid) VPN service for all Your traffic. Your problems should disappear. I think that there are very few people on this forum except Satoshi and Gavin, who have the qualifications. https://lwn.net/Articles/414452/Somebody of us should go there and answer questions/resolve issues asked in the comments below the article.LWN.NET is read by some important figures in the geek world, so it would be probably good for Bitcoin PR if we do that.Perhaps it should be even Satoshi himself or Gavin Andresen, because they have the best understanding of the Bitcoin algorithms. BTW, somebody of us should go there and answer questions/resolve issues asked in the comments below the article.LWN.NET may be read by some important figures in the geek world, so it would be probably good for Bitcoin PR if we do that.Perhaps it should be even Satoshi himself or Gavin Andresen, because they have the best understanding of the Bitcoin algorithms. Yeah, i would also check if Your ISP is not spying on You / sniffing Your traffic.In Soviet Russia, everything is possible  Now, about ancient Sumerians, that was an ...unlucky accident.Unfortunately it came up, that during the early tests of the temporal spacetime vortex activator in 2078 a small part of the S.A.T.O.S.H.I. team was jumped back to about 4700 BC without a possibility of going back.All the employees of SATOSHI corp were given strict orders not to interfere with the timeline, but it looks that either them or some of their descendants broke that rule which probably gave birth to Sumerian civilization. That's only partially correct. These are the corporations who sent him back from the future. But they formed a single huge corporation in 2075, in joined effort to pefect time travel technology. Fortunately for us, they succeeded in 2083. Actually, Satoshi is a robot sent from the future to stop the largest currency crisis in the history of mankind, and the nuclear war that followed the political chaos caused by it."Use bitcoin if you want to live !"I mean, come on - it's obvious. I recently stopped producing bitcoin on my GPU which had about 26 Mhash together with CPU.Unfortunately, the amount of generated coins didn't pay for for the electricity bill increase.However NVIDIA GPU's are very cost-ineffective when it comes to generating bitcoins, i think that bitcoin generation of people with AMD Radeons 57xx, 58xx, 59xx, 6xxx surely pays for the bills at least (yet). But with the difficulty increasing in the current speed, they won't be able to earn even for the bills in just 2-3 months. Mtgox dropped liqpay ?I have never seen "liqpay" option on mtgox website. Exactly. This especially applies to Windows. The "user-friendly" features there are leaving so many traces of everything everywhere, that it is difficult to hide anything from anybody at all. Also, lack of trusted application repositories with digital signatures allows a lot of possibilities of trojan & virus automated installation.This is one of the reasons i stopped using it. I don't like to be traced or spied upon. Everyone deserves privacy.
You need to do at least 2 things to make your bitcoins safe (not 100% safe, but safe enough for everyday usage).1. Switch to Linux or BSD (or at least switch the computer having Bitcoin installed)2. Use Truecrypt.3. (optionally) Don't install anything outside of the official repositories of Your distro. Otherwise You risk potential downloading of some malware.And i mean it not because I'm some kind of Linux fanboy. I say that deadly seriously: if you want Your bitcoins safe, don't use windows. I just checked it. Seems to be true. Actually, I'm not talking about "credit" cards, but "payment" cards.In my country, "payment" cards are very popular, while "credit" cards not so much.The only difference between both of them is that you cannot take credit with "payment" card.I do not want to have anything to do with "credit", I just care about easyness of money transfer which is given by credit/payment cards & paypal.Few minutes after making the payment money are avaiable on the receiver's account - that cannot be beaten by anything at the moment (except bitcoin). Wait, i meant "extremely large" on bitcoin scale, not on world scale. This is relative.Actually, by "speculation" i mean repeatedly buying and selling large amounts of bitcoins in a short amount of time.Agreed here. Isn't Liqpay a soft currency with reversable transactions the same as Paypal, MoneyBookers or Credit Cards ?Or am I wrong ?So this doesn't solve the general problem. No i haven't seen it. The servers are blazingly fast for me.Perhaps your proxy/tunnel/vpn/tor/whatever is malfunctioning.If you're getting bad transfers from russia, perhaps You should try tunneling to some fast-internet country as USA, france or germany. There are some VPN's & SSH accounts for tunneling for sale there.Also, check Your DNSes - the problems may be caused by slow domain resolving. Yeah, but that time is not the case at the moment.We need the "little guys" to come in and buy out enough of bitcoins - only then the extremely large scale speculation will decrease and prices will stabilize.But i guess that's completely natural with every rising market/currency. http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1350.0 This is why i dislike large scale speculation.There is a relatively small group of people with server farms & multiple radeon cards who own most of bitcoins and they can almost completely control the market.At the moment, bitcoin prices are not governed by free market, but by large speculators. We need more of small players, so the bitcoins can diversify between another nodes some more. If somebody makes something better, another poll can be added.People should know what is the most popular option - that will make decision easier. We already discussed this issue extensively. Satoshi is definately *NOT* a government agent.Good point. @satoshiDoes this version contain new blockchain "checkpoints" to secure the "official" chain ?Could you please inform us about every checkpoint being inserted in news such as this ? Have we arrived at any conclusion ?A poll perhaps, somebody ? This awesome, thx.How come i haven't noticed it earlier ? I have noticed that there was large traffic increase on the forums lately.I was wondering - is it just caused by naturally increasing popularity of Bitcoin, or did we get some large press/blog/reddit/digg coverage again ?BTW,Can somebody confirm or deny that the forum has increased traffic in last 3 days ? Solution:Use Truecrypt.Using bitcoin without encrypting the wallet is at best irresponsible anyway. Money should be kept in safe => bitcoins should be kept on an encrypted hard drive. Not a problem.Truecrypt also supports hidden hard drives inside encrypted "standard" hard drives.This gives You plausible deniability - if asked, You can give the password to Your outer volume, and there is no way of detecting if there is another hidden volume in the outer volume, because the data has enough entropy to look completely random.So they can't put You in jail for not disclosing password anymore. Actually, it's more like 97 years of propaganda and brainwashing...1913 - creation of FED.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System#HistoryAs long as the FED lobbysts and propagandists exist, i wouldn't expect the situation to change. They just have too much power. Update: i have installed fresh AMD64 gentoo on my VM.The things left to do is update it and test if the ebuild works.I think i should be done in 2 days.EDIT - update:Unfortunately, my bigger (750GB) hard drive just died, so there is no chance of doing anything at the moment...I will try to sit on it next weekend... >90% of people are still completely unaware of what we are talking here.They will only understand it once it is too late.
I don't think so much information can be encoded into just ONE address, is there a way of putting multiple addresses into the generated block ?Anyway, only the person who put the porn in the chain can be treated as responsible, which makes rest of us innocent.I think just any court would see this as obvious. The software is not even designed to send files between participants... This is a clear case to me. Looks crappy to be precise. I wonder how difficult would it be to make the number of possible addresses something like 10 ^ 200. You see ? Told ya. Definately not enough  That actually depends on the algorithm.Because if the algorithm used to create the addresses does not have enough "randomness" in it, then such event may occur much faster, than it should judging from probability. Not even a chance, unless you wait long long time before selling the bitcoins You generated. If the difficulty will rise in the speed it is currently rising, then Your income will halve approximately every 2 weeks...Also, as said previously, CPU generation is currently pretty useless. The only thing that produces enough coins per watt is GPU miners - specifically ATI/AMD GPU miners. I was going the create a virtual machine and install "fresh" gentoo on it, but i didn't have a lot of time lately.I have a super-long weekend now, so i guess i will try to fix it till sunday. Not really, but i still don't like it. I am a programmer and i what like more are 0 and 1 states: either it is possible or not. So "impossible" is much more interesting for me than "so improbable that almost impossible".PS.Bankers also won't like the "highly unlikely" thing. BTW, How does Bitcoin make sure that every generated address is unique ?Is it just at random + seed, so there is a theoretical possibility of collision one in a billion billion times ? I like this solution better: Just toss all the bitcoins into one bag, randomize the receivers, and send random coins to random people (but with correct amounts) while making sure the coins of A (sender) don't go to B - use coins of somebody else.However the problem with that is that there have to be some extra coins always avaiable in the "proxy bag". So perhaps some temporary period should be applied, like 1 hours, giving the proxy time to collect right amount of coins. Or the proxy can have some extra deposited coins for this occasion. Yeah, somebody should convince them to accept bitcoin... They can't shoot bitcoin or bittorrent itself, but they can discourage big buisnesses from accepting bitcoin. And that can easily hold mainstream adoption even for tens of years.They (governments) are very good in this particularly. Large companies such as Google, Microsoft, Wal-mart etc are very susceptible to government regulations. Since there is nothing more to say here, i'm locking the topic. Since the idea of motivating local stores to accept bitcoin is IMHO pointless, i have another proposition which could work in the close future (1 year):Motivating big currency exchangers in centres of major cities to accept internet currencies: Bitcoin, Liberty Reserve, Pecunix and such.Because those companies are already into "currency buisness", they may be much easier to motivate to use electronic currencies, than local stores.After people could exchange money for bitcoin on their street, perhaps it will be much much easier to motivate markets/supermarkets/shops to accept bitcoin. It is a timed paypwall - the article will be avaiable in 1 week. Can you name some of that podcasts ?BTW,nonagendamarket, I wonder where do You get all the info about new articles about bitcoin ? Do you just google bitcoin regularly, or is it something more ? Why do i feel more and more convinced that the internet era will end governments in the form we know them ?  Actually, if i tell you that "there is money in the safe of bank XXX", that is information about whereabouts too.The same if I tell you that there is some heroin (which is itself illegal) in the police storage facitilities.And all that informations are legal, the same as bittorrent should be legal, because it is only information about whereabouts of other information, which logically should be NEVER illegal.But the governments together with media industry are trying hard to make BitTorrent (and all P2P in gerneral) illegal, in spite of obvious idiocy of such doing. Too much speculation.~0.20$ is the real current value. The rest is speculation. OK, but how does it relate to the topic ?
I hope you're right.Well, they already claim that something like "exchanging information about whereabouts of data" (BitTorrent sites) is illegal, so why not this ? I see no large difference. I already said that if they would be working on another currency and another block chain, there is no way to use that chain to corrupt our chain. The different chains cannot mix or join or whatever. You do not understand how bitcoin works. EDIT: The only thing that can be done is to use tremendous computing power to produce > 50% blocks in the network, and make those FAKE blocks - this should allow double-spending some transactions under some circumstances. But still, that won't hurt the bitcoins You already have in Your wallet.There is actually no way for now to corrupt the whole current chain, as there are in-code checkpoints/checksums that make sure that only the official satoshi's client is used.  Yeah this may be good for wikileaks, but not nocessarily good for Bitcoin. If bitcoin becomes publicly associated with wikileaks before going semi-mainstream, then it will be viewed by the "ruling class" (read: US government) as a tool for doing money laundering and another "gray" buisnesses. This may make bitcoin be considered by governments as a serious threat, and they will start fighting it too soon, holding back mainstream adoption.Of course i know that they (governments) will start fighting bitcoin at some point, but the later, the better. If we go mainstream first, then such efforts will be probably futile, and BTC will probably be unstoppable without shutting down whole internet. Nah, i still don't think what You're saying is possible.Thousands people will not just jump from one currency to another, because the other one has more hashing power ?No, this makes no sense.Bitcoin is popular and it has worth, because people trust satoshi, satoshi's implementation of bitcoin. Trust is not something that you can gain overnight... So many people jumping instantly from one currency to another because the other one is getting more popular or something... Nah, not possible.--Also, i don't think You understand properly how bitcoin works, and this is the source of your hilarious ideas. Not possible. Different chains can never collide or join together.This is pure FUD. I told You already what is wrong with it, this website is terrible and untrustworthy.Looks very unprofessional. Does any serious economic theories exist supporting what you are saying ?After what is happening currently at MtGox (price down to ~0,18$), i don't think i am going to be convinced that speculation stabilizes prices... This is jibberish, i can't read it.And You are probably a troll. Wait, are you telling me you didn't know that each screen increases the total processing power of your setup by 10 orders of magnitude ?  Exactly. I find it very hard to believe that speculation **STABILIZES** prices.I remember a case in my country when speculation caused our currency to jump by about 20% in matter of 48 hours. This is not what i would call "stable".Perhaps only SMALL speculations sptabilize currency, but big ones surely can even damage large markets. The current prices don't seem like very stabilized in spite of large speculation on mtgox...However it is very different on btcex.com, where prices of bitcoin to russian RUB is steadily rising.https://btcex.com/I don't know where the speculation is bigger, but i would guess that on mtgox (and i would probably be right).So i wouldn't be so sure that speculation stabilizes prices, that is very risky statement. @gavinandresen, @grondiluOK, I am satisfied with Your answers.Bitcoin wins again in my eyes. Thx. Fork bitcoin ? What for if we can easily schedule things to happen X years in future ?Let's assume there will be a technological breakthrough, and the computing power will go up 10-fold, or 100-fold in a matter of year. Is Bitcoin still safe ? I think not. It will be much easier for somebody to redo a part of the chain and perhaps fake some transactions.Technological breakthroughs do happen, it is not something unrealistic at all.(I'm trying to be paranoic, because that's good when it comes to security) From what i understand about the algorithms used, after the SHA256->512 update, it would no longer be possible for old (unupdated) clients to connect to the network, as their block chain would be rejected by all the new nodes.Because bitcoin works on semi-fixed timeframes, it is possible to "schedule" a certain update to happen after some time (after block number XXXX), and this is exactly what i am suggesting. The change could happen even YEARS after the update (in this case, block 200.000 = about 12 months from now). All clients will be probably updated to the new version by then.  Forget it. Not even a chance.Not gonna happen in the closest future. Maybe in few years.Small buisnesess only adopt things after things go mainstream. Not a chance of this happening any earlier. Sure, there is an exception from every rule, so perhaps few small stores could be persuaded to accept bitcoin soon, but i seriously doubt any wider adoption. Lately there have been major technological breakthroughs, such as memristors, graphene-based transistors and so which will probably greatly increase processing power of computers yet to come. So i propose a (relatively simple ?) change which would make bitcoin prepared for a 10-fold or more increase in computers' speed in the close future. Change hashing algorithm from SHA-256 to SHA-512 from block 200.000 or 250.000. This would raise the bar of difficulty of attacking the network.Bitcoin is gaining popularity fast, so we should be prepared for the worst. IMHO it's better to be safe than sorry. Also, the more serious we get about network security, the more seriously will companies & other "serious" entities look at bitcoin resulting in wider adoption.  Dear Sir, that is pure juicy AWESOMNESS !Bitcoin rocks ! mtgox:So what about fees ? Are ya going to decrease them once you get back stolen paypal fraud money ? Ah, I didn't know about it, perhaps i am mistaken. The market didn't crash... Mtgox has just introduced trade fees of 0.65%, and that has apparently killed most of the speculation.
And the crazy speculation is already over !I guess the fee must have helped.--@mtgox: are You planning to remove the fee after You get back the cash from paypal fraud ?Is mtgox.com going to be free later, or is it staying paid forever ?Or perhaps are You going to decrease the fee ? Somehow i feel that high value rises will be common thing for bitcoin, as it is a strongly deflationary currency.We will have to just get used to it.Also, BTC is not exactly impredictable. If the value of BTC will for long time keep rising fast, then this will be considered normal, and it will possibly be predictable enough to do buisness. Classic speculation ?Move along, nothing to see here. Actually, dollar haven't already collapsed because of just one reason: All oil can be only bought for dollars, so every country in the world has to keep some dollars reserves to buy oil.USA are taxing entire world using inflating dollar this way (but that's another story). The lower dollar goes, the more taxed rest (non-US) of the world is.EDIT:Saddam Hussein wanting to sell oil for EURO instead of dollar is probably the sole reason for Iraq war. Now guess what: Iran wants to sell oil for euro. USA starts talking about war.... Also, You can drink gold as well, if you care/can afford it:http://www.daylife.com/photo/0deIenr5yA0Zc?q=Dubaihttp://nfl.msg.com/photo/0fgz4pV9Mad2M?q=Dubaihttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/photo/06MB6Gg2EBdFy?q=GOLD Well it's good as long as the user is required to enter some "advanced hardcore settings", but it shoould never be in a way, where You install bitcoin, and the first thing that pops up is "would you like to use the official chain or one of the less-official chains X, Y or Z" window.Sure, official client can support multiple chains, but only through some hardcore/advanced configuration option i think. Also, multiple warnings like "do you really know what are you doing" should appear if user chooses another chain. Actually You are completely right.I didn't bother checking them on wot first, before giving opinions.So many scam reports, this is just juicy and delicious:http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/talkgold.comSo i guess centregold will be probably safe. + 1.Also, there should be an easy way to make backup of the wallet, without having to shut down the client. Perhaps having wallet manager in separate process would simultaneously make that easier.BTW,Make a poll about this please. So if the block generation speed will keep accelerating in current manner, does that mean that number of bitcoins will actually rise 50% faster than it should in theory ?And can this be prevented by a release of an updated client ? I would be careful with them trading bigger amounts of money... they are yellow on WOT.http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/centregold.caCaution is advised.Also, see this topic:http://www.talkgold.com/forum/showthread.php?t=258133&page=1EDIT:This actually looks worse than i expected:http://www.talkgold.com/forum/showthread.php?t=258133&page=5It is probably a scam. + 1.Somebody make a poll perhaps ? Weird. Even with the locks in source code ?I thought we were talking that the "checkpoints" in source make that kind of attack impossible.You already have an ability to choose: You can write/fork Your own client, which will use a different chain. It is a little complicated, but choice exists.But adding an option to select different chain from official one.... that would only create unnecessary mess and perhaps even panic on the markets. I think we want bitcoin to be stable before all else, so if somebody wants to use different chain or different network, perhaps simply a forked client should be made for that. I only want that for the sake of greater network security against double spending attacks done by network takeovers.I do not want generation for the generation itself. + 1, however this may be difficult to implement.Also, i don't like the idea of removing mining from Bitcoin completely. Perhaps it should use 10-25% of PC's computational power by default to make network stronger and more resistant to attacks. If user wants, he can shut down the block generation. I wouldn't be so fast, they are yellow on WOT:http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/centregold.ca ROTFL. http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php Right, because Western Union is non-drawbackable, as is Liberty Reserve. So called "HARD" currencies.In contrary to Paypal, MoneyBookers, Credit cards, Alterpay etc, which are drawbackable SOFT currencies.BTW,Are you by any chance officially associated with Liberty Reserve ?I am asking because 1) You sound professional 2) You have their logo in Your avatar. Awww fcuk. This is madness. THIS IS SPARTA !!!! Bitcoin's implementation of SSE4 is probably optimized better for AMD processors - somebody already complained about it on the forums i think...So i guess filing a bug would be in order.
Nothing. Probably the bitcoin's implementation of 4-way SSE simply does not support Your processor.1. Make sure Your processor actually supports it2. File a bug (do we have a bug tracking system yet ?) Actually as far as i understand currency calculations, [all bitcoins in existence] x [current exchange USD] != [total value of all bitcoins in USD].So the whole market is probably worth less than 1.000.000 USD, but i have no idea how much exactly.How does one calculate such things ? Hey, that's even better.But i just thought that only satoshi runs this server, so nobody else has access to do such thing. BTW.You can use this firefox extension to recover any form (and any post) You lost due to connection failure.It's pretty cool.Going back to the topic: yeah the bitcoin.org servers seem overloaded by traffic.Satoshi should invest in better servers soon or there could be a problem.With the amounts of bitcoins he has, that shouldn't be an issue. On what hardware ? OK, I re-license all of my modifications on the same license (if necessary).Effective immediately.I will also modify the wallet image so that it has bigger "B", just give me some time.EDIT: Not necessary, actually. I will say the same as in the previous deflation-related topic:Currency inflation encourages both wise investments and stupid investments, while currency deflation encourages only smart investments.With deflating currency it is not beneficial to take big risks while one can earn more with just keeping money in his socks.The question is: is that good or bad ? I personally think it is good, because :1. If people stop doing stupid investments, there will be less of poor people.2. People will be able to get richer just by keeping money in a safe. So anybody can invest easily, poor & stupid people too.3. Less stupid investments = less financial crisises.So the conclusion is that difference between rich and poor will decrease. Everyone will get richer. Deflationary economy IMHO should be more stable than inflationary economy. You completely missed the point. Hardcoded security checkpoints are part of the consensus.Consensus is created & confirmed simply by people's usage of satoshi's client.If we wouldn't like that consensus, we would find ourself a different, forked consensus.And i have no reason to trust & believe either you, or the topic starter. LOL, this is cute.BTW, bitboy - are You japanese by the way ? Are you serious about this at all ?Because no serious financial institution would ever use a currency with such "feature". Currency must be stable by design. The more stable & predictable it is, the better. This is the exact reasons for hard-coded block chain locks in bitcoin client. The problem is that without proper security, somebody with mega-super-duper computing power could make a longer, fake chain, and Your app could accept it.And bitcoin is all about the security, because (i think) it will get serious soon, and we want it to be seen as serious currency.If you want, you can make your own client, and then hard-code some checkpoints for **your** own main chain in **your** client. Or not. Whatever. Surely he's going to spend everything on sex, drugs & rock-and-roll.BTW,Don't hookers accept bitcoin yet ?  No, please be serious guys.This logo is just horrible. Not to say it looks lame & unprofessional. Sorry to the author, but this is the truth. Sorry, i totally don't like it. It is just bad. But that's just my opinion. PS.Vote, anybody ? 1. Because you are not asking correct questions, so You will never receive the answers You are seeking. Learn to articulate your wishes without spreading unnecessary FUD.2. Most of us here are not BTC developers, just random geeks. If You have a serious question, then either:a) Go ask the developers on IRC ORb) Release a patch ORc) Release a fork3. You haven't even properly explained your stance in technical details, or proposed a patch. You expect serious answers without being serious Yourself. Of course, but these are accidental vulnerabilities.I meant putting vulnerabilities on purpose. Vulnerabilities like this are usually easily detectable. Publishing an open source app with an exploit in source ?That would be foolish. I don't think Satoshi is stupid. After all, he invented bitcoin.Sooner or later somebody would find the exploit easily. A lot of hackers & programmers have invested their time in this code (and as people invest a lot of money in bitcoin, they will surely do full code review), so it is highly improbable that somebody wouldn't find the exploit by accident. And why would be your "consensus" any better than the consensus we have now ?I seriously doubt You are going to achieve anything here.Also, i think You are either spreading FUD around to make BTC weaker or you are some kind of scammer. For the record, if you are looking for stupid people that can be easily influenced, You are not going to find many of them here.If you have a suggestion how bitcoin could be made better, just join the bitcoin IRC or post a patch somewhere.If you don't like bitcoin the way it is now, start a fork and encourage people to use Your version - that's really simple. You are talking jibberish man.If you can make a longer chain and break bitcoin, prove it. I don't think You get the whole concept of open source properly.In open source there is no "they", no entity that you could say "runs" the buisness.Open source is governed by consensus of programmers, hackers, mathematicans & other geeky people involved in the project.If one day satoshi says "ok guys, it was just a joke with this bitcoin thing, i'm closing down the project", then we (the hackers) would simply fork the code, move to another forum, and pick up where we left here. Bitcoin would stay as it was or in a little modified form.There is no single mastermind in Open Source. It's more of a brain where a single human is just a cell. Also, bitcoin works as it works and has the block chain it has, because people involved with the project want it. If somebody doesn't like it, he can start his own project.----EDIT:Also, if you don't like what we are doing with the bitcoin or block chain, then start your own fork of bitcoin. Nobody forbids it.
Bitboy, would You consider releasing the logotypes under public domain, if You get some ?Perhaps we should organize a donation thread. Oh sorry, was i offensive again ? That's weird, i didn't feel it at all.You're right, actually the logo from my signature (designed by bitboy and improved by myself) may be better than the official one.However i don't know if Satoshi will like the license (cc by-sa).IMHO perhaps Satoshi should either ask the author or pay the author some BTC to release the works into public domain. I think You're talking too professional.Is "Money as Debt" so professional ? I guess not. And i think it is much cheaper than that. I have prepared alternative, bigger "B" versions of the same logotype on the same license: This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.(Only the biggest one is a little blurred, because i lack a SVG version to stretch it to any resolution, the others are OK)Enjoy. Also, please do not hotlink as this is my private site.EDIT: This is sweet,However the "B" in the circle is IMHO definately too small.It should fill up almost whole circle, because if You scale down the image, the "B" will not be visible.Same applies to this one:It looks nice, however i can hardly see the "B". And i have a proper vision. Imagine what trouble somebody with a worse vision will have. $2520 should be more than enough to create nice animated movie, like "Money ad Debt", but shorter.Still no contestants ? Stop complaining. The current logo is just good enough.It has all the properties a good logo should have.PS.After bitcoin goes mainstream, satoshi will be incredibly rich and he can afford some professional artist to polish it more PS2.After some consideration, i think that the logo could be easily polished a little by adding some more 3D-effect to the coin borders, so it would actually look like a real coin. But the rest is 100% OK. Government hates everything that it cannot control.Power hungry sickness. LOL ^ (2 x n!), n -> ∞. Ok agreed, i haven't thought of that.Your arguments satisfy me for today, thank You  There is a problem with this approach.Sooner or later, when generating coins becomes too expensive in both bandwidth & processing power, network will be easily overrun by governments, botnets, crackers & other attackers with powerful connection & hardware.They will also try double spending attacks & different attacks.The problem will only get worse as there are more and more transactions. So it is better to think of a solution now, instead of cry when the crisis hits. Still, nobody can forbid using of "normal" bitcoin instead of govcoin once they put this in motion.So there will be two way exchanges between govcoin and bitcoin, exactly as it is now between fiat currencies and bitcoin. 1. I highly doubt if satoshi is working for govs2. Even if satoshi is working for government, that is a non issue because bitcoin is Open Source.It does not matter what are satoshi's motives. Open Sourcing BTC solves everything.If satoshi will be corrupted/bullied by government, we can always fork BTC ourselves. That is the beauty of OS. Interesting. This seems to be a weakness of the protocol.So after bitcoin crosses let's say 500.000 transactions per minute barrier, generating coins will be only avaiable to rich bastards with 100mbit symmetrical connections ? This is actually not so good.Also, somebody with lot of CPU/GPU power, money & bandwidth will be able to easily paralyze the network. There is a problem with that. Once BTC goes mainstream, this will happen:- 75% of people won't even notice such notice- 20% of people will, but still won't give a fuck about helping the network OR won't understand what it is about- 2% will read the notice and turn generating on, but then turn it off later and forget about it.- Remaining 3% will be either the people wanting to help the network OR miners.So IMHO it is very important to do it by default. The 75% casual computer users won't mind it. Things work this way everywhere. I like this idea.Perhaps the client should generate khashes by default, using 25% of computer's cores (or 25% power of GFX cards) ?This could strenghten the network a lot.So everybody that downloads and starts bitcoin would automatically strenghten the network. Of course generation could be easily turned off, but a warning popup saying "are you absolutely sure to do that" should show up. Also if the generation is OFF, a popup asking if You want to turn the generation on (because it strenghtens the network and is generaly advisablew) at 25% of PC's power should show every time the client is started. So producing new coins is becoming hardly worth the power needed to produce it...Exactly as predicted by satoshi.Recently I had to shut down minting on my computer completely, because my electricity bill went crazy... As somebody already said, capitalism is not the reason of Your troubles.Currently, there are almost NO capitalistic countries in the world.Canada is a demo-socialist country, and so is now Poland (i know, i come from there). The last known fully capitalistic country was probably USA in the XIX century. After that, it is only more and more socialism.However, the Poland which You escaped from, was more capitalistic than either Canada or today's Poland, which by the way perfectly explains, why You are now so poor that You have to steal to live while you had so good life in the "old" Poland.16 years ago, just after gaining independence, Poland had very small bureaucracy and was a very capitalistic country. Then came the regulations.... And it will, again. BTW:1. 1929 (Great depression) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_depression2. 1970 (EDIT: 1973) (Oil crisis) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis3. 2010 ?? ??4. Profit !Am I the only one that notices a pattern here ? A mega-crisis every 40 years perhaps ?I myself have a theory that inflationary & fiat money economy causes crisises regularly every X years, because every X years the bubble pumped by government & massive speculation has to explode. You can't pump a baloon forever, it has to blow some time.IMHO the "current" mega-crisis is either a little late, or has already started. The second is more probable.I wonder if this is the one that will end USA imperialism.EDIT:Actually, current crisis is not late at all. As the oil crisis happened in 1973, not in 1970, we should still have at least 2 years until it hits...So... 2012 ?  Did You mean: terrorism threats ?Agreed. Real players are behind the curtains. Those who can print themselves money on demand.
This is interesting. Can You elaborate ? OK.I will unmerge all my versions of Bitcoin, erase all files except the ones that are on my server and then I will check if it builds correctly again.But now i need to get out of house, i will be back in few hours. Stay tuned. It can, but i don't want to play with creating too complex stuff because something may fail.1. Are You using 32bit or 64bit Gentoo ?2. Also, have You let emerge download sources on its own, or You patched 0.3.14c source Yourself ?EDIT:I'm working on the sollution. More like moronic times. Actually, I think You got that right. Weird, i have never seen this error when building on my Gentoo...Have You used patch, or just downloaded my sources ?Also, can You post results of # ls -la /path/to/unpacked/source ? (http://www.ridenow.org/ OR http://www.avego.com/ OR http://www.flinc.org/) + Bitcoin =     This is just too much awesomness in a single point of this space-time continuum.I can't bear it, I'm gonna blow. How do people actually produce such ideas ? I don't know if sb already said that and im too lazy to check, but money itself in any form is not "evil" nor "good".It is what the people do with the money that is either good or evil. Bitcoin - because You don't need government to tell you when & what you can trade. ROTFL + 1 Truecrypt is a mighty beast and it is very easy to use.I am using it for 5 years on, and it never failed me.+ 1 to that too.However, we could do something similiar to what the topic starter is proposing.ADVERTISE bitcoin (without stating that it is not a currency) as a means of easy, charge-less internet money transfer. I'm proposing just a change in focus. Let's _focus_ on viewing bitcoin as a money transfer system, not currency.There is no lie in that. Nah, at this point nobody is willing to spend millions of dollars just to kill some "crap money transfer network" (this is how politicians will understand it probably).I seriously doubt any government will take interest in bitcoin, until it becomes mainstream, or at least half-mainstream.There are many targets which are also disruptive to current false fiat money currencies and much easier to take down (because they are centralised) - such as Liberty Reserve, Pecunix, Webmoney and so on. Today banks print (actually produce digital "numbers") money too. It is called "fractional reserve system". I don't think 1000 is too much - Bitcoin was on slashdot recently.1000 should be a perfectly understandable number. 1. Gold is money, because there is a limited supply of it and everybody wants it for some reason.2. Gold is also a commodity, because it can be used to produce other things, and can be used as consumer good/product.So bitcoins are not really a commodity like gold, but have some attributes of it though. For example, they are not completely virtual, as physical computer processing power  is required to produce them. That is an attribute of gold bullion too. Nice. That are the kind of answers i was expecting.Thank you for your effort guys. IMHO, it is both currency and commodity, because it behaves like a gold bullion. Maybe somebody is simply messing with the network using a botnet or other large scale attack ?I would like to hear Satoshi's opinion on what would exactly happen if (50% - 1) nodes of the network started to revoke the same transactions simultaneously. I mean there would be 50% - 1 "cheaters" working together, and the rest would be honest nodes.Would the network still work properly in that case ? Or perhaps would some transactions be irreversably damaged ? Would the network figure out which hash calculations to trust and which not ? You mean on the forum, in the market or what ? Only by LibertyReserve though...Why are all the hard currencies (including BTC) so hard to get ?Of course. People like to hold a lot of BTC in their wallet. If almost everybody just dumped the contents of their BTC wallets on the market at one time, the price would drop by many times.
dwdollar, please take a look this thread:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1559.0 I never said (or did I ?) that it will stop all scams.But it is MUCH better than nothing.I only wanted to create a solution which will enable re-opening of the trade websites. I have a few observations.1. It looks terrible.2. YAK ! Dark green ! This is disgusting.3. It does not look trustworthy. You really need to create a more professional image if You want people to trust You with their money.4. You are a newbie on this forum, with 17 posts, with no reputation. How are people supposed to trust You anyway ?5. Your domain name is VERY bad & unprofessional, If You're wanting to do some serious buisness with it.6. EDIT: No SSL ? Not even a non-authority-signed certificate ? What is this ? It definately looks like a scam site, i can tell You.7. Are you serious about this at all ?8. GOTO 1 Agreed, but with one adjustement:there should be a ~/.bitcoin symlink to ~/.local/share/.bitcoinNot everybody is used to the "new way" and will look for the bitcoin folder in wrong place. I would say that currency inflation encourages both wise investments and stupid investments, while currency deflation encourages only smart investments.With deflating currency it is not beneficial to take big risks while one can earn more with just keeping money in his socks.The question is: is that good or bad ? I personally think it is good, because :1. If people stop doing stupid investments, there will be less of poor people. 2. People will be able to get richer just by keeping money in a safe. So anybody can invest easily, poor & stupid people too.3. Less stupid investments = less financial crisises. So the conclusion is that difference between rich and poor will decrease. Everyone will get richer. Deflationary economy is IMHO much more stable than inflationary economy. I see that bitcoinmarket registrations are still closed, so I'm proposing a solution which should fix the paypal, moneybookers & other "soft" currencies scam problem, so the site can be opened immediately:1. Allow trading in "hard", non-drawbackable currencies (such as Pecunix, LibertyReserve, Wester Union etc.) to everybody.2. Allow trading in "soft" currencies only for users which are trusted. Trusted means:a) Are registered for 3 months or longer, or are registered & trusted nowb) Have traded at least X BTC minimum and have perfect trade history without any scams or other problemsc) Have verified their credentials through some mechanism - credit card, mail verify code delivery or personal digital signature.The solution can be composed of all a) b) and c) or their combinations.3. Force all Paypal & Moneybookers transfers to wait at least 5 days before they can be finalized. This should solve the stolen credit cards reversal problem.4. Allow paying with paysafecard and such. Idea sounds interesting, but I'd like to hear satoshi opinion on this very much.Satoshi, where R you ? That is actually quite normal for a hacker/specialist.I also try to keep away from any social-oriented sites, because they do great harm to one's privacy.Most of normal people don't realize what these sites are doing to them, so they don't care. People who know how stuff works much often avoid such risks.I am doing that myself, and many of my colleagues which are IT specialists do the same. What is put into internet just once, stays there forever. 1. We definately should not use any third-party tools for messaging.Messaging should be done only using some decentralized protocols.I mean what will happen if some company buys twitter and concludes that it should not exist and then shuts it down ?Using external services as the core of bitcoin functionality is just not safe.2. I agree with Satoshi on this - a separate protocol should be used. Perhaps another P2P protocol, or some messaging protocol like Jabber. Let's stick to the Keep It Simple Stupid (tm) rule. Well it seems I'm lucky that i read this thread to the end.I was going to donate 100 BTC to this bastard. Forgot to tell You - don't use the *-9999-* ebuilds. They never worked for me either.I'm deleting them from server. Also deleting all other irrelevant files & adjusting the Manifest.The only working ebuilds in my release are "0.3.*c" ones. Hello,I'm starting this thread to maintain my Gentoo bitcoin ebuilds for CUDA version of bitcoin.I will start a github repo later, so for now, ebuilds, patches and full sources are avaiable here:http://tinyurl.com/2ujagcwThese are simply patches from puddinpop, adjusted for the newest version and with makefiles & dependencies added.I also hope for some help from the author (puddinpop), because i don't think i can maintain this on my own for long, as I am not a C/C++ programmer, I am just good with patching & diffing.I tested it on my 64Bit Gentoo, and they compile fine, but some paths are adjusted for 64bit Gentoo, so the ebuilds may not work without small adjustments of makefile (in net-p2p/bitcoin/files/Makefile.gentoo.cuda). So if it does not compile for You on 32bit, then try adjusting these paths in the makefile:Code:CUDALIBPATHS= \ -L$(CUDAROOT)/lib64 \ -L$(CUDAROOT)/sdk/shared/lib \ -L$(CUDAROOT)/sdk/shared/lib/linux \ -L$(CUDAROOT)/sdk/C/lib \ -L$(CUDAROOT)/sdk/C/common/lib/linux/ \ -L$(CUDAROOT)/open64/libAny donations to make my effort worthwhile are welcome.1NLWBAD7ZD82fJDDawKfp5RAKSR8YWWYd3 +50 to that.KISS philosophy is what makes Linux so great. My guess is that if we don't want to be advertised as "drug dealers" and "money launderers" by all the governments, we should stay away from such a buisness. Or perhaps try to avoid doing it for at least few years, until bitcoin becomes mainstream.Of course while saying this, I'm perfectly aware of that people will do otherwise, so i don't really know if there was point in saying it at all... Actually, You're creating unnecessary theories about it. They don't accept bitcoin simply because it is a currency. And they probably do not allow exchanging any currencies on their site, except for "collecting" reasons. I think I didn't exactly understand how the system works. So if the messages would be sent together with bitcoin, they will also be permamently stored in the block chain for ages.It seems you're right, satoshi. Yeah, I'm curious of that too. I found something interesting.http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1138345/best-compression-algorithm-for-short-text-stringsThere is a small OS project on github, which does good compression of short text strings.http://github.com/antirez/smazSo we could further get the 384 bytes down to <200 or <175 bytes. I will tell You what have i just done.I clicked "quote", copied the message and pasted it in a text file. Then, i have truncated the file to 512 bytes, and EDIT: GZIPPED  it. It now takes 329 bytes.Next, i have bzipped it. Now it takes 288 bytes.Of course, there is no need for such a long message. Let's try 384 bytes. I used lorem ipsum generator from here: http://lipsum.com/Results:Code:-rw-r--r--  1 user user  384 2010-10-23 19:09 ipsum.txt (uncompressed)-rw-r--r--  1 user user  274 2010-10-23 19:08 ipsum.txt.bz2 (bzip2)-rw-r--r--  1 user user  268 2010-10-23 19:10 ipsum.txt.gz (gzip)I think that maximum ~260-280 bytes per transaction is not bad. Sure it is "not necessary" but still would be useful for people.Perhaps some people would like to keep one BTC address for some reasons.Also bigger financial institutions won't really like the idea of different account number for each transation.
Bitcoin is great, but it misses one thing that usual bank transfers have: payment title.Perhaps it should be possible to include short (<=512 bytes) message for each transaction.The message could be encrypted with public/private keys so only the receiver can see its contents.What do You think ?PS.I might be wrong, but the messages could also be used to increase randomness of hashing process by the way, couldn't they ? If not, never mind. There may be a small bubble waiting somewhere, even the hard currencies as gold and silver sometimes get overpriced by speculation.Lucky for us, bitcoin is even more deflationary than gold, silver or any bullion based currency, so it should be less suspective to price bubbles. Hey, here is an idea.How about You re-enable the registrations and just disable Paypal and Moneybookers for all new users (Only "old" userbase would be able to use Paypal & Mbookers), so no SCAMs can be made ?LibertyReserve and Pecunix are "hard" currencies as far as i know, so it is not possible to do drawbacks. Doesn't this seem logical ? Thanks, i already managed to get this information by looking at logs. Satoshi, could you tell me of what revision is this version ?I tried diff-ing the files (from SVN and from the binary package with sources), but there seems to be some kind of binary differences in the files, and they are marked as different when doing directory compare, but diff software cannot pinpoint what are the exact differences !!That is the weirdest thing i have seen in a long time.Perhaps the files from the package are encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16 or something ? In SVN, they are noticeably smaller. Keynesian economy already failed miserably many times (see the latest world crisis caused by nothing else than INTERVENTIONISM), and it will fail again.I would sooner say that fiat currency model is unsustainable. I have finally succeeded to create a working makefile.Everything emerges properly, however dependencies are not automatically solved, so the ebuild will not work on any Gentoo out of the box. It needs improvements.Also, my ebuild replaces normal bitcoin with its cuda version (as i don't know how to make separate binaries yet), so it's probably not the way it should be done anyway.I will be posting the ebuild soon together with modified source, after i start my account at github. Never mind my previous post.I've studied the code of the ebuild and i know what the @@GENTOO_CFLAGS_SSE2@@ is.This "@@GENTOO_CFLAGS_SSE2@@" gets replaced by "-DFOURWAYSSE2" by emerge, which is defined in the ebuild. If it is not replaced, something wrong is going on with the ebuild.My advice: try the older version (as it worked for me). I think You should ask this question at Gentoo Forums as it seems that Your Gentoo is misconfigured somehow.They will know why is Your SSE2 variable not set.BTW,Did You do $ env-update && source /etc/profile as root after changing your CFLAGS ?Alternatively, You may restart Your computer - that should work too. I think that Your cflags are wrong (too general). You need to set them for specifically Your processor type, so SSE2 will be detected and set.But i might be wrong.Code:CFLAGS="-O2 -mtune=i686 -pipe"declare -x CXXFLAGS="-O2 -mtune=i686 -pipe"Look at mine in comparison:Code:CFLAGS="-march=k8 -O2 -pipe"CXXFLAGS="-march=k8 -O2 -pipe"Those are set specifically for AMD64 processor with SSE2 support.Another thing is that perhaps Your processor does not support SSE2 ?You could post Your hardware specs.----EDIT:Also, here are lists for safe Gentoo CFLAGS for every Intel/AMD processor:http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Safe_Cflags/AMDhttp://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Safe_Cflags/Intel Clearly i can see that Your makefile is not reading the @@GENTOO_CFLAGS_SSE2@@ variable.Another question is, WHY.I am using exactly the same ebuild as You are and everything works. Perhaps something is wrong with Your cflags. Check make.conf. perhaps You should add processor type/architecture to the $CFLAGS variable.----You can post Your make.conf here, i will take a look at it.----EDIT: Correction, I'm not using the same ebuild as You, I'm using its older version.Perhaps something broke later ? I think that the hosts which have a lot of double spents should be added to client's ban list.First, a temporary ban list, and then a permament one.If a host improves his behavior, it may be removed from the temporary ban list. But if it keeps double spending, then it should be added to the permament one.To preserve anonymity, hosts could be indentified by public & private key or digital signature system or whatever.Also, the clients could communicate between each other to exchange their ban lists. But only if the particular clients trust each other. Some trust system/network could be developed for that. (Just thinking loud here, don't mind me). Even if it repeats exactly the same work that has been done before ? Curious. Thank for your answers, I think i get it now. Hey,As I understand, the client is doing the hashing in an organized manner, based on some counter. I mean that when i close the client, it saves the current state, so it can continue just where it left last time. Am i right ?I was wondering how often is the client doing backup of current state in its database, because in an event on sudden power failure, they client could forget where it was and waste some amount of time doing the same work twice when it is turned on later. Is that the case ? Or is the counter saved in real time ?So If I hard-reset my computer or kill the client with -9 parameter and then restart the client, will it pick up hashing exactly where it left, or will it start some stage from the beginning ?I hope i made myself clear enough, because my english surely isn't perfect. Hello,I was wondering if it would be possible to detect double spent bitcoins in the attack scenario where attacker has more than 50% of whole bitcoin network processing power ?By "detection" i also mean situations when we know which nodes of the network spent the same coins twice without knowing which one is "cheater" and which one "honest". Nope. Just give it a year or two though and then perhaps it will be stable.This software is in BETA stage for a reason. There are still unresolved matters with successful-and-easy attack scenarios.Those need to be resolved before BTC can become serious currency.There is also a question what will happen if quantum computers come into play in 5,10 or 15 years. It will either kill BTC totally (low probability) or render it useless and freeze all transactions until it is secured with quantum-computer encryption algorithms (more probably). Here You go:db_cxx.h :Code:$ find /usr | grep db_cxx/usr/include/db4.7/db_cxx.h/usr/include/db4.8/db_cxx.h/usr/include/db4.5/db_cxx.h/usr/include/db4.6/db_cxx.hdb.h :Code:$ find /usr | fgrep '/db.h'/usr/include/db4.7/db.h/usr/include/htdig_db/db.h/usr/include/db4.8/db.h/usr/include/db4.5/db.h I continued with the Gentoo ebuild approach, and got around most of the library dependencies problem.

I will contribute a CUDA ebuild, once i get the damn makefile to work.I guess perhaps this weekend.
While I'm not much of a C/C++ programmer, i will surely help in making of cuda/opengl-enabled ebuilds for Gentoo Linux.(You have my Bow) Why it is bad ? Well, i looked at the source and i didn't like it, so i took the 0.3.13 one.I have no idea what do You need. I downloaded source, patched it and **it just worked** with 0.3.13 ebuild on my Gentoo AMD64.I only changed the digests in Manifest to match added/modified files. The ebuild-9999 is bad, don't use it.I'm using a modified 0.3.13 ebuild all the time - it works for SVN rev 158 source too.Also, You need to create additional separate makefile for CUDA version, place it in the files/ directory and then put an digest entry for it in the Manifest. At least this is what i did.For me, it emerges successfully, however the CUDA header & cpp files are omitted. So i need a better makefile. Here is my Gentoo makefile, if anybody is interested.http://pastebin.com/73aFW42pAlso, i grepped all the CMake makefiles for "gpucommon.h" and "bitcoinminercuda.h". No results.So i'm not so sure the CMakefiles are going to work at all. I tried that at first, but build failed. This is the debug output i got:Code:bitcoin-svn-rev-158 # make bitcoind-- Found BerkeleyDB: /usr/lib64/libdb.so-- Configuring done-- Generating done-- Build files have been written to: /home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158[  5%] Building NVCC (Device) object cmake-bitcoind/./bitcoind_generated_bitcoinminercuda.cu.oScanning dependencies of target bitcoind[ 11%] Building CXX object cmake-bitcoind/CMakeFiles/bitcoind.dir/__/src/db.cpp.oIn file included from /home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.cpp:5:/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/headers.h:45:20: error: db_cxx.h: Nie ma takiego pliku ani kataloguIn file included from /home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/headers.h:123,                 from /home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.cpp:5:/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:26: error: DbEnv does not name a type/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:37: error: ISO C++ forbids declaration of Db with no type/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:37: error: expected ; before * token/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:39: error: DbTxn was not declared in this scope/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:39: error: template argument 1 is invalid/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:39: error: template argument 2 is invalid/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:152: error: ISO C++ forbids declaration of Dbc with no type/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:152: error: expected ; before * token/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:163: error: expected `;' before int/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:163: error: Dbc has not been declared/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:202: error: ISO C++ forbids declaration of DbTxn with no type/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:202: error: expected ; before * token/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:210: error: expected `;' before public/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:163: error: DB_NEXT was not declared in this scope/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h: In member function bool CDB::Read(const K&, T&):/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:54: error: pdb was not declared in this scope/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:61: error: Dbt was not declared in this scope(...)(...)However that approach won't work with Gentoo ebuild/emerge system, so i abandoned it.EDIT:He included GPL sourcecode in the CUDA-patch. Well i debugged the compile process a little, and concluded that i have wrong makefile, which does not include gpucommon.h/cpp and bitcoinminercuda.h/cpp, and does not convert them to objects.However, after adding them to makefile, Code:HEADERS=(...) cuda/bitcoinminercuda.h cuda/cudashared.h gpucommon/gpucommon.hall: bitcoindOBJS= \ (...)        obj/gpucommon.o \        obj/bitcoinminercuda.o, make complains that it "cannot find rules to make object. Stop."EDIT:Code:make: *** No rule to make target `obj/gpucommon.o', needed by `bitcoin'.  Stop..I know, I'm not a C++ programmer. Here it is:SVN Rev 158, patched & cmaked.However, still not working.http://www.tinyurl.pl/?KMsRtkuRMaybe somebody will figure out what i did wrong.BTW,Forget any hope that it will work under VirtualBox. No way. UPDATE:I tried everything again with bitcoind. The same results.1200khash/sec with -gpu switch, and 4700 khash/sec without (and 8500 khash/sec with -4way switch).So the client seems not to be using GPU at all.BTW,I have NVIDIA Geforce 9800GTEDIT:It would be really useful if the GPU client displayed any debugging info, because i don't even know if my card was detected, if CUDA is enabled properly etc etc. OK, now I'm confused.1. I installed the NVIDIA developer drivers2. I installed NVIDIA cuda toolkit3. I downloaded the svn rev. 158 source4. I patched the source5. I used CMAKEfiles on the source to make it buildable6. I compiled / emerged everythingAnd the result is that on GUI version i get 1200khash/sec always, it does not matter if i used -gpu, -aggresion, -gputhreads, or any other switch.It seems that the client is not working on graphics card, it is just using CPU, and single core only.Also, the client in graphics mode keeps breaking wxGTK/wxWidgets (wxWidgets often popup with some debug messages). But that is bearable.----EDIT:I guess i will try compiling only the daemon now and tell You how it went. I deleted it already and now i have to re-do it again.It may take a day or 2. Do i need to use a special version of graphics drivers to get the OpenCL client working ? Be careful, because the price for thinking that You know what exactly is going on and being wrong is terrible. I really wouldn't be surprised if government alread had working prototypes of quantum computers. If they have, bitcoin surely comes next (after decrypting russian/iran/political enemies' hard disks) in line to be busted.The main grip the govern.m-ent (read: F-E-D) has over people is the money supply. If they start to lose that grip, be sure they will invest every possible resource they have, to save it.Don't be foolish - if bitcoin really becomes a threat to them, they won't hesitate to use quantum computers (if they have them), ban bitcoin usage, ban T-O-R usage or even call a terrorist & send to g.u.a.n.t.a.n.a.m.o every single person who uses any of this technologies. Bah, they even may shut down the internet (law just for this have been passed already) just to take care of that single threat. Yes, I'm serious.EDIT:BTW,I don't know if You realize, but the hegemony of U-S-A comes mostly from controlling money supply of the world through Oil (as Oil can only be bought for dollars). They use dollars as a way of collecting tax from the rest of the world using ever-inflating currency, but that's another long story.The point is, g.ove-rnment will never, ever let anyone take that power away from them. This is even more serious than with oil. They would actually repeat it all over again: attack a country, torture & kill innocents or even kill its own citizens just to take down a threat to the d.ol-lar currency... You are not taking all circumstances under consideration..And the most important one is: QUANTUM COMPUTERS.The goverment always has everything much faster than the rest of the world (example: they had Internet at least 10-15 years before the public). Scientists currently say, that quantum computers are a matter of 10 years. So what if government is 10 years ahead of everybody else, and they have the Quantums already ?I think this possibility should be SERIOUSLY taken into consideration. Perhaps the length of bitcoin cryptographic keys should be increased 10-fold to account for that (but this won't be enough to protect us from quantums anyway, so that may be actually pointless).EDIT:However, increasing the length of crypto keys 10-fold would surely postpone the inevitable downfall of all hashes & current cryptographic algorithms in case of quantum comps are invented. That would give us bitcoiners more time to adjust & perhaps invent some defense. It seems I used the normal driver....Everything is clear now. Yeah i tried using the -gpu switch, nothing happened. Well, actually perhaps something happened - i think the speed was cut in half - i had only 2200khash/sec instead of normal 4500khash/sec or 8500 khash/sec (-4way switch).I guess then will try the new drivers tomorrow. UPDATE:I compiled it successfully using a modified ebuild.It launches and seems to generally work, but at the same speed as normal.I have 195.36.24 version of NVIDIA drivers (too old perhaps ?).I guess i will wait for the official CUDA build. Nah, still can't compile it.Successfully emerged cuda-toolkit, patched source (rev 158), used the CMake files (also a success), but compilation fails with following errors:Code:bitcoin-svn-rev-158 # make bitcoind-- Found BerkeleyDB: /usr/lib64/libdb.so-- Configuring done-- Generating done-- Build files have been written to: /home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158[  5%] Building NVCC (Device) object cmake-bitcoind/./bitcoind_generated_bitcoinminercuda.cu.oScanning dependencies of target bitcoind[ 11%] Building CXX object cmake-bitcoind/CMakeFiles/bitcoind.dir/__/src/db.cpp.oIn file included from /home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.cpp:5:/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/headers.h:45:20: error: db_cxx.h: Nie ma takiego pliku ani kataloguIn file included from /home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/headers.h:123,                 from /home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.cpp:5:/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:26: error: DbEnv does not name a type/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:37: error: ISO C++ forbids declaration of Db with no type/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:37: error: expected ; before * token/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:39: error: DbTxn was not declared in this scope/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:39: error: template argument 1 is invalid/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:39: error: template argument 2 is invalid/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:152: error: ISO C++ forbids declaration of Dbc with no type/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:152: error: expected ; before * token/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:163: error: expected `;' before int/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:163: error: Dbc has not been declared/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:202: error: ISO C++ forbids declaration of DbTxn with no type/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:202: error: expected ; before * token/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:210: error: expected `;' before public/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:163: error: DB_NEXT was not declared in this scope/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h: In member function bool CDB::Read(const K&, T&):/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:54: error: pdb was not declared in this scope/home/Bitcoin/bitcoin-svn-rev-158/src/db.h:61: error: Dbt was not declared in this scope(...)(...)Any ideas what's wrong ?I run an AMD64 Gentoo.

Indeed, it is almost 2 x as fast with -4way as it is without.I get about 8500 khash/sec with -4way, and 4500 khash/sec without.
