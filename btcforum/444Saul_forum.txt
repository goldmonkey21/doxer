Build went well. I'm getting a couple of non-fatal wxWidgets debug errors. The performance is less than half of what I got under Ubuntu, however, I'm pleased that your directions were so complete and I am now generating coins.In your directions it doesn't remind one to change the build directory in the makefile, I missed this the first time.If you are interested in the wxWidgets debug messages I would be glad to post them. This may be related: in Bitcoin there are two Apple logos, the menu is offset strangely.Thanks! Was your test machine 10.5.x or 10.6.x? Its an AMD x2 4200, custom build. Currently I have it running fine under WINE and generated my first coin within two hours!I am still working on the native, however, and am stuck while trying to build wxWidgets. I know I must be doing something wrong. Here is a copy of the script I took from the directions.Code:PREFIX=~/bitcoin/depsSRCDIR="$PREFIX/wxWidgets-trunk"BUILDDIR="$SRCDIR/macbuild"cd "$PREFIX" &&#svn checkout http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/wxWidgets/trunk wxWidgets-trunk &&cd "$SRCDIR" &&[ -f include/wx/hashmap.h.orig ] || cp include/wx/hashmap.h include/wx/hashmap.h.orig &&sed 's/if wxUSE_STL/if 0 \&\& wxUSE_STL/g' < include/wx/hashmap.h.orig > include/wx/hashmap.h &&[ -f include/wx/hashset.h.orig ] || cp include/wx/hashset.h include/wx/hashset.h.orig &&sed 's/if wxUSE_STL/if 0 \&\& wxUSE_STL/g' < include/wx/hashset.h.orig > include/wx/hashset.h &&rm -vrf "$BUILDDIR" &&mkdir "$BUILDDIR" &&cd "$BUILDDIR" &&../configure --prefix="$PREFIX" \--with-osx_cocoa \--disable-shared \--disable-debug_flag \--with-macosx-version-min=10.5 \--enable-stl \--enable-utf8 \--enable-universal_binary \--with-libjpeg=builtin \--with-libpng=builtin \--with-regex=builtin \--with-libtiff=builtin \--with-zlib=builtin \--with-expat=builtin \--with-macosx-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk &&find . -name Makefile | while read i; do   echo $i;   sed 's/-arch i386/-arch i386 -arch x86_64/g' < "$i" > "$i".new &&   mv "$i" "$i".old &&   mv "$i".new "$i"; donemake && make installAnd here is the console readout, it seems like I am missing an escape character somewhere or something.Code:admins-10:wxWidgets-trunk admin$ sh wxmake.sh: command not found: No such file or directorytcoin/deps: No such file or directorytcoin/deps: command not found: command not found: command not found : command not found : command not found : command not found : command not found : command not found : command not found : command not found mkdir: ~/bitcoin/deps\r/wxWidgets-trunk\r: No such file or directory: No such file or directoryitcoin/deps: command not found wxmake.sh: line 21: ../configure: No such file or directorywxmake.sh: line 22: --with-osx_cocoa: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 23: --disable-shared: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 24: --disable-debug_flag: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 25: --with-macosx-version-min=10.5: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 26: --enable-stl: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 27: --enable-utf8: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 28: --enable-universal_binary: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 29: --with-libjpeg=builtin: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 30: --with-libpng=builtin: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 31: --with-regex=builtin: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 32: --with-libtiff=builtin: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 33: --with-zlib=builtin: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 34: --with-expat=builtin: command not foundwxmake.sh: line 35: --with-macosx-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk: No such file or directory: command not found : command not found : command not found wxmake.sh: line 50: syntax error: unexpected end of fileI do have Xcode and the SDK is where it should be. There is something more basic I'm missing. Sorry for hijacking my own thread... I apologize for the confusion, but don't the blocks get downloaded in a p2p fashion already? What is the benefit of torrenting it? The prebuilt application does not seem to be loading in my configuration.

Before I attempt my own build, is there anyone who can shed light on this issue? Thanks.
