New release: Auroracoin 2018.09.1.0With great joy we announce a new release of the Auroracoin core wallet. It is the result of the development we have done for over a year. With this release we improved a lot of poor programmed code and improved on standardization for future development. We added support for newer versions of libraries that the Auroracoin core wallet uses, including Openssl version 1.1 and the latest version of miniupnpc, while maintaining backward compatibility for older versions. The build system also had its fair share of improvements, making building for Windows and MacOSX easier.https://github.com/aurarad/Auroracoin/releases/tag/2018.09.1.0 I don't know. This community member send me another PM explaining that Rijk is pulling a long history of "things" together and see who he can hold accountable for. It also seem to extend beyond the BCT threads.As you are closer to Rijk than I am (I assume you (can) speak to him in the Gulden Slack), I guess you can better ask him if it's fake or not. I would to love to hear his reply.As for selling all my Gulden, it is going through my thoughts the past few days. I've stopped selling weeks ago, as I do most of it through Litebit and.. well, they were in maintenance mode. But to be honest, my confidence in Gulden has reached an all-time low. So, it seems Rijk and his dad are preparing a court case and I'm askedto distance myself from RichPissman. I could put a pointless, single lineclaim here, but I don't do that, as it isn't my style. I thought I'vealways been very clear towards my stance regarding Gulden en Rijk, whichpartially overlaps with RichPissman's opinion. This is due to my historywith Rijk and Gulden in general.I have no issues with Gulden and and have said it before multiple times thatGulden in essence is a good idea and I would love to see it succeed. Yet, Idon't agree that the path chosen in the past few years is the right one.In this part I disagree with Rijk and the dev team. We had and probably stillhave different opinions about that. Also, how I saw how he managed thingsit became clear to me that he and I have quite different personalities andthose would collide. Currently, I don't see myself cooperating with him or havethe need to have Rijk as a friend.So far the things that I and RichPissman most likely have in common. My sayingsand actions come from the background described above, not because of RichPissmanor anyone else on the forum. As for the way RichPissman expresses himself, I personally would never do it insuch strong words. Again, not my style. I always try to have discussions on thesubject that is being discussed and matters, not on a person himself. Ifhowever a person does something that I don't agree with, I have the freedom ofspeech to say something about that. This person is free to respond and explainhis actions. In this I always try to respect the person himself, whether this isRijk, RichPissman or anyone else. Probleem is natuurlijk dat je ook niet echt weet wat banken precies zullen vragen.Update: Ik wacht nog steeds op een reactie van de bank. Check out this post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4937333.msg44502180#msg44502180It contains more information regarding Gulden. The rest is just derailed discussion. Nothing, that jail thing was made up by JimJimJimJim. Dude, jail time... seriously? Hint: Not every "law breaking" results in jail time. Let me tell you how it went:1) I got a PM (that mentioned RichPissman) from a member from the Gulden community threatening me legally to close the thread.2) Replied that I would think about it and that I would contact RichPissman, if he wanted to have it closed earlier he should have contacted a forum mod.3) I PM'ed RichPissman explaining the situation.4) I closed the thread. RichPissman had already opened this thread.5) PM'ed member from point 1 that I closed the thread, just like he asked me to do.No legal boundary has been crossed from my side, just (possibly fake) legal threats by a member from the Gulden community. My real ID is known on this forum and I just don't have the time to spend time on such lingering bullshit. That's why I closed the thread. To bad we had to close the previous thread. It shows that some people use legal threats to force their will. Although I have my doubts these threats are real, I'd rather not risk them. All I wanted was some decent discussion, but it seems some people can't handle that.Back on-topic... so we have our SegSig release, what can we expect next from the Devs? Well, apparently it had to come to this. I go for the alternative: Rijk sends people here from time to time to try to pull people to his slack instead of here andhave some bullshit discussion about nothing. Apparently the people in the Gulden Slack care about what's being discussedhere.@johnny As for Auroracoin, development (in my spare time) is still going strong. The fact that you can't find it... well...you're not in Iceland and you are not really interested. Now, back on-topic, Gulden. @johnnybraveau, all the "trolls" here would love to have Gulden accepted everywhere and it's price not in the gutter where it currently is. Most of them, including me, even helped Gulden at some point to get it somewhere. But most of us got tired of Rijk's bullcrap over and over again. If Rijk knows so well on how to handle this, let him do it. The only branching out was drop the focus on the Netherlands a few years ago... Shoot for the stars!!! Because we missed the moon! Did that in the past, didn't work.I wonder if that actually would work... request Bittrex to get delisted. Has any coin done that successfully in the past? Free monies, sold at profit. I just put in Openssl v1.1 support: https://github.com/aurarad/Auroracoin/commit/2ba591fa31067e7367d1872a0a0c7f135b460af5It builds, but hasn't been tested during runtime. If you want to test it, make sure you backup your wallet and perform small transactions only. I don't say that NLG and BTC should be disconnected. NLG and EUR pairing should get their shit together and be more important than NLG-BTC. But all the NLG fanboys are looking at BTC and seeing it drop, but instead of starting to buy NLG for BTC, they sell it against EUR as well. Ik ben een precedent tegengekomen van iemand die voor 1200 euro aan bitcoins verkocht had op localbitcoins (Nederlandse verkoper, Duitse koper) en de Duitse bank een melding van fraude maakte. De Nederlandse bank boekte het geld terug naar Duitsland, persoon heeft gelijk gekregen van de rechter. Natuurlijk is dit een geheel andere situatie.@friends1980, ik ben een vrij principieel persoon, maar ik stap niet direct naar de rechter. We hebben in Nederland eerst de mogelijkheid om het via de bank te regelen, vervolgens kunnen we naar het Kifid (financiÃ«le klachten organisatie), daarna kunnen we alsnog naar de rechter. Dat goed huisvaderschap hebben we hier echter helaas niet, onze regering zegt gewoon "zorg maar dat je de 4% haalt, alles boven de 43.000 euro (inclusief crypto's) betaal je belasting over".Gisteren belde de klantenservice van de Triodos bank op met wat vragen. De vriendelijke vrouw aan de lijn was dus nog niet op de hoogte van mijn mail, dus de hele situatie (nogmaals) uitgelegd en gezegd dat de interne communicatie behoorlijk slecht is. Aangezien ze niet echt voldoende voorbereid was op mijn gesprek kwam ze eigenlijk niet verder dan "wij zijn een duurzame bank en bitcoins zijn niet duurzaam" (niet in die woorden, maar tussen de regels bedoelde ze dit wel). Ze was een beetje stil over mijn situatie en argumentatie waarom ik deed wat ik aan het doen was. Daar was ze een beetje stil van. Uiteindelijk wilde ze volgens mij alleen bellen om te vragen waarom ik dergelijke grote bedragen naar Knab en Bunq overgemaakt had en of die bitcoin-gerelateerd waren. Het antwoord was natuurlijk dat ze mijn rekening op gaan heffen en het geld ergens heen moet.Vooralsnog geen email bevestiging van mijn mail gehad (normaal krijg ik wel geautomatiseerde bevestiging van ontvangst), misschien nog maar eens mailen om te vragen of de mail goed ontvangen is. This has NOTHING to do with marketing or not. Some people asked here why Litebit is in maintenance mode for the past few days, I contacted them and this was their reply. So I contacted Litebit regarding their Gulden wallet being in maintenance for a few days now, their reply in Dutch:In English: they are having issues regarding integrating it with their own systems and are in close contact with the Gulden development team to find a solution. No indication regarding when it will be back up again.
Ik ben in 2010 begonnen met crypto's, banktransacties heb ik, maar wat in de cryptowereld heeft plaatsgevonden in die tijd is al vaak niet meer te herleiden, zeker in het begin. Een aantal van mijn eerste aankopen zijn via MtGox en bitcoin-central gegaan, beide exchanges bestaan niet meer. Ik bedoel, zou jij een gedetailleerde administratie bijhouden voor een gimmick die 10 cent kost (paar honderd euro's ertegen gooien, niets serieus), niet wetende dat 7 jaar later dit enkele miljoenen waard is. Zelfs 2 jaar gelden zou de bitcoin koers van nu onrealistisch gevonden zijn. Ik ben 6 maanden met Triodos bezig geweest om dat duidelijk te maken. ALLE aan- en verkopen zijn via die rekening gelopen. Ik heb iedere individuele bank transactie voor ze opgezocht, berekend hoeveel crypto's dat waren en een overzicht gemaakt van: dit is erin gegaan, dit is de waarde nu, dit is eruit gehaald. Wat eruit is gehaald is minder dan de waarde nu. Zelf gaven ze ook niets aan of ze meer informatie wensten, dus ging ik ervan uit dat het wel goed zat. Aan de andere kant, als ze het werkelijk niet vertrouwden zouden ze dit ook bij de FIU-NL moeten melden en de rekening blokkeren i.p.v. opheffen. Mijn vermoeden is dat het gewoon "ongemakkelijk" voor hen is en zich dus achter de DNB verstoppen.Daarnaast is natuurlijk ook de hoogte van het bedrag dat meespeelt. Ik had weer een medewerker van Knab aan de telefoon gisteren, die zei dat als het bedrag hoger wordt je sneller in de spotlight komt. Van de banken die "geen problemen geven", hoe vaak gaat het over bedragen tot een paar duizend euro?De reactie van Knab was dat ik alvast de rekening kon openen, maar wel nog door de "compliance afdeling" zal moeten vanwege de hoogte van het bedrag dat op de rekening terecht gaat komen. Mogelijk dat ze vandaag nog terug zullen bellen.Ook heb ik de Triodos bank toch even een klachtenmail gestuurd met het verzoek om het opheffen te stoppen, inclusief een hele lijst argumentatie. Als mijn eis geweigerd wordt, kan ik nog altijd kijken of ik het bezwaar nogmaals via Kifid kan indienen, al is het maar om jurisprudentie te genereren.Bottom line advies: scheid je crypt/bank-transacties rekening van je huishoudelijke rekening. Banken zeggen wel dat crypto's onbetrouwbaar en risicovol zijn, maar hieruit blijkt dat banken ook een risico vormen. I agree things need to balance out, but the long term locking is a big risk that currently gives no guarantee of being very profitable. It all depends on the percentage, not on market price (which is also uncertain by itself and three years is long-term in terms of market (and coin) development, a lot could happen in that time). I think you can even better interests (about 1% for 5 years, guaranteed) at saving depositos already, no need to wait 3 years for banks to increase their savings interest.Sure, one would made now 7%, but that could easily change over time. And like you said, if witnessing becomes more popular be sure that the interest goes down. Tsja, ik heb nu een plan opgesteld. Een rekening bij de ABN AMRO (die ik ook nog had) voor gewone huis-, tuin- en keukenbetalingen, waarop ik niets van crypto's ga uitbetalen. Contact gehad met Knab en uitgelegd wat het probleem is, die zouden het intern gaan overleggen, woensdag hoop ik daar meer over te weten. Bunq rekening geopend om in de toekomst wat uitbetalingen op te storten, maar het meeste op de (Nederlandse) exchange laten staan. Daarnaast ga ik ook nog bij andere banken nog een rekening openen om hetgeen een beetje te spreiden en als back-up.Reden van de uitbetalingen is omdat een substantieel deel van mijn vermogen in crypto's zit (door de toename over de jaren, sinds 2010), wat ik wil verlagen tot rond de 10% en omdat op gegeven moment ook de belasting wat wil hebben (en crypto's accepteren ze niet, dus moet je het omzetten naar euro's). I thought the official ANN is the place for moderated discussion? Not? Oh wait, it was locked because nobody wanted to moderate it?Anyway, everyone is open to give positive sounds about Gulden here and a few community members do that. If you want only positive sounds, there is the Slack as well. So, what does the new thread really try to achieve? Shee... I wonder what kind of tips one would get... would be something like "Get on <some big bitcoin exchange>", "Martketing" and "Don't scare away whales"... neh. Another problem with Bittrex is that orders are automatically and silently removed after 4 weeks, no way to build long term support without an actively trading community there. Daarvan was ik niet op de hoogte. De uitbetalingen zijn echter via een Nederlandse exchange. Het is een van de grotere "groene/sociale" banken van Nederland. Twitter heb ik niet, betwijfel het ook of het veel zal helpen.Ik denk dat de meeste grote banken het gedogen zolang de bedragen niet te hoog worden, blijkbaar ben ik voor hun over die grens gegaan.Ik zag bij knab het volgende staan:Iemand hier ervaring mee? Sinds afgelopen december ben ik, op mijn initiatief, met mijn bank (Triodos) in de weer geweest om duidelijkheid te verschaffen m.b.t. verkoop van mijn bitcoins en altcoins. Dit resulteerde in maart tot een tijdelijke blokkade van mijn rekening (zonder waarschuwing), maar sindsdien heb ik alle gegevens m.b.t. aan- en verkoop van de coins, sinds 2010, en belastingaangiftes e.d. verstrekt aan hun. Dus dat zat wel goed dacht ik.Nu valt net een brief in de bus dat ze over twee maanden mij rekening opheffen vanwege dat zij niet kunnen achterhalen waar de bitcoin transacties vandaan komen (in het verleden aangekocht, nu gedeeltelijk verkocht; aangegeven met aankoop waarde en huidige verkoopwaarden). Dus, over twee maanden is mijn betaalrekening weg.Naar een hoop gevloek en getier (ik wilde alleen eerlijk en duidelijk zijn, om problemen te voorkomen), sta ik dus voor een dilemma. Wat moet ik hiermee? En zijn er banken waar ik beter bij terecht kan? Is er ook iemand die iets vergelijkends meegemaakt heeft? That's paid through the shares, not the premine. Nope, there is sufficient funds on my bank account for the next few years. Maybe I just want to buy now that the price stays so low. Nope, that's tax evasion and there is a fine for that when de Belastingdienst finds out. Below 42.000 euros you should be fine though. Anyone an idea when Litebit takes Gulden out of "wallet maintenance" mode? Been a few days now. I didn't burn the pre-mine (never got hold of that). The original, anonymous dev did that. He is as much as a scam developer as Satoshi, read: he/she isn't.Back to NLG.Accountability of the pre-mine is one thing and Rich already mentioned its influence on market development... and than there is still the tax situation. If Rijk is holding those in person this means he has to pay roughly 310.000,00 euro taxes for the pre-mine over 2017. Locked witnessing funds also are income tax accountable, so Dutch people should watch out with this. Rijk has no power over my actions... I banned myself. I had that view in the past as well, but in the years I've seen that Satoshi was mistaken in a few points, some have been corrected, some repaired in a flawed way and some not. If you want to keep it "pure to the original whitepaper", there is BitcoinCash. EFL started as a scam coin and hasn't recovered since... have those missing EFL already surfaced, or are they still in the pocket of the original scammer? Only 1.7million? How good would look your "money flowing in" if that goes 10x?[edit]Oh, euro, not NLG. That's a bit more impressive.[/edit] Shops accepting NLG would potentially have lost revenue.
Still, the "testnet" is artificial, independent of how more advanced it is than anything else. Some case slipped through it and bit Gulden's users in the ass, which shouldn't have.  Was this really a problem with Gulden?Â  Most miners from Gulden are already members within the community (for the mining industry Gulden isn't profitable). Witnessing is still dependent on mining, mining still dictates when witnesses come into play. I know a bit about software development myself. I also know that the "testnet" as present in many coins (including Gulden) is artificial. It's good for one stage of testing, but afterwards you'll have to test it again in an separate main network (few VPSes that only connect to each other would suffice). Many dev teams don't really care that they are operating in a million dollar market, where downtime of a few minutes could potentially cost users millions. Banks have the same problem with this and crypto could solve that, if devs only would care that they are playing with people's money if they make changes to the consensus network.I've earned my money with crypto. No need for me to have Gulden be successful in a financial term. I want Gulden to be successful in a way that Bitcoin was made to do, but has not being able to get there. Gulden has/had a better chance for that, but everyone is looking only at their own finger instead of where it points to. Wow, the perfectly tested update didn't trigger perfectly.  Never go full in, never go full out. If it moons, it will crash at some point again.A bit more action on the markets would be nice though, this is boooooooring! Yeah, development is mostly only on my plate. The new client will mostly be code restructuring (for future development) and being able to be build with recent toolchains. The wallet/coin works and the blockchain runs smoothly, so no really new, sexy features. Speaking of which, how's Pandacoin (the coin that he worked on before) doing these days? That was march, but I moved since then, so no new date planned. The moving caused more time of being out of the running than I expected. Also some parts of my build environment updated since then, which caused me to make some changes to the code again (which I did last week). It builds again now on my dev system, but I need to update the Windows build environment and test the updated code on my MacOSX environment. Hmm... all those desperate posts... 100 sat. here we come! We had some development until start this year, check the "Development" branch. It just hasn't been released yet. BTC is going to increase so much that all the locked NLG cause not enough sell power to drop it further. :-D Because you can make a nice profit with trading. Marketing angels have been shot down by the dozen over the past few years. As for increasing value, not in it's current implementation. The reward drop was removed and replaced with a single drop to 0 in a long time to go. The ECB is reducing the flow of new money into the European market... Gulden just keeps printing. That's why you have to market it, not to get the ICO crowd on board, but to Henk and Ingrid so they can spend it at stores. I'm not a marketing guy, but even I can understand this. This sponsoring of that gocart dude is nice, but without some solid backup it's pissing away money. Months of postponing because it needed to be tested into perfection... nuff said. Rijk didn't find him... He is a cousin(?) of WaterLooDown. Deadlines have been missed before (shouldn't this have been released months ago?). Let's see what gets released first.<edit>Lots of dumping on Bittrex... Traders aren't biting I guess.</edit> Would have been nice if he used the quote tag. ;-) Why are they giving ETH away? No faith in their own coin? If you would have lookup up his mugshot on the site of the company that he works for you wouldn't have made such dumb assumption.Seriously, the word "apartheid" comes from that country, which should give you a clue that not everyone has the same skin colour.
Of course you can keep it non-moderated, as you are unable to put it on moderated any way. Too bad that order will be cancelled by Bittrex before it will be filled. Lol... sign up in Slack (if that's even possible for me) to get immediately kicked out again? My time is worth more than that. Invest... in what exactly? Promises that will be ready when they are ready? I've put enough money into NLG in the past, but am still unable to pay with it at the local supermarket after how many years now? The longer the price stays low, the harder it gets to rise the price. Lots of dumping now and when the price rises 10%, trader that buy now now are going to cash out. A small rally crashes back to where it came from. Looking at Bittrex and ISX, I would say about 500K AUR are on the market, up for sale in the order books. Basically a number of things are going on:- Cryptos are in downtrend after the rally last year.- Adoption of Auroracoin in Iceland is slower than initially expected.- The reformation of the Auroracoin foundation to a Crypto foundation probably has caused some panic among people.- From the beginning Auroracoin has been put "on the market" wrongly. See the initial article in the Steemit link that describes this. So, I'm away for a few weeks and things get dramatic over here... here is something that cheered me up:https://steemit.com/auroracoin/@saunter/fjm3qx6lActual purchases with Auroracoin! It just works! Come on RichPissman, 18 hours ago was the latest development update. They updated Readme.md, that's at least worth one year of development time. ;-) Probably not, maybe contact to ask them what's going on. Their wallet should just work. So, overpriced, restricted and lots of fanboys? :-D I would not worry about those coins. I think the Cryptsy wallet was already dumped out 2 years ago, I caught most of those coins then. We had a new wallet to be released, but due to personal situations it will be postponed until end of May at least.Things seem to be going along in Iceland. Maybe someone from there can give some more details. Noooo... Gulden does not copy other coins to get hyped into the top 50! It's reinventing the wheel by itself. No need for rushing. Dipped shortly below 1 USD and 100 ISK... now back up again due to the current rally. I think it is more due to BTC being a bit more higher lately. ZOMG!!! NLG has 400 active users that weren't kicked out of slack! :-D Wait... what? I'm not a Gulden developer. 1) Take price of a year ago.2) Extrapolate.3) Profit!Every coin has gone up in price in 1) due to BTC was rising compared a year ago and they base their price in USD, that's the reason you won't find any coin crashing.
I don't use it myself, so I can't answer that. Maybe @ltex can answer it. Try to PM him. Cash zou ik nog doen, de rest is me teveel moeite voor wat het oplevert (of aandacht verdient).Ik zou eerst in ieder geval de bitcoins die aan die keys hangen op een andere key onderbrengen, aangezien je informatie over de keys vrijgeeft als je zo'n fork spendeert. Het laatste wat je wilt is dat een fork je bitcoins afhandig maakt. Ook wallet in principe niet meer gebruiken. yep, we are aware of that issue. NLG broke its mid-term downtrend? Seems little resistance to 3000 sat. Would be nice if that could reach that, though I don't have much confidence in that.<edit>Just checked Litebit. Last week they had 30 million NLG in stock, now only 13,4 million NLG is left. That's about 16,6 million NLG sold.</edit> Het internet is ook sinds enkele jaren tot een bepaald niveau gereguleerd (op iemands computer inbreken is strafbaar). Dat was ook geen belemmering.Zelf ben ik niet tegen regulering, aangezien het ook duidelijkheid, rechten en plichten geeft over het hoe en wat (voornamelijk m.b.t. banken en de belastingdienst). Wat echter NIET gedaan moet worden is een algemeen verbod op crypto's of andere te strikte regelgeving. Dat zou de baby met het badwater weggooien zijn. Let me repeat that.If you don't know what sarcasm is... Google is your friend. Sure they already made that clear months ago, but at some point they need to start with step 1. Well, that statement is new than, I guess. <sarcasm>Wow, jees... at this speed we have 15 new features promised for Gulden 2.0 in 2023.</sarcasm>Seriously, any date mentioned when we can expect this all? Eth is deflationary, of course it can only go down on long term. Does anyone know if there are API libraries (preferably Python for me) available for these decentralized exchanges? I've shortly looked at DEX, but it seems to only have a web interface where I would need to trade manually. I'd rather build a bot that does it for me. Normally I don't care if the market goes up or down... I just trade for profit, which is possible in both markets. It was already good to be in fiat for two months. Much air has been released since then, maybe more than the coming two months, but who knows.@CryptoObserver, I think fiat exchanges CAN provide some level of stability, but if people still keep watching the BTC price and see it drop, somehow they get the idea that the fiat-traded cryptos also NEED to go down and start panic selling. Some part is arbitrage though, but I doubt that is the case with NLG. Tsja, bitcoin wordt meer waard gedurende het jaar, je vermogen groeit dus ook, dus betaal je ook meer vermogensrendementheffing. Niet bepaald rocket science.De belastingdienst wil bij de aangifte alleen euro's weten. Dus neem gewoon een realistische koers, reken het om, zet het in box 3 en het programma rekent uit wat je kwijt bent. (Als je met dezelfde waardes uit komt, zit je goed).Voor 2018 is het al handig om de euro's die je kwijt gaat zijn al apart te zetten, indekken als BTC sterk en lang omlaag gaat.

Zelf kijk ik zelf altijd op 1 januari op CMC, gebruik die waarde (rond ca. 0:00). Als de BD gaat klagen moeten ze maar zelf met rekenkoersen komen. Keep in mind that it seems not much is happening with AUR. Things are mostly done in our target market (Iceland). Purchasing all AUR available by some whale is something I've always been against, but had a few occasions I had to purchase a lot to keep the price stable. I also not HODL those. Big price fluctuations have been proven very bad for acceptance (in any direction) and it has been challenging to counter that. Building economic stability is, what AUR needs to be doing and that is what it does.AUR does not need to be "innovative" in terms of block chain tech. This does not make it sexy, but it works and does it's thing.You might compare it to EFL, but IMHO it's nothing like that. I've never taken EFL very serious.Now, back on topic! Please discuss other coins in their respective threads. So you can't find any valid points for a normal discussion, than we just start blaming others? Â If you post "facts" get them straight.I only joined Auroracoin AFTER I left the Gulden fan base. I was looking for something in a crypto and Gulden changed into something that didn't allow me to do that. With Auroracoin I could just do that. Like I said before, I still hope Gulden will succeed in mass adoption in the Netherlands. So if I spread FUD, point me to that, instead of attacking me (and Martin) personally. Yet, most of those things that you might consider FUD is just a (for me) realistic opinion, if you have points against them, post those.As for Auroracoin, it works and it's getting used. Our price development is also far more solid than Gulden's, with larger increase on yearly basis (x10 compared with x4 for USD). The large volatility we experience since December is due to BTC, but still in uptrend. NLG is in downtrend. Right, just this. It's a bear market in the cryptos. And as most coins have their price based on BTC, most coins drop as hard as BTC. NLG is no different, this shows most people still value NLG based on BTC price instead of EUR.
I doubt this will have effect for more than a week. So, I spend some time on looking how GPU mining worked again (I'm not really a miner myself) and agree that some tutorials would be helpful.Mining-wise Auroracoin works similar as mining Digibyte. Here is already some links to get you started:https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/guides/how-to-mine-digibyte/https://steemit.com/digibyte/@wessel/how-to-mine-digibytehttps://github.com/sgminer-dev/sgminerÂ  <= development on that seems to halted thoughIf these things are unfamiliar to you, I suggest to start pool mining and not solo mining. The links above describe that.I'll see if time allows me to write up some tutorials soon. Nice picture. Let's see what the price does when BTC stops dropping, BTC price is slowly increasing.The change in emotion is funny to watch, though. Things look already desperate for quite some time.If devs and relatives would be buying NLG, that would actually be a good thing, as it consolidates the price and they actually put their money where their mouth is at. I would be more concerned if they wouldn't be buying their own stuff. It started as that, but the devs have let that loose and now target the world? Or was it only Europe? Any way, they should have stick to the Netherlands. Try to get mass adoption there first, that's hard enough in itself. As some of the readers here know, I co-develop a coin as well. Our communication is also lacking, but if someone has valid questions I'm always making a few minutes free to answer them. It's not that difficult. Left / right are more economic terms, which he does not give any insight to (and personally, I don't care for that in a crypto). The crypto community was in the past mostly left oriented (in the past, Gulden had an UBI (Universal Basic Income) initiative in the Netherlands), but this has shifted in the years. I've always been open on that Gulden itself is a good thing. I just don't agree with the current course of the dev team. I have peace with that. This is a non-moderated thread, and I intend to keep it that way. People are free to voice their own opinions and facts, always check those facts yourself.If you're looking for the thread from the Gulden developers, you can find it here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1577392More will follow here, when I see fit. I already opened a new one, to continue: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3116357.0 Follow up from thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1495990.0As messy as it looks, I don't agree with you. This thread just shows nicely the psychology around Gulden, which is key in answering the question you set in the first post. I'm not sure to what things you point to about false information, because that's not the same as what some people don't want to hear, Accusations against Rijk and the Gulden team... well, they are grown up enough to defend themselves, no need to nanny them. Did they ask you to intervene, because their egos couldn't stand the free discussion we're having here?If they would come here and answer questions that people have, we could maybe have a nice conversation here (I think we are all interested in some more in-depth information here). Yet the team decides to hide in their ivory tower because it seems to be afraid for critique.If this thread closes, another one will start. I'm sure of that.<edit>I just did that.</edit> Welcome,In general mining AUR is not really different than other coins and there have been plenty of tutorials written on getting GPU mining going on Auroracoin.Just use Google. Keep in mind Auroracoin uses 5 different algos, 2 are not suitable for GPU mining (SHA256D and Scrypt), Groestl-myr is a maybe (I heard there are asics for that algo now as well), Qubit and Skein should be ok.In short:1) Get the right GPU drivers for your card(s)2) Install mining software.3) Install the daemon wallet and setup the RPC interface*.4) Configure output address, the algo (GPU settings could be tweaked, but normally you should start that when it is successfully running) and the RPC interface of a daemon wallet.5) Run.* Do note that this is can be a security issue when not properly setup. Setting it up on the same system as the mining software is recommended. Also, the wallet needs to be fully synced.You could setup solo mining, but my advice is to start looking for a sufficiently large pool. It makes it much more easy and quicker to setup, especially when you're just starting with mining. Rijk inspires people:https://twitter.com/CryptoXL_NL/status/973088370602790912:-D Niet echt... iedereen zit te wachten op de nieuwe release, maar het dev team is niet echt duidelijk wanneer dat nu eens gaat komen. Seriously... people are dumping because of the lack of a screen cap? NLG just works and has a large list of stores that accept it. This is the key selling point of NLG, not some magic fairy dust tech that is looking for an issue to solve. That bold part was what I added. He took money that he wasn't supposed to use for buying cryptos, now he asks if he should pour more money into it (which he clearly hasn't got, because that got him in that problem in the first place). Did you actually read what I said? Got money to spare? Maybe pay back the debt to your ex first. Seems like we've reached a new low since the start of the year. Hmm... every coin makes those calculations... fun to do, but say little. Let's assume 0.1% of the European market makes use of Gulden, what would its price be than? I think that would be a more interesting calculation. ;-) https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=18/03/03/1943233 Hmm... are you sure? (This isn't the first time that this "coin" hits the news with "fixed flaws".)Seriously, there are at least 6 or 7 coins in the top 20 that I would not trust my money to.And if you're in it to make more money, well, you can do that with almost any coin (some of themore suitable ones aren't even in the top 20).
Because it needs to be perfect*! This counts for all their software.* "Perfect" is a moving target, so it will never be reached. Ja, dat was het trust systeem. Aan de andere kan vind ik het dan ook niet meer dan mijn verantwoordelijkheid om gewoon goede posts te belonen, dingen die iets toevoegen. Ik las ook dat het systeem mogelijk een "erosie"-functie heeft, waar over tijd je kleine hoeveelheden merits verliest als je niet meer actief bent. Deze schijnt nog niet actief te zijn, maar denk dat dat op den duur wel nodig is. Ook om het probleem van oude posts met inactieve gebruikers op te lossen, No whitepaper (these things weren't that common when Auroracoin was created). It's a so-called country coin. Main goal is to have it for mass adoption in Iceland.There is currently no real roadmap, things are more or less developed as we see fit for our goal. Alive and kicking. Zelf heb ik vorig jaar genoten van het af en toe kijken naar de vogeltjes op de webcams van Beleef de Lente (Vogelbescherming). Mijn favoriet toen was de ijsvogel, maar die cam is momenteel nog niet actief. Momenteel ben ik voornamelijk naar de cams van de slechtvalk aan het kijken, daar gebeurt momenteel het meest.Zijn er hier nog anderen die deze cams volgen?Link: https://www.vogelbescherming.nl/beleefdelente/ And that's the reason who HODL is such bad strategy. If they would be liquid, price would correct quicker and the friend just bought a very expensive Flapdrol. Ik ben vandaag pas eens in dit systeem gaan kijken (en al wat merits weggeven)... het is eigenlijk wel een zinvol systeem. In het verleden is er iets soortgelijks geweest, maar dat werd toen zwaar misbruikt. There is a lot of "baked air" in there. Especially with coins that don't have a fiat pairing. Coins that can be bought only by crypto share their value with those other cryptos. They don't add up, like CMC wants you to believe. That's a big major flaw of CMC.Example, simplified, You buy a BTC for 1 euro (BTC value 1 euro), now you use this BTC to buy one CoinX. CMC will both give 1 euro as value (total market cap is 2), while only 1 euro was actually spend. Do you think we will let everyone come here without a job or some sort of income? If that would be the case, the country would be flooded with people needing financial support (social securities) without any benefit to the society itself. I think most countries have such rule.The exception to this is people who are hired by an already existing company or institute (need to show working contract), or refugees (need to proof that their reason of seeking asylum). In both these cases, people are expected to return to their own country when the work ends or their reason for asylum is not valid any more.Another exception are people from the EU (free movement of goods, people and work between countries) You know what will be the most funny thing... when this update is finally released and the price will continue to go down...  If you want to come here to sit trading at home the whole day, expect to bring a bag of money (I think the minimum was about 200k euros, not sure though) and you will most likely be required to setup a company (and get an official income from that, you also need to pay taxes, need various insurances). Else there is little chance to get a staying permit. You will most likely be required to learn about Dutch culture and required to learn the language.Do note that Dutch banks are not happy with opening a bank account (you'll will be needing one) if you're involved with cryptos and that you might be required to hand over proof where the cryptos come from (they can suddenly block your account, freezing all funds in there).Visiting the country as a tourist is one thing, living here is another. Hier wat algemene tips, die bij mij goed werken en eigenlijk gewoon basiskennis is:Klein beginnen en niet bang zijn geld te verliezen (gebruik dan ook niet meer dan je kan missen (ook als het noodlot toe slaat), ga uit van 100% waardeverlies in het ergste geval).Ga nooit 100% in crypto of fiat zitten. Houd altijd iets achter de hand, mocht een kans op snelle winst zich voordoen.Goede spreiding in meerdere muntjes is aan te raden. Ga vooral in het begin niet meteen daytraden, dat is heel erg stressvol; middellange (maanden) tot lange termijn (jaren) is makkelijker om succesvol in te zijn, winsten zijn dan misschien niet zo goed als succesvol daytraden, maar winst is wel een stuk zekerder te behalen. Mensen scheppen graag op met hoeveel procent winst ze hebben gehaald, negeer dat (ook mensen die pretenderen veel tradingkennis te hebben, de meeste hebben dat niet en hebben niet meer kans om winst te maken dan het bekijken van een glazen bol). Als mensen je proberen een muntje te laten kopen, wees argwanend, waarom willen ze dat? Meestal om aan jou te verdienen.Neem TA in crypto's met een korrel zout,Doe je eigen onderzoek naar een muntje (dit kost tijd), voordat je erin investeert. Niet luisteren naar de fanboys hier op het forum.Wees niet emotioneel, maar lees wel de emoties van anderen. Gebruik de emoties van anderen als je voordeel. Is er een mooie winst? Pakken die winst! Het is meestal te mooi om waar te zijn, je wilt niet te lang HODLen om nog meer winst te behalen met het risico de winst die je eigenlijk al hebt te verliezen. Ook de bitcoin wiki heeft veel informatie m.b.t. de onderliggende technieken. Vooral de handelsplaatsen buiten Nederland zijn een groot risico. Je hebt er 0,0 procent zicht op wat ze doen en als het mis gaat is het verdomd lastig, kostbaar of zelfs onmogelijk om juridisch je gelijk te halen. Ik heb m'n investeringsstrategie voor crypto's hierdoor afgelopen jaar aangepast. Ik ben sinds 2010 met crypto's bezig. In het begin hield ik niets bij (wie had ooit gedacht toen dat iemand meer dan 1000 euro voor een bitcoin zou neertellen), maar heb wel jaarlijks gewoon in box 3 aangegeven (toen het boven de belastingvrije voet kwam). Afgelopen jaar contact met een belastingadviseur opgenomen (aangezien het cryptovermogen in de miljoenen ging lopen). In mijn situatie kwam naar voren: gewoon in box 3 aangeven (eventueel in iets lagere waarde vanwege "waarde economisch verkeer" (verkoop van crypto's kan de waarde doen verminderen, zeker als je veel van een bepaald muntje bezit en orderboeken kleiner zijn)). De aankooptransacties (in euro's van de bank) heb ik recentelijk moeten achterhalen (bank heeft recentelijk mijn betaalrekening geblokkeerd), samen met de koers destijds kon ik een schatting maken van hoeveel muntjes het waren.Van handelen op de exchanges, wat ik sporadisch doe, houd ik eigenlijk niet bij. Veel van de exchanges die ik in het verleden gebruik heb bestaan ook niet meer (gehackt, gestopt).Alles onder een ton, zou ik alleen aan- en verkopen via de bankrekening bijhouden (tenzij je heel actief handelt en onverklaarbare vermogensgroei krijgt), daarnaast, meer bij houden is altijd beter. Boven een ton is een belastingadviseur aan te raden. Mijn kosten om het door een fiscalist uit te laten zoeken waren iets van 150 euro (op een ton een verwaarloosbaar bedrag). Zij doen dit jaar ook mijn aangifte, aangezien zij ook directe lijntjes met de belastingdienst hebben.<edit>Bewijzen aanleveren is lastig, aangezien dit ook niet door de belastingdienst zelf aangegeven wordt. Belastingadviseur zei, in mijn geval, bankafschriften en overzicht vermogensgroei (dan wel jaarlijks aangeven op de inkomstenbelasting!) zou voldoende moeten zijn. In dat geval zou je mogelijk ook de bewijslast kunnen omdraaien en zal de belastingdienst zelf moeten aangeven waarom je gegevens niet kloppen (ook weer waar die korte lijntjes bij helpen).</edit> Funny to see all the emotion flip from "It's dying! Rijk is ...." to "Moon! Heil Rijk!"... just by some news post. #showusthecodeLike, half of that news could have been posted a month (or two) ago... communication is still bad. https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2018/02/23/first_bitcoin_atm_machine_in_reykjavik_introduced_a/Still not sure what to think of this... If you want centrally regulated markets... there is another world for that. Inside information and market manipulation are as old as cryptos are. Learn to live with that. You failed investing 101. NEVER spend money you need. But, now you learned the hard way. strataghyst is the user you're looking for.
Should normally not be a problem. Maybe contact the pool owner. So, testing for a few months now... and now they come with "It is extremely complex and must be perfect"?Seems like they found fundamental, exploitable flaws in their idea. A few years ago he was appointed as community manager... Haven't heard much from him since like... 2-3 years? He is a cousin of MaNi (he brought MaNi on board). Low? We're still up in both BTC and fiat price on any time scale over 1 month. We also didn't drop when bitcoin (and virtually every other alt) crashed in the past month. PnD isn't what we're after, just steady economic build up on long term scale. Or... call it ripping NLG from weak hands... ;-) I follow EUR (or USD for that matter) price. The BTC price is much more difficult to make predictions about, as BTC is volatile as hell and EUR price seems to be leading over BTC price (due to the fiat exchanges) as could be seen in the fast few months. EUR/USD price has been pretty stable for the past few weeks, suggesting a consolidation phase.  Just like the bloodbaths in August and November last year?... Checks chart again in an attempt to find them. This has nothing to do with rules and restrictions, but more with moral and social values... like being free to ask questions as you see fit and expect a civilized answer. I've met enough millennials that you could have a good talk with, some are just... "pretty precious exceptions". There, fixed that for you. ... with some extra boost to speed things up. Does anyone actually look further than that number that says hardly anything? Did anyone notice NLG is actually consolidating? So, it seems everything is going into calm waters. Even TA shows BTC is heading into consolidation phase. New opportunities to push Auroracoin value higher as our current value seems pretty consolidated now. Yeah, thought the same... even euro price can't keep up... steadily dropping... and that with Euro exchanges that have more than 50% market share. It's a bit like everyone is watching bitcoin drop and thinks "NLG price should be lower as well" So, I requested if I could go through basic verification again (with some document proof), but that was not possible. Enhanced verification is the only thing I could do to get my funds back. I consider these funds lost. Closed my ticket #1109359, With all the blood in the crypto streets... AUR performed quite well. I think strataspool has Myriad-Groestl. And here is the reply from Bittrex:Seriously? Just... wow. Meh... not like these issues with the dev team are new or so...  So, finally got a reply after two days. Their answer, go through verification and than we can close your account. WTF? The verification process is why I want to close my account in the first place. Know how you're feeling, bro. If you're in for it for a long time, you've made some profit from it. Just sell a bit that you feel comfortable with, stash the rest for a bunch of years.
Nope, hasn't been running on NLG for ages.  Uninformed people watching uninformed tv program... and nothing of value was lost. Most new people hardly understand the whitepapers and are easily convinced them being correct (and even if they are correct, there is no proof that the group that announced them is the group that wrote it, as I heard that you can buy them for a few bucks).  If you're in it for short term profits, I agree that's a good strategy. I'll be waiting until the consolidation phase has been reached (wherever that is).Just checked the #Gulden twitter... panic is starting to surface there... more than the "Hallelujah... moon!!!"-posts. Looks like uninformed people are starting to loose money... again. That dip we're seeing could very well be loose hands that were buying massively >0.20EUR. Sure, MtGox played a role... but IMHO more as reason for it to go down in the first place... the long time for correction can't be attributed to that alone. At the time we also had China government officials FUDing about making bitcoin illegal. That had more of an impact than MtGox. Seems like it, I'll notify the person responsible for it later today. Sorry, as far as I know there is no replacement being set up at the moment. I think $8k for BTC is way too conservative... last time it "corrected" it went from ~1200 USD to ~230 USD, which took over a year (yes, Cryptos react THAT slow). Consolidation phase took another few months before it found its way back up. Based on the previous corrections I would not be surprised if BTC would go down to $2k, but the thing with these long corrections is that a lot of things could happen in that time. Sitting in cash is indeed a good position for this moment, just wait for the bottom.As for NLG, My guess is that the drop will stop around USD 0.07-0.09, where the previous support is.Disclaimer: this is not financial advice, just my view on things. Closed my general support ticket #586824 after 2 months, replaced it by #1109359, which is a "close account" request ticket. Gave them the addresses to where they can refund my funds to. Let's see if this gets more love from the support team and solves my issue quicker. Check the development branch in the github repo, that's an indication regarding the development activity.Plan is to have a new release within some weeks. My guess the testing is on a test net. Those mined coins are not spendable on the main chain. Yeah, they claim that for over a month now... how long is something like that going to take?I got an automated response to my 1.5 month old ticket last week, again... they requested a response... told them again the same thing like the previous times they wanted a response on their automated messages. Fluctuation within downtrend.... far from rebound. Wouldn't be surprised if BTC goes down to 2000 USD. People, to let you remember... the previous bubble "correction" (ATH December 2013) took over a year (January 2015) before it came into consolidation stage... which also lasted months (October 2015). The current bubble is already exploding since early December (drop at 10th, ATH afterwards, which it didn't correct from, increased volatility afterwards), the same pattern as the previous bubble that snapped. I've been through 3-4 of these bubbles already... and every time it's the same (panic on these forums, people are still in denial and such). If you followed proper investment advices, you used money you don't need the next 5-10 years, just sit this correction out. It is going to take some time, but another bubble will come.<edit>And buy low (consolidation), sell high (bubble formation)... never go full in or out... and don't trade when the market is at panic (now).</edit> Like I said, most coins are dropping because bitcoin drops. And the bitcoin drop could already been seen weeks ago (drop on 10 Dec was already an indication, the fluctuation after the ATH already showed BTC couldn't recover it's ATH, increased volatility and bubble is going to snap). What Spooly said, give it time it will recover (just not all coins will recover), just make sure you have fiat at the side line at consolidation stage to start buying for the new bubble. This stage could take months before we get there and another few months before things are consolidated. You need to ask? You worry (and cryptos are not the types of investments for you), or you don't (than you can still make profits). I guess you can state that Bitcoin is the main cause of all these markets are fluctuating. The reason that Gulden lags in this correction is the relative large fiat pairing (BTC price remains fairly stable). It's time that the fiat exchanges start pulling this, instead of BTC. Than we could see fireworks, but for now these exchanges follow the BTC price converted to euro (the CMC 1y chart shows this nicely). It's now open again for over a week (wasn't announced), you can see the trades on the front page. This has been, I think, only the second time that it was closed, both times to push updates to the exchange. The have since recently a new developer that's maintaining it.ISX and the foundation are separate identities, but a few members of the foundation also run ISX. This is mainly because those members thought an Icelandic exchange with ISK pairing is needed for adoption in Iceland (which I agree with them). Plan is to have a new release of the core wallet within a few weeks, to release theimprovements to the code base we made in past half year. 
So, in that perspective... why is so much money flowing into ICOs? Aren't those just the same promises in a new packaging? Any indication when ISX opens again?Oh... and All the best wishes for 2018!!! Lots of "Look all those awesome features we are testing, but not for you. Stay tuned for some undetermined time." and less "Testing is progressing fine, we're at <some number>% of the things we want to test, no serious bugs found so far. If no big bugs surface, next release could be around <insert date>." Funny you mention GRS, as I've been contacted by members of their community past few years about ditching country coins as GRS has true innovation according to them. NLG has been keeping up with BTC changes as well, so there is nothing new here.As for price stability, with the recent price going up in fiat (mostly driven by crypto in general) this has been at stake, but a few cents is still doable. Bittrex still seems to rule the market, so it will be up to the EUR exchanges to lock that wealth, preferably before the crypto market gets a correction/crash. The mintpal situation was before my time, but if this is really their wallet than that is indeed interesting. At least something to keep watching a bit closer. We're working on things in Iceland, but that's not new (no real updates for now). We have done market development in the past, to keep the price stable, together with the increasing BTC/fiat price, this has an effect on AUR price. The Icelandic exchange follows (Icelandic people are noticing this) and market development has shifted to that exchange. As for the pump claims, our rank at CMC is at the same level for the past few months (with a small exception a two weeks ago) indicating that this growth is comparable for the rest of the crypto market.As for the 50% claim. Mined coins were distributed among Icelandic population a few years ago, 1 million AUR were transferred to the Auroracoin foundation for promotion and development (like I said, mostly untouched until now), remains have been burned. Check OP for details. Neh ;-) Never go full in or out.Back to EUR levels from June this year?... Due to higher BTC price. Let's see where this run goes... it's way too early to call trend breach (especially on the long term). @LTEX, can you have a check what's going on here? I guess this is the HIVE wallet. License-wise they are allowed to do this, but functionality (if it really works and people actually want it) could be reverse engineered relative easily. Unless they add additional layers to hide the workings, which would be paranoia for nothing, and counteract their goal of mass adoption.@cryptoba, maybe I did, maybe I didn't, maybe I'm planning to and maybe I already bought back lots more. If you're not sure yet if there is something stolen, just keep watching closely for strange things to happen (bank accounts/loans being opened on your name, have a lawyer ready). Keep a journal of your activities on a daily basis, so you have an alibi. Keep doing this as long as it takes for your passport to expire. One thing you could do as well is get a new passport, have the old one destroyed (don't do that yourself, it's your government's property!). This might cost a few bucks, but could be the best line of defence. Again, contact a local privacy support group, they can give you better advise. I replied to your own thread.As for Bittrex, If they are genuine, they will survive. They handled the whole transition completely wrong. This started with the communication, and has worsened by not properly handling their support tickets. Also, communicating with exit strategies for people who wanted to GTFO should have been done at a much earlier state. They should have rejected payments for accounts that don't allow withdrawal. 0 BTC withdrawal limit, seriously? Even within the US legal framework this is overdoing it if there is no exit strategy.They made a shitload of errors, but as long as many people aren't effected they can continue... but be warned for when the shit really hits the fan. Depending on where you live. File a report at your local police office for identity theft. Get a lawyer, ID theft can get you into serious trouble (if you live in the USA they could maybe help you deal with Bittrex). Maybe get into contact with a local privacy-rights group that can help you, they could give you advice, if a lawyer is not an option. Different coin. Dude, relax! Not putting any fear in there, just being realistic (well, the 1 sat. was of course a bit joking).BTC price just does not matter as long as BTC keeps going up, no need to catch a falling knife. The few traders NLG has, have accepted this as truth now, that'swhy they are all waiting on the side line and not putting buy orders in. They should wait with buying until NLG hits 1 sat. That way it can't go lower every time BTC goes up. ;-) So... and your point is what exactly? Of course this is always the case for projects that are high in risk (e.g. cryptos), but when the coin was still a community driven coin this was much less. The goal at that time was mass adoption within the Netherlands, now it is "0-confirmation transactions". Two totally different audiences. Time is catching you up:https://cryptocoremedia.com/bittrex-selling-private-data-and-hiding-truth/https://cointelegraph.com/news/bittrex-leaks-user-passports-in-support-emails-says-russian-telegram-channelJumio went bankrupt in 2016, was bought by an investment?/advertisement? company.Unless you're having connections (read: lawyers) that can help you with US law... watch out with them. But this in principle counts for every exchange outside your country of residence. I'll drop this here:https://cointelegraph.com/news/bittrex-leaks-user-passports-in-support-emails-says-russian-telegram-channelI would not send my ID to these guys as long as they don't answer your support ticket (and even afterwards ONLY if you're able to get into legal (US) ways when they leak your ID). Than you know more than me... and I'm on the dev team.I have no explanation of the last night pump. Trade with caution! Buy orders on Bittrex (where this pump started) are currently in no relation with the price increase.
I'm not going to send my ID to a 3rd party "verifier" that is known to sell IDs of people they "verified". Also, verified accounts were reduced to new. None of these changes were communicated and they don't restrict sending money as long as you can't withdraw them.They also didn't gave any indication that closing your account, and have funds returned, is an option. As long as this stays murky at best, they aren't getting anything. If this is true and If they just would have communicated this in public, the problem would be a lot less for them.Also, they should have notified the user base about holding funds for hostage before the actual act (giving people a chance to withdraw). Money laundering policies should be taken only when fiat is withdrawn, most countries have those, if a country has such policies not in place, lock accounts, refund funds AND close the accounts.Make a statement that if someone does not want to go through the verification process, give the option to close accounts and return funds.These are all no-brainers. If shit hits the fan, communication becomes important. Compare this with how BTC-e handled communication when they went belly up. Kijk uit met Bittrex, laatste tijd schijnen ze accounts op slot te zetten (zonder melding daarvan) of withdrawals naar 0 te reduceren (storten kan wel), ook van geverifieerde accounts. Er zijn mensen die al meerdere maanden wachten op een reactie op hun support ticket. Watch out with Bittrex these days. They can just lock your account (verified or not) or limit withdrawal to 0 without any notification. There are people with over 3 months of waiting for their support ticket to be answered. I wonder if they could get Bittrex back in check: https://www.taylorcopelandlaw.com/blockchain-and-cryptocurrency/ He told me last week that he was planning to start buying back. So, basically there two options:1) Something malicious: count your coins lost, don't give them anything more (protect your ID).2) Overwhelmed by something, but no malicious intent: wait for them to respond, count your coins lost, but there might be a chance you get them back. In worst case they have to close your account and return your funds. For what it's worth, they state in their own terms that if due to some "contract breach", they close your account and will contact you to send your coins back. They also state they use US law, and are based in the US (so the US law statement is redundant) and even that states that if there is a contract breach (them changing terms without notification should be enough for that) funds should be returned to their respective owner.Question is, will they follow the law and their own terms? For many non-US residents (like myself), prosecuting them in court is close to impossible. I'm just going to sit this shit out and check back within a few months, but I consider the money already lost. There is no ICO, only the pre-mine, which was distributed among the people in Iceland. Of the remaining funds:- 1.000.001 AUR was transferred to the Auroracoin foundation for development and promotion in Iceland (only a small bit has been used so far).- the rest was burned (e.a. transferred to an address that nobody has the key for). Like I said, each algo has its own difficulty. In the end the result is that sha256d has a higher difficulty than scrypt,giving on average each algo as much chance of finding a block. The difference in the amount of hashes/sec between algos (irrelevant if this is due to the algo itself or the hardwarethat generates the hash) is compensated by the change in difficulty.Other said: on the same hardware, there are different amount of hashes, compensated by different difficulties. Another one, #586824 Not a verification issue (well, Basic verification didn't work), but I requested my account to be terminated and funds returned to the addresses I specified in my ticket. EV is not an option for me. Transferred a lot of coins to Bittrex for sale, to only find out afterwards that I couldn't get funds out again, while at the beginning of November everything was still fine. PoW is divided over 5 hashing algorithms. Each block (independent of the algo) rewards 2.5 AUR.Difficulty is adjusted for global (all 5 algo's) and per algo at each block. Weren't some of those retailers already mentioned in October? My guess is mostly users. Fear and desperation posts.... you know what that means. ;-) Probably more volatility on the market, less price stability. https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003004171WTF???<edit>Ow.... f*ck... I'm pulling everything from there. These guys just jeopardized our market. I'll have to re-evaluate on how to keep our market stable due to these jokers.</edit> Besides Mikki's auroracoin101.is site (and his efforts on getting more merchants on board, check his site), currently nothing newsworthy. Code development is going on. Last week I've pushed some code reconstruction changes regarding the PoW hashing calls to the development github, which is currently ongoing. This is needed for future development and takes a lot of time to make sure the results result in the same consensus as in the pre-change code (after every change we need to resync the whole chain). I don't know about profitability (I do a little bit of mining to support the coin, not profit). Personally, I have good experience with Strataspool, Maybe we should put all our moneys into Zimbabwean dollars... will give more profit than NLG... :-D
Technicality hardly matters these days any more, it's now the coin that makes the most profit in speculation.... period. Greed is high these days. The Netherlands, Rijk's brother. South-Africa, wages could be different there.But that's one developer... if I remember correctly, there are 3 developers (Rijk excluded, Mani, his SA colleague and Rits). Are they also Paid? Bought it in August as diversification on my holdings... 4.5X in EUR price since than... I don't regret it. If you look at the technicalities, BCH is these days a more interesting coin than BTC. Transaction fees, price development, politics around development, block size problems that are going on for more than 2 years, mining centralization... BTC has failed to address some serious problems for quite some time now. That's the technical bit, if you look from speculation perspective, BCH can give you much more gains than BTC (easier to accumulate more BCH and have higher price shoot-outs). Quick update: the MULTI diff algorithm is now in the repo and the electrum wallet should be able to sync fully without any problems. Do note that this process is slow at the moment! While it should work, it is not tested and the wallet should at this point be considered not safe to use. The wallet file format will most likely change in the near future as well! Manipulation? Don't get me started on that... will open the wounds that just healed. I'm here since the beginning of Gulden... you tell me what he actually does in the development process... I can't tell. He just came up with the idea and sits on a bag of money... coding is done by others in South Africa. @Zonefan, thanks for telling me I'm not a serious investor. ;-)I think most people that time told Rijk to start a foundation, not a B.V. But glad he finally did something that should have been done years ago.It will be interesting to see if the pre-mine is part of the B.V.? That's a bit of "joke" regarding the fact that he told multiple Dutch entrepreneurs (non-crypto related) to GTFO. You know, the kind with connections, successful companies and such. They released to the Apple store (and is accepted), but are not confident yet that something could go wrong? Are they still testing it? And others have already reported on it (was this leaked)? So, if you can't normally discuss the points I made with me, the only thing left to do is throwing shit towards me?I've been pretty consistent regarding Gulden. Coin: good, Dev team: wtf?. That's also why I'm still here (and not on the slack). Regarding my time here, that's only in the morning and evening or weekends... during the working days I'm busy with that other project (you couldn't let it rest, did you). Sure it is, this is what the devs want you to believe. All you need is tutorials that show how it works. Nothing of pow2 or segsig is any problem for normal users.Regular people don't do research on crypto or figure out how it works (I think most of the people in the slack (or forums) hardly knows how it works below the hood). All is open source, so they can investigate it if they want. NLG is based on LTC/BTC (changes are minimal), yet that has nobody stopped from using BTC/LTC. If you're reflecting on the complexity of the code, yes that is one pile of steaming sh*t... which originates from BTC and NLG devs are spending more and more time to keep up with. If you get back to basic block chain theory... it's not that difficult and can easily be broken up into digestible chunks. If the complexity is an issue... why are the NLG devs than implementing pow2/segsig? Which is another level of irrelevant complexity.We've got light wallets for that. If syncing is an issue, blockchain downloads are available for most coins. Syncing is slow due to two reasons: 1 is inefficient in-wallet download, which can be improved. 2 is the actual validating of the blocks, which require processor power and is the basis of the security of your chain; so if you want to speed that up, get a faster computer or compromise on your security.I think the poor ways of communicating by the devs has scared a lot of more people away than the current usability of NLG. This whole situation with the new slack is a nice example.Because else it will never be finished and ready for mass adoption. NLG will never be a completed product, nor any other coin. It will just be a tool to keep people bound to the dev team, to make them feel important. If there is a plan it should at least be clear at what point they are satisfied with to starting marketing.I'm already an early NLG adopter since a few years now... and this thing is still in the gutter... at least not where it SHOULD be if the devs hadn't rejected all the help and cooperation they could get in the past few years. You seriously have to ask? Read back the thread... I think that pretty sums up why. That's a bad thing? I would call that liberation! Meh... those "news" announcements only come when people are fed up with the situation and start bitching.... Hasn't been the first time, won't be the last time.And after the BTC fork, there will be new excuses why people are not interested in NLG, or why NLG won't go to the moon. "mainstream"... there is no "mainstream" yet. I heard he turned down multiple opportunities to get it closer to that, but apparently the dev team wants to do it all by themselves. Few weeks ago 8ct was the bottom, then 11ct was the average. Last week it seems to have problems to stay at 10ct and is 9ct the average (check CMC). I agree, it looks stable, but there is still a small downtrend (even in Euros). Bitcoin is not the best "investment" this moment... people are blinded by greed (Warren Buffet has a nice quote regarding that). They don't see the risks involved with the upcoming fork. It also became clear to me last week that someone bought a few BTC futures for 1000USD (betting on one main chain) that people don't understand how that fork will work. In that view NLG has been a safe store of value (being stable between 0.09 and 0.11USD for months). While high prices are nice, it is not our goal. People actually using it as a currency is the goal (higher prices are a logical result of that). We know from experience that spending grinds to a halt when the price goes up quickly in a short time.
Yes, coin creation is limited in a similar way as bitcoin (through periodic halving). Just a quick update regarding the Electrum-AUR wallet.Both Original and KGW diff algorithms are in and can sync until block 225000 (where the multi-algo starts). I've worked on the Multi-algo diff algorithm and hopefully I have that working by the end of this week, or else next week. Gulden mentioned on the Dutch national news:https://nos.nl/op3/artikel/2200299-dit-is-waarom-ook-jij-over-de-blockchain-wil-leren.html Mostly at a few merchants in Iceland. Joylato is the only one confirmed by us, but MikkiRefur could give a better answer to this on which merchants are in the process of getting Auroracoin accepted.*Edit*Check this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1467050.msg22554645#msg22554645 The link is a bit misleading because I think the image shows the results of the previous election.This is the one you need:http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/elections2017/ Hmmm... development is hard/slow/whatever you want to call it. Yet, people want to put more money on promises that still have to be developed instead of something that is underway to be improved. Consolidation until December and then break out on the top? Same was tried halfway August.... or will it be "different this time"TM? I don't think we're going to see that happen anytime soon. BTC was valued much lower at that time. Price has been however fairly stable between 0.40 USD and 0.70 USD for months now. There will always be new excuses why BTC will/will not dump. They raised a few hundred BTC last year for development (and a bit extra to speed it up). Devs are comfortable that their income isn't influenced to NLG price development. Yeah, someone else mentioned that after that post as well. I wasn't aware of it at that time.@Sam67, what do you mean? https://bleutrade.com/exchange/BTG/BTCCan someone explain me how they allow trading in a coin that does not exist yet? Where do those sell orders come from? And being user friendly in the process. The NLG devs have at least put some work into that. Craig Customer and Mark Merchant don't care about the tech below the hood. All they care is that stuff just runs fine and that they don't loose money during the transaction. Compare it with cars, does the average driver care about which type of engine the car runs? Nope, they just care that it doesn't break down. Check the log of your pool software, could be a problem there. I have only limited knowledge of GPU mining, but I guess for someone to solve that problem he/she would need a bit more information (setup, pool software using, GPU mining settings, etc.). Before people can spend... they have to buy, right? 1) Yes, should be, but do the calculations yourself.2) No, currently not. COVAL, someone else told me to buy it and I didn't research it properly. My other coins are doing fine, so I can keep them as long as I want. Yeah, but that effect is also wearing off again (people who think to profit from this already bought in, and have few funds left). Those people expect that Bitcoin Gold will react the same as Bitcoin Cash, but I don't believe that. Bitcoin Cash has some credit that it solved a problem with Bitcoin. Bitcoin Gold is just a quick money grab attempt, if you're quick enough you can profit from it, but many will loose money with it. Even more, some of the more favourite coins have some economic flaws that will cause them to become worthless after some time (unless people keep pumping money in them). 
Did the same... 90k NLG bought back. Started with about 10k NLG 1.5 year ago. Sure it can... but not anytime soon. But on the other hand... NLG can't drop below 1 satoshi. It will also be more and more difficult for increasing BTC to influence the NLG price to drop (becoming too expensive to dump). The EUR price becomes more important then. Gulden, dedicated devs, dedicated community, own exchange with Euro pairing, stable price around 0.10 euro cent for past few months and lots of merchant acceptance recently... despite all of this still relative cheap. ^This... and too much focus on unbacked, 100% pre-mined promises (read: ICOs) instead of helping actual proven coins getting into mainstream. Just a quick update regarding the electrum-aur wallet. I managed to get the Kimoto Gravity Well difficulty algorithm working today, which is now in my github repo. The first few thousand KGW blocks passed all checks, but I have not tested all of them yet. Next step is getting the MULTI difficulty algorithm ported, hope to finish that in two to three weeks. This was the original plan for Bitcoin (I was there at that time, check my account), which has failed it (there is some acceptance, but mostly used as "investment" vehicle with politics). NLG is a good contestant to become just that what BTC should have been. The fact that many things are done in silence is that you don't want to give false hope if things don't succeed. For every good news we hear there could just as well have been 4 projects that failed. This is not only for NLG, other coins have the same. Price stability is good for mainstream adoption and IMHO the EUR exchanges will help with that. I know a "small scale" community (~50 people) that has switched to crypto for most everyday payments, as soon as the coin they are using went up in price people started to keep the coins instead of paying with them. Took about 3 - 4 weeks after the price increase before people "accepted" the new price and started spending them again.As for all these coins/ICO's that go up in price due to hype, their community is as dedicated until the next hype coin emerges. Gulden has at least a dedicated community and a coin needs it to have any relevance (if there are no users... what's the point of a coin?). Why haven't you setup your own coin for SA yet? And what is in it for the VCs? I envy your motivation, but you could do so much more within your own SA coin. No idea, less profitable than other coins? Lots of young people paying with Gulden yesterday? evening in Rotterdam:https://twitter.com/Guldenpagina/status/912020289365651457 I'm working on electrum-aur in my own repo: https://github.com/BioMike/electrum-aur Do note that it uses my python bindings for Groestl, Skein and Qubit (and Scrypt also maybe, not sure about that) PoW algos. Especially the Groestl bindings have a different API and the latest release of that package is broken (use the git clone if you need it).Code-wise it connects to the electrum1 server and should receive and send AUR (I have not tested this yet!!!). Last week I restored part of the block validation code, including the original diff calculation algo, so it is able to validate headers until block 5400. KGW and Multi is something that I hope to start next weeks on.After that I plan to change everything to Python3 and Qt5 (GUI redesign that I also plan to use for the core wallet (which has to be translated into C++ of course)). When that's done I'll have to look at the Pywallet code that it uses (replace by my own version) and maybe switch the electrum connecting code for the connectrum library (which makes it require Python3.5)... but that last part is still far away. Development-wise things are going ok. Network runs fine. I'm currently busy fixing Digibyte's electrum wallet and converting it to Auroracoin.As for Icelandic adoption, there are a few things in the process there. The Auroracoin foundation will at least have a booth at the Icelandic IT exhibition (https://utmessan.is/). Aaaannnd.... there goes the coalition. New elections coming up? Or are they going to try to make new coalitions? https://auroraspjall.is/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=349&start=20#p1365This method didn't work? (I assumed it did, so we stopped investigating it further). What did you do and where did you get stuck.How was the paper wallet generated? *Ugh* E-gulden *Ugh*;-) Most devs have a day time job and a private life. Funding is mostly done from private means, although there is the pre-mine, which is mostly untouched.Acceptance is promoted through meetings and contact (one devs visited the TEDx event in Reykjavik last week to improve contacts with some of the speakers there (there has been contact with those speakers before)).Personally, I'm rounding off things from an old job (finishing my PhD thesis) part time and use the other time to work on Auroracoin, roughly 15-20 hours a week currently. I make my income through trading.Also, regarding Project P a demonstration of our prototype was shown last week (to show that Auroracoin works in their idea) and contact is being made now with a company to see if they would be able to implement it into their products. That's an error from my side. I already assumed they were already accepting, but it seems they are still in the process on deciding which products they want to start with and getting connected. Whatever the reason is, it's clear that the wall moved back (after the price pumped a bit). No need to sell onto that wall anyway,if it moves, it can move up.I didn't see at what time it moved back, but if it moved when people started dumping into it, my guess is that it is for a PnD scheme(or something similar). Where did wallzilla came from? That's a 160000 USD buy order there. I wonder how much pre-mine is involved...At least the market should be able to handle that amount.
The reason I come here? Multiple reasons:1) To enjoy the BS posted here as well (just like you)2) Because I still have NLG and want to follow what's going on.3) Give my views on NLG price development4) Debunk points in 1.5) I want NLG to succeed. Even if this was a PnD attempt... it's a poor one. It didn't even pump. They could have better spend the money to pump it themselves. There have been better opportunities to sell. I didn't sell then, why would I do that now? To be honest, I'm continuously buying and selling NLG, it makes a nice income without even having to touch most of my NLG stash.As for LTEX, I think he is mostly busy with other coins and not even watching NLG that closely any more. New Icelandic merchant accepting Auroracoin:http://www.baenduribaenum.is/ http://www.1limburg.nl/limburger-verkoopt-huis-voor-bitcoinsGemiste kans voor Gulden? What do you think? It is clearly FUD. Eens zitten kijken naar de long-term grafiek van NLG... er is zich een wedge van 1 jaar (sinds the ATH vorig jaar) aan het sluiten. Zoals het eruit ziet, kan dit een sterk signaal zijn voor NLG. De vorige keer dat dergelijke wedge doorbroken werd (Maart) zorgde dit in een kleine toename over enkele maanden, echter dit kan ook veroorzaakt zijn door de toename in Bitcoin. True, it surprises me that all the progress that is being made is not mentioned here. The Dutch thread here on BCT and the #Gulden twitter are full of stories (Merchants accepting NLG) that would get Gulden much higher. Merchant acceptance should be a main reason why people should have NLG, not some any-time-now tech. Yeah, a valid excuse for the Dutch tax agency... Nope, just people who want to keep the ball and play with it themselves. They raised a shitload of money last year, have the pre-mine and don't care what others think. They are committed, but you should become a loyal follower, STFU or GTFO and let them do their job, even if the price goes down the sink. I've heard quite a few investors (the real ones, the ones with lots of money and influence) ran away, multiple times, because the dev team wouldn't cooperate in getting NLG where it should be. This has been going on since NLG was launched, and I don't think things have changed over time.Then there are the things I addressed when I was active in the community (mostly regarding legal risks around the pre-mine), I doubt those are resolved. Thank you Bram, you are able to do the thing that the dev team neglects to do.Seems like the NLG devs also finally found out the shitty state about the BTC code. I wonder if they are going to keep porting all changes over from the BTC code base over time, that's going to be a waste of a lot of time. I think difficulty is pretty high these days, interest in mining AUR has been increasing (probably due to its profitability). But the mining side is not my area of expertise. We're still working on adoption of Auroracoin in Iceland. I hope to be able to give an update at the end of this week, but no guarantees. Depends on what people want Gulden to be... a highly speculated PnD coin in the top 10 of coinmarketcap... or a coin that is actually being used (independent of its price). If everyone in Pekela would be using Gulden for day to day payments.... that would be awesome. Yet, something tells me this is not the case. I've been in the Slack in the past... and left. Most users there are not traders, just people who put all their money into NLG and HODL, which is a poor strategy to build value into a coin (which is what most users there want).As for the 60000 gulden owners, I think they claim that many users on their Slack (and not actual users), but most of those accounts are from people who visited for a short time and left again, or double accounts. Yes, but so it goes with every coin that has development. BTC more than 1000% value increase, many other coins >200% value increase... and the value increase on NLG is mostly due to BTC going up. If you look at the very long term trend line... NLG is almost bumping against it. That trend line should be somewhere around 1800 sat.NLG biggest problem is currently the price increase of BTC... let's hope those EUR exchanges are here soon, so it can be decoupled from BTC. What makes you think they are paid with NLG? They collected a few hundred BTC last year... for development. Or do you mean that they already burned through that? I've requested a fellow developer yesterday to fix all the links (he has access to the account). Ok, no errors are good. I'm not sure how quick one would find a block with that amount of hashing power. Let us know when a block is mined (and accepted).
As far as I can see, these settings look right. My guess is that there is something wrong with the difficulty. I'll have a look next week if I could setup a similar testing environment, although I'm quite busy next few weeks. If someone else wants to pick this up, feel free to do so. Core wallet codeIn our previous core wallet release we moved to use the BerkeleyDB 5.3 branch, instead of using the 4.8 branch. Recently, we discovered that using the 5.3 branch raises problems on MacOSX (which is why these builds still use the 4.8 branch). Initial investigations in this problem showed that this issue is already present in the 5.0 branch. We've generated a difference file between 4.8 and 5.0, allowing us to see where the problem is introduced. The difference file is quite big and we've just started processing through this file in an attempt to isolate the misbehaving code. It could take up to a few months to go through this process, depending on how much time we have available to spend on it and how quick we identify the offending code.Project PLast week I told that we were asked by a third party to build a prototype device that could receive payments and act upon those. Last week, most of the time was spend on writing code that would allow parsing raw transactions, which we obtain from electrum if a payment is performed to the addresses the device will be watching. Next will be decoding the script part of the transaction ouputs to obtain the address we are watching.Server infrastructureLast week we continued migrating the servers and started investigating if we could move our electrum servers to the ElectrumX code base. Theinsight server also has shown some stability issues lately and we started to investigate how to reduce its down time. We also setup an additional server to import the block chain data into an SQL server, which allows us to perform advanced queries on the data. This will help us gathering real live testing data for our future code. Which algo are you mining? Have you set the "algo=<algo>" variable in auroracoin.conf? Any output in de the bug.log? plastic cards... how outdated... have you already tried the waggle feature in the Hive wallet?... or the QR code scanning?Who needs plastic, when you've got radio waves! Here is an update from the developer side (I hope to publish these a bit more often).Server migrationsAs we mentioned earlier weÂre in the process of moving infrastructure servers (e.g. seeds and electrum servers) to a foundation hosted account. This allows more developers to help if issues surface with one of them or if the developer maintaining the server is on holiday. The current state is that weÂre in the process of setting up the first few seed servers.Core wallet developmentsWhen the seeds are moved to the new servers a new core wallet will be released with the new seeds encoded in it. We will also add a few new checkpoints for the block chain. In the development branch weÂve started removing all occurrences of default namespaces. While many developers add them for more compact code, it makes it less readable to outsiders and more difficult to maintain. It also increases chances of introducing errors, thatÂs why weÂre removing them.Project PWe decided to keep details of this project to our selves, as it is currently in a prototype stage and could potentially fail. We donÂt want to be responsible for false expectations by people if the project fails. A few weeks ago the foundation was contacted by a third party from Reykjavik. They had a simple idea and asked if we could build a prototype. The main challenge for us is allowing the device to receive payments in Auroracoin. WeÂve started writing the software that runs on the chip driving the device, to use the electrum interface to detect payments. Part of this project already resulted in contribution of improvements into the connectrum library (https://github.com/coinkite/connectrum). Even if this project will not be successful, we could reuse a large part of the code for future upcoming projects. Why do you need the devs to get it added? If there are enough people asking/paying for support, won't it get listed? Yay!!! Bedankt, ik had al zo'n vermoeden, maar je weet maar nooit (je zou toch verwachten dat een journalist aan fact checking zou doen). Ik las het volgende op de NOS site (http://nos.nl/artikel/2184697-grootste-bitcoin-handelaar-legt-handel-stil.html):Eh... welke zwakke plekken in de broncode heeft deze investeerder het over? Welke hacks zijn ermee uitgevoerd?Naar mijn weten is dit niet correct... hacks zijn voornamelijk gepleegd via overgenomen systemen of bugs in exchanges... niet in de blockchain direct.Toch? Nope, that's not Iceland. Buy support dropping hard... wouldn't be surprised if it drops sub 2k. It relates to the communication between the Auroracoin foundation and the leader of the Icelandic Pirate Party prior to the elections last year. I can't remember there were any further communications afterwards. I'm also not sure what kind of news X1235 was expecting. Regarding ISX some questions:I get the message that it is in maintenance mode when I want to place an order. How long will it be like this?I see the BTC-ISX pair is being implemented... will there also be an AUR-BTC pair? Nou, dat is al lang losgelaten hoor. De devs richten zich nu op de internationale markt (zover ze zich ergens op richten)... althans dat was wat ik begreep. The VPS server that was running Hive died last week. The dev responsible for the Hive server is currently on holiday, but has someone else working on getting it up again (due to changes in the way we organize our servers it took a bit longer to get this person registered). If all things work out fine it should be up again within 24 hours. This is IMHO be the best news post in months! Why? We haven't heard anything regarding that. No. As for keeping the same block size, reduction in block rewards/coinbase should be driving the motivation of users to include fees, not an artificial limitation on the amount of transactions that could be processed. But Auroracoin is far from that, most blocks that are generated are mostly empty. The cap is also pure artificial, and was once created when people noticed they could start spamming the chain. Satoshi implemented it as a temporarily countermeasure, until a good solution would surface against the spamming.  xmpp is an extendible open standards communication protocol. They run a server for such service.Google Talk is/was(?) based on that.
I just found out that https://xmpp.is/ supports Auroracoin donations. Yay! I normally use Strataspool. It is not a big one, but reliable for me. It goes down sometimes, but I have a direct link to its admin, and he is very responsive to that. The tablets apparently weren't approved for Icelandic regulations for electronic communication devices. We have a backup plan (which we used to get Joylato connected) which we will pursue now, but that plan is a bit more expensive. In that case we have a different view of where AUR should have its place. Our view is mostly for the internal domestic market (where also ISK has its role). The only role where it might have is in the export market, where we hope AUR moves back into Iceland and in cases with tourists visiting Iceland. For large in/export markets it's IMHO just not logical to use AUR. That would be a place for BTC or LTC to shine (to replace USD playments). There is no problem foreigners holding AUR.As for the price : http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/auroracoin/#markets . Value in Iceland is comparable to BTC (international)That having said, the following:The amount of coins is pretty limited compared to other coins, and if a lot of international speculators would jump in the price would increase a lot (think when AUR was just released), but market acceptance would break to a halt (people would not spend the coins any more, this has been observed in an external experiment recently when AUR increased a lot during the last rally). Both HODLing and PnD actions (even if the dump does not result in going back to previous levels) are highly toxic to market acceptance in terms of market value perception.Price has to go up, but with the use of market makers (anyone international can do this on the exchanges BTC/LTC/DOGE exchanges) that provide liquidity for merchants to sell into and users to buy from. To all Auroracoin Coinomi users:Coinomi is going to drop Auroracoin from their wallet. Backup the passphrase that generates your keys. You can use this passphrase in the Auroracoin Android wallet to access your funds again. It already is: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.auroracoin.is Block time: 150 seconds, which means (24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds) / 150 seconds = 576 blocks / dayCurrent situation: 576 blocks * 100 coins = 57600 coins mined / day * 0.115 EUR = 6624 Euro / daySo let's say 2,5 BTC has to be "caught" every day to keep at current price.New situation, and your assumption that those 20 PoS coins/block will be HODLed.576 blocks * 80 mined coins / day =Â  46080 * 0.115 EUR = 5299.2 Euro /dayAt same BTC price, about 1,9 BTC to keep current price. Difference is 0,6 BTC.Now look at the the market volume... which is currently 87,51 BTC. What makes you think that this differenceof 0.68% will have a significant impact on MP dumping? (To be honest, 2,5BTC/day dumping by MPs should not be aproblem at all with these volumes). Zeer goeie tips! Een andere is om nooit in paniek rond grote koerswijzigingen te kopen/verkopen. Wacht totdat de rust wedergekeerd is, paniek is een slechte raadgever. Ook nooit 100% alles inleggen of verkopen, zorg dat je aan beide kanten middelen behoudt om meer te kopen/verkopen. 100k verkocht op elk 5100 sat en 5200 sat, vervolgens 255800 NLG teruggekocht op 4000 sat. Gewoon op Bittrex. Maar winst maken kan je in principe met ieder bedrag, al is het dan wel iets kleiner. Die verkooporders had ik wel al sinds november staan. Check out the older country coins (watch out, there are scams there as well).Auroracoin (AUR) is an Icelandic country coin. Last 1,5 year the focus had been on stabilizing the chain, building the market (with an AUR/ISK exchange, moving AUR back into Iceland) and getting the brand out with marketing and events. Currently, AUR is early in the process of getting brick and mortar merchants hooked up.Another coin to watch in Gulden (NLG), which has/had(?) pretty much the same goal for the Netherlands.Other country coins are there as well (Sterlingcoin for the UK, not sure where they are at the moment), but might not be active any more. As far as I understood, those exchanges are done by individual community members, not the NLG developers. Nocks + Litebit have ~20% of the market... and this is "Volume"... a total of pumps AND dumps... so not $50k dumps. It could very well be that only $10k ends up on Bittrex. Of je verkoopt er een aantal tijdens een pump en koopt er meer terug tijdens de daaropvolgende dump... Afgelopen weekend toch weer mooi 55800 NLG extra in kunnen slaan op deze manier... die weer mooi bij thuisbezorgd uitgegeven kunnen worden. Version 5.3 is the correct version and the default Berkeley DB in most Linux distros.It should be possible to run both versions on a system (to also run other wallets), but you might need to use the configure option (see ./configure --help) to point to the correct version, although it should be able to find the correct version by itself. Do others also notice the "500 Internal server error"? I've picked up that BTC seems to be an official currency in Japan, could be the reason that Asia is leading this bull run. No news, my best guess is that money flowing into the crypto community as a whole is also moving into AUR. A week ago I thought 100ISK parity would not be reachable this year... now I'm not so sure about that any more. But yeah, ISX desperately needs sell orders now. Bottom line. PoW block is signed by a selected node (in a sort of PoS fashion) before accepted in the chain. The signing node can add transactions to the block. So instead of one miner, you have now two miners per block.It's something to work around some of the Blockchain problems, but calling it "Blockchain 2.0" is IMHO a bit of a far fetch. And it is something to have the centralised signing node, run by the dev team, removed. Good luck with the Eurovision Song Contest this evening!
Yeah, I guess so. I personally don't like them, they disturb the market too much. I wonder if this pump is related to this, although I doubt these groups have this much funds to push the price up this much.Â  Could be a whale anticipating in them in trying to pump it Ok.... 95K panic buy? Ja, maar je blijft afhankelijk van dat zij een blok vinden. Great! Can you give some feedback on how it went (the transaction I mean)? Did everything go smooth? Sure, but also don't forget to spend a bit (and ask merchants if they accept Auroracoin). That would help us a lot.Money needs to roll. Wachten is het enige wat je nu nog kan doen, als je transactie in blockchain.info staat, is hij goed doorgekomen (die transactieversneller zou ik niet teveel in geloven). Ik heb afgelopen jaar ook wel eens wat transacties gedaan die enkele dagen nodig hadden om door te komen. Yeah, I noticed. I'll try to refill, but it might take a some days.  We'll keep an eye on it and refill as needed. There are currently still 10 sell orders to 22 ISK, purchasing now on other exchanges for selling on ISX, would have more expensive orders than that and would be an unnecessary pumping of the price. I was the one who started that, but I noticed a few times that people are copying it, which is IMHO not a problem. I chose a value that I could use as a measure in how much dumping would occur, that could support the price (and keep it stable) and generate enough order size for merchants to convert back to ISK (although it is now also used for bag holders to cash out). Part of the dumped out AUR are transferred to ISX, initially as a way to transfer AUR back into Iceland, to provide a similar support of the price and again to actually build the support for merchants.It's all part of building a system to economically support AUR to become a good alternative to ISK.  Still here... don't know for others, but my view is limited to the very few coins that actually have long term potential instead of the quick PnD coins that don't really offer anything new. I had a look at the tool, but it requires some adjustments before it can be used for Auroracoin wallets. Development was performed on the Bitcoin version of the schildbach wallet, so it needs some adjustments for making it Auroracoin compatible. I guess you mean the Schildbach wallet. Yes, that one has been a problem for us as well (don't get me started on that). We had someone write a tool for it to recover the private keys and to import them into the core wallet (if I remember correctly). But we have not yet had the time to really look at it, or write a tutorial for people to follow on how to actually do that. I'll try to have an initial look at it soon and keep the thread updated regarding it. Block 2100000 Mostly dead coins gets relisted due to new developments... relist happens at 1 sat.I know some people who said to watch out for this, so I bought a few between 320 and 350 sat... and placed some buy orders on lower positions. Everything is possible, but for our goal it is not needed. The chain runs stable and full anonymity is not a goal for us. It only adds extra overhead to the code, which we want to keep as clean as possible... which isn't a luxury if we want to keep this going beyond 2140. Niet direct online en wellicht ook kleinere marges dan bij crypto... maar dit kan lucratief zijn om je BTC te herinvesteren:https://www.blandlord.com/Let wel op: dit is NIEUW, en de Nederlandse wetgeving is hierop nog niet aangepast. Ze hebben wel contact met de AFM. Andere opties zijn een dode coin reviven... of meehelpen met een andere coin (met actief dev team). Vooral bij die laatste hoef je niet actief met de coin ontwikkeling bezig te houden.Zoals hierboven al gezegt, een coin starten is makkelijk... het onderhouden een stuk uitdagender. Check out Darcrus (DAR)... token itself is not the chain where it is stored, but the company/developer behind it is utilizing block chain tech to develop applications to store data for companies. No, not really. Things are released as they are finished. We're a bit low-profile with regards of hyping things. Yeah, there was a pretty massive dump on ISX yesterday. I think this is because of the drop in price of BTC. Could be someone doing arbitrage between Bittrex and ISX. All in all the differences between Bittex and ISX is now smaller.
See my comment above. People have recently offered me NLG for services... I declined because I already have too much of it (yes, that is possible). I'm not saying these things for buying more at a lower price, (read again: I have enough NLG). With the recent pump and dump I'd rather see a stable NLG price for a few months. That would be a signal for me to buy. I always do things targetted at long term.Like I said: whitepaper or code implementation release would both be fine for me. I'm more interested in how they would achieve things that the whole crypto community hasn't been able to solve yet. Credit where it's due, but not on vapourware.A whitepaper could also help other people to look at it before it is released. It is easy to miss errors or loop holes, which could be removed before actual code is in production. That things go wrong are shown quite often (even NLG hasn't got a clean track record in that respect). I'm an foss supporter, this is in line with the same principles as in the FOSS community. What? That you call the coin that I work on a scam coin is fine by me. Many uninformed people parrot others, but where did you get that I scam people? Please enlighten me who I scammed and how? I do my development on my coin in my spare time (I don't get paid for it), I don't expect anything from any one, all I want is that it becomes successful. I'm also not part of Criptoe, as far as I know only one member in our dev team is part of Criptoe. All other members are not.The reason I still own Gulden has nothing to do with the NLG dev team or their choices, but more that I want NLG to succeed as well as the coin I participate in development. Dumping my whole stash on the market would damage NLG too much, which it and its legitimate users IMHO would not deserve. Back on-topic:As far as Prime, we've only heard a fancy name and some vague claims of what it will be. That's why I call it vapourware. I've put a lot of effort in NLG in the past and I think people deserve to hear as many opinions regarding this as possible (to make a good judgement on the topic question). It might not seem like that, but I'm trying to be constructive here, not whining. But you know what... I let you guys to it... got better things to do than spend my time on trolls. Nowhere it was mentioned they hired the company to do their development, why would they hide this fact if that's really true? They have hired external developers/companies in the past to do development.We solved our problems... NLG is "still tweaking" it. Besides, recently we solved many problems DGB still has. As for the rest in development, our markets are reasonable healthy, in Iceland we have a lot going on, and more is coming up. And we have a foundation that keeps an open ledger on the remaining pre-mine (minus the airdrop and burned pre-mine), instead of being in possession of a single person that can be hit by a car, has to pay taxes (1,65% on the pre-mine in euros, box 3 of the Dutch income tax) and might have legal obligations to others where they could claim the pre-mine.Our code might not be as "fancy" as NLG's code... but "fancy" doesn't make "your house in better order" by definition. A whitepaper would be nice and push it further than the vapourware Prime currently is. For me it's just a hype train that you can follow or not. Until provided with more insight on how it would work, or an implementation in the code don't bother with it.As for the devs: both coding devs have apparently a full time paid job (translation software development, http://tshwanedje.com/about/ ), I still find it strange that people bought into the idea that they would work full time on NLG. ^This... I am/was a supporter of Bitcoin since it was 2 weeks old... but the issues rising with bitcoin in the past two years are not being handled... instead a lot of development is spend in "solutions" that make bitcoin less attractive to use it in the long term. The only reason that I still have bitcoins is that you more or less need it for trading many alts. Which makes these alts also vulnerable to the price whims you see with Bitcoin, due to jokes like BU and alike. Tsja... Rutte I... 65 blijft 65 in campagne en nog geen uur na de uitslag was het "breekpunt" alweer van tafel... Geert wilde regeren, maar zoals je al juist opmerkt, zonder verantwoordelijkheid... Daarnaast ook geheel in lijn met de stemgeschiedenis van de PVV in de tweede kamer afgelopen jaren. De VVD kan de zetels van de PVV gewoon bij zichzelf erbij tellen. Hoeven ze nog niet eens in een coalitie/gedoogconstructie samen te werken.De VVD doet ten minste nog een beetje moeite om hun ideeÃ«n op papier te zetten. Echter hun wens van VVD tegen de PVV in de campagnetijd is er gelukkig niet gekomen. Ik zag afgelopen week ook al een Wilderscoin langskomen. Het nut van dergelijke coins snap ik ook niet echt.Betreffende op Geert stemmen... nee, ik heb liever een partij die iets verder komt in de plannen dan een A4-tje (al kan ik begrijpen dat je ook niet meer te melden hebt als "de islam" het probleem is en minder "de islam" de oplossing is).  South park reference. There is increased liquidity on ISX compared to November. It is worthwhile to trade there now. That explains the volume. ISK is also very volatile. You could easily loose more than 20% if not selling now. When bought in 2008 post-crash you could have a nice profit now... even with 20% loss. It seems most currency controls will be lifted on coming Tuesday:http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2017/03/12/iceland_government_lifts_capital_controls/ The tourism industry is increasing a LOT in Iceland. It is also a great way to get most of the AUR moved back to Iceland. For tourists it should become more cheaper to buy AUR than ISK (in respect to transaction fees) and easier to carry. And then most Icelandic people speak English good enough to understand it. Same as bitcoin, litecoin, Digibyte. All transactions are recorded in the blockchain and can be tracked.  I've notified the team member responsible for that, thanks. The latest wallet, released a few days ago, should prevent that. https://github.com/aurarad/Auroracoin/releases Please read the OP. It contains most of the info you want.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1467050.msg14804542#msg14804542 Here some material for inspiration:http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/nature_and_travel/2017/03/06/icelandic_aurora_photo_published_by_nasa/I know it's off-topic, but I had to share. The orders at ISX generated also a bit of joy on my side. It has improved the order books considerably (there was a huge gap between buy and sell there). For merchant acceptance in Iceland it is good to have small trading gaps there, as it reduces their risk for conversion. As for "Auroracoin is back"... it never went away, the dev team and foundation have been just very busy in the past few months. I hope we can show some of these developments soon. The new wallet release is a first step towards that. Correct, but the above is also about me being realistic about the market. The elections might give a short term boost, but not structural recovery. The first thing that the NLG market needs now is consolidation. I see there is a NLG-EUR market in the making... IMHO currently the best development that NLG needs (besides merchant acceptance of course). Hmmm... suddenly someone places 25BTC buying orders... interesting...
1) Elections won't affect NLG, the parties most likely to get into control are the same established parties as in the last decade.2) Comparing to the situation with AUR... this is like comparing apples to elephants.3) I'm currently not touching NLG with a 5 foot pole...4) ... which brings me to market psychology... what's going on here. Not traders, manipulators, or otherwise... just the lack of people willing to buy.5) Not going up anytime soon. Version 2017.02.1.0 of the wallet software has now officially been released.https://github.com/aurarad/Auroracoin/releases/tag/2017.02.1.0This is a maintenance release. Updating is advised, but not required.- Improved wallet loading speed.- New checkpoints and updated seeds.- Versioning code improvements.- Minor in-wallet improvements.- Removal of testnet and regnet code.- Removal of Tor/Onion routing network support.The MacOSX build will follow later. If you make the changes only here: https://github.com/tumist/p2pool-aur/blob/release/p2pool/bitcoin/networks.py#L187 (Lines 187 to 189). Then I think that it won't affect the other coin nodes, as this seems to be auroracoin specific. I'm not sure about your setup, as the repo above does not include coins as "Dash", "EMD" and "VTC", so I guess you use a different repo for those coins? Also the repo you mention seems to be quite outdated (and doesn't include skein, and possibly the auroracoin sha256d support, which you seem to have on the pool).A fork of the pool software in our own repo should be possible, but I'm not sure if it should be the outdated pool software above (the main (BTC) p2pool repo seems still to be developed). So, I'm not really sure on what would be the best to follow here (The p2pool-DGB versions could also be used, as the current code is based on the DGB code). Ok, I had a look at it. The code tries to access the "testnet" output from the getinfo rpc call, which is removed from the new version.Looking at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=457574.0 I've come up with the following solution:In p2pool/bitcoin/networks.py you need to find the "RPC_CHECK=" definition, which should be something in the line of:Code:RPC_CHECK=defer.inlineCallbacks(lambda bitcoind: defer.returnValue(Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 'auroracoinaddress' in (yield bitcoind.rpc_help()) andÂ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â not (yield bitcoind.rpc_getinfo())['testnet']Â Â  Â  Â  Â )),This needs to be changed into: Code:RPC_CHECK=defer.inlineCallbacks(lambda bitcoind: defer.returnValue(Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 'auroracoinaddress' in (yield bitcoind.rpc_help())Â Â  Â  Â  Â )),That should prevent the exception. Do note that this removes a check that could potentially prevent things running amok further in the code, but my guess are that those chances are slim (it checks for the testnet not being active, which we removed). We've removed the testnet from the auroracoin code (it has no use for us and complicates the code unnecessary). From your error message it seems that p2pool tries to get information regarding the testnet (not sure why it tries to do that). Which code do you use for the p2pool? You got a link to github for that? Then I can have a look on how you should modify the code prevent/solve this error. Read my edit above for one example. Others are intervening with trading (at the coin I'm co-developing we caught a massive dump from the Cryptsy cold wallet stash, preventing the market from crashing), setting up an exchange with fiat pairings (Nocks will do to some extend, but it is not a real exchange). An other thing they did was "selling" part of the pre-mine during the pump for BTC (through Nocks), which in essence isn't a bad thing, but that hasn't been converted back to NLG and returned to the pre-mine. There are many more things you could do to support the financial development of your coin. I did some of those when I was in the NLG community, but was requested to stop those because people wanted to pump the price. They got their pump after a few failed attempts, and NLG is still recovering from that. Sure, but there are also measures devs can take to prevent that to some extend. The NLG devs have decided not to do that.<edit>Price manipulation is a different discussion. If you keep scaring away people with money that want to help your coin to succeed, you can expect these things to happen. NLG was/is in an ideal position to not to be very sensitive to that (although some design changes were made in the past that not really helped in that respect).</edit> So, if, for example, the devs would stop developing the coin today... traders would not care? Meh... these "fights" with the devs are as old as the coin itself, nothing new. Yeah, it is safe to use. This will be the new version, but we've been a bit slacking on the binaries and release notes. Auroracoin is mentioned on Cointelegraph again:https://cointelegraph.com/news/cointelegraphs-guide-to-national-altcoins-a-viable-local-alternative Hi adamastor,Your comments have been more insightful lately then in the past. My compliments for that. We had some internal discussion regarding this CB meeting. This also shows that the foundation is positioning themselves as an authority on crypto/blockchain tech. I think this is a good development. It also shows the CB is a bit clueless on what can be done and what should be not (hence my previous comment). Even if the CB releases their own "i-krona" blockchain, they have the same trust record regarding ISK in terms of financial stability (which is poor and is the reason why AUR exists in the first place). For now I don't see the CB people as the bad guys and I consider all options open. Mind that these are just initial talks. Getting rid of cash is the most stupid thing a country could do. It makes your whole economic infrastructure dependent on the power grid AND network infrastructure. For both you can't guarantee 100% uptime. Cryptos complement cash, not replace it. The upper downtrend-line was broken halfway January. Since then a resistance has been formed at 2100 sat. Trading boundaries are between 3100 sat and 2100 sat. The only worry is the (still) declining value in the buy order books.NB: This is not an advice for trading, but how I view the NLG market at the moment. You can always check the development branch on github. There has been activity going on over there, that should give you hints about activity. Qubit, Skein and Groestl could still be mined with CPU, although don't expect too much from it. In short for the easiest way of mining.1) Find the folder that contains your wallet.dat file.2) create a file "auroracoin.conf" in that folder with the line "algo=<algoname>". Replace <algo> by, "qubit", "skein" or "groestl" and save the file.3) Open the wallet and go to the debug screen, to the command line tab.4) Enter "setgenerate true [cores-to-use]". [cores-to-use] is optional, if not set all available cores are used, so you can use this to use less cores.5) Use the command "getmininginfo" to see if it is running fine.6) Wait.Do note it can take very long before you find a block this way.Better is to do mining with a standalone miner program and use that to connect to a mining pool. Nice, but you can't pay Icelandic bills though ;-) They require payment to keep it running. Feel free to pay them to do so, but don't expect any help from the dev team. I've been following the market the last few weeks. Some observations:* BTC price is up ~30% since the start of the year.* USD price kept steady around 0.11 USD (+/- 0.02USD)* The support wall at 12k sat. hasn't been touched since it has been placed a few weeks ago and support has been building up above it. Liquidity has been improved since November/December.I think this is a good basis for some nice growth this year. Let's not go into that again. I'm still following NLG. I still own NLG, have my opinions on NLG development, and still hope that it will be accepted widely in the Netherlands in a not so distant future. If people spread FUD or require some info for things that happened in the past I will let my voice be heard.
Thank you for the reply. I will be looking forward to it. Yeah... makes you wonder if people actually read into what DAR tries to achieve. Well, I guess I'm going to be flamed at for showing up here again... but what the heck.It's how HD wallets work, I think I've seen it in some BIP before. Nothing special there. And the code for it is on their public github repo.The main reason for stepping back from the airdrop was the costs involved to maintain the infrastructure compared to the amount of people asking for them and the many fraud attempts with that. The dev team decided to stop the giveaway and, if I remember correctly, asked the community what to do with the premine. I think most people agreed that using it for development was the best option. This looks interesting, is there a source code repo somewhere to inspect the written code and play a bit with it myself? Free on the market? Relative few, compared to the total. Most of it is locked up with people in it for long term, a part is held by the foundation and the market stabilization software (wallet peak #1 on Bittrex). The latter is in principal available for the right price. Then there is also quite an amount not accessible to non-Icelandic people, on the Icelandic exchange.For more metric, see also: http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/auroracoin/ Try this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1495990.0 Or their slack (check their website). They seem to target only Yobit, which is only a minor exchange for AUR. I advice people to stay away from that exchange, as the owners are clearly incompetent. We're not here to beat Gulden, we're here to get Iceland using Auroracoin. Lots of things have been done last year, not all mentioned here (and some that can't be disclosed). One of the most important things was fixing the blockchain by going multi-algo, things have been running very smooth since then. The summer holiday smashed a large hole in the development process, but last few weeks things are speeding up again.As for the price, it is higher then before the new dev team started.  Yes, that wallet is me. I've moved some coins from the market, as it seems that it makes people nervous. Wat tips (geldt voor iedere crypto) voor beginnende speculanten:1) Als de koers sterke schommelingen maakt (zowel omhoog, als omlaag), wacht. Of plaats alleen orders waar je op wilt kopen/verkopen.2) Staar je niet blind op de koers, het volume in de orderboeken zelf geven beter aan wanneer te kopen en verkopen.3) Ga nooit 100% in of uit.4) Als je puur wilt speculeren, gebruik alleen geld wat je kan missen. Ga er van uit dat je 100% van de waarde verliest.5) Verdiep je in wat je koopt en hobbel niet als een kip zonder kop achter anderen aan. The current market is not very liquid and a large quantity of the coins are held by people known by the dev team. Roughly a month ago the Cryptsy wallet funds were transferred to Bittrex. Coins were held, which allowed us to catch them from being dumped by placing market orders. I think with no other coin, developers would have stepped up to protect the market at such dump. A relative stable price is IMHO also important for a coin. Most hoardings are done through buying them at the exchange, not mining. Miners also need to pay electricity bills and equipment upgrades, so hoarding is only limited. I'm also not touching the Gulden topic as well. But reading the quote above, I think you turned my point around. It's not that markets can't grow, but IMHO (in the case of Gulden) miners NOW will profit relatively more than those in the past, WITH reduced risk.But in general, mining facilitates the chain (and its economy), not the other way around. Mining should not be the main focus of a coin. A constant reward is IMHO not such a good idea, as it doesn't take into consideration that the market will grow. In a young market there is much more risk involved regarding success of the coin, which IMHO should also pay off for the miners. Later, if the coin really takes off, there is less risk involved. How would you justify this to the early miners? They get the same reward, more profit, for less risk. The rise of difficulty should counteract the ASICs, to some extend. The halving was made to (1) restrict the creation of the coin and (2) reward the mining effort, while the influence of newly created coins on the economy would have a reducing effect, allowing it to grow. Fees should take over the mining rewards at halving and eventually the stop of generation of new coins. The time of halving becomes less and less a factor on the market with each halving.  Have used Gulden (NLG) quite some times in the past to buy Fast food (not only pizza's). There is no address in the code. The address is added during the mining process. Read into blockchain basics before asking such fundamental questions. The bitcoin wiki is a good place to start.The current pre-mine addresses are the addresses where the coins were send to by the Auroracoin foundation after receiving them from the Auroracoin creator. The rest was sent to the burn address by the creator. In that case, build the code, have two wallets connect to each other, start mining and the pre-mine will show up in the wallet that finds the block. It's that simple.Do note that you will not be able to spend these coins on the real Auroracoin network. Sorry, I don't have time for helping you with that. I can give you a few tips:1) Use a dead and abandoned coin, so you don't get strange results by connecting to a live coin. You'll get errors about invalid blocks if you try to do so.2) Use the documentation on internet, you should be able to create a coin without too much problems. The most tricky part is the generation of a genesis block, but doable.3) Most coin settings are in a single file these days, see src/chainparams.cpp.4) First try to successfully generate a genesis block. A pre-mine can be implemented later again (wipe the blockchain, but reuse the genesis block).5) For mining you need at least two wallets connected to each other. Auroracoin is running live and well (I'm a member of its dev team). It also passed beyond its litecoin base.Why do you want to alter things in the coin specs? Why auroracoin? There are dozens of dead and abandoned coins that you could use for your experiment. Please don't use caps for whole sentences, it is annoying.As for your question: https://github.com/aurarad/Auroracoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L1314
I'm not going to start this fight again. Yes, there were people who were sad with me leaving. I'm not sure what the community found out about me leaving, but see my point 2 above. Some people had disagreements with the dev team, some left, some remained and some came back. For me there was nothing more to it. I tried to distance me from NLG as much as possible, not being in the way of NLG achieving greatness, yet people try to drag me in again and again. Well, here is my contribution:1) Gulden... still a hell of an idea. I'm glad it exists. I had my issues with some of the development members. And left the community because I felt I was not wanted any more, for months I didn't even look at it. Sometimes I got a PM from community members, to which I replied as honest as possible.2) People informed me of conspiracies against me and LTEX (BioTex), which were based on nothing.3) Yes, I entertained myself last year with that 1680 sell wall (and it's running up pump), which was retracted after 1 day. Soon afterwards I left the community by removing/disabling my Gulden slack account AND the stabilization software as requested by the dev team.4) Most of my coins are still in cold storage. Yes, I sold some at last ATH, just like many other people trading NLG.  I've withdrawn 90k (minus the small bittrex fee) to AdKmKPUmNaBv671cWv7CqnEG6ZNcg54FwF. 45k has been send to ISX. Point 1 could be partially due to the stabilization software that I run on Bittrex/AUR. This causes extra trades (and volume), while no transfers on the chain. Other traders helped in it.Point 2 is now me. I will move a part of those funds from the market, give me some time to do that. Part goes into cold storage until the market needs it. Other part goes to ISX (the Icelandic exchange).Point 3 I can't verify. Looks normal for me now and here. To clarify. This wall is just to protect the market against this huge stash of coins. When that stash disappears (through slowly selling or transferring away from the exchange), this wall will also go. Danslip, please stop the bullshit. You don't speak for me, nor LTEX (can't speak for 24kilo, as I don't know him personal).People claiming pump and dump, should know better. NLG came from around 400 sat, and now it is at 7319. Yes, It went down a bit from its ATH, but for its own good. The market at 18 october was very unstable, this correction is good. Market conditions (order books, coin spread, fundamentals, etc.) have improved vastly since the correction and first signs of the steady way up are already present again. 4.8 is quite outdated, making it more difficult to keep build (and run) environments sane (Ubuntu for example needs the package from an external repo, adding extra steps to use it). Devs in our team have been using 5.3 for some time now and problems have yet to surface. If I'm correct the "compatibility issues" are all because of backwards compatibility is lacking (if you upgrade you can't go back any more).You can still keep using 4.8, but you have to build it yourself. New release, release notes and downloads: https://github.com/aurarad/Auroracoin/releases/tag/2016.08.1.0 There is always a risk that this type of hardware appears, but it isn't an issue as long as the chain is progressing in a stable way. With some luck it brings Chinese tourists to Iceland to spend the money. Supporters slack is here:https://aurorafans.slack.com/I've pushed the development branch onto master. Windows and Ubuntu packages will follow later today (unless something interferes with my schedule). Upgrade is advised, but not required. I'm in the process of preparing a new wallet release, which has been overdue for some time.As for considering switching algos... no. Unless there is a VERY good reason, there is no need to pollute the code any further with these type of changes. We are not here to cater miners, we have plenty of other things to do that can take up our precious time. Oops, door alle drukte van de radar verdwenen. Ik zal je even een PM sturen. Very nice opening of the match (previous match had a nice ending). Brussels (Belgium) has to kick out Wales first (Shouldn't be too hard for the Red Devils)...But... next match will be against France...Iceland against Belgium would be a hell of a finale... On an old netbook of mine (core2 with 1 GB of ram) loading the wallet software takes about 6,5 minutes (I actually had to test that recently). On my i3 system with 4 GB, it loads in what?... 10 seconds at most. Syncing happens in about 1 minute to fetch 2/3 weeks of block chain data.Most coin wallets I encounter require quite some memory, not sure what happens in that though, but the amount of connections it makes has some influence on it (as I've seen in the past).For me I can live with that. Both Coinomi and the Hive wallet are light wallets that you can use for speedy' transactions. For both the keys are stored client-side and suitable for day-to-day payments (aka, only load a bit of money on them). Normaal vind in de acties van de AH wel leuk, maar de dinoplaatjes actie doen me niet zoveel. Toch al een hoop kaartjes bij elkaar verzameld (heb ze net eens allemaal opengemaakt en gesorteerd).Zijn er nog mensen hier die hun verzameling compleet willen maken (of voor familie/vrienden)? Laat dan even hier de nummers achter die je mist, dan kan ik die cross-checken met wat ik zelf heb.In persoon ruilen kan voor mij in omgeving Den Haag/Voorburg, Leiden en Valkenburg aan de Geul (af en toe). Opsturen wil ik ook wel doen, maar dan wil ik de verzendkostenÂ  wel vergoed hebben (betalen in AUR, NLG en eventueel in BTC mogelijk). Don't forget that most whales can't trade on the Icelandic exchange. It has remained stable, where bittrex dropped past few days (in USD value). Opening up arbitrage possibilities and opportunities to import AUR into Iceland. Oops. Thanks for fixing that. Most wallets are crap build on crap... the Digibyte wallet is no exception in this. We are aware of that. That's why we have a few maintenance releases upcoming, to remove a lot of cruft that accumulated in time (check the official forum on plans and discussions around that). That having said, block times are no issue, for AUR sync times are not that bad (yet). For fast payments, use web wallets, or a payment provider that instantly confirms.I don't agree with the scam history. As far as I see, the original dev of auroracoin laid out a plan, fulfilled it and disappeared (the follow up by the current dev team could have been better, but that's past us now). If people here think it's a scam... it doesn't matter, BCT is not the target audience, the Icelandic people are.Iceland has about 3.3k inhabitants... the size of an mid-sized Dutch/European city. We had a media campaign almost 2 months ago and this gained a lot of interest in Iceland. The type of interest you would not get if people where "tired of scams". The same could be seen on the Icelandic AUR exchange last week. What are you exactly trying to do? The quote is about mining... but you want to use coinomi? Also in-wallet networkhashes are estimates. Cryptocoins are decentralized (Surprise!), which is also the case with mining. The network does not know who is mining until a block has been found by the miner. All are guestimates, if we knew how many hashes would be on a network jump pools would have not be a problem for so many coins.Nope, but feel free to send in a patch.And why would that supposed to be?
Try on the market place of the official forum: http://auroraspjall.is/viewforum.php?f=14We welcome some activity there. People accessing the development branch in the github repo, be cautious of using this, it can potentially result in loss of coins.More info: http://auroraspjall.is/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=350#p1321 Each algo has its own difficulty. Cryptocoin 101, look it up. We counter-acted it to some extend, but things seem to settle now. Transition went IMHO pretty smooth. The exchange will go out of beta a few days later. Trading (and registration) has been already possible though. No idea. If it has an effect (as in Icelandic people buying it), we will see it within a few days. But I hardly doubt it. Look at the comments on twitter, the ads have the effect we wanted (awareness in Iceland). This was intended as a slow wake up call to the Icelandic people. This will be a long term process until we get all things in place that are being worked on, this promotional ad was an initial thing. Set the bittrex chart to 1D and zoom in/out until you get the graph starting this year. You'll see that this is just a correction for something that has increased 10 fold in a few months. People speculated on the Panama papers, which generated the recent prise increase. Now that news has settled in, the market corrects. Gulden isn't a country coin any more... they parted from that during the rebranding (the dev team stated that at the time as well). Also, a lot depends on the team behind it (scammer devs that drop out after pump) and the country specific conditions (ISK has gone through a hard time since 2008 and people are completely fed up with the unreliability as a store of value of their everyday currency). 1. I think we tried to contact both Nite69 and JoiBlumen a couple of times last year (maybe my fellow devs can remember better), no luck with that.2. We're trying to tackle the issue in this thread: http://auroraspjall.is/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3493. db4.8 has been an issue for ourselves as well during the release of this wallet. Next few wallets will be "maintenance releases", an upgrade for BerkeleyDB is planned in that. Other things we plan to tackle during those releases: https://github.com/aurarad/auroracoin/wikiThe discussion about the db4.8 upgrade still needs to be done (on the official forum, mostly, which version are going to use?), if you want to join in with that, then that would be great. You'll have to get it from the bitcoin repo: https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/ubuntu/bitcoinIn the next version we hope to tackle this issue by upgrading to a newer Berkeley DB version.As for building from source, check the output of configure. It tells you if the Qt wallet will be build or not (and why). Remove the peers.dat after upgrade and try again. It should pick up the network instantly. Normally, you should not get any "out of memory" error (even when we're not at 225000 yet). Do you get the same with other wallets (Digibyte)? Is it repeatable? How is the system load? We're in the process of setting up the development repo on the aurarad github. As for the history lesson, thank you for the correction. Depends if you want to mine or not. You can use them... or not. From our point of view it is to prevent stalls on the block chain (due to jump pools), which are a road block (pun not intended) on getting AUR accepted in Iceland. I asked the promotion team to release all the data over time (starting about two weeks ago)... I hoped they would release info more sooner. As I will be pushing changes for the hard fork to one of my public repo's today... here is the big news:Auroracoin goes multi-algo. Scrypt, SHA256, Groestl, Qubit and Skein (same algos as Digibyte) will be the algos that we are going to use. There will be a few more changes (mostly as a result of the implementation of this change), but I let that over to the other team members to release. Current planning for testing and bug fixing is going fine. If no problems arise the new wallet will be available mid March. Seed nodes run at: s1.auroraseed.net, aurseed1.criptoe.com, s1.auroraseed.com, s1.auroraseed.org and s1.auroraseed.euThe new wallet should pick these up automatically, but can take time. Best is to remove your peers.dat file before starting the new wallet. I think it came up in a discussion within the dev team once. If I remember correctly nobody knew whose it is/was. Just assume it is a normal address. Ny2cafuse and I were the only ones involved with that (I was also against the NLG change, just as this change.) and have taken a position in this. The double standards also crossed my mind, but the situation here is completely different. Ny2cafuse wants to prevent a big difference in price (stabilize the price), while the NLG people argued that the price was too low and hoped to pump it this way (higher price). Also, with Fuse' solution the drop stays at specific points the same (just in between those points are changed), while the NLG solution is a one time drop of 10x and keep it the same for 60 years into the future.
I've posted my ideas regarding this on the official forum. No need to repeat it.The new change is needed for chain stability. It adds already complicated code, but that is needed. The problem you describe can be solved with solutions that don't add extra complexity to the code. Like posted on the other forum, your problem is part of a bigger economic problem that has to be tackled any way.Look at our NLG friends. They dropped the reward 10x, because they expected that that would make the price going up. It didn't happen. What did happen was that the price dropped further.To continue: the first drop would be from 12.5 to 6.25 (and according to you the price would almost double, so let's say 20000), then the next drop it goes to 3.125 (and according to you the price would almost double again, 40000), next drop 1.5625 (again almost double of price?, 80000)... now what's the economic logic behind every price increase if the drops become smaller and smaller? As the price increases more and more bag holders would start selling, pushing the price down. This is even without taking into consideration that there would be a healthy Auroracoin economy that would stabilize the price by itself (by providing sufficient liquidity). Finally, it easier to pump the price from 10000 to 20000 than from 40000 to 80000. So, if the first halving is a bit bumpy, the next halvings will have less and less effect as the price would go up. In principle the supply will remain untouched. The only exception that I see is implementing Proof of Transaction if the total amount of coins is insufficient for a proper AUR-based economy (undefined yet what that would be). The first halving of Bitcoin had no measurable effect on the price (the price increase before and after that time could have more be attributed to more people discovering Bitcoin and the fraudulent actions by MtGox at that time. At the block where the halving happened, the price hardly reacted, the largest changes happened with weeks of interval.If the economy and money supply is healthy enough (the latter is already the case for AUR, the first not so yet), there should be no shock in price. Also, I've had already discussions with the ISX people on measures to stabilize the price on their Icelandic exchange. The price calculations/speculations from GuÃ°mundur (new Icelandic MBA that the foundation had a 5 hour talk with last week) are part of determining strategies for this.But if people want this discussion (IMHO it is a solution for a problem that does not exist), the official Auroracoin forums is the place to do that. Hallo allemaal,Zoals jullie weten heb ik de afgelopen twee jaren veel tijd, moeite en geld in NLGgestopt om dat ik erin geloofde dat NLG een verschil kan maken. Toch zijn er afgelopenweek dingen voorgevallen die mij hebben laten besluiten om me helemaal uit de NLG community terug te trekken. NLG is niet meer hetgeen waar ik twee jaar geleden veel potentie in zag.Ik zal zodra de kans zich voordoet (voornamelijk bij het vervallen van een domein) dediverse projecten die ik nog steeds beheer ontmantelen. Daarnaast zal ik ook geen gestikkerde euro's meer in omloop brengen en de poolserver voor Guldenminer zal offline gaan.Dit bericht is meer ter informatie en niet een reden om een discussie met mij te openen.Met vriendelijke groet,BioMike My personally developed PriceAPI does that: http://ercinee.eu/Payment system is also on the planning, but other things need to be done first. The mining pool (which is GHash.io) has dropped below 50%. Question 1: The solution Gulden uses. From what I understood, they checkpoint at each block. This in fact prevents orphaning of the chain, but IMHO also makes the whole chain less flexible.[edit]It is also a centralized solution.[/edit]Question 2: The thing that is important is the chain which provided the most work wins. If someone has 51% mining speed he could send a transaction, start mining in a separate chain (not broadcasted to the real chain), transaction is confirmed (and the transaction is not further looked at), the attacker now broadcasts his longer chain without the initial transaction. He now has 1) his "never send" coins, plus 2) the results of the invalidated transaction (for example funds on an exchange). Yes, you are correct. I made a thinking error here. I have to rethink my monitoring software. Thank you for pointing this out. I'm developing monitoring software, and noticed this when I started it this morning. While this is Â something we don't really want, it is currently the reality. That's why I'm giving this warning. I guess it will happen more often in the future.If people want to protect themselves against a double spend attack, people should at least wait for a block found by pools AYovB1fohMrn7FSnVF8iDAJzVQvY7D8ykr or AHA5ib4eehh5Gkonv4ZPMZDz3zTS5wn6X5 (together about 40% hash rate) before confirming a transaction. The first one is my own private pool, the other is AURpool, which is run by LTEX (dev team member). People should be cautious when receiving coins. One miner (AVNY6cjEbr3GRaXeFHrxtzAAsWfn8eg53Y) has >50% hashing power.I would like to ask the pool owner mining to this address to contact me. According to their chat, other coins seem to have such problem as well (so not sure if there is really problem or just no sell orders). My guess was always that the depth chart is buffered (it always lags). See how/if it catches up. As far as I remember the "free withdrawal tickets" are a gift from Cryptsy (Every other exchange just charges withdrawals). Normal withdrawal rates are calculated with what is being paid out. In your example it would be the "first consult would be free", but except having a 3h consult, the lawyer has other things to attend to and terminates the consult after 1.5 h. Same here. This afternoon my personal pool had about 35% hashrate. Another jumppool also about 35%, rest was divided among 3-4 other pools. I'm building software to monitor this type of data, so that's why I know. People using the CEX.IO exchange, please withdraw your AUR, as it will be delisted due to GHash.IO multipool suspension! Ok "Knab" also reacted that their "financial and customer services have not been adjusted to my type of transactions" and cancelled the account.Next in line is SNS Bank (http://www.snsbank.nl). I had contact with an other entrepreneur and he said he had no difficulties with them. @RealBitcoin: I think it is more that they don't understand crypto's or are not bothered by it.@Cryptology: Yes, that is something I'll try if it doesn't work here in the Netherlands. I do prefer a Dutch bank, because it would be easier communicating with them (my German is not that great). I'm in the process of starting a cryptocurrency related company (the company exists, but need a business bank account to operate) and had my first block last week when trying to open an account with "ABN-AMRO" (my personal bank) in the Netherlands. Their statement boiled down that they choose to not open new accounts for companies dealing with crypto's. Accounts that were already opened before their policy change could continue to operate. Their policy is however open for change in the future.Yesterday I opened an account with "Knab" in the Netherlands as well, but it is still under supervision of approval (I also asked an employee through their chat system, but she couldn't tell if it would pass their checks). Gulden is now supported in the Ercinee PriceAPI: http://ercinee.eu/ and https://github.com/BioMike/PriceAPIPeople are free to use the API in their projects.Ercinee can be followed on twitter for updates regarding this: @EcineeCrypto I'm proud to announce the initial release of our priceAPI.It provides an easy to use API to obtain the current spot price of Auroracoin in BTC, ISK, EUR and USD.Documentation and links can be found on the following website: http://www.ercinee.eu/Suggestions for improvement are welcome.
1. and 2. Not sure what you mean with that. Block reward is currently 12.5 AUR.3. 80 blocks (See: https://github.com/aurarad/auroracoin/blob/master-0.8/src/main.h)4. As that is an increasing number, check: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/aur/ (Outstanding figure is the amount of AUR in circulation if I'm correct). I think one of the few things left was some testing.... why he put it on hold... just check back a few pages. I think you can get paysafecard in the US (did a check on New York)... going through paysafegulden would be the easiest then. Coin is active and running: http://seeds.auroracoin.is/ (This monitoring software is something I made recently for AUR, but other coins can join to improve it).Foundation team members are working on a AUR-ISK exchange, which goes into testing soon. (See the post earlier about this)A member of the foundation has been in contact with the Icelandic tax office for discussing VAT in relation to Auroracoin (http://auroraspjall.is/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=288)A member of the foundation will be speaking on a Icelandic conference hosted by sky.is, The Icelandic Computer Society, on Crypto currencies on the 18th of November.A few other things are also in the process, but not worth mentioning yet. My experience with Cryptsy withdrawal is the same. It is possible, but takes some time to withdraw everything. I guess that it is due to the recent "developments" around the exchange, which caused a sort of bank run (with most of the coins in cold storage). Their interface has been improved past few months, which makes it better in use. The dev team is trying to get it relisted on Poloniex, so if people want to help getting AUR listed on a second exchange, please do so: https://poloniex.com/coinRequestThis is what the dev team is aiming for. Use in Iceland, their situation is unique in this.One thing we notice is that still many people are using the old wallet, please update! http://auroracoin.is/ If you see mining as a source for inflation, than fiat currencies have an infinite inflation (Central banks can always print more). Cryptos don't have an inflation (but deflation) when there is no way of create more than the maximum amount of coins that will ever be into existence, it is already calculated into the current market price.This points also a problem to give an answer to the person that asked the question regarding this. There is NO WAY, for ANY crypto, to measure this. First, to measure it, you need an economy and goods where the price is based on the crypto (not some recalculation from fiat based on market value). Second, the market price is just too volatile.For these reasons, I think the whole inflation discussion is BS. That's just all assumptions (both from my and your side)... and a discussion I don't feel like having (I didn't want discuss AUR matters here as it is off-topic). My experience so far is that the AUR foundation is not slowing development. I speak from a personal point of view. If team members say they are busy IRL, I don't question that. Everyone should do what they think is right. If spending more time with family, work or study results in lesser productivity in our team, well so be it. I don't feel like having a contest about which team is the most busiest IRL.That's all I'm going to say about it. I just mentioned how things run at AUR how I see it, by no means I wanted to compare it with NLG (I don't know how busy the NLG dev team is). EFL wouldn't have gotten anywhere even without a foundation, so that is a bad excuse.AUR has a foundation because the Icelandic people wanted a central body for the Icelandic media and government to contact, and to host the part of the premine, as its unknown creator wanted. Iceland also has strict currency laws, which needed to be sorted out. The Netherlands don't have them. We communicate with them about possible development decisions, and we want to have them make some, but if they don't decide anything the other non-foundation members have just as much to say about it. The slower pace of development is not due to the foundation, but many of the development members are often busy IRL (I am also busy with NLG, spreading my limited time between the two), and we had a legacy to handle, which has been a bit inconvenient. The things I'm currently developing for AUR can also be used for NLG, but for some things we have to reinvent the wheel as the code is not freely available (e.g. the seed node monitoring system). LTEX is not my leader and don't pull AUR in this. It has NOTHING to do with it. Stop spreading FUD. The dev team is currently leading NLG, nobody else. We just want them to do a proper job and raising questions about issues we see and propose possible solutions. Thank you for recognizing our concerns. Looking forward to the statement. I hope we can continue the discussion afterwards, when things remain not clear. LTEX, I and a few others just want a civil discussion about things that worry us (and holds us back in doing things for NLG) and how the team would handle the obvious problems when they arise. The foundation was proposed as one of the many solutions, not THE solution. Yet, we only receive negative sounding comments from the dev team about how bad this one solution is.If the dev team doesn't want this discussion, I'll get the hint (I don't speak for others). Just say it, then I know I have to obey the benevolent dictator. I made it clear that it would be better to pack the organisation in a legal entity (whether that is a foundation, "vereniging" or "cooperatie" remains open for me) for various reasons. One thing, for example, I asked Rijk about is the taxes that he possibly has to pay over the pre-mine, due to the fact that it is in his possession (it is part of his wealth under the current construction). If he is not paying tax over it he is evading taxes, which is possible punishable by Dutch law. I have yet to hear about this from him. Other things happening in his personal environment (accidents, legal problems, financial problems, marriage/divorce, etc.) could also have consequences for the pre-mine.What is done within the legal entity remains open for discussion for me, but as long one natural legal entity (currently Rijk) is the thing controlling NLG by law, NLG remains vulnerable. This is what worries me (and I guess also LTEX, who started this). From a development point of view this might not be a good decision (as MaNI and c_e_d claim, I'm not sure about that), but from a investing (not the speculation mentioned here often) point of view it would reduce uncertainties quite a bit.And people mentioning the Bitcoin foundation... it wasn't initiated from the community. They were just some (shady) CEOs of Bitcoin companies that tried to influence Bitcoin through that structure. Should have let it crash back to 500sat. to complete the M. Really... put your scalebar on 1 week... No mooning (ugh... don't look it up on Google) below 1500sat... okay? Good luck http://nlgstats.nl/richlist/ : You will find one address at place 27, but I've used more addresses over the time. Coins have been moved around, a few have been spend... so the rich list won't tell you that much. I can guarantee you, they weren't. Pre-mine accounting can be tracked here: https://developer.gulden.com/premine/ Me and a few others gained all those coins protecting NLG against Clevermining last year by throwing shit loads of hashes against it to keep the chain going. We mined them against a huge loss (buying them at the exchanges would be much cheaper at that time), selling them now would still result in a loss. We are THAT dedicated to NLG. NLG was never a scam and never will be one, period. Do note that a new version will be released on Monday, which contains some bug fixes. The easiest would be to download the Linux client from: https://gulden.com/nl/downloadUnzip it to a local folder and run it.
Skippy ball. Within 3 hours.  To supplement to this, the following disclaimer:I was the one who pushed the coin up to almost 1500 sat two times, yesterday evening and last afternoon. Nobody else was involved with this. I hope most of you enjoyed the ride (and seeing the comments I think people enjoyed it). However, this has some effect on the market, which I would like to clarify:1) I bought from a separate account, than the one from the stabilization software. During the pumps the software was in operation and has increased its balances due to this action for some significant amount. I had to combat my own software, which was a nice stress test in the process.2) The price gravitated lower before the buys, after the initial buy up, some increase could be observed, which I hope will also continue for the next few days. My guess is there was a surplus of coins being traded, which have been removed from the market now.3) I will keep these NLG from the market for now and see how things develop. If the price keeps increasing (too much) I will slowly sell to cater the growth of the coin... or I just buy pizza's for it through Nocks... or use in some sort of project.  Changelog? [Gordon Ramsey-mode]Oh.. F*ck me... was that really needed to be said?[/Gordon Ramsey-mode] LTEX can defend himself... no need for me to help him (I'm not his B*tch  ). This is not one person, but multiple persons that have these same issues with the dev team. DeVries has had contact with WaterLooDown, describing the same problem, which lead to him decide to shut down the community forum and leaving the community. This is as recent as it can be. Maybe contact WaterLooDown for details.I skip the mentioned instance, because I don't want to derail the conversation.Most of the people I'm talking about don't want things their way per se. But valid questions that are raised should be answered when raised and not ignored.Yes, even open source code have a license which tells you who the owner is (copyright holder), but grants rights to others. Linus Torvalds can't do sh*t when he wants Ubuntu or Redhat to prevent them from doing certain things (as long as the license is respected). Which is IMHO a more suitable example compared to what we are discussing here. Another example is the BSD networking code in the old MS Windows versions. I read those PMs as your complain that the software was preventing the price going up to higher. I guess I misread that. I also remembered someone (and I thought it was you, but can't find any reference for that any more) asking me to remove high sell orders earlier this year. Sorry for that misunderstanding. The IPO was completed before the price increase (did the maths at 520 sat, where an offer of 500 sat was made). When I funded a large part of the iOS wallet development costs the price was much higher than the market price.My point is that I want the time, money and effort invested in NLG is respected. Questioning decisions is part of that from my side, you have only been nagging me about price not going to the moon. We are just critical and not someone who always says yes. @MaNI, so if you consider yourself as part of the whole team. What's your opinion about the community members that feel like they are ignored and held back by the dev team? How do you as a team plan to improve that? The discussion about IPO for the iOS app is just one example, the problem is (and long time has been) bigger than that.And don't use the open source of the wallet as an excuse for guarantee that everything will be fine, you should know better that that is a false excuse. Yeah... an IPO below market price... sure that fills up quickly. And that is the most clichÃ© picture about the Netherlands. There is so much more beyond Amsterdam.  There are people who actually want NLG to be more than what it is now, they don't want to take 10 years for it to get somewhere. They want to do it in 3-4 years. They offer help, resources and connections.... yet the dev team decides to do everything by themselves without communicating to those people. They are ignored. From a dev team that claims to be listening to the community. LTEX is one of those people. He doesn't ask for anything except some cooperation/support from the dev team regarding some matters. Seems reasonable to me, but I guess that is too much to be asked.Example: We have 3 Subways accepting NLG. LTEX arranged a phone list with all other Subways in the Netherlands that he can call, but he needs qualified people to answer possible questions from the franchise holders or at least have a line where he can relay questions or help with implementation for those Subways to accept NLG. He is still waiting for months for an answer regarding this from the dev team. @LTEX, finally the credit you need!!!  Nope, that question is not important. This is now the 3rd time (first criptoe, then new official forum, now this) in 1 year that this "power struggle" surfaces... get the hint, or check back in this thread (which has been in English mostly). These power struggles have been going on already for some time. DeVries thinks people should be using the official forum, instead of his more popular one (some people even thought it was the official one), because it would be better for NLG. The complaint is that dev members don't answer user questions on his forum or actively participate in that community. So, to answer your question, the lack of dev members saying something is the problem. Many people on his forum don't agree with his decision. There is a nice button for that below his name. And don't quote trolls, don't give them that credit. F*ck ups can be made in many points down the line, even if the PRNG, or the encryption algos are not compromised by a three letter governmental body. Just a small example to illustrate (introduced by a Debian "developer", in OpenSSL, which doesn't even touch the Linux PRNG and kept undetected for 1,5 years.):https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/05/random_number_b.htmlSchneier has more insights on this subject. He wanted to know the best way to get as much NLG as possible for his bucks.<edit>Or he already bought all into it... and wants to pump it further to cash out. 4 mil wall guy?</edit> The problem is... his opening post and some comments later show that he doesn't know what he is doing. He didn't do his homework. 
My software can't do magic. The recent rise has already taken a hit on its effectiveness and needs time to recover. The amount of NLG traded past few weeks is huge compared to the walls it can currently put up. It build up nice walls in the 700-750 and 800-850 tranche, which would turn in a nice support when we start to tackle the 999sat wall. I just wrote down a list why you could speculate on NLG... but maybe it is better to stay with BTC if the "home work" on finding out why is too much work for you. Really, it's not that hard. Warren Buffet eh... he will never get into crypto. He doesn't "invest" into things he doesn't understand or has a solid financial basis. Exchange with NLG-EUR pairing! And we get Guldex... all we need. Someone who pushes such wall up every time the price rises.... will never sell. The software has an order at 1000 sat at that point... that 40BTC order isn't mine. We want to get rid of the old wallets (so we can push notifications in the future when people need to update), we don't have the keys for the old wallets to do this. There will always be a few nodes that will never upgrade. We decided to restrict the connections between the old and new wallets to facilitate this and have a smoother chain fork in the future. Past few weeks I've been working on software to track the health of our seed nodes. Today we hooked up all the seed nodes to this new monitoring system. People can see the status of our seeds at http://seeds.auroracoin.isThe software for this monitoring system has been made free under the GNU Affero General Public License so other cryptocoins can use this software as well and collaborate in improving the system.Source: https://github.com/BioMike/seed-node-monitorIf people are wondering which node is the bridge node, its "USA West", visible due to the high amount of wallets which haven't been updated yet. A new wallet has been released on 17 August 2015: http://auroracoin.is/Please update. I think not enough coins are produced for that. Take into account that with the recent rise that it attracts more speculators... and people owning coins are holding them. We're on a bumpy way going up. Weekends are now apparently for staying on the same level. Some services (e.g. Nocks) don't wait for a few blocks to pass before continuing with their service. As soon as they see the transaction they act (and need to for their service to work). Cancelling transactions would more or less mean that those services can't exist. People waiting for their salary after the ING f*ck-up yesterday.  Correction to 500-550 range would be healthy though. Hello, top address here... no, I won't dump. It will be used to prevent P&D schemes and to stabilize the price in the long run (about 3 mil. of that has been sold while going up and put in as support). The Netherlands accepts so few refugees, our country will hardly notice. There is so much scaremongering in the media regarding this. Some countries could get a bit more problems, but if you handle the refugee problem correctly it should have hardly an influence on the economy of a country. The whole world economy is due for a recession soon. Europe took too long from recovering from the last one... so thing will get pretty bad here. The whole "the economy is going great" good news show in the media these days is just a way of preventing that (and the politicians are just ignorant)... not sure if they will have much success with that. The Netherlands are just too dependent on export. To add to this:For the coin to grow, it needs healthy order books with enough depth. I'm providing this. People can buy or sell goods with a BTC value worth of a few BTC without influencing the price too much. No merchant is going to use a coin if its value goes up or down 200% in the time of 10 minutes.If you think the price is worth at least 700 sat... then please, buy as much as possible. They are dirt cheap at current price then. Those Greek issues aren't solved, only extended. New "issues" will arise, look at China, nicely timed at the end of an economic cycle. The question is if the communist government will do a better job correcting the market that the capitalist west has been unable to do for the last few decades (they are doing already a better job at it, but will they succeed). Then there are the other BRICS-countries, where some are already seeing problems in their economy. Did they trademarked it?
Also, our chain got unstuck last night. Things are running again. Currently nothing more than trading. We're in the process of building up infrastructure. The only thing you can do is trade them or help us and use them later in Iceland (or Icelandic web shops). Client reports 50GH/s. I think the 1.5Th is a bit off. Also, it's an estimate. My guess is a jump pool (wrongly configured one?), raised the diff 40 fold: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/aur/We're already waiting for the next block for 19 hours. W00t!!!@LTEX, no thank you... too much honour. That more or less explains it. There are multiple advantages for NLG in this. Larger order books, so people can actually buy or sell larger quantities without affecting the price too much, as veertje explained, is one. The other is that it prevents people to manipulate the price by placing buy or sell walls and move them as the price responds to them.The software runs at itself, over multiple exchanges, doesn't do any TA and feeds back into itself. The trenches are chosen in such way that it also allows traders to make a nice buck. I've been very open about this and in the end it will make NLG a stronger coin. The 450 wall is peanuts compared to the one at 350 yesterday. Sure it will... but what is the logic of a dead cat bounce in an upgoing market? Please explain, I would like to know. The sell wall by my stabilization software absorbed most of the buying power and prevented the price to jump too high. Upgrade your wallets, the new version contains a new list of seed nodes. Most of your questions can be answered by the OP and http://auroracoin.isAs far as I know there are no places outside of Iceland to pay with AUR, but in the dev team we hope to get some international oriented Icelandic based companies to accept AUR for their international payments in the future. This as part of the plan to get more AUR flowing back into the Icelandic economy. Thank you for letting us know. I've added it to our timeline on http://auroracoin.is/ Code base has been updated to 0.8 litecoin code base, new UI and a new list with active seed nodes (to help people download the block chain more easily). Check the github repo for details (it's all in there). So, total amount of coins will stay the same? Thank you for that. AUR has currently hardly an economy. Current price is based on speculation/hodling. With low supply it is easy to pump/keep price high. The high price doesn't reflex its value. While it doesn't need more coins for what we want to do with it (use in Iceland), a bit more AUR would be a luxury. Marketcap isn't also a holy value... it hardly means anything in the crypto world (due to speculation), yet people focus too much on it. Price vs. value... I keep pointing this out... we can pump the price all we want, but value is what we need to build (for IRL usage). This is why we are at 300 sat.But, as people don't want this discussion any more.... I made my points clear. I'll stop the discussion. Nope, only 2 people (me and someone else) that bought all the dumped coins then. Now other people are buying most of the dumped coins. So we forgot about Clevermining already? Supply was more or less the same (this was before DIGI). This is why we don't need changes in block reward or halving. Current price is very stable and IMHO reflects its real value. This price level can be supported easily for the next few years without major problems.Got proof for those claims? You can't just extrapolate prices. We need investors that help build the coin, not speculators that want to rip value out of NLG. Only then a higher price is justified. Fair enough. I've apologized to Jero for my comment earlier and I'm going to take a time-out for a few days to calm myself regarding the discussion earlier.
Nobody using Bitcoin, Litecoin, DOGE... I guess Define "success" and which formula? Thank you MaNI for clearing that up. The whole "no block reward halving" situation was not clear to me (I just heard about it yesterday as it was for me not clearly mentioned in the initial text I read about the change) and I assumed there was no end point set. I personally still think this is not the way to go, the easiness in which people accept changes to coin characteristics worries me. Well, in the long run it will move towards 0% (no halving of the block rewards any more, so infinite NLG). From what I get with this discussion is that game rules will be changed contentiously and there are no guarantees for the future. NLG will also be worth less over time. I don't see any disagreements. I'll know what to do. 1) Intrinsic value doesn't change, when that increases you could more easily overshoot the gulden price (and possibly larger swings on the market). You could overcome some of these problems by keeping the total amount fixed, but the fact is this adoption creates problems of it own.2) This interference isn't necessary. It is that people don't trust the "marktwerking" (supply and demand) that is in play or would rather want to have the price pumped to a specific level by reducing the supply. You're speaking to the owner of that address. I've made it a dozen times clear that it is used in my stabilization software that should prevent people pumping and dumping the coin. Those coins are mostly not on the market, and will flow into the market as it grows. In long term the dumping is not a problem. We're just 1,5 year in the run and people are panicking that it isn't worth 50 euro's each like every other scam coin. Have people lost faith in NLG that much, that they see manipulation as the only solution? We have a lot of NLG mined and instadumped. That is why we see lower rates. Plus, services as paysafegulden are still offline, making it hard to move Euro's into NLG easily. Thank you for the offer, but I think a complete independent service would be better. The implementation of the payment processor around it isn't the hardest part, most time I've spend in the security model to do cross server communication around it (which is completely different from what people are used to). There is a risk that people will not use this, because it is too hard to setup (it requires some additional dependencies on the webserver hosting the webshop). I'll see how things develop. I think you could, but you would need to find a way to generate addresses and confirm payments.I'm currently working on a NLG-only payment processor myself, but I need a bit more time to fully implement and test it. It will also work a bit different (through an API, so as a customer you'll never be redirected to the payment processor). I was able to withdraw them without any problems. Comkort is closing, withdraw your NLG if you still have some there: https://comkort.com/blog/news/comkort_close Miners dumping at buy order book and users putting in low buy orders knowing that they will be filled. It's the miners losing due to this, and not a problem. https://guldencoin.zone/threads/development-feedback.81/#post-883 @Rijk, what are the plans for the gratisguldencoin.nl domain? That was not said by the foundation, or dev team, but people speculating on the coin. Get your facts straight. Great, now I'm stuck with a big amount of "useless" euro coin stickers (pointing to gratisguldencoin.nl)? Can we at least have that domain pointed to somewhere useful? Gazo is easily kicked off the chain if people start to put some dedicated hashes on to the network. A 2GH/s contract expired at occurred at 07:35 pm. This was the largest single drop
My hashing contribution is now down to 180MH/s. Gewoon een initieel bedragje.  Interesting, anyway a good place to send some coins to from time to time.[edit]Ook wat alvast verzonden[/edit] I was Friday on the train station and there was an announcement that people only could buy tickets with coins (because the NS doesn't accept bills in their ticket vending machines). Count that up to the fact that PIN on average doesn't work two times a year.... recipe for financial disaster. Personally, I think Auroracoin should stay out of politics. Parties accepting it is fine though. Keep in mind that we have currently a lot of temporary dedicated mining going on. That will reduce over the course of the evening. Both Firefox and SeaMonkey at home show this problem. Tried Firefox at work today, there no problems. Tried it earlier, but only a white screen (have that also with other Insight explorers (for other coins)). Any idea why it might not be working? Funny you made that comparison. Bitcoin was also started by an unknown author, who disappeared and there is a huge amount of pre-mine that has not been accounted for... you're saying Bitcoin is also a scam?As for everyone else:If you want the proof why AUR isn't a scam, check the AUR thread. Discuss AUR there, not here. None of the NLG dev team members are AUR dev members. Community members don't need to be dev members, keep the two thing separate. The only other option would be going on holiday there.  I'm for more options. Also made a post on the official forum: http://auroraspjall.is/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=135 Maybe make a specific topic on the official forum to discuss this in detail. Looks like a dust collection script.Not sure why one would have so much dust in a single address,but it could be possible. Nobody knows for sure about Satoshi, neither do we from Baldur. But both seemed to wanted to do something groundbreaking, but didn't feel comfortable being in the spotlight for that (can understand with Satoshi... all the fanboyism that was here, plus maybe a bit of fear from groups that might not like his idea of giving people control about money). Same reason why Satoshi gave up on Bitcoin. I'm actually doing this already for NLG and have the same plans for AUR, but will be more difficult (so that will take time). Price manipulation will be easier if there are more exchanges (asks will be spread, but not much more, making it easier to pump the price). But I'm not against more exchanges per se, but against asking/paying them to get listed. Plus there will be a third exchange any way (based in Iceland). Why do we need it? Yes. Well, new dev team that wants to build a community of users. We're already 1 month between 400 and 500 sat. Seems pretty stable to me (including the order books) and could be an indication that people are actually using it instead of pumping and/or bag holding.
Don't get me wrong. There is a reason why I'm selling on the way up (that's half the story). Let's say it is part of infrastructure building. I'm seriously selling on the way up. To be honest, current price is already way to high for its current real value. A bunch of bag holders of overpriced coins isn't adding to its intrinsic value. @Eggert, building a good coin takes time. Check Guldencoin, that has done the concept of a country coin right (even with a big premine). A dedicated team and a community that wants to help building it is all we need. We don't need pumpers and dumpers, we don't need "investors" that want to profit as much as possible at the expense of the coin, and we certainly don't need FUD. If there is FUD, let us know what, so we can resolve that. Big bag holders aren't a problem. They will dump at the right price, which will be absorbed by the market. Sorry to disrupt the party, but "moon" is not the goal. Every Icelandic person using it is. If that is at the current price, so be it. No idea, but he repeats that sentence every month or so. In the mean time I have made more with selling and rebuying. But my guess is we wont get near 75k anytime soon. My guess is that the upgrade didn't go like planned. That could be epic. If transport costs are not too high. There, fixed that for you.You're taking them serious?... they forgot to register their name for a website and it was scooped the same minute they posted their name here. And then from someone that just registered on the forum to put that message here. Does it all matter if it is a scam or not? Coin is currently "dead". New dev team takes up "dead" coin, kicks out "scammers" (block pre-mine) and starts to build up. What's the problem?I guess the people calling "scam" here, don't have any AUR, so what is in it for them? I think you can buy prepaid visa cards at the shops (Primera, Bruna, etc)Â  these days. They would work like a credit card. Not sure though, so check on that. I guess I misread your post, but the Icelandic government doesn't need to hold any coins. Icelandic people need to hold (and more important, use) them. 1 AUR, like any other coin, can be divided up to 10^8 smaller parts... how would that not be enough? Same BS argument could be said for BTC (if it would be distributed worldwide).BTC has a lot of negativity outside of the cryptocommunity, that would be the strength of AUR. Not sure about the 1 usd (or 1 eur for that matter), anyway not soon. But along the way the future looks good. But that is my opinion, what do you think for yourself? I just hope I didn't insult Italians on this forum by saying this.  LTEX: still got free pizza's left for hungry NLG users?Ordered a Pizza (Shoarma Hawaii with lots of garlic sauce) through Nocks.nl at Thuisbezorgd:https://nocks.nl/success/ce624eff2a865705f0606430033f80daNLG tx: 404901ea0f3f6f1571329e4f8ec0fe779ad788e01e2f1096ddd13102b38c2238It was very tasty! I'm Dutch as well, and live close to LTEX (we are planning to meet tomorrow). Big bag holders sell when the price goes up. It's up to the Icelandic people to get hold of them en get them into Iceland and start using them. There should be one running at: 94.242.229.111:12340Else give it time, there is a lot of ip-junk in the address list, but also a few valid ones. Also the IRC connect still seems to be working. I was able to connect wallets to the network without any problems.[edit]my current list shows:157.157.177.246:1234054.201.183.106:1234071.175.81.45:1234089.160.199.64:12340[/edit] Even if the pre-mine is dumped on the market... it will be absorbed over time. Personally I think it is just a minor problem, even if it is a problem at all. Bitcoin is far from stable and AUR has the possibility to become something great, but the Icelandic people need to trust it. LTEX made a generalization here, others like me, not me. 
Where exactly did I say I left NLG for AUR? Or are you "kicking me out", just like LTEX? The whole reasoning that a person can't work on two things is flawed (I decided not to start on that troll image a few posts back). If it wasn't clear to everyone, LTEX and me are more of the investor type of contributors (not speculators, told the difference couple of times), we have shown this a couple of times (Rijk knows this). Diversifying is a strategy to spread risk. We are also signalling problems with this DEV team, this has been discussed back and forth and back again, but hardly any action has been taken (I'm glad MaNI has created a separate repo now). These problems are for me a reason to diversify, if AUR is a good choice in that...well, time will tell. We are not power hungry and we don't want to lead this project. What we want is that the people pulling this project act in a responsible and predictive way. Past few months it became clear to me that this team lacks some qualities in that respect.I decided to give the team it wants, a decentralized community. This also means I'm not actively communicating on the official forums any more (which is a centralization in itself). It also gives me time to actually do stuff (going through a difficult and busy time IRL at the moment). Thank you! Great to know there is more. According to https://github.com/nlgcoin/Guldencoin nothing has been done since the DIGI update 3 months ago. Ah... man... was this needed? Guys, both of you, start to act professional.To everybody else, start getting used to this. This won't be the last flamewar over here (would be nice if they could keep it to the official forums). A long time ago there was an extra tax of 0.25 cents (a "kwartje") per litre petrol/gas (for your car) introduced (at that time by prime minister Kok, hence the name "kwartje van Kok"), with the promise it was temporary (if I remember correctly). This still needs to be "returned" to the car users and in that time people got the feeling they were ripped off by the government. In discussions about taxes/prices on gas/petrol this comes up every time (Dutch petrol/gas has the highest tax in the world, about 60-70%)... The site LTEX releases pays 0.25 NLG (a "kwartje") back for every litre tanked. I don't think that would work... Bitcoin is a nice proof of this (not the only one though). You mentioning that he hasn't been on the forum for a long time... did someone contact him? In case he was just busy with more important IRL things. Interesting read, but the proposed monetary system has some flaws... banks are reduced to administrative accounting institutions (they don't really handle the money anymore) and a party could potentially have a strong influence in the government and the money creation group (or have pawns at those places), which would mean unlimited free money for that party (and another financial crisis).@LTEX, any info on how you want to achieve point 2? Are you just going to forbid the transfer from that/those address(es)? No way to register? Thank you, so if I'm correct there will be about 7.5 millions AUR left to mine. Is there a place where I can find coin characteristics? (Mainly max coins in existence, now and in the future, when they are all mined) Build the client and currently syncing the blockchain. I don't have much developing time to help out (NLG is my current focus), but are there small quick things/tasks that I can help out with? Like I said, only Rijk and Geert-Johan are NLG core team members (not sure about MaNI, c_e_d is a temporary dev), rest is just active community members. Wachwoord laten resetten met je email adres. 400sat. here we come  They have been responsible with the premine. They deserve credit for that and even allowed funding community projects with those, in that sense they were listening to the community. But that is more the exception.Only Rijk and Geert-Johan are on the forums. According to Rijk, the others are only involved at some times with NLG.Roel is not a dev member. Just a very active community member.Same as Roel, although he often releases more "official info" than the devs themselves. I agree, confusing.The community is doing a LOT (outside the dev team). What the devs do, the community does not know. The only way for us to check is not being used by the devs (dev branches on github, I suggested them to use them before, but they apparently decided not to for some unknown reason). They seem to have nicer weather than here in Holland (windy, cold and rainy). You're right. Seems like I shouldn't do quick sums in my mind early in the morning. I know and am relax.  If the devs would only start working together with that community... we could accomplish so much more. And now they singlehandedly changed the communities most important communication tool?
Hey troll, any other coin would have collapsed under its own weight by now. NLG is still here and this is nothing compared with a month ago. I think I already told Rijk this three times in the past year (last time less than a month ago). Nothing has been done with my suggestions. It's also the same reason the Criptoe team "left" us. Solving the problem? Can't without the devs cooperation, so why bother.  Markanth, it seems that the cumulative percentage of blocks is dropping. Are there new parties mining NLG? Alle verandering is wennen. Mijn zorg zit bij de gebruiksvriendelijkheid. Dit forum? oogt nog al "techneutisch", het oude forum zit toch dichter bij wat veel mensen kennen. Maar ik heb het nog niet kunnen testen. https://community.guldencoin.com/t/welkom-op-het-nieuwe-community-platform/8Nou, vooruitgang kan ik niet direct zeggen... we zullen zien. Ehhh... ok. Moet ik opnieuw registreren? (Kom niet ingelogd en op het oude forum kan ik niet posten. Fail.)[edit]Laat maar. Wachtwoord moet worden gereset.[/edit] If people really want NLG they will start outbidding each other... they won't stay below 600 sat. Also, the other MPs don't seem to be so trigger-happy on selling like Clever. If it's the tech what you want, copy it to a live and well supported coin. (IMHO wallets should get way more modular, useful features as "plugins".) No need to revive something dead. Nice to see more people here that think that way. People don't know the difference between speculation and investing. Part of the reason why so many coins fail and money is lost. Years it takes before all coins in those two chains are mined. Apparently that is the only determinant of adulthood of a coin. These "investors" should check themselves if the coin that they want to "invest" in is a sane idea to do (most coins are not), not because someone else tells them to do. There is always a trade off between risk and profit to be made. Investors 101 here and not really rocket science.Let these coins die or let them be for devs that want to experiment with them (they are good enough to use in testing new crazy ideas, and in case stuff breaks nothing is lost). For the English speaking people in the Netherlands, check the links if you are interestedin crypto/FOSS-related meetings (websites are in English): Looks still the same. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_guilder Don't worry. I will also split the walls over multiple exchanges. Pump? More a correction where it should be. I've already got a lot of sell orders on the way up, they will turn into support when sold. Nelis was not the only one, but had a large contribution to it. Also the scam origin of EFL is why many NLG contributors don't like the coin. Not so good relationship, to be honest. We had discussions before, but they always ended in flame wars, name calling, etc. Making a lot of claims, but don't back them with the "proof" he has. He is worried about a 70 sat drop in 24 hours. Bitcoin goes up and down 10 USD/EUR on a day... in his reasoning that is a scam coin as well. The proof I get from this is that he fails to understand how markets and economies work. Bleutrade allows you to trade them against NLG... if you want to get rid of them: https://bleutrade.com/exchange/EFL/NLG
Our awesome forum: https://forum.guldencoin.com/index.php Check out our community and see that NLG is more than some funny coin name, an anonymous dev and leeching "investors" hoping to profit big from pump and dump scams (and not care about the coin itself). Markanth, stats site seems to be offline. You're way too early. Chain is already slowly recovering. Clevermining has been hitting us hard again. They provided all the hashes that you see. See http://nlgstats.iblogger.org/ for more info about pool contributions. Veertje, you are doing what you shouldn't do. People unfamiliar with Guldencoin can't separate these links from virus containing ones (even I wouldn't be 100% sure). Doesn't it work via the key import in the debug console? https://forum.guldencoin.com/index.php?topic=273.msg7048#msg7048 (Point 10) I've started to do this (on coinmine), but needs to be balanced with dedicated hashes. With coinmine it seems other coins market price is also important, which is I think the main reason NLG doesn't get targeted there that often. On the other hand it seems that market price isn't that important to CM (we have seen them obtaining more blocks when price seems to go down, not sure about the BTC value). CM also doesn't seem to sell everything, as their exchange account (I assume) contains more than 3 mil. NLG. Thank you for looking into this Frais. I've already pointed some hashing power at CoinMine.pw, but it seems NLG is not really the most profitable coin most of the time. I would like to come into contact with the switching/multi pool admin with the address: Gazo1qWgAxtkRfapMjv6GQWJskeWTPWGkdPM me here or on the Guldencoin forum (same name). Getting more and more respect for Sterlingcoin. Maybe time for a Nocks-S? To cater our UK friends? Doesn't matter, don't care. Just ignore it. Yep, that's why I like that exchange.[edit]LOL, dumped some EFL (-a lot%), bots see that and more start dumping EFL.[/edit] http://nlgstats.iblogger.org/Lets hope things start to settle a bit (although blocks/day is still dropping). With Clever hitting the chain past months, there is enough NLG on the upside of the market to prevent pumps (although it could be spread a bit better). Don't worry. I also assumed it not to be more than a discussion. I think your points are valid and personally I feel that delisting will not directly improve things, as it might also damage dedicated miners.@Fuse, great updates! The drop in hash rate is, I think, mostly due to me expiring all of my mining contracts. I'm curious what will happen when this levels out (drop in hash rate). Would DIGI recover in this situation, or not? We've also been discussing non-coding solutions if the situation doesn't improve on the other forum. On the other hand... try to keep it delisted. Other users will be asking for listing it again. I've been thinking about this as a decentral exchange. Users run an exchange program (with both a NLG and BTC wallet), user places its orders in their own exchange program. Program announces itself somewhere and others can "visit" the exchange program to buy and sell NLG (or put it in a P2P net). Put a trust systems and/or escrow layer on top of it, for extra security. Highly trusted users could even allow EUR exchange (manual through their personal bank account). We have those already.
Just to be clear: NEVER send your wallet.dat file to anyone. Keep it private! The "wallet file" they are talking about is Guldencoin131.exe Or let /GeertJohan work on his simulator and have GuldenDiffAlgo, that will also work in future situations. @Fuse, I guess not many people have seen it then.[edit]I'm a bit surprised that all this "profit" for miners on CM was only from NLG. [/edit] This multipool has been on our chain already before DIGI, but didn't manage to get more than 10%. With the price rise yesterday I think things got more profitable for them (together with the hashrate drop by Frais and me that might even be more). Still, not as bad with Clever (they keep < 50% and block times are still reasonable). Gazo at 22% now. :/ I'm still very happy with DIGI. Current situation is better than the past few months. Please enlighten us with your explanation why this is. 3, 3.5, 4 minutes... nothing to worry about for guldencoin functionality. I did a quick calculation this morning. The change to 400 blocks would mean that the block time is about 30 seconds longer than target (so, 3 minutes instead of 2,5 minutes). Thank you for adding us. I'll have a look into the exchange. 849 sat is a nice price. Same here. But hashes are still better spread than 24 hours ago.  I guess Criptoe managed to profit from new miners coming in. Yep, but that will probably be a completely new algo, not some variation on DIGI. It is dropping again. Not sure what is causing that. Gazo is another one, but their ability to get blocks is way less than what Clever managed to get in the past. Both are at 11% together at the moment. 1) Block time of >30 minutes is still too long for me, to be honest. Diff extremes seem to be like pre-digi.2) Where did that 6GH/s come from? New dedicated miners?3) Are people on the other chain still able to send transactions? And get validations (by Clever)? Check back on their thread and see how they told us it was our fault being abused by CM. Well, let themselves find out their own fault of staying there. Ah, ok. Last time I checked coinmine it was only a few MH/s. So that explains. Yeah, but those can't make up 15% of the blocks, right? A few more hours. Hashes seem to spread nicely running up to the DIGI switch: http://nlgstats.iblogger.org/15% of the blocks are not accounted for, I guess it's in the other multipool(s)? Are we the first coin that kept stable (prise wise) under CM pressure? Or have there been others before?
To add to this, I'm currently renting a LOT of hashes to keep the negative effects of Clever down. If multipools drop from the chain after the switch I will also reduce the hashes I rent to make things more profitable for dedicated miners. If all the pools are updated, the old versions won't process transactions any more, right? So, that should not be a problem then. So Gazo is more directly competing with Clever? If that keeps Cever below 50% I'm fine with that, but better to have them all gone. Yep, and it will work... or not. They say they want to use the coin as a "savings" plan (read: store of value). But they don't seem to grasp the economy around it (I asked them multiple times, no answer). You need a solid bid order book for that, which they lack (or some other value insurance). Combine this with the "pump"-posts and other not so nice posts on their own forum, I would say stay away from it.The situation with EFL is now that a few entities contain almost all coins (which they paid a lot for to pump the exchange rate) and need to trick (nicest word I could find to describe this) people into buying them (with a coin that provides no added benefit over the hundreds of other coins), because else they are stuck with their overpriced coins (because they are the ones themselves who buy them).Now, check this: http://egulden.org/info/boekhouding/blockchain-in-beeld (last graph, gap times between blocks), see something familiar? And they are not even noticing it. Wow, just wow... and organizing these things isn't even rocket science. The OV-chipcard is a state-approved private monopoly. What you pay, is what you get (well, actually you get less, but nobody complains about that). I proposed this when bitcoin was just a few months old, but people thought it was a stupid idea. I have multiple anonymous OV-chipcards in my wallet (and use cash to charge them). Would be great if you could send empty ones to some place and order there a new one (which is pre-charged). Even the intrinsic value of the card (the 7,50 euro's that you use to buy them) could be refunded, based on the remaining age of the card (expiration date is on the back). And by using the card all over the country, it will be very hard for TLS to trace the card to a person. As far as I understood from Rijk legal issues / policy from Apple prevent release in other countries. I don't think plans were made for that (the guys from the other gulden might be there, they were talking a lot about that). Busted! There goes my plan for world domination.  (This is a small part of what I spend to push Clever back and will now be used to prevent the price from being pumped to fast.)I'd rather have that pool not listed there, as it serves a specific function and isn't suited for high end mining gear. I prefer to keep it semi-private (only for guldenminer). Look no further (site has been around for some time already): http://www.betalenmetguldencoin.nl We kunnen altijd meer hulp gebruiken.  Yeah, seems to be loading normal again. Is the Guldencoin forum having issues? Did someone already notify the various cryptocoin news sources? I think this is worth some media attention. The amount of energy consumption for maintaining a network could theoretically be just a few hundreds of watts (a fraction of the use of household). The economic competition is the cause of the waste of energy. Thank you LTEX to clarify the project to us. To get back to my point:With "more or less already running" I meant that all the details have been worked out (financial wise), else you wouldn't announce it.That having said, if they run out of "kwartjes" because the project is so successful I wouldn't mind giving them a little part of the pre-mine, but my opinion is that they have thought it out very careful and don't need it at this point. I think it should not be used for that. That project is more or less already running, so the financing for that should be sorted out already a long time ago. You should be able to BUY an airplane with NLG when it hits 1 USD.

How would such situation be resolved in non-digi algo's? I agree with this. Parsing data to different formats could be done by others in their language of choice. No need to do this in Go, which currently only one person in the community knows how to write.Just write all the data to a text file (even csv could be read by excel) and let other help in getting things going.I don't mind if we can get a confirmation on Digi working properly in the simulator in two weeks, or a custom algo in a month. What I don't want is to wait until 2016/2017 to have a fix. Depends on what "long periods of time" are. Check http://nlgstats.iblogger.org/ and see that recently the gap time has been 68 minutes as longest. That is less that before that (where long was multiple hours), if it doesn't become worse than those 68 minutes, I'm more than happy with it. Clever taking >50% and long block times.... or Clever only causing long block times. I would prefer the latter. I can move hashes around, but my point was to do this before DIGI kicks in. Hmm, one more problem when Clever gets kicked off the chain... Criptoe will get >50% of the hash rate. So, how long before we can download the new client? And the block where DIGI goes into effect? You contradict yourself a bit. You want it to survive, but don't put any hashes at it. To me it seems you're only in it for the profit, which isn't different than why Clever is in it.I started mining because of Clever, at a loss (and to be honest, I actually don't like mining that much). Various projects/merchants depend on a short block time, the remaining dedicated miners make sure that doesn't get too bad. I'm also not cashing out any NLG that I'm mining, which prevents the market from crashing. I also want this coin to survive, but at least I'm putting my money where my mouth is. These are the things that the simulator should be used for first and should be examined at a later point in time. Good things could be implemented then, things that don't matter could be left out.What's with the push for change, people? Why the need to copy every other coin? At least explain it shortly why we should consider it. Scrypt is not under discussion. It isn't broken, so why change it? /GJ, the reason why people vote for DIGI is that it is currently more certain as a "fix" (we don't know if it is 100% effective) than having a yet-to-be-developed GDR at some undetermined point in the future.People have offered help as much as they can, it seems that there is a better-than-DGW3 solution available, but we get very little feedback on those things. Everybody here feels that they are poking in the dark, not knowing what to do.As far as I know is that we could provide a DIGI implementation in GO, but nobody here knows how to use that language. So it has been suggested to hire a dev for that.
Please, don't touch the reward and the block time. That's something you do with scam coins, not guldencoin (and are, for me, in a way important determinants for trust in this coin). Maybe wait for a reply from /GeertJohan I don't think the update would need a coordinated fork. You could put the new algo in effect at a specific future block. Previous updates should give an indication on how quick updates are picked up by the users, based on that you could pick a block on when the algo change hits the network. I also would like to have a bit more news from the dev team (on a weekly basis would be nice). If they can't spend 30 minutes of their time to inform the community, I'm all for the change proposed by Fuse (I thought he could put in a pull request with a fix right now). To be honest, this should be solved anytime soon now. Would mid-January be a reasonable time to have something that puts Clever back? (I have still plenty of funds to keep the hashing baseline up, but the recent price increase hasn't been helpful. So, I'd rather have this solved sooner than later). Market looks fine to me. Op het andere forum is al contact gelegd met de redactie, we wachten nu hun reactie af. Negatieve reacties, waar dan? Ik zag eerst een link naar een pagina op de site om met paypal te betalen (zie die nu ook niet meer). Als het adres daaronder gezet kan worden (5 minuten werk), ben ik tevreden. Ik heb op het andere forum al gezegd dat ik het bedrag dat dan opgehaald wordt zal verdubbelen (tot half miljoen NLG max), maar wel met een adres op de site (vaak genoeg fraude met dat soort dingen gezien). Discussie hier voortgezet:https://forum.guldencoin.com/index.php?topic=733.0 Hoe verhoudt zich dit met SR14? Is dat er onderdeel van? Ik kon niet snel iets daarover op die website vinden. Blijkbaar staat hier er iets meer over: http://www.jarige-job.nl/Nu ik nog eens naar de website kijk, valt het kwartje. Kan je ervoor zorgen dat er een NLG adres op de website verschijnt (waarschijnlijk een beetje kort dag voor litebit integratie)? Ik maak geen donatie over naar een willekeurig adres hier op het forum. My guess is: http://www.hettafelhuis.nl/ (Regional TV/Radio)They seem to be occupied with SR14 at the moment? Thank you for those replies. Clever seems to jump in when the lower diff is too low (as we saw in Markanth's charts). How does this prevent from the diff getting too low?What are the effects on the block gap when Clever leaves again after mining two blocks? Does that stay in the hours range, like it does now when there are not enough dedicated miners? Yep, I saw it disappearing while looking at it. For some reason my first thoughts when I see this is "glitch in the software".Well, extra funds for mining next week. I wonder what keeps Clever down... so suddenly. Hashrate has gone up a bit last day (but also the market rate)... would that be it? Buying "Trust". Not going to waste money on that. Started to move some hashes from your pool to my backup pool and guldenpool. No, just asking. I'm currently pointing then to the 4096 port and that is already working fine. This will work better, hopefully.  Great! I will point Titan rigs to that. Is that a vardiff port? Yep, it's that. Plus a small bit extra for the risk I'm taking. There will be more of these sell walls on the way up. Yes! Prevented NLG from becoming a pump and dump scam coin! 
NOOOOOO, not my precious sell wall. (Ah, what the heck... I need the funds...  ) Place your bets!!!My guess: Sushi bar or Pizzaria! I vote for /GeertJohan of Guldencoin (The FB/Twitter requirement is lame). Need FB or Twitter for that? Lame. Markanth, thank you for your insight. I like the graphs. You can already see my effords in here, also the period where I needed to stop for some time. My point was always to raise the lows. NOMP pool software claims clever uses their software (I guess with their switching algo's). If it is funds you need to hire a dev to do this... count me in. I like the "Ga" in front... it means "Go" in Dutch. Go Hope! That's the address of the pool I set up. Feel free to include it in you stats (Call it "CPUminer").[edit]Doh... had to finish reading first before replying.[/edit] Best wishes from a 2 month old father. Enjoy your newborn. As you pool is working again, there is no need to advertise the backup I made (but it is in place for in the future, might something happen with the pool again).I will slowly move my hashes back to your pool again in the next few days. I've tried to "copy" Criptoes configuration for my own pool (so people only need to change the host URL). Currently testing, within a few hours people could switch to this pool for the time being. I'm fine with the current design. Back button? My browser has that, so that a website doesn't need it. X-factor, don't need it. I want to find the information I need, not some fancy X-factor that keeps getting in my way. Thank you for testing. Great that it works good. Just a quick note to others (I haven't mentioned this project here), this is in very early beta stage. So, what is holding you back to create such graph? BTW, it's NLG, not GLD. @/GeertJohan, Great! Good to hear something from the devs.That is not an explanation; that is your personal belief (and maybe parroting what other people told you).Â  An explanation requires to explain what it does and HOW it helps the price discovery mechanism, backed by proof. Nothing of that was in your post. One, f*cking big question: WHY?NLG is not going down. Buy them now while they are cheap... this isn't your average scam-pump-and-dump coin.Plus, if you really want to short NLG... ask the market places, not us. That's a no-go area... don't go there... that is a direct assault on the site and could get you in a lot of mess in many countries (even in the Netherlands). Even among the majority of IT people DDOS is NEVER an option. Wel de eerste fysieke plek waar je met NLG kan betalen in het buitenland.

And yet, we are still able to post here? If the mods really had something against NLG, they would have locked this ANN. Ik zag het ook staan, verbaasd me niet als dat een eis van de PVV was voor regeringsdeelname. I would like to nominate GeertJohan https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=554412.0 I can't code the solution (I don't write C) or host rigs at my place (not such a big house), but I can rent mining equipment... or not, which in that case Clever takes >90% until the algorithm is developed (my guess, it will take 3 weeks at least). Guess what that does to pools, markets and businesses when confirmations take >5 hours, that is also not good.Buying hashing power and dumping coins on the market is just a temporarily way of buying time until the algorithm is finished. I already looked this up:http://guldenpool.nl:27100/global_stats I've been thinking about how to go up in market price when clever is low... the only thing is to add hashing power. But that isn't really sustainable without an increasing flow of money into the hashing effort. Market price drops again and clever backs off to below 50% again. Dedicated miners (on criptoe and guldenpool) deserve a bit extra:Code:# /usr/local/bin/guldencoind sendtoaddress GceCqp5eLQ5jKPhBQe1E3g9qFN46sCSizo 10000.05d07d37cff6c94ea04c2c13bdff8b80ab1727463e010e32b2ad6235945e15259# /usr/local/bin/guldencoind sendtoaddress GZXckkrHVUbHdKtnD5u8Yz2yhB7x6Jtrks 10000.05837cf5a806d24ed3d599147c360f2b01eb97da6712839fbeb240da994ec4e3c# /usr/local/bin/guldencoind sendtoaddress Gd3KgQVKnSzAMLKw4Av7KyN4DjZSk6Zu1L 10000.0443bd67f3790089308cda0226a1d2dadefbecd428ca96aa11c01d6f9f75abe57# /usr/local/bin/guldencoind sendtoaddress GKF3aqPbWYfCsVfg9Fb5EcRd5R4Aivcsd2 10000.004f5c4b510839ca3b7fdb2f5da00cad24d3bc866fb59a4bb0e75ed5be88c98c6# /usr/local/bin/guldencoind sendtoaddress GcC5eVErzMZr72CSc5pVJdbaTXUBhZCKQc 1000.0dbebb8cf85d284267cde70159289251c70405458512e4c7c4a4257ccfb8fe16a# /usr/local/bin/guldencoind sendtoaddress GTumSsfv6dKUurP3va3adzWszRiUzJ6zkn 10000.04d73d78adaf4391a643639593e1af8da67ee5c58dfbfa66478873c69bc33ced4# /usr/local/bin/guldencoind sendtoaddress GP9pWRxr4AzLAmLmR6FstxEbxYAVkPL5o4 1000.0555dbe5051b9c4729dfbeb41d0c51d6285ee8301d4d4927de88b06dd86c31dc8 Simple, but elegant. I like that. Is a forced upgrade really needed for this? Clever would continue through older wallets, but as they would get more rare, they would be knocked from the network at some point. Problem with this is that it is not pooled mining, but solo CPU mining. Chances of getting NLG through this way are very slim. I've been following the discussion the past 24 hours and have some mixed feelings. My effort to push back clever below the 50% failed with the rise of the market price and following clever's hash rate (I assumed they put all their hashing power on NLG in that short time frame).None of the proposed solutions are ideal, and I change my opinion on the IP banning. While I don't like it, I like all the other suggested solutions less. The pro of this solution is that it is only temporarily, until the new difficulty changing algorithm is in place. Then clever can, IMHO, be unblocked again. The problem is how to get that implemented, IP addresses are not in the block chain, right? The thing that has been on my mind today is if I should continue buying the hashing power. I can sustain the current level for some time, but if clever increases their hashing power at higher market rate, I can't really follow much (assuming that the renting prise goes down due to higher bitcoin price). Which makes me thing if all this buying hashing power is really worth it. Do others think I should continue, or just stop it (and accept 3 hour block times). I think that wall will stay there for some time. Let's hope that means a higher price at the exchanges  Yeah, I noticed that as well. Could also be due to the temporarily higher rate at bittrex. Do they really have that much hashing power?<edit>Looked up on their site... 222GH/s is what they are doing.</edit> IP banning is not the solution, clevermining could easily setup a proxy, have a different IP and continue doing what it does. What surprises me is that this coin isn't too expensive for them to mine yet. Profitability must have dropped for them. And, are there other switching pools? If there are, they are most likely keeping them out. I try to keep doing this as long as my funds and personal situation allow it, but it is hard to keep the hash rate up (2 days ago clevermining managed to get >50% again) and finding time to do this is more challenging that the funds I have to do this. I'm fine with a "it's done when it's done", something the team has been pursuing from the start. I'd rather have them sorted it out right, before making a huge change again. I'm not a fan of huge changes every 2 months (that would make me loose trust in this coin). But I might PM GeertJohan when this is taking too long; for now I'm good. My only hope is that the community keeps doing, what it should do (getting more shops accepting NLG and building tools) and not panic too much over this hurdle.That being said, to continue on what Buerra said. I also know that CIG helped also with adding hash power to the network, but he seems to have stopped that some days ago. I know that he planned to work on something that could pull in a lot of hashrate to guldencoin, but haven't heard from him about that anymore. People can track my contribution by the address "GMxAVLQDLmsc4Q2aNxifyZqW6JRenK67hj" on both guldenpool and criptoe (I provide the majority of the hash rate (99%) there and both pools currently take about 50% together). Let him come. I need the BTC to sustain the hash rate to keep clevermining down. It started with clevermining dropping below 50%. Next resistance will be around 1800-1900 sat (I have a lot of large orders around that point as a result of pushing clevermining below 50%).
False positives. Just a quick post:People who want to validate guldencoin addresses in PHP can use the script that I have put here:http://www.betalenmetguldencoin.nl/code.php Ok, but giving them access to your account... isn't that a violation of the T&S of Twitter (or any online service that uses accounts)? Could that get your account suspended?<edit>I don't know anything about these things, just seems as an awkward way of working to me.</edit> Seems like a waste of money... Isn't that just a "number of followers" that will be increased (without caring or interested people behind it)? We had the RT exposure. http://nlgstats.iblogger.org/Clevermining below 50% for a couple of days now.  Sure, they are not the same. But, it all comes down to trust (how much do you trust the words of a/any pool owner that they wouldn't do a 51% attack). >51% is something no pool should be able to get at one point, that would be the best. We are currently unable to cope with clevermining's hashing capabilities... my worries are that things would get worse if Cex.io will start mining NLG. But, I could be wrong. They caused hashing problems with bitcoin in the past (>51% hash rate), compared to them clevermining is peanuts... do we really want that? Wow... guldenpool at 7GH/s (network is at 9GH/s). Yeah, could be related to that. Anyway, it started working out of itself again. Man, what a clusterf*ck... at least I'm not the only one with issues. Others getting SSL errors when connecting to the guldencoin forum? Funny, bittrex rate shoots over 450 sat and clevermining kicks back in. If you're fine with HCM, you can stay there. I've heard people saying that they are worried about the payout of HCM (finances of the pool appear to be not so good), but I have no hard proof to back that up. Criptoe and Guldenpool are my personal favourites (I like mining where I can give just a NLG address to the miner and have everything receiving at that address). With Criptoe this is a bit difficult. You can see how much NLG comes in to your address that you use when mining (if you use that address for criptoe only). On http://criptoe.com/tbs you can see the pending found blocks, which is the amount of blocks currently found, but which have not matured yet. With your hash rate (compared to the pool hash rate) this can give a bit of indication on how much NLG you can expect.I try to see how much I mined for the BTC that I used for renting and put a sell order (rate = BTC used/NLG yielded) on bittrex. I expect the price to go up at some point, which at that time I will get my BTC back. I would like to suggest people to not add more hashing power to guldenpool, because it approaches the 50%. Criptoe is a nice alternative.Second, I think someone needs to weed out the dead pools on the first page. Exactly the same issue I have with this as well. I started renting hashing power again (~2GH/s now) to combat this. It worked before my "forced" leave, it will work again (check price ramp up from 28 sept to 5 Oct). If more people would do it this, the whole switched mining issue would be non-existent. My last batch of mined NLGs via this way would sell for 630 sat to break even... that is not so much (especially when clevermining isn't dumping so much anymore). Yeah, I know, but I managed yesterday to get the functionality that I needed working (except for the new addresses, but on second thought that isn't really needed for my project). Thank you for your reply. I prefer to avoid calling the shell (the shellshock bug shows nicely why I don't like it), else I would not be asking the question.Past few days I've been going through the code and started writing the python code to interface with Electrum in a programmable way. The problem that I'm running now in to is that the Electrum code is poorly documented and to my opinion made more complex than it should be (Wallet and WalletStore classes to mention one example). Woot! More dedicated hashing power for NLG!
No, I was planning to sell those anyway. I'm putting dedicated miners on NLG and this is what I earned. For this price I play break even with a little bit extra that can go in mining again (and they aren't dumped at the current prise). I have multiple things running at the moment to support NLG. This is one of those things. I don't need to profit on these orders, a solid supported coin (in various ways) is also worth a lot. Seems like we didn't make it... Well, still have my NLG order at 617 sat. Please bring 4.1 BTC (or more) to get that all filled. I'll happily dump more. I don't see selfish millionaires. I see people who stepped in to support NLG when miners were dumping heavy (remember a few months ago when trying to keep the market value above 100 sat was difficult), taking risks because they didn't know if the price would ever go up a lot. They supported NLG when people tried to dump it to zero, this is their reward. I'd rather not have them all dump it out now, because that would push the market price down again a lot. @guldencoin, could you remove poolminers.tk from the first post, it is not alive any more. Looking at the block explorer and difficulty graph I get the impression things are becoming more stable. Or is that just me? No problem, for a test network it would be a fine thing. Just not in a production environment, where mistakes can cost a lot of money. Centrality is the least of your problems then, the security hole (with potential huge losses) would be a bigger problem. And lets say.. you're standing in the store planning to start paying and some update comes in, messes up your wallet (or the device of the shop owner)... people would not be happy with that.Check the antivirus sector... enough examples where they messed up big with their daily auto-updates of virus definitions. Switching pool losing interest? Or do they still jump in and out? This would be too good to be true... I call Hoax. LTEX, were you able to download the pdf? (If this is real.) We'll see at 9th of December... Someone been doing some photoshopping?I hope this is NLG and not the other gulden. Does it do corrections over longer time frames? Hash rate dropped since yesterday... did something change?http://www.guldencointrader.nl/hashrate.phpI've also rented about 220MH and pointed them to guldenpool. The pool has been getting some blocks since then. Not much, but still.Looking at how much was generated, and how much it costed me... I would have to sell them at about 1250 sat to break even. That is not as bad as I would expect, someone with mining gear would do better. Don't worry. Just suggesting a possible problem with the reward drop solution.  Sell pressure on exchanges drops, price shoots up. Switching miners are unimpressed by your efforts (read: they still profit enough to keep doing the things they do). In the past I've used bitcoind on a server to run a web service and used bitcoind to arrange the payments. The problem was that the whole blockchain was too heavy in disc usage. For a different project I have to interface with the bitcoin network again, but bitcoind is out of the question. I'm looking into Electrum instead.Things that I need for my project: - query for a new address.- periodically, check the balance of that address.- sometimes send funds from the server to an other address.I think I can manage do those things with Electrum (been playing a bit with it for now). My question is how to interface with Electrum programmatically. I was thinking to use Python, but can't seem to find what to import and if there is a general class available that allows me to call the methods I need for the 3 things mentioned above.I guess I can import Electrum from Python by using:Code:from Electrum import *Right? And then? How would I continue then?The server has no x/qt/gtk libraries, so everything has not to depend on those. In the early days of bitcoin there was a vivid discussion about a BTC economy, here on the forum. The idea was to have many varying things to be bought by BTC and no need to USD conversion was needed. The problem was spacial distance between the people supporting this idea. With NLG this would be less of a problem. I have thought about starting a discussion about this on the NLG forum, but haven't gotten to it yet.<edit>Started the discussion on the NLG forumhttps://forum.guldencoin.com/index.php?topic=564.0</edit> Settings can be changed (what's in a name), that was what I was hinting on. Maybe other settings would work better with NLG. I agree about price formation, let the market handle it (if it needs to be lower, so be it). About the diff adjustment, I would prefer the tweaking in the diff change algo we set on to this week. If that worked with other coins, it will work with guldencoin. Making forks to the network will only increase the uncertainty about NLG and that will reflect onto the market (that is what we saw yesterday). In the mean time we need to work as hard as possible to get more merchants accepting NLG and continue with its promotion. Fuse, your forgetting the pump en dump schemes that could be included...!!!
This issue also hit the exchanges apparently:mcmont is a Bleutrade admin You got me thinking about this... not sure if it will work. I guess those miners want BTC for their NLG... what if the community pays them a higher rate than the market rate... would that work? Hash rate seems to have dropped a lot. That was the conclusion that I came also to. Started renting hashing power, not sure if that will work in the long run. Thing is, price needs to drop and lower difficulty needs to rise (read: more dedicated miners). This way the switching miner will not be interested in NLG any more. The question is where these limits are? So, what is the break even point (exchange-rate wise) for this switching miner to stop mining NLG? Can anyone do an educated guess on that? Seems like Bleutrade also continued NLG deposit and withdrawal again. Wanted to try out the python api (https://github.com/Dirrot/python-cryptocoincharts-api) today, updated the URL in the library to reflect the new one, but I get an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) error code. Visiting the same URL with my browser results in getting the data, with the python API not.Any thoughts on what could go wrong? Het financiÃ«le plaatje (premine, EFL in omloop, marktvolume etc.) kan me eigenlijk een worst wezen. Hetzelfde met de scamgeschiedenis. Waar wil EFL heen? En binnen welke tijdspan? En hoe gaat dit aangepakt worden? Dat zijn belangrijke vragen, die kan ik nergens terugvinden op de EFL site. Of blijft het maar bij bezoek aan evenementen om te flyeren en nieuwsbrieven rondsturen?Kan het stichtingsbestuur daar antwoorden op geven? Ik ben actief in de NLG gemeenschap, maar af en toe kijk ik even rond op het forum van de buren (EFL). Om eerlijk te zijn, ik zie er niet veel gebeuren. Ik heb niet het idee dat er een ontwikkelaar actief met ontwikkeling van de munt bezig is (wallet software en dingen eromheen) en dat het enige dat gedaan wordt wat promo-acties zijn. Ik betwijfel of die promo-acties ook enig nut hebben aangezien er weinig te laten zien is (en met een beetje graven de scam-geschiedenis naar boven komt). Not if you take the average diff of x blocks and use the deviation from that to calculate a difference from a base maturation time. Just some brainstorming... Is it possible to have a maturation time dependent on the difficulty? So, lower difficulty => longer maturation time for that block. High difficulty => short maturation time. (This could induce some extra fluctuations on the market price though). Personally, I think rejecting otherwise valid blocks is a no-go area. That is not in the benefit of anybody. I don't mind/care the dumping of the coins on exchanges (or the financials of the big jumping pools), what matters is how the pool reacts to this change in respect of difficulty adjustments. If we have a big pool jumping in and out less frequently, this means more blocks for our dedicated miners (and maybe longer stretches of lower difficulty).I've got difficulties trying to visualize the effect of this change on the network difficulty (and your bypass method doesn't make it easier). @/GeertJohan, did you also consider the BTM solution to this problem? Why was it rejected? To me this seemed a very elegant solution to the problem (which should IMHO also be future-proof).Ref: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=554412.msg8870691#msg8870691 Most likely their guldencoind is lagging. And BleuTrade happily follows...Â   ah... ok. How do miners get their funds on bittrex then? How would you know that they aren't in the NLG market yet? The way down would be an ideal situation to start buying slowly, in the process this would slow the crash to stable support levels, something we're seeing at the moment.
Why would said "investors" put money in something that will end up losing value due to their own actions? No sane investor would ever do something like that. KWG seems to be the problem. How about removing/deactivating KWG and making the code more simple?<edit>If completely removing the code isn't an option:While we are calculating both values anyway. Couldn't we make the network to accept the network difficulty in all odd block numbers and the KWG difficulty in the even block numbers?</edit> I think he means a different type of coffee shop.  At other places you can buy mining power for a predefined time. During that time it is all yours. I don't think anyone sees that as a problem. Who is that payment provider? Let's get the quote back that started this:This bottom (market value) is not determined by miners and the bottom is not the break-even point (market value that needs to be for ROI). Two different things, yet you put them in the same sentence... so yeah, I think I completely missed your point. But I know what you mean now.  Marketprice is determined by supply and demand. The quality of the coin (active devs, community, shops accepting it, etc.) determines this. You can invest all your money in some mining equipment to mine some coin, but if nobody wants the coin you can wait for ages to sell them. You can can calculate the marketprice is 1000 BTC (because of your investments), but if nobody will buy it... who are you fooling? In the mean time your equipment breaks down and electricity still has to be paid. Hence you will stop mining because you can't sell the coins (Miner follows the market, the market doesn't follow the miner).Again, miners following the market. You can calculate all the formulas you want, but mining has always followed (and will follow) market price, not the other way around. Bleutrade... to BTC and then to EUR with happycoins... if I would cash out... Currently all the profit of trading goes into trying to stabilize the market. Indeed, but when I look at the bittrex order book, it looks healthier than 2 days ago... and still a lot of buying support. Thank you for calling me a loser. Some people are selling to support the growth of guldencoin. I prefer a healthy market instead of an other volatile pump and dump market. Not sure what you mean, but... they have to be filled first before we see 90 sat again. I have more than 1M NLG open orders down to 90 sat... good luck, boy.  Yeah, noticed that as well. Never try to stop (a strong) upward pressure, just let it flow. Better is to not set up one sell wall, but multiple (even at 1 sat difference should be possible, but is not practical). And switch it to resistance when sold for a support (to prevent it from going down again).When the price goes up the amount of NLG you have left becomes more in value, giving you more power to withstand a further upward pressure. When the price goes down, many small walls prevent a hard crash (the market will need those at some point) and allows you to set higher sell walls again.I was thinking of building a bot that could do this, but yeah.... time. Bleutrade hit 800 and crashed down to sub 500 again. I've put a bit of resistance on 500 that will switch to a support on 450 when it is sold (I keep a margin on 50). The bittrex order book size has hardly grown, which means that the same amount of money is pushing the price up. People are getting greedy, afraid to miss the train. And I'm not sure if the price is completely justified (long time low price in the past) or that a bubble forms (2M chart on bittrex, a small one, but still).The block rewards that halve are still far away and should not be a problem now. Ah... overlooked that.  Of course not (for various reasons), but personally I think people should put their words into action if they say something like this. Else, don't say something like that.[edit]Well, to be honest I have orders at 460 and 470 sat in place atm on bleutrade. So, yeah. I have things on sale.[/edit] Still waiting for those 500 sat guldencoins.... 
Looks like it is. We have more than 400% in 4 weeks... what'd you expect? Pumping to 3000 is easy, but it will crash back just as easy after that. The same problem is downward (on bittrex), 8 BTC until 400 sat, but after that it's a free fall. That's a risk for guldencoin if more merchants start accepting guldencoin (and it has to be put on the market again to convert to euro's).I wouldn't mind if it would stay in the 300 - 400 range for a few more weeks, to give me time to build up some support in that range. I already saw it over a month ago, so not new. If you could pass the comment by Roel to her:http://guldencoinforum.com/index.php/topic,462.msg3368.html#msg3368 Nieuwe plek om je guldencoins uit te geven en de eerste aanmelding via betalenmetguldencoin.nl:http://www.voordekleineprinses.nl/Kinderkleiding voor prinsesjes. How the f*ck do they work? Keep in mind that it is better for Guldencoin if hashes are spread across various pools.On https://docs.guldencoin.com/coin/mining/ you can find all the pools known to us. Apparently I have the same problem, strataghyst. So, you're not alone.  Wouldn't it be better to split it over multiple hosting providers (maybe in different countries)? Seems that harcoreminers is doing ~50%, few other pools a few MH, so should be fine for now. Any worries on the huge amount of double spend attempts? Since I have some bleutrade shares I've been looking into the other coins that are listed on that exchange. No wonder those coins are doing bad. They have NO added value over the fact that you can collect them. This week the following coins were added:* CzechCrownCoin* Darkfox* eUtopium* HoboNickels* KeyCoin* Monacoin* OrbitCoin* SonicScrewdriverI checked the websites/ANN posts of most of them. They list the specs and their fancy name and that's it. No value, info on innovation or niche that it fills, or whatsoever. The funny thing is to read the trollbox, people saying how great an investment *coin is (hoping to pump and dump the coin). These people don't spend money on those coins (get them by trading or so) and people why buy coins, don't buy those. As a result the market "value" drops. I mostly put them on the market for NLG. Please, define "more". At that time, please use one of the smaller mining pools. This way we can track the hash distribution better and react when there is an attack on the network. Large part of the hashing power is not covered by pools. I also saw some attempts to double spend coming by this morning in the guldencoind logs (not sure if they were successful). Everybody watch out with payments!<edit>Talking about these:Code:2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 b1446c2737374e3e19c5fb14d69a23beb64ed9fa6c692588d83133fa19500e40 from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 157a8be2f6f7bcf111bcf656c08a4b3d1b4c86b8c72787ecb85dd10e3c2a086b from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 c403fe1a4e5c6e48fff427d257293302d7d511f96f56bf580ba97c3c2298e59a from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 984ffbfa97faa5e8a414ed35e65297c2ccfcb548537924d5cadf489bd6c1f676 from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 d7471517fb6de207ad50df3dd5c87c45cc33d2db7a99c8989443bfaf49c2649c from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 62f22f52222854a8419645588848f16c2ff4bd931a671517ccdab76781b543f1 from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 d0e374c079c0dbfe7b7c28641310b391b4f51087cc09557f0082ae28453f6c4c from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 2c38c1921ca54787ae24972da75248a3a4e48b127cd27bbdba910108b8708817 from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 52193b387cfc7ad969c2010b5d9c09e51640fcbeb3974ad401327f7cdb977121 from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 a163594efe2c6af0efdddca69dcd82e174f634c7cde390750263035924ac3364 from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 282d8b7939585052876ebbcb13b5473b34ccf640e6aaad60b29f5632c855ff41 from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 02159dff682fa6b1c11608115325be790340e40c39673efc501e6a9b04e0fa9f from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 8b11de0a3b5f80c3ed7ba98e13871a3f0f0ba483e0c77068263d84dcfb61e22d from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 11727d6e8dbbfe6f0ced2f8feb6d22e2932061532b55318d55163927896fcdab from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pool2014-08-05 05:34:58 stored orphan tx 3ef3ed12c361b4bb0f3fb4bed01e884b6441f64ba796243697296d9ea6f3ce32 (mapsz 1)2014-08-05 05:34:58 ERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : inputs already spent2014-08-05 05:34:58 26ff7f836edea420a821b04bf7fa6898fbd939d980bec5f8fe0c3b7781158056 from 85.214.130.36:46296 /GuldenCoin:1.1.6/ was not accepted into the memory pooland a few more...</edit><edit2>This was about 2 hours ago, none since then any more.</edit2> Check the docs for more info: https://docs.guldencoin.com/coin/mining/ The NDA address is the Hardcoreminers pool (the awards in the block chain to the NDA address are the ones that Hardcoreminers reports to have found). That pool is doing 0.7GHs/s atm, with one user doing 0.5GHs/s. Working on a warning/alarm system, but got a bit too little amount of time atm. I started trying out cloud mining (currently adding 60MHs to the network), as a response method to an attack. I also have something else, that feeds back into the guldencoin market. This is not generating much income yet, but I hope it will in the future (no more details on that).So, things are being done, it just takes time. Just send in a pull request to clean this a bit up. Sooo.... I got this 1 NLG... someone willing to pay me 300 euro for it?
That would be great, however, there are currently two people driving this independently.The first person is "Cookie". He is doing this through a donation-funded approach (no free stickers, but cheaper), but ran into issues ordering the stickers. These stickers are relative cheap, but made of paper.The second person is me. I was tired with the delay in ordering of the stickers by "Cookie", so I ordered a bit more expensive (plastic) stickers. These are the ones that are shown above. I paid them myself in advance and offer them for 300 NLG per sticker, but I ordered a smaller amount (which causes also a higher price).So, if you want to donate now I suggest to contact "Cookie" for the address, else maybe wait for the next round to see which stickers are better and will be ordered next, and by who (I would like to see one person dealing with this instead of two).Â  Because most used is the most secure? Ask microsoft if that is true.OpenSSL anyone?The point that GeertJohan wants to make is that security comes at many levels, you have to secure ALL of them. Webservers are very difficult (and expensive) to secure properly. Security is as strong as the weakest link. Riskmanagement comes second, how much is lost when security is breached? That is way more on a centralized server than on an individual wallet. Ah, so I misread that... -addr should be --coinbase-addr, great that it works now. Add -addr=<Adress>, maybe? Thank you, what type of card is that?From the minerd documentation (note this is for bitcoin):To mine to a local Bitcoin testnet instance running on port 18332, authenticating with username "rpcuser" and password "rpcpass":minerd -a sha256d -o http://localhost:18332 -O rpcuser:rpcpass -coinbase -addr=mpXwg4jMtRhuSpVq4xS3HFHmCmWp9NyGKtI'm not sure about the -coinbase and -addr flags, but your username and password could be wrong (not address)?Why not use Guldencoind for solo mining, I guess minerd add overhead? With stock coolers that should be right (My system also gets that hot when running at max), buttake care with hot days. If you're not comfortable with it don't do it, because you won't gain that much extra with it. Or run with less cores (if it is a multi-core system).<edit>Could you give me your card specs, settings that you run cudaminer with and the average hash rate you obtain?It's for the docs.guldencoin.com website.</edit> I don't see why not. Did you try? The wallet software only does CPU mining. You need to let your cudaminer connect with your wallet software (RPC interface) to do solo GPU mining. Your wallet software runs then as a private pool. This is the one you want: http://www.betalenmetguldencoin.nl/index.php?h=13 (includes a map that points to the location). Thank you for mentioning us! We are currently low on advertisers, which make the ad spaces on our platform very cheap. This is also part of the plan and will be implemented gradually over time. The current design is froma time when we were the only advertising platform for bitcoins, so we could afford it then to havea not so nice design. The current idea is to have all the functionality we want implemented first and redesign the site whenwe have all that available.One thing that always makes me uncertain is to how much javascript should be used. Personally I don'tlike javascript that much, because from a security point of view it is a huge risk (for the website visitor). Currently we use a small bit (mainly statistics), should we use more or do people not really care about it? Thank you for your feedback. I've also had a PM with an additional feature request.The initial idea of the service was that advertisers would outbid each other and giving a higher rate for the publisher. The multiple slots should be possible to implement, but will require a rewrite of the bidding, the ad serving and accounting backend system and the frontend website. That will be a lot of work. Fortunately, we're rewriting parts of the site, so this can already be taken into account.PM me when you restore the banner, so I can activate it for you asap. Hello skorek,We hope as soon as possible. We started a domain transfer from Kalyhost (which has the same mother company as MtGox), to ensure our service in the future, last week. The timing that it went through is very unfortunate in respect to our update post. I've tried to contact maplesyrupghost (who is handling the transfer) to get it reachable again, but no response from him yet.BioMike I'm sorry to hear our service is missing features. In what way is your new advertisement network more advanced?We've posted an update about the current things going on at Operation Fabulous today: http://opfab.net/blog/ 'I want to link my Bitcointalk name with BTCJam's. Verification code: 7e384ec0-2749-4ec3-b862-d1093222186b'  Ok, it is somewhat integrated now, including the pie chart code that Kiba wrote (do note that it can take up to 30 seconds to load the data from the database if there is nothing in the cache). Click on the title of the site to go to the site specific part, from there you can get a lot more information about the site and place/edit/delete bids. edd has been in contact with me on that, to see what can be arranged. If you would like to join, contact him.It's part of a new set of pages that allows a new way of bidding on a site and allows the pubishers to direct potential advertisers to more info about advertising on their site. I haven't had the time to integrate it in the site yet, but I'll try to do it this week (no guarantees).I told edd already to maybe contact that person, maybe he wants to join in.  I'm also open for a community sell. Respected people grouping together and run it together (more as a business, then you would have different roles, e.g. server admins, site designers, support desk, people handling "the finances"), maybe issue shares on GLBSE to fund it (I would even buy a few of those). Such group would have my preference.Some of the server aspects:PHP (OO programmed with a clear separation of user facing scripts and backend classes to increase security) Firebird as backend database (not a common choice, but had my reasons for that)PHP and Python running in the backend as daemon for various tasksBitcoind running on the server for pay out with a minimum of the funds.The services are running on a VPS from kalyhost (not everybody might like them, but I never had any problems with them).The OS is Gentoo Linux, using a hardened AMD64 profile, software is up to date.I'm using IPtables to shield off services that should not be exposed to everybody.As you see security was always a main point for me (Operation Fabulous got started at the time when people were hacking into various bitcoin related sites), the community was already facing with sites disappearing and people losing money (and the trust in those sites). The money turn over fluctuates a bit over time. Because I keep most money off-server I normally can do with about 20 BTC on the server for a few days, but I've had times when this would be gone in just 2 days. Counting up the first few rates from https://operationfabulous.com/advertiser/index.php?e=list current pay out would be around 4 BTC/day. I started Operation Fabulous more than a year ago because there were no advertising possibilities and people were asking for it. It was a solution for the community at that time (I had no serious plans to make a profit out of it). While I'm still busy developing it from time to time (and maintaining it, of course), I don't have so much spare time due to my work.I've had offers of people in the past to purchase it from me, but rejected them. Seeing this type of discussion coming back from time to time and knowing that I do not have the time to bring the site up to the level it should be for the current market (and still lacking good alternatives) I think it is time to reconsider to hand over the site to some more dedicated person.I do however need confidence that the person who I will be selling the site to is respected within the bitcoin community, the last thing I want is to have the site and all the work I put into it to fall in the hands of some scammer that wants to get a quick buck out of it. I want some confidence that the site will be in good hands.Psy, was your point about buying Operation Fabulous serious? I see you have quite some posts already, so I guess you've gained some respect in the community. This link was end to me by a friend who did a Bitcoin promotion during the occupy demonstration in Amsterdam last Saturday (look right in the middle):http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2720/Nieuws/photoalbum/detail/2968967/309348/25/Occupy-demonstratie-trekt-dik-1000-man-in-Amsterdam.dhtmlThe site is one of the larger news papers in the Netherlands
Or https://www.operationfabulous.com/See https://www.operationfabulous.com/advertiser/index.php?e=list for a list of sites where you van advertise on (plus their current rate). I hardly browse these forums any more. Best to PM me.Concerning the questions:If you don't get any ads (the amount of advertisers is rather limited), this can have multiple reasons:1) You have a minimum bit.2) You have to few visitors (2000 - 3000 views/day average give a nice rate)3) Skyscraper / buttonÂ  ads are the least used ones. The square and banner are used more often by advertisers.Payouts have been officially reduced to 1 BTC... until the whole situation with MyBitcoin started. I had to stop the automatic payout system.For the time being I do payouts manually, once a week. With that, depending on how many publishers have to be paid out, I use often a 0.5BTC cut off. But it might be different from week to week. Dishwara just take your time buying the shares back (paying dividends might increase the price of the shares, reducing the rate at which he want to buy them back).On the other side, if I'm correct, Dishwara could get his own mining rig very cheap (BTC price is now lower then when he bought the rigs). Hi davout,Are your initial "issues", with the previous release, fixed?Don't want to see Bitcoin-Central going through that again.Cheers,BioMike Electric bill is down by about $110 since last dividends. How come such big difference? (Not that I mind it, just wondering). Dishwara, anything to report? They would have to fire over China... the only country that keeps them in a safe position. And there are some other countries that they would not want to mess with in that direction. Other way to transfer from MtGox:Find someone in the EU who wants to buy your MtGox USD, you transfer the MtGox USD to this person, this person does a SEPA bank transfer to your bank account. So, if I understand correctly, the refund is held until a new purchase is done by someone? BitcoinNotify looks like an usable service. 2 Others:https://walletbit.com (currently writing a PHP class for this one, but requires customer to be signed up with them as well)andhttp://www.bitcoinpayflow.com Are they? How are you so sure about that? I'm looking into a replacement for mybitcoin. I had one question on your service.It seems that you forward payments directly to the bitcoin address provided by merchant, so no e-wallet/account balance.However the part that talks about refunds seems to indicate that there is an e-wallet/account balance.Could you shed some light on how that works? I expect this to be bullshit. Remember the RAM defragers, many people jumped in that also, while it even made no sense from a technical point of view? To me seems a bit more of a problem with the mining ecosystem then the confirmation requirement (half a year ago it would be almost impossible for double spending even if the transaction would show up in your client (0 confirmations)). As far as I know, there is no miner with >50% mining share, so the attacker could not have any grip on that.Still, I can't make up much from their explanation of the bug. The only thing I can come up with is a bug with their SCI sending of bitcoins (not receiving) where bitcoins would be send (and not verified) before the balance in their database would be updated (or that the record update failed). But still, these bitcoin transactions should be somewhere in the block chain and SCI works with a MyBitcoin Account (should have a working email address registered in there). If MyBitcoin wants to come back online and stay in business, they should prevent a bank run. Which is quite likely to happen and would worsen the situation. Sure, it will be harder and should have said something right away, but there are a lot of things he can do. Most people have nothing more to loose, only to gain (even if it is just a small amount of what they had stored). Starting with good communication and updates is just a start. There are some highly trusted members in this community (Bruce for example). If he can get their trust, things will get more easy.Just works here. Did MyBitcoin change the DNS record? Might take time for you to get the update. Wow, best thing for Tom to do now is step in the open (list all used addresses on MyBitcoin, so that things can be traced (if someone sells stolen bitcoins MtGoox/Tradehill or other exchanges might track the thief down)) and start communicating with people, that will give him some credit.Second, he stated once that most of the bitcoins were stored off-site. How can they be gone as well?It is all up to Tom to get his credit back and I think that there are enough people who would be willing to help him with that. If he was a real scammer we wouldn't hear anything from him back.I see a lot of similarities with the MtGox hack, they got out of it stronger. This should be possible for MyBitcoin as well. +1, people who wanted a quick profit and saw that bitcoin is quite risky. You mean... seeing prophesies in the block chain?  *Warning* Don't send now all your bitcoins to MtGox because of what I'm about to say below. *Warning*That was my earlier point with MORE payment providers and E-wallet services instead of less. MtGox seems to have a good safety strategy and they put a lot of effort in it (they won't give up easily, if you see what they've gone through last few months). 
Holding options open.I guess Matthew wants to do something for the community (and maybe lost quite a bit with MyBitcoin) and this is what he came up with, being a bit inexperienced with this type of communities (he said somewhere that he found it chaotic) he does things that are considered inappropriate and his idea being unwanted (community feels attack on its freedom).I guess he is a business guy or manager. Most people here have different ways of thinking (not in a negative way, just different and that causes conflicts).Or, I'm totally wrong. I base my trust on actions, not on talk. Scammers and untrustful services disappear after some time. Trustful ones will stay. After time there will be many more trustful services and merchants then untrustful ones. Bitcoin is still in its infant stage, give it time to build a trustful economy. Also, these failures are good examples for people to learn from. I think we need some discussion about this. Can we come up with some (paid) insurance that pays out when wallets are lost or people are scammed, but not promote scamming of the insurance (proof that someone lost his wallet). Well, with all the ranting on last few days. I also kept thinking on the current situation and your post gives a good start. Here is how I see it.People immediately said that online wallets are evil and should not be trusted. I agree to some extend with that. I used MyBitcoin mainly as a payment processor and needed to keep a small amount on there for my service to work. I can implement a whole payment processor service myself, but it is a hell of a lot of work to do it properly. That is why I used MyBitcoin. As far as I know they were also the only ones that offered such service, so I had to put some trust in them for my service to work. Therefore I think we should have MORE payment processors that offer the same service, but where people can split the risk depending on how much they trust the person running the service. Using an online wallet to store more bitcoins then needed is foolish (I agree with that), but not many people are familiar with encryption (how many joe and jane sixpacks make unencrypted backups at al?). And I think this is something that needs to be tackled. Even a few months ago people were claiming that in a few years nobody would be running the bitcoin client, but use online wallets/banks.But going back to trust, trust needs to be build up and kept. There are quite a few services that have internal wallets/accounting. And when something bad happens (see the Polish exchange) the service provider should give the trust that their customers keep their stored value. Services should have an additional fair fraction of their stored value in a safe spot, so they can take their loss, but keep the service running.In case of the Polish exchange, lets say they lost the 17000 BTC, if they had a safety depot of 6000 BTC they could still operate and generate new profit to counteract their losses. To sum it up, if you set up a service to make a quick profit, also take responsibility for it when you make a mistake and don't put it on your customers shoulders.Online wallets are not bad per se. Most people trust PayPal (I don't, but that's a different discussion), while they aren't even a bank (The MyBitcoin ToS could as well be PayPals ToS). I'm no lawyer, but reading this gives me the following question: if I (in Europe) sell bitcoins (over internet == USA) to some other European person for money... I have to report it to FinCEN?Plus, op topic, FinCEN can't track EVERY transaction, so seems a bit impractical to me. So what prevents people from civil disobedience? I would sell all my bitcoins if I THAT was my teacup... Hope her account isn't infected. This was a 5 minute work. Williams is a quite common name. Now you have a maiden name for some relative (wife/sister?) next step social networking sites and the rest of internet. Searching on the MyBitcoin address gave me the following:Meridian Trust Company LimitedHunkins PlazaMain StreetPO Box 556Charlestown, Nevis, West Indies1-869-469-1333 Tel1-869-469-0968 Faxinfo@meridiantrustnevis.comAnd:Meridian Trust Company Ltd.Mr. Ernie Dover, Managing Director.P.O.

I already mailed Tracey a few days ago, no reply. Maybe someone else want to give it a try? People saw that bitcoin price can go down and lost interest (ZOMG no 400% profit per week!!!! LOLOLOLO)... Price is still more then 1 year ago and I keep buying and with lower price I keep buying more. Bitcoins strength is not in its price, but what you can do with it. Although having mybitcoin getting unavailable caused an inconvenient situation for many merchants. Or something that is run by trusted members the bitcoin community, like GLBSE. Only a "serious bug" (transactions to the bitcoin network didn't get processed) was reported a few hours before it went offline. How? Mailed 3 different email addresses, one (the abuse mail address) bounced. 2 (one of the company registered at that address and one old one that I used in the past to contact them) Haven't replied yet. He spammed al mybitcoin related topics with the same post. People make mistakes... That's Hanlon's razor, not Occam's razor. Seems like I was right. Upgrade went not as planned. Because many people can't? I know enough people who are always in the red figures at the end of the month. Ok, lets hope it is that then. Last thing I want is my bitcoins jumping out of my wallet.dat by themselves.
But did you get any reply, and what was in there? Amen, and doing it properly IS hard! *palmface* That was a joke. Continuously under development (because users want more and better features) and people make errors. And did you contact them about it? Fools, the only way not to loose it is to use a payment processor, like Mybitcoin, to store their funds... oh... wait... Any source where you got the info about the bug? Did anyone remember that advertiser (for VOIP) that they had on the site? Maybe they know more. And which shop owner runs their webshop on their computer at home? Codes their payment processor themselves and keeps an eye on it that it runs 24/7?Store bitcoins as a bank? Sure, do that on your home computer. Run a webshop, then you want a payment provider that does all the accounting for you. That, and I don't want to be bothered with all the details of the accounting. It is easier to get just a notification when the money is in. What could be a compromise is if you send the confirmation when the payment has been seen on the network and actually add the funds to the account of the merchant when there is x blocks containing the payment. From what I know, when the payment has been broadcasted it is already difficult to change/undo it.<edit>MagicalTux, mailed you.</edit> Yeah, MtGox would do for me. Others are no option, because most don't allow automatic sending of payments.I've looked up the whois record of bitcoin. abuse@mybitcoin.com is also down. Googled the address, found this:http://www.nevisfinance.com/Directory.cfm?Idz=1 (same address as under Meridian Trust Company Ltd., with a Tracey Williams-Morton (MyBitcoin owner is registred as Tom Williams), same person?)<edit>Mailed Tracey Williams-Morton with the question if she can bring me in contact with Tom Williams.</edit> Not all e-wallet providers have all the features that mybitcoin has.It is far more easier to have a e-wallet provider interfacing to bitcoind and taking care of all the accounting, instead of doing it all yourself. I've seen already a couple of times that bitcoind died on services. I don't want to have to watch it for 24/7 to make sure it is up. Anybody any idea if this is a more reliable replacement?http://www.bitcoinpayflow.com/ weekend, server crashes, company off for weekend, check back on Monday. Is e-mail btw a legal method to send such letter? Could you claim in court that you never received it? People from the Netherlands have to join a pension fund (done automatically, paid by the boss) and although I don't think it's a bad thing, the people in control (fund managers and government) often do wrong things (risky investments (Iceland, Greece), grabbing money from the funds when there is too much in there due to good financial investments (in the 90s)). I'm 28 years old now and even the baby boomers have to work now longer and get less pension due to the economic crisis, so by the time that I can enjoy my pension I expect to get nothing any more (all finished by the baby boomers who will go with pension in about 7 - 15 years). Economic Left/Right: -7.50Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -3.33 So, around Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. In your reply you make many statements, without providing any references. If you want to convince someone in such strong manner, I would suggest you to add those references (else it seems just a lot like a conspiracy theory in respect to his motivation).<edit>Also don't attack them personally and directly if you have to, you'll loose credit with them.</edit> I have one, only used it 2 times (small amounts) in the past 10 years and paid back at the end of the month. In that way they are ok.
Heard already more jokes about selling isles or the Acropolis to other European countries to repay their debt.About the Greek situation, a lot of European institutions (banks, pension funds, etc.) have been investing a lot of money in Greece due to the high interest rates they offered (anybody with some economical understanding should know that high interest means high risk, red flag). And this bail out is to protect these investors from loosing their money (and to keep the EU voters satisfied the banks throw also a nickel at the problem), not to help the Greece people.Greece had about 75% civil servants (1 person having to pay the salary of 3 governmental workers through tax), previous governments lied about their debts to EU controlling bodies, lots of corruption and no taxes were collected. If I remember correctly the currently interest on their debts are about 60% of the GNP.It would be much better for them (and everybody else) if they just went bankrupt, now it just costs a lot of money to extend the situation. It is even possible to get on the list on your own (without a party). In that way the person gets a list number instead of a party name. Another thing is that after voting often remaining seats are left, which are given to the parties depending on the remaining unfilled votes. Sometimes 2 parties cooperate and link their lists in such way that one of the two parties would get the seat instead of one of the larger parties.This type of election is for the Parliament and Cabinet. For the Senate we choose indirectly through voting for the province council. They often contain parties that are not in the Parliament and can give sometimes interesting situations (the Cabinet needs a majority in the Senate to pass a law or plans). We had the elections for the provinces recently and the Cabinet wasn't able to get a majority with the ruling parties. Despite the fact that they got a vote from a specific party from one of the provinces about a very controversial (for that province) agreement between the Netherlands and Belgium. In the end they also had to make agreements with a very conservative right-winged Christian party to get some things passed through the Senate (where a large part of the country got a WTF? moment). In the Netherlands it depends per party how candidates are placed on the voting lists. Normally everybody who wants can sign up to be on the list for that party, the chair of the fraction is often number one on the list and other current MPs follow, new people are added after that. During voting you vote for a person, normally the first on the list. If the seat is in the vote overflows to the next person. However if someone gets more votes then the person in front of that person he/she gets the seat (even if the party doesn't like it). In that case there are 3 options: the person can keep the seat, the party asks the person to give the seat away and in that case the person can choose to do it or not, or the person decides to become an independent MP (this is also the case if the person is thrown out of the party).After elections the largest party gets the initiative to form a coalition, where the number 1 becomes the Prime Minister and ideally you want to have more then 50% of the seats in the parliament, although that isn't required. Our current Cabinet contains 2 parties, supported by a 3rd. That in most cases give >50% support. Ah, I thought you meant people could only vote for a party, not individual MP. Yes, the largest party delivers the Prime Minister. Thank you for the explanation. The parliamentary system also allows to vote for individuals, but not many people do it. Works voting for other governmental bodies (senate?) work the same as for the president elections?Â  Or is that more direct? The only thing to make people more social is to do social things for them. It is strange that the US socialist party is pretty small if there are so many poor and unemployed people in the US (all potential voters for that party if they would help them directly). I don't think you need a revolution or complete meltdown to get a more social society. Just a change of how people take care for each other.  If they get an economic depression, it's caused by all the "helping" they get. Hard working farmers that managed to get something produced won't be able to sell it then at all any more. People have always been hoarding them. It's nothing new. You call it hoarding, others call it saving.I've been saving a small amount and the rest I spend (normally on donations), but due to the high price I found myself hoarding more then when the bitcoin price was low. Although the price should not matter, so I guess it's something psychological. Wow, I would like to see the financial picture of that in detail. Very interesting.Although I don't think the average US citizen would accept such socialist plan (looking back at the discussion of the health reform plan of Obama). I think the democrats might be able to get enough support from their people to implement such plan, but the republicans would not give them the opportunity to do so. Global? Only the 1st world are affected. Anything outside the Americas, Europe and Australia are doing just fine. Looking at wikipedia it seems the USA has more parties then the two big ones. Why not pick one of those and convince like-minded people to vote for them as well? OP seems to be jobless and is supporting the Republicans... Yes, Americans appear smart if OPs intelligence is below the 90% of the population.Joking aside, to me the US is right-winged or more right-winged. There is no left-winged party in the USA.From my point of view: Republicans always seem to get tax reductions for rich people/companies and spend it to military "toys for big boys". Democrats always seem to have to clean up the mess of the Republicans, being unable to to actually do something useful within the time they get.But don't worry, I see the same here in The Netherlands with the only exception that we haven't had a left-winged government for quite come time. So instead of generating huge debts, our right-winged governments have been breaking down all the social security we have build up in the past and making everything more expensive. 1) Bluff2) If this is so revolutionary. Someone will leak the plans/blueprints. Also, I think that government bodies have to check the device for safety before marketing/selling/renting them, so if blueprints don't leak at the company, they will leak somewhere else. I can recommend to look up his 'Manifest' and have a quick browse through it (1516 pages is too much to read). You'll get the idea why he did it. The worrying part is that people have been helping him to write it (most likely people with the same believes). Heard about this already in April:http://prometheusfusionperfection.com/2011/04/08/focardi-and-rossi/Seems to be confirmed by independent Swedish researchers.The tech might be real, the image looks bogus. Lets see how this turns out. If that's the case, just shut the rig down until difficulty drops again (some people argue that difficulty and price are linked). You're not mining for the electricity company.Maybe see how much you would get if you would sell some of the hardware, you might then even make a profit on that.Example:10 BTC (got from investors) => $300 (exchange rate at high time) => 1 card (used card for mining) => $250 (what you would get when selling again) => 22 BTC (dollars to btc at aprox. current rate).These numbers are just fetched from the air, but I guess you could do some calculations on the data you have. Bitcoin price is dropping, so maybe at some point it might be profitable to just buy some bitcoins to repay for your mining rig. Dishwara, any updates? It's more than you would get for interest at a normal bank account. Nope. Dishwara quit, you should be happy that he buys the shares back.
No problem here, but were you using the same username as on MtGox?Yeah, it sucks. Causes my password manager to not recognize it. Need to lookup the password every time and fill it in manually. I hope they will fix this. Dishwara will keep mining with the rig and the BTC it yields he will buy back shares against 1BTC each or less.In the end he will own all of his shares and the rig is his to keep (unless he isn't generating enough BTC, whichwould make him to sell his rig and divide that under the shareholders and the shares will become worthless, butthis will not completely cover the investments people did). I guess their busy with the MtGox issue (they are the same comapny). Get a newer version of the client, they changed hosts (apparently the client doesn't use DNS) You should not directly mail kalyhost when having problem with your services, but use the web interface from the kalyhost manager.Although things get fixed quickly when you report them, their communication could need some polishing. My point is is that you will be paying 4.5 BTC extra (because the price is then still below 1 BTC/share), while not needed. 4.5 BTC is quite some money (or 4.5 share that you could buy back quicker). Shareholders, here are the amounts of dividends that were paid out to use in your calculations if you go the same route as I:1st dividend on 30 may 2011: each share got 0.02452054 bitcoins2nd dividend on 13 june 2011: each share got 0.02644 bitcoins. I'm all for this solution. I guess everybody should put up their shares for sale against a price that they expect to get for it (more then 1 BTC wont get them sold, but a lower price might get them sold earlier). I guess you also have some BTC in your wallet. I see 20BTC@99999999 ATM, so you might want to start buying those, or wait for my bid which will be lower.I didn't spend my last dividends I got from you, so I'll use them to cover the loss that I get from selling my shares for a lower price. I guess that's fair for both of us (I get the initial invested value of BTC back and you'll get a lower price). We do however need to coordinate this transaction to prevent someone else from buying my shares and reselling them to you for a higher price (then you won't get the benefit of the lower price). Also already start selling hardware that you don't use and buy bitcoins for the money you get for them.Edit:Dishwara, I'll put my shares up for 0.9691280 BTC each (153 shares).@Nefario, can you tell how this should be done? (selling back to dishwara without someone buying them and reselling them to dishwara for more) Dishwara, send you a PM. As far as I know not (I only use the command line client), but ask Nefario. Yes, that's just how security through obscurity works!At least they use mysqli (which increases the chance that they used parametrized SQL).Don't know if there are reported security issues with nginx 0.8.53. Dividends have been paid out recently. Ok, so a better safe then sorry case. As far as I know the account data was leaked through an auditor, so servers weren't rooted. Second, I think kalyhost has many physical servers around the globe, so they don't need to be on the same server as MtGox (I guess the MtGox server was dedicated anyway).Got any link to support those claims? How was the list with accounts stolen? Was this through a SQL injection?How will resetting of passwords be arranged? Last time I checked the source code of them... they didn't use parametrized queries. I hope they do now, if security is so important for them. Aren't you reducing your key space then? Making it less secure. If we can pay with bitcoins  And we had to learn the hard way.I would say drop ALL outstanding orders (buy and sell), no rolling back (just not possible) and let MtGox handle things with the person whose account caused this trouble (instead of handling things with 60000 people).MtGox earned a lot from trading with last 6 months (the 0.65% fee), they should be able to cover most of the costs. Having roll backs would cause law suits, which might even cost more. I wonder how they were able to get it?SQL injection?
Could it be that this is just MtGox profit from the 0.65% fee he charges? And decided to sell it all? Nog niet gespot, maar bedankt voor de tip. Mijn punt blijft echter staan, aangezien als je de kaart behoudt je reisbewegingen nog steeds aan dezelfde kaart gekoppeld worden.Ik reis graag met het OV (al wordt het met die OV chipkaart er niet leuker op). Voor de trein koop ik nog steeds gewoon kaartjes. "Vergeten" uit te checken omdat het goedkoper is, is in mijn ogen nog steeds oplichting. Ik maak gebruik van een dienst, dan wil ik er best voor betalen (fietsen van A'dam naar Maastricht is toch een stuk duurder). If I remember correctly Eligius pays full 8 decimal out. Remains are send after 1 week inactivity. Relax, bitcoin is just a play ball for many of the forum users. We take enjoyment from the rises and falls... The crash was an over-reaction on itself. Saw hints of the price going up already a few hours ago. Bought a few bitcoins just ago. Let the rally begin. With all the hacks that Lulzsec is doing recently.. "hacking" bitcoin might be a good thing. Rather to have them find a flaw then someone who is more black hatted than them. bzip2 should be a more sane replacement for gzip. I think it is mostly the way Bitcoin was introduced on Slashdot (spammy fanboyism slashvertisement) that slashdot people don't like bitcoin. I think the slashdot people would have loved the concept if it wasn't introduced that way and pushed through their throats. There is... in China, but I guess that doesn't count. De OV bedrijven willen ons maar wat graag de OV chipkaart door de strot duwen met alle privacy issues van dien.Nu bieden TLS (het bedrijf achter de OV-chipkaart) ook anonieme kaarten aan... zonder saldo. Om deze op te ladenmoet je deze via je bankpas de kaart opladen.. gevolg, weg anonimiteit!Ik had recentelijk een OV chipkaart nodig (kon geen strippenkaart meer krijgen) en is 2 keer gebruikt (bus tussen Ede en Wageningen).Aangezien ik er voorlopig niets meer aan heb (en eigenlijk ook niet wens te hergebruiken i.v.m. privacy), wil ik dit gebruiken voor een klein experiment.Ik verkoop deze chipkaart (aankoopwaarde EUR 7,50; met waardevermindering bied ik deze aan voor EUR 7,38) met saldo (EUR 6,41) voor 1,5 BTC. Verloopdatum van de kaart is 1-8-2016. Eventueel kan ik het saldo ophogen, natuurlijk tegen een aangepast prijskaartje.Verkoop alleen binnen Nederland, verzending via de post of indien mogelijk langs brengen.Doordat ik hem met saldo verkoop kan de koper ECHT anoniem reizen. So, you pay tax to live there? But for the rest it's free  Seems to be working again. From the site: I don't know if Nefario can provide a "IPO"-site for every IPO they list with most details about that IPO. Now this info is mostly spread over the topic, which might be hard to find back. Could also be used to communicate back with the shareholders. Check back in the thread. There has been 1 payout before. <removed again>Don't think it's that necessary to post it here. Why is this needed? Thank you, reinvested in a few shares  There are only a few advertisers active on Operation Fababulous currently (There are more ad spaces with more views and no minimum bids without bids (read: FREE ADVERTISING!!!)). Highest bid is currently 0.07 BTC/day for Bitcoin Weekly.I guess all I can say is that you should wait a bit more time. Dishwara, thank you for the updates! Hoi Herbert,Op zich wel interesse om je te helpen, maar niet zo gek veel tijd op handen.Wat had je in gedachte voor het uitleggen? Welke opzet?Groeten,BioMike
Yay dividends! Got it and used it to buy a few more shares. Dishwara, how about an update on how things are going? How much have you generated by now? Any more power outages? I saw this coming, a price increase every week? But you will still be able to buy your own shares for 0.75btc/share. That is very unfair to the initial investors. I'll vote "no" again.  Hi, just got notified by SgtSpike about this thread (with the amount of posts per day on the forum and me being busy with OpFab, IRL and other stuff I don't have the time to check them all). Thank you for that.I know that the feature requested here (a bidding preview) is needed and I actually already started working on that as part of something larger, but it is going to take a few more weeks before I hope to release that.Â  I'll try to shift this up on my priority list.Note that I wrote this site in 2,5 months and a minimal working site (no restrictions to ads for a site, ability to change site data, stats, etc.) was released because people were asking for such site (about 5 months ago). I added a new part recently, which required a lot of rewriting and changes to the database. So, more features will be coming, but it will take time. Dishwara is doing a reasonable job with the same type of business (at least he has something up and running). Some info would be nice, especially when things are not up and running yet. While I agree with you, please note that the rig is not so powerful yet. At current difficulty it would take 86 days (p=0.96) to generate a block. In that time the difficulty might go a lot higher then current difficulty. Causing the rig to never generate a block. As long as the rig isn't able to generate a block in 4 or 5 days, I think pooling might be the best option (as in payout vs. no payout). Nobody bids on his ad space. Payouts should be working normally.<edit>Looks like he has an active bid now</edit> @Tawsix,Do you withhold from voting? You do have 51% of the shares, which means you would overrule all the other share holders. Hi Dishwara,Thank you for the update. Very unfortunate that you didn't get the card (please tell that you got the money back and that the seller didn't decide to keep it). Isn't it better to just buy the card in a store (aka pay the money and take the card with you), this is now maybe going to cost more money because you have to wait again (and difficulty will go up soon again).Anyway, could you keep us updated with how much the current rig is generating? Daily or every 2 days... how much BTC you collected and how much this is per share. Also, keep the tech talk (all the contents of each rig, it doesn't say all that much to me) low. Cheers,BioMike Has been like that with previous posts as well... Most don't bother to look how it works and just yell (in a IANAL-type of fashion). With such title on slashdot, I didn't even bothered to read the article... I was quite embarrassed with such title on slashdot. Seemed a bit that someone bought bitcoins just before MtGox went down and wanted to push MtGox back with some cheap publicity. Update:You can now set the path to the keyring to use. The path is the 3rd variable of the MyBitcoin class. I guess it's still on the market: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1617.0 Or have just a distributed computing project (aka seti@home, folding@home, etc.) started that pays bitcoins for the work. Fascinating... what does it do? Indeed, why not use normal SI prefixes? Saves a lot of confusions. Hi Sebastian,Did you already know that you can postÂ  your offer here: https://bitmarket.eu/market/EURCheers,BioMike Personally I think at a point these type of companies will take over the hashing power of pools (call it the next step in mining evolution). If such company manages to get ~6 blocks an hour (or maybe all) it will become very unprofitable for "home"-miners and pools (who mostly depend on the "home"-miners) and they will drop out of mining (unless they do it for the bitcoins themselves, but I doubt that). The question is if such company can get enough leverage to pull such trick. I would suggest to ask in the Mining forum, not here. Where did you get the 150 BTC from?
For all you know they wrote the password down, so they couldn't forget it and the cleaning lady found the note below the keyboard. That would be 180% for you.  My point is that the shares themselves don't loose their value, especially when they pay out (the 50% or 80% will only make the initial investment worth more because of the dividends).<edit>Hey, where did your post go?</edit> Big risk due to lack of trust => big rewards. Bought some shares. I invested in DISHWARA, which is IMHO more risky then this and to be honest I expect more of this. Plus I don't need my bitcoins at this moment, even at 50% return of investment after 8 months would be worth it. Which is a cross post of http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=8167.0 Sure, PM me. Can't do that with MyBitcoin.Also not possible. You just get one if I'm correct.You can query your own account.You can do that from your own account.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MyBitcoin_SCIRage[/quote] What I meant to say, while waiting for stuff to come in, you can already start on the next upgrade to a more powerful system. Would be a waste if the market went down tomorrow, while you could get the $800 for it.I guess the stuff that is currently shipping isn't the full rig that you had in mind initially. Ik heb al eerder posts gemaakt waar iemand een vaste koers geeft, mits goederen ook tegen die koers aangeboden worden. En waar die prijs eens per maand aangepast word. Zo kunnen de hevige fluctuaties opgevangen worden. Of dat via een stichting moet, ben ik niet zeker van. Bought another 100 shares. Dishwara, sell them (about $800 now, should cover your initial requirement by now) and get your rig up and running asap. Doing some mining now myself I experienced how profitable this is. Seeing the amount of cycles spend on distributed computing (foldingathome and alike) I think people would mine without payout if the bitcoins were used in a trusted way that would strengthen the community. Lets say that the bitcoins were kept in one spot and the contributors of the pool were allowed to submit ideas and vote for the ideas.Ideas would of course be how the bitcoins would be spend (with some minor restrictions). >50% (or even >66%) of the votes would execute the idea. Less would invalidate the idea.If you would accept only one idea per contributor per year, they most likely won't send a bogus idea, but only something that has been well thought of.I would join such pool. We trade them for EUR and then EUR to USD.  Ik kan zelf geen groot media-offensief uitvoeren, maar kan wel her en der meehelpen met dingen.Opzetje van wat gedaan kan worden:Media-offensief:- Indymedia (ideetje van Rage)- RTL Z (ideetje van Rage)- POWned (ideetje van Rage)- De Pers/Metro/SpitsShops om bitcoins te accepteren:- Bol.com 2e hands (ideetje van Rage)- Wikipedia donaties- Bits of Freedom donaties, ik heb BoF hier al eens naar gevraagd, ze zouden intern eens bespreken.Overige:- Tweakers.net meuktracker Does this mean you got more shares sold? There is still trading going on at BC? Use the Eligius pool with all the same address for who/what you want to donate to. I was using a CPU miner on work today and sometimes it took about 30 minutes to get a share (I also had 3 minute shares). I was wondering how that would work within the block chain. In the 30 minutes time to complete the share there would already 3 blocks been generated. Would this "share" not be outdated by the time I submitted it back?I understand how normal mining works, but this pooled mining seems to work different. What am I missing? Didn't you get the memo, -1 is the new +1! Might be a bit more difficult to understand to non-native English speakers.How about [BUY] and [SELL]? Thanks, guess I'll be a bit shopping around then. A + for you! Come back when you have the sex head set. 
I set up a pool miner for the first time this morning on the computer of my wife (a gamer, so she a better card then I have). I also chose deepbit.net, because someone else mentioned it to me before. It would be nice to have a good comparison sheet, comparing all the pools besides each other on various points. This went way off-topic. Well, I think there are no good examples of state-run communist systems (maybe the ones that LMGTFY mentioned, but I don't know the details about those examples). Some of the socialist states in South-America (Bolivia) are IMHO better examples of communist states then the old communist states ever were. People from the Americas always refer to the USSR as THE model for communism, which was horrible in its implementation as a communist system. They also don't consider what happened before the red revolutions that led to the development of communist system. You see the same patterns coming back these days (just like the return of fascism in Europe). History is repeating itself. Better for Freeriders (read: bankers)  Yeah, like the current economic model is perfect (US government having to take socialist measures to prevent their economy from collapsing). This one is already around for some time...http://bitpixel.bitcoin.nl/ Communism works if the participants do the work for the community, not for themselves. (think of worker bees in a hive)What you could try is have mining set up, but instead of sharing the bitcoins under the participants, the bitcoins could go to a common goal (promoting bitcoin/bitcoin market stabilization/charity). Freeriders then don't have any incentives to join.

After presenting the form to the user to fill in the amount (or other vars), send the data through the following code:Code:$plaintext_querystring="amount=".$amount."&currency=".$currency."&payee_bcaddr=".$payee_bc_addr."&payee_name=".$payee_name."&note=".$note."&success_url=".$success_url."&cancel_url=".$cancel_url."&baggage=".$baggage;$result=mbc_encryptformdata($plaintext_querystring);$redirect_url="https://www.mybitcoin.com/sci/paypage.php?t=".$result['SCI Encrypted Form Data Token'];header("Location: $redirect_url");You can also get most vars from your own database/cart and fill in the blanks from there. CarrotsYeah. They can. The are Bitcoins arch-nemesis.Ever got hit by one?Rabbits!Never! We will conquer them!Teh rabbits! Finally. Going to send some later today. How much will that generate per hour? I guess less? ssh / vnc / remote desktop... depending on the OS and what you want to achieve. You might want to warn buyers for the dry ice. You can get nasty burn wounds from that when handling without gloves.
Ok, I'll throw a bone (wanted to post this earlier, but thought it would be wise to buy some of these shares first, so I did  ):If you look percent-wise (percent payout against value of the share) the share is not so bad (1% in a week, that is more then what you get in savings accounts at conventional banks). But again, increasing difficulty requires you to compare the USD value of the bitcoins you used to buy the share to the USD value of the payout.Now, lets hope dishwara gets his shares sold and his rig up and running before difficulty rises again. Lets call him "Bobbie". Not quite, only if the share looses 100% of value. The share will keep its value, or might increase or decrease depending on how Dishwara handles his company. Also note that this calculation is based on current difficulty and will drop is difficulty increases ($ price might stay more or less the same, if you do this for getting the BTC it will become less profitable). Depends on how profits are defined. Like I said before I'd rather have a company who keeps some money in store as risk control and for expansion (although for that new shares could be issued) then have a company that goes "bankrupt" because a CPU died. I'm not doubting your credibility, just making sure that this is a sound investment (and not giving you money to work with and find out later that there were better things to invest in).With the 15%, 25%, 60% mentioned earlier this would become:15% -> 0.0789 btc/hÂ Â Â 25% -> 0.1315 btc/h -> 0.000065750 btc/h/share (would give about 0.01BTC/week/share)60% -> 0.3156 btc/hWith the 50/50 option you mentioned:50% -> 0.263 btc/h50% -> 0.263 btc/h -> 0.000131500 btc/h/share (= 0.02BTC/week/share)This is based on the 2000 shares you have issued. Nice specs, but this still doesn't give me a number of how many BTC are expected per hour at current difficulty. As for "monitor/keyboard/mouse", is IMHO not really needed (you could access the system from your current workstation through a network cable), could safe some money on that. Why not a less powerful cpu in stead of more powerfull graphics cards? What OS is it going to run and do you need to buy licenses for that?That is important info to know. That's already a bit better, still not sure though.How many BTC will the rig collect on a daily basis with current difficulty?I also want to suggest the following:Instead of splitting the BTC in 50% and 50% how about the following:15% of BTC for YOU! (call it your salary, if you want more buy some of your own stock)25% of BTC for the share holders (I'd rather have a sound company with shares that have some solid basis + they get a bit more then you, because the took a risk by investing in your plans).60% of BTC stays in the company (pay the electricity bills with it, safe some for depreciation of the hardware and to replace it and to grow the company)Percentages can vary over time, could be voted over by the share holders.As for the buying back, that will become more and more expensive for you (less stocks, price will go up, even more if investors know that you will buy back if things don't turn out). The contract linked to the stock is quite clear in this, when things don't turn up you have to sell all the hardware and give the money from that to the share holders (plus if you have the reserves from the 60% above this will give more confidence to the share holders). I've done a few transactions on bitmarket.eu now, most went fine. Just make sure that you get the info you need to do the transfer, the BIC is one of them (I think you can even lookup the BIC from the IBAN code). I just cancelled a transaction because the buyer didn't respond after about 2 weeks. The transaction wasn't rolled back at that time, I mailed the admins to do it for me. Well, that's why it is an investment. There is always some sort of risk.Having a well sorted out plan is something different. You can make some expectations based on current difficulty, do some research. Code:./bmc.py register........................................................+++.......................................................................................+++Those 2 lines and then it just sits there... how long should I wait?<edit>Now it works.</edit> I guess it is not appreciated. Restored to original. I'm a bit worried about the long term investment:1) What will you do when the next difficulty change comes (payout will be less, can you keep up?).2) When hardware fails, do you have a backup strategy?3) Over time you need to replace hardware to keep up with the speed, how are you going to fund that? Does that go from your own 50% of the bitcoins or the 50% bitcoins that go to the shareholders?If you can't keep up with the generation, the shares will become worthless. No it's not. How would you have been able to post then?  I had the same with Operation Fabulous. Took me a month before I had a proper sleep again. Yes, I was thinking in the same lines this morning (that it would go best through a payment processor).Did just a quick calculation based on products that are offered on various sites.On basis of 11 products I get the following:1 BTC = 1.42EUR or 2.10USDFor some things it is linked to the MtGox market price, for some things I had to guess the price in USD or EUR. But I think this should give an indication. I noticed at the same time that this forum was also unreachable (around 10:00 CET). Looking a bit at how the thread is going, my comments:I never said that I wanted to fix the price (I know that is not wise to do), only stabilize it a bit to get the fluctuations out (the merchants decide what the price is, not what the speculators think it should be. I don't think that the immediate selling is an option, if you sell at a high and the price drops directly after that, you get a loss. Looking at market depth and moving averages might help, but if you did that with the drop on Sunday, you will still make a loss. With a few merchants here. Let me ask the question:Lets say that the current calculated price would be 2.8USD for the whole month (guaranteed sell at that price, only available for merchants). Would you change your prices for goods to reflect that rate (and adjust them every month to the new price)? No requirement to sell them to the party offering at that price if the BTC markets offer more. In the end I think most merchants don't want bitcoins. They want their USD or other fiats. Bitcoin is just a way of payment they want to use, not a goal on itself. If prices for bitcoin rise a lot, they can also fall a lot. This would mean they would have to sell at the same time they get the bitcoins, which might not be possible at that time or the price has dropped within the time of start from purchase by the customer and having the bitcoins sold again on the market by the merchant. For expensive sales this could cause quite a loss for the merchant. With the markets being volatile as hell, it is a nightmare for people actually selling goods.I came up with the following idea, but would like to know how other people think of this.Some merchants already provide goods against a fixed price, some adjust against the markets quickly.My focus is on the ones that provide against the fixed price. One could value their goods in USD and seehow many bitcoins they want for that. From that you can calculate a price per bitcoin. If you would average all these rates (from the different merchants) out, you would IMHO get a more realistic price of how much a bitcoin would be worth.If more and more merchants would stick to that calculated price it would reduce its volatility even more and theexchange markets might move towards that same value.Every month the price would be recalculated depending on the trades that took place during that last month.Is this doable and would this work? I know quite a bit of Muslims, nice and friendly people to work with. My point was:"Shot dead in fire fight by soldiers" vs. "Executed by soldiers"IMHO second one would be a war crime, first one would be not.
* BioMike imagines Gavin stepping into the AMD Head quarters board room saying "I'll buy this place, do you take bitcoins?" They didn't tell in the news here that there was a fire fight. I had a similar idea as how it went with Sadam Hussain, but I guess you can't compare them in that way. Sure it's great they got him, but I'm still wondering how this can be called justice... How I read the news is that he was executed by the US army (together with a few others). Not taken into arrest, have him shipped to the US, given him a fair trail and let him rot in prison if found guilty. If this is true, his rights as a human were taken away and that would make the US not much better than himself. To me Bin Laden got the easy way out and I would not be happy with this type justice. Agree... if I only had a bit more time and knew how to code ruby I would have offered to buy the service over from him. And the ruby coding wouldn't even be such big problem. Time, time, time... The PGP wasn't IMHO not really a big problem (never knew that that was required). The site owner told me he didn't like running it. In the end it took weeks to get reply from him. Your GPU is calculating to get a hit with a specific size of hash. If you get the hit, transactions get incorporated/fixed into the network. You get paid for that. What you're selling is a service (computing power), which costs electricity and hardware for you. Neh, this is just correction. The question is where it stops. $2.5 is a nice bump on the way down, but I wonder if that holds it. $1.6 has been mentioned as one of the supports (together with $3, but we're past that). Or throw it into a hidden network (tor, i2p, etc). Make the client to connect to the server in the hidden network. Question is if US people are going to use it. MtGox also accepts USD bank transfers, so you will have to compete with them (and MtGox being US based they have an advantage in that respect). Ah.. just what I thought. You could however turn it into an organisation that also does lobbying and that kind of stuff. With the shares having a way to submit ideas and votes on proposed actions with all the shareholders. The bank seems interesting, but why should I buy shares for the alliance? Sure, I want bitcoin to succeed, but having 2500 shares within the alliance... what does this arbitrary number mean? Can I vote for things or so? https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=6864.0 Those are investments. If you're pretty sure you can get a good income from them you can use your savings for that (personally I wouldn't use 100% for that, but that depends on the situation and I think you are in a better situation to determine that  ).True, only shacks are expensive here as well. My wife didn't want to live in a shack for another 4 years with me having a good income. We bought a house for the minimal mortgage (20 years with 5.2% interest fixed and subsidy for the first 5 years). This is very conservative mortgage, but I wanted maximum certainty .I'm 28, PhD student, paid back all my student loans and except for the mortgage no debts, 20k on a savings account/in stocks but some of that has to go, because we have to do some restorations on our house. LOL Why? No plans for the future?My parent learned me to save money if I wanted something and never buy stuff that is on loan (for a house is the only exception). In the end you ALWAYS pay more. Also stuff can break, having some money on a savings account allows you to buy a replacement (again without requiring a loan). Mail the admins. Savings account? I guess it was empty anyway. Is there BTW a rule how often bots should poll the API maximum? Miners, who have to pay their electricity bills  Great! How many got crushed in the mail (just curious)? They should take about 2 weeks to germinate under glass.I don't have any web-of-trust, but you can mention me in the honest trades topic.@bitdragon, did you also receive yours?
No bidding, just pay and display. Right? It all causes to increase entropy... we're doomed! My experience with the jsonRPCClient was that it was as buggy as hell. I would look into that (not your code). Looking at the code... it does not do much more then displaying an interface, right? Hi Mahkul,Any hint on when we can expect the "deposit mode" feature? In what stage are you getting that arranged?BioMike Nefario, this however requires thrust in the person issuing the stock/bond/future that they will pay out later and don't run off with the bitcoins. How are you going to handle that? No, stock exchange. Not a currency exchange.Still not sure how it will work though. And it doesn't help is the location is in the UK... you know how the weather can be there. Bump! website copyright says 2009, 2011... I now expect a picture of stevenbucks holding up a dated bitcoin sign in Las Vegas.  I've spend today hacking a python version for the MyBitcoin SCI together.It should work more or less the same as the PHP version.GPG is not optional and uses the GnuPGInterface module. The anonymoustransports (TOR and I2P) are not supported.Readme and downloads on:http://www.operationfabulous.com/mybitcoin-python/Donations can go to 1C7Z6MsaEsjs3No2ZqgNAp2cWgf28rXn6n So, kokjo beat me in releasing a MtGox Python api (working on a MyBitcoin python library atm). Hi Kiba,I think setting up a news paper is HARD (ask established publishers of news papers, I expect them also to run losses on their online content). But at least they can compensate by their pressed papers.The idea of the paper is good, but I think there is a lot of room for improvement. Some points:1) Abstracts with articles. The main page lists the titles and half a line with no clue on what the article is about. Put proper abstracts below the title (full sentences describing what the article is about, check with news papers how they do that.Example: (Article 2) has the abstract "The value of Bitcoin has recently [shot up](http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg60zvztgSzm..." Any idea what the article is about?2) Who are these authors? I see: Vitalik Buterin, Kiba, Nefario, Theodore Minick... who are they? And why should I care to listen to them? What do they know?3) Categories. Make different sections. You have different audiences, some from a technical (IT) background, some from a financial background. Make it easy for them to find what they are looking for/interested in.4) Content. Dare to offer different type of articles... not everything bitcoin related. When I look at the titles I get the impression that I can also read that at the forum. Example: featured article about one of the organisations that accept bitcoin as a donation (write the article about the organisation and mention only in the last line (and introduction) that they accept bitcoins as donation).5) Make people pay, make it less voluntarily. I only see a donation address on the main page. You could offer only part of an article for the first week and have people wait or pay a small fee for the last part. Other idea is to have people pay to have the last part released (when a total of 2 BTC is received at a specific address the rest of the article is opened). The idea is that if people are interested in the article they want to continue reading and will pay for it. But don't do that with all articles.My 2 bitcents,BioMike I need to start selling carrot seeds... so people can grow their own carrots, needs some time to mature though. Nothing new... see that more often with google. (10 o's, click next, only 3 o's left).That's why I use Duck Duck Go these days and only go back to google if I can't find it there (not that often). I think you're looking for a transparent proxy that routes all traffic through tor.I've never set something like that up, but I think squid could do that or maybe even iptables alone would pull the trick. Hmmm, I guess I should have a closer look at OT.First time I looked at it I was a bit hit by its complex appearance (lots of text on the wiki explaining all kinds of things what it could do).Still not sure how OT would work on a day-to-day basis. "Thrust", that's wrong with society. Can you still thrust your bank after the financial crisis?I switched to a sustainable bank when my own bank got in troubles (and had to be bought by the government to prevent a systemic collapse).My new bank communicates back on how they use the money that I give them (savings and investment) and I really appreciate that. I found out that I own a part of a (environmental friendly) building in my village here. And that gives a confident, good feeling every time I walk past it.https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sustainable_banking Sure, but do you get enough time to build up something like that? I think starting with 10000 btc (and $13500 to buy on the bottom side) would not be enough to sustain the lock for even a few days.
As soon as the market would move into one direction (many buying or many selling) the "lock" would overflow and the market would break out of the "lock". The only thing it would do is delay a upward or downward trend. I'm a happy user of the perspectives system, works like a charm, although I think there should be many more notaries. That could be caused by bitcoin:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1004.0 Sure, PM me your address and I'll give you a bitcoin address. They will be send today (although it will take some time to arrive, because of the Easter holiday).[edit]Please not that I wrote ~1 gram, the balance I use is not really accurate, but you should get enough coriander from these seeds to cook with.[/edit] Yes, 3 BTC for about 1 gram (~100 seeds)Ok, lets see how this goes. I have a few grams of Coriander (Coriandrum sativum) seeds left from last years harvest. I've germinated a bit from this batch and the plants are already growing on my balcony. Having a few grams left I decided to offer them for sale.I send about 1 gram of seeds through mail (I'll put them in a padded envelope, but I can't give a guarantee that they will arrive undamaged).Costs 3BTC for the seeds + postage costs (depending on where they have to go, but at current price max. 2BTC).Seeds are send from The Netherlands. If I've lived in the USA I would have bought some. My experience is that you can get some decent speed with tor these times. Install a tor proxy, connect with MtGox through https with that. Should be safe. Makes me think if these bearer bonds that you see on biddingpond are going to fill this niche. Or have USD to drop in value People who sold early. Long term outlook is $2 to $2.3, you can still buy. Or wait until people notice they can't do anything (except buying , now expensive, socks) with it at the moment and start selling it.I wonder how much this rise damages the trade from merchants (people will most likely wait until they adjusted their prices). Wasn't there code to hook off old clients from the network? I guess you'll find more info in the logs. Sunday and Monday, but today (Good Friday) is also a bank holiday for many. My bank handles the following criteria for the free euro transactions (these are the EC criteria):- Transactions in EUR- Max. 50 000 EUR transaction- Within EURO zone +Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein Well, actually yes. It does. If you get a hit to a difficult challenge, you get the bitcoins.The network doesn't want more or less then 6 blocks an hour, so it balances the difficulty to get that. Wonder if it could be implemented as a "theme"... Then you don't need a fork. Sure, but that does not make him a hero. He didn't have to step forward with it, just send it back to the faucet. To me it now looks like some attempt to boost his personality within the community (aka, "Hey, look me. I did a misstep, but going to fix it. Now I'm cool, right?"). My post was more to let him think of the consequences of doing such things and that he learns from it (hope that it prevents him to do it some place or to someone else again). We've seen numerous cases of people not being honest and I think that most would not think about consequences. With that post I hope more people (those who didn't step forward) will think of what they did and send the btc back to the faucet.To me someone who has a real shame should not be bragging about it (hence the word "shame"), but should just put everything in fixing what they did. Why do you need a poll? Can't think for yourself (or no morality)?You should pay back the 40BTC you got by abusing good intentions of people. People donated to the faucet to help bitcoin grow by showing how it works. By your actions you counteracted that, causing people that might be interested not being able to look further into how it works.Due to your abusing Gavin has to invest time and put up barriers to prevent your type of abuse.So, shame on you. Pay back the 40BTC (I think everybody should send back what they got from it) and if you can spare some extra send it also that way. I'm working on a python lib that (hopefully) will provide an uniform interface to the major exchanges.Currently only MtGox (mostly untested) is in there. I started coding it on last Sunday.One other issue I see is that money might accumulate at one exchange, while needed on an other one.Might take a week to get it from one exchange to another.
Or a bot that buys on one exchange and sells on the other one... making a profit in the process. Wow... people must be really wanting those Alpaca socks... # ps|grep bitcoindThat is how I normally do a quick check if services are running. I'm building a similar lib in python (hope to release that soon), but I have a question about placing an order and seeing if it got filled when I have multiple orders in my order list. Do I need to iterate through the whole list to see which orders got filled and which didn't?Wouldn't it be more nice to have a transaction history with timestamps? I'm a PhD student. I'm not restricted to exam times.  How good is your biochemistry? Can I for example ask you about different types of protein modifications? (the chemistry behind them) Ah, this might prove useful some time. BM.eu freezes the bought bitcoins. If there are problems you can contact the BM.eu admins, they will ask for proof of the payment and resolve the problem. My experience so far is that many sellers immediately release the coins (could be due to accident) or after you told them you paid (not what I would do). If you can't agree about transaction of the euros both parties can contact the BM.eu admins to undo the transaction (bitcoins go back to seller and you don't have to pay any more).Read a few post back. BM.eu is sorting everything out with legal council, but it takes time. They just want to be sure they will not be shut down by authorities. Please write proper English, I'm not a native speaker and the language above is difficult for me to read and understand without reading it 2 times.Writing down keys to coins in IMHO not doable. The best thing you can do is put them in an escrow or send them to a mybitcoin account and take the login data with you on the paper. That would be very nice. I think it is a bit silly to do international bank transfers for a few euro cents, just because someone sells 1btc. If I have to do 50 transactions for 1btc... that's a lot of work... Or, instead of a 10btc, a limit on the total amount in euros (5 euro minimum?). Yeah.. it really twists your brain in the same fashion if you try to comprehend how the ying/yang is going.Back on topic. Did you already send the rules upstream?If you don't want to add exceptions every time for a self-signed certificates I suggest to use the Perspectives plugin. Very nice article. Neh, memes need to be a bit funny/silly/cheesy... the things you mention are not. I have a couple of reasons:1) Pay for my VPS from kalyhost.2) Buy bitcoins for people within my country who don't want to trade on an exchange. (bit of speculation in here, but not much)3) Donate to projects/people who do something I value highly. Yes.I think that should work without any problems. The devs might be more sure about this.Well, it's just a name, so I guess so. The files you want to save are in your profile or home directory.You might want to upgrade, there is a bitcoin-0.3.20 already out.wallet.dat contains all the cryptographic keys to your coins. That file is what you want to keep.Transactions are not in that file and can be redownloaded through the network.Implementations can differ between stores, but it will go something like this:1) Go to shop, select product and go to a checkout site.2) You will be presented a bitcoin address.3) You transfer the required amount to that address (from within your client).4) Transaction completed and your product will be shipped. Talked to MagicalTux and one of their systems had issues. I don't know the status about that atm, but downtime should be reduced when the system goes down again (lets hope it doesn't). Advertisers have been compensated for their lost credit.And now for the good news:I've pushed a new interface to the users with new features. Although it should work fine, if you experience problems, please let me know.Some new things:General: Ads can be marked as animated or X-rated by the Advertisers (and if they don't do that I will, but that can take time). Site owners can indicate if they allow these types of ads and websites can have a default policy (reject not-yet-approved ads or allow them).Publishers: New website interface (with stats, approval of ads, ability to change settings, etc.)Advertisers: Warning when you try to bid on a site that you have no compatible ads for. New website selection screen for placing a new bid.This was a pretty invasive update for the code base and server, so that is why it took so long. I can now focus on more smaller updates for features and suggestions that people have send me. Nice, I guess it will be US only? Could you provide a scan for us non-USies Meh, most leaders have blood on their hands... I guess it comes with the job. +1, especially within the field of CS things go fast and get replaced by better things (even if it is derived from bitcoin).They are, just not in the field of CS/financial. These geniuses fill up a niche that nobody thinks of filling up, plus they need an open mentality to share their thoughts (most don't, can't or are considered crazy). Wasn't there a post of someone wanting to buy like 100000 BTC and was redirected to MtGox?That would explain this. Seems that for some reason the system could not be accessed any more (Kalyhost fixed it after mailing them when I noticed it this morning), could not even reboot the system from the control panel. Revenues for publishers seem to be unaffected (logs showed that accounting was still going on while being unreachable). Advertisers will be compensated later this week (after I looked at what went wrong). There goes the income from last 3 monthsÂ  .
Yes, got it! Davout, maybe discuss the future of BC in a new thread (during our email "discussion"). I think it is good doing this. When can we expect this feature? Also with view on 1BTC transactions (people now just confirm then, yay! free BTC). * BioMike doet aan pre-paid... en houdt altijd een hoop over. Update for today.People who want to make use of the escrow, PM me for an address. I'll generate an unique address for every person to keep track of who paid what.Currently in the escrow:- BioMike: 50BTC- noagendamarket: 10BTC Ok, send the 20BTC to you donation address.Â  One more question. For the international transfers, are only the SEPA countries matched? Or will there also be a match if someone in outside SEPA zone and someone in SEPA zone check it (I guess then there will be additional costs to it). People who want to make use of the escrow, PM me for an address. I'll generate an unique address for every person to keep track of who paid what.Currently in the escrow:- BioMike: 50BTC Using SEPA is a bit overkill to transfer 50 eurocents.But the problem that Mahkul describes is the thing that is holding me back from using the market more often. If he could update my account on bitcoin-central or even send me an email... that would be nice... Ook handig als je je beltegoed niet op krijgt (heb ik nog wel eens last van). Ah, GET en DONATE hebben dus dezelfde functie. Yay! I really hope that he is just busy IRL (but then again, a small post saying that would be nice). I have a client running on my server, but no coins in there. I'll make a new address for this tomorrow and post it here as an escrow account.Unless someone objects... Hey, eindelijk eens een service voor Nederland.  Ik snap het principe alleen niet helemaal.Stel ik doe "GET BITCOIN PURPLEZKY", krijg ik dan bitcoins van jou? (Van de FAUCET kan ik wel begrijpen, maar het andere lijkt toch niet te kunnen) En waar gaan ze heen, in geval van de FAUCET? Nope, still nothing heard from Davout. Ok, I pledge 50BTC (want a map named BioMike  ).BTW, is there still someone as an escrow needed? I want to help, but still have some questions.1) In what programming language will it be coded? 1a) What libraries will be used?1b) Will I be able to run it on a Linux system?2) Will it be open sourced or not? (Not a requirement for me to donate, but still good to know).3) What are your plans after releasing the game? Support and more games?4) When do you consider it to be finished (and have the funding being paid out)? yeah, functionality is quite restricted. Would be nice to have some update on the status of that site. http://tradebitcoin.com/ Great idea! I'll donate 20 BTC when that gets implemented.Yes, that would sometimes be handy. As long as that stays optional.
Thank you, much better. Still wondering about the following:Lets say I won to buy some bitcoins. The person offering wants to be paid through Paypal, but I only want to pay through bank. How would this resolve? Will his bitcoins stay frozen until I pay (which I won't because he only accepts paypal)? And I want to place an order again at the same price (which will be matched again with this same seller), but can't. Why do cancelled transactions end up in "Your fulfilled offers"? Doesn't seem logical. Yeah, noticed it already! Great job! Going certainly to make use of it.[edit]Just to confirm, EURO withdrawal has still a 2% fee, right?[/edit] RedWall Stock Exchange (RWSE)(RedWall comes from its Chinese origin. Chinese wall with red from the (Chinese) socialist colour, the colour of luck or the Chinese flag (you choose  )) Yay, seems more as a system to replace bitcoin-otc then an actual exchange (the way you describe it). I'm going to give this a try.[edit]How can I see the payment method in transactions? I'm only interested in EURO (IBAN/BIC) bank transfers.[/edit][edit2]There seems to be some sort of Flash thingie (no idea what it does) blocking my deposit address.[/edit2] Yeah, I've transferred also a multiple times. At those times it was fast. Not having time to add it to the account is not so much of a problem, but 3 weeks no time? or even time to reply with a date when it will be added. Waiting now almost 3 weeks to have my funds added to my account. Totally not acceptable. In many places banks are responsible for your money, and they want that your money is safe and can only be transferred by you. That's why they have to validate that you is you. With bitcoin on the other hand, you are responsible for the bitcoins.Besides that, card readers (doesn't really need to be USB, or actually a CARD reader) are the most secure implementations I've seen yet (I've seen a lot of unsecure "security" measures as well). Trust needs to grow. Someone who has a good reputation on the forum is more likely to be trusted, then someone who is just joined the market. But still, don't keep to much money on the exchange. Even someone trustworthy can become less reliable and the exchanges here are not registered financial institutions (no protection if an exchange just stops and the owner disappears). Sorry, I don't have bticoins. I think you can offer expertise in that area (maybe writing for the bitcoin weekly http://bitcoinweekly.com/ )? Now, get a barcode tattoo on the back.  Well, at least it doesn't look like an April 1st joke. Domain != website... just remove it and keep your email records. Saves you hosting costs for the web space. Bitcoin withdrawal is also broken.Â   Trade is quite limited on bitcoin-central at the moment. I want to do some trading there, but I'm waiting for more than 1 a week now to have the funds added to my account... and this all while the selling price of bitcoins is dropping. Have you been able to get into contact with him? I already send him a mail more then a week ago, still no reply from him. Davout seems to be busy IRL these days. Lets hope he comes online one of these days. I'm trying to make contact with him also. They already accept bitcoin as donation.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Donation-accepting_organizations_and_projectsAnd yes, I enjoyed watching the first 2 episodes. This offer is still open. Chinese students with some ebuild scripting abilities could work together with me on this.PM me first before starting on this. I'd rather have not the Gentoo bugzilla overcrowded with Chinese students .Depending on the level that the student(s) can contribute, I might lower the bounty. (The 30BTC is only if thestudent can provide a fully working, tested ebuild without any help from my side).
Looking at the last few posts (and my communication with outing), I get the idea that the level of English of our Chinese friends is improving.Or is that just me? I can't agree more. Also about the tests. A good test tests if the student understood the theory, not remembering specifics (split grammar and vocabulary and test them separate). E.g. gives them some simple sentences and let them modify them to the different tenses (past, present, future and with continuous and non-continuous). There is no way a student can specifically study for that, because they don't know what sentences they will get during the exam. Hi outing,Those are nice, but not what I asked for. If you can give this level of quality I will be happy, but I think there is some miscommunication here:I want your company to MAKE to movie (get some seeds, sow them, do the recording, edit the movie and send me the result).NOT to send me a movie of the same thing other people did. I can find those things on the internet myself.I know these things take time to do properly, but that's why I will pay you for this.Please reply on the questions that I send you yesterday in the PM.Cheers,BioMike You're funny. I send you another PM. Have a good rest and a good school day tomorrow. There have been attempts in the past to do something with Tahoe-LAFS, but never got from the ground (to difficult for people to implement and the system seems to hang when one share goes off-line). This was half year ago, maybe things have improved by now. Nefario,I think it would be wise to guide them a bit more before unleashing them onto the forum. I think that is where this lacked. Also have them focus on one thing and have them do that properly. I still hope to get my time-lapse video of a germinating seed. I had some other good ideas for them, but nobody offered anything related close enough to ask for it (the time lapse was because someone offered a stop-motion video, which is quite related in the way to make it).I guess not only the students learned a lot from this (you should reflect with them in class, what went right, what went wrong), but also you as a teacher should have learned a lot from this. I send you a PM (top of the page, "My messages") with a bit more details on the info I would like to have from you, see if we can get a deal. I was not talking about the paper-cut part, but more on the stop-motion part. If you can do that, you can also do time lapse recordings.Which is what I'm interested in. I would like to have a few video's that track the germination processes of seeds from (Chinese?) plants over 3 days after germination. Your company needs to make a set up for this (during the night the light needs to go on for a short time to make the next picture), do the recording (1 hour interval, should be automated) and post process editing (make a movie out of it and put some music in it).Here is an example of what I'm talking about:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPTJ3qD1ikk If that was the case, why would people not move to other exchanges then?MtGox just runs fine and people are still trading there. And looking at the chart from last week, I don't see a heavy crash since theproblems in Japan started. What I do see is that not so many people are buying and a LOT of people are selling. I guess many buyersjust don't value bitcoin at $1. Sheee... I wonder why the price is not $1 any more... and still dropping. Is this the same thing as how the initial South Park cartoons were made?If the company does stop-motion (å®æ ¼åç«) kind of recordings themselves (and not rip stoff from the internet), I might be interested in letting them do some work. If they do it properly (read: good quality) then they might make enough to pass their course. Outing, contact me (by PM) if you are interested in doing this work for me to discuss my work and a price. Not every person can do everything. If they would try it would be very inefficient and it would only cost the company money. It is far better to decide a direction that the company follows (a core business stated in the business plan) and hires qualified people needed to do the work properly. Second, in most markets people look for companies that can fill their wishes and needs. If a company says they do everything, I would not trust them being able to fill the needs. I expect a bakery to have more knowledge about bread than the local bike shop. To bad, I'm on a conference myself that day. I think that the goal of the course is to learn the students to interact with "western" people, not to do something with Bitcoin (although they should be able to find out for themselves that there are possibilities for that also and they would be better able to judge what is possible in China and what is not). @Nefario, some feedback for next time:Have them make a business plan in advance, so that they know what they will be selling/doing to make money. Now, they are mostly asking the market to come up with ideas ofÂ  what their business should be. In the big "western" world this would look stupid and they would fail. Second, because the market/people are different in their mind set, let them do some background research about "western" people. Even people from the US, Canada and Europe have differences in the way how they do business. Part of their business plan would be to make a website and have it hosted (and let them know that they could use some of their initial capital to rent web space).Having ~18 people per company (which imho is a lot for a starting company) they should be able to do a lot more than what I see now happening (even having each student spending 1 hour a week, should generate 18 man hours of work). Ah, missed that (never look in off-topic). Nefario,Would have been niceÂ  if you'd warn us before.How many students did you send to here btw? Are they all Chinese medicine students, or are some that have other qualities (coding, art)? MyBitcoin seems to be getting worse at doing their service... I guess we're going to need a new/better merchant/payment service. Yay nog iemand !!! With all the posts from Chinese students... this one is actually GOOD!I don't know that much info about traditional Chinese medicine, nor am I ill that often (well, got a bad cough at the moment).I am however sometimes interested in health promoting properties of plants (I think that's also part of Chinese medicine, right).Do you have something to offer in that respect? (I'm doing a PhD in plant hormones). He might be restricted online due to the power quotas.
Didn't MtGox have a similar service? epic disaster can strike everywhere... Plus I think Kalyhost has their servers spread around the globe. Als iemand vanaf Bitcoin-central wil cashen... Ik koop 50 BCEUR voor 50 EUR via bankoverschrijving. Dan hoef je hopelijk minder lang te wachten dan een internationale overschrijving.Ik heb mijn diensten een beetje uitgebreid/aangepast. Zie mijn signature. Couldn't that be hooked up to the bitcoin-otc trust db? As long as merchants keep accepting it, it should be fine. One thing is that Europe and/or Asia need to catch up on the market. The market is highly US centric, people from Europe/Asia are limited with trade in that respect (due to distance/trust and US only shipments). Ok, no reply from t3h any more.Whoever wants, feel free to take this job. Rules still apply. And while doing that, include a copy of "1984".Â  Back on topic. When someone sends the peanut oil or the butt plug, the name of the sending company will be most likely on the package. If I would get a package delivered from "ACME Peanut processing" and I would be allergic... I would not accept it (I didn't order it anyway). Same goes for the politician. Plus I think politicians don't accept packages themselves.. and they would go through an x-ray or so before opening them. Hi,Welcome on the forum. Although I'm not interested in buying these coins, I've seen people selling coins coming by from time to time.This raises a question for me. Why do people buy them? Is it for the gold/silver? Is it for collecting? Can you actually use them to buy stuff?Good luck. You might also want to check out biddingpond as a trading platform.Cheers,BioMike I guess rumour. I think the server just broke and Davout might be busy IRL (Winter holiday/Carnaval?). However, I've posted a message in the French park meeting topic, see if someone there has seen him. Hi,Sorry, not a French speaking person here, but I guessed this is the topic for the park meeting.Davout seems to have disappeared. Did someone see or speak him recently? Was he at the park meeting (was that yesterday)?Cheers,BioMike or bitcoin-otc Cheap new gaming rig Just joking. I wonder if Davout needs some kind of help. E.g. server maintenance, finances for payout (little cache for payout), etc. Or ask Davout to add GBP to the currencies of Bitcoin-Central. I think he even lives in the UK. I hope to fix that with the upcoming big update (hopefully within a few weeks). The text above the site selection screen (part one of creating a bid) says the same (but I guess people don't read that). To solve the timing problem, the amount should be split into various (random?) amounts and then send at different time points. There could be a few same entries of the same value in the database (created when Alice adds her bitcoins for Bob) that are send at the same time to different addresses (owned by the laundry, but nobody knows that)). In the end the laundry sends money to the receivers and to itself. I wonder if it would be possible to put the "credit" in an other chain. One that doesn't allow any other miners then the people handing them out (and doing the whole validation of transactions), but with the normal cap that the genesis chain has and allowing people to check the chain. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MyBitcoin_SCIThe GPG stuff isn't covered in there. It comes down the fact that you add the MBC key to the public keyring of the process that php uses. Then it should just work(TM). You can also instruct GPG to look at a specific place for the public key ring. <cheesy>Or over 30 cm... 30 is more... more is better.</cheesy>
Why not use bitcoin-central? I think the $1 value was just a rally because many people from the USA wanted to have it at $1. I don't know about Mullvad, but I know from Kalyhost that they adjust the price of their services when the price for a bitcoin changes, to reflect other currencies. So, if price goes up you pay less btc.One thing you could do is split the amount it costs for your services over time. (So 60btc vps for 6 months means buy 10btc per month). Sometimes you will pay more, sometimes you pay less and if there aren't that large fluctuations, you should be fine. WOW! Someone sold a shitload of btc on BC! LRUSD and LREUR are down to 0.1 and 0.02. Thank you for that. Freshmeat.net release submitted. Slashdot effect (article about the $1 parity).Drop is IMHO a correction to the artificial run to get the parity. Just curious, how many wires per week and for what amount are we talking about? I've been looking at the EUR order book for the past week, not much is going on. Some people explained the 50k on slashdot. It isn't a hard requirement to start the foundation, but a common practice to have some starting capital (and to give some trust to the people who you're going to cooperate with). IMHO 50K isn't that much (you can maybe have only 2 persons working full time for the foundation with that money), as long as they spend it well.Also note that LO was once Star Office, which was made in Germany. I wouldn't be surprised if there are still people from the original company involved in the development of the code. I know, although I'm not sure the xorg-x11 is the solution. Ebuild has multiple problems. t3h, could you give an update on this? Update:I've added a simple blacklist to the site. When you remove a bid, it will be automatically banned from being able to bid with that ad on that site again. This is only a temporal solution, until I get a more advanced approval system up and running. There should be a button "remove" beside the ad in the list, from the website detail. Click that and it should be removed (advertiser could however place it back, still working on the code to make this impossible). Great to know you got it. Happy spending of it. Get a second "branch" (new genesis block) of bitcoins. EUcoins, USAcoins, Chinacoins, etc.  Adblock looks for common used words on parts of sites and if it contains things like "ads" or "advertisement" it blocks it by default.There is nothing I can do about that. Project Wonderful must have the same problems with this (they warn about it when entering their site, I might get something similar in place later, although many people who use ad blockers also have noscript (javascript is used to detect if the user is running adblock) and then it doesn't work any more.Yes, about 10 - 15 sites (most of them getting 10-40 views per day), and only about 4 active advertisers.1 site manages to get ~2200 views/day (in the weekends a bit less), current advertiser pays 0.26btc/day to have their ad displayed.I've been tracking income over the past 2 weeks, there were no payouts (5% fee, based on 5 btc this is 0.25btc/payout), this gave about 0.15btc/week. The ad on the front page of the site has generated about 3 btc until now. It's not much, but I'm happy with the results so far.BTW, I see that someone tried to do an SQL injection... which failed.  Your site is activated now. About the ads in the ads list, disable any ad blockers. I didn't see anything unusual in the logs or database, so my guess is it is that.True, I see people slowly dropping the minimum bid to 0. So, the best way then is to overflow the order book with buy orders for all prices and delete them when one has a hit?Â   Liberty Reserve (some other form of e-cash). Hi tuxsoul,Sign in into your account, go to "Websites" and click on the website of your blog. Then click "website code". This gives the javascript code to load the ads. When everything works you'll see a placeholder image (like currently on this site: http://dylanw.dyndns.tv:8331/lvbx/ (Note the small orange section)) until it is approved by me. Then people can start bidding on the ad for your blog.When testing please make sure that you've disabled any ad blocker, else you won't see anything. I think the best way to help is participating (especially advertisers). There are quite some sites now (most have now reasonable minimum bids), but the amount of active advertisers could be a bit higher. If you want to help, but you don't have anything to advertise, take a foss project that you like (hint: bitcoin, there have been ad runs for that before) and place an ad about that.If that's to much "work". I could open an address where people can donate to, to advertise bitcoin, or something else. In that case you could also help with providing nice graphics for ads.<edit>Donations can be send to: 13udpXVNV1R2uSBAvpnUosJ1NLxGgmN57WI will use those btc partially to promote Bitcoin on non-Bitcoin centric sites and partially for the rent of the server (although with current bitcoin price we're covered until the next year, so most will go to promoting Bitcoin).</edit>@Quip, I'll activate your ad later today (have to go to work first). Also, a good way to help is get a lot of visitors. Do you use the pgp/gpg interface, did you try to turn it off?Do you see anything in your web server logs (that MBC calls the receipt script)?
yeah, it corrected immediately after. Ah. Thank you. I just did a right click->save when I saw the URL that it links to. I found the S01E01 torrent on VODO site (I guess this is the pilot), but it mentions also a second episode, where could I find that? I've put down a buy order yesterday of 0.60 euro/btc. Now I see on the chart that it recently went down to 0.45 euro/btc, so I expected that my order was handled, but after logging in I see that my order is still there.Bug? Is your receipt script reachable (firewall/NAT)?Did you setup the merchant data in your MBC account? Welcome, more hosters, the better. I think however that this belongs in the Marketplace section.I've been using the services from Kalyhost for some time now. They do a daily calculation on the average value of bitcoin of the day before and then determine the price based on the amount of $ or euro (don't know exactly what currency they use) their services cost. @t3h,Are you still working on this? Had a quick check with installing. There are a few issues while emerging (one that I posted on bugzilla and some error messages), also not all fonts show up when I checked in Inkscape. I remember that some fonts have different formats. Might be caused because of that. I had a quick look and it looks ok (haven't checked through install, will do that later). Could you put it in a file and add it as an attachment?Also, could you set all keywords to ~arch?When all is ok, I'll PM you for the btc address to send the bitcoins to.[edit]I'll check tomorrow. Getting late here now.[/edit] Yes, I can't agree more. Now they don't make anything, else they would maybe make a few cents a day. Not much, but still more then nothing. Also check the location of the ad within the site. Putting it completely at the bottom will also generate less. I'll put a "hint" on the site later today.People can always PM me if they want to have something changed, that will also be easier then re-setting up the site (which also needs to go through approval).There are now about 8 to 10 advertisers registered, but only 3 or 4 have bids running. I wonder why the other advertisers don't bid. Those things are part of the 1.2 interface (page does still reflect the 1.1 interface).SCI Payer is determined by MyBitcoin (depending on how the person pays).SCI Transaction Number is also determined by Â Bitcoin (it is the number of the financial transaction).If you need your own numbers/data included encode them in the baggage field. I've posted this bug on the Gentoo bugzilla a week ago:https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=352539It is to request an ebuild (or better, multiple ebuilds) for the fonts of the website:http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/I'm offering 30 btc to the first person to provide an ebuild to install these fonts on my Gentoo system and follows the rules below:- Fonts are functional from within most programs (Inkscape/GIMP/Openoffice/etc.)- Ebuild should follow Gentoo QA guide lines as good as possible (I'll give feedback, if needed, you need to fix it then).- Ebuild has to be uploaded to the Gentoo bugzilla, comment with your btc address to send the bitcoins to (when I'm satisfied with the result). I have this when no bid is placed on an ad space (see http://bitcoinreport.blogspot.com/ and http://www.infinitypfm.org/ as an example).I might want to add a link later, but it is not a priority atm (need to make the bid page public available for that as well). "stats are available for advertisers", not publishers. The publisher website detail page needs a redesign to make some room to put it in.If you want I can PM the current stats to you. There are 2 checks for the size. One within the HTML code, that the browser should respect (most of them do) and one server-side.The server side I could implement that way, but the HTML one not (I don't know what type of ad someone is going to upload before they do). Or everything would have to be spread over multiple pages (like with placing a bid, I don't think anybody would like that).[edit]With the approving-of-ads-feature, this problem should also be solved.[/edit][edit2]BTW, stats are available for advertisers, so they can judge better how much they want to bid on a site.[/edit2] People suggested earlier that that was a reasonable maximum size for an ad. I'll raise the maximum size limit. Give me a few minutes.[edit]Maximum size should now be 100Kb. Could you give it a try?[/edit] Thank you for your feedback. Yes, modifying existing data should still be implemented. I hope to add some new options soon, I'll see if I can take this with it at the same time.[edit]Coming back to this. If someone wants to change data from their site (Only name, url and minimum bid), send me a PM.[/edit] Ok, well... nice. I'll start in this order (also based on discussion from the other topic), starting this weekend.It will however take some time to implement each feature.1) Animated/XXX block (first animated ad is uploaded this week, so this becomes also more urgent).2) Advertiser refund3) Email notifications about bids (already spend time setting up an email server, that's working now). I'll have a look what happened here (after dinner). No idea though. The protocol (http://) is required for proper function, but there should be a check for that when it is entered.[edit]Fixed![/edit] gcc -vUsing built-in specs.Target: i686-pc-linux-gnuConfigured with: /var/tmp/portage/sys-devel/gcc-4.4.4-r2/work/gcc-4.4.4/configure --prefix=/usr --bindir=/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/4.4.4 --includedir=/usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.4.4/include --datadir=/usr/share/gcc-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.4.4 --mandir=/usr/share/gcc-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.4.4/man --infodir=/usr/share/gcc-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.4.4/info --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.4.4/include/g++-v4 --host=i686-pc-linux-gnu --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --disable-altivec --disable-fixed-point --without-ppl --without-cloog --disable-nls --with-system-zlib --disable-werror --enable-secureplt --disable-multilib --enable-libmudflap --disable-libssp --enable-esp --enable-libgomp --with-python-dir=/share/gcc-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.4.4/python --enable-checking=release --disable-libgcj --with-arch=i686 --enable-languages=c,c++ --enable-shared --enable-threads=posix --enable-__cxa_atexit --enable-clocale=gnu --with-bugurl=http://bugs.gentoo.org/ --with-pkgversion='Gentoo Hardened 4.4.4-r2 p1.2, pie-0.4.5'Thread model: posixgcc version 4.4.4 (Gentoo Hardened 4.4.4-r2 p1.2, pie-0.4.5) Fine with me.
I was thinking about a blacklist when the bid gets deleted (would be only for that website). One other thing I was thinking about is a sort of "pre-emptive" approval of ads. A list with all ads, that you can say if you like or not for your sites. When an advertiser does a bit and you already approved it the bid will be taken up in the bidding, else it will be held for approval.Not implemented yet. Seems people find the approval of ads more important, but I might do stats in between (because the approval is more or less in the poll (animated/xxx option) and stats are not (forgot to include them)). I can tell you that your site draws not so many people (only after you posted it there was a little spike) based on looking at the webserver logs. Code:g++ -c -O2 -march=pentium4 -pipe -ggdb -Wno-invalid-offsetof -Wformat -DFOURWAYSSE2 -DUSE_SSL -I"/usr/include" -I"/usr/include/crypto++" -I"/usr/include/db4.8" Â -o obj/nogui/main.o main.cppmain.cpp: In function 'void CallCPUID(int, int&, int&)':main.cpp:2981: error: PIC register clobbered by '%ebx' in 'asm'main.cpp: In function 'bool Detect128BitSSE2()':main.cpp:2981: error: PIC register clobbered by '%ebx' in 'asm'main.cpp:2981: error: PIC register clobbered by '%ebx' in 'asm'make: *** [obj/nogui/main.o] Error 1Doesn't seem ok.Code:void CallCPUID(int in, int& aret, int& cret){Â  Â  int a, c;Â  Â  asm (Â  Â  Â  Â  "mov %2, %%eax; " // in into eaxÂ  Â  Â  Â  "cpuid;"Â  Â  Â  Â  "mov %%eax, %0;" // eax into aÂ  Â  Â  Â  "mov %%ecx, %1;" // ecx into cÂ  Â  Â  Â  :"=r"(a),"=r"(c) /* output */Â  Â  Â  Â  :"r"(in) /* input */Â  Â  Â  Â  :"%eax","%ebx","%ecx","%edx" /* clobbered register */Â  Â  Â  Â  //:"%eax","%ecx" /* clobbered register */Â  Â  );Â  Â  aret = a;Â  Â  cret = c;} @noagendamarket, yes, but I think it should be a project on its own. You also want to have multiple people to validate a site and pay the people who are the most having the same answer (like 100 people, 95 say it is a spam site, 5 say its not, then pay the 95 people 0.01 btc each.Detecting malicious content will be difficult however, knowing about the situation that many people have it running on their computer without knowing it.I think the Approvable ads might be a good thing. However, how would such thing be implemented? Per website that contains the ad (allows publishers to have sites that need approval and some that don't) or per publisher (all sites of that publisher need approval).Also, when I would implement such feature I think it's better to store the bid in an "to-be-approved" list and only add them to the bidding list until after approval, else the algorithm to determine the highest bidder and the price for the ad would get overly complicated and/or slow. I haven't spend time on this any more. I'll do a check this evening. I've posted a new topic with poll to see what features are most popular to implement first.Please keep other discussion in this topic. There are now multiple features requested for Operation Fabulous. To get an idea of what people find more important I've set up this poll.The poll runs 4 days, which gives some time to discuss the way it will be implemented and hopefully allows me to start implementing it next weekend. Depending on the feature that wins it may take more or less time to implement.Details of every option:Advertiser refundNow only advertisers can send money to their account, but not withdraw it. This option is to add this possibility.Search function for advertisersThe amount of sites to choose from are limited at the moment, but might be a lot more in the future. This option will give advertisers a search box when placing an advertisement instead of the current list of all active sites. This option is a basic implementation that will be extended later (for this option will only search on basis of site owner, free advertising, URL and site name).Animated/XXX blockCurrently everybody can place all ads on every site. Publishers might want to restrict what ads are displayed on their site. This option adds these restrictions. It notifies advertisers that a site prefers not to have those types of ads. This option is a basic implementation that will be extended later (with stronger enforcement instead of notifying).More payment processorsCurrently we use the services of MyBitcoin for transferring bitcoins to an account. This option ads more (MtGox?) payment processor options.Email notifications about bidsHave the advertiser receive an email notification when his/her bid or account funds run low. That is always possible (even if content on a valid site changes after the ad is placed (e.g. a site defacement or through other (flash?) advertising on the site it links)). There is little I can do about that. If the malicious content is on purpose I can currently only remove the bid, ad, link or account of the advertiser in question and contact him/her through the email address (if that is valid).Most browsers however check these days if the URL is reported for containing malicious content and refuse to load the site if that's the case. Hard to say, but check this topic to get an indication:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2346.0 As a Publisher you have the possibility remove a bid from the list on your site. Viruses should in principle not be possible (as long as a browser handles images safely), because only JPEG, GIF and PNG files are allowed. Although an ad could link to a site that has malware, there is nothing I can do about that.Including a screening process would be possible, but that would mean that while a winning ad is not approved by you for your site, your site would display nothing or a placeholder. You would not get paid in that case.Like the "no animated ad" option, I could also add a "no xxx ad" option. But Advertisers that don't check the ad as "Animated" or "XXX" would still be able to advertise on your site. Ok, I've made some updates yesterday evening (mainly that forms have a bit more information).I also changed the handling of the advertiser fees in the way as suggested above.2 things:- Advertisers have been compensated with 2 x the fee they paid for their transfer(s) and has been added to their account.- The fee is now subtracted from the account funds of the advertiser that won a bid , for the duration of the bid, but not from the limit. This means that your account funds need to be more than the limit of your bid. (Bid will get deleted when account funds run dry). Ok, the bug about deleting the ads should be fixed now (there was another bug in the same code, fixed that as well, but shouldn't have caused any problems for users).About the payment, I think I might have found an easy way to to charge only active bids (the ones that display on websites).Currently the fee is on 2 sides, when people add the btc to their account and when the payout of the publisher takes place.Both are 5% fee. What I could do is move the fee of the advertiser to the payment of active bids.About the 2 account system and the links on the main page for the account menu:First, when you're logged in (as advertiser or publisher), click on the "Publisher" or "Advertiser" menu entry besides "Home". This brings you immediately to requested site. I can't put this on the main page, because there are different accounts for publishers and advertisers.There are a few reasons for this:1) The Publisher site is much more "simple", they only need to setup their website, whereas Advertisers have many more screens and options. I think that there will be more publishers then advertisers and don't exposing them the features they aren't planning to use is IMHO a pre.2) Splitting the accounts gives some better security and is something that helps later when the site grows and I need to scale up.3) Automatic payout for publishers would not be possible. It's even better. It is accounted per minute Yeah, this was already on my todo list, but not high priority atm.I will try to make some of the suggested improvements on the site this evening. I will also be in the #bitcoin-dev chat room. I'll try the other questions later, I have to go now (work).Please keep in mind that this site is FAR from finished. It will disappear, notification might be implemented later.Yes, many small bugs (the minimum bid warning, it's an rounding issue as things are stored as floats inherent to binary systems). I'm not a native English speaker. Thanks for the feedback.I left transferring back out, because I thought people want to use it all to advertise (bid on other sites of they didn't win on one).The paying fee over a "match" would be more difficult to implement reliably. This would also drain income considerably, as it is limited only to the amount of sites and not the users of the site.It was easier to implement than doing the whole transactions tracking myself. I also don't like captchas. I plan to include other payment processors later. The units are in btc/day.Lets say you do a bid on a site for 2 btc/day, with a limit of 1btc.This would mean that in 12 hours (assuming that you are the highest bidder and you actually pay the 2btc/day) you run through your limit and the bid will be deleted. If someone if bidding on the same page as well, but only 1btc/day , you only pay 1.1btc/per day (0.1 is the maximum value that is added, compared to the second highest bidder). In that case your ad will be placed longer, because it goes slower through your limit.There is however one exception. Lets say you have multiple bids running and being displayed on sites, but the btc in your account is lower then the total of the limits in your bids, bids will be deleted when the funds of your account run dry, while the limit of your bids would not be reached yet.The actual viewing is based on page loads. So the site loads, your ad is fetched and displayed and stays there until it is reloaded (if your bid is still active it is displayed again, else the one of a new bid is displayed). In your example, the views would be 100, 10 and 1. You would like the 100 more than the 10 or 1, so later, when the stats are implemented, look for the highest views.Depending on the linking to your site, this depends if the viewer is using javacript or the non-javascript way.Javascript: ad always links to your siteNon-javascript: if someone clicks your ad, while an other bid got active it will go to the site of the current highest bidder. Not nice, but there is no way to get the url to the viewer if he isn't using javascript. But you don't pay for that anyway.However from what I see now is that most people use the javascript interface. Most people in Europe do, to some extent. Here we see governments as a group of people who can be held responsible for their actions, if "the government" screws up, one or a few of the people has/have to come to the parliament (no excuses, like holiday) and explain. Fixed some small visual bugs yesterday. In some cases more than 2 decimals would be displayed and from the bidding/website details people can now click the url of the website to see the website.We have now one site that seems to generate quite some views (roughly 1 unique ip/3 minutes, currently I put down an ad there to point to the bitcoin website). With so many views I might want to start implementing stats soon I guess...  You mean Project Wonderful about the hourly I guess. Yeah, that's what I meant to say, just wrote it down in a non-clear way.Â   Thank you for your feedback. Should be fixed now. For advertisers and people who want to earn a few bitcoins with their site (publishers), there is now Operation Fabulous: http://www.operationfabulous.com/The advertising works by bidding for BTC per minute display, instead of BTC per click. Comparable to the way Project Wonderful works. I used the services of Kalyhost to rent a VPS for running the new Advertisement platform (http://www.operationfabulous.com).I'm very happy with their services.
I'll manage on my own. I think the community would be more helped with some other things (Flattr type of site?, seeing how many topics there are about donation and like). The only reason I accepted this was because there seemed to be some need for it. But if I need help, I'll let it know on the forum (as soon as I start generating enough revenue through this I plan to post some short paid jobs). Ok, here goes:http://www.operationfabulous.com/<edit>Please note that ad blockers might influence your experience.</edit> And WTF happened to their layout... turquoise on green? I hoped to announce it this evening, but encountered some bugs that I wanted to have fixed (and I had some time taken up by something else).It's getting late here again (and last few days have also been late), so I move the announcement to tomorrow (I want to be online for some time after I announce it). Unless more problems show up. It is was made as a Bitcoin Project Wonderful (Noagendamarkets idea). Kiba has now a site running on it, and earning a few bitcoins (mainly for helping testing). Although there are a lot of "blanks" (missing functionality, graphics and info how to do things). I'm planning to release it to the Bitcoin community soon and keep continue developing it.Many people are in to earning some bitcoins through their site, but I hope there will also be people who want to advertise (haven't heard them yet). It is based on a bidding system, payout in Bitcoin. Popularity of your site should drive the price for the ad space (in principal one ad space could make you enough, don't think that popularity should be a problem for your site). One risk is however, if only one (or nobody) wants to bid on your site. In that case the ad space is free for the advertiser, You could however set a minimum bid.I'll be in #bitcoin-dev this evening, I'll ping you if you're interested. My Bitcoin Advertisement site should be helpful for you. Hopefully I can get it up soon. Most part is running now (still testing), but having problems handling the payments properly. So, not today unfortunately . The Chinese have been tightly regulating their yuan (compared to the dollar). And now he starts complaining about the dollar?Â   It prevents to get an annoying popup/screen when you visit a ssl self-signed encrypted site.People who know about ssl know that they can mostly ignore the screen/popup. Other people get freaked out, thinking someone hacked the site and go away (at least don't trust it).I know about the startssl service, was just wondering if there were attempts by people to offer these services for bitcoin as well. I've been looking for an SSL certificate signing authority that accepts Bitcoin.On the trade site I saw that Exoware seems to offer them, but they only list prices in English pounds. Has anyone more details on this? Or know some other SSL cert authority that accepts Bitcoin? Send upstream for inclusion in the plugin? I can't really see that it is a hologram (as in real 3D). Seems more like lasers shining on a flat semi-transparent surface. (I've seen these things already about 15 years ago, although much simpler). More 2D to me then 3D to me. And then everybody goes : "who?". And nothing happens... If we would do that with every person/hacker on the internet, slashdot would be overflown with "Zomg, p0wnies, bbq, person x hasn't been online for x months".<edit>BTW, did someone tried to contact him through email?</edit> I'm afraid that that is a bit too soon. Currently setting up all the needed software, but I have to go to work today (bacteria don't stop growing over the weekend  ). There are also still some small things that need to be sorted out (last pieces of the payment code, etc., very important!).I'll do my best to get it running this weekend, but no guarantees. In that case... is this site (website/forum/domain) then safe? A.k.a. who pays the bill? Ok, ordered a VPS.Update:Small bugfixes. Of course I can also do my part and raise the price on Bitcoin Central, giving more people incentives to sell there.Just bought the bitcoins against a higher price.  Yeah that's a problem atm. I also are short on time during the week, so if I would order it now (the 200 btc is extra buffer, in principal I have now enough to order the service) I wouldn't have time to set it up. I'm also a person who doesn't feel comfortable with borrowing something (this counts double for money). I've placed an order at bitcoin central (200 BTC @ 0.2450 EUR) yesterday, that would give me enough btc to get started (and have a bit of buffer). I was also waiting for some answers from the hoster about their service, but that's ok now.If the bid does not get filled by Friday, I'll place an order for the service in the weekend. If it does get filled I'll place the order for the service earlier. With a bit of luck I'll have everything running by the end of January.
Oh. one more thing... space = space, not suborbital orbits. Minimum moon distance. @Hal, I'll be giving that a try this weekend.@ArtForz, it falls over that when there is no optimalizationÂ  in place (gcc default), with optimalizations in place it falls over the other part. I might donate, depending on what they want to do and how they want to achieve it.You might want to hint these people:http://www.marssociety.org/ Yeah, depends on the goals of the Space Program. Nobody uses the logs as backup and transactions can be re-fetched from the network. The only example I can think of, is when the client itself does a transaction and the client dies before sending it to the network, that may be only present in the logs. But in that case the logs will not be deleted and bdb takes them up at restart. Doesn't seem to be SSE related (building without SSE support also causes it to segfault). Assembly isn't in that function as far as I can see (might be in one of the boost calls though).I also noticed that the backtrace points to an other line then the one I saw earlier (still in the same function, only a few lines above, pointing to a memcpy), although nothing changed on that code. This where it points to now:Code:memcpy(&cpu, &a, sizeof(cpu));<edit>This seems to be caused by the changed optimalisation.</edit> Took some time. Removed all cflags except -ggdb. Same problem, it does however give an extra line in the backtrace (at place 0): memcpy@pltNo idea what to do with that. I think it has to do with:http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E17276_01/html/programmer_reference/changelog_4_8.html#id1655659Database or Log File On-Disk Format Changes:Â  Â 1.Â  The log file format changed in 4.8.db4.8 logs are not backward compatible with 4.7. I wonder if bitcoin really needs the logs (sync db before shutdown should remove the need to keep them). Yes, then I don't have to transfer the bitcoins that the clearing house earns to some other currency to keep it going. Plus it supports the bitcoin community economy. Some small bug fixes and a news section for the front page. I'm in the process of getting enough bitcoins to get this running somewhere for quite some time. MtGox and Bitcoin-central are helping me with getting enough bitcoins (yay for Euro transfers), but it is getting relative expensive. Using db4.8 already for some time here on Gentoo Linux. Never had any issues. Graph with transaction history for the past week? And current prices? It's just GPL without the web service loophole. Sorry for the slow reply. I've been at the parents-in-law for new year.Mainly a lot of coding on the background, some refactoring, and expansion of the ad delivery code. Have been doing some testing of the current system (internal payment and switching of ads when one finishes its bitcoins), but some of the new code still has to be tested. Some loose ends still have to be tied together. Maybe they can help you with this: http://www.torservers.net/ (See under services)At least they accept bitcoin as a donation method. From the way you describe how your government seems to block TOR I would think there would be more easy ways to do that. On the other hand, they don't seem to just block encrypted content. So, having 2 hosts (one in China, one outside) creating an encrypted tunnel and let bitcoin traffic going through that solves the bitcoin network issues (as long as they don't know what the two hosts are exchanging you don't raise any flag). You might want to have a few of these tunnels to prevent network splits in case one of the hosts goes down.On the other side, things to spend the bitcoins on... that is a different thing. I think however that it doesn't relate to the QQ coins (I have Chinese colleagues seen using QQ and always wondered what it was), mainly because bitcoin isn't limited to China (the Chinese government hasn't any control about internet outside China) and as Bitcoin keeps growing, it becomes harder and more expensive for them to block it. Waarschijnlijk bedrijfsrekening met KVK registratie en melding aan de AFM. Natuurlijk ook afhankelijk van de grootte van de transacties.Een handelsplatform zoals MtGox zou wel handig zijn, maar is denk ik niet makkelijk om goed op te zetten.Ik had van een mail aan BitcoinExchange begrepen dat ze ook bezig zijn om een MtGox-achtige site op te zetten, waarschijnlijk dat het daarom zo lang duurt. The website you mention:ONLY $25.00PHP Poker V1.9betaOpen Source + Domain LicenseV2.5 ($199) doesn't give you the source code, making it a lot more difficult to hack btc support in it. Ik niet, aangezien ik geen LREUR heb en daarvoor weer waarschijnlijk extra transactiekosten voor zou moeten betalen.Misschien dat skull88 ze zo hard nodig heeft om die extra moeite te doen. Ik heb er net een aantal via bitcoin-otc gekocht voor 0.25 euro per stuk. Iets duurder dan de omgerekende prijs op MtGox. Maar ik heb er nog wel wat meer nodig. Bod blijft dus staan.
So, why not hack bitcoin into your "expensive" script yourself? ($25.00 is not so expensive) I guess if you want someone to do it, it will cost you more than $25.00. You know what would suck (pun intended), waiting for at least 10 confirmations  Zijn er hier nog mensen die van hun bitcoins af willen? Ik heb er een rits nodig, maar ben bereid er alleen via een bankoverschrijving voor te betalen. Via een normale giro overschrijving of internationaal via IBAN/BIC systeem. Richtprijs is 0.20 eurocent per bitcoin. Dus bied maar wat aan, dan kijk ik wel of ik ja of nee zeg. For what? As far as I understand all transactions are public anyway, how would you else validate that person x paid person y and prevent double spending. SSL can even be worse for privacy, one part of SSL is cryptography, the other part is verification of identity.My point is, what piece of information do you want to protect? That would be one big dependency hell... So, how would DPI be used, filtering? Throw the whole stuff in ssl/tsl and DPI does not work any more. And random ports don't help against DPI.Else tor is your friend. Don't try to convince people who don't want to be convinced. Waste of time and energy. Just show them, if they are interested they will ask further.Focus on the positive aspects, easy and safe.. and micro-transactions. Don't compare with their bank account, but with their wallet. Small change that is easy for spending. Thank you for the suggestions. You could also update the wiki yourself.  But I'll do it later if you don't have the time. By installing the code you're not distributing it, but only using it. This causes the copyleft provisions not to be triggered.But on the other side, MIT (that bitcoin uses) isn't subjected to copyleft also. If you want to keep changes and extensions (derived work) to the released code also open, you don't want to go with MIT.And of course, saying this will trigger the whole GPL vs BSD discussion again. Fair... (although "the same open source license as bitcoin" might not be ideal, AGPL might be better suited for web-based service code).However... I won't be open sourcing any code before having it up and running and people using the service consider it as something they trust using. Releasing the code too early might cause other people jump on it and set up "half-backed ad services" based on the code (quick and easy money), causing users to be unsatisfied by the service (slow servers, (introduced) bugs, suddenly disappearing ad services, etc). This would not be good for the bitcoin community. I spend some considerable time and effort in it, so I also want to finish it in a controlled situation.<edit>Update:A small change in the algorithm of the updates to the database had a huge impact:System at 1.20GHz takes about 24 seconds for 30000 updates to the database. (Less than half the time for 2 times as much updates!!!)I've been coding a part that I call "Jeeves". He will be the one that will be doing the updates (cleans up old and expired bids, takes careof the payments and sends the money to the publishers). Jeeves will be running as a daemon (initially as a cron job).</edit> Not much of an update this time.I'll be heading to my parents for Christmas this afternoon, so don't expect to be happening much next few days.The thing that needs to be done now is the financial accounting for both the publishers and advertisers within the site.I've run some tests yesterday on my test system and I was slightly disappointed with the speed:System at 535MHz takes about 128 seconds for 15000 updates to the database.System at 1.20GHz takes about 74 seconds for 15000 updates to the database.(Project wonderful has about 7600 sites that it hosts ads for, so the 15000 updates is I think a sane value for a PW size of site.)Memory doesn't seem to be an issue (taking up only ~15 - 20 MB during the updates for the whole process).Disc IO was not a bottleneck in this test, but might become a problem on a live system.The database that I will be using will also be doing other queries and is larger than this test database, so actual updating of the accounting fields will be slower. On the other side, the host running the site will be much faster than the 1.20Ghz and I will be able to implement some tricks to make things faster and less stressful for the database. The receipt receives a normal HTTP POST response that you have to catch and "decypher". The lib isn't that big, so you should be able to rewrite it in your language of choice. New chain for Mars. Have some exchange, exchange between the currencies and handle the lag. Ok, the page is in the wiki.If it helps you implementing MyBitcoin for your million dollar business , consider donating a few bitcoins to: 175dFDZhnYHwVE9f5NA3aHqwaJZEDmKQ8b I guess I have to start writing it. See http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2336.0 Yeah, I know how it works. Didn't have time to write things down yet.<edit>I've written down most steps here in Mousepad. Need to validate some steps. Then I'll post on the wiki.</edit> According to the MtGox website it will be wire-transfer. Bitcoinexchange seems to be off-line for a few more weeks (I mailed them).I hope MtGox gets this working asap. computing power and luck  Update:- CSS Fixes that didn't show up in my FF3.5, but that I later saw in FF4.0b and IE8.0.- Keywords for publishers are now in. First 5 keywords per site are free, after that 1btc per month per keyword (if you put a keyword in halfway the month, it counts the remaining days and calculates the amount for the remaining days for that month).- Website detail page for publisher cleaned up a little so it looks better. Just delete them and see what happens.  (They will be re-downloaded from the network).
And a changelog for every release in the tarball would be nice. I've seen already multiple artists here, some have portfolios, some don't. If I'm going to need one, I would go with the ones that have a portfolio.You could also have a check up with the people of opengameart. You could try to raise some money here (or together with them) to provide some assets. @FatherMcGruder, rights are invalidated when bought through the NGO. You can't trade them any more (You would have to setup your own company and trade through that to do that). I also don't know how the price changes over time, but my guesses are not really profitable.@kseistrup, I counted with 1 euro = 1 dollar and a rate of 1btc = 0.25 cents, due to the fact that bitcoinexchange is off-line and I don't know their conversion rate. No need for hurry. It will take a bit more time to go live. But my todo list is getting shorter.What I did today:- Redesigned overall layout of the site. Now I have more space to put things down and it looks better. - Details about bids on a site for people who did a bid on a site (site details and see what other bids are placed on that site). Still needs to be made a bit nicer.- Deleting a bid is now possible for advertisers. I've used them from The Netherlands one, it was free.They also seem to be off-line atm. Hope they are back quickly. Ah. ok. Didn't know that. <Italian accent>Good day, I'm Mario of Marios Pizzas.I got your letter for joining your pizza site. I have one question:What are bitcoins?Best regards,Mario</Italian accent> Why not Europe wide? I think there would be interest for a MtGox like exchange that accepts euros. You could even do transfers via bank account, it is free within Europe. Did some minor fixes/improvements yesterday evening (you can't bid with the same ad on the same site again and ads respect the ad_type of the site now when placing bids).I have now everything in place for a test run today, PM me if you are interested in a link to the test sites and a demo running on a other domain. Well, I guess the hardware and software of satellites are nowhere comparable with laptops.(likely to have some embedded system running on a certified ARM cpu)And on your laptop bitcoin uses little memory, but it needs the rest of the system to run (boost, openssl, crypto++, berkdb). Donated some coins! No, you don't need to buy rights for your self (although you can now if the emissions bother you, that's the whole point of this topic).The whole system was setup as countermeasure and way to reduce the amount of emissions polluting industries by putting a fixed limit down.The companies can get fines if they don't follow the system (so, there should be no incentive for the government to generate more rights, there would also be easier ways for governments to generate money from pollution if it was only for the income), but you and me are not big polluters, so you and me are normally not involved in this system. The rights have a live time of some years, then new and less rights are created for the next couple of years. During those years companies do their emissions, but have also keep them in balance with the rights they have (instead of receiving fines).I think many NGOs are reasonable happy that this system is in place. If some government started producing more rights, they would notice and publish it into the media. This would cause people to not thrust the system any more and the government would have failed with the goal for setting this whole system up (and then people would start complaining why this system caused so much money).I can't help that some people don't thrust their government, if that's your problem, this system would be the least of your concerns. I never had the intention to start a political discussion with this topic, just to know if people are interested in this idea. Apparently not. I've got better things to waste my time on, so I'll step out of this discussion. Feel free to continue. Didn't make it for the proof-of-concept. While setting it up I noticed that some things didn't work like I wanted.Did today:- Fixed an issue with session stealing cookies (publisher could hop over to the advertiser site and have access to some users account, although in a production setting both sites would run on different spots, so that would not happen, valuable lesson anyway).- Hacked up a quick script to approve websites, so that they have setup everything correct before advertisers can bid on the site.- And (this took me long) Ajax doesn't allow cross-site scripting, doh. So I looked at how project wonderful handles this, and now I have something that works between different sites. Just needs to make it a bit more flexible (now it just dumps a static file).I'll shift the proof-of-concept a few days back (over the weekend?). I always wonder why the USA shows up their face at these conventions. They never take their responsibility (as one of the largest polluters) and are only there to protect their own market (at any cost apparently). Yeah, I'm not saying the current system is ideal. But the new round is already better then the first round (this being based on the EU trade system, people from the EU might be more interested in this then non-EU people.Also, agreements were made between countries (kyoto, millennium goals, etc.) about what should be achieved by when.Imho, these countries represent the people that live in the country. And like you said, someone has to coordinate it. But if we have to wait for someone to step up and convince everybody to participate with his/her scheme, it will not be happening.Yes, and methane is also a bad greenhouse gas (like a lot of others). The system is fairly new, so I'm not surprised that there are loopholes. That's quite a difference. The last link has this to say on this:Yes, American people might be sceptical against this system (and "Global Warming", I agree that's a hoax). I've seen people spend money on solutions that are having even a more questionable impact on the result (planting trees in 3rd world countries, where they first had to burn down some rain forest to plant the trees). It should not be about buying off your bad feeling towards the pollution you cause, but improving the environment where you (and the generations after you) live in.Giving companies incentives to invest in cleaner technologies is good for economies and the environment, instead of dumping waste cheaply and keep the saved money in some shareholders pocket. Yes, very. (I know it sounds silly).Here is some more info:https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Carbon_retirementhttp://www.carbonretirement.com/ <= UK company that does the same. Yes, carbon dioxide. The stuff that you breath out and is said to be one of the causes of global warming.I haven't set up a website yet, but will if people are interested in this.Of course you won't be buying CO2 gas (or dry ice), but CO2 emission rights (through a Dutch NPO). Strong polluting industries get/buy these rights from governments to do CO2 emissions, if they pollute more they have to buy more rights, if they pollute less, they are allowed to sell them. This drives the price of one emission right. Within a time span a limited amount of rights are released to the market, thus regulating the amount of emission.That's all nice, but individuals are normally not involved by this whole market. There are however a few companies/NPOs that buy these rights for individuals and let them expire (1 certificate guarantees that 1 tonne of CO2 is prevented from being released into the atmosphere). These expired rights can't be traded any more (The Dutch Emission Authority that regulates this market releases expiration certificates. The NPO sends it to the buyer of the expired rights). So, why would you buy these rights:1) By reducing your energy usage you can reduce your CO2 emissions, but there is a limit. With this system you can take out the remaining amount.2) Due to the market, prices might go up a bit. Giving strong polluters incentives to invest in less polluting technologies.3) Direct result of less CO2 in the air.Costs are 20,60 euros (around 80btc) per right plus 10 euros (around 40 btc) transaction costs (independent of the amount of rights bought).I will of course accept any amount and just add everything up.The idea is to setup a site where people can buy the rights. I'll transfer them to euros when we have enough to buy a few rights (transaction costs are quite high for one single right). The expiration certificates will be published on that site.Are people interested in this idea? Feedback, suggestion, questions are welcome. If the sites becomes big, you might want to use one of the hosting/vps services that accept bitcoins. Then your bandwidth concerns might become less.
bitcoin-9999 is a live ebuild (against cvs/git?). They can break. Make sure your patch is ok. You just have to validate the uploaded files as correct audio files, maybe a limit to the file size (only allow artists to upload, not normal users). Sharing an account will not happen that often I guess, because the friends might transfer the remaining funds on the account to themselves, change passwords (locking out other friends/account owner) or buy other songs that the account owner doesn't like. And how do you want to prevent that downloaded songs are shared outside of btcTunes?And put in you terms that misuse of the account will cause termination, resulting loss of all remaining credits linked to the account. Oh about the credits, that is a quite normal way to do. Just allow transferring forth and back. I've seen people doing it more often (and I'm doing it myself as well). Nice idea. However with the temporary download link. Why not link bought songs to the user and generate a dynamic 1 time/short time download link when the user wants to re-download it. last thing I would is to have to repay for re-downloading something I already bought. World-wide delivery? And if it's cold, it's free  A proof-of-concept should not be far away any more. Just to show in a test environment.I need however to make one script to allow bidding on the test sites that are entered while testing.And some things will have to be deactivated, because they aren't functional yet.I might even set up a test website with a functional ad box to show the results of the bidding.I'll see if I can put something in place tomorrow, then we could do some testing after that.Please note that the layout of the site is ugly, I've already been thinking about a better layout.Update for now:Bids are now viewable for the publisher on a detail page for the site that the ad is on. The ownerof the site has also the possibility to delete bids that he/she doesn't want on his/her site.(Spend a lot of time to get some javascript code in shape to show the ad). Maybe also an option to terminate old accounts (that you forgot about). Ok, I'll change it to 40Kb.Here is a new update:Placing bids works and optimal bid is determined (highest bid to win from 2nd highest). The advertiser can see all of his/her bids, but not if he/she is the highest (or the other bids on the same site). The publisher doesn't know anything about the bids on his site yet. This is something that I still have to work on.This morning I worked on a AJAX script to load the data for the publisher and to put on his site. Because I have 0 experience with JavaScript/AJAX I'm already happy to have something that works like I want. This script is very static, so also here a lot of room for improvement. For the gentoo ebuild I have been using the original thing for some time now (Gentoo policy is not to use bundled libs, as they are a security hazard). No problems encountered in more then a half year. Yes, I would donate (don't know how much yet). I see the value of such project. Running a bitcoin client seems pointless to me (I guess you won't be able to update it anyway). A niceÂ  bitcoin logo on it would be nice (I guess there will be press coverage of it). On the other side, posting here already gave you some visibility, maybe a link on the "Trade" page, that you accept bitcoins, will give even more. Also, I believe many people here on the forum are running blogs, they might make a post about this.About the last question:Maybe a Canadian trader wants them to buy you snacks/beer/etc. while working on the project.  (I doubt that you will get hardware, etc for them).Just some questions:What will the sat do? I know the project is for educational purposes, but if it doesn't do anything, you could as well send junk up there (and there is already enough junk up there).Within what time range will the project run and when will the launch be? Well, it is a bit small. If you don't know about PM in general. You might not notice. Different colour might be a lot more visible (like in red or so). IMHO, the small [number] of new messages is enough for me. Last thing that I want is pop-ups in my face. True, that was also, partially, my point. But I have no reference of what is a reasonable size. That's why I'm asking. Ah. Ok Emphasis mine. I find this funny. Ad uploading is working now (currently you can upload 4 different sizes of ads (square, button, banner and skyscraper), the script checks the type and dimensions of the image and rejects if they are not the right size, I used the same sizes as Project Wonderful uses), started already on the scripts to place bids. The forms for that are already in place, but no code yet to process the data.I leave currently a lot of possible functionality out to get this released asap (still, a lot needs to be done). After release I have to go back to some parts of the code to extend it more.For the ad upload I currently don't accept images not larger than 100KB. Is this sufficient for most people? Or should I make it even smaller/larger? (Kiba, both your banner and square bitcoin ad, that I used for testing, are smaller than 10KB) Zou een Serious Request Bitcoin donatie actie misschien niet een goed idee zijn?Gewoon een MyBitcoin account waar mensen op kunnen doneren. Of toch een iets andere opzet? What kind of emergency case are we talking about?Armageddon? What is the time span to need the money? 4. (The most obvious one.) Have someone providing the thing you need and accepts Bitcoin. Thank you to be a bit more clear.I'll pass however. I normally don't go to those places where you would get that (and my partner might object to have that stuff in house).Maybe someone else.
What "dutch thingies"? Wooden shoes and Gouda cheese? Or more of the green stuff (and related)? It was some time ago when I did this, hope I remember it correctly. I was doingÂ  an install from source. The "optional part" that I was talking about, was the location of MingW. The wiki says you could put it anywhere, but spaces in the Windows filesystem aren't respected, causing problems (I initially installed it in C:\Program Files\MingW).Could you please update the wiki page to fix it so the next person won't hit these two issues?[/quote]I'll put it on my ToDo list. I don't have access to a MS Windows system atm. If someone here does a fresh install with the new version on MS Windows, feel free if this is still an issue and adjust the wiki as accordingly.P.S. There is also a multiple-introducer, people might want to try that. MyBitcoin seems to generate a new address for each payment when using the Bitcoin client (as in not through a MyBitcoin account). Just put a button for that on your site. Worked on the advertiser side today (currently I'm busy with the Ad uploading). Databases are in place (although I might have to make some modifications on them later). Spend some time on the payment script (payment will initially go through MyBitcoin, later I plan to add MtGox as payment processor). And Bitcoin hits slashdot again (through this article):http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/12/12/0647203/WikiLeaks-Money-and-Ron-Paul I would not be confident that they are competent with their services then, if they make these obvious mistakes.Here is a nice quote to cover it: Ah. I thought you meant the email address. I've been following Tahoe-LAFS for some time now, and IMHO it is not suited for the thing I wanted to use it for. If people go off-line for some reason and the node doesn't say that to the introducer (e.g. network split, someone pulls his network cable, wifi?) the whole grid will become unresponsive due to the fact that clients try to contact that node. This is especially the case for small grids, on larger grids, this might not be such a big problem. But I haven't tested the latter. A people posted about this on the mailing list last few weeks. Email is not case sensitive. Are they going to use Tahoe-LAFS for that? Great! Hope to see more "open" projects accepting bitcoin. Good luck with that.  It looks like that there is a new Humble Indie Bundle in the making.The first bundle contained a few games (worth together $80), but peoplewere allowed to decide how much they would pay. In the end it was ahuge success. Would be nice if they would accept bitcoin in the next runas payment method. See http://www.humblebundle.com/ for more details. Nope, busy IRL (work) and got some other thing to work on (although I could use the knowledge that it generated for the advertisement clearinghouse). Now weekend (and holiday), so I will be able to spend some time on this next few days. Sorry, not yet. Have been busy buying a Christmas tree yesterday.  Any idea about the cause? Is it related to the remark of mtgox, that if they didn't have the dark pool, the price would be around $0.06? Building from scratch.Publishers can now register their websites. Next part will be working on the advertisers side. Next week I have holiday, so this might give me a bit more time to work on this. Sure, although there is little optimization in place. And the bit there is , is fairly standard (-O2, -march=pentium4, -pipe, -ggdb).Is "-O1, -ggdb" sufficiently unoptimized? Do you have any reference for that? Eh no, Julian would use his own name.
Why not in bitcoins? Cross posting into its own topic, maybe more people have more knowledge about these type of things,but might have missed it in the gentoo ebuild topic.Building bitcoind on hardened linux seems to cause a segfault when setting the amount of cores touse for generating bitcoins. Starting with -gen=0 doesn't trigger the segfault.-----Ok, I've changed one of my systems to a hardened system and was able to reproduce the bugon version 0.3.17. Here is the backtrace.

Sure  , just that I'm a person with little free time (doing a PhD takes up a lot of time).Â  Almost weekend again, so then I can spend some time on it again. IPv6 is hardly coming from the ground (you can do point to point encryption with that), good luck to get this implemented world wide scale. Also, your idea seems to generate a huge amount of overhead, which makes things slow. Nice idea, though. What would happen if there was NO public transport at all? The current amount of traffic jams would be nothing, costs for maintaining your good roads would go up (more traffic on the road), fuel prices would go up (more demand for fuel). While not direct, you will still be profiting from the fact that people make use of public transport.My bus this morning was transporting about average 60 people, most cars that I see in the morning have only 1 person in there. Let's say that this one bus would save 50 cars on the road (all going in the same direction)... and this is only one bus.  Encryption (SSL/TLS) works on a different level, that's relative easy to setup.The "kind of code" you mention would boil down to create an accounting system.I think I'll continue with my initial code (and maybe put something like openID in later),that's more straight forward to code. We have the same problems (car accidents and traffic jams), just not so many roads. The problem seems to me 2 fold:1) Not enough money goes to maintaining the roads or to many roads (the usa is too small to maintain all those roads).2) Incompetent people doing the planning (and probably paid to much for their work).Here the government has to go through some levels of government layers before they can actually put down the road.This takes a lot of time to get these things done, not only the different layers of government can be problematic, theyalso have to take care of activist groups, buying up the land where they want to put down the road (if the owner refuses it has to go through court). Because it is so difficult to put down a road, other ways to solve the problems (often traffic jams)are often much easier. Some road projects can take up more than 10 years before they can start constructing (if it isn't cancelledby then).One question though, do you pay tax for owning and using a car in the USA? How heavy is fuel taxed? (Looking at wikipedia we have the highest fuel tax (50 - 60%), USA hardly any tax). Which comes down to the point what I'm trying to make, everybody wants good quality roads, but doesn't want to pay for it, result: nothing happens and roads start to deteriorate, increasing costs to fix them even more. Here in Europe people are not so distrusting towards their governments as compared to the USA, because if you don't like how the current government is performing you choose a different party (or start your own, yes, that IS possible). Also ties with governmental agencies are short and the parliament can intervene if they aren't working as they should be. Hehe. That's only a 2 party system you describe (we have more parties). How about this one:Democracy is a dictatorship of the people.My point is that money isn't a goal (for self-enrichment), but a thing to achieve the things I mentioned (to improve society as a whole you have to contribute to it and participate in it). Money isn't everything... you want good roads, public healthcare, good education, subsidy to start your own company, grants to do research (generate knowledge), good/reliable public transport, etc., etc.? That's worth something, right? You might be someone who can take care of himself right well. I've seen a lot of people who can't, sometimes they didn't choose for that, sometimes they made wrong choices or were ignorant. I think as a society you have the responsibility to take care of these people, else you fail as a humane society (a US friend of my wife got homeless recently (and as far as I could judge this wasn't their fault) and all the organisations that could help them, are very bureaucratic and often don't have the funds to help). Some people might not agree with your idea's, but if you have more people agree with you you can make them happen, that's democracy. In transparent governments you should be able to track where money goes to. And here in the Netherlands we have relatively many ways to find these things out. If something isn't right, you can start asking questions. If money is spend wrongly you often see politicians turn their words in strange ways (and you know that they are wrong). Often not much happens, but it will get major media coverage. One recent example:A minister had to fly back from her holiday in Italy because of a situation that was discovered by the House of Representatives and she had to explain it and answer questions. She took a private flight back (costs: around 10.000 euro's, normal flight would have cost a few 100 euro's) and send the bill for a refund to the ministry. The media found out and in the end she had to make apologies and pay the flight herself.I think taxes aren't a bad thing, as long as they are spend again in a sane and good fashion, so that the whole society has profit of it. I voted Socialist (last few elections I voted the socialist party) although I like many of the communist ideologies as well (although they only work in an ideal world). IMHO the state should represent its people and take care of them. To bad our new government is right-winged and hopefully that will end soon. Not. I thought you didn't bother about that with the account-less system.<edit>To clarify a bit:For bidding to work you need to track the actions of the bidder and you want thatthe bidder is always the person who submitted the advertisement, so you need anaccount for that. If you have idea's how to implement that without accounts, I wouldlove to hear your idea.Let me know what you want, because I seem to be guessing every time what to do nextand if I'm doing it right. Last thing that I want is wasting time on things that nobody wants.</edit> I've been thinking about how to implement a semi-account-less system and started working on it.Most db's are in place, initial code for submitting and updating info to the ads database is in place.The advertiser will go to a website, uploads his ad and an url to link to and gets a bitcoin address.Then he has 1 day to transfer the bitcoins to that address and the ad becomes active until all bitcoinsare used up. Then the ad is removed.For the publisher it will be going to look something like this (the line he needs to add to his site to display the ads):Code:<a href="somesite.com/link_script.php?btc=bitcoin_address"><img src="somesite.com/script.php?btc=bitcoin_address"></a>somesite.com is the domain where the "Advertising Clearinghouse" will be placed.bitcoin_address will be the address of the site owner/publisher, where the earned bitcoins are send to. For every view of the ad the publisher gets some bitcoins. If the visitor clicks on the link, the publisher gets even more bitcoins. I know that this is sensitive for click fraud, but the only place to target that is in the script itself.The publisher will be able to register his address through the script, to have some control over the ads displayed with that address (the control needs to be done on the clearinghouse website). yes, but to keep track of approves you need some sort of account system. You're an adult. Behave like it! That's future gen... or we do just everything with those pressure pipes (much safer). Sneakernet... so 80's.This is the current gen of networking:https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers
Kiba, rethinking about what you said... something starts boiling in my head... maybe I can do both.Give me some time to think about it, how to implement it.<edit>Would need some kind of moderation though, else people might send "offensive stuff" or other crap through the advertising system.It would cost them btc, but still. That might harm the advertising system.</edit> I'm more thinking on a Project Wonderful type of implementation, with bidding on sites, etc. Also, later, I want to include stats of how effective the advertisement is/was for advertisers. And publishers might want to have some control about what type of ads are displayed on their site.I don't see how you could do this without accounts. Other ways of implementing might do without accounts, but then it will look a lot different, with less possibilities.noagendamarket and others, any comment on this? I guess this thread is more to get Bitcoin exposure/advertisement and not that it needs to be project wonderful, right?This might be helpful (advertising with bitcoins and even helps the bitcoin economy):http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=148 Sure, was already planning to do that. I've never used project wonderful, so some things might be a little different (and not have all the stats, etc. in the beginning).Here is the first update:- Designed the databases to store the publishers (people who have websites where they want to have ads shown on) and the websites (publishers can have multiple websites).- Moved some existing code of an earlier (temp. abandoned) Â project around and modified that registration page.<edit>Update for things I just did:- New database where Publishers can link keywords to their website(s) (no web connection atm.).- Restructured some ugly code, looks much better now.- Account screen for publishers allows now update of email address, bitcoin address and password.</edit> Looks all normal here (also FF). 6. Rule 34  Well I'm going to give this a try. Just to see how far I get with this (more bounty might increase my motivation  ). Why no 0.3.16? Moores law doesn't say anything about "computer power", only the amount of transistors on a chip. I also came here via the Slashdot post. Living in Europe, options for safe online payment are very limited, even more if you are, just like me, very sceptical about paypal and similar services (they are not banks and don't have to comply with regulations that governments put upon them). Although I have a credit card (they are not so easy to get here in Europe as compared to the usa), I'd rather not use it, because it puts me in debt of someone.Bitcoin doesn't have these side effects and I understand how they work, this generates some trust for me and I hope bitcoin will be accepted by many people in the future. Hoi Witchspace, welkom!Waar kom je vandaan? Thank you for the information.I've been searching through the code, but haven't able to find anything yet that might cause the problem.The part where genproclimit comes into play (until where it is the same as not setting it) is relatively smalland doesn't seem to do strange things. Also, as this code is also the same as the prebuild binaries it seems thatthe problem is somewhere else.Did you already try to get a gdb trace? (there seems also to be a -debug option, might be useful) Ok, could you give me some info on the system and your C++/LD-flags? Pushed bitcoin-0.3.15 ebuild to github. Do you have SSP enabled?<edit>Try the binaries first, if they also give problems, hand the problem to the devs. They might be quicker in pinpointing the problem.If the problem is not present in the binaries, we might have to add a build flag somewhere (although there is not much difference, compared with the distributed build scripts).</edit> Ok, I'll see if I can find out what is going wrong (please note that I'm not a C++ coder myself).The distributed binary works, right? Ahh... nothing beats good old non-constructive feedback. I don't think it LOOKS bad, but seems rather unusable (why need to register?, can't you just let people post messages that you review before showing them on the website?). You might want to record the idea in:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1268.0 My untrained eyes say, up until 0.23-0.24 and then down again. Trend is still negative. If it breaks through this barrier it might go up again, but looking at the current market depth, there are more sellers then buyers, so I guess it will not be happening. You could even put in a option to have monthly paying people not having the banner displayed.The current banner is not that annoying, but when "hit the monkey"-type of banners show up. 
Down here as well (The Netherlands). We had a few going down past 10 year (last one was of average size here in the Netherlands, see https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/DSB_Bank). Nice for those savers to know that they didn't loose their money due to something they didn't have control over. The finite number is good for 2 things:1) Our government says, don't bet it on saving accounts with high interest rates. People have to have some sort of responsibility. We had some big problems with people putting a lot of money on Iceave accounts (we all know how that ended). Plus the 100,000 euro insurance is per account (and the hope is then that people split the money and put on different banks). Plus it looks nice towards the tax payers (knowing that there is a limit of tax going into that).2) Yeah, unlimited printing money is good... no problem with that, right? We had 2 times, past 2 years that someone told people to get their money from the bank.It ended in that one bank got bankrupt (there where already financial problems, people getting their money from the bank helped it to get it bankrupt). The other bank (ABN AMRO) ended in the hands of the Dutch government, because if that one would go bankrupt the whole economy would be severely damaged and even more banks would crash. I think banks have to have at least 7% of their money in free available form. In the latter case only a small percentage was withdrawn (government even raised the insured amount of savings in case a bank would go bankrupt (to 100,000 euro if I'm correct)). So, how is this supposed to work? (/me does not facebook)I don't think many people will do anything with this (at least in The Netherlands).Haven't heard anything about this on the news yet. Ah... Chinese people and their prestige projects (they really like them).IMHO they do a lot of things that have a high "look at us" factor, but poorly executed to be really useful.Reminds me of a conference in Vienna on radiation induced mutagenesis in plants.Chinese big boss steps up for a presentation, tells some story about sending seeds into space tohave them irradiated by cosmic rays (all fine so far, from a scientific view, but the real added value might be little).Then someone in the audience asked how much radiation the seeds received. He couldn't answer and I think theynever measured. Ouch.. epic, expensive fail.I've got a few more examples of these type of things. Do note that there is also a lot of good research done in China,but when a lot of money is involved it is often spend on the easy stuff (a.k.a. build a super computer) but theefficiency to use it can be a lot less. I think it is the IRC bot in the bitcoin channel. I think it should be reformulated, because in this way there could be exceptions. This is the same like Godwins law, but that one is formulated a bit different (If a discussion grows longer the probability of mentioning Nazi's or Hitler goes towards 1). If it were formulated like you do we would have a forum full of topics ending in discussions about how Nazi's would think about what Bitcoin would be. Now if we have the same penalty in there as is in Godwins law (e.g. mention the question what bitcoin is and you will loose the discussion and have the topic locked). That would be great.  Just see if your system is sane, if it is I'll contact you for the whole strace. Wxwidgets isn't needed for bitcoind (the cli daemon). Yes, a complete strace would be more useful. I don't see anything strange in this part.Did you also try ebuilds before 0.3.13, did they give issues?Also give a bit more information about your system (is is x86 or ~x86 for example). bitcoin-0.3.14.ebuild is on github. Do you have setuptools installed? Did you try a reinstall of setuptools? And what version?It seems version 1.8.1 will be released within 2 weeks that will have binary packages of all dependencieswith it bundled. Might make a few things more easy. Someone is trying to do something against the difficult installation of Tahoe-LAFS:http://tahoe-lafs.org/pipermail/tahoe-dev/2010-October/005415.htmlSomeone might want to try out his tree. I see my Makefile.gentoo got reverted to an older version, caused by an update by mizerydearea. That is causing the problem.I'll see if I can get my version in again.<edit>Corrected Makefile.gentoo is in github again</edit> I'm normally not a big fan of using development code from a cvs, but anyway.Did you already try to do the following?:Change to /home/kiba/projects/tahoe-lafs/and runCode:python setup.py build Strange, easy_install seems to be part of setuptools. Could be different with your distro though. Google says that setuptools should be installed. No need for encryption, tahoe does that for you. That is why tahoe is so great.For debian you need to add a repository to your sources.list, see the install page. Well, I had a check on a Windows system today. You have to go through some hoops to get it working (the description is not completely correct in some places and doing some things slightly different might help a lot).Here is how I got it working:No problem here. I've used Python 2.6.6, which is out now. Install it in the default location (C:\Python26).Just install, no problems here.3. Now install MingW as described in the "What if that doesn't work?" part. Install it in C:\MingW This is not optional as the wiki might suggest.I used file: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20100909/mingw-get-inst-20100909.exe/download It is important to check the c++ compiler, base system, development system and the build system when you get that option to select it. This is different then what is told on the wiki.4. Then continue with:I installed this initially in C:\Program Files\Tahoe-LAFS. This does not work. The space in "Program Files" causes problems, so install it in C:\Tahoe-LAFSAfter the cd c:\Tahoe-LAFS there is a directory below that ("allmydata" or something) cd into that dir also, the wiki doesn't say to do that.From this point on you can continue with the normal installation (point 6) with one modification. The wiki says that the tahoe script is in C:\Python26\Scripts, well, it isn't. It is in the bin directory in where you did the setup.py build command C:\Tahoe-LAFS\allmydata-something\bin\I know this is written down a bit confusing, I hope to provide a more clear "Howto" later, when I have access to a windows system again.
@jorgen, Good idea, but I think it's better to have a introducer or helper node then instead of a storage node. The amount of disk space would be too limited to be useful I think (25btc per week for 100MB?). They might even be able to collaborate, they could use the grid to add redundancy for their servers (they use raid1 now) or as a service for their customers in return for a permanent introducer node.@Bit-Lex, I wouldn't install a linux-VM if you don't need to (you could better use the disk space for the grid itself  ). If you scroll a bit further down on the install page there are instructions on how to install tahoe-lafs manually. You could try that. About the storage encoding:The storage encoding contains two values, often written down as a, for example, "3-of-10" value.In this the 3 means the "split". A file is split in 3 shares (a 100 MB file would each have 33.3MB per share).The 10 value means the redundancy. Put each share on 10 nodes (doesn't need to be the same).If one node contains one share of your file and it goes off-line you have 9 nodes left that still have the share.3 shares (on 30 nodes at most) are needed to rebuild your file.Also note that the 3-of-10 value gives a total file size of 300MB.3-of-10 is a quite conserved value. Personally I think it will be better to have some other values, because of the natureof our grid: many users with limited availability of shares.How about 4-of-20? (100MB file will be 500MB total)I will be initially providing a node with around 10GB of space (partially on-line). Having setup a Tahoe-LAFS node. Zooko (one of the developers on this forum) gave the following tip:So, with this topic I'm starting to setup and coordinate a Tahoe-LAFS grid among the bitcoin users. It's goal:- Setup a grid that everybody can join and use (e.g. for backing up your wallet.dat and other files).- Encourage the Tahoe-LAFS developers to put some more effort in a bitcoin integration for Tahoe-LAFS and help with ideas of how it should be implemented.- Use the grid as a test bed for the bitcoin integration.What do we need:- Storage nodes, the more the better. Can be desktop systems.- Introducer node(s), to connect the storage nodes. I think we need a few systems that are permanent on for this.- (Optional) Helper node, to have things uploaded more quickly for users with limited bandwidth. Also a system that is permanent on and has a large bandwidth.What we need to discuss before we start:- The storage encoding for the network.Documentation for starters and how to set things up:About: http://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe/trunk/docs/about.htmlInstall: http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/wiki/AdvancedInstallGentoo: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=220018 I've got a storage node running now (Nicknamed "Sjeng"), connected to VolunteerGrid.@Zooko, any news on the bitcoin implementation in Tahoe-LAFS? eeehhh..  I haven't encountered that yet.<edit>I do notice that sometimes the reload hangs.</edit> Ok, played now a few times.One thing. Don't have it refresh on the result screen (I walked away and came back, empty grid and a lost game. Would be nice to see what the other player did). And show both individual selections (both users). Ah wait, they work on the whole grid.How about pay price compared to grid size? Small grids cheap, large grids expensive.Example:3 squares = 0.10 btc5 squares = 1.00 btc7 squares = 10.00 btc I've read the description, but only get half of it. Are the squares only compared horizontally, or also vertically?Anyway, I've put in my squares . http://www.biddingpond.com Nice.  I don't use MtGox, but the website says:Mt. Gox charges no fee and is free to use. Donate a few BTC to help keep it that way: 1EuMa4dhfCK8ikgQ4emB7geSBgWK2cEdBGWhy not use that? What goes up...That and the first bitcoin bubble? Does this mean we'll get a drop in difficulty soon? I already thought about this problem. I came up with this idea:Have bitcoin (or some proxy program (I was thinking about this for my pybitcoind-desklet program) in between) start a dbus daemon that accepts "bills". These "bills" list the receiver address, the amount of bitcoins, the program sending the "bill" and possibly a transaction description. On receiving the receipt, the user gets a pop-up/notification about the "bill" to pay it and the user is free to accept or decline the bill. After that the money is send or not.Via this, possibly every program has a standard interface to connect to for sending bitcoins and there is no direct connection to the rpc interface, so malicious programs can't do any harm (e.g. sending rpc commands that it isn't allowed to do. Which comes down to something I was thinking about this morning...We have now many people offering their services for bitcoins. That is fine and all, but how about post (other topic) if you NEED something and you are willing to pay by bitcoins (tell how much you are willing to spend at most). A bit like the pizza topic some time ago, I think that one was quite successful. I heard octopus Paul is retired, you're already looking for a replacement? Did you try Knut already?  I know, but it was more meant as a pointer. Because it is the only option?And people who want to donate differently wouldn't bother the hassle. Somehow they don't seem to be that big yet (not as big as bitcoin):metacurrency : no real software, only some flash widgets.opencoin: academic researcher project and has lawyers, lot of info but no real downloadable implementationgithub: server and client code, but looks alpha stage, no gui, no real website, centralized?Of all 3 the github one looks the most promising alternative, but none seem to have places to spend the currency.
Make a German topic here:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=11.0And I don't think the other forums have moderators (are Germans in such need for moderators? De they behave so badly?). Please note that Bitcoin was also on the frontpage of Freshmeat.net yesterday (I created a record for it). So every ehh... "slot?" is balanced differently?How do you prevent major flooding of area with people where one "plant" has a high win chance?That people go to lucky "slots" and leave the unlucky "slots" untouched?BTW, you will need to change the art a bit more to make it more "Chinese"-themed. I mean, palm trees? I'd expect more bamboo Now it looks more atitd at night with some Chinese thingies. WOW, great! Sounds interesting.Do you have some screenshots of what to expect?And the requirement of the bitcoins, are they for playing in a way you could lose them? Can you win more bitcoins? Or, you're very, very, very lucky.  Nope, this is imho nothing more than a correction. The only thing to watch out for is damage of the Bitcoin "brand". From the source:If [vanity] is specified, is less than 10 characters, and is all valid base58 characters, then an address containing that string is generated. Can I use this to generate an address like "12kUimDnb1a6oAPifgavinAaxMmLe43UR6"?  (I know it will take ages to do.)Or are there limitations to the address?Nice addresses that contain:"SendBitcoinsToBioMike""ILoveBitcoins" I've bought some bitcoins through them. Everything went smooth.No experience with selling bitcoins though. Meh... you don't want to know some new "European" rules that where forced upon Europe by the US government.Doing bank transaction (within Europe)? => Your info goes to the states. Can be in bulk, the US will filter it out what they need. (This is already in action)Want to travel to the states? => Hand over all your private data (including "what eat on board of the flight", your sexual life, credit card numbers and email addresses). And of course these data are to be shared with the US allies. Even our Dutch privacy law has already been changed to allow this. Or in a Tahoe-lafs share. Indie game developers?There are already 2 who have adopted it http://www.atitd.com/ and http://www.stronggames.com/They might even help as a reference or in some other way.Some hint of who might be interested: http://www.wolfire.com/humble I think that would be the way to go. If the patches are right you could build it with USE="cuda", but the program would just not use it. People with Cuda hardware could then test it for you. As CUDA isn't in the main releases yet, I'm not going to include it (my goal is to get it as stable as possible to get it included into the main gentoo tree). Mizerydearia is taking care of the live ebuild and might want to include it.  Thank you for the explanation. Wow, 5000-ish btc. That is more than I expected (about 20x more, based on nothing). True, that's why you need to keep up with the difficulty. 1st month : 1 machine2nd month: 4 machines3rd month: 16 machinesÂ  <== would we be able to get a bulk discount on that etc.Or will the difficulty catch up to quickly for that? Lets see, 30 days has 43200 minutes.1 block (50 btc) every 4 minutes = 540000 btc.540000 * 0.06ct = $32400Man, that's a nice extra each month  Or use this for the stability of the network. Let me explain:1) People donate bitcoins to buy this service.2) Service starts crunching for a month.3) Yielded bitcoins are sold in an exchange.4) Money is used next month to use the service again (aka go back to 1).Advantages of this system:1) Even people with powerful computers can't control the network.2) No hassle to keep track who gets what (if they want the bitcoins they buy it with the money that saves them the next month, what they would have pledged).3) If people keep putting money in this, it becomes stronger (enough money to buy 2x service, just do it).4) Even not rich people can join. http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs <= Check the nice bitcoin button on their site.Funny, I've send 10 btc also to them yesterday.Seems to be an interesting project.
I think answering abuse is also important. Just one question out of curiosity. How much bitcoins are you getting in your wallet? Doesn't need to be accurate, just an estimate. How does this reflect overall donations?B.t.w. How many people are administrating the servers/foundation? I think also that,Â  that is the case.  Ah. I was under the impression that we still would have access to the bitcoins (because, other people mentioned to donate them to some other organisation). Asians have a "different" internet. I work with some Chinese people and when they surf they mainly visit china-centric websites and hardly visit the sites that North-Americans or Europeans usually visit. I think this counts for a lot of people in Asian countries.So there might actually be many Asians using bitcoin, but we will not be knowing. Or there might be no Asians using it, just because they haven't heard about it yet. "If we don't hear from you before <some_date> we assume that you are not interested in the donation and we will find an other organisation that might be more interested in this donation."Or something like that. Chart/statistics are here: https://www.bitcoinexchange.com/statistics/But I understand what you mean. You just want to trade between different currencies.Personally I think people should actually buy stuff with it, not speculate about the transaction values. Ehh... why? I've got bitcoins from them before. I was very satisfied by their service.Btw, The Netherlands here.  https://www.bitcoinexchange.com/ is already in Europe (Finland) I'm not a supporter of donating something and then later (when they are not interested directly) saying, well then give it back. Especially because many people donated to their cause, not some other organisation. How do you think (let's stretch it a bit far) if people donated for the WWF and saw their money going to the PETA, because the WWF was not interested but the PETA is.Personally, I see two options that I can feel happy with:1) Keep the account with the bitcoins for a few years and send an automated mail to the EFF yearly. If bitcoin really catches the market they might become more interested.2) Contact one of their sister organisations in other countries, asking if they are interested. <edit>For point 2, mail the EFF with an ultimatum for the EFF to collect the coins.</edit> bitcoin-0.3.13 ebuild is now available. Made some small changes in the process (bitcoin is C++, so renamed the CFLAGS to CXXFLAGS).Have fun. Thanks for the answer.@nelisky, I've done a couple of sending wires last few years and never paid anything. On some consumer programs here on television a few years ago people had the same experience as what you are saying and the hosts of the show said then that there are 2 ways of sending. One being free (maybe capped to a specific amount) and one that costs money. Many banks had this way of paying with costs as a default, but that has changed since then, because the banks got a lot of complaints about that. Why the high expenses? Wire transfers within Europe are normally free. Maybe, they could be made sticky? Like https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Pandora_%28console%29 ? Yeah, easy to find. I'm just back from the Software Freedom Day party here in The Hague and I was able to talk with Bits of Freedom (Dutch privacy organisation) and the president of the Free Software Foundation Europe about Bitcoin. Both were really interested. The person of BoF knew bitcoin already, but hadn't used it for over a year or so and said that it was not interesting at that time, but he would look into it again and discuss with other people within the organisation about it.About the FSFE, the president asked me to send a mail with the details, so I just send him this mail:I've blanked out the names.So lets see where this goes. I always liked to use PeaZip, FOSS and support for many formats.http://peazip.sourceforge.net/ Spam is not a technological problem. And you will be unable to solve it with a technical fix.This idea is the same as email stamps. 1) Dollars, we can't spend them here in Europe . Joking aside, money transfer is fairly easy within Europe, outside it will be more difficult or very costly. Buying stuff from the US often requires a credit card, which is not so easy to get in Europe as in the USA.2) Webmoneys, these companies are not banks, so they don't have to follow the rules that banks have to follow. A company could just "freeze" your account or let your account disappear and get away with it. If someone hacks your account, money lost. Nothing you could do against it.Bitcoin on the other hand is easy to get (bought some via an exchange in Norway via a bank transfer (safe)) and nobody can make the bitcoins I have disappear (or have some other control on them). From the website they say that the organisation will form a foundation.I don't know by German law, but here in the Netherlands foundations have often the requirement to publish the finances to its members and/or chamber of commerce (where they can be requested from again).
Voted with my wallet.dat.Â  10 btcKeep up doing the good work. Why does he want bitcoins donated if his code can generate them? Is this a similar scam as we saw earlier with a GPU client?Not that I care that much, I don't have a CUDA gpu. You could attach an already encrypted text to it, right? Damn, that's hard to read. With a quick view, it looks solid/usable.Might be more useful/structured as an oo class. WhooHoo!!! Also the proposed "committees" might become to powerful and bureaucratic after some time, whois going to keep them in line? Committees are already some sort of centralisation... what you might not want. Second that. Interesting idea. How about encoding grades in the certs? A teacher could judge, based on the cert, to accept a student who is willing to learn (show by many high grades) and who is just trying to get certs ("just passing" grades). Export/import function for private keys? Whooh there!!... I'm not trying to be against you. Just trying to have a normal discussion, nothing personal. It is normal that people might have different opinions about something. As for my reasons in this discussion, see below.Ok, to be clear about my point. I've been using FOSS for over 15 years now and I don't care if it is GPL or MIT. They are both open source and free. That is the pro against closed source licenses for me. If a developer chooses one or the other, it is his choice, I can't force him to use an other license if I haven't written any code myself. If I don't agree with this, I write my own code and place it under my license of choice, or I shut up. I would love to see the/a client under a GPL license and I think I would prefer to use that one over the MIT one, but there is currently no GPL one, so I have to do with the MIT one and that is fine with me (as long as I have the basic rights that define it as FOSS).Now, back to the GPL vs MIT discussion. Both licenses were once made to give the user the freedom to use the software how he/she wants to use it. But the licenses have a different view about the freedom. GPL restricts the user in taking these freedoms away (copyleft), making it in BSD eyes less free. BSD/MIT on the other hand give the freedom to take freedoms away from the user. Two different point of views causing a dilemma about which one is more free. But, IMHO both are valid to use. Personally I don't mind the copyleft restriction of the GPL, but you also have to respect other peoples opinion that this "hypocritical" restriction should not be needed in the first place.I have enough thrust in FOSS that the open source MIT client will keep its leading edge over future closed source ones as long as it keeps actively developed and keeps support of its community. Then those users get what they deserve for using a closed source version, while a reliable open source/MIT version would still be available. If the closed source version is eating their bitcoins they will abandon it soon. There is even the possibility that some person develops a closed source version from scratch and does the same, no MIT/GPL/other license of the current bitcoin client is going to change anything on that. "Bitcoin" should get a freshmeat.net account. That will give it some exposure (especially with the many releases). I think many people loose interest when they see that it is very difficult to generate bitcoins. But buying bitcoins isn't so hard, so getting them is not the problem. I think more in the lines of being able to spend them. Sure, there are some nice ways to spend them, but many things are a bit of a niche currently (relative little people have real use for it). If I have a look in the first few topics in the Marketplace, I see financial related stuff and lotteries/poker related stuff. None of which I would be interested in.Also, please note that amount of forum sign ups doesn't need to be related to the amount of people using bitcoin. Ehh.... Macho, bitcoin IS open source. MIT license IS a open source license.No closed source, proprietary software or DRM here. 1) resend again to same address2) resend to informatio AT eff DOT org3) If you live in the US, send a fax or the letter via snail mail.4) call them.https://www.eff.org/about/contact Updated the ebuild on github for version 0.3.12. You could have a nice bit of money now, if you stayed then.  Protocols are IMHO not licensable anyway.If you do clean room reverse engineering, you could make a compatible interface to a protocol and would not have to agree with any license. Heh... no clear view of the current software world? If you see how many different "duplicate" software packages there are, duplicate work is done a lot (for various reasons, even licenses).I think even on this forum people are working on a second client (the python client). Having multiple clients does not have to be a bad thing. Nice. How about being able to set <destination> as a config option and have the function called after every send(/receive?) of bitcoins?
Hell no, NTP does a good job. Don't have other services changing the clock (also counts for bitcoin). Right tool for the right job! IMHO there is no reason for a modern system to not run a NTP client/daemon. There we have the whole "FOSS is commie" discussion again.Â  I think the use of which FOSS license isn't so much of a deal. I mean, there are a lot of licenses that fall under the OSI definition. And MIT is not so bad. I normally put my software under the GPL, because I like the fact that it is copyleft. But if another dev thinks an other license is better, who am I to judge (I didn't write any code for it). This is the same discussion as GPL vs. BSD (MIT being almost like the BSD license). Message says:"bitcoin-0.3.11 ebuild from BioMike" My current ebuild is now also available from github. Please test. domo is not usable in this case (bitcoin doesn't use the standard gettext localisation (po) dir). Bitcoin doesn't handle gettext directly, as far as I can see, so no dependency on gettext. I've also made an start/stop script and I see 2 problems that I also encountered and was challenging to find a good solution to overcome them:1) Your bitcoind runs as root. A possible bug that would cause some attacker to run his/her own commands through bitcoin gets root access. <edit>Ugh... it does change user</edit>2) Stopping bitcoind is done by sending a signal to the daemon. I don't know how good bitcoind tries to close its databases, but I've had once a database corruption when killing the daemon. On the bitcoin chat people advised me to to send the rpc stop command to stop it (and call start-stop-daemon later again to clean it up), checking the debug log can give some information if it is closing right (flushing the database files). Best would be that bitcoind closes itself properly after receiving a kill signal. Some interesting tips in there (last part), especially the domo command. The gui/daemon flags aren't a big issue currently. Development of an ebuild isn't working to an end point, but always ongoing. Splitting isn't useful here, can be done, but the package is IMHO to small for a split. On my side, documentation (readme and license) are installed, and a .desktop menu entry is made when the gui is installed (to start bitcoin from the menu). Did some permission fixing for /var/lib/bitcoin (daemon), but not validated yet if it is correct. wxGTK 2.9 is already in tree. I've already send mizerydearia an ebuild with makefile to build bitcoind and bitcoin based on use flags with autodetected berkdb, cflags and ldflags. Also localisation files are installed based on LINGUAS. For bitcoind init.d script is installed that seem to work fine under the bitcoin user. The ebuild isn't finished yet, but it is getting along. Give them some time.... it's not like that the only thing they do is checking their email for donations.  Ach, Nederlands, Vlaams... misschien zelf Zuid-afrikaans.. Lijkt genoeg op elkaar om elkaar verstaanbaar te maken. Ah. Ok. Thank you for the info. So, what CPU's support this? Is this only the newest AMD ones? And how many systems are we excluding because of this? Doesn't -march break abi with older systems? I used the live ebuild as a base to make a new ebuild against 0.3.10. The daemon seems to build fine, but for the graphical client I still need to adjust the Makefile (whole wxGTK part is missing there), but the ebuild already takes most of wxGTK into account. The daemon/graphical client are build on basis of use flags. Ok, put my 35 btcÂ  in the escrow.

One other thing that might be nice is an init.d script to start and stop the daemon at boot. <edit>oh... it's already there.</edit> Some things:1) Remind that you will need to fix the header.2) wxgtk is only needed when building the gui, not the daemon (make that use flag dependable)3) gtk+ is then dependency of wxgtk, don't ask for it yourself.4) Check other programs if and how they use wxwidgets through eselect (you can have 2.6 and 2.8 slotted on the same system, you will need 2.9)4) /home/bticoin?5) Strip optimizations from the Makefile and let the user provide them (or strip them properly)6) Don't build static code.

Those use Lua and C, not python. And I don't speak Lua or C. But feel free to make something yourself  Just a question. I Have a VIA Epia MII with a C3 processor (with padlock). Will this also work on that? Or is this nothing to bother with? Sorry, I also agreed with those terms, so I'm not able to link myself Go to biddingpond and click on the "Terms and conditions" link in the bottom. Hmmm. yes... that makes sense. Did you get permission? Or are you violating the terms and conditions that you agreed on when signing up?Â   @mizerydearia, I think the quote button is easier to find then the reply one. So, theoretical this is a first control system where <some goverment> can arrest satoshi and demand that he hands over his key (or get it from his computer) and shut down the complete network?Or is that not possible? How far would <some goverment> get? FYI. The problem was already solved. Great you like it.  I've been adding some features past few days. I think it's time to release the first version.Happy downloading/testing/using:http://project-seeds.org/pybitcoind-desklet/pybitcoind-desklet-1.tar.bz2Please provide some feedback, even when everything works. Fine with me. There are 15 people who pledged (based on the opening post), but only 6 have said something so far with regards to an escrow. Could they respond? No, I'm just saying that the daemon doesn't need WxWidgets. Or build only the daemon and not the graphical version. Then no WxWidgets are needed. I think something like that should be possible to make. But making it is something completely different. Do the server logs say anything useful? Yeah, it might work with non-techie people... But even blocking cookies altogether would make this not work.But then again, it doesn't hurt. I WANT YOU TO BE MY ESCROW!!!! (if others also agree)Â   There, I said it! teknohog couldn't have explained my view better.Yes, I understand why 2.9 was chosen. And I think it is also reasonable, but just unfortunate for people who just want to install the dep from their distro. (Under gentoo it b0rks up building other Wxwidget apps when having 2.9 installed into /usr/local) WxWidgets is not really a problem. My problem is the version that is used (2.9), which is considered unstable by many distro packagers (although the WxWidgets devs say it isn't). On the other side, as far as I know WxWidgets uses gtk under Linux for drawing the whole stuff and makes it for the bitcoins devs easy to make things cross platform.I think I would go with theymos in that the gui and daemon should be separated (or put the whole protocols and stuff in a library with bindings for different languages for that matter). I've already gotten my own "client" running (see http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=851.0) with the daemon (who doesn't need WxWidgets anymore) and it works very nicely. So, in my case I don't have any dependency on WxWidgets any more. right permissions? Lekker Nederlands praten hier!Voorburg hier, nog anderen uit Nederland?
