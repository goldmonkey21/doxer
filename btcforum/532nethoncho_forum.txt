When I was your age, I believed in unicorns also. Do not think for one minute that any money the fed may get from payments on the bail outs will pay off any debt.  I got my 8 BTC and just sent in 8 more to play the next Pic 6. Hoping 80000 is lucky for me  Thanks!   My address is 14D9sKXkXYzMENZCri7XpcNftzVznVdzTwI played one of the games on your site in the past... I would like to go for 8 :-) I use Prio to set (and remember) the priority of bitconhttp://www.prnwatch.com/prio.htmlAnd it is free (as in beer, not speech) Just sent 0.01 Both failed to accept a connection. Maybe a firewall rule? Post your IP and I will try again... I just sent 0.01 to 14 different IPs, I tried all of them, but some were not responding. Also I just noticed that the send coin dialog only works with IP address, not host names.Also I got one reply on the next block cycle!
