Please PM me reasonable offers.I will be happy to use escrow or other means to protect buyer/seller. I thought I would add the relevant explanation from https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html :As for the reasoning why ATI has always licensed Armory under AGPL 3, it was an attempt to balance the benefits of allowing other people to see and use the code, which is absolutely critical for security related software, against the costs or lost opportunity associated with a third-party using it to build their own commercial platform. (I won't speak for Alan, although he and I had lengthy discussions regarding the choice of open source license years ago).As a developer, once you release code with a license that is very permissive, you cannot re-license the released code with a more restrictive license. So, for example, if you release your code with the BSD license and then find out that someone is making millions using it as the foundation for their offering, you cannot go back and get value from them. Therefore, using a more restrictive license like the AGPL 3 from the start allows the developer to ratchet the license down on a case-by-case basis as users request.Using the AGPL 3, we thought that it would either 1) force code into open source, which we thought was a good thing; 2) force developers to talk to us, which we also thought was a good thing.Please don't misinterpret that when I say "custom license" that it means it has to have a price. If someone wanted to experiment or start their business using Armoryd, we certainly could talk about a no-cost license for a period of time. btchris,I am Armory Technologies, Inc.'s COO and General Counsel, and although I am not an IP attorney, I can hopefully provide a brief response to the problem that you have highlighted regarding a great deal of open sourced software and what Armory's intent has always been regarding its license. We hesitate to make any modification to the AGPL 3, since we are relying on the critical mass of acceptance of AGPL 3 that give it its legal credibility.ATI believes that the use of Armory or Armoryd, licensed under the AGPL 3, as a backend application that interacts with any information from the Internet, causes all software in between Armoryd and the Internet to also be AGPL 3 licensed. Therefore, the source code is required to be publicly available.We encourage developers who desire to customize or use Armory/Armoryd in other processes to contact us regarding custom licensing terms. If you seek to run an exchange or webshop with Armoryd as the backend and you do not want your exchange or webshop code to be publicly available under AGPL 3, then a custom license is necessary. Thanks for the report. Armory (currently) uses HappyFox for its support portal, and the error was on their end. The link to Google+ login has been removed. Subo, is there a way for you to automatically update your seedbox(es) when Armory updates the torrent? Would an RSS feed be helpful? rNFqB5pHxyFwQgF2sUh4X9YxkZPvgibXJN Disclaimer: IANYL, nor may I provide tax advice.If you want to avoid all the craziness of accountants and lawyers (now), form an LLC. They are laughably easy to form. From a legal standpoint, you get the benefit of limited liability. That way, if anything does come up in the future (completely regardless if you have been doing everything correct or not), your personal assets are not at stake or at issue. From a tax standpoint, the IRS has made it as easy as checking a box on your individual 1040. The LLC is a "disregarded entity" in the eyes of the IRS, and its income is reported as your individual income. I do not know what you forego in terms of being able to claim deductions of the business; talk to an accountant. Looking for advice here, because I've had a few people interested but none will accept using ClearCoin charity.  Without using charity, I cannot see how I (as seller) am in any way protected in the sale.Am I being unreasonable in trying to further build trust (e.g. proving my real identity so you can come knock on my door, sue me, break my knees, etc... or a telephone conversation for starters), and/or use ClearCoin charity?Using ClearCoin takes all the risk away from the buyer.  But it gives them too much power because they can simply not release the funds and wait for them to eventually be returned.  They end up with my card and the money, and I end up with nothing. I would try if a client seriously offered and the BTC price was relatively stable at the time.   Selling a XFX HD 5970 for the BTC equivalent of $575 including shipping.  Latest Ebay sales have it going for $580-633, but I'd rather not give Ebay and Paypal the fees and pass the savings on to you!  I currently have it running at 815 MHz and hashing at ~700 Mhash/sec.  Edit: soldHD597ACNF9http://xfxforce.com/en-gb/products/graphiccards/hd%205000series/5970.aspxI am an attorney in Wisconsin and will provide more information if necessary to assure you that I am not trying to run a scam.  I am also willing to use a third-party mediator or ClearCoin charity. Many thanks for sharing this software.  I have it running a box with 5770x2 and a 5870 and is generating beautifully.  On another machine, I have a 5970 and a 5870, and the Speed is being displayed incorrectly:Code:[hashkill] Version 0.2.4[hashkill] Plugin 'bitcoin' loaded successfully[hashkill] Found GPU device: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Cypress[hashkill] Found GPU device: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Cypress[hashkill] Found GPU device: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Cypress[hashkill] GPU0: ATI Radeon HD 5800 Series  [busy:0%] [temp:50C][hashkill] Temperature threshold set to 90 degrees C[hashkill] This plugin supports GPU acceleration.[hashkill] Initialized hash indexes[hashkill] Initialized thread mutexes[hashkill] Spawned worker threads[hashkill] Successfully connected and authorized at btcmine.com:8332[hashkill] Compiling OpenCL kernel source (amd_bitcoin.cl)[hashkill] Binary size: 349352[hashkill] Doing BFI_INT magic...Mining statistics...Speed: 172 MHash/sec [cur: 24%] [proc: 128] [subm: 98] [stale: 3] [eff: 76%]     The "proc" and "subm" are going up, indicating that it is submitting shares near the expected speed.  "aticonfig --odgc --adapter=all" returns that all GPUs are being fully used.I have attempted with and without -D and -G 1 to -G 4 with no change on the display.  I am running ATI SDK 2.4 on Ubuntu 10.10, Intel Xeon 3.0 GHz, 8 GB RAM. I will take a guess that the discrepancy arises because BTCMine uses a score-based method and not a proportional-share method.  So your calculation should be based on your "score / total round score," rather than "your shares / total shares." Hello,I have set up a server using poold.py, which I understand was experimental and development has been discontinued.  Is there any other released code to run a pool server?  I don't need a fancy web interface, and want to manually add user/pass into the database.  Poold.py seems to satisfy my basic needs now, but I know there has been development of pool software and I don't want to lose coins if I have a bad server setup.  All I am looking for is simple tracking of number of shares contributed.The idea is that a small number of friends and I want a pool that we can assure is "fair."  Not that I necessarily distrust any of the current pool operators, but there's an extra level of comfort when I know the contributors in real life. I didn't realize that the Mac dmg was already posted to a different thread.http://heliacal.net/~solar/bitcoin/Bitcoin-MacOSX-Intel-svn-75-opencl-2010-05-10.dmgLooks like it is a little outdated.Any chance of the opencl code being patched to the current SVN version? OS X 10.6.4Geforce GT 220.Thank you!
