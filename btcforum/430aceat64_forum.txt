Im trying to understand some of the basics of block chain. From what Ive read, a ledger is being verified by multiple people for transactions but who are the people verifying the ledger? Does everyone verify it? And what incentive is there to verify it? Hello fud spreaders and others who think they know best. The whole market lies behind so lay back or take a long holiday. In time we will see growth not in a few days. ###TWITTER WEEK 5 (25.06-01.07)###   Twitter user URL: https://twitter.com/karishmarayyan   <date of shares/likes - list of tweets/retweets>   01.07.2018   https://twitter.com/karishmarayyan/status/101341384274606899223.06.2018   https://twitter.com/karishmarayyan/status/101059498326986342729.06.2018   https://twitter.com/karishmarayyan/status/1012733765779689472Facebook WEEK  5 (25.06-01.07)   Facebook user URL: https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1   <date of shares -list of shares>   01.07.2018   https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/192922864712759623.06.2018   https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/191624719842574129.06.2018   https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/1925944007456060      comments   01.07.2018   https://www.facebook.com/ankhlabs?comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D23.06.2018   https://www.facebook.com/ankhlabs/photos/a.370247400150782.1073741828.312391835936339/378730682635787/?type=3&comment_id=379268215915367&comment_tracking={"tn":"R"}29.06.2018   https://www.facebook.com/ankhlabs/photos/a.370247400150782.1073741828.312391835936339/384090968766425/?type=3&comment_id=384581205384068&comment_tracking={"tn":"R"} Если посмотреть его мериты, то он не попал в струю, так как их давали на протяжении нескольких месяцев.

Вот это труд. Забрел на тему через просмотр меритов автора... Теперь точно буду участвовать в его платном канале с отобранными кампаниями))Блин, я тут херней походу страдал ранее Не читал всю ветку, что реально так разговаривает представитель команды?А я в этот проект верил только из-за герасименко и тут такое, печаль конечною.. Hey everyone, new to this forum. Just bought some keys. Just wanted your insight on what you think this coin will be at by end of 2018. К сожалению со всеми этими баунтями, ico, трейдингом и т.п., в телеге развелось столько всякого хлама, что реально уже на форуме снова становится общаться проще As I understand, the reason of this upward movement is still unknown? Could someone manipulate the price at this level? Would it be possible that some kind of chipolino puling the strings in order to create an artificial wave? Too many question.... Is that promising that NEO has gone from position 6 to position 13 (!!) now, with No 14 close enough? Any thoughts on that? Very supportive words from a guy that has been involved in the early steps of Internet.@IOTerry on Twitter"The entire crypto space is going through some tough times right now but this is to be expected. Those of us supporting IOTA are going to take some arrows in the back but only time will prove us right or wrong.Every new paradigm attracts the naysayers and the path to success is rarely a straight line. How many people tell you they should have bought Amazon when the Internet was starting up? Today it trades at $1,660 but check out how it fared for a few years following June 28, 1999. From a high of $113 in early Dec 1999 it fell as low as $5.67 in September 2001 before the long climb back to dizzying highs. Does that look familiar? How many saw the bear market as a twice in a lifetime opportunity in 2000/2001?IOTA is the second of those twice in a lifetime chances. Are you going to miss this one too?"twitter.com/io_terry/status/1011301029529321472 Relax my DGB brothers. The market will ebb and flow and trolls will come and go. When the market improves the trolls fade away and the crazy ignorant optimistic investor shows up. When the market is down, the trolls roll back in. Its just what we need to put up with. When DGB starts its recovery we wont see the new trolls for awhile, if not ever.  I know XLM hodlers are faithful but maybe we should use 20% of our holdings to swing trade.it covers the loses of devaluation (if done with success ) and increases the volatility hence attracting day traders and increases the volume. Just a thought.. and I'm doing this currently. There is a useless troll in this forum, who keeps posting negative words about DGB all the time, as if it were only the DGB that was in decline at the moment, the whole market is down, and surely all the currencies will fall further, instead of being worried, I stay is happy, because this is the opportunity to buy more coins, who has never dreamed of a moment like this  When the market was up you looked in the mirror and said to yourself, I should have invested in early 2017, as I would like a new chance to be able to buy these coins at a lower price, so smile your big chance has come and maybe it will not repeat itself again, when this market starts to rise it will be like a rocket, and you will want to be regretting once again for not having entered that market, or this time will be smarter and will embark on that trip ?? It's your choice.Remember right now all good projects are falling, including DGB, but do not doubt the potential of this currency in the long run, the DGB team is incredible, go to their official website and follow their script, go to twitter and be inside of all the news about DGB, you will be surprised. Last night was the 2018 Global Blockchain Technology Development Conference hosted by @peopledailyusa. Extremely honored that #IOST was named the Best Public Blockchain (Technology) of The Year and I was named as Best CEO. There's a bright future for #blockchain in China!-> twitter IOStoken!   ###TWITTER WEEK 4 (18.06-24.06)###   Twitter user URL: https://twitter.com/karishmarayyan   <date of shares/likes - list of tweets/retweets>   23.06.2018   https://twitter.com/karishmarayyan/status/101059498326986342722.06.2018   https://twitter.com/karishmarayyan/status/101024612800729497620.06.2018   https://twitter.com/karishmarayyan/status/1009507375559200768Facebook WEEK  4 (18.06-24.06)   Facebook user URL: https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1   <date of shares -list of shares>   23.06.2018   https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/191624719842574122.06.2018   https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/191507808520931920.06.2018   https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/1911791402204654      comments   23.06.2018   https://www.facebook.com/ankhlabs/photos/a.370247400150782.1073741828.312391835936339/378730682635787/?type=3&comment_id=379268215915367&comment_tracking={"tn":"R"}22.06.2018   https://www.facebook.com/ankhlabs/photos/a.370247400150782.1073741828.312391835936339/377694852739370/?type=3&comment_id=378594372649418&comment_tracking={"tn":"R"}20.06.2018   https://www.facebook.com/ankhlabs/posts/375806206261568?comment_id=376630486179140&comment_tracking={"tn":"R"} Согласен с бро. Перспектив роста в ближайшие месяцы вообще не вижу.В 2017 был норм хайп, была новая кровь, форки и т.п. В 2018 ничего этого нет, ждать теперь ток релизов и роста конкретных монет, а не рынка в целом Well I finally dropped the hammer on a few giota at 1.13 I have some more orders in down to about .92It sure looks like it's being manipulated to me Long candles on the sell offs Bless their little pea pickin hearts It was clear that we had the darkest days and I chose to stay and I believed that XVG could give me everything
SONM is a sleeping giant of 2018!When livenet be released, I hope that will big companies join to SONM.Awesome developer team & community, top 50 coin in a short time for sure  A very young ICO but already in the top 25. And same with TRX its releasing its mainnet within this year. Pretty impressive. Definitely will hold this one Sometimes i am joining this Forum , but its getting more and more rare. A Lot of Trolls...It is Always the Same: If you want to win you have to do the opposite of the Mainstream. I Just see a big potential to grow in this coin. It is already in use. And has a big Billion Dollar company as PARTNER !!!! Trolls will now say things like "porn coin" ...but think about it:. Why is someone interested to spread FUD or abuse any coin? They just want to buy in low....you can just lose selling now..its Just a Matter of time,when Verge will get more massive Partners ..and Just a Matter of time to get Independent of BTC....Partnership with tpay will pave the way.. Много слышал про семуксы. Много видел подписей. Видел продажи и покупку на форуме этой крипты. В чем суть, в чем такая особенность, что она прям популярна? Все верно канеш, вот только будет ли смысл фрилансерам так заморачиваться, если есть куча площадок, где они могут разместить свой профиль без каких-либо тестов Уважаемый, а что за дроп.

It's not just Stratis. All the proclamations of "scam" are crazy. The futures trading has really brought the market down, coupled with over-hyping. It's still a valuble technology, and although I am certainly nervous I would not go selling off now. Wait untill the fall or winter, it will probably over-inflate again like it did last year. That's when you should sell. Met with the DMT team at E3 this week. It was awesome to see them at the largest electronics expo in the world! DMT is working to get some news games on their list and moving towards great things. ###TWITTER WEEK 2###Twitter user URL: https://twitter.com/karishmarayyanhttps://twitter.com/karishmarayyan/status/1004072459316940803https://twitter.com/karishmarayyan/status/1004381909328285696 Judging by the fact that prices are again in the red zone to wait for the revival of the cryptocurrency market, one should wait later, most likely closer to June. There is no negative news, but the market then starts to grow, then falls again, it's like a game of traders and people with big capital. Bitcoin, of course. I don't think Litecoin will be able to beat the top cryptocurrency of all time. Litecoin is just created out of sheer interest and belief in the idea that built Bitcoin. In this sense, Bitcoin is the original version of Litecoin. Of course, in terms of investment I would also include Litecoin in my list but if I were to choose only one between the two, I would go for Bitcoin. Basically there are two reasons why I joined in this forum. To gain knowledge and earn of course. Reading posts and comments here is very helpful to understand what is happening in cryptocurrency world. People are sharing their experiences either bad or good. Early adopters giving advises to other member to prevent some mistakes. The cryptomarket has long been ready for growth. Many large whales have come with their huge investments. Large investors openly stated that they are ready to invest a part of which they get from the usual stock markets into the cryptocurrency. I think that this is the beginning of a big growth. I advice you to read and read everyday, learn the basics of the cryptocurrency, how it works, what are the latest news and the further developments. In order for you will decide where will you venturing if you will be planning to trade. As for the forum you must visit the meta section and the FAQs, those thing will help you a lot and prevent you for doing mistakes which may lead you to sanctions from the moderators of the forum. hope this will be helpful for you. It depends on you and the project you are holding into. Most of the time, token price tends to get dump at the release of bounty rewards which will dramatically lower the price. It would take months or even years to regain the original price if the project you are holding into are not that good. But there are projects who are really into the coin where they spends lots of money in marketing. If you think that the project would not succeed after the ICO, then I think you should sell those but if you have faith in it, then hold. It really depends on you and your research. Ripple, unlike other cryptocurrencies, it is regulated and facilitates fund transfer for banks. Ripple is working with some of the biggest financial institutions around the world. XRP aims to power the whole financial sector by making instant transactions possible at a fraction of the current costs. Many banks from around the world are actively working with Ripple to implement its technology over their payment infrastructure. It makes XRP trustworthy, and investors find XRP to be a comparatively safer bet as compared to other cryptocurrencies. Time to buy more and mоre Ethereum but not to the extent that you will all in your entire investment to Ethereum alоne. That is not good, since all your worth will now be depending on a single cоin if that is what you are planning to do. And it only takes a single prоblem оf that particular cоin for your pоrtfoliо's wоrth or value to dive. Just add some more coins to your pоrtfoliо. Bitcoin's price is also very lоw. Actually, it isn't suggеstеd to buy Еthеrеum using all your monеy. It's vеry risky. You should diversify your investment portfolio. You can buy Ethereum and other coins like Rpple, Litecoin, Cardano, Stеllar, еtc. It should to do to minimize your invеstmеnt risks that you may incurrеd. But decision depends on you of coursе.

It is difficult to talk about the whole market in general, but even in these difficult times for the crypt there are several coins that keep still promising. I think that among them is NEO. I read that there are now developments in the field of software or a program that can recognize a scam based on an analysis of many factors. I hope that this is real. Why?

I'm completely disappointed in the long-term investment, because I have not earned at all on the Ethereum for the past half a year .. Most of the ICO I participated in brought me a small benefit and I will not say that this is generally a lucrative occupation. Bounty programs for me are more interesting) Unfortunately, I could not stand it and sold most of my assets and now I really regret it, because in general the market is stabilizing. I think that now the market is changing and Bitcoin's influence is decreasing. I think it is good, because know BTC is not stable and too vulnerable.

I believe that one of the most successful teams now has got Ethereum, because they have achieved really tops and the rest have a lot of things they can learn from them There was such thoughts  that this dump simply never end and there is nothing to do in crypt, but now all is good... I'm very worried that more and more websites are beginning to block advertising cryptocurrency. I hope that this trend will not last long. I think that the crypt helps all the world's capital to distribute more readily among all segments of the population, but this is in the long run. The market has always been very vulnerable to FUD and other fake news, but the fact that a lot of online resources are opposed to any advertising cryptocurrency is really very frightening... I prefer to invest in Stellar and Waves, this is the basis of my portfolio and look forward to them this year Week #7 (12.03 - 18.03)Twitter Username: @karishmarayyanTwitter URL: https://twitter.com/karishmarayyanFollowers: 2018Tweetshttps://twitter.com/karishmarayyan/status/973837585834545152https://twitter.com/karishmarayyan/status/974560914111377408ReTweetshttps://twitter.com/riconaofficial/status/974259995805126656https://twitter.com/riconaofficial/status/974940991206682624Facebook Username: @karishma.rayyan.1Facebook URL: https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1Followers: 5000Postshttps://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/1802519666465162https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/1807062789344183Reposts and Likeshttps://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/1802519449798517https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/1807062516010877 It is only worth looking at the coin rates and you will immediately realize that not everything is as cloudless as you imagined it.

While I choose between Ledger Nano S and Trezor.
I lost a lot in January, but by the end of February I  already turned money back . A hard winter has turned out Cryptosociety implies decentralization and the opportunity to participate, but how to solve such issues? It is quite suitable. I started using it recently and it suits me, because it is quite simple to use and reliable I'm beginning to despair about the crypt as a whole, I think that since the end of last year much that has changed in the crypt generally and not for the better and not only with airdrops I think that to believe that in the near future there will be absolutely no cash at all this is stupid. In the future I think that cash will simply not be needed Week #5 (26.02 - 04.03)Twitter Username: @karishmarayyanTwitter URL: https://twitter.com/karishmarayyanFollowers: 1318Tweetshttps://twitter.com/karishmarayyan/status/969150781931884545https://twitter.com/karishmarayyan/status/969866198086242304ReTweetshttps://twitter.com/RiconaOfficial/status/969110795656318976https://twitter.com/riconaofficial/status/970205174148026368Facebook Username: @karishma.rayyan.1Facebook URL: https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1Followers: 5000Postshttps://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/1786478871402575https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/1790857314298064Reposts and Likeshttps://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/1786478718069257https://www.facebook.com/karishma.rayyan.1/posts/1790855594298236 For the time being I collect myself a summer vacation.

All equipment is worth such frantic money that I'm not sure that I will not even return them I'm starting to lose patience because there are more and more scams, but there are no ways to fight it I am confident that in the near future it will again gain momentum and increase in capitalization, there is every chance to believe that it will overtake Bitkoin in the future the situation on the market is more favorable than it was two weeks ago. I'm going to buy NEO, I'm just waiting for the right moment I agree that the bounty had better times, but who knows, may be everything will be even better. So I think its not late to start doing it) In order to earn on Airdrops you basically need only a wallet and an account on the forum and that's all I earn an average of about 1 thousand bucks, but I'm not ready to increase the volumes yet. This is quite enough for me Maybe it's some kind of FUD, but if it's true then it's just awful.

Can I delete the signature? The old good method of buy cheap sell it expensive as always the best. Such jumps on the market make it possible to earn even more money, the main thing is to choose a promising coin Basically, I'm always skeptical about forks, in order to find out whether it is reliable or not, you need to understand the crypt itself, all the main characteristics of coins I love crypt mainly because of the opportunities that it gives. With the cryptocurrency on the block chain platform, you can make many global things and it's incredibly exciting The very personality of Satoshi Nakamoto or a group of people is very popular, because people love riddles, and even more like to build different speculations. Such a discussion is meaningless Now the network has a lot of fake news about the causes of these problems with the site, one says that this is an upgrade, others that the site is hacked. I did not meet the official statement anywhere so the only one thing is left is to wait.. To reckon a whitepaper is the most boring occupation, especially at first when you hardly understand anything in the crypt. I try to see the roadmap and the main characteristics of the coin In Europe, while everything is quiet okay, except that Facebook is a policy against the cryptocurrencies in their social network. The main thing that other popular social networks do not follow this tandency This is a very detailed instruction on a right selection of the project, ideally to choose the ICO so at least 4-5 hours, I try to take into account the main criteria such as the characteristics of the coin and roadmap. I'm skeptical about the changes, because they do not always change everything for the better. What to expect from mycrypto.com and what wait in the future from the company is hard to say I panically fear to leave something on my wallet and immediately withdraw all funds, most likely due to the fact that I'm not sure of reliability and there is always a risk of getting on a phishing link .. Taking into account that the Asian countries market as China and Korea are some of the biggest, I think that the government's negative actions on the currency significantly affect their development Now there are so many fake news and FUD in the network, that it's hard for me to believe in something, there are a couple of resources that are verified, for example https://www.investopedia.com/ This year a lot of tokens and coins appear that are not even able to reach the exchangers, so I doubting to bet on something new and the most promising for me is the Ethereum, Ripple and NEO Hi guys! My opinion is according to all posts in this thread there are quite a few normal Airdrops. But all depends on your luck, because I cant know for sure what tokens even reach to exchangers I'm more than confident that now I need to invest in Ripple, but it's hard to say how much you will earn on it, all depends on when you invest your money and how ull do this: the whole amount or investing small parts Heyy everyone..I would like to ask some of you for your opinion on litepay.As this weekend or this month that is going to launch.What would be the least price expectations??As it is a very big achievement and i expect a good price jump.Any guesses ??
Folks remember this event. Chance to see the tech team explain the vision for Tron.#TRX #TRON $TRX TRON technical team will have a live stream on Periscope at PST time 18:30, Feb 11th, 2018. They will talk about the architecture and landscape of TRON and community developer program, Please see poster for more details. https://t.co/f8s1GvNSTe I dont get it. Why should Neo be a winner? Neo is described as Chinas answer to etherum. But as far as I know, China is banning all treading with Neo and other crypto Hello aTrizPlease delete line 268 in the campaign telegram spreadsheetI made a mistake Do You plan on listing it on top exchange markets? I suppose it could drive the price up, because on Zaif it's quite hard to trade with anybody but the Japanese, and YoBit is experiencing a low volume of sales and, hence, YoBit is not really popular. If You do plan to list, then when approximately do You plan on doing it? And where? Hello, I have participated in Your Bounty project. I really liked the project. Can I please inquire, after ICO will there be a change in the terms/conditions? Why was't it implemented earlier, as planned? Which obstacles prevented You from implementing it earlier? Can You please explain what makes the eidoo wallet so special? I have seen that they paid quite a lot for bounty, and the project is expected to be successful in 2018. But why? Isn't it just a regular wallet for ETH and ETH-based tokens ? NEM, for example, has a similar wallet... Why do You think Your particular wallet will be popular? Aren't there similar ones already there for mobile devices? I really liked the app, but as always I have some concerns regarding the app security. Do You offer any guarantees regarding the app security? Can You expand on it (provide me with more comments/insights/explanations)? Do You want to involve all the exchange markets or only the specific ones from the Top List? You have indicated that You have already had some experience in the field of bitcoin/currency exchange market. Can I please inquire what specifically were You doing/working on? What were Your responsibilities? Which members/what part of the team were working on it? Can You please kindly list some examples from Your work? In which region do You plan on developing Your exchange market ? Asia, I suppose? I have been participating in the project Bounty on Bancor several times. I really like this project. I feel like there is less competition there than here on the forum. I also think the price of the token will go up, as more and more companies/enterprises will participate there and more and more bounty participants will consider this platform. The fundamentals for this crypto are excellent.very great team...so for Verge to hit $3 or more this year is not the question if... just when...Good luck guys! Thinking we might see 60 Monday or Tuesday, probably will be the last chance to stock up before lite pay kicks in.I am all cashed out so have flat to buy. It's a perfect moment to invest in Linda:- It has been attacked and dumped to the ground. It is now solid and at a good price- Linda owners receive 70% interest rate.- It is going up, event in $ cripes! down we go again! gotta have balls of steel or a titanium twat to withstand that urge to sell on the artificial high. been around long enough to not fall for the whale trap. I have had NEO on Binance for about a month. Shouldn't I have received some GAS by now? Is there a special wallet on Binance, or does once just leave it in the usual "funds" section? Bankera aims to empower the Pacific Private Bank with bank-level blockchain technology and has taken the first step towards this by joining forces with the Private Bank, and also connecting it to the Ripple network.Read the details in the article of Coinidol dot com, the world blockchain news outlet: https://coinidol.com/bankera-announce-acquisition-of-pacific-private-bank-limited/ Well BCN fans, I'm a man who keeps his word. For several days, beginning January 5th, I was posting that I purchased BCN using BTC and my wallet was never credited...which was true. I also posted that I sent about 2 dozen emails to Jenny and crew which were never answered...also true....until about 3 weeks later, but still no coin. Then today, I decide to check out the forum and I saw a post from bcnezas123 stating that BCN wallets opened with BTC have finally been credited. I logged into my BCN wallet (after totally giving up) and I see that it has in fact been credited with the BCN I purchased, 20 days later. Okay, so it's not XRP, it takes a while (Laugh with me, it's a friendly dig!!!). Being a man of my word, I PROMISED I would put up a post if the coin showed up, and it did. LONG LIVE BCN!!! Now go get rich, dammit!! All my buying indicators came up again and here is 17% profit with free fiat. Same fiat ammount is out while 17% stayed in Iotas and added to my stack in wallet. This time was not so successful as previous two times with both 40%+ but it was my fault because i was to early with first level buying at 2 USD and didn't wait for last indicator to show up.Waiting for indicators to show up again, patiently. If i was a Merlin i would sold , not only verge but all my coins to save in usdt for times like this... To sell at lost is not existing anymore in my world... SO whats the best solution is ... BUY AS MUCH I CAN NOW. Had to load up a whole bunch more today! Nothing changes with the outlook for FUN just because btc is screwing everything up! Great opportunity to have more FUN! I liked this better when I woke up at 4am and saw it at $600... You all think it will get back to at least $450 today or continue it's fall from the overnight pump?
Bitcointalk username & UID: aceat64 & 430Current number of Posts: 166TUNE Address for payments: TA5wrHwxDkq3mPi1R4bd1gcRrRC4DjpJuw My opinion. Great idea great technology. Didnt like the premine operation but as wee see someone have to pay for marketing ans innovation. My price support is 300 curent price ia low because of the low market at all. Cant see it price tag 4kor not this year but who knows crypto is strange. To rise in price big whales have to pump it and then we are next little fishes. Hope they dont eat our investments. Me personally i sell at 350 for now even i miss the train for 1k. Been holding XLM for 3 months and even with the pull back - it has still been amazing for me. My only regret is not buying more in early November (benefit of hindsight escapes me). I'm going to load up much more at a much higher price, because this coin has been neglected for a while now. Very steady Stellar, Very steady  We already had a few good days in a row, the engine of the rocket needs a day to be filled  I love BCN. Cant wait for a more efficient wallet. Then BCN can really start progressing in actually useage. oh an a binance listing would be nice too  what's a bit worrying to me, is the many people who got in around 1200, shit their pants now and may cash out once it gets back there. probably going to be a tough resistance around 1300 to break once we get back there. Blood sweat and tears we will stick through this for many years Crypto is real similar to life when shit is up theres nothing or no one that can retract your good mood but when shits down you start to see people for who they really are and you start to see there true colors. Its like everyone starts losing their mind but In times like this when were up we should be hodling tighter than ever before because I have a feeling were about to break a dollar and since we havent broke that milestone yet we dont know whats on the other side of it. So everyone get your mind right because anything can happen at any given moment if hoping we break a dollar this weekend though.  Tomorrow will be an important day since the first BTC CME futures expire. If BTC goes up IOTA will also go up. If BTC goes down, IOTA will also go down but so will all other coins. Do not get scared or panic when it should drop further. There are still huge partners on board like Fujitsu, Bosch, Volkswagen. Once the first real use case for IOTA will be announced (maybe in 26 days at Bosch IoT Conference) probably more exchanges will add IOTA and we may expect a nice boost back to higher levels (and that may be an understatement looking at the surge when Microsoft was thought to become official partner so just think about when real use cases come in to the world...)Good luck to all of you LTC is surging very high in Koinex exchange in India since 6 P.M.. but I have not seen the same surge in any other exchanges so far, guys any idea? If we can't be ahead of xrp in price right now, I will enjoy xlm being ahead of xrp in btc volume! We're getting some love! What do you think about feature of burst? Is it possible to up to for example 5 dollars course? At the moment I've bought 10k Bursts  Right, this crypto slump / depression shizzle can end RIGHT NOW, topped up my Iota at 2.36 and my EOS buy order got filled at 11.6 using the last fiat I'm prepared to use. So it can fucking end now. Go up  BTC has crashed in January for the last 3 years.Maybe those with big gains skip a tax year by holding off on selling til the new yearWhatever the reason it has always rebounded to new highs.Some day we will decouple from Bitcoin but for now we follow the leader I'm also waiting on Bittrex for my Ignis!!On Jan 15 Bittrex told Ignis community on Twitter that they could take about two weeks to set up the market.Pay attention to Ignis community, Bittrex and Jelurida on Twitter for any updates. There are thousands of us waiting.(Oh, and expect an IGNIS price drop; many will sell to make up for losses during the airdrop.) I don't know whether to hodl or sell my Ignis :/ I have a quick question about the RMT transfer at the end of the month into our wallets .....I noticed on Stellerterm, it doesn't have RMT on the asset acceptance section , any idea how to add it or will it auto send to the wallet even though RMT doesn't show on the asset acceptance?

Я хочу посмотреть чем эти ребята занимались раньше In the year 2017 so many Altcoin came into limelight . ETC, WAVE, STRATIS, DASH, ONION and many more Altcoin gained remarkable value. Let us guess Best Altcoins for year 2018? I may be wrong but seem so obvious $bcn will reach $1 in 2018 with all the things planned for the next months. Hard fork and #BCN CARD & EXCHANGE will be a bomb! #bytecoin will never be this cheap again. 3 months old interview with michael stollaire (was member of verge developers and now has his new titanium blockchain project). Good reading about verge and its competitors monero and zcash. Who might win in the future.https://medium.com/@TBIS/the-argument-against-proof-of-stake-pos-by-michael-stollaire-d88502f418be Hey guys according to me we need to promote and support SiaCoin... as it is having a great technology and Development team... but due to lack of their advertisement strategy SiaCoin is lagging behind. What a beautiful concept , we must admire it... it might solve the storage flaws and provide us a secure affordable storage facility.
Right now it is consolidating in the current upper range. Bullish? We shall see. Don't read idiots who predict 40 point drops or rises. They are likely part of these fruitless pump and dump groups. Ask them for charts and they don't respond. The market is skittish right now swinging 10 dollars up and down. The bias is if the go signal is given it will explode. I would suggest to hold your ground and if it drops a bit don't worry or add to your position. The drop can only go to 192 points to 0. The up can go to 1000ish and everything in between. Personally I am happy with everything now chart wise. I completely ignore assinine fud posts even ones claiming or looking legitimate. Fun and games. To get in the android platform and ios have to wait until next year april on 2018 I can not wait to waitOh...  Hope the price will grow...slow but sure...I have a lot of this coin...keep hold for a years,and you will get rewarded... How many days does it take for a litecoin sent with zero fees to bounce back to original wallet or get approved? Now that Russia wants to regulate ICOs, hat is waves future? Considering that waves advantage was ease of issuing tokens. Get ready for February of 2018Accept Litecoin, store and spend Litecoin securely, or turn Litecoin into dollars with the LitePay Card.https://www.litepay.us/Can be huge increase i have discovered that support (albeit for my own stupidity) on the stellar network is almost non existent. what the fuck?i got a message from stellar that we dont have support but fill in this form. thats pretty fucking poor for a multi billion dollar company. It the rare coin with serious dev team and long term project plan who did not yet make 20X dump ! its the good time to buy before the rush. Is anyone else having problems with communication from Utrust? I'm still waiting for my ICO tokens but it's been radio silence since new year. In the dashboard it says my tokens have been successfully sent but my wallet (transaction hash is an error) never received it. People told me buy buy .. price go to moon , right now price go to earth.. is normalize price is good .i told I start buy when price go to 20 -24$ i buy 3128 etc hmm remember used your brain, no suggestions post . OK guys, been watching this whole crypto market since Oct and one thing is clear at this point - all coins are tied to Bitcoin, if Bitcoin farts all alts shit themselves across the board, does not matter how good is the coin that you hold or how revolutionary it is - as soon as soon as BTC goes down alts are down... The whole market is build around BTC, we think we are holding different coins, but in fact it's like everyone is holding BTC, so can anyone logically explain to me what's the point of investing in different coins when at the end of the day it all comes down to a shitcoin like BTC? Don't worry guys. Everything is ok as it should be. Soon, Coinbase and GDAX will start to trade BTC / BCH pair. As soon as it will happen, BCH should go to 300$ where it should be.Minute of silence for those who sold BCH at 4000$ .. You're lucky! So, I'm sure some of people gone from Bytecoin BCN. They did it wrong. I'm not scared or panic about BCN recently situation but look into the future. Look what is happening today with BCN ecosystem. Marketing is going to be really good: Bytecoin Foundation, huge community and step-to-step next exchanges that will add BCN to their system. Developers WORK really hard to make this FIRST cryptonote DADDY coin really useful, modern and unique. If you want to see everyday growin 30% then I tell you: this is not path what are you looking for.BCN can only be bigger and stronger with community, developers, news and upgrades. This things show coin's strength. hib8.com and bibox.com are the exchanges where bitclave is currently traded. Both are chinese exchanges, aahhhh I still have to wait for big exchanges like poloniex, hitbtc or bitrex before I trade my tokens. Hopefullly soon! I'm so jacked right now. If I waited just a few days I could be buying up all this cheap ass XLM or other coins. This is heaven for anyone that has play money.

Anyone else having trouble getting to the website? Yeah, at this point I have lost all hope of ever getting my ~2.12 BTC back. This is pretty standard social engineering, the hosting company screwed up big time. They gave someone root access with apparently no real validation. If you are sending to P2SH addresses then your initial transaction works just like normal. The usual size, fees and dust limits apply. This is because the P2SH addresses are just regular addresses other than the fact they are a hash of a script instead of the hash of a public key.Where things can get trickier is in redeeming any of those outputs in subsequent transactions. As stated earlier, the redemption script for a 7-of-11 might be too large. Still no response to my PM's either. I would really like that refund... This is likely a false positive, I imagine someone is having a laugh by loading virus signatures into the blockchain after reading this thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=554738.0Also of note, this type of post should go to the Technical Support board, not Dev.

FYI, JSON-RPC PHP is a terrible path to point new users/devs down. It uses fopen fopen() and will throw an exception saying "Unable to connect" if it receives a 404 or 500 error from bitcoind, instead of showing the error bitcoind was trying to give you. I've reworked my library to make more sense and fixed some major bugs. Namely, I wasn't handling things well if cURL ran into an issue.Errors are now properly handled if cURL runs into a problem (e.g. can't resolve hostname)Methods now always return false when they don't work.HTTP status codes are available in $this->statusHuman readable error messages are available in $this->errorFull response is available in $this->responseRaw response (JSON) is available in $this->raw_response Do you have the curl extension installed?

I could really use the cash, just had to pay a rather large vet bill (just to learn we couldn't do anything to save him ). The jsonRPCClient library uses fopen() and will throw an exception saying "Unable to connect" if it receives a 404 or 500 error from bitcoind. This prevents you from being able to see error messages generated by bitcoind (as they are sent with status 404 or 500).I wrote a replacement for jsonRPCClient specifically for Bitcoin, if you run into any issues with it let me know:https://github.com/aceat64/EasyBitcoin-PHP Refund received, thanks to JohnK for making sure we didn't get screwed.

Excellent news! Hopefully John can get our individual refunds sorted and processed soon. JohnK isn't the problem, he's done everything in his power to contact Avalon for the refund. The problem is primarily Avalon's lack of a response. Nothing I have said (anywhere at anytime) about this group buy is confidential, so I have no problems with the form/data being public. 260 chips, I'll take the refund.If it doesn't go through I guess I'll make a bunch of K1s and try to sell them or give them as gifts.Edit to add: I'm also accepting offers to purchase my chips (and the refund rights should it happen). Refund received! I feel a lot less stressed now. No refund for me yet, order #44xx   Day 56, no refunds in sight. It seems like there is fairly strong support behind ryepdx taking over the group buy. He seems to be very communicative, as long as John K has the appropriate identifying information for ryepdx I would be ok with him taking over this group buy. I have 260 chips on the line.Optionally, if John K can get ahold of Avalon to change the address I could also handle the order. I have resources readily available for shipping a large number of packages at a reasonable cost.As for trust, my name is Andrew LeCody and I'm the President of the Dallas Makerspace. So now you know how to track me down.  It has been just under a month since I submitted a refund request via their ticketing system (I also used the google docs form). No updates on the ticket and my order is still "refund processing".I hope they finish processing it soon, I've got plans for those bitcoins. I was likely one of the first, if not the first to order. I had my order in within seconds of the store opening. I'm #44xx and also at "refunded" status, but nothing in my wallet yet. Yes. As long as the coins for those transactions have matured. I believe the issue now is that some of the payout includes bitcoins that are so new they aren't treated as "real" yet, since they need to have 120 confirmations first. An administrator will have to fix this issue. It appears that the map is trying to pull some content via HTTP, since the wiki is only available via HTTPS the content is blocked by most browsers.Here is the relevant error from Chrome:Someone with access to the PHP code for this plugin will need to change any mentions of http://maps.google.com to https://maps.google.com for the map to work.Edit: I have mentioned the issue in #bitcoin-dev on Freenode, we'll see if anyone runs with it.

Rex, my balance is only 0.00297025 but I would like to donate to help with the MtRed payouts. Please feel free to zero out my account (it's under my same username).It was an awesome service while it lasted, thank you. I think they've done a good job explaining that what you are proposing is outright theft. Since the beginning we have told people, as long as you hold the private keys your bitcoins are safe. Your proposal would make that a lie. When I dropped out of the bitcoin community in 2010, I still had some bitcoins left in my wallet. I expected that when/if I returned, my coins would be there. When I came back, they were there, if they were gone I would assume they had been stolen.Telling people something is their property and then taking it away later, is theft. If you think this is a good idea (it isn't) why not just use Freicoin? I've added the new bindaddr patch to my client. Not at the moment, I can't think of a way to do that at the moment. Yes, there's the backupwallet RPC method, but phpMyBitcoin wouldn't have access to the filesystem on the remote servers so it can't grab the backup. Maybe if someone adds an RPC method that sends the full wallet as a file. I've created a patch that disables receiving of IP transactions by default. They can be enabled with the "-allowiptransactions" option or "allowiptransactions=true" in the bitcoin.conf file.Here's the patch:http://github.com/aceat64/bitcoin-patchwork/blob/svn/patches/disable_ip_transactions.patchI've already incorporated the patch into my custom client: http://github.com/aceat64/bitcoin-patchwork Sorry, I guess I wasn't very clear in the original post. I would like for receiving of transactions by IP to be disabled by default. That is correct, but my main concern was being able to connect to the JSON-RPC interface from somewhere other than localhost. Specifically so that I could manage my nodes with phpMyBitcoin. I've now removed jgarzik's patch from my client in favor of using Satoshi's -rpcallowip setting (since it's in the vanilla svn). Sending transactions to IP addresses should be removed or at least disabled by default.As has been stated by many members of the community, it is in no way secure. I also believe that it may actually allow an attacker to determine the identify of an operator of a bitcoin node. Example, I send 0.01 BTC to various IPs on the network and record the IP and bitcoin address (a bitcoin address is autogenerated). If I run or have access to the information at one of the Bitcoin exchanges (or run a store/service that accepts bitcoins) I can then tie that IP address to the user of that site/service. In the case of an exchange I could tie that IP to a person's PayPal or bank account!Another possible attack is to connect to a target node and initiate an IP transaction. The target will generate a new address, at which point you disconnect and start again. This might be useful as a denial of service attack. Yup, I've removed my patch, as jgarzik's is better (mine was just a simple hack). If I could figure out how to get it to compile under Ubuntu 10.04 I would throw some BTC your way.   Lzsaver, you are violating puddinpop's copyright at least when you distribute the modified binary. I suggest that you (or a moderator) remove the link to the cracked binary.Edit: Just to be clear, I don't think anyone should use a closed source Bitcoin client and I would really like GPU generation to be open source. So I will put my money where my mouth is, I will donate 1,000 BTC to whoever releases the source for a GPU (CUDA or OpenCL) client that is cross-platform once the code has been vetted by people smarter then me. Macho, the GPL license doesn't stop anyone from making a closed source client. It just requires them to write it from scratch (or be dishonest and use Bitcoin code). I've tried to compile it under Ubuntu 64bit, but have run into issues with it. I would greatly appreciate it if you could give me some info about compiling for CUDA or a link to such information. Thank you jgarzik. The patch is working great, and I've sent the 200 BTC to the address in your signature. If someone wrote a patch that lets me set the IP/port for JSON-RPC in bitcoin.conf, I'll send them 200 BTC.   That's not really helpful to anyone, a more productive use of your time is to work on an opensource CUDA/OpenCL client. Assuming you have the required programming expertise, which I don't. Nelisky, thank you for your work. I think that it's in the network's best interest that the fastest possible methods of generating blocks are freely available (see tcatm's 4-way SSE2). I have no issues with public logging.
As long as you are able to make at least one connection to one good node then things are fine. As the other have said, don't use PeerBlock or anything like that. I know that a lot of people use blocking software like that to "protect" them when downloading torrents, but the fact of the matter is that the RIAA/MPAA/BSA/etc just grab the list of peers from the tracker and send DMCAs to their ISPs. It doesn't matter what you run, if you download a torrent, your IP is on that list for everyone to see. I'm glad to hear that someone is working on this. My only question is what SSL certificate/key is used, and can we specify which cert/key?Edit: I should have looked closer at your code, it clearly references a pem file. Sorry about the confusion, I need to work on the documentation. If you are connecting to a Bitcoin node on the same server you'll need to use "localhost" for the hostname and "8332" for the port. The URI field is only used in conjunction with the relay.php script. The username and password will be the same ones you set in your bitcoin.conf file. Here's an example bitcoin.conf:Code:rpcuser=USERNAME_HERErpcpassword=PASSWORD_HERE You'll be prompted to create a login during the installation process. Here are some screenshots of phpMyBitcoin: phpMyBitcoin is a web-based administration tool for managing bitcoin nodes, released under the GNU Affero GPL. The project is hosted on Github, at:http://github.com/aceat64/phpMyBitcoinDownloadsphpMyBitcoin 0.2beta tar.gz: http://github.com/aceat64/phpMyBitcoin/tarball/v0.2betaphpMyBitcoin 0.2beta zip: http://github.com/aceat64/phpMyBitcoin/zipball/v0.2betaQuick Install1. Download the entire project, unzip/untar it and upload to your server2. Create a MySQL database and user3. Open install.php in your browser4. Put in your MySQL information5. Create the first user6. Add nodesBitcoin ConfigurationIn order to take full advantage of phpMyBitcoin you will need to run a Bitcoin client that supports the listgenerated and listtransactions methods, and you must be able to connect to the node's JSON-RPC interface.I've created a custom version of Bitcoin that includes patches for listgenerated, listtransactions and binds the JSON-RPC interface to all IPs instead of just the loopback. You can find the source code here:http://github.com/aceat64/bitcoin-patchworkI also have pre-compiled binaries for Linux available:http://github.com/aceat64/bitcoin-patchwork/downloadsUsing The Vanilla Bitcoin ClientIf you would like to use phpMyBitcoin but don't want to compile or use a modified client, you will need to use a relay of some kind so that phpMyBitcoin can access the JSON-RPC interface.Please note: Unless you have compiled your Linux kernel with IP_NF_NAT_LOCAL you will not be able to use iptables to redirect requests to the loopback interface.If the remote server you are running Bitcoin on has a webserver with PHP capabilites you can use the relay.php script (found in the scripts folder) to relay connections to the loopback interface. Setup is very simpile, just drop the relay.php script somewhere accessible from the internet. When adding the node to phpMyBitcoin if your relay.php script is accessible at "http://somesite.com/relay.php" your settings will be:Code:Hostname: somesite.comPort: 80URI: relay.phpLicenseThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Then you can access the JSON-RPC interface over HTTPS, the relay simply passes commands it receives to the Bitcoin server on the loopback interface. In the repo I have a folder called "patches" where I keep a copy of all the patches I apply. I'm now doing binary releases with my github repo: http://github.com/aceat64/bitcoin-patchworkI've got the following patches included:Jgarzik's listtransactions patch: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=611.20Jgarzik's getblock patch: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=724.0The listgenerated method, lifted from Lachesis's now deprecated RPC Calls patch: http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/I've also made the following changes:Slight change so that JSON-RPC returns 200 instead of a 500 error with invalid methods/params.Slight change so that JSON-RPC binds to all/any IPs instead of just the loopback.Changed MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS from 8 to 32. You guys are making the same mistake we did when working on this in the IRC chat. The system I outlined would work for distributed generating and allow you to determine how fast each of the nodes are generating hashes, allowing you to pay out based on how much work each user is putting into the pool. That's probably just the usual weekend bump. I agree with creighto, I think at most the client should give a notification that there is a new version available, but I don't like the idea of auto-updating. No one is working on them because it's not really necessary to write a new protocol for a lightweight client. Adding encryption to the JSON-RPC interface should be enough to allow a full featured but still lightweight client. It's possible right now to setup a simple PHP script that acts as a relay between the JSON-RPC service and a client connecting to your webserver using SSL. I'm up for a conference, or maybe for now having a booth/seminar at another conference. Oops, I forgot that the package is actually named subversion. I'll update the post now. Quoted with permission from me at least, so if need be mizerydearia can edit the post and make it a weird monologue. I wrote up a basic guide on how to compile Bitcoin on Ubuntu. I hope it proves useful to anyone still having issues compiling the graphical client.http://lickthesalt.com/2010/08/19/compiling-bitcoin-on-ubuntu-10-04-karmic/ About a week ago in IRC we had a discussion about how to do this, I believe mycroftiv is looking into implementing this kind of system.It would be your basic client-server setup, the server sends each client a set of data to hash and a starting nonce. The data of course being the block header. The client would generate hashes as quickly as possible looking for a winner, but in order to keep the server informed about how fast it is working (so the BTC can be distributed by CPU-time) the client would create a hash of every 1,000 hashes and send these "meta-hashes" to the server. The server can randomly chose a meta-hash to check, it would then run the same 1,000 hashes and see if they generate the same meta-hash. If the meta-hashes don't match, then the client is lying. You don't have to worry about the clients stealing the winning block because the proxy transaction is already signed over to an address that only the server owns. I am not aware of any other cryptocurrencies that got beyond the planning stages. Under such a system, a bad chain (such as the one we fixed yesterday) would get locked in if it lasted more then 10 hours. I'm sorry, but automatic checkpoints are a bad idea.
You guys seem to be forgetting that the generated bitcoins can not be spent until the block has matured to 120 confirmations (120 blocks built on it). No honest nodes will accept your transaction if you try to send coins that haven't matured.The likelihood of chain splitting for that long is fairly low, and even then once the longer chain wins the only losers are those who generated bitcoins on the shorter chain. While it sucks to be the guy that generates a block then loses the reward, those "lost" bitcoins are an exceedingly small portion of the total number of bitcoins in existence. All transactions from the shorter chain will be reincorporated into the longer one. 1) The point of Bitcoin is to be a global currency, it doesn't make sense to use Bitcoin as a replacement for a national currency2) Block chain checkpoints are already done at each release of the client software3) To generate a longer chain from scratch doesn't require more power (CPU time) then the network currently has, it requires more power then the network has put into the chain since the start. The current chain has had unbelievable amounts of CPU time go into generating it. I would love to see a bitcoin module for WHMCS. I've updated the page with your suggestions, I've also added footnotes to explain some of the fields. I created a wiki page so we can keep track of the results: http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=4-way_sse2 For now I have stopped generating on my nodes. Have you tried pairing it with another node with no block chain to see if you can generate "block #2"? Running a business that provides services for bitcoins is also more profitable then generating blocks for transaction fees. I fail to see why this is an issue. It's a web-based panel to manager your bitcoind nodes (assuming you can connect to the JSON-RPC server of the node). Hopefully it will eventually be on par with the GUI. The current version is read-only and only really works with modified clients that have Lachesis's/jgarzik's RPC Calls patch. From what I understand a node will not include transactions in it's blocks unless the transaction includes a fee that meets the node's requirements. So in the case of a node setting the fee to 1,000 it would likely never include any transactions in blocks it generates, which means it will miss out on any transaction fees other nodes would have gotten. There really isn't a reason to set a nodes requirements higher then the rest of the network since you are basically just pricing yourself out of the market. I'm the one working on phpmybitcoin. In case it's decided that the name is too similar to mybitcoin.com I've registered the domain phpbitadmin.org and will rename the project to phpbitadmin as a fall back. How would an attacker connect to both sides during this split in order to spend the coins? And if the attacker can do it, the likelihood that one or more honest nodes could bridge the divide is pretty good. ArtForz actually made a patch to check up on BitcoinMiner(), http://pastebin.com/YGUcqPYK Awesome work mizerydearia. Do you plan on making most of these scripts open source? If I ever do make that "Bitcoin Command Center" I wouldn't want to be pounding on your server 24/7.   It really is fine for now, if it becomes an issue future clients will have a lower fee (if any). If you choose not to pay the fee the only thing that happens is that nodes who charge that much will not include your transaction in their blocks. Really, only one node needs to have that fee removed and sub-0.01 transaction will go through, although you'd have to wait until that system generates a block. So those super-small transactions would sit at 0/unconfirmed for a while, but once it got into a block every block after that would count toward it's confirmations. I just tried again with the latest version from your github. I'm still seeing a drop in performance compared to the vanilla source.My system went from ~7100 to ~4200.This particular system has dual Intel Xeon Quad-Core CPUs (E5335) @ 2.00GHz. I like Olipro's suggestion is this thread: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=645.0The buyer and seller both an equal amount of bitcoins into escrow and the seller can't retrieve both sets until the buyer signs off on it. Optionally if both parties agree the funds are returned to their original owners or both sets are transfered to an agreed upon arbitrator. I deviate from his suggestion that the arbitrator only have control over the buyers half, I think they should have control of both so that both parties still have a bitcoin stake in the issue. Perhaps we could work in a way to do arbitration. If both the buyer and seller agree, the money can be diverted to a 3rd party. That person could then arbitrate and either return the money to the buyer, give it to seller or steal it (obviously you'd want to choose a trustworthy arbitrator). If I was to quadruple knightmb's bandwidth numbers that's about 40 kbps, which is actually pretty low for a server. I'll convert one of my nodes over to a "super-node" and try it out. In the end, it's still basically pointless data for 99.9% of users, since you still have no way of knowing who sent a transaction to you (unless you generate a receiving address just for them).
Another issue I noticed with bitcoind's JSON-RPC is that by default there is no user, and PHP's fopen() function does not try to send the authentication information if no user was specified.For example, this URL does not work:But this one does:I had to set the "rpcuser" in my node's bitcoin.conf file in order to get PHP to play nicely. Jgarzik has a patch that displays the existing extended-help descriptions: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=637.0Pastebin.ca is down so the actual patch is on his website: http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/patch.bitcoin-help-extended It's recorded in the block chain. I should also mention that it may not be just one address per transaction either. If I were to send 500 BTC it might actually show up from multiple source addresses. The client doesn't know who sent a transaction, it only knows what bitcoin address sent a transaction. Unless you know all of the potential addresses of your donors, how does it help you to know which bitcoin address sent the transaction? For instance, say you had an address in your signature and I sent you 5 BTC. Unless I told you I sent you 5 BTC at X time, or I gave you the address I sent it from, how do you know that I was the one who sent it? I noticed the same, I went from about 4300 to 2100 when I tested it on Linux. Gavinandresen has one, but it is not currently up to date with the svn (r119).http://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/tree/svn Now that the JSON-RPC server is secured by a username and password (although not encrypted), I would really like the option of being able to bind bitcoind to another IP and/or port. For example, I have a handful of nodes that all have a public interface and a local interface. I would like to be able to bind bitcoind to an IP on my internal interface so that I can monitor and manage the node from one server. Great job satoshi! Some of my nodes have seen >100% increase in block generation speed, not to mention it was MUCH easier to compile bitcoind. I've updated the code in my original post. I'm bumping this thread on the off chance someone would care to use my updated Nagios plugin. If we kept the test relatively short I don't mind throwing on a few EC2 instances on the test network to help out. Update: Cleaned up the code once yore pointed me to the json_decode() function. Also removed unnecessary rounding code.Update 07/27/2010: Cleaned up the code a bit more, fixed the perfdata so it outputs in a sane format, and added rpcpassword optionUpdate 07/30/2010: The script has been redesigned so that it no longer requires the bitcoind binary, since it makes the JSON-RPC call directly. In order to get the current hashrate this plugin assumes you are running lachesis's getinfo patch. You can find the patch here: http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/Yes, it uses PHP but it works.Latest as of 7/30/2010: http://pastebin.com/9iRSJWMrOld, deprecated script: http://pastebin.com/ShDr80G2If you find this code useful, I accept donations at: 18jFGqFR53fEtaDg1DvRy1vWid9M2EVW1V   There is a central authority, but I don't see that as being an issue since all we're talking about is bootstrapping. Unfortunately every bootstrap method I can think of includes some form of central authority. How about a system similar to pool.ntp.org? Basically we have an opt-in list of nodes of very stable nodes and those IPs are added to a round-robin DNS record. Optionally, we could have an automated maintenance script that updates the DNS record at set intervals to remove IPs that are no longer accessible. I feel that this system would be preferable to hard-coding IPs into the client. This method should allow fast and easy bootstrapping using a proven system (DNS). The difficulty for generating a block has gone up, it's currently at 181 when it was as low as 23 a few weeks ago. Check out this page for help in calculating your probability of generating a block:http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.phpKeep in mind that block generation is a lottery, each hash you compute is a "ticket", so the faster you generate hashes the more chances you have to win the lottery. For instance, I have a desktop at home that can do about 1600 khash, I ran bitcoin for 3 hours and generated a block, however my desktop at work has been running bitcoin for days with no blocks generated. Civil forfeiture is unconstitutional and yet it happens everyday. I know of someone who was charged with a crime and had his phone and some cash stolen by the police. They claimed the phone and cash were ill-gotten gains, even though the phone was bought by the person's mother and she had a receipt as proof! In the end, the charges were dropped before going to court but the city still kept the property because he had to sue to get it back which would have cost more then the phone+cash.For more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_forfeiture#United_States Once the connection is restored it is likely that the larger network has a longer block chain, so that would be considered the official chain. All of the transactions made on the smaller chain would revert to 0/unconfirmed and eventually be reincorporated to the block chain. At least that's how I understand it. I think the lower case "b" in a circle is perfect since bytes use a capital "B" (i.e. 23 MB) and bits use a lowercase "b" (1024 Mbps). So the lowercase "b" would be the "bit" and the circle would be a coin.   It looks like the deposits have to be approved manually. I checked today and mine had gone through, I promptly blew it all on bitdime slots. I have a slightly-used Kel-Tec Sub-2000 rifle. It is chambered in 9mm and accepts Glock-style magazines. I bought the rifle brand new and have fired about 200 rounds through it. The rifle has been kept in great condition is like new. It will come with 1x 10 round Glock magazine and 2x 16 round KCI magazines. Also included is a pouch that can hold 2 magazines. If you are interested, please PM me for details.You must meet ALL of the following requirements in order to purchase this firearm:1) You must be a resident of the state of Texas (Unless you are willing to pay more and find a federally licensed dealer in your area who will accept the transfer).2) You must be at least 18 years old.3) You must be able to legally own firearms. For example, you can not be a convicted Felon or have been adjudicated as mentally defective.I reserve the right to refuse sale to any individual who I suspect does not meet one or more of the legal requirements for transferring this firearm. The sender pays the fee, so you would send out 10,005 BTC and the recipient gets 10,000. There's an article on this in the wiki:http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=transaction_fee
