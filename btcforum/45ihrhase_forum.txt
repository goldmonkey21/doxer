I might just as well say something here...Not going to quote people...OP:Primarily your argument works out if you are not in tune with historical fact as opposed to the slop the public education system pours into people's heads.Space: The US government threatened to level Brazil as it was actually approaching attaining orbit before the US and the Soviets were, they dismantled their project.The ability of private enterprise to be involved in space without government in the US was thwarted when Kennedy made it a military task, furthermore the US government stopped (violently) three other attempts since the 70's for private interests to begin space tourism.Not to mention the treaty the US was eagerly a part of, signed by Johnson to make it illegal by international law for anyone (individual, business or government) to own anything beyond the atmosphere.Internet: Have you seen what the government did as far as internet was concerned?  If it was not for private commercial interests the internet would still be a barren network of text based messages.It is never that it is some conspiracy, it is the natural effect of power when granted to humans, just because you know a guy and you think he is a good guy does not lend that government is a good idea or even the best of the worst ideas people can come up with.  When you give people power the incentive is to preserve and grow that power, history is a testimony to this fact.  Besides if your friend is in an elected office outside of some small district where everyone knows everyone else, I am going to say it is unlikely he is a good guy, as these types of people would not make the empty promises needed to attain elected office.The guy who thinks libertarianism =/= anarchismMr. Libertarian, he is also known as Dr. Murray N. Rothbard.Not all people who call themselves libertarians are anarchists, but then again not all people who are libertarians are actually libertarians as well (Wayne Allen Root and Bob Barr for pertinent examples), a logically consistent libertarian realizes he is an anarchist.And the gentleman who brought up the Liberty Dollar case is absolutely correct, I think you guys do a great disservice to a bitcoin using community by not accepting the reality that government is VERY HOSTILE to competition with a function it decided it would have and no one else should (research Spooner and the Post Office).  Bernard von Nothaus was indited terrorism charges for minting silver and gold, no one here is special and potentially safe in any means, if you are adverse to breaking decrees by government it may be wise for you to forget this, it is already illegal for you to be Human (See Controlled Substances Act then research DMT). The people claiming to be Austrians that denounce any currency over another are not Austrians at all, they are people introduced into economics by Ron Paul, who has no interest in discussing Austrian theory of money, only the Austrian theory of government and money...Gold is a terrific way to control the government spending, as they only have a limited resource...As for economy as a whole, even paper currency is not "unworkable" so long as there is a competition, the problem with government money is fiat legislation and credit expansion... So their unlimited service is $9.99 a mo (correct?)That would equate to:$9.99 * 146.22 BTC/$1458.54 BTC/mo.Unless there are people local to me that wish to purchase my consumer goods for BTC the marginal use of BTC does not exceed $ for me yet.... Is there a human volume to your market, do you have population numbers as of right now DW? It would be infinitely more so If I could find the BTC Rate.... I maintain my assertion.... Danny,The only point where it won't matter would be after the state has ended....We may never see this day... The problem is inherently, as I have stated elsewhere the less morally reprehensible the act the harder the state cracks down...The state went to war on American civilians on two occasions less than 20 years ago, over alleged (unproven to this day) tax discrepancies totaling less than $250 combined.  In both cases the state fired first, and then proceeded to execute with extreme prejudice.  We do not see this type of action taken against drug cartels, prostitution rings or any other illicit activities, just ones that the average person would not generally look on as such a bad thing.  The state then used media to propagandize the situations to some monstrous proportions, the first was based on a racial issue that did not exist, and the other was claims of religious sexual practices that did not exist...In effect they legitimized state aggression based on people's emotive decisions on non-illegal actions, not that these non-illegal action existed at all...The strength of this is the decentralized nature, there is no one place to attack that will destroy us all... The US Government has made a position, you should be aware of it...and your exchange seems to be down...on a side note...Price has nothing to do with cost Suggester, maybe you should not wave the economic ignorance finger at anyone else before you keep it from being pointed at yourself...If price does not equal cost do you not sell your product at a loss in order to recoup capital and try a new venture?  Maybe you will suggest hoarding your product from the market, because if no one wants it they might after you tell them they cannot have it...The fact is price is subjective, if the market will not support the price at cost the market is not wrong, the entrepreneur is wrong, he had employed his capital incorrectly, and that is the end of that story... http://www.auctionbytes.com/cab/abu/y210/m03/abu0258/s03IRS to Track Online Sellers' Payment Transactions Beginning Next YearBy Barbara Weltman(Darth Sidious Voice)I... am... afraid... your friends at Paypal will bow to the state.We may, in the next year or two, have to think about NOT exchanging to dollars anymore There is one, at least, participant in this forum that is concerned with hoarding of BC, please allow me to explain why this is not an issue, not because it will not have negative effects if it does, but more likely it will not occur.What we must keep in mind is there is yet a coherent value model for BC, when I first got here many were assuming cost equals value, which simply is not true, I have said it time and time again, value is not based on cost, but rather on the demand for a commodity, right now there is little to no demand for BC.  There may be in the future, but that is speculative and is related to a few factors which relate to the general utility of BC as a medium of exchange.BC as a commodity has no value without a commodity that may be exchanged for BC, there is no other use for BC than a medium of exchange.  Commodities with an inherent value have an ordinal utility within themselves, that is, they have an industrial, commercial or consumer use, you cannot compare BC to land capital, other capital or commercial goods because of this fact.The other way a commodity can retain value is through government fiat, that is legal tender laws, basically by the forced use of particular monies, these monies retain their utility because other options are illegal and the basic coercive threat maintains their usage.BC does not fall within either group of commodity, its value is determined by its ability to out-compete its substitutes, it must therefore be used as a medium of exchange for goods in order to have a value.Hoarding is deleterious to the ability of BC to out-compete its substitutes, as it will raise relative prices in BC and the exchange rate to other currencies, while other currencies will not be incurring the same price explosion.  As opposed to legal tenders, there being no government fiat coercing utility people will abandon BC if the substitutes are more beneficial.  In the end, the hoarder who keeps BC as an investment in the future value of BC gambles with his money.  If he does not use them, sell them or lend them to someone who will use them at interest and just pulls them from the market the lacking availability of BC will diminish the value as there is no other use than as a medium of exchange.  The increase in price, $ purchasing value, coupled with a stable commodity price structure, of BC will be an indicator to the wily entrepreneur that something is wrong, and these people will stop using BC first.  This will start a chain reaction that will give the illusion of the desired result in the "stock" market numbers, the same boom in $ value of BC without corresponding increase in production available to be traded in BC is a business cycle bubble.  If the hoarder at this point does not cash out immediately, which is relatively difficult, he will be holding BC in the bust, and therefore lose out.This is also leaving out the whole world of whether it is more profitable to a "hoarder" to lend his BC at interest to producers, invest in productive business himself as a shareholder or to use them in the market for consumer goods than it is to just sit on anonymous internet blips that have no value inherent to themselves...Lending at interestI know there are people who like to boo and hiss usury, but it is a natural market phenomenon based on  production, charging above the natural interest rate is a side effect of time preference, get over the communist propaganda please.If I were to be a hoarder, let us say I have control of 60% of all BC, and have no intention to use them, why would I not lend them at interest?  If there is a market demand for BC, and I have BC, it makes no sense that I would not take advantage of the market demand, it is like saying that a producer has no impetus to sell his products, when he can just sit on them indefinitely.  Why does the stereo manufacturer sell stereos?  If he produces $1000 stereos, by the hoarding logic, holding them instead of selling them will make him wealthier and increase the value of his stereos this is not the case for stereos, nor BC.No, lending is more practical than holding BC in the hopes for increased value.  Predatory interest rates will be curtailed by the free nature of the market, as anyone can lend BC so long as they have a surplus of BC beyond their usage, there will be large amounts of competition in this field, which will lower lending interest rates.InvestmentIf I am holding 60% of all BC, why does in not make sense to invest in businesses?  If I believe that there is a good business, even if they are not looking for shareholders, why would I not want to attempt to purchase a minority share of that business and receive a dividend based on their profits?  In the long run, I would benefit more buy purchasing 1% of a business than not at all, not only because of the real gains in BC over time, but because the value of BC will increase when there is more products available in BC, there will be more demand for the very bitcoins in my coffers, a net gain at the natural interest rate.SpendingIs the argument that I will sit upon my digital throne, resting atop my digital blips?  Would I be enjoying some superiority because I am wealthier in BC than others?  If this image is just silly to you, well you are correct, if you still at this point believe hoarding is a good idea, this is exactly what you are claiming.  If I have 60% of all BC, what is the point, how do I benefit from my majority stock of BC if I do not acquire consumer goods with them, or sell them to people who will?The hoarding mentality can only be directed at BC that is not being used, which at this stage of BC can be all of us who hold any, as there is not very much that can be bought through BC.  However as the BC marketplace fills with goods and services, we will see a decrease in nominal prices and an increase in the BC/$ ratio.  This will only occur if people are spending BC, if they are holding them businesses will not accept BC when they can accept any other media of exchange.If BC's value is based on exchanging them for goods, how exactly is the hoarder protecting his BC's value if he does not allow them to be exchanged?  Any way you slice it, exchanging BC for goods and services is how BC has value, hoarding them negates this and therefore negates the purpose of hoarding...I am sorry to say to the developers of BC that this may not be the finished product, they may go through many trials before a viable economy is derived from a counter-economic currency, we should persevere to make this one work, but keep in mind it is a learning experience and it may fail... So long as the illusory value is propagated, but what you state but ignore, is there is a commodity exchange that occurs...We need the businesses which deal in Bitcoin before you can have a coherent value system for bitcoin... 1. how does bitcoins illegitimate application hamper its use in legitimate application, last I checked most criminal transactions are made in current fiat currencies, and yet they still seem usable in legitimate functions today...2. Claiming that an exchanger should cater to where they are most likely needed is not focusing on criminal activity, it is making good business decisions...3. You guys are judging Yes but why would they, unlike precious metal specie, bitcoin has no use other than a medium of exchange....but there is nothing to exchange... I am not quoting...1. You make many assumptionsBitcoin as a fixed money will not have a fixed value, and this is not what a static economy is in the first place, a static economy is one where there is production, but it is the same in every given period.  So, either you assume that at some point there will be a time that there is no more products able to be added to bitcoins exchange-ability and the volume will be the same always there after.If everyone consumes all they earn and they choose to take a loan in order to consume more or invest in a business, why is it any concern if they cannot pay, that is between the borrower and lender, if I were a lender, I would remain appraised of who does not pay, and not lend to them...2. Your exampleIt ignores that bad business models ought to be met with failure, the emotive argument that someone will starve is utter crap as well.  The owner of Bitcoin will not have to issue more bitcoins, as people can opt to use other media of exchange, the worst that will happen is that the value of bitcoin will diminish, which skips ahead to another point....You are also mixing what we are doing with a government, they are two separate and completely different scenarios...3. Since there is no legislation forcing people to use Bitcoin and only bitcoin, if someone hoards bitcoin it makes the commodity of bitcoin less useful as a medium of exchange, and people will abandon it, this will decrease the value of bitcoin because it has NO OTHER USE other than a medium of exchange...As for the Dollars in foreign hands...It is inflation that caused that issue, and did nothing to preserve the value of the dollar, it was the coercive laws to use FRN's that retained the utility of the dollar, nothing retains it's value, it is why what cost a dollar 70 years ago costs much more now, even with our growth in the US economically, we could not hide the inflation of the dollar...4. And lets take your lending your friend $100 and make it BC...You lend your friend 100 BC and he buys 100 kg of potatoes, since there are no more BC being made, and in the course of the year more products are available in BC the value of BC increases.  When you receive your payment on your 0 interest loan and find that you can buy 110 kg of potatoes what is your position?Did you break some moral code, because you did just reap a 10% interest?How do you explain that this managed to happen without inflation?Are you morally required to return to your friend 10 BC or 10kg of Potato?Interest naturally occurs, it is caused by time preference, that is, people prefer goods now to the future, and there is a real gain, interest, when one goes in the business of trading goods now for goods in the future...5. Without government to protect the monopoly, nothing stops others from getting into the business that the monopoly is in, and cutting the market share of the monopoly.  If you claim that people who have a monopoly would incur the costs of securing it through coercive means, well then you do not understand that this costs money and therefore is an unsustainable business model.  Much like Americans that think going to war across the globe is a good idea, they do not understand there is a price tag on this behavior, mainly because they are not paying it directly...6. What you are forgetting about the money commodity is without legislation making it the only one, it is a substitutable commodity, there are many commodities that can be used for money, and as such it has a very elastic demand curve.  This means that supply has almost no bearing on the value of the bitcoin commodity, because people can freely move to another that can completely replace bitcoin for themselves, the value is based on demand, and that demand is based on commodity exchanges available to bitcoin... Nice math....But why would someone buy your bitcoins? Really now?  Do you know why people used gold as money?  How about unbacked paper?Trust is not built by corresponding blips on the internet, it is built by being able to use regularly and gain an expected result...If no one can purchase anything but $ with bitcoins then bitcoin is nothing more than a gamble on anticipating other people's expectations on the utility of bitcoin.IF one can only purchase consumer goods OR capital goods with bitcoin, an exchange is necessary to fuel the economy with transaction material, for example:If I sell widgets and I accept bitcoin for them, if I cannot buy widget supplies to generate widgets in bitcoin, I will require an exchange for the purpose of attaining the capital goods necessary to resupply my production cycle.  Conversely, if I can buy my capital goods in bitcoin, but no one will buy my consumer good in bitcoin, I will require an exchange to resupply, using bitcoin.  However if both transactions are taking place using the bitcoin medium of exchange, I may only need an exchange if there are not enough goods to exchange my profits in a (subjectively) worthwhile manner...Is it that you and another exchange collude that give bitcoin value, or is it that I can expect to use bitcoin in exchange for goods?  If an exchange rate is stable from one exchange to the next, it builds trust that the exchanges are legit, but does nothing to secure a value to bitcoin. I have to agree with Hatter...necessary, no, but with the limited commodity base for bitcoin exchanges it may be helpful to get people involved... 1. Hogwash, it does not matter how many bitcoins I have in relation to anyone else, I can lend them if I value the future bitcoins over the present ones...2. StrawmanLike I said to suggester, hoarding devalues the medium, and inherently destroys the whole point of hoarding...And what you are not understanding about my points is that interest happens regardless of inflation...I am an anarchist.... I could tell you where the state can kiss....  But I am sure you know...I would suggest the lecture series about American economic History "The End of Laissez Faire: 1870 to WWII".  Monopolies do not exist without state coercion to protect the monopoly status, if entry is free for all, if regulation by a state is non existent, how exactly do you propose a monopoly to exist in the essence that it does the "monopoly thing" (Cut production and raise price) and not lose market shares to new competition...American History proves this example... The value of a money is what one can expect to gain in exchange for said money....I am not worried about people dumping BC's on your exchange, I am saying any value is arbitrary until people come to accept BC as a medium of exchange...
I have to agree with MH, on his post from the other thread, BC will not have a real value until people are trading in BC, if you attempt to value it by trade from BC to $ and vice versa, all someone has to do to completely destroy your market is dump all BC for $.If the BC marketplace cannot provide real world goods and services for BC, then it will be doomed to failure...Some people are stuck on the idea that BC is valued at the expense for generating BC's...BUT...The problem is that if there is no commodity available that people want, one cannot expect to see people pay $ for BC, regardless of the cost one incurs in generating them...It is like saying I spent $X on creating Salmon and Sauerkraut Smoothies, so people should buy it for $X, but since no one wants Salmon and Sauerkraut Smoothies, no one will buy them, most likely they will not take them for free.   Except that inflation requires someone to add to the currency, this is irrelevant to the market's existence, just the the money's standing in the market...Interest on loans do not require inflation, they require accumulation of wealth, if there is 100 dollars in the world and I have 10, and I give you 10 as a loan with the condition that I will receive 11 back in the future, both of us knowing that there is only 100 total dollars, there is no way you can pay me back plus interest in dollars without accumulating wealth and trading it for others dollars.Your Strawman presumes one person holds all the money, if such is the case, I know it is impossible to be paid interest in dollars...If I acquire all bitcoins ever produced (21M), and lend some to you, I know full well it is impossible for you to pay interest in bitcoins, because I cannot inflate, nor presumably anyone else, beyond the stated cap in the FAQ.  I would therefore logically look for something else of value to assign as an interest payment...This of course is leaving out the logical issues of the nature of value of an exchange medium that is not being used in exchange...The arbitrary nature of your argument parallels the government's arbitrary nature of deciding what is or is not illegal...Who decides what is unfair?  Market distortion in reality requires a state mandate, since this is outside the state mandate field, that should be a non issue...Well you lied in your example, in relation to free market logic, you have earned, through courier-ship and inherent risk of your act a 10% profit from your friends, if you stated from the get go that you charged a $10 fee for the service then they had the opportunity to decide to use you or go about the risk themselves, you would be more honest.How would any business make any profit if they sold all products for strict cost? He is a minorityI am talking about the ones on the books compared to the way the government interprets ones on the books... Take it from someone who has done things he was not legally prohibited from doing, but someone from the Ivory Tower did not like it....It is not a good scene... Remember NLSThere are two types of law...The Law you can read, and the one the government chooses to apply to you...Your Lawyer friends may be right, but so were joe stack's and he got prosecuted... Interest is a market phenomenon, it is an application of time in economics, so I will have to disagree with your dishonest connotation to interest...Basically if it is your opinion that the purchase or sale of drugs is "dishonest" then do not engage in such practices...Take a less offensive example, tobacco is legal to own and grow privately in the US, but it is illegal to sell, trade or gift home grown tobacco.If I were to sell tobacco I grew at my home, using bitcoin as a medium of exchange, am I using it dishonestly?The use of bitcoin as a medium of exchange is illegal in the first place, why are you concerned that individuals will use it in order to trade contraband, when the medium of exchange itself holds the same legal status as a pound of marijuana?Nice to meet you then   NLS...Pros...Free market interactionTax shelterCons...It is illegalIf you are planning on using Bitcoin as a business you should realize that there is an inherent illicit nature to the practice of using, trading, and even promoting a currency that is not issued by the state, the state has a monopoly on currency for a reason, anything that threatens it will be playing a game with the coercive resources of the state.Bitcoin provides supreme opportunities to its users, to see how a free market can work, to see that governments are not exactly good at mitigating the moral hazard of fiat currency, where a private generator may be better and when government is taken out of the equation, prices are drastically different.This is as illegal as us forming a mint, and pressing silver into coins to spend in a market that operates outside the tax structure, inherently all operations using bitcoin are "Black Market", with this in mind, if illegality is an issue for an individual, cashing out now might be the best option...Fergalish:The difference is the banks have the coercive power of the state to protect their actions, with bitcoin, as it is an inherently illegal operation, there is no power to force people to interact with dishonest users, the dishonest types you seem to be pointing out, would shy away from a market that do not have a coercible market advantage...Suggester:Market exchanges need to take place for a market equilibrium to be reached, there will be a correction as more exchanges are possible, therefore utility is increased, but these are nominal...NLS:A "Fiat" currency is not bad because it is not a commodity currency, it is bad because of a state monopoly, if you have 5 competing fiat currencies there is more of a tendency for honest currency, this is because the dishonest ones will be deselected out of the market.  Similarly if you have a single commodity currency in the hands of the state, and this is a historical fact, the state manipulates composition if the commodity currency...On criminal activity...What criminal activity?What property right violation would use bitcoin to hide itself from the state?  Seems inconvenient to me as a step to avoid detection...If you are thinking trading state mandated contraband is criminal activity, well, then so is bitcoin, as FRN are the only state mandated currency in the US, all others are contraband... NLS, there is no "legal" way to do what you are looking to do on a large scale, knowledge is not necessary for indictment...You are providing a tax shelter, you should automatically factor in illicit to your "hobby" Works for me... BTW New liberty, what is the site you do your exchanges at...I would like to look..... A competing currency? It does if there is a crash from inflated prices, slow steady inflation is what we have now, in an attempt to stabilize the prices (failing)There is a logical inconsistency, can you tell someone that you wish to sell BTC's to, "this costs me $1 to create this, so give me a dollar for it"?  The cost of production has no bearing on the price system in BTC, only the products attainable by it has such.  What your slow stream if inflation does is stabilize prices if more products over time are available in exchange for BTC, however, if they do not increase your price system increases the prices, AKA devalues the currency, and as this is different than government currency, you cannot compel usage, would it not be more beneficial to have an increasing value currency and declining prices in relation to BTC?You sort of answered this in the second, without an exchange of goods that has a measurable value, how do you determine the value of the BTC itself?1 your answer has nothing to do with the question, the finite cap on available BTC is how the current system deals with inflation2 the cost of generating a bitcoin has nothing to do with the price one demands for a commodity in BTC, if I would rather have 1 BTC than x amount of commodity, regardless of the cost of generating that 1 BTC, and the cost of attaining that commodity, no exchange will take place.Economic lawFor a transaction to take place both parties MUST perceive a benefitThe price system is how prices will be determined in the market, if you are proposing that dedicating 4 years time should give equal opportunity to someone dedicating one year, you are devaluing the bitcoin for the long time users...3 Well if you are concerned with trade in BTC, why are you not concerned with production in BTC?If the BTC level is capped at 21 million, and there are no more BTC to be made your options are to go into business and sell something for BTC or buy them from someone who has them that sells things for BTC, it is obviously in the interest of producers, without the addition of BTC to the market to sell their BTC off or trade them for capital goods.Why is price deflation bad?Monetary deflation would be bad, but we are talking about, as I am lead to believe, there will be a constant amount of BTC after a time, where none will be added or leave the system.  Monetary deflation will not occur, just a decrease in nominal price, which is an indication that the value of the BTC is increasing, a good thing...maybe you all should look into the philosophy of free market economics, since that is what we are realistically doing...Off the top of my head...I think the stabilization of the amount of BTC is crucial to the integrity of the unitI think that we should stress market trade instead of concerning about the cost of BTC productionI think that IF megabots or whatever decide to dominate the market for generating coins their business will be short lived and only serve to be an exchange service after a timeThe fact is that IF there was a hoarder, watching nominal prices would indicate such, and it would be silly for someone to do so, the most they could to is exchange them for $ and then their dominant market share is compromised Pretty... As far as this end of the technology is concerned I am not sure how that all works out...Can you explain: 1 How yours solves the issue of inflation?2 How yours can calculate a meaningful price system?3 Outside of a commodities market, how does yours have a meaningful value for the BTC? If the overall plan is not to build a counter economy you would be correct, but I think people involved here are looking to, in the long run at least, do more than trade valueless digital blips...If it does not increase in utility it will not increase in value...The value to these digital blips is NOT in how they are created but in what one can get for them...Subjective Theory of Value and BitcoinI have a list of products I would like to attain for my bitcoins, these are capital goods, that is for use in production of a consumer good.  When I attain these goods, the value of the bitcoin is in relation to how much of these factors can be attained with each coin.  You can assert that 1 BTC = $1, but if I can obtain more capital goods with $1 than 1 BTC, then the $1 is valued higher to me than the 1 BTC.  The logical choice for me is to then dump all BTC for dollars in order to obtain capital goods, and therefore sell my consumer good in dollars....*side note* When I bring my consumer good to the market, how much the market clearing price for my supply is will determine whether I am using the resources efficiently, or if I should rethink my business model.*What you guys are talking about is Labor Theory of Value, this theory was shot to pieces in the late 1800's, I do not think I need to repeat the process...The invest-able nature of the BTC will disappear if there is no commodity market that supports it, it is why the dollar has stayed afloat, well that and military might...I Agree, but you are thinking that a planned economy is a sustainable system, look at the world of economy and tell me how well that is working, the free market can handle all your issues, it is something we are not seeing today, so the comparative advantage in logic is based on the unused system.  It was the less planned economy (more laissez faire), that accumulated the major part of the world's monetary gold in the US prior to WWI.  There was less regulation and taxation inflating prices, BTC mimics this, as it is a counter economy currency, if it retains the capped amount of BTC, it will be able to stabilize in the long run...Keynes thought this too, are you going to have a privilege class that gets new BTC to spend to solve your problem too?Yes they have a value, that consistently depreciates over time, it retains utility by government coercion, if you had the choice to abandon a depreciating fiat currency for a stable commodity based one, why would you allow inflation to rob you perpetually?...  This is an unsustainable modelThere is not infinite milk or corn, and they are not currency, they are commoditiesThere is not infinite electricity eitherFinite supply is what this world is about, resources are scarce...So are you looking for some perceived fair share before a more efficient producer comes along?  I am sorry, but IF someone chooses to dedicate more resources to production of BTC, they deserve more BTC.Except those that are looking to use something that will get them out from under the current failing economic models, which as far as I can tell is not your issue...People that see no value in anonymous transactions will abandon BTC, I am certain, but I think there are more people looking to not pay for every government misadventure through inflation and taxation...Not Quite, it is infinite, just at a planned progression on the way to it.  It still interferes with the market value of the BTC...I disagree, it needs a trade base, that will prove the currency, without the trade base it is as useful as $$ in an MMORPG, sure people do dedicate real $ for MMORPG $$, but in the end there is no production...Only in your rendition of how BTC should be, there is no way to propagandize me a communist...Why should the early comers not have the advantage?  They are taking the risks initially, for something that could go nowhere, the later comers, after the system is proven have considerably less risk and if they dedicate less to generation they have less to lose. No you are missing the whole point, no exchange = NO VALUE, and therefore no point in hoarding, it is the common fallacy seen in marxist, so I do not blame you, you just have to realize marxism is wrong before you can think coherently in regard to this argument.  You are completely disregarding ALL economic laws in regard to your analysis, once you try to benefit from hoarding Marginal Utility destroys the potential gain, you completely ignore time, and this is why you think hoarding may be beneficial...The model has nothing to do with this, it is the utility the producers of capital goods have that will rectify this.And this would be why Communism is not a good idea either... Are you one of those inevitability of government people?  I am sorry but there is no regulation on BTC and it is nontaxable as it stands now, it is operating without government, do you assume that government should be involved? Yep...Most likely, once they start seeing a real decline in tax receipts, it will be a combination of the two...Precisely Madhatter...NLS, If I may...Infinite BTC production will cause the same issues we have today, inflationary bubbles and then busts, this will deter people from using BTC as they will already have the same service with government mandated Fiat, and no risk of penalty for using that...If you were a fan of the free market you would believe everyone, including yourself, is better off when they have equal potential for gain...You are forgetting the point that BTC only has any real value in trade, so the people generating the coins will have to trade them in order to maintain their value.  If I hoard 20 million BTC, the Value of the other Million will decline as utility will not support BTC, I do not think it will need to come to that with the precariously small number of coins.  Hoarding will be seen, by economic tells, within a 10% share hoard.  I will tell you right now, there is "hoarding" because of the small amount of available business in BTC, I am, but my "hoarding" is waiting for products I want, there is little utility as of yet in BTC for me, though I am willing to do business in BTC.  I do not have a tremendous amount of power dedicated to BTC production, I am a minor player at best, but I offer a product none will be able to attain with BTC as of what I have seen, does this give me an unfair trade advantage?  No, anyone can enter the market against me and compete freely, as with any other Black Market, the advantage to competition here is we are not about to shoot each other over trade.The democratic governments is what is wrong with the current monetary system which inspired this creation, maybe we should stop considering them as good.  They violate human rights as a constant activity, they murder on wholesale levels, the rob entire populations, they enslave humans, all without any threat of punishment...I would suggest if you have time looking up the lecture series "The End of Laissez Faire: 1870 to WWII" by Murray Rothbard.  It does well to prove with historical accuracy, Business + Government = Corporatism, and this is NOT conducive to free market... To clarify I know what you meant, it is not the paper aspect that makes FRN's unstable, it is the unlimited printing of them that does...The reason the gold standard was superior to non gold standard money was because there was a maximum amount of money printable...imagine there are 100 BTC...When there are 1000 BTN in circulation they can be exchanged for .1 BTC per BTNIf creation of BTN is unlimited this exchange is then unstable (always decreasing as more notes are made)If you lock finite the amount of BTC's and more people use them in exchange, each BTC will purchase more, as the store value of the BTC will increase.The way the stepped generation of BTC seems to be explained in the FAQ, it will attempt to keep pricing stable as BTC are generated, but overall the prices will drop once BTC production ceases and utility still increases.  This is a good thing, eventually equilibrium will be hit, let the market do it...Offering uncapped note production is in reality doing what governments do with a money supply, that is, they add notes with nothing to back them up, and if we use the value of the BTC, infinite printing will yield the same issue the USD  has with its former commodity value store (gold), almost a century ago FRN's hit the market, and gold was $20/oz, in the 70's we dropped the standard completely and gold was $35/oz, now gold is over $1000/oz regularly (and this is only due to Congress' meddling with the figures)...We have an excellent opportunity here, to show government is not necessary, or even desirable in the market, that honest free market alternatives are not only viable, but are also desirable...Maybe I am insane for wanting a world where market prices are free, and not padded by regulation, taxation, rife with price controls or subject to the desires of the few whom victimize the many, but I am happy with this insanity...  Mine are real goods... Thnx  65.33.97.204 192.168.1.12  Aside from a minor outage due to weather, it will be up 24/7...
