I'm not against automation, don't get me wrong, but the ultimate utility of automation and machinery is to serve humans somehow. We wouldn't be polluting the planet and crave for power sources just for fun.What is interesting atm, is to discuss possible flaws and exploits, trim and cook the idea, eventually even weight it's pros and cons against other concurrent systems that may show up. But discussing about hypothetical software... What would be the point?And death of someone is not to be taken lighten; the deceased could well blow his money on women and cars instead of save anything, but if he chose another path and his soul must have some way to rest in peace about the loved ones he left behind. So we must add some romantic and human vector to the whole system. Taken must of us, if not all, use strong passwords and/or strong security systems, way too complex sometimes, figure a way to open it when needed is far from an easy task or, like the widow of the Canadian exchange owner, crypto ends locked for good, practically dying with the owner.Thank you for your offer.  Now your trust party is a batalion of people?Let's put things a bit straight here; there're two opposite PoV in inheritances, the PoV of the heirs, who probably want the money ASAP, but that's their problem, and the person who actually gathered the wealth and eventually deceased. My system is towards the PoV of the former, not heirs, a more personal and human way to provide a last will, not some random characters and an automatic email with a weird key of sorts, which could land in some spam box.If you have a better idea: develop and present it. But it turns kind of annoying to keep reading "I would send emails", "I would go with smart contracts", "I would use multi sig", "I would... whatever" -> Great! Do it!A valid idea and valid discussion about this issue is on how to trim its usage, like AGD addressed and posed the issue.Technology has the sole purpose of serving "rotting flesh", without humans all of Bitcoin, all of the electronic junk we created, would be rendered plain useless and worthless. So, what if your trusted third party get acquainted with one of the interested parties? Guess what... you'll "die early" and someone will be sharing your wealth while you entertain yourself finding a lawyer and engage the funny and long civil court processing.To not mention that would be a plain money-grab... @VodHow is that any easier?!  Those are good questions indeed.The informatics part is quite straight forward, it's just encrypt, encrypt, encrypt.The human part however isn't that easy, and I believe there's no "one-size fits all" solution for it and my system isn't fail proof.If one of the addressees dies shortly after you, the best shot would be to resource his closest relative (wife, husband, sons...). We have "layers of communication", there are things we say to family, but not to friends or strangers, others maybe to friends but not even to family.For the custody, you could use a testament lawyer office, or you can intruct one of the addressees (preferentially not the #1) or a third party you trust, or you can leave it in a vault with a note on what to do next.Yes, it's possible, however the other 2 already gave their answers, so they're already triggered by what's going on and would probably chase down or sue that last one. EDIT:One of the cases that inspired me to do this: https://www.newser.com/story/270824/crypto-investors-woe-widow-cant-open-founders-laptop.html If one party dies before you do, don't forget to redo your system. As no, there's no way to skip or create partial solvers.About forgetting, they've all the tries they want to remember, will take them longer to solve.The encryption system works like peeling an onion; each layer of encrypted text just uncovers the next layer of encrypted text. @OgNasty Yes, you can call it a sort of "Encryption for Dummies", it is intended for the easiest usage possible assuming one or several of the target parties couldn't be tech savvy.IDK any already in place system for this purpose of "e-Testaments". As for memory loss, you will probably also forget you'd any crypto assets, so the custodian part can show up and tell you about your system and those you need to summon to help you out on regain access.There's a lot of human side to this system, creating a good Q&A set is one of them.@STTYou can combine it with a dead man's switch for sending the said email (but don't forget email services die as well, imagine you'd an @cjb.net; wouldn't be of much use now), just sending the msg.js (where the encrypted final text resides) and the other two files, the HTML and CryptoJS.js, as attachment.But this shouldn't obviously be the "only option" or the "only path", just "another option" or "another way". Not trying to sell anything, it's GPL licensed, and it doesn't send any email or communicate anywhere at all. But probably can be handy for lawyer offices that offers testament's custody services. Still don't see your point... it's like "hey, don't use RIPEMD160, use MD5 instead" or something alike. There's no technical advantage whatsoever in your solution, to the least both solutions can achieve the same, being your more unnecessarily complicated, unless space is a constraint (which isn't much these days, with regular entry levels USB pens to be up to several Gb).I believe you're more thinking of the informatics part than the human part of the question. The human part requires that:1. An human solvable and reasonably easy way to pose the questions (your heirs might not be nerds).2. No previous advice of the existence of the system by the heirs (they might get greedy... we never know).3. Enforce a way for all parties to cooperate, no threshold of partial parties (a few of them may conspirate to leave others out of the scene).4. Personalize your message; it's your TESTAMENT, not some random hashed characters.5. Also you might want those you love to remind you one last time, instead of doing a simple cash grab. By posing questions of your co-existence, you can be sure that will happen.But you're free to present your system. Like at RAR, ACE, 7Z, ZIP and other compressing algorithmics, you don't see one of them to come over to say the other must do as he does, do you?Still your system of Xor'ing the hashes with the question doesn't pose much difference than AES'ing it. But that would provide a way they might solve the questions individually and not as a group, forwarding their hashes through lawyers or so, unlike the intended way of this solution that forces them to be together or take a very long time by proxying it through representatives. @BitcoinFXI know that now. Sorry for just overlooked the Wired article.In a way, I didn't dig deep because, if I know who Satoshi is, the only thing I would give him was a hug (well, with Covid around maybe a virtual hug). From my PoV, and knowing what happened to Liberty Dollar creator, if he wants to remain anonymous, it's his right. I will not try to find who he is.Obviously will not validate any idiot that washes up claiming to be him, an idiot that doesn't even know how to use an earlier, known to be owned by Satoshi, private key to sign something. Nope, I didn't know it was. Still the same guy behind it since day 1 it was registered, over 10 years ago.Also first Bitcoin casino owner.  And coming back to show a small project I made for people's heirs, made me go on a nostalgia rampage. Like Dwdollar's first Bitcoin Exchange, bitcoinmarket.com (launched by 1st February 2011) @nutildahWell, compared to the next snapshot one year later, he was tampering with dates at his blog:https://web.archive.org/web/20151003011245/http://gse-compliance.blogspot.com.au/2009_01_04_archive.htmlThe January 8th 2009 post wasn't there in 2014. So we can assume the blog entries timestamp and content was just as fake as his claims.@odolvlobo yes, it's irrelevant indeed.So, sorry to think he was around longer. Sure.It proves nothing about him being or not Satoshi, but checks out, Satoshi never used this domain, at least using his main account.His former blog shows him to speak about Bitcoin by 2009, a few days after Genesis Block:http://web.archive.org/web/20140602022810/http://gse-compliance.blogspot.com.au/2009_01_04_archive.htmlBut the only captures from Archive.org date from 2014. Could he put up an entire fake blog to second his story? Idk!@nutildahHe (CW) didn't wrote that, Satoshi did. And yes, other than the domain change the text is exactly the same at both former and current Forum. @nutildah,That may actually check out. This forums wasn't originally under "bitcointalk.org" but "bitcoin.org/smf". The change happened by 2011 and Satoshi (the real one) isn't around since December 2010.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3;sa=showPosts;start=0And if he just lost 14 BTC, then it wasn't much. I lost 15 not at MtGox but due to the hack, I'd some change at mybitcoin.com under the same password as MtGox (I'd a big fight with Jed and lost confidence in his service way before he even sold it to MagicalTux).I remember also was M'Tux always giving "lectures about password security", and turns out we found after the hack it was single round MD5 hashes... WTG!    Trying to not commit the same mistake as Gavin, but he seamed to have a good insight of our early community (my ID here is 217). Maybe he's just a good liar and studied it over to sound credible. Thus his lawyer keeping talk about "Mount Gox", either he didn't told him or it's a flaw on his lying, but MtG stand for "Magic the Gathering" (Online eXchange), Jed's business before use it to trade crypto and later sold the site to M'Tux (later we came to know it was Karpeles), anyone from such time knows it, it was public here at the Forum and the number of topics were quite low.Without doubt however, he isn't Satoshi or related. Old news reborn? That's from 2016.Here's to sum up what we know about CW:- He's an early adopter, no doubts about it.- He lost a lot of BTC with MtGox hack.- He seams to had some business going on and due to his lost he needed a way to gain some time over his creditors. So he came up waving "Satoshi's fortune".- This Faketoshi thing got out of hand and he keeps living his persona up to this day.Gavin was initially lured, just that. Shamir's system, which is pair to multi-sign, doesn't requires all parties to cooperate, also requires the parties to know before hand what they're holding and its use.This system doesn't require to inform anyone or you can inform a third unrelated party (custodian) of its existence to summon the needed parties when it becomes needed.  Solves the problem when you want your assets to be accessed only by cooperation of a set of people (if you've more than one heir that is).Isn't any "traces wipe out system" as a dead man's switch, it's the opposite, it's to provide your heirs access to what's normally encrypted. One thing that bothers everyone that has cryptoassets is on how to leave them once we die or if some accident happens that leaves us unable to respond. This can be handy too if we suffer from memory loss.So I came up with this idea, a set of questions posed to several people, where each answer is the key to another AES encrypted layer.Let's say you want to put your questions to Paul, Sue and John in a set of 3 questions each. The system will start by asking Paul one question, then Sue, then John, then Paul again, Sue, John, Paul, Sue, John. There's no way one can answer his 3 questions without the other two answer their questions too. Paul won't be able to see his questions if Sue and John doesn't answer first, nor Sue if John and Paul don't answer in between, and won't even be able to know what questions are those...The system is purely JS and HTML. And I'm sorry if it's a bit sketchy, just got this idea a couple of days ago.Code:WHAT IT DOES?This system encrypts a message under several layers of AES encryption. The ideia is that you be able to leave a message in case of your death or any accident that leaves you unable to respond that can be opened only by a group of persons you know by answering a set of questions you made.TIPS:The system has two vectors, informatics and human. The informatics vector is covered under a well known strong encryption algorithm (Advanced Encryption Standard), in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding.For the human vector, you should select well the persons and the questions, try to not be too obvious, like "what's your favorite color?", or provide questions whose answers could be easily guess by other participants.Try to be personal, ask things those persons wouldn't tell anyone over any casual chat, and things that you know only you and that person could possibly know, like "When we first met?", "Where we first kiss/make love?", etc.You can also use a third party you trust, and unrelated to the question targets, to keep the message safe.In combination, if you want to leave many data, you can strongly encrypt a True/VeroCrypt partition or file container and leave its password as message here.This system REQUIRES NO INTERNET CONNECTION. For safety you should do it OFFLINE.INSTRUCTIONS:Open the Maker module (maker.html) with your browser (the system was made and tested using Firefox 83.0 for 64 bit Linux) and fill the form, some fields are dynamical and will appear only after other actions are done.You must set:- A welcome message, that will display in the header of the Viewer Module.- A message to encrypt- A final question and its answer (will be used as password to AES encrypt the message itself)- The number of people you want to be answering your questions, and their names.- The number of questions to pose each of those persons.Once done, press the Generate Code button, it will provide you a file to download named msg.js - download it to the same folder of the "Viewer Module".To use it:Open the Message.html file, once the msg.js is in that same folder, at the Viewer module and start to roll the questions.THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE USED:CryptoJS v3.1.2jQuery v3.5.1Download link: https://www.asw.pt/EES.zip Try Bisq, that's impossible to ban anywhere.
This is just a curiosity, which may mean something or nothing, but have you noticed the pantograph movement in the 1 year range?It appears that Bitcoin is moving down on the same fashion it went up last year on the same date, as if a group made 1 year investment and is now leaving (at high loss): That you call "liberal media" has nothing to do with "liberalism", is just "liberalism", once again, taken the blame for being abused.Any liberal would let you do whatever you want, do things your way, as long as it doesn't collide with others' rights or harm anyone.In the last 30 years liberals made it possible for gays to not be locked in mental facilities, to not be harmed over a simple paraphilia, but now things are getting out of hand, it's like you give a finger they take an arm.Someone opens a gay only bar: modern! fashion! amazing!Someone opens a straight only bar: homophobic! call the police to close it! get a bunch of useful idiots to riot in front of it! (see the liberalism here? This is "unliberal liberalism" at its best)You already have men competing on women sports, it doesn't matter how many hormones you took, a man disguised as woman is still a man, a man with severe mental issues, but still a man, you can't change his bone density.This hurts women rights and throws them out of society."Oh, but trans are women" - says an idiot... Right, so trans men can win at women physical sports, trans women have no chance at men sports. So long for your equality, isn't it?There was a time, on Ancient Greece and Rome, where gayness was widely accepted, we don't exactly know why society turned to highly homophobic - we blame religion, but for people to adhere to religion and empowers it, something must be at their minds -, but it did. First, mental disorders aren't genders and that "science" is a mix of philosophy, politics and nothing. Yes, people have differences, each and everyone, but still gender is binary, like it or not.I used gays for the example because they're probably the biggest oddity trying to get their way down society's throat at the moment, but not the only. This abuse is leading traditional Liberals out of the scene and opening space to "unliberals" pseudo-liberals (those who need "safe spaces" and act in a way that you MUST do what they want or else) and fascists (other than safe spaces pretty much the same shit as their counterparts).As liberals throw the towel, another team will emerge also to join the band wagon, Islam, and snowflakes will come to a time when all they can do is cry for arrest this and that and the whole world for hate speech or whatever, but nobody will hear them anyway. Tolerance is the pillar of a liberal society, but it has been lately being abused, putting in danger this very same pillar.Let's start to understand that tolerate doesn't mean to like something, tolerate means to allow others to do things their way even if you don't like it.A fair example of this abuse lately are the so called "gay rights". WTF are "gay rights"?! I take a c*** up the a** so I want special rights for it?! Get real! What's next? A special parking lot for gay people? A gay soccer league? oh! Wait!...Oddities can be tolerated, you and your boyfriend like to dress like women and chase each other around the house? Great... do it! But don't force the society to play along. And no you're not "gender fluid" or any other idiotic thing, you're just a guy or a girl, regardless. Deal with it!So to a point, this issue - and many - are no longer on the tolerance realm, instead they're trying to shove oddities down society throat and demand society to like it instead of tolerate it.This puts a danger on liberalism, as more and more people starts to react to be getting oddities shoved down their throat and when it turns around liberalism will be taken the blame. Competition and cooperation are complementary and needed; you cooperate with your team and compete with the other teams, by competition your team have a reason to achieve more and better.In sum, cooperation is needed, but competition is the fuel of invention and effort. Don't fall into snowflake ideologies.All derivatives of communism are flawed, just by reading common people comments on Facebook... I really don't think that direct democracy or stateless communism are good ideas, probably you would end up with death penalty for nothing and everything down that road...@coin8coin8 ; I'm not looking for fascism to implement it, but to give it a strict definition.Lousy definitions provides a lot of misunderstanding. Currently the "trend keyword" is populism, because most people doesn't know what this word means, all you see is a lot of populist politicians talking against populism. You're moving towards nowhere in defense of Communism, Communism is considered by all means an Utopia - never worked and, most likely, never will.At the same time you seam to be having some difficulties on understand the reasons, not an insult.Just your ideal system doesn't work, sorry for that.When you say something like "but your system also have leaders", assuming you know my political position. Yes it does, but my system doesn't aim to make everyone equal.Likewise, you can be far right and a speculator, but not far left and a speculator. It's about coherence. You keep confusing your personal belief with political sides...  All Communism States will end in Fascism, Fascism is a consequence of Communism (even Mussolini was a Communist leader before). Now I'm short in time, but if you read the Economy Socialist Class it explains why this happen, why Communism brings nothing but famine and why its leaders will either resource Fascism or die. You are a bit slow, aren't you?For your utopia to work your system has to have no leader, otherwise your utopia is flawed as at least one has more rights than the other...It doesn't mean Communism can't have leaders, it means it just doesn't work. Caravans of half naked Swedish girls never happen   By "economic cooperation", you mean "you work I eat and we call it cooperation"...   Yes, that's the more common one.In the 1st one however, 17, 19 and 20 and 10, 13 and 11 are paradoxes.This due to the relative weight of economic to personal freedoms, on the first group you can do whatever you want with your money but you can't do anything without prior state authorization, to the opposite end you can do anything with your personal life but you can't control your money.One is like giving you money to go to Disneyland, but close its gates, the other is like keep Disneyland open but don't let you've money for the entry ticket. Curious compass.What are the X axis based on?Usually they are the economic freedom, but that one sounds a bit of. My real curiosity about Revelation, resumes to know what kind of mushroom did the author took...For the rest, takes to be dumb for believe on a 2000 years old prophecy with 0,00% accuracy so far, all "this is a prophecy of Revelation" was nothing but a far shot. LOVE! Now available in .32 and .38 full and semi automatic modes. Actually that's because as soon as shit hits the fan, left wing (which means nothing) will start to claim that is right wing (which means also nothing).Left wing doesn't see Kim Jong-un as left, nor Maduro.The great advantage of a good for nothing split system is that supporters, specially the extremists, from one side and another won't gather around while enjoying beating each other's.Likewise we get the ultimate chair rotation at the system, Democrats, who had policies that would be considered hard or far right are now "lefties", Republicans went the other way around, and probably 100 years from now people will see them again in the opposite ends... Enjoy the divide to conquer system!  This keeps derailing to off-topic...You became obsessed when I said communism and fascism overlaps on so many ways, that came to defend communism with your "-0 is not 0" meaningless chart and now keep trying to defend your utopia.Even if it's not, per definition, wrong for communism to have leaders, not even they're bad or good, it however means the end for your "egalitarian society" as that one is over the others. All you can use is the "tu quoque" (you too) argument, but what's the point of that argument? I'm not against leadership, but I'm not also talking about "power to the people" then sit a guy over them all and pretend it's indeed "power to the people", am I?Back on topic, here's what I believe (and don't come again with the "fascism has a definition", because it doesn't and this discussion has going around for ages, there's no "Fascist Mein Kampf" describing it), are core parts of Fascism:Totalitarianism and Authoritarianism, obvious pointsCentralization of everything on the State (All with the state, all on the state, nothing out of the state, nothing against the state)Lack of awareness of the limits of law; means the fascist assumes it can legislate about everything on everyone's life, this includes even how he must wipe himself.No space for relativism, everything is absolutely right or wrong, as the law covers or aim to cover everything, no grey area and no safezone to anyone.Unlike Nazism or Communism, Fascism is diffuse, it can bend and twist to fit the context or humor of its dictator - this is due to have no Manifesto or Mein KampfThe other components, such as state police, removal of opponents and so on are already included on Authoritarianism. Here comes again the meaningless chart...  As long as you have a communist leader you've a "primum inter pares", one whose decisions count more than the others... Or none of your utopian communism if you will.As for the other entry, again is "fascism is all bad I can think of", or in other words, a mere insult.  Hitler wasn't elected, his party had a minority winning, which he turned into an absolute winning. But himself, running to President, lost the elections.Mussolini was indeed elected, and looking at Italy today, he would probably win the elections again, at least the elected parties doesn't fall too much apart of him.But this isn't the question, the question is about defining an ideology. Have a specific and strict sense of what we can call Fascism (ideology) or fascism (insult).Democracy has its weaknesses - candidate suppression, vote suppression, plain and old rig and so on - , actually, like sir Winston Churchill, I don't like it, I accept it because I can't think of nothing better. If you put a bunch of burglars voting the only thing they would be voting about will be on ways to rob their victims.I think of Fascism more as the opposition of Liberalism (European Liberalism, not be confused with US flavor), rather than communism. The only way to have communism as you portrait it is by direct democracy, otherwise as long as you've a communist leader, you no longer have any communism, but a red flavor of Fascism. Giant Sequioa for USABamboo Tree for China...they're the most emblematic anyway for both countries. Sorry... don't understand the question.
You entry ends up resuming why Fascism is keen to be just an insult deprived of actual and concise meaning.First of, let's avoid charts. Charts are OK for a glance on comparing BTCUSD pair performance, but when it's to define something they add more noise than anything else.Let me show you how your chart translates on to "Personal Freedom"*Then you continue with an anti-Trump bias, but Trump, as well as Putin, is an elected body, this means the people voted them for be their representatives. This implies that you just consider it to be democratic when it fill in your bias, otherwise are fascists, resuming "the will of the people" to your own will.* - There's no such thing as "collective freedom", the collective is the only constraint of your freedom to start with. In a small scale it can be resumed as when you were single to when you're married, while single you want to go somewhere, you just go (as long as you've the means to get there, obviously), when you aren't you've to try to convince your wife to go or let you go.The wikipedia entry is also public domain... For ages "Fascism" has been used as pure insult, this attitude deprived it from meaning as calling one Fascist or SoB resumes to the same, doesn't exactly means he is indeed a fascist or his mother is a prostitute. Madeleine Albright lately wrote on this subject over the very same concern.What IS Fascism on strict sense?From the little Mussolini left behind him, we can establish that any ideology who wants to centralize full power at the State is a Fascist ideology, but little more can be establish beyond the burden of doubt to be or not fascist behavior or ideology, as we start to collide with other ideologies, such as communism, which, by such narrow definition, are fascists, or even worse extreme fascists, as the state controls absolutely everything on society.So... how can we define and give it a meaning? And because of such you bomb the crap out of civilians?! Because you're not aiming at that said person... If you're looking for money it must be quite sad and pointless.You should be looking for things you need; food, shelter, clothes, tech, etc... and for it you need money. Money for money, unless you're a numismatist, doesn't make much sense... But that depends on technology, not on any change on biology that made women nowadays anything different than what women were for the last thousands of years. A crane can lift 100 tons with the push of a button, a car can run at 300 km/h at a push of a button... the strongest man can't even lift 0.5 ton and the fastest can't run even at 50 km/h.On cognitive grounds there appears to have no much difference.But then again, usually when we listen to "equality crap" we're talking about management... management is 1% or less of the workforce, a factory needs a 1000 workers and 1 manager, not 1000 managers and 1 worker. You don't see many women applying to construction work. Equality is actually the worse thing that can happen to women. You're not giving them anything, you're taking.We can't change biology, women need special attentions men doesn't, therefore a set of jobs were considered as "womanly" to prevent men from push them out of employment and towards a dependency life. So when you start talking about "equality", you're actually giving even more buffer and rights to men.Equality is like as if you make all sports competitions mix-gender now... and we will never see a woman in a podium again! What is an "evil force"? I doubt the "evil force" sees itself that way, usually your side is the "evil force" to them...I recall an old cartoon where a soldier was asking a general why they were fighting the enemy, so the dialog went like this:Soldier: - Why are we fighting them?General: - Because we're right and they are wrong!S: - Then why are they fighting us?G: - Because they think they're right and we're wrong! It depends on many factors, specially taken on your own sensibility and common sense.As it may see as "wrong", the child itself can be using his condition to cause laughing and get social interaction, easing the burden he has to carry no matter what. Being too much of an idiot PC may be worse as it ends up being to ignore and give a cold shoulder. Obviously if the child seams to not be enjoying the way you're playing, stop it... you're being a prick. At wars I found strange to see so many geography-ignorant people talking so high on how they "own some land", despite never even being there or even able to point it in a map... Where's the logic of that?!  And what good can it do?!  The new trend on limit freespeech is "fake news", fast turning into "convenient" news.Like at Malaysia, now they have "anti-fake news" laws... well, it is nothing but yet another way to prevent criticism on Islam and their government. Ironically saying something like "Allah is real" is what should be considered fake news, because you've no way to prove your statement. Sorry to hear that. Be safe out there, pal.  Where?Because rates are falling sharp at places like Japan, rising at Korea... in global terms however they are falling. First a question: Where?Then, other of the given answers, also the "boundaries of what is considered rape" has been enlarging, at some places even tell a girl you find her beautiful can get you accused of rape.Extreme or what was considered as rape in the past; "Legacy rape" if you prefer, doesn't seams to had increase that much world wide. Under it either you're happy or you're dead...   Quem gosta de viver à conta do Estado já viu isso há muito, aliás qualquer coisa é taxada 3/4/5 e mais vezes.Recebes algo -> pagas IRS sobre isso -> pagas IVA sobre o remanescente -> pagas IA, ISP, IMI, etc...

There's just one cause of death: Life.Live as it fits you, life can't be a condemnation where you've to be alive even if you are doing things that gives you no joy at all of living. Adding some deepness to this:1st there's no such thing as "be poor" or "be rich", one either "feels" one way or another. You can find people feeling rich for having food for the week, and another feeling poor because can't buy a new iPhone, despite having food in stock for years.This leads to the relativity of the issue: what is it to you to be poor? Or rich? Yes, it has an impact on the tx size, therefore you'll pay higher fees if you store small amounts through multiple addresses. Each address has an unique private key, those coins are associated to that private key, so each input has to be signed by it.If you've 1 BTC stored through addresses A to J each with 0.1 BTC, when you send 1 BTC to someone it will have 10 inputs -> 1 output, making a much bigger tx in size than if you've 1 BTC at a single address.The concerns of privacy on opposing end is that, if you have too many coins stored at a single address, you will undisclose your whole amount upon a tx.If you've 1000 BTC at a single address and want to send 1 BTC to someone, it will cause 1 tx of 1 input (1000 BTC) and 2 outputs (1 BTC to whoever you're sending + 999 BTC returning to your change address) - ignoring fees on the examples. Your old address will remain attached to your wallet. So you can send how many times you want to that address.It will provide you a new address, but the old ones remain there. Means you can use it for that you want. Also don't forget that each time you send Bitcoins your "change address" also changes, so probably you don't even know it.Let's say you've 5 BTC at address A and want to send 3 BTC to address B.Bitcoin can't split coins off-chain, so it has to send the whole 5 BTC and the thing will go like this:Input from address A of 5 BTC with 2 outputs:3 BTC to address B2 BTC to address C, where address C is another address from your wallet that, depending on your client, you may not know yourself.And then if you send 1 BTC to address D, the process will be:1 input from C of 2 BTC with two outputs:1 BTC to D1 BTC to E, where E is another change address.... and so on, and so on.Despite these change addresses aren't shown to you, your software has the proper private keys. Não é uma visão contrária Pedro.Não estou contra a taxação, estou contra o mediador voluntário que apareceu e a forma como o fez. Não sei se leste o artigo, mas aquilo era na base de "os consumidores exigem", intransigente, a fazer as contas a quanto o erário ganharia ou deixaria de ganhar, não sei se pensam que as Finanças estão com falta de pessoal ou quê.De resto concordo contigo, a taxação seria a legalização tácita da BTC.  Só te posso dizer que temos pontos de vista convergentes.Acho que já disse aqui uma vez que para a maioria aquelas aplicações bancárias com seguro de risco incluído que pagam 0,001% ao ano já são risco demasiado, imagina a Bitcoin! Isto requer nervos de aço, se assim não fosse já tinha desbaratado as minhas precipício abaixo num daqueles dips > 90%. A resposta da DECO à acusação de ter espetado a foice em seara alheia é doutro mundo! Este foi o meu comentário:Em resposta deles:Ora, começa pelo entendimento de uma criança de 5 anos da velha falácia "os impostos beneficiam todos"; isso só é verdade até certo ponto, não estamos na União Soviética nem na Venezuela para andar tudo a tentar viver à conta do Estado, com os resultados que se conhece.Depois o argumento do "onde se incluem os consumidores"; bem, todos somos consumidores na mesma linha em que todos bebemos água (seja directa ou indirectamente), pela mesma linha de argumentos pode-se criar uma associação de defesa dos bebedores de água e a seguir meter o nariz em todo e qualquer assunto sob o pretexto que "também são bebedores de água".Sem falar que o alívio que eles dizem ter recomendado é no IMI, que é um imposto municipal que nada tem a ver com o Estado central, ou na banca que não tem nada a ver com nada, já que é etérea a impostos. I wouldn't say laziness, those people aren't exactly lazy but under bad management.The child/slave labor at Bangladesh who made your clothes can't be called lazy, can it?It depends still on the region we're talking, between tropics life is easy, terrains are fertile, so no much effort is needed. At some point you can blame laziness on these ones, but most just don't work more because they will be robbed if they do. My father was working in an UN program for Mozambique and one farmer told him he wouldn't produce much because of the "evil eye". At first he though he was superstitious, but he came to realize what that means; if they produce too much, an army or paramilitary branch will show up to "collect protection", so keeping the production at "just enough" will get them out of troubles.The whole mess appears to root from the lack of understanding that economy has to be distributed, otherwise you'll be building 10m+ USD luxury houses in the middle of "Favelas" and can't show your face in the street... but greed doesn't let many to clearly see the whole picture nor the "price of their money". There's no such cause, poverty happens naturally. Just sit on your ass and do nothing and it will come to you.Wealth is what requires work and something to cause it, poverty doesn't.It's somewhat awkward that the poorest places are the naturally richer ones, but when the world let you live with minimum effort that's what you do, and by doing as little as possible poverty will find its way.Not really. They still have most of the resources and slaves, actually even more slaves than ever. But it doesn't make any difference when the management is what it is. Yes, it's possible. Unlikely means it still can happen, just like life on earth.However to prove collision one has to have both private keys and those private keys have to be different. If you've just one than most likely your seed is the same used to generate the other, so you got his private key, not a collision.This said, unless you find the owner of those coins and he comes forward with a different private key, there's nothing to see here. Reason why its value isn't the same everywhere. The labor theory is still under the relativity of value umbrella. On utility basis, silver would be way more valuable than gold. Gold is just used for plate (with a tiny micron think layer) exposed contacts, due to its oxide-resistant properties whereas silver is the best conductive bare metal known.Due to its value, gold jewelry is on a nose dive for quite a while now. Too risky to carry around such value on display. You mean you brutte-forced an > 0 address...That's not a collision, that's just what it; brutte-force. If the counterpart doesn't accept gold you get nothing.Gold is just as tradable as Bitcoin and its value derives of supply and demand just like Bitcoin... most of people also does nothing with gold, just stores and holds it as bars in speculative hope of its value to go up.What you're mistaken is physical existence, you're saying that "you can touch it so it has some value". Well... you never touched a single dollar or whatever currency you use, coins and notes are not physical money, they are just physical representations of it, yet you use it. No argue there; fiat has the intrinsic properties of paper: means you can write on it and it burns quite easily. Still most of it is virtual and has no intrinsic anything.However time is an absolute value, you live x years, not x dollars and they aren't correlated. You can take a longer time than me to do something or vice-versa, and this will just means you will earn/create less "value" per hour (or other time frame) than me. How hard it is or not to create also won't define value, the hardest thing to do if has no demand still has no value.On the other hand you're mistaken value with money, money is just one way to express value, an abstract layer to quantify somehow the value, but value itself isn't money. You can choose to provide a service or goods of equal or equivalent "value" without express it on any currency. There you get a paradox: air and water.You can imply it has always some value, so that value is intrinsic. But water and air are vital, and here comes the paradox: water and air aren't charged anywhere.Yes, they are free, practically everywhere. What is charged is the service of treat and bring water to your tap or bottle it, not the content. It would be highly immoral to charge for water because those unable to pay it would simply die.So paradoxically what holds more value, vital value, can't be charged at all. Water itself has no intrinsic value, but the intrinsic property of satisfy thirst. It may worth a million at a desert but nothing during a flood. Not about that, but lately every time a jackboot tries to jump on Bitcoin will always come with that "intrinsic value" thing...   But it remains: There's no intrinsic value! Not on gold, not on livestock, not in a house, nowhere.Intrinsic is something that doesn't rely on any third party to exist and therefore can't be changed by any third party as well.Take the copper conductivity, it 's 58,5x10^6 Siemens, and it is as so now as it was 10.000 years or 1.000.000 years ago and it will remain so 10.000 or 1.000.000 years from now. Because that's intrinsic, what you do or don't doesn't and can't change it. You may add graphene oxide to it or other metal to change it, but then it's not copper, is a new material or league, copper itself will never change.What you're saying when you imply something will have some value on the future, is the concept os store-value. Store value doesn't imply that thing will worth the same, more or less than now, it just implies it will worth something. You can do it with anything that doesn't decay: Bitcoin, gold, empty soda cans collection, rocks found at the river... out of 7 billion people you surely will find someone to buy something, so everything has some value.
But you still can't express that value, don't know how much it is or can be. It's just something > 0, but nothing specific.Same rules would apply to so many things, Facebook, Twitter, 90%+ of NASDAQ have absolutely no intrinsic or fundamental value whatsoever, yet you don't see a guy coming out everyday speaking of its "intrinsic value", do you? But usability doesn't provide value on its own, nothing does. Value is always relative to how much one wants to pay and the other to receive. Be it crypto, gold or potatoes.For an instance, gold has very little industrial application, less by day on jewelry and yet its value goes up, because usability is unrelated to value.The belief on "intrinsic value" was part of the problem at 2008 crisis. Real estate, like anything else, depends on supply and demand rules for its value and it eventually came down. There's nothing more annoying than keep listening to some idiots, and idiots that are supposed to know what they are talking about, speaking about "intrinsic value".Let's put this straight once and for all: There's no such thing as intrinsic value!Intrinsic means something a thing has on its own, regardless of human intervention. What things have is intrinsic properties; gold has the intrinsic property of resisting erosion, copper has the intrinsic property of conduct electricity, and so on. But none has value on its own.Value is always attributed, never intrinsic! As long as all you can think of it is its USD value and your only hope is to buy for few USD and sell for more USD, then it's a bubble... and this isn't valid for Bitcoin alone, this is as valid for Bitcoin as it is for gold, oil, potatoes or any asset you're inventing in.Bitcoin is money on its own, you shouldn't be thinking on "how much USD (or other fiat) I'll get with this", but "what's the purchase power of Bitcoin", how many potatoes can a Bitcoin buy, how many Bitcoins it take to buy a house... basically what you do with USD (or whatever fiat is legal tender where you are). Curious, isn't it? The massive devaluation of USD happened by late 2016, December 2017 is a nearly flat line.Basically USD devalued so much that a tiny move will result on a mountain at the other end. Most of people still thinks by what they are more used to, an European will say the Euro worth 1.20 USD whereas an American will say the USD worth 0.8 EUR.So most people just does the same for BTC, they think on how much fiat a BTC worth but never care to check the opposite: how much BTC the fiat worth. And here things get interesting. You see that huge climb at December to 20k? If you see it on the opposite site it just looks like a flat line.At the moment everybody keeps saying BTC worth 9000 something USD, but nobody sees it means each USD worth ~0.0001 BTCHere's a peek at the other side of the mirror:1 Year view3 month view Currency is meant to be useless, it just needs 1 functionality: be a mean of exchange.Adding features to currency is nothing but a mistake, and ETH is nothing but a framework for ICO scams, which are multiplying by the minute. If you want to build services around a currency, Bitcoin has more than what is needed for it. Stop comparing shitcoins to Bitcoin... it's ridiculous! No backers would be as true to Bitcoin as it is to US Dollar or any currency around.As for "intrinsic value", there's no such thing in this world. Materials have intrinsic properties, but value is 100% subjective and relative. Value derives essentially from supply and demand, not from "how hard it is to make" or even on "how scarce it is". One thing can be hard to make and scarce and still have no value, as long as there's no demand for it, or can be easy and common and still have value, as long as it has demand. Have a good reading:https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Regression_theorem His statement was around "I don't know what it is and will not care to look into it". This is basically what he said, but the sensationalist bs media twisted his words to other meaning.He's just an old rich man, won't pay to spend time studying new technologies for him. You're aware that the whole USDt on circulation sums up to 2 bln, right?However yes, it's a scam and will certainly impact BTC and alts, but not to the hight you're talking about. I don't think they can store such a value at a bank account, their whole business is shady and hard to explain. Also it was meant to be redeemable, means that you could transform them back to USD, which would cause your USDT to be destroyed, yet it seams no USDT was ever destroyed. Nobody would redeem it? Not even for curiosity? Suspicious, to say the least... Sorry if I didn't properly explain myself, my point is about BTC markets. Due to this "magic money making machine" the market could be inflated and in the verge of collapse as soon as Tether collapses, a MtGox part 2.0. Do you think this is a point of concern or the exchanges on "Tether steroids" won't be able to hurt the market? USDT is leaving some people unrest.At a glance, it's basically fiat without a trustworthy counterpart, "magic money" at will.What's your view on this subject and what consequences may be expected? Tens razão, P2SH dá as mesmas hash nas duas redes.O que é um bom sinal, basta importar a private key dessa hash do cliente Bitcoin no de Litecoin. 33WbHkUAwGxdwCQHj2YioYWeEENTHzRo9N não é um endereço Bitcoin! Endereços Bitcoin começam por 1.https://live.blockcypher.com/ltc/address/33WbHkUAwGxdwCQHj2YioYWeEENTHzRo9N/ Yes, they just go to the one that's vacant. So don't get surprised to see a guy coming out of women's or a girl coming out of men's.This seams more normal outside Paris.In a way they've a point, usually you see a huge queue at women's restroom and none at men's, this way they just get things going more gender equally. Eu não digo que compres ou não compres, é uma escolha tua.No entanto convém saber o que é XRP, a moeda do Ripple.O XRP não é nem uma bitcoin nem comparável à maioria das crypto, o XRP é um token centralizado, mais comparável à Liberty Reserve ou e-Gold que outra coisa.Assim sendo tem um risco acrescido, ao contrário das outras, que podem valer 1.000.000 ou 0,000001 mas não desaparecem mesmo que seja proibido aqui ou acolá, a Ripple pode desaparecer simplesmente. E basta que apareça um esquema de negócios escuros a usar XRP e *puf*, vai tudo dentro e acabou. @Sithara007,India is overcrowded, so over 1,3 bln people some oddities may surface and even become "norm".@zenyfomax1,They had that issue in the past, now it's a 70 fine. Still wasn't that "poop everywhere" situation.The major oddity I found at France is the way they use public restrooms; they simply go to the one that's vacant, regardless of the gender. Actually, no, they aren't... don't know where you got that one from.
São 120 páginas de posts! Mas não me recordo de alguma vez ter publicado um endereço meu. Apenas uma vez publiquei aqui uma foto de uma das minhas primeiras carteiras,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=326514.msg6136942#msg6136942Vou ver se a encontro novamente e assinar algo com uma daquelas chaves.Entretanto e vendo o meu histórico, pergunto-me porque já não se fazem promoções destas:Code:Re: [PROMOTION] Get 5 BTC and 5 USD for joining Bitcoin2Cash!(eu até dispensava os 5 USD...)E o momento em que eu acho que abri a caixa de Pandora das altcoins:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6955.msg101953#msg101953...e a minha reacção quando elas começaram a aparecer (IxCoin):https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=39696.msg484414#msg484414EDIT: Old wallet encontrada. Aqui vai, assinado conforme essa imagem que eu partilhei há muito tempo:Endereço: 1N5qbLMTy4u4PbQhSeHPPyCzxZ2fcWE5NHMensagem:Code:Aqui está a prova. Assinado com um bloco que eu próprio minei. :)Assinatura:Code:GwKlpGMAnHablhY3fae3NaD1tVa2FDjk8ectWNlu+F0YdxhweNnfuxhTiRvgZJTwZN75SYERi3qIgF6sB18MfaI= Peço desculpa.Eu desenterrei o tópico mas para dizer que o meu antigo nick foi roubado por esse gajo aí do avatar vermelho. One day, back in 2011, I went to sleep with it around 30 USD, woke up the next morning with it at around 3 USD. A 90% drop over night. Ultimamente, desde a Bitcoin Cash, temos tido uma autêntica avalanche de hard forks. Para mim são porreiras para testar algum código mais arriscado que não iria tentar na Bitcoin, e como tal tenho andado a explorar esta nova tendência, aqui fica o que tenho a dizer sobre elas:Bitcoin Cash: a única que vale alguma coisa.Bitcoin Gold: vale alguma coisita, tem alguns bugs de código mas é usável e muito rápida a confirmar.Super Bitcoin: compilei o código ontem, mas parece porreirita para testar.A evitar:Bitcoin Hot: só têm os binários já compilados. Podem ficar com eles...Bitcoin Diamond: moedas do 007 só se for em filme, github vazio, código fechado.Bitcoin X: não tem releases, mas o site é muito "phishy".Nada, por enquanto:Bitcoin Platinum: o cliente compilou mas não se conecta a nenhum peer.Por ver:UnitedBitcoinAnunciadas a sair brevemente:Bitcoin Cash PlusBitcoin GodBitcoin UraniumLightning BitcoinBitcoin InterestBitcoin Lite Calma jay_pal! A malta habitua-se aos tópicos redundantes...Quanto ao ETH, se alguém quer saber até onde vai aquilo é muito simples: tente sacar a blockchain! Com tanta "feature" e gatos virtuais e o raio, só um Core i7 com 64 Gb de RAM é que lá vai, o que fará dela em pouco tempo algo totalmente inútil dada a dificuldade de a processar.Arrepiando caminho, a "outra da moda", Ripple, está mais centralizada que o Liberty Reserve e basicamente serve para o dono criar moedas à vontade. Cuidado com aquilo! Por isso é que nunca recomendei investir em Bitcoins a ninguém por aqui. A iliteracia financeira é tal que aqueles depósitos bancários que pagam 0,01% TAN já é investimento de risco para a generalidade! First you need to know what they are.Crypto is also fiduciary, this means, like fiat, isn't backed by anything other than trust. In fiat you trust its issuer, in Bitcoin you trust the blockchain. Unlike fiat the blockchain won't let you issue currency at will and won't let you be "less trustworthy", like the central banks of Venezuela or Zimbabwe.The current only advantage of fiat, namely its biggest currencies, like USD or EUR, is price stability. A piece yet to be achieved by crypto which is highly volatile. Indonesia is pretty different from region to region. Bali is mainly Hindu and more tolerant, whereas Sumatra is hell on Earth sponsored by "the religion of peace", Java depends on the city, my older daughter already got some troubles at Kedhiri (again sponsored by the "religion of peace") but not on other East Java cities...Lately I had a friend looking to invest at Lombok, asked my ex and she just replied: Muslims... Considerando que fazer 1LRUSD por mês em PTCs já seria bom, de facto o nome do site era um bocadinho exagerado.  Não, não é publicidade, é um site que existia para aí em 2009/10 da malta que se dedicava a PTCs e PPVs e onde anunciei pela primeira vez a minha "descoberta" à comunidade tuga: A Bitcoin!Haverá por aqui alguém que tenha vindo desses tempos? Pelo que percebi o Ricardo tinha que fazer o contraditório. Como não o encontrou, inventou-o.A única diferença da Bitcoin para a moeda convencional é que é a primeira que é deflacionária, mas isso deve-se ao facto também de ser a primeira que é verdadeiramente limitada na sua emissão.Se "choca" a moeda valorizar >1000%, não nos podemos esquecer que moedas convencionais, como o Bolívar Venezuelano ou o Dólar Zimbabweano desvalorizam muito mais que isso num ano. Aqui a única diferença está no existir ou não limitações à emissão.O USD e o EUR apenas não desvalorizam à mesma velocidade pelo peso das respectivas economias e por terem bancos centrais um pouco mais responsáveis nas regras da sua emissão. Mas isso não garante nada no futuro, basta remover os rácios bancários para o EUR passar a valer menos que notas de monopólio. I wish I'd a satoshi for each time I listened or read somewhere any of the follow:When bitcoin is up:- Last chance! It will drop soon! Run! Run! Run!- It's a Ponzi, it will crash soon!- The bubble is about to burst!When it's down:- I told you, it was going to crash!- It will never come up again, tomorrow will be at 0,1 USD!... I'd been married to an Indonesian woman, from which we've two girls.For the country itself is as beautiful as any tropical place you can think about, however the human side is extremely poor. Religion being its biggest stone on the shoe, with regions you surely wouldn't want to go, specially those more Islamic, then the endemic corruption, making it hard to move the country forward.Nevertheless is a country to look up to in terms of investment with a huge market, be it internal or tourism. Still for risk assessment it must be taken as medium-high, and being so different from region to region you can't consider the country as whole. Well... that's without internet for starters.  Even so they had their forms of money and conduct trade.  Esperar que as altcoins venham a valer tanto quanto a Bitcoin é como esperar que uma réplica da Mona Lisa valha tanto quanto o quadro original que está no Louvre.Se um dia aparecer alguma que seja realmente original pode valer a pena, porquanto sejam apenas réplicas da Bitcoin com ou sem add-ons, dificilmente passarão dessa qualidade. Certo, mas vamos ao artigo de onde eles sacaram essa informação:http://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/mercados/detalhe/bitcoins-nao-sao-legais-mas-podem-ter-de-pagar-impostos Isso é a interpretação de um fiscalista, dos vários que foram entrevistados pelo JNegócios nesse artigo.Não me parece totalmente correcta, porque podes vender apenas a portugueses e, para ganhos no estrangeiro, tens que ter enquadramento legal nesse estrangeiro e respectivas notas de liquidação de impostos, se houver. Também estou um bocado céptico em relação aos futuros, mas espero que ajudem a estabilizar a cotação.A flutuação nestas magnitudes, apesar de para um gajo como eu que anda nisto desde finais de 2009 ser benéfica, gera problemas de gestão na vida real. Isto porque se torna uma situação em que "today I got a million, tomorrow I don't know".Quanto aos montantes, também nunca transferi quantias malucas para o meu banco. Eu nunca escondi ao banco a origem dos fundos, nunca lhes disse que tinha gajas na Alemanha. Aliás um bancário até me pediu uma bitcoin em prata (aquelas moedas com o símbolo) e pagou-ma. Curiosamente o único problema que tive foi com "uma gaja Alemã" no LBC, ao que parece é comum alguns alemães irem ao banco para ficar com as bitcoins e o dinheiro de volta. Cuidado com isso!Já passei horas ao telefone com as finanças e ainda não existe enquadramento legal para as declarar. Quando existir é cumprir a lei que for determinada. That's kind a tricky, the only constant in this world is its inconstancy. Everything may be lost.
Bem... não cliquei no link de phishing mas, como a base de dados deste site é hackeada dia sim dia também e eu não mudava a pass há muito tempo fiquei sem a minha conta (BCEmporium).Reactivei a minha conta anterior a essa, já que quem me roubou a conta a está a utilizar como se fosse dele... Welcome to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.It turns out that when you no longer have needs your life will basically becomes empty, without a goal or objective, so you get to stack new needs, like bullshit activism or endless greed in order to provide you some meaning to life. First of you need to know what is money. Unlike the common belief money isn't "to buy things", instead it's used to "limit your access to resources", otherwise the planet would be long depleted (or not because nobody would bother to harvest them).On the second part money provides a peaceful way of trade. Without money the only way you can get anything from anyone would be stealing it or, if you want a service, to enslave him.The "without money" dream would be like if you would go to a restaurant for a free meal, but the cook and the staff are sit on the next table waiting for someone to serve them too, as they're no more no less than you. Nothing to see here, move along.Bottom line, that guy isn't Satoshi and his story makes no sense. So, what we will make "Goxed" stand for?a) Be scammed: «Hey dude! You'd been goxed!»b) A place where they do things their way without give a damn for what others may think or not of it: «Jizz man! That place's admin is such a gox!»c) A place that lacks basic security opening its users to be hacked: «That site is such a gox!» or «Got goxed by using site X!» H4x0Rz of the World, unite! For the lamers are already united...   PM me your details, I'll credit the difference between what you got and what you should get.I've to take some time to debug that thing out.Really sorry. Well... there're no "casino owners", it's just my pet project, not BWin ehehehehIt has no bet limit amount, but I'll need to trim it out on some features.Blackjack has been disabled, and I'll disable the casino for a while to debug it as soon as possible. Unfortunately I'm in the middle of two projects to finish up the end of this month.I may also rebuild it to Flash CS4 or CS5. Thus the engine is PHP. All the flash does is the frontend. But the code from Jackpot soft is a mess... If you're thinking about a real money casino made with this software, you'll have a lot to debug prior to go live. Yup, all processment is manual.You can request your 3 coins, just handle it by the system to update your account automatically - otherwise I would need to process it manually twice Don't forget to add to the equation that "generate OR NOT" BitCoins is a sort of lottery.Whereas sometime ago I use to generate at least 50 BC/day, now the last time I generated a 50 BC chunk was 7 days ago.So, as it gets harder to generate, its value increases. Isn't like "cost more to produce" but rather "they're more rare". Like gold, the value of gold in the wild is 0, plays no important role on the Nature, yet it takes some work to dig out, so here it's value increases by production costs, but so does Iron, Copper, Tin and all other metals that have a way less value than gold. From it's physic attributes, gold, ain't nothing special either. Not resistent as iron or its leagues, not good for electronics as silver or copper, there isn't much to do with gold on practical life, other than jewellery... the only thing to notice is that it can't get waisted with time, doesn't corrode or erode (aluminium just doesn't corrode, but gets eroded with time).But in the end what makes the final value of gold for our species is that you can't find gold anywhere. Isn't a sort of abundant metal. Yaykes!Sorry, yes, my car got broke and I went check for a new one. Really sorry.But, gosh! Looks like I've to set a minimum deposit, I had A LOT of them like 1 to 5 BC... :S The play for fun algorithm isn't working, all it replies back to the software is error=1 (means : pick something the user didn't).I may put "for fun" mode working, but by now I lack some freetime to do it. It could be used the emule style and register a protocol handle for bitcoin client. So the shop could create link as such:bitcoin://address-to-pay-to|amount|order hash or id|some other fieldsIn the end it would resume to such:<a href="bitcoin://mybitcoin.com|20|aAAee3322AA67|CustomerId=20><img src="paywithbitcoins.jpg" border="0" title="Pay now" /></a> Well... unless he's really a hard ass cheater, the prize pool would avoid such. "Buying 10K tickets" to himself would raise the main pot... means that if it comes that he looses to someone else, he would need to pay up from those 10K tickets.But, there're 6/49 and all flavours of lotto on every country, why not simply use the official results instead of a own-made generator? That way everybody knows the system ain't rigged. The walkaround for this I saw so far was to create a new BC coin address per transaction.But it doesn't appear to me as a good solution.  Put things this way; if you manage (on a more or less distant future, don't know) to run sort of a shop on surface web* with BC, you may want:» Your customers to be identifiable - to know who is paying what and handle refunds» Your customers to leave notes along with the payment.» Your customers to have a friendly address to pay to (not an IP, not an unreadable hash) - unless you run thenerdsshop.com there is.» Your customers to not be nagged.For this would be obviously interesting a TLS/SSL feature. Imagine this operation:Client -> send BC 50 to bcpay.mysite.combcpay.mysite.com -> send a certificate with the store's data, client's get a popup with this server's information to confirmeg:You're about to make a payment to the following Bitcoin client:SITE NAME: mystore.comCOMMON NAME: Payments GatewayCA VERIFIED BY: BitcoinSSLClient -> Confirm ? payment is sent: payment is cancelled.* Tor users: Let's call it a surface web shop shipping goods to your house, so you wouldn't go there anyway. What would be the point of hide your IP while give your home address? The idea of send by DCC is to simplify.It's not like put 1000 USD over a rock, the attacks are "theoretically easy" but on practical not, unless your ISP attacks you... but if it does so, why not attack your bank account instead? Except maybe for cable access where your neighbor can sniff you.This bitcoin.org:19vcWM6EEbQHVdN2W8NXv9ySgsPjbZ6gU3@12.34.56.78 is about as practical as nothing. What would be the simplification-add of such? Try to say to someone over the phone your BC address on such manner.Let's do one thing, right: PUT TOR ASIDE. One thing is using BC for anonymous payments / OTHER is to make non-anonymous payments.If you're up to do anonymous payments, that's already sorted: Use BC address and that's it.It's then a matter of choices, if for security reasons you feel more confortable with it disabled, do it like: Disabled by default / Enable if you want and know what you're doing.Someone could hijack my site and show another BC address-Someone could hijack your site and show another PayPal email also. Defacings aren't however easy to do, you don't see sites defaced everyday.Someone could hijack DNS to resolve to something else-Someone could hijack your bank's login and make you pass over your password to it... again DNS hijack/spoof isn't also that easy to do. Theoretically (again) it is, but that would be if you were using some bogus Nameserver. If you use your ISP defaults it would be rather complicated. And if someone invaded your PC to make it change DNS's, then that same one would open your BC Client and send all your BC's to his address.So, in the end, my proposal is:Split the "project idea" in two different (way different) branches:1 - Anonymous payments - Using BC Address exclusivelly2 - Non-anonymous (regular) payments - Using BC Addresses OR DCC.It makes no sense at all to use Tor arguments over branch 2. Let's put this way: You're just seeing your side, you don't know how many players are there and whether they're winning or loosing.At the very moment you went up to 200+, somebody else (not in the same slot but on the same algorithm) went down that much.Just like life: To someone win, someone else has to loose... Here we go again...YES, you can be phished, hijacked, whatever... but, again, it has to rely on informed options rather than behaviors of "I decided this is more secure to you".  D҉ataWraith,DNS is the simplest of protocols, all it does is to have a database, cache or forward to next DNS a request.Basically goes like this:you type: nslookup www.somesite.comYou computer goes to your resolv.conf or network config, according to your OS, pick your Nameserver and say:«Hey! Dude! What the hell means www.somesite.com?»The Nameserver looks it up if has it on its cache or database will reply: «Yo! Man! That's 123.123.123.123», if not will look it up and reply if find or will say «M'a man, there's no such a thing on the internet as far as I can tell!».However someone may spoof the Nameserver and reply to your computer with a wrong address, which your computer will take for "the real deal".The issue with DNSSEC is that, thus it's usable for root and authoritarian nameservers, it isn't for clients.The difference?Normally you must read on a ns lookup:Reply without authoritywww.somesite.com 123.123.123.123This means the server that's replying to you knows where www.somesite.com is, but it's not the nameserver for such domain. - This is what your ISP NS's do normally.On the other side you've the authority nameservers, means those whose the domain is registered to. Those update the root servers and yes, between those two, makes perfect sense update the root servers under a secure line to prevent some other nameserver as present itself as an authority to a domain it's not - which would spoof the address internet wide.Now... clients does A LOT of DNS requests, it's normal that when you visit a page that page to have items stored somewhere else. For each "some where else" your computer does a DNS request... now just imagine if it has to negociate a certificate with the nameserver before.As for attacks, it's something you must count on, but I do prefer to have users aware of the danger rather than go Fascist like imposing limitations to what they can do.Security has to be moderate by the hazard, you probably would check your wallet every minute on a bus to see if it's still on your pocket if you carry like $1000, but you don't if you carry just 1 or 2 bucks. Likewise it would make the same sense to protect a computer bank-like if the user just has there a couple of pirate MP3.  
Sure does, that's what a certificate does: Hey! You're on www.somewebsite.com and the data is crypted.The question is that, imagine somewebsite is meant to be at 123.123.123.123 and someone else spoofed DNS for it to resolve to 123.123.123.124, then your browser will believe it is at www.somewebsite.com - even if it's phishing.And for free certificates, they might include the security they want, but no browser recognizes their root CA's, so it makes them as worthable (and will raise the very same alerts) a self-signed certificate.DNSSEC is yet another piece of junk. That probably would never come to be nothing but a project. Issues of practical life, negociating crypt algorithms reduces performance and DNS is a really heavy duty service. So, if someone tries to implement DNSSEC as a standard, internet would probably become as slow as Tor is.And if someone doesn't want the one he's paying to to know his address, probably the person that's receiving the payment doesn't want to show his address either. Therefore they simply DON'T use DCC Pay, but P2P Pay. Easy... as long as both options are there.I'm up to choices not to paranoia. Paranoia in security isn't of any value add, paranoia is just that... paranoia. Reduces life quality, grants nothing and prevents people from live.Yes, someone may steal your data, as someone may steal your wallet on the bus with the very same outcome. There're some security elementals, but you can't keep looking over your shoulder (specially because you probably will miss to see the electrical post in front of you).   Leave Tor aside, that would be more "Man in the Center" rather than "Man in the Middle".  As for the attacks on websites with BC addresses, you may deface them, and you may spoof even without the server's Private Key. Normally people don't look to the CA, so as long as the CA is recognized it will ring no bells - and within this "world", specially for Tor users, Verisign Certificates aren't the normal thing, but CACert and other free services alike (means also many users are already used to press "Continue" on invalid certificate flags).If by anymeans you got the server's private key then it doesn't make no difference, for your browser that Certificate is signing that address and, as far as DNS can tell, that server is there.Edit: To not mention the obvious: If you know the destination's IP Address why on Hell you would need to use Tor to pay?? And if the address would be something like <some unreadable hash>.onion then you wouldn't need SSL, because inner Tor data is already crypted. Botnets aren't just for DDoS, it can be used for other purpouses - can perform anything its master tells them to - including download BC Client and cast votes.But I'm not being critic, the issue is that you're using votes on polls generated by the system to a bet system. That's a noway thing to do.One thing is:Who will win the next game?- Team A- Draw- Team BThis is what uncertain future event stands for.Other thing would be:What's your favorite color?-Red-Yellow-Green-BlueThis is an opinion cast or survey, and it makes no sense to bet on its outcome. Because you're starting a question yourself for a non-event and use the number of replies as the outcome, which becomes a redudancy and a result "ad populum".Opinions Ad Populum are natural fallacies, like "Many people believes in God" - such has no influence at all to determine whether God exists or not. People beliefs and likes/dislikes doesn't qualify then to create valid results on itsown about anything.   And if you leave your house you can be hit by a car. Oh! Wait! If you remain at home a plane may crash over your roof.  MiM attacks that can perform defacing can perform it on all the ways - with or without SSL. Like spoof your DNS and make your browser believe to be seeing the "right page".The only way to be 100% secure on informatics is to be offline with the computer switched off from power. As long as it is on, there're a few "thousands" of possibilities and... sh*t happens.   You can use any flavor:Lotto 6/49Euromillions 5/50+2/9or anyotherI was once thinking on create a sports (Soccer) 1X2 betting system, but on such time it was with Euros and... taken bet with that currency is "somewhat" illegal on my country and I couldn't afford a P.O. Box on Cayman Islands (and hire micro-dwarfs to work in the "office"   ), I drop the project.Maybe I can revive it for BCs. theymos:Like I said; if it worth it.There're some random vars to add too, as to know when someone will send something.But, yes, TLS would be nice, why make things easier to steal when we can do it a bit harder? TLS adds some good security without cut too much usability.I wouldn't care for ISP's anyway, if you mistrust them that much as I said before, you rather not make a phone call anymore on your life, taken telecom companies can easily tap it. But for those using proxies, some user-run proxies, yes, authenticate over plain text for those is a russian roulette. But a man in the middle can also intercept the key negociation for OpenSSL and decrypt the packets.If BC goes as payment standard other attacks may come along, as forging hashes.This round about for the eternal question: Does it worth it?Like Windows and Linux, none is safer than the other, Windows has registry, in time it has autoexec.bat, but so does Linux have .bashrc, inetd, xined and several ways to put "crap on boot", to not mention Linux is OpenSource and this may be a security hole because Open Source doesn't mean "Open only for the right people", but "Open for the wrong as well". Still the number of virus and malaware for Windows is astronomical compared with those available for Linux. Why? Simple... Windows has the biggest market share. If it happens to be the other way around than it would be more profitable to make crap for Linux than Windows things would go the otherway around. Well, my friend:If for entering a bet one has to already bet at least once it means the system will never start. Since noone would be able to start the first poll.Spammers can't "forge results" but get people to vote for "their bet", also those with botnets would have a huge advantage here.As for generate BC, sure, perfectly possible, you can have several machines generating BC's and output them all to a single address upon creation. Just the value of BC and the uncertain whether and when you'll create some makes such system not profitable.In the end; you can't run bets on polls generated by the betting system itself. Bet has to be on something the betting system isn't related or can't predict the outcome. That's the essence...   Sure, encryption would be a good feature, TLS for an instance. About ISP's, and mainstream internet, if you don't trust them you rather not make also a phone call anymore.But isn't quite "like login to a bank without HTTPS", one can intercept a single BC transfer but doesn't get the hability to start further bitcoin transfers on hisown; which would happen if it was your bank login instead.Still there's room for both: DCC and Address transfers. Such relies more on "who and why" are you paying than the payment itself. That's not "for everyone", but for those up to buy or sell some stuff more... strange.I believe the core aim of BC is to be an easy to carry non-centralized currency, anonimity is a surplus not a mandatory field. Otherwise we would rather call it TorPay.So, unless the transaction is for the a new pedo movie, some crack shipment or some stuff alike, there's no reason to use Tor, and therefore no exit nodes and no proxies. In the end trimming your advice: If you're up to make a "non conventional" payment over Tor, use the destination's BC Address, if you're buying or selling something normal, use IP or BC address.  Then we've the eternal ballance: Usability x Security. Too much security = too few usability (the most secure computer in the planet is... anyone since it's switched off) and too much usability = too few security. Ballance is better than paranoia.   Betting has to be concise on a specific event, not abstract. Therefore it makes no much sense, looks like some odd sort of "ad Populum".Eg. "What will be the outcome of game A", "Who will be the next president of B". You can't run betting on polls when those polls are generated by the betting system itself, 'cause that would result on the same always: the best spamer wins and I doubt someone is up to promote spam around.   A «guess the number I'm thinking» game would make more sense than that.   I believe that you're also looking to BC in a linear mode, as if it was always generating bitcoins chunk after chunk when instead it runs more like a sort of "lottery". You can generate 50 bc/day, 200 bc/day or... none, and as the network grows this last thing is the most likely to happen.Also as the network grows the "proof-of-work" grows along, bc generators may start to run up to the next year or next 2 years, or rather not run them at all, taken they would take 1 month to update and process the existing nodes.What the network seams also to miss is a way to generate high input of transactions, services, games, stuff to spend and earn BC's and make it flow. At least the Windows client seams unable to resolve hostnames - or doesn't even try, pops up an "Invalid Address" right away.This is a huge setback taken most people have dynamic IP Addresses. Therefore, instead of "123.123.123.123" only it should be added the hability to send also to "someone-accepting-bitcoins.somedomain.sometld". Using the bitcoin client as a bet broker would make it a "token bet place" and not a "currency".But you can make a bet site based on bitcoins, just like my casino runs on it. Oh, that's what that symbol is, bahts. Didn't know, been to Indonesia and Singapore but never to Thailand.  Yes, indeed, I've to review the entire Blackjack engine that came along, it seams to have some bugs. For me it already showed up two diamond jacks saying "Dealer have blackjack".   Also came with a bug on the roullette that allowed bets with negative ballance (fixed).About the Aristocrat, is about as profitable as any other slots, no bugs, just odds. What's the char code/html code of such character?! Man... you used "the system" in the roullette. I've to say "sorry, but «the system» doesn't work". Not online and not on real casinos. Loose and double up = loose^2. Luckily it was bitcoins, if it were Euros or USD would be much worse.  Put things this way: If «the system», be it on the roullette or blackjack, would work casinos would bankrupt. But "the system" has a big "hole", as you loose you double up, but if you start with 1 and loose 10 times in a row you would be loosing 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128+256+512 = 1023, and would need to find 1024 for the next bet.To make it "worse", machines are programmed to let win according to the casino's bank. This means if the casino has waged 1000 and, like mine, is set to pay up 98% (and this is pretty much, taken regular casinos pay up 80 to 85%), there's no way somebody will win a hand over 980. Ok, in your case you already put the bank 98% of 1023, but meanwhile someone playing on the slots just get 100, this means the bank got 100 short. And then you have the "winning coefficient", it exists to prevent a single player from take the whole bank at once - which would leave the other players with nothing left to be won. This secondary system is set for 70% - means per hand at maximum you may wage 70% of the whole casino's bank.In fact, in the casino, players play against each others leaving some margin to the house, nobody plays against the house.Anyway, as I manually fed the bank with my own BC, here's the statistics so far:TOTAL PROFIT: -493.53  spndr7: Deposits: 1 bc, games played: none, withdraws: 1 bc  Checked and withdraw done. Well, casino (normal ones that is) does handle a lot of payments manually - those who come by wire transfer. Isn't that different, even thus that "From: Unknown" is a bit... maybe there should be a way to prevent the sender from "vanish".What do you mean use bitcoin cents as sign? If this goes alright, I hire you for Operator later then  By now I'm fixing and checking nicks and nacks of the system, still need to fix the roullette... at this moment I'm working out the Progressive Jackpots and slots (almost done).
